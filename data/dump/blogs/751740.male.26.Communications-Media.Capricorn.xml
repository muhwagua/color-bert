       10 REASON WHY I AM A FREAK!   1.  I don't like vegetables 2.  I don't just sneeze, I have sneezing fits! 3.  I still play with LEGOS...including Star Wars legos 4.  I'm hairy 5.  I shed 6.  I shed but I still have a lot of hair. 7.  I can crack my knuckles anytime time 8.  I can make owl calls 9.  I have red sideburns even though I have black hair! 10. I live in a bubble...well...not literally!  I freely admit that I am a freak.  I say that because I hate the word "normal".  When we say someone is not "normal", who are are comparing them to?  Us?  If we do that, we do we compare ourselves to then?  There are over 6 billon people in this world....so is just one person normal?  If everyone was the same......we would be boring!  There would be no varity in the world....no color, no definition!   I tell a friend constantly that she is weird!  That is a compliment because that means she is unique!!!!  So that is why I am a freak....because I am unique!!!!  So the next time you say "They are not normal!".....ask yourself....   ARE YOU?   So, I dare you to make a list of what makes you a freak....uh...unique...and send them to your friends!  I'm sure it will be fun!

       I await for her, my true love to be, ever so patiently along the path of eternity. I know not her name, never spoken, nor her presence, never felt. But by will of God, or simple fate, I will meet my life's true soul mate. The time will come when angels sing and heavens part, my true love is close, telling me by the heavy beating of my heart.   A poem that I soon hope to finish.  Like life....it will continue and change.  I know at times I lose hope....but I know that life has it's surprises.  I pass forth this poem and messege to all who read this.....don't lose heart or hope in your search!  Share your troubled heart and soul to those closest to you.  You'll be surprised that they face the same challenges.

      You know....I keep saying over and over....I can't help but wonder how we, as a species, survived the Middle Ages!  I ask myself that after working in the ticket office at Monticello again today.  People can be sooooo dumb at times!  They can ask the most dumbest questions like..."Is this Monticello?" or ask what the prices are when there's a big white sign in front of them telling them!  I can't help but think of what my father says to me when I ask a stupid question...."IF IT HAD TEETH, IT WOULD BITE YOU!!!" I don't think I have the patience to work there anymore.  I don't think I have patience dealing with stupidity....even though I'm guilty of it myself sometimes!  I don't think I can work in customer service.  My supervisor asked if I could work a few days in September or October.....I DON"T THINK SO!!!!

       EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS!!!!   No...I'm not talking about a line of four sorority sisters!  Close though!!!!  I'm talking about the movie that's out which I went to see today.  It's one of those "B-movie" movies about a group of giant mutated spiders that go rampant on a small little town.  It stars David Arquette and Keri Wurher.   Now I was actually surprised with David Arquette in this movie.  Most of his recent movies....except for the rare few like Scream....were just crappy with him in it.  Though it was a bad movie....he did a decent part with it!  I still don't understand why Courtney Cox is married to him!   Keri Wurher, who is always a hottie, played the strong female role as the sheriff of the little town.  I like those strong female roles.....I love to see them kick ass!  Though the only thing I couldn't believe from her in this role was that she played a mother of two.  She isn't that old...though in the movie they explained this by saying she had a kid at 16.  Still if she was a mom....she still is a hottie! So as a personal critic to this "B-movie" movie.....I would give it a D+.  I would just save your money and wait for it on video.  Actually, if you really can't wait to see this movie but don't want to spend the money.....I would just suggest mutating some spiders on your own and release them on a small little town.  May I suggest the town of Charlottesville?

       THATS ME WITHOUT YOU    A night with no moonlight; A day with no sun; A plane with no pilot; A watch that won't run; A tree with no branches; A rose with no petals; A boy with no sweetheart; That's me without you.  A train with no whistle; A car with no gas; A well with no water; A love with no future; A sky with no blue; A boy withno sweetheart; That's me without you.  A bank with no money; A top that won't spin; A book with no story; A love I can't win; A chair with no bottom; A rig with no crew; A song with no music; That's me without you.  A court with no jury; A church with no pew; A boy with no sweetheart; That's me without you.   This poem was written by my grandfather long ago to my grandmother.  He was in the Navy and this was written to her when they were apart.  They divorced in the 60's and he died 17 years ago.  I found this poem in his things when I went through some his stuff a  few years ago.  I was surprised to find this because as it happens, poetry seems to run in our family.....from my grandfather, to my father, and I started while I was High School. I'm sharing this with who ever is reading this because it does hold special meaning.  I'm the boy with no sweetheart.....I am not whole.  It's a Friday night and I am home.  I was just feeling a bit lonely and meloncholy tonight.  I hope others are whole!

      Funny story today at work:  I was talking to my supervisor, Jason, about me not knowing about vehicles.  It seems essential since I work at a Automotive car company!  Anyway, he tells that we have to find a way for me to learn more about vehicles through some sort of system.  Now at this point....realizing that I watch too many movies in my life time....I said that I do the same thing that happened in the movie "Major League 2".  Now for those that do not know the movie....here is a brief synopsis of it. 1.  It's a baseball movie 2.  In the movie...it's about a bunch of misfits on the Cleveland Indians 3.  The catcher...."Rube"... of the team has a problem throwing the ball back to the pitcher 4.  The assistant Manager....played by Tom Beringer.....thinks of a way for Rube to control his pitching to the pitcher 5.  The answer.....Rube reads Playboy....the manger tells Rube to think of Playboy playmates info and think about that when he is throwing back to pitcher.  So I thought of this when Jason was telling me this.  However, when I said that it was Major League 2....but he said it was Major League 1.  So we keep saying to each other what we thought was the right movie.  After a few minutes going back and forth, Jason says why don't we bet on this.  Now at this point I'm reluctant to bet even though I know I'm right.  At first we shake on it but we don't say what we win who ever is right.  I first suggest 10 bucks since I'm so poor!!!  Then he suggests that the loser buy the winner lunch!  So I say sure....why not. A few minutes later, Jason walks by and says he thought of something more funny to bet on!  He said who ever loses, has to wear a dress!!!!  I say to him that I can't wear a dress because of my hairy legs....but he is so willing to wear the dress since he believes he is right!!  Now what you didn't know is Jason is a very "big" guy!!!  I don't know if he could fit in a dress! Well, we finally decided to check on the internet to see which movie it was in.  We found out that I was right...it was in Major League 2.  Jason admitted that I was right!!!  WHOO HOOO!!!! Now at that point, when Jason suggested wearing a dress....Dana, whose cubicle is behind me...overheard us.  When she heard about the bet and Jason wearing a dress.....she started to crack up with laughter!!!  It was one of those long laughs that made her red in the face and cry!!!  Both of us at that point could not stop laughing for at least a half an hour when we thought of Jason wearing a dress!!!   Well...I guess it's one of those "Had to be there" moments!  But it did make me feel better for the rest of the day!

      A few weeks ago, I started my new postion for the company that I have been working for since the very beginning of the year.  When I started, I was downstairs with the rest of the customer service and support, as a Web Assistant.  Now, my new position as Dropship Data Specialist, I am working upstairs with management!  I can tell you that there is a difference between the two floors.  However, it didn't really sink in until today when I received my new chair....with arm rests!!!!  They had to order it for me too!!!!  I can't help but hear the theme song to the old television series  The Jeffersons .....the song...."Moving on Up"! ;)

      This song seems appropriate for tonight:   I close my eyes, only for a moment and the moment's gone All my dreams, pass before my eyes a curiosity Dust in the wind, All they are is dust in the wind Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea All we do, crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in  the wind Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky It slips away, all your money won't another minute buy Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind    KANSAS , "Dust in the Wind"

      My heart and soul go out to a dear friend of mine whose mom past away this morning.  I wish I could be there with her to hug and hold her and to wipe her tears away.  I wish I could say something to consol her in her hurt and saddness but I do want her to know that I'm am here for her if she needs me.  My prayers are for her tonight.

      A special friend sent me this song:   The world ways on my shoulders But what am I to do? You sometimes drive me crazy But I worry about you I know it makes no difference To what you are going through But I've seen the tip of the iceberg And I worry about you   Her story is that the song was passed to her by a friend during her trying times at the moment.  She thought she would share this with the people that she loved...friends and family.  It seems  appropriate at the moment since I don't feel well at the moment.  I'm glad to have friends that pass me along these messeges of caring.  I know a few out there that might be reading this should take heart that I care enough to worry about you.

      Yesterday I felt like shit!  The reason:  I had a sore throat when I woke up.  Now you are thinking...it's Sunday, you can stay in bed all day if you wanted to.  That wasn't the case.  I had to work on Sunday in the Ticket Office at Monticello....the home of Thomas Jefferson.  I stopped working there when I got my job here at Autosport at the beginning of the year.  The reason I worked in the Ticket Office is that Lee...the supervisor....needed a favor because he was short handed.  Actually I do it mostly because he knows me so well working that I can use him and Monticello as a reference!   Anyway, I thought I was going to be fine yesterday. WRONG!!!  You have to realize that on weekends in the summer, Monticello has about 3 thousand visitors aday!!!  I have to say the same thing to about half of them!!!  Usually at first if there are a few people at time that come up to the Ticket Office, all I have to do is to tell these people..."Line up behind the chimney and wait for the next shuttle".  It's not a problem when we have visitor service people directing them where to go.  However it gets crazy once the bulk of the visitors starts coming in. One by one, they keep coming in like an assembly line!!!  IT NEVER STOPS!!! When the visitors come in at a pace where there is no end, they start to ask the same questions:  "Where's the shuttle?" "Where's the house?"  Where do I line up for the tour?"  The kicker to this that when we get so many people coming, we start to use a system of time cards telling people when to line up for the tour.  I have actually worked on my speech to tell these people this and I use it over and over.  This is my speech:    "Once you buy your tickets, you line up for the shuttle behind the chimney to take you to the house.  When you get off, you will get a time card that tells you what time to be in line for the house tour.  In the mean time, you can tour the grounds and gardens."  It seems easy right?  Well, try saying that to each person that comes up to buy a ticket.  You get tired and frustrated, wishing that one of the visitor service people would tell them this.  They actually do sometimes, but then those same visitors that were told this, would ask you the same question!!!   Well, once your tired...and with me with the sore throat....your voice eventually begins to fade or you start to babble like I did yesterday.  The words from my speech started to run together or made no sense.  This is what It started to sound like:  "Once you bite your crickets, sign up for the snuggle behind the skinned knee.  When you get off, you will get a mime hard that sells you what sign to be in line for the horse tour.  I am a mean mime, you can tour the mound and harden."  See....it doesn't make sense!!!!  And I have to do it again next Sunday!

       RANDOM THOUGHT OF THE DAY  --If he shot the sheriff....then who shot the deputy?--  Well, I just finished watching "The Others" starring Nicole Kidman.  If you haven't seen....which if you do want to, don't read further....it try's to emulate the success of "The Sixth Sense".  Though I enjoyed it's suspenseful thriller like theme....I thought the movie was a bit slow and I was falling asleep in the middle of the movie.  If you haven't noticed yet....I have a way with words don't I!  And think, I could have gone and seen "Eight Legged Freaks" today instead of renting the "The Others"!

        EX GIRLFRIENDS/BOYFRIENDS    We all have them.  There are some you wish that you never dated.  Your life would have been much better if you never meet them. The fights, the lies, the heartache.....left from the shambles that was the relationship.  Then there were the ones that you never forget...never want to forget....because you wish they were still in your life.  You stayed up till the sun rose the next day talking to them, sharing the many hours of laughter and tears, remembering that first time you made love to each other, and hearing the sweet sound of "I love you" come from their lips.  You feel the world has ended when that day comes in losing them.  In either case, you move on, farther in life and make new relationships, but you never leave the memories behind.  However, what happens when you remain friends with your ex afterwards?  Does it become harder to know that the other is moving on with you?  You see them laugh with another and you wonder if that was the same laugh that they had with you.  Does it drive you crazy with jealousy that you are not the focus of their life?  And will this feeling end when you find someone else?  Is it true that is better to have love and lost then to have never loved before?  I guess the reason behind this entry is that I had an unusual dream about my last girlfriend last night.  We dated for about five months and this was actually my longest relationship I have had.  You know how it is....it starts out great when you meet, everybody thinks she is perfect for you....but after awhile things change, you know more about the other, and you start to grow apart.  In the dream, I am coming out of a shopping center/store into the parking lot.  I see three people walk toward me to store.  As they get closer, I see it is my ex-girlfriend hanging on the arm of another man and with her best friend.  She has changed her looks....less innocent but more mature.  They laugh and smile like there is no care in world.  As I walk past them, we both see each other gazing at the other. She gives me a stare like you give to someone who you recognize from your past but can't remember when and where you meet them.  She doesn't say anything and I don't say a word either....we just past each other under the lights of the parking lot.  It lasts a few seconds but it feels as though time stands still for this stare.  She then turns around, laughing and carrying on with her new love and best friend and I go to my car, alone in the dark.   I guess that's what I am afriad of with any relationship....to be forgotten, to be passed on.  I do not want to be just a memory or just another face in the crowd that you pass by.  But we all have to face that fear....we face the fact that we move on.     WE JUST MOVE ON

      You have to love mom!  So I'm watching the movie "Summer Catch" with Freddie Prinz Jr, which is about baseball.  My mom comes down to join me and starts watching it with me!  At first she is doing something else....I think writing letters or something.  After a while, I look over and there she is watching the movie.  I see this and ask her does she like the movie and she tells me yeah.  Not only is she watching it but she is actually liking it and getting into the whole story.  She "awww's" and "coo's" over the love story between the main characters, calling it young love!!!  I can't help but laugh at it.  She even starts crying when the two characters, Freddie Prinz and Jessica Beihl, love each other but can't see each other because they are on different sides of the "track".  The movie is so laughable and corny but my mom absolutely LOVES IT!!!!!  At the end, I regretfully ask how she likes and she replys..."It was a good movie!!!"  I just had to let out a big laugh at that point!!!!  Apparently she hasn't seen all of Freddie Prinz Jr's movies!!  Why should she.....if you see one.....you've seen them all!!! Well, that's about it that has happened today.  Tomorrow is Friday and I'm glad it's the end of the week!

      Do you ever stand in front of the mirror and wonder who you are looking at?  I do all the time.  It's like the person that I see is the not the person that I am.  I know the body is just the shell but do you ever feel the it's the wrong shell that you are looking at?  You look and stare but the image is still there......YOU!  But if you change something about it....you become a different person...or so you think.  Putting on makeup, dying your hair a different color, or in my case....growing a beard/goatee!  I notice that when I'm clean shaven, I feel "naked".  However when I have the goatee, I feel much different and oddly....normal!    The next thought that comes to mind is how other's see you!  Do they see the same thing that you see?  Most people never really see you as you are or you just become another face in the vast sea of faces of this world to them.  But for those that really do see you, do they see the same thing as you do?  You can't really come out and ask them because the answer is different each time.  One can see the ugly duckling in us while another can see the beautiful swan that we are!  Anyway it really doesn't matter because:     WE ARE WHO WE ARE

      So I finally took my parents out to dinner for their anniversery tonight.  They celebrated their 25th anniversery on July 1st.  They went to Las Vegas on their anniversery so I could not take them out for it.  Actually I was planning a surprise party for them with all our family and close family friends.  See, the hard part about trying to surprise my parents is for me to keep it a secret from them WHILE living at home with them.  It's harder keeping a secret from my father because he seems to know what is going on.  He keeps saying that he has spies all around and knows what I'm doing.  So, my plan was to let my aunts April and Wanda help out.  My initial plan was to hold a surprise dinner at the restaurant that my cousin Lesa owns.  I went to April first with the plan and she started to think about who to invite.  I was a bit hesitant when she began to spitting out names of friends that her and my mom knows.  I didn't want this to be a big thing!   I then asked my aunt Wanda and cousin Dee for help.  Dee actually suggested holding a dinner at the local hall above the Fire Department where I live!  Now at this point I thought..."How the hell am I going to convince my parents to come to this hall as a surprise....because every party we've been to has been there!  Keeping a secret from my father comes into the picture again!  He knows everything!  Well, I think the straw that finally broke the camel's back...or so to speak....was the suggestion of a band.  I can't afford a band, let alone the food and decorations!!!!  I'm broke....living on 8 dollars an hour....living with my folks!  Did I mention I live with my folks?  So I decided not to do the surprise dinner for my parents.  So, instead I took them out for dinner tonight and told them the whole story.  Well, you know mom!  She told me it was alright....but it wasn't to me!  I was disappointed because I set out to do something like the surprise and it fell to pieces!  What the hell am I going to do when I get a girlfriend/wife and kids if I can't even throw a party for my folks!  First of all...the moral of the story is....PLAN AHEAD....way ahead!  Secondly, just do it!  That is my advice.  Well......maybe I can plan for their 30th Anniversery......I got 5 more years!  We'll see.  So the movie "Braveheart" is on the t.v. now.  A great movie to say the least.  The one line that sticks out the most for me from that movie is when Braveheart (aka...Mel Gibson) says...."Every man dies.....not every man really lives."  I think it hits a point right now.  I don't feel like I'm truly living right now.  I'm here alone at the house that I'm house sitting for and I can't help but feel that life is just passing me by and I don't know what to do.  It's a scary thought!  My fear right now is that I'm going to grow old alone.  Eventually as I get older, that fear will get me to realize that I have to get my ass up and go out and socialize....make new friends....see new things!  Wish me luck!

      I have finally fallen to my temptation.  Lately I have been addicted to reading my friend's journals to find out what goes on in their lives!  I have asked myself what is the purpose of a journal being online?  For me, the answer is simple....for those that read my journal to get to know me.  For those that think that know me, do not.  But it is not their fault.  I do not open up that freely, even those that are "close" to me.  The question now is "Do you really want to know me?"

       THE EYES OF A STRANGER     As I walk down the halls, I see the eyes of a stranger. The eyes, those beautiful green eyes, that draw me towards her. Her eyes sparkle and shine, like emerald jewels in the sun. Those eyes that pierce at me, that go through my heart undone. As I begin to stare closely, those green eyes that make me wander. They seem to stare at my soul, that wants to cry out for her. But then an unhappy thought occurs, as those green eyes brush past me. The fear of thinking of those green eyes, never again will I be able to see.   This is one of my own poems that I wrote after graduating high school in 1996.  The green eyes belong to a girl that I had crush on all throughout the four years in high school!  I never told her though!

      Well, I found this online test on my friend Lesa's journal!  I figured I would share it with everybody!  But I'm sure you won't be that surprised to find out!   urlLink    Personality Test   Crispy, you're an Observer!   Your personality is actually determined by two personality sub-types — your primary, or dominant sub-type, and your secondary sub-type. You are an Observer which means you are a Discreet / Golden. Your primary sub-type is defined by "Discreet" characteristics and your secondary sub-type is defined by "Golden" characteristics.   That means you're even keel and don't care about drawing attention to yourself. Chances are you're more than willing to sit back and simply go with the flow. You're a born mediator and get along in most situations by relying on your unusually sensitive intuition.   How do we know all this? How do we know that you're probably not into serious soul searching? How could we have divined that at a party, you prefer to sit on the couch and watch the spectacle instead of being an active participant?  Because while you were taking the test, you answered four different types of questions — questions that measured confidence, apprehension, willingness to take risks, and your focus on experience versus appearance — the primary traits that determine your personality. Based on your responses, we determined your personality type, Observer.  And that's just scratching the surface.

      I'm at a bit of impass with a huge decision on my mind as of late!  I could use some suggestions or advice on this issue.  The issue is about having a home/apartment. Before and after graduating from college, my mindset was on moving up to Northern Virginia.  However, after living at home for the last few years since then, plans seem to fall through with living up to Northern Virginia.  It seems to me that the only reasons I want to move up to NoVa is that it is close to friends. Now that I have a job here near home, and knowing how hard it is to find what you really want in employment, I've given up on the idea of moving back to NoVa.  Now since I live at home with my folks, I am desperatly wanting to move out for so many reasons.  Now I could move out and in to apartment, but I find that it would be more financially better if I saved up to buy a home.  But to buy a house, I would need to save up financially and that means continually living at home!  I don't how much more I can keep my sanity while living with my parents! It was at dinner tonight that my mom actually came up with the idea of buying land and then eventually building a house!  But that means even more time to live at home with them.....to buy the land and then save money to build a house!  I think the best place to buy land around the area is in a county north of Charlottesville...and near where I work now.....in Greene County!  They suggested that I start looking for land there since the rates are so low now!   So what do I do????  Do I wait to buy land and/or a house.....as my sanity and patience slowly disappears while living with my folks?  Or would finding an apartment be easier but lose money from paying rent?    Any ideas or suggestions????

      Would anybody believe if I said I saw Sissy Spacek eating at Sbarros in the Charlottesville, Fashion Square Mall?  I've also meet Mare Winningham, Kenneth Star, and walked past George Welsh!

      I realize how futile it is to change the world.  Great men have tried to do so but once they leave us, the world is still the same! Generation after generation have done this with great cost and what have they to show for.....nothing! So that leads me to believe that we, as individuals, are insignificant as compared to the world.  However, it is there that lies our problem......what we are and what we see ourselves.  Mabye if we focused on how we can make ourselves better....to go beyond instinct and raw emotion, to go beyond fear, hatred, and ignorance....we can change.  Then if we change, the world changes with us!    I want to change!

      Its the first day of school here!  Nine months of watching the back of buses, stopping every couple of yards, and the traffic.  And the best part of it....you are always late for work!  Don't you just love the first day of school!

      In a meloncholy mood tonight!  My softball team lost it's double header tonight.....lost both games!  In the first game, I was the DH and only hit once.  In the second game, I came in the second half....but only to stay in out field for 2 outs.  The game was called on a mercy ruling....meaning that the other team had scored 15 runs in the game!   Also in an meloncholy mood because I am still waiting on a response from a woman that I have emailed twice from Match.com.  We emailed each other a couple times yesterday and I thought we had a lot in common!  She hasn't written back today!  I have been irritated with women these days!

       HOUR OF THE WOLF    I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the wolf. It is the time between the chimes of midnight,  and the first splinter of the morning sun. Silence and the cold night envelop me, as I am paralyzed between the dreamless slumber  and the fullness of an awakened consciousness.  I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the wolf. The shadows of the pale moon guide me,  along the still walls of my mortal existence. In the shroud of the calm darkness,  there lies the simple truth of our being, that our loneliness is our companion.  I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the wolf. I am aware the passing moments of time,  told only by the turning hands of a clock. Time slows to a standstill,  with every second it feels like an eternity,  as lifetimes pass beyond the flame.  I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the wolf. I struggle with every moment that passes,  for I lie between the cycle of life and death. Tick….tock…..tick…..tock, goes the clock tick…..one moment you are alive,  tock….the next moment you are dead.  I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the wolf. I sort through the past lives that I have once lived,  reliving those memories once thought forgotten. Images of lost loves and missed opportunities,  flicker like the flame of a candle, but are soon extinguished forever passing into the night.  I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the wolf. I soon move forward towards the unforeseen future,  of moments unknown and yet to come. My thoughts turn to personal dreams,  wishing and wanting to bring forth,  all that I desire from this life and beyond.  I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the wolf. My mind wanders in sweet ecstasy,  as I begin to drift back to a dazing slumber. My heart begins to beat slowly,  my eyes begin to close off to the night,  as I fall victim to the silent darkness.  I lie awake, alone, at the hour of the morning light. The wolf has passed into the dark,  silently howling into the night. Though the light of day has brought new hope,  I lie in fear of the continual presence,  of being awake and alone at the hour of the wolf.   Written by me....8/20/02

      I had a long and fun weekend!  Lot's to talk about....so bare with me!   THURSDAY   Thursday night was the first softball games that my team played.  It was a double header.  It didn't start off that well, when the first batter hit a liner to our shortstop, and the shortstop through it to our first baseman...her name is Lisa.  Well, it was so hard thrown that when Lisa tried to catch it, the ball hit her glove but slipped out and her right in the forehead.  She had to stand out of the rest of the game with a huge knot that swelled up on her forehead.  The other bad news was that we only had 4 women to start off with...and in softball, we need 5 women to play.  Because Lisa sat out, we automatically recieved an out when her turn came up to bat. Anyway it was a double header  as I said before.  In the first game, I went into play the first half of the game since we had to swap with the other guys so all of us can play.  I went 1 for 2 with single.  In the second game, I sat out the first half.  However, we were really getting our asses crushed.  In the second half of the second game, I finally went in.....but...it was tooo late.  The other team had scored 10 runs and therefore the mercy rule came into play.  I was on deck to hit when the hitter ahead of me hit our last out without scoring. Since we weren't able to score any runs, the game was called on that mercy ruling.  I was quite dissappointed!    FRIDAY   Well, the reason I came up to Northern Virginia this weekend was to attend the funeral of my friend's mom at Arlington National Cemetary.  It was suppose to be a eulogy at 9:00 at the chapel there and then the service at 1:30!  Well, it didn't start off that well!  I thought I was going to take 50 from Fairfax all the way to Arlington, but for some odd reason, I took the wrong route!  I ended up in Alexandria of all places.  I realize my mistake and finally found my way to Arlington.  When I arrived at Arlington, I didn't know where to go.  So I walked around around for awhile and I decided to ask a woman that worked with vistior service about the funeral.  She said she didn't but walked down to ask another who had the list of funerals at the Cemetery.  When she came back, she said that there was no funeral under the name that I was given!  I was so confused at that point.  She told me to go to the information desk and ask about it.  I arrived at the info desk and asked about the funeral again.  The teller also told me that there was no name for the funeral that I was looking for.  She then proceeded to show me to the office of funerals.  I go in and I see the secretery at the front desk.  I tell her what is going on and she tells me that the service was changed to the morning and I had just missed it!!  I was so dissappointed that I was not able to attend and to support my friend.  I later learned from my friend that they had moved up the time the night before and she didn't want to call me so late that night, which I was out playing softball.  I just wanted to say to my friend, Pat, that I am sorry about it and I know it wasn't your fault. Anyway, this brings up the debate I had later in day about getting a cell phone and why it's necessary.  However, I will leave that for another moment to discuss. So after learning the bad news, I drove back to Fairfax and wait to see what happened next.  I drove around Fairfax the next few hours waiting until my friend Ginger to get back home from work.  It just so happened that went into Barnes and Nobles that I ran into my friend, and one of the three Essex Goddess, Rachel working there!  I was surprised to see her that but was glad to talk to her.   Around 4, I left to go meet my friend Ginger at her place in Herndon.  She arrives a few minutes after me, sit and talk, and decide that her folks, her and I go out to eat.  We eat a nice Italian place called  Callabarras .  I had the wood grilled pizza, which was good but didn't think it was worth 10 bucks!!!  Oh well! So after we finished eating, Ginger and I decide to go and rent a movie.  As we get the car, she gets a call from her friend Jennifer, asking if we wanted to go to  Dave and Buster's  in Maryland.  When Ginger told me this, I was excited by the fact in going because I have never been.  I've been told that it is a Chucky Cheese's for adults.   So when we arrive at  Dave and Buster' , I meet Jennifer and her fiance David.  We first go into eat in the restaurant, and get to know the young couple.  They seemed to be opposites of each other, David being laid back and Jennifer being open and out there!  I had a good time talking to them.  During dinner, a magician came by our table and showed us some tricks.  It was quite a show that he put on....doing tricks as passing two rubber bands by each other and card tricks.  After he left, we couldn't stop talking about what he showed us.   After dinner, we went into the arcade part of  Dave and Buster's .  I was very impressed with what they had....video games, skee ball, and other little games to win tickets.  However, I was dissappointed in the way I had to play video games....using  a gard to get a game and I only play three games on one five dollar card!  Jennifer, David, and Ginger though played the other games to win tickets for prizes!  I think they collected over 8000 tickets, and with them collected a few prizes.   We left the place around 11 and decided to go to Fridays.  Apparently, one of their friends was having a birthday party and wanted to wish them that!  I didn't know anybody so I felt out of place!  We stayed for about 20 minutes, having Jennifer and David say hello to everybody, then Ginger and I left.  We then went back to her place, where I stayed the night.   SATURDAY   After waking up...for about a hour really....and getting dressed, Ginger and I decide to go eat and see a movie.  We went and saw  XXX , which stars Vin Diesel as a Xtreme sportstar turned Secret Agent.  All in all, it was an okay movie.  It had a lot of action and the corny but good one liners in it.  I would suggest waiting for in on video though! After the movie, we went back to Ginger's place, and I packed up my things and left for my friend Nick's apartment.  I got there around 4 and plan was to meet there at 7 with a few friends to go out bowling.  Nick and Sideburns (aka.. Steve) were at the apartment already since they lived there. Spiderman Dan...aka Dan....came in and I meet his friend Emily that was with them.  At that point, they turned to me about about a 2 part discussion they were having and actually wanted my insight!  The first, was my opinion on the movie  From Dusk till Dawn .  I told them that I liked it and one of the few vampire movies that I thought was good. The second part to the discussion was about if it was normal for guys to be attracted to their female friends.  My answer?  I said that it was normal for guys to be attracted to their "girl friends".   To be honest for me....I probably been attracted to all my "girl friends" at one point!  I hope this doesn't scare my "girl friends" away after reading this.  However, if you really know me, I haven't acted on those inhibitions and thoughts because I tend to move on from them....or the fact that I have only been seen as just a friend.  That's a whole other story that I won't get into. Anyway, Dan and Emily left a little later.  I was kind of curious to know what the story is those two.  However, I was told by Nick and Sideburns that it was topic of discussion that is not suppose to be discussed. Around 7, Sarah, the second of the three Essex goddesses, arrived with her boyfriend Colin.  They also brought Sarah's roommate Rachel, who was new to the area.  I'll be honest, I thought Rachel was absolutely gorgeous....and I especially liked her freckles!  Now for those that are reading this....ie. the ESSEX GODDESSES.....don't really pay attention to me after saying that!  What I say in this journal should stay here.....so there better not be any gossip about me the next time I come up.  Besides, there are many reasons why I don't I should persue her....which I'm sure you all would know more.  Actually the person who I think needs the help is Nick.....go help him out!  Anyway, I knew she wasn't really comfortable being there....being the new person in the group and the area.  I could tell she felt that because I know how it feels too!  I tried to get her to open up to us by asking her questions, but I don't think it really helped at the moment.   We then decided to go bowling, which I had a good time.  Rachel....the Essex Goddess.....came by later, which I was glad to see come.  I was disappointed that the third Essex Goddess, Kristina, wasn't able to attend!  But I'm not really angry at you if you are reading this.  Anyway I felt that we all had a good time bowling and I was hoping that Rachel....Sarah's roommate....was having a good time with us even though she wasn't bowling with us.  We had to finish after our second game when it was announced at 9:30 that Cosmic Bowling would begin! After finishing, we all went back to Nick's place.  There, while Colin played video games, Nick, Sideburns, Sarah, and roommate Rachel played Scrabble!  I just sat back and watched!  I was never good at playing Scrabble.  I was actually hoping to play Risk that night but no body really wanted to play!  They always played in college when I was there but I never had the chance to play with them but just once, and I had to leave early though!  Well, Rachel....the Essex Goddess...promised me that we would play next time I come up!   Things ended after one game of scrabble and Colin, Sarah, and both Rachel's left!  I stayed up with Nick and Sideburns in watching Drew Carey until they were too tired and went to bed.  That was it!   SUNDAY   Woke up early and left Nick's place to come home.  The trip takes about 2 hours to get home.  That's about it for now....we are having family over for dinner tonight.

      So I told a couple of people at work about my little story at the Mall and the beautiful girl!  After I told all of my co-workers the story, each one of them told me I should go back and talk to her!  I might do that....but I couldn't do it this week!  Meetings and softball the next two nights and I'm going up to Northern Virginia on Friday for a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.  I appreciate all my co-workers and my friends who support and try to push me in the direction of talking to the woman!  Actually, one of my co-workers said she might get me "hooked-up"....but who it that is I don't know!  I doubt anything will happen.  I don't carry much faith in what people say these days!  Anyway, if I decide to finally do something, I will tell you about it!!!  To Fanged Fem and "I'm Wierd" ....thanks for the comments and support.  I've been craving feedback for a while now.  Next time I see you two, I'll give you a big ole kiss!!!  Fanged Fem.....you know how to tease me, don't you???? ;)

       WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME?   So I go into town today to do some errands and shopping.  I decide not to shave because it is the only day I don't need to.  I shaved off my goatee yesterday so I look like my 12 year old self as usual.  So anyway I go into town, unshaven and I haven't ironed my clothes.  I look like crap! My first order of business is to get a hair cut!  So I do and I wait for an hour to get it done.  Next I go by Sam's Club and eat lunch.  YES....I ate lunch at Sam's Club....it has great pizza.  After I finish, I buy a couple of DVD's and leave.  I then go to the Mall and this is where I ask myself.... WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME?   I go into the Mall, and I am walking past one of those Jeweler's shops.  As I am passing it, there is a woman who is turned away from me and I am curious to see what she looks like.  Well, I got my wish!  Just as I was about to pass, she turns around and I am directly in front of her.  She see's me and I just stand there like a deer caught in headlights!!!  She is gorgeous.....long brunette hair, beautiful light green eyes, a face of an angel, dressed in a knee length black dress that shows off her curvaceous body!  I also notice she has a tongue stud as she begins to ask me something!  ;)    At that moment I knew she worked for the Jeweler shop beause she asked me if I wanted to buy something or get a credit card or credit for jewelery.  I don't know what it was!  I didn't really pay attention to what she said but I was still in shock that she actual spoke to me.  How could I....I was so nervous.  I finally said something...which I don't know if it made sense!  I think I said that I didn't have anybody to give jewerly to.  She then said that it doesn't matter, just so I sign up......which I still don't know what it was!!!  I didn't know what to say or do at this point other than babble something so incoherent that I could get away with some dignity.  I finally said....Well, let me come back and I'll think about.  She then proceded to give me those "Please, pppplllleeeassseee" eyes that have a sparkle in them and say that she needed this!  I then proceded to walk away!  After I walked away.....I realized how much of a dork I felt like!  I also realized that I haven't shaved so I must look like an escapee, I just had a haircut so I probably have tiny little hairs on me, and probably pizza breathe from eating before!  I just can't seem to win these days with impressing or meeting girls/women!  Well, I didn't return the same direction to run into her again.  I just went by on the other side hoping that she didn't see me!  In my head, I could hear myself say that WHAT A DORK!    I tell you, I just can't seem to win!  As another example, what's even worse, I can't even get a date through web personal ads.  I emailed three woman....two never replied back and one I think doesn't want to talk to me because I asked her if she knew my cousin.  Don't ask.....long story!  So I ask you, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME???  I would ask God that question but lately I beginning to think God is a woman and she is playing games with me!    So could anybody....ANYBODY....tell me what the hell is wrong with me?????  PLEASE?

      Last night I went to see  Signs  with my friend Kelly.  I thought it was pretty decent since it was directed and written M. Night Shamyalan (sorry for the misspelling!).  He directed  The Sixth Sense  and  Unbreakable .  If you seen both of those movies, you know that M. Night has an unusual way of telling his stories.  You would know he puts some strange twists and turns in his movies.  This one is no exception.  This movie takes a twist on the old alien invasion stories...by centering around a lone family.  It had it's funny parts and a few "jump out of your seat" moments.  I won't give any more away so you are going to have to see it for yourself!  I give it a C+ on my scale!

      Writing in this journal has been therapeutic for me.  It has allowed me to open up, to be able to talk more about myself more than I have before.  I don’t know if many people realized this but I don’t talk about myself much or open up as freely as most people do.  I hold back a lot of thoughts and emotions that I have towards others and myself around me.  I wish that people could know me more than they do.  My only reasoning for not opening up is that I was sheltered growing up and didn’t “live” as much as most do.  I was inward with my emotions and there were very few people that I felt I could talk to about them.  The subject of this entry is about me opening up and this is what I want to do.  I want to get something off my chest and this is the only way I could do it.  This month is the fourth anniversary of the suicide of my friend, Priscilla Sulieman.    What you have to realize about me is that I never really had anybody close to me die.  The closest thing was my grandfather when I was 7, but I was never close to him.  Up through high school, I was so sheltered and unaware of the world that I did not understand death of anybody close.  I meet Priscilla in my freshman year of college, in 1996.  She was only 16, being very intelligent rising past some grades in High School.  She was also very beautiful, being Middle Eastern and Caucasian blood, with long thick brown hair, olive skin, and big brown eyes.  I was thinking of asking her out but she was too young!  For the next two school years, I had a few classes and labs with her.  She always gave me a smile when I said hello.  I knew she would go far. But I never really hung out with her outside of class as much as in class….which I regretted.   It was in August of 1998 that I heard the news that changed my life.  Most of the people I knew from college, including Priscilla, lived in Northern Virginia, while I was here in Charlottesville for summer vacation.  I kept in contact with my friend Andy by email, who also knew Priscilla.  It was one day that I received news from Andy that Priscilla had committed suicide.  No one knew why she did it, and I never found out how she did it.  During this time, I was home alone while my parents were away on vacation.  I was so numb from the news and did not have anybody to turn to.  I was depressed all that week that I was alone….I did not know what to say or think.  This was the first person that I knew that had committed suicide.  When I came back to school a few weeks later, I asked around with the others on what happened.  No one knew why she did it and how she did it.  The school had a memorial service for her at a local church.  It was packed when I got there…so I had to stand at the entrance.  They had people who knew her best talk about her and prayers.  However, I never found out why she did it.  Since then, I wonder if I could have done something to change things.  I know it is naïve of me to think I could have changed things.  But I wonder if I was some how closer to her, could I have been enough of a friend to help her out.  This thought has plagued me since then.  I lie away at night, trying not to forget her… what she looked like, her smile, her laugh.  But then a morbid thought turns to what happened the day she killed herself.  I see her in her bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror, crying her eyes out, and then deciding to end it there.  I don’t know how she did it so I keep thinking of the many ways that you can kill yourself.  It haunts me at night when I try to sleep.  So much that I can’t help but weep sometimes that it puts me to sleep.  But I don’t want to forget her.  Since that time, I tried to make the effort to be involved with friends’ lives.  I want to be there for anyone who needs help.  However, I am conscience of a dilemma that I have made for myself… that is thinking of how much involved in my friend’s lives.  I don’t want to push myself into someone’s life because I feel that I would turn him or her off from being a friend.  On the only hand, I don’t want to just disappear from the scene and wait for someone to come to me.  I worry about being forgotten and then I would lose that friendship.  So it has been my solution to barely be visible to those that I have called friends, trying to not do so much or so little with them, by just sending the occasional email or joke to them, saying that I’m still here.  So here is my therapeutic remedy.  I do feel better opening up on this.  It has been weighing on my chest for the past few years.  For those that are reading this, I hope you understand the weight of my story and understand me more.  I know some of you have been in this same situation.  My advice is never forgetting those close to you.  Be there for them, for you never know when it will be the last time you see them.

      I just realize what one of my biggest pet peeve's is....when people tell me that I'm "out of the loop"!  Now I KNOW that I don't know what is going on most of the time with everybody, including friends....yes...it's called being "out of the loop"!  Yes...I like to KNOW what's going on with everybody but I know you are not just email or call me when something big or extrordinary happens in your life!  BUT....when people say it in a way that sounds like I'm suppose to know what's going on....it really pisses me off!  It makes it sound like I'm an invalid that has no clue what day it is!

      I had signed up for softball with my company, who are starting a team, a few weeks ago.  Last night was our first...and only....practice of it.  We have a co-ed...co-sex...whatever you call it with both guys and girls on the same team.  I thought I did fine...throwing, catching, and hitting!  But today, when I woke up, the only place that hurts right now is the back of my left thigh!  I'm wondering how did I hurt that part of my body???  Anyway, we have 10 games to play for this season and we start the week after next week.  If anybody would like to watch me make an ass out of myself....just come and watch!

       WE WON!   We finally won our second game!  Actually we only won because the other team had to forfeit.  They didn't have enough people to play tonight!  Well...we'll take them any way we can! We still decided to play a scrimage against them.  We did win but very close in the end.  I ended up hurting my leg again!  I still need that drink!  I think there is some Vodka some where in the house!  That's what my mom told me anyway!

      Someone asked me today why I post my journal online!  She said she couldn't understand why I would post my life for everyone to read!  EXACTLY!!!!  I want to post my life to everyone! I thought it was wierd too at first.  What got me started was a webcam site called Jennicam.com!  Jennicam was a site devoted to one young woman.....Jenni.....who ran webcams all over her place!  Let's just say.....I saw a lot!  However it let me inside the world of another person 24 hours a day!  Yes, you can say it's voyeurism!  But I thought it was a great idea!!! In the last year though, I found that some of my friends were popping up with their own journals online.  I decided to read them and I got hooked!  I couldn't help but read each entry, waiting and wanting to read more about what goes on in thier lives!  At some point, I decided to create one of my own!  Here are the reasons why I did so:  1.  It's a way to communicate my thoughts and ideas on certain subjects....like right now.  I'm not one that usually blurts out what I think or feel so this is much easier and it allows others to "put their two cents in"!  2.  It is much easier on here to get out how I feel, ie.....emotionally.  It is not easy for me to vent to someone in person than it is on here.  I tend to hold in my thoughts and emotions in. Sometimes I feel like I'm holding in too much anger and resentment and I have no form to release it.  I'm hoping from this that I can deal with telling what's on my mind up front to people then just turning around and leaving.  3.  I want people to get to know me.  I don't open up to people much or easily.  There are a few that I tend to relate to but not many.  And even those that I do open too, I still tend to keep a lot in.  I have a dark side that no one knows about!!!  4.  I was hoping from this that I can learn more from other people.  That is why I added the comments in.  I do enjoy having conversations and debates with others.  However, I'm still hoping for more imput!    5.  Believe it or not......I have a poor memory!!!  So those are my reasons.  I hope you understand what I have just tried to explain to you!  I'm not afraid to know that people are reading this.  Actually quite the opposite...I really enjoy it!   So.....there!

I dreamt I was in the Civil War fighting vampires inside a sand dune castle!!!  For the love of God, can someone please tell me what the HELL that means???  Alright...you can now laugh at me!!!

      Just another lazy Sunday!!!  Not much to do on a lazy day like this!  Actually, I came into town to watch my company play softball.  Our game that we were suppose to have was rain out and rescheduled for last Sunday.  That too was rained out and scheduled for today!  However, though I was not going to play today, since I wanted to rest my leg after pulling a muscle, it didn't matter much since when I got there, it started raining!!!!  We are never going to be playing this game!!!  Well, I don't think it matters since we SUCK!!!!  So after standing there at the field, with no one around, I went to Wally World (Wal-mart) to get a few things!  When I got there I got caught up in the idea of Halloween!  Actually my idea was to buy and bring candy to work and share with fellow co-workers.  It's good to brown nose!!!  While driving I had the wierd idea of using the candy to get to know my co-workers better.  I would tell them they could have a piece of candy only if they tell me something about them, a story, or even a joke!  We'll see how long that works!!!  Anyway, I have been thinking of a lot of other things lately, which would be too long right now to talk about!  I will save them for later!  Not much in the mood to talk now really!  Oh, just one last issue that I would like to present!  I'm glad to know that more and more people are curious about my journal and are reading it!  I would like to express my joy to those reading from LONGWOOD UNIVERSITY!  I'm happy to know that you are still in my life, even though neither of us cannot say the words!  You are always welcome in my kingdom!

       WILL THE INSANITY PLEASE STOP!   So, we lost again last night in softball!  We played 3WV, the local radio station here in Charlottesville, and lost 13 to 6!  What's worse is that I pulled a muscle in my leg!  It really hurts like hell now!  3WV was gloating this morning about the win on the radio!  I would also like to voice my anger this morning.  On the news this morning, they had a story about a mother who severely beat her daughter in the parking lot of a mall.  It was caught on camera and shown on the news this morning!  The story is that a mother and child went into a department store to get cash exchange on a purchase.  However, when the store did not allow the exchange, the mother stormed out with her kid to the parking lot.  As they got to her vehicle, she put the kid into the truck, looked around, and then started beating the kid horribly!  It was an outrage that a mother can do this!  And now they can't find either the mother or the child and they need to get the child to the hospital for a checkup!  Even my mom was downright pissed and she said she hoped they hang the b$%#h, which if you know my mom, she wouldn't say that even on her worst days!

       MY ADDICTION   I have an addiction that I don't like to talk about.  I haven't told anybody about this addiction of mine for the fear of being seen differently.....being mocked.....being laughed at and seen as an outcast!  I don't know why I do it but I just do it.  It scares the HELL out of me and I need help!  My addiction is...is...   I'm addicted to reading the wedding's and engagements section of the Sunday paper!  What?  Did you honestly believe that I would be an addict of something like alcohol or drugs!    I guess you don't know me that well as you thought! Anyway....it's an odd addiction.  Every Sunday I can't help but look at who is getting engaged or married!  I think this started when I saw that an old classmate....who happened to be a girl that I liked.....was engaged!  I keep wondering if I'm going to see someone that I know that is married!  It's actually quite morbid when you think about it.  When you see an ex that is about to get married, you can't help but wonder if it's true or not!  The heart drops and you are in a total state of disbelief.  It's a simple way to torture yourself!  Anyway...speaking of getting married, I know how women....or most women....like to think about their dream wedding!  It's a magical dream to organize that perfect wedding!  The guys, however, don't have anything much to do with it.  Actually it's the guys who have to first pop the question before the woman can plan that perfect wedding!  So the only thing that we guys have to think about is in what way do we pop the question to you!  We try to be original and/or romantic! Now you are probably asking where am I going with this?  Actually, after talking about this with a friend of mine today, I know how I will pop the question!!!!  I don't know if there is a rule that states you should tell people how you are doing but I will share with you on how I will do it!!! The first thing you have to ask is where?  The perfect place?  That would be Disney World!!!!  I know most women like to believe that they will find their Prince Charming or Knight in Shining Armor bit!  Well, where else can you find Prince Charming then at Disney and the Disney Castle!!!! So I would plan a trip down to Disney World with my future fiancee.  As we are walking down Main Street, I would ask someone to take our picture in front of the Disney Castle!  We would take a picture first and then I would then ask for another, so I can tell who is taking the picture what I'm about to do.  I then go back with my girlfriend, pertend to fumble something, and then get on my knee.  At this point I would tell her this:  "Would you let me be your Prince Charming in front of this magical kingdom for your hand in marriage?"  At that point, I would hopefully get a picture of me with my knee on the ground, looking up to my newly engaged...and crying...fiancee, with the Disney Castle in the background!  I know......it sounds cheesy!  But what the hay!!!  I'm a hopeless romantic!   NOW STOP CRYING!!!!!

       THE VIRTUE OF LONELINESS    I am the center of the universe but I am alone. I live within a world of solitude, a world of despair, a world of loneliness. Loneliness is my purgatory, my hell, and my prison. It makes me a hermit in seclusion in the lone mountain cave. It makes me the stranded sailor on the deserted island in the vast sea of society. I do not want to be in this prison of loneliness. It is the hands of fate that is made my warden and keeps me locked away. In the silence of the night before the twilight of sleep, my tears from loneliness fall upon my pillow. These tears are brought forth by the thought of my loneliness from the day, the day before, and the day before that and continue into the shadow of my past. I am a child without a friend, the lone child without anybody to play with on the playground. I am a teenager without companions, the lone teenager without anybody to go to a party or mall with. I am an adult without a soul mate, the lone adult without anybody to share his love and confession. It is the love from family that I do not fall into the abyss of my loneliness. It is their love, their strength, and their companionship that keep me alive at the loneliest times. However I seek more, I want more, to become more than the loneliness. To have someone to talk to in time need. Someone to have fun with, without the need to ask. Someone to be intimate with; to feel the physical pleasures of the body and mental wonders of the mind. I seek either a friend a friend or an intimate companion to be with, so I will not feel this deep urge of loneliness within myself. My only fear is that I will spend my whole life in this state of loneliness. I fear the feeling that I will live alone and die alone. The center of the universe is perhaps the loneliest place to be. The truth to life is to expect loneliness. In life, people come into it but you never get a chance to get to know them until they leave from your life. Family is the only part of life that does not leave. Loneliness is brought on by the expectation to keep a friendship forever. It is only in death that loneliness will not exist.   I dedicate this poem to all my single women friends out there!  I know how lonely it is to not have someone with you in your life.  No one to hold you when you are down, no one to rub your hair when your head in his/her lap, no one to say that three words to lighten up your day!  Its hard to be be alone and I should know....we all should know!   I should especially know......I was just told by the girl that I went on a date the other that she justs wants to be friends!  Those words make you cringe when you hear them.  I liked her but I guess I move on.  I don't like it.....I feel horrible....but I know that I can move on!  But I'm not going to lose hope or stop trying to find someone.

       MY DATE!   Well, I had a date last night, which has been a long time coming!  If you didn't hear about it, read the previous entry to know more! Anyway, it started around 8 when I meet Amanda at a local store.  She tried to tell me how to get to her house but I realized how futile it might have been to give me the directions after driving her back home.  We went to the downtown mall to go have dinner and a movie.  I didn't realize how crowded the Charlottesville Downtown Mall was on Friday nights!   We first stopped by "Christians", a pizza place right beside the movie theater to eat dinner.  After we finished, I bought the tickets to see  My Big Fat Greek Wedding , but we still had a hour to kill, which we did by having a varied conversation from family to doing unusal things to be rebel!!!   I thought the movie was great!  I was a true funny film as compared to current ones playing.  It is actually doing well for the amount it was made on!  It has been getting great reviews and that is why I wanted to see it! Anyway, after the film, we went outside to find that police were outside.  We walked down further to see a cop wiping the ground with blood on it.  We overheard someone say that someone had falling out of a third story window!  That is why I don't like to go down to the Downtown Mall. I then drove Amanda home.  This is where it got tricky!  She lives out in the middle of nowhere!  I was praying after I dropped her off that I could find my way back!  What was even worse was that I was almost running on empty!   Overall, I thought the date went great and I thought Amanda was great!  She loves to talk and have a conversation!  I was worried that I said to much to her throughout the date!  As you all may know.....or don't know for that fact.....I'm not very good on dating!  But I'm trying to do my best!  I'm just a late bloomer in this area!

       WE GOT SPANKED!!!   NOT LITERALLY!!!!  JUST METAPHORICALLY!!!  I guess no one really wished us luck last night!  Though we played a good game, we lost terribly!  Not only did we lose, but some of us, including yours truly, got hurt!  I happened to fall twice on my face!!!  The first time was after I got on base.  The women behind me hit an infield hit.  Once I saw that, I ran like Hell to second.  Of course when I got to base, I trip over it and landed on my face!  After I realized that I feel, I started to get up quickly to get back but was tagged!  I scraped up my knee and bruised my ego!!!   The second time I feel was when I was in the out field!  A ball was hit near my direction and I ran to block it and catch it.  Just as I was almost there.....I feel again!  I just don't what happened!!!!  I was just having a bad night! Well, the good news is I have a date tonight!  Yes...a date!  Her name is Amanda and I meet her through Match.com!  Actually it's funny, she happens to be a friend of one of my teammates and actually came to the last game that we played at Piedmont!  She came to last night's game to watch!  Afterwards, we talked for about an hour!  We are going out tonight.....SO WISH ME LUCK!!!!

       SEPTEMBER 12   I know....nothing really special about today!  I'm just glad that Sept. 11th has passed.  Though I do remember the events of Sept. 11th and hold it in my heart, this anniversery has just been overloading me will all the special events!  Overkill, I say!   Anyway, not much is going on.  I have a softball game tonight.  I know we are going to get slaughtered tonight, since we are playing the first place team in our division......and unbeaten!  Wish us luck anyway!

      So it's been a so so weekend in of sorts!  I decided to rent a couple movies this weekend,  Hart's War , which I thought wasn't very good, and  The Majestic , which I found to be more than I expected.  It stars Jim Carrey (as Peter Appleton/Luke), who plays a black listed writer in 1950's Hollywood, and the gorgeous Laurie Holden (Adelle), who plays Jim's love interest.  In the movie, Jim, who after is told he has been black listed, gets drunk, has a accident, and is swept out to sea.  The next day he wakes up on the beach with amnesia, so he doesn't know who he is.  He is found by a resident from a near by town and takes him to see a doctor.  After he gets into the near by town, people think that he is Luke, a MIA soldier lost in World War II (9 years ago) and the son of a local movie theater owner, which is called The Majestic. Over all I thought the movie was pretty good.  We all know that Jim Carrey as the outrageous, physical comedian in movies like  Ace Ventura  and  The Cable Guy , but has also played serious roles like that in  The Truman Show .  He tried to do a serious role in this movie too! There was one scene in the movie that I liked that was both romantic and funny!  When we first see Laurie Holden (Odelle), we learn her character had just gotten back from graduating from Law school, but also that she had a problem with hickup-ing when she was nervous!  Since Odelle and Luke were in love and both knew each other very well, it was thought that if Odelle showed Peter/Luke all the places that they both went to, it would jog Luke's memory!   One of the places that they went to was atop of a lighthouse as they were overlooking the sun light.  Odelle turns to Peter/Luke and says do you remember this place, but Luke doesn't.  So she tells him this is where they had their first kiss.  At this point the mood of both seems nervous, because of them rekindling romance,  and this is where Odelle starts to hickup!  Luke asks her is there a way to stop them and she proceeds to tell him that there was only one way that she knew how to stop it when she was with him.  As he begins to ask what, she grabs him and gives him a long embracing kiss.  She then pulls away and it actually stops the hickups! So in my book, I thought that was one of the most romantic scenes I have seen.  To think that some one could have an affect that on you is very romantic!  The only romantic thing I can think of in my live happened to me on Halloween in 1998, but that is whole different story that I'll leave for another time.  But don't you wish that you can emulate the movies when it comes to romance.  In the movies it seems so perfect and right!  So in other news that I can share, on Saturday night, my mom went to her 25th reunion for high school!  When they came back that night they told me what happened when they were coming back home.  On their way home, they hit a deer!  They were alright but a cop had to shoot the deer to keep it from suffering!  My mom then proceeded to tell me while they were waiting for the police and others who had stopped to help.  A couple of three older teenagers, two guys and girl, had stopped and helped them while waiting.  Apparently, they were from the area, Lake Monticello, in which I lived and they happened to know who my mom was since they have seen her walking with her cousin in the evenings.  My mom told me that she heard the girl turn to one of the guys who said who recognized my mom, and she yelled out "Hey, that's your girlfriend!!!"  Apparently the young guy had told his friends that he was enamored with my mom after seeing her walking at the Lake!  I didn't believe it when she told me either!!!  I thought she was just bullshitting me the story!  Well, a lot of people tend to think as my mom as being really young looking!  I don't know what that would make me!  Anyway, there is one thing that I do like to say in venting.  Has anybody noticed that networks are bringing back old cartoons that we grew up on!  I'm sure everyone knows about Transformers growing up.  They have a new cartoon on them now called "Transformers Armada".  Last night though, I just saw the new "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe" cartoon!  Is it me or are the networks and the people who make cartoons are just not coming up with any new ideas of their own.  Do they have to use or most cherished and loved cartoons that we grew up on and just tweak them for this new generation of children?  They just don't have the feel that I had for the old ones!!!  I'm just so disappointed right now!  I would really be outraged if they started to come out with new shows on "GI Joe".....or better yet...."Care Bears", "Strawberry Shortcake" and "My Little Pony".  Well, maybe not the last three but you get the idea...right?

      We lost again last night in softball!  The final score was 15 them and 9 us!  This makes us now 1 and 4 in the records!  I went 1 for 1 in the game and overall my average is 3 for 4, or .750 if you keep stats!  I have to admit though, it was a good game!  But who cares right?

      Ok, so I freely admit that I watched the finale of  American Idol  last night!  I never really got into the idea when it started.  I thought it was one of these God awful reality shows that have been coming out lately!  Honestly, I do watch  The Real World  (which I do know that it is not that real) and  Survivor !  But for every one reality show that I think is good, they have out three that I thought were terrible....ie.... Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire ,  Temptation Island , and most recently  Celebrity Boxing !  You have to wonder where are society is going when they make such quality programming these days!  Speaking of how our society is viewed, I can't help but remember my time down in the Bahamas a couple of years ago!  I went to Andros island, one of the island in the Bahamas, for a class trip!  They had only a few televisions there and all I saw on television was  The Jerry Springer Show ,  WWF , and constant news about Clinton and Monica affair!  When I was there, I couldn't help but think...."Is this how the Bahamians see Americans!"  But anyway, back to my point with  American Idol .  I thought that both Kelly and Justin sang beautifully and Kelly does deserve being the winner of it.  It seems to me tha the central theme of reality tv these days is to make celebrities from nobodies!  TV can offer you your 15 minutes of fame now!  I'm just wondering how far the networks will go to bring you your 15 minutes of fame.  Can Kelly last that long and will we remember this in 5,10, or 20 years?  So other news......well with me.  I'm still looking for personals on Match.com.  Not much luck......I'm getting fed up with waiting for women to respond.  I'm actually wondering if the picture that I have on my personal is scaring off the women.....I have my goatee and my face looks a little red!  Oh well, when it happens, it happens.....right?  I'm in no hurry.....welllllll....maybe a little.  Has everybody heard of Classmates.com.  You can look for old classmates from high school or college.  I decided to register on there but for 36 dollars a year, you have the ability to email other classmates and write a biography of yourself!  I thought about it myself.  Actually there happens to be someone I had a crush on for 4 years in High School, Brandy Jenkins, who is on there!  I heard that after she graduated from High School, she married her boyfriend and went to Californina.  However, recently, I heard that they got a divorce!  I might see what happens!  Tonight I have a softball game!  Wish me luck!

      You know that old saying...."You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family."  Well, I wish I could say I can pick my family.  I went to a family dinner over the weekend to celebrate my aunt and uncle's birthday!  We had a lot of family members to help in the festivities, including my second cousin, Shirley.  Shirley is a very conservative Christian, in her fifties, who likes to spout lines of Christan love to all her family.  She's the type that goes over to everybody to give them a big hug and kiss.  At first she may seem like the one who loves everybody.....but I saw a dark terrible side of her this weekend. A few of us were sitting around in the foray, including me, Shirley, my great Aunt Nanny, and my cousin Dee and her boyfriend.  Well, at one point, Dee asked me how my friend, Luis, was doing.  I told her that he was fine last I heard, and engaged to his boyfriend....yes, he is gay.  But you know it doesn't really matter to me....I love the guy, he's one of my best friends, and I'm happy for him.  Dee knows that my friend is gay but somehow Shirley overheard this.  It was at this point that I felt angry and appauled with Shirley.  She blatently yelled out that he is going to HELL!  I was so angry with her because of this outburst....and she has even meet him before.  She even said she liked him....everybody did when they meet him.  Even though I respect the opinions and lives of others, I just could not feel any sympathy for her or her beliefs.  It is my belief and opinion that everybody has the right and free will to believe in what they want, who they are, and what they do.  The only thing that really matters is that someone's free will should not alter or interfere with the free will of others. Just wait....there's more!  I start to say that Luis is one of the most spiritually blessed people I know and that he is Catholic.  Well, she had words to say about Catholics too.  She said that they were evil and are not true Christians and that they did some aweful atrocities!  I was continually appauled!!!!!  First of all, almost every culture, creed, and nationality have committed some sort of atrocity at some point...not just Catholics.  Secondly, I don't know if she realized this when saying that, but we were in the home of my cousin and her husband Bruno.....and Bruno is Catholic, and so are my family memebers on my dad's side, including my grandmother who Shirley has meet.  Shirley is on my mom's side of the family.   It hurt me deeply to hear this from her!  Now I should understand, and everybody who reads this, that my family is very narrow-minded and not open to many facet's of the world.  I understand that they are crude in their views and beliefs and I respect them for that.  However, when someone like Shirley blatent shouts out her bigoted views, it hurts me deeply.  I am open minded and I many types of friends......straight, gay, bi, white, black, asian, hispanic, Protestant, Catholic, Jew, Muslim, Wiccan, poor, rich.......and it all doesn't matter to me but their character! So, I feel I must apologize to my friend Luis for this.  I love you man and I am sorry that you have to hear this but I wanted to let you know.  And please don't judge my family.....not everyone believes what Shirley believes.  And to everyone else, I wanted you to know that I am not one to judge on belief and custom.  I judge by character and that's how should be in a perfect world.   But we all know that this is not a perfect world that we live in.

       The Second Date   I'm sure everybody's been wondering about a second date with the redhead Caitlin.  Well, last night was the second date.  Here's the synopsis:  Before meeting her, I had bought flowers to give her, since last week was her birthday.  I pretty sure she liked them since she said that they were pretty!  Anyway, we meet for dinner at 6 at the Italian restaurant,  Rococo's .  We talked about her weekend, her birthday, and upcoming plans for Halloween.  At some points, there was that dreaded silence where niether of us could find something to talk about!  But other than that, dinner was fine. After dinner, we went to see  Sweet Home Alabama .  Personally I thought it was better than expected.  My favorite line out of the movie is when Jake tells Melanie....."You never meet your soutmate at 10 years old.  Where's the fun in that."   Okay, I know....as a guy, I wasn't suppose to get into it....but I must say it's a very good saying!   Anyway, I have to say that I have no spark for Caitlin.  She's a beautiful redhead, very laidback, and sweet....but at this time, there is nothing there.  I hope to stay as friends, since I know I need more!   AS I usually say...."Whatever happens....happens."

       THE TORN SOUL    I lie in the shadows,  between the morally righteous and sinfully delighted. I am torn between virtue and temptation,  both equally unjust for the human soul. It is a choice to fall upon the sword in sacrifice,  or wield it upon the pitfall of human need. I call upon salvation to guide me, for I am the right hand of God, and left hand of the Devil. I call upon thee to guide me in the right direction, but I know I am damned in any path that I follow.

       CHILD OF THE 80'S   I was just watching the movie  Footloose , which I'm sure everyone has seen, and began thinking about the 80's.  Everybody knows the 80's were filled with corny movies, even cornier music, and the clothing and style....well, just think about afro's with those god awful striped gator shirts!  But I'm a child of the 80's and I enjoyed it....well from what I remember! Anyway, after watching  Footloose , I started thinking about all these web tests/survey's and thought about how I could tie the movie in with these tests/surveys that I see all the time.  I don't know if they have one on the web or if not, how I can create one, but here are some ideas that I had with comparing 80's movies with personalities!   Movie -------------------------------------------- Personality   Footloose--------------------------------------The Rebellious Leader  The Goonies-----------------------------------The Adventureous Follower  The Breakfast Club--------------------------The Outsider  Ferris Bueller----------------------------------The Popular One  Fast Times At  Ridgemont High------------------------------The Slacker  The Princess Bride--------------------------The Hopeless Romantic  Bull Durham------------------------------------The Jock  Flash Dance------------------------------------The Dreamer  Star Wars----------------------------------------The Nerd  Spaceballs---------------------------------------The Class Clown    Well, that's all the ideas I came up with.  If anybody has other ideas for 80's movies that fit personalities, or just wanted to change something that I have on the list, please tell me!

       SNEEZES AND ORGASMS   I read a lot of online journals and I found an interesting fact.  Even though I hate copying from other journals I just had to post it for everyone!     "they say that the brain cannot tell the difference between an orgasm and a sneeze - its our ability to think and reason that seperates the two and identifies them.  i'd like a lobotomy and a pepper shaker please.... "   You know it's actually funny if you think about it.  If anybody knows me......you know that I just don't sneeze.....I have sneezing fits!!!!  Not just one sneeze, not just two sneezes.....but many, in a row!!!    So does that mean I have multiple orgasms?   HELL YEAH!!!!

       LOVE FROM A WOMAN    The love from a woman, A power to admire, Second only to God, That man seeks to desire.  The love from a woman, That man has fought for, The desire for the power of love, Hides within the heart at its core.  The love from a woman, A force to reckon with, A power known by man,  Told through legend and myth.  The love from a woman, That man cannot control, A gift sought throughout the universe, But is only found in the soul.  The love from a woman, That makes men’s hearts weep, It becomes a double-edged sword, When it slashes a wound so deep.    Believe it, Breathe it, Taste it, Touch it, Live it.......just don't take it for granted.

       HALLOWEEN COSTUMES   I have the deilemma of finding something to wear for Halloween!  I've had a few ideas but don't know how to create them.  I went into the Mall the other day into the Halloween shop.  I found a costume for "Fat Bastard" (Austin Powers) that I thought was perfect.  However it is overpriced for 70 dollars!  Oh well!   Another idea that I had was after watching a newly found cartoon....Samurai Jack!  I don't think anybody knows who he is or what the hell I'm talking about.  It shouldn't be hard to find something like a while Japanese rope, with purple lining, and wooden sandels, RIGHT?  Oh, and I have to find an indestructable and magical samurai sword.  Anybody know where I can find one of those??? Anyway, those were the few ideas that I came up with.  I could just find something cheap to wear and call it a costume!  But where's the challenge in that!  What is everybody else doing and wearing?  I could use some ideas if you have any!

       MURPHY'S LAW   I'm sure everybody has heard this law before.  "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong".  Well, what I usually experience isn't that extreme but I tend to see it that way.  For me, anything that you plan.....will never become what it's suppose to be.  I call it "Crispy's Law"!  Usually every thing I try to plan never ends up the way I plan.  I plan a party but it never comes true.....I plan to go out somewhere but end up nowhere.......I plan a date, she ends up sick! Yes, I just got a call from Caitlin saying that she is sick and can not go out our date tonight.  I would say I'm disappointed but I would expect this to happen, so as it happens, I can't be really disappointed.  It's just that the paranoia comes out of me after something like this happens.  I start to think, is she really sick or just saying that so she can let me down easy!   Well, I say......FUCK IT!!!   I'm not going to let the paranoia get to me.  I'm not going to let the voices inside my head get to me.....damn....that is paranoia!!!  Oh well then!  There's going to be a party inside my head then!!!   CRISPY'S LAW   "Whatever happens...happens!"

       The Meeting!   I had a nice evening with Caitlin last night.  I meet her at Barnes N Nobles Cafe to start off with.  I really didn't know what she looked like but I knew she had red hair!  I know, not enough to go on but it worked.  I was actually waiting for her for about half an hour before the time we suppose to meet.  She came in, saw me sitting down, and said are you Chris?  So that was the easy part!   After the introduction, I asked her if she had eaten yet.  She said she hadn't so we went to Casella's, which is just a short walk from Barnes and Nobles.  After eating and talking for a while, we decided to go for ice cream at the local Ben n Jerry's.  After finishing, we walked back to Barnes and Nobles, talked for a little bit more, and watched some of the people around us. Anyway, I thought the evening was great.  She is very laid back and reserved....liked me.  She has been in Charlottesville for about a year now but doesn't go out much to meet people.  What you may call a home body!  We had a lot of the same interests....such as being home alot, we both like movies, and are close to family.   Physically, she is very beautiful, but what really turned me on was the freckles on her upper chest.  No...she didn't wear anything revealing....but her sweeter shirt had a small v-cut near her neck and I saw her upper chest near the neck.  That's where her freckles were!  Very cute and sexy I must say! Anyway, we made plans to go out Friday night for dinner and I suggested seeing "Red Dragon"!  I hope that theory about how relationships go as compared to the first movie seen together isn't right! Oh, I found out that her birthday is next week!  I might just send her flowers!    I like to acknowledge all my friends birthdays.  I remember one's friend's birthday is in two weeks!  Till then!

       The Nervous Meeting!   Well, I confirmed a puesdo-date for tomorrow night.  This is with Caitlin, the redhead that my supervisor Jason and his wife have set me up with to meet.  We are going to meet at Barnes "n" Nobles, to have coffee and talk.  The irony of that is I don't even drink coffee!!! I talked to her over the phone for a little bit last night!  She sounds very upbeat and nice!  She is a occupational therapist at UVa Hospital!  I also learned that over the past weekend, she got her certificate in gymnastics training!  OHHHHH....a gymnist!!  FLEXIBLE!!!!  hehehe!  Anyway, I am a bit nervous about meeting her!  I know I shouldn't be but I'm just am!  I want to thank the Essex Goddesses for their advice!  If anybody else has some advice, I'll greatly appreciate it!  Till then, wish me luck!   CARPE DIEM

       The Good Luck keeps coming!   Today....and the week so far....keeps getting better for me!  First of all, after having worked for three months at my new position at Autosport, I had to get a review.  It's good because I learned that I get a RAISE!!  Whoo Hooo!  More money to go towards saving up for a house!   Secondly, when I got home, my father showed me that he got tickets to the Virginia/Clemson game tomorrow!!!  I am just so excited with the luck I have been having!  I haven't been to a game in years!

       The Good Week!   It's actually turning out to be a interesting week for me so far!  I don't how know many of you know this but I placed my personal ad on Match.com and Yahoo Personals a long time ago.  I haven't really had much luck in the past months though.  I've meet and become friends with one woman.  However during this week, it has been picking up speed.  I saw a girl that I was interested on Monday, wrote to her, and now we have been emailing each other back and forth.  I've seen her picture and she is very cute!   At the same time, another girl wrote to me after seeing my ad on both the personal websites!  We also have been writing back to each other!  Though she didn't have a picture for me to see....I'm just exciting to meeting...in a sense....new people!   Actually the big kicker just came this morning!  I just got a call from my supervisor's wife saying that she wanted me to meet her friend!  I was so in shock!  I know that my supervisor was telling his wife about me and how everybody has been saying that they will try to hook me up!!!  I really didn't believe him when he told me about getting me set up with his wife's friend!  Anyway, she gave me her friends number to call, which I am going to do tonight probably!  Also the good thing about it is that she is a REDHEAD!!!  I love redheads! All in all though, I am trying to keep things in perspective.  I'm not really planning on dating anybody but I just want to see where things go!  I'm taking things in stride because if I don't, I know I will be the one to get hurt!    But it won't hurt to wish me luck! ;)

      For those of you who are not familiar with online journals, there is a site that allows me to see who reads my journal called SiteMeter.  Well, to be honest, it only shows me the domain that they log in under...such as aol.com, nexet.com, lwc.edu!  Sometimes I can guess who actually reads it but it's hard to narrow it down from those who use the big domains like AOL.  The site also allows me to see how the reader linked to my page....either through a link from a friends journal, a direct link, or even links from searches made from sites such as Yahoo.   With that point being made, I just wanted to say that I keep getting hits from people who search the name "Keri Wurher"!  Over a month a go, I saw  Eight Legged Freaks , which stars Keri Wurher, and I wrote about it my journal!  If you don't know who Keri Wurher is.....she is an actress who I like since she plays great characters that are both strong and beautiful.  Also it's not bad when she is a red head!!!  Anyway, from this journal, it links it to the search for her name!  I'm like greatly impressed with this!  I'm just wondering if they come back to read my journal any more! I also get links to my journal through my poems!  Actually one poem helped me find a website of someone that I haven't seen or talked to since I graduated from college.  Her name was Marian and I loved her website.  She even put my poems on the site to let everyone read for themselves.  So when I saw the link from the poem, I chased it back and found Marian's site that I haven't seen in over two years!!  Now it's good to know that I've begun to talk to her and she still has her site up!  What a world this internet is!  Anyway, I hope to see that more people read my journal.  I know I have a few return visitors but they won't say who they are!  I'm always glad for the visit!  Oh by the way.....Kelly....are you happy now!!!  I wrote something for you to read!  I'm hoping for a comment on my journal!

       The Old Times Revisited   I visited my friend Chris Robson last night when he came to town for this weekend!  I haven't seen Chris in over a year and a half and it was great to see him again!  We talked about the "The Good Ole Times".....were were only 3 years ago.....that we had in college and the people we remembered.  See Chris and I lived in the same dorm in our sophmore and junior year and were roommates in our senior year!  It's always funny when we talk about living together, especially when we were in the same dorm....."Essex"!  Boy, there were stories there in that dorm! Actually there was one story that got Chris riled and pissed!  It was our sophmore year living in Essex, and Chris lived down the hall from me.  We made friends with most of the other guys in the dorm so it became a close knit of friends, still even with a couple today.  But then there were a few guys that we remember that did some things that piss us off today.  One of these guys, who we named "Colonel"....don't know why he was called that.....but became known as the peeping tom of Essex! It was found out that Colonel was a peeping tom when another friend of ours found him taking out the peep holes in the doors and peeping on everyone.  It was realized when Colonel saw Chris and another friend of mine...who I say was Mrs "W".....in an intimate moment in his room!  I guess no one told Chris what the Colonel saw them doing!  It was spread around the hall what Chris and "W" were doing and I guess was correct because when I told Chris, he sat there in surprise when I told them that we knew what he and "W" were doing!  He was so in shock when he heard this and didn't realize that he and "W" were being watched!  For the rest of the night he kept saying "Oh my god, I can't believe he did that.....and everybody knew what we and "W" did"!!!  It was so funny to know that he didn't even know this happened! So I always enjoy going back to my college days!  I miss them so much!  But it was great to have a friend of mine visit!  It was much needed!

      Just when you thought t.v was safe, they made a show out of the B-movie, urlLink Tremors .  Now if you saw these movies, you know it's one of the best B-movies made!!!  Giant worms that attack you from beneath the ground, then can change into smaller creatures that see by body heat!!!  I know they are sappy but I can't help but like them!  The first Tremors movie starred Kevin Bacon!  One of his better films I must say!!!  HEHE!  I have it on DVD, and I always watch it when it comes on television....usually every couple of weeks!  Call me crazy but I like the movies......I just hope I like the tv show!!!

       Home Search   I found a home the other day in Charlottesville and went by to check it out this morning!  I must say, even though it could use a lot of touch ups, it's very nice!  I know I would have to do some definite work on the outside, and though I haven't been inside, I see it might need it to inside.  But my folks told me that they would help get it in shape if I do decide to buy it.  Anyway that is drawbacks of being a home owner!  By the way, for those that do know of Charlottesville, it's over on the other side of the Downtown Mall.  It's not that bad of a neighborhood where's it's located.  But if I do buy it and fix it up.....there will be a party at my house!!!!!

       Harry Potter vs Wizard of Oz!   You know the last few years, we have all been hearing about how Harry Potter has influenced the minds of young children into becoming witches and wizards.  It's teaching them to follow the teachings of Wicca, or what might most people call witches, or more outright called Paganism!  Many Christian leaders preach against the books and movies that are made of this young wizard because they feel it will drive them away from fundamental christian beliefs.  Now I respect their beliefs but that doesn't mean I have to agree with this one.  It's actually very funny and hypocritical if you ask me!  You know why?  Because if they have to look at the influence "Harry Potter" has on children....then how come they aren't focusing Disney, the fairy tales, and even looking at one of the greatest movies ever made.... WIZARD OF OZ . I focus on Wizard of Oz to make my point that it has the fantasy world of Oz, the witches, and flying monkeys!  How come no one argues about that?  Because it was in our grandparents time and look how well they turned out!  As for Disney....does anybody find it unusal that we tend to worship a giant mouse!!!!  He...well Disney....had his hands into almost everything in all our lives!  Our parents were the first to be so called "brainwashed" by this guy and see how well they turned out!  Well, actually, if anybody knows my father knows that he loves Disney and wants to move down there.  But he still turned out to be well rounded and sane!!! Anyway my point is that "Harry Potter" is only a cultural phase for children.  They are young and amazed by the adventures of this young lad.  It gives them something to look towards to in these times of terrorism, even though they don't understand it.  As I look at it, our grandparents had "Wizard of Oz", our parents had Disney, our generation grew up on Saturday morning cartoons.....we all turned out fine.  Let this generation have Harry Potter, because when they do grown up, see what kind of world they have to live in!

       The Hieny-Lick Maneuver   Well, it sounds like a joke.....but I have both a scary and funny story that involves the Hiemlich......or the more creative maneuver...Hieny-Lick! Well, it started last weekend when I went up to my aunt's house to spend the night with my mom up there with them!  We all sat down to dinner with spaghetti and salad.  My mom had just sat down beside me and was eating her salad.  Suddenly, she starts coughing and choking.  I'm sitting there in shock not whether to believe she is just softly coughing or just plain choking!  I was in shock!  Finally after a few seconds, my cousin's husband, Bruno, understand what was going on and took her to the bathroom and gave her the Hiemlich manuever!  He did it and she finally got the piece of cucumber that was stuck in her throat!  However, that whole night we just had to laugh about it because a few of us at the table were just in shock about it and didn't know what to do! Anyway, my parents went to church without me yesterday and when they came home, mom preceeds to tell me a funny story of what happened at Sam's Club.  While they were in there, my father was eating jelly beans when he started to cough roughly.  He said that he just wanted to get some water to wash it down!  However, my mom sprung into action before realizing if he was really choking or coughing.  She tells me she threw down her purse and her bags she was holding, went behind his back, and wrapped her arms around him in a bear hug postion, and started to do the "Hiemlich"!  It's funny because if you have seen my parents, father is about a foot taller than my mom in comparison!  Also just to see this is funny enough but when my mom tried to renact this, she was hilarious!  She couldn't stop laughing at it.  And when I asked my father about it....all he could say was that he just wanted to get some water to wash it down!   Anyway.....thank god she didn't do the "Hieny Lick" manuever!!!

       The Long Weekend!   Well, it's that time of year again!!!  Time for the Christmas decorations to come down from the attic!  Every year, I would help my father get the tons of christmas decorations down from the attic and then help my mom set them up!  Usually, throughout this process, there would be a lot of shouting and grumbling, and the occasionally cuss word here and there!  I HATE IT!!! But this year was different!  We usually put up the Christmas decorations up after Thanksgiving!  This time we put it up before the holiday!  Also this time, my mom's sister and cousin can over to help her set of the decorations!  All my dad and I had to do was bring the decorations down from the attic and put the empty boxes back up afterwards. So on Saturday, while they were setting up the decorations, my father helped me look for homes and land.  Actually, after looking at one of the houses outside the lake, we had a little accident.  Nothing major but it did scare me!  While we were driving down a hill, the road was slippery, we spun out of control and hit the guardrail!  We just scraped along it, but didn't do much damage to the truck!   I asked if we were going to tell mom about this and he told me a blunt "NO"!!! Well, after that we drove from Fluvanna, to Louisa, up to Greene and Orange.  All the houses we looked at were either too expensive or just down right trashy!  I'm even looking into buying land and then build a house.  However, that is also as hard to find! Anyway, I just got back the pictures of Halloween and my costume.  I will pass along the picture once I find a way to post it in my journal or just email!

      I just wanted to share the good news that I got.  My friend Pat, who is about 3 months pregnant, sent me the sonogram pictures of the baby!  It's a wonderful sight I must say!  I would like to say how I am happy for her and Patrick!  I hope all goes well with them and the baby.  Also, I've also been looking into buying a new home!  It's a very hard search!  I'm looking to buy something in the neighboring counties of Greene and Madison....just north of Charlottesville.  However, with my finance's....I'm looking for something less than 90 thousand....which I know is extremely hard to do for something that is decent!  Well, I keep looking until something shows up...eventually!

       IT'S A LONG WEEK!   It's been a long week for me so far!  I've been battling a flu/cold since Saturday....which is what I don't know and I don't really care!  This whole week, it's been a roller coaster in feeling good and then bad, and then good and bad again!  Actually I'm feeling better today....just a bit tired.  My Supervisor, Jason, went to Las Vegas this week for some automotive product show out there.  I want to go to Vegas some day!  My friend Jennifer eloped there last year, and my parents went there for their 25th wedding anniversery!  It's funny, I watch  The Real World , which is in Las Vegas at the moment.  Man, talk about the sin that goes on there!  I know some day I go there, but not the reasons you think!  I might go and elope there!!!  Lately, I've been buying up so many DVD's lately.  Yesterday, I bought  Spiderman  and  Babylon 5: Season 1 .  I have over 100 dvd's in my collection now!  I'm getting some more soon because my aunt works at Technicolor.....which is moving out of Charlottesville.....and she can get me dvd's at a very cheap price.  She brought over a list that they had the other night and my parents and I all went over the movies that we wanted to buy for Christmas.  I bought five dvd's right away, but I made a list of movies that my mom is getting for me for both my birthday and Christmas!  I know, it takes the fun out of the mystery when you do that.  But when they are at the low price of 8 dollars a piece, who could pass that up!!!  If I remember correctly, there was another 15 that I'm going to get from her, and other members of my family from that lists as gifts!   However, the dvd's are not going to stop there!!!!  I'm going to buy  Star Wars: Episode 2  next week when it comes out,  The Lord of the Rings: The Extended Version  which I already have one copy but it's just the one that came out a month ago.  I'm also getting  Star Trek: The Next Generation  seasons 5, 6, and 7 when they come out and I'm going to buy the  Back to the Future  Trilogy when it comes out later this year.  I know I'm going to spend or have spent over 500 dollars on all these....but it's worth it!!!    I've also beening keeping up with old friends and new ones!  I miss my friends up in Northern Virginia, including the Essex Goddesses!  I've noticed though that they have been having problems though. I hope it's nothing serious!  That's what I hate about being so far away from them.....I really feel like I can't be a friend to them.  I'm also glad to know that I am making a new friend, Laura Cruz, who is friends with one of the Essex Goddesses, Rachel.  I told Rachel any friend of hers is a friend of mine.  I hope that the other Essex Goddesses think that too.  I'm just in so much of a mood to meet new people lately. I've also been meeting and making new friends through journals.  There are two that I like to know about....they are Janeblog and Ms. Morgan!  I've been reading Janeblog through a link on a friends Journal!  What's funny is that Jane....or Katie, which is her name....actually lives here in Charlottesville.  She seems to be of an intellectual at UVa here, but seems really cool when I'm reading her journal.  The other...MsMorgan.....aka SeXyLiPs I presume....seems to live on the West Coast.  However, I don't mind making friends from the other coast.  Kind of puts a damper on meeting her though!  We'll have to see what happens!

       WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE!   "A Minnonite female driving a Dodge Viper with a big black guy in the passenger seat!"  That was the story that my co-worker told me.  She said she saw this when she went up on Skyline Drive this weekend!  I couldn't believe the story myself!  It's just so funny to think a Minnonite was doing this.  If you aren't sure what a Minnonite....they are like the Amish but they do believe in using Technology.  They look and seem so simple if you knew what they look like.  The women wear their simple blue and pink dresses with the white cap on their head.  You know what I was talking about if you saw them!  They also tend to be close to other Minnonites and not outside of that culture!  Well, that's what I heard anyway!  I don't know if it's completely true!  So can you actually picture that in your head????

       New Year's Eve Poem    Today is New Year’s Eve,  the last day of the year. Let’s all go out and celebrate,  with alcohol and beer.  We begin to say to ourselves,  “Thank God the year is over!” Soon a new year will come,  let’s hope I’m not sober!  People start crowd into the streets,  all ages from young to the old. They all start to think one thing,  “Damn! My ass is cold!”  We look forward to a brand new year,  as the stroke of midnight sounds. We start by making our resolutions,  let’s hope we lose those extra pounds.  I tell myself that for this coming year,   I will finally find my soulmate! However, I don’t think it’s a good start,  when you throw up on your date!  Let us ring in the New Year,  keep the alcoholic beverage pouring! I know I will wake up late,  with a damn hangover in the morning!  So I wish you a Happy New Year,  let’s hope 2003 is not a waste! It won’t be since you will be working hard,  at losing the 3 inches off your waist!

       Out with the old, In with the new!   Well, I figured I might add in some question and answer time on here!  Here some questions that I wanted to pass along.  I'd like to see everybody do this too!   1. What was your biggest accomplishment in 2002?   My biggest accomplishment in 2002 was finally getting a real job that I enjoyed and didn't involve rude customers and poop!  The last year and a half, after finishing college, I went from working in the ticket office at Monticello to working at the SPCA and back to Monticello to working several different positions there!  It was on Jan. 2nd of 2002 that I started working for Autosport.  I started as a lonely "administrative assistant" but got a promotion in the middle of the year to Dropship Data Specialist and making more money!   2.  What are your goals for 2003?   Well, right now, I'm focusing on my biggest goal which is building my own house!  I'm the process of getting a loan, completeing the paper work, and looking into designs for a house!  Other than that, my goals are to lose weight and get fit because I might go to Hawaii next Thanksgiving with my folks!  Also, I like to find that special someone this year so I can take them with me when I go to Hawaii!   3.  What was your biggest disappointment of 2002?   Well, for me, it was the death of my great uncle Bob.  When he died, my parents took it hard!  They went up to see him in Massachusetts every couple weeks until his death in April!   Also, I also have to say that I'm disappointed that I haven't found a long term realtionship this year.  I did date a few women, who are still very special to me, but I didn't feel that it was long term!  It is also true about friendships.  I made a few more friends this year but I wish I could have made more.  I didn't push myself to meet more people or hang around my old friends more!   4.  Is there anything that you are going to miss about 2002?  Are there memories about that year that makes it special?   Actually I will remember 2002 alot.  I did get more experience from relationships this year though they weren't as long as I wanted them to be.  I hope I can gain more experience in 2003.   5.  Do you have a New Year's resolution?   I actually have a few of them.  One is trying to lose weight and be more healthy.  Hopefully I can lose at least 20 pounds before I go to Hawaii next year!  Secondly, I want to be less aloof, or in other words, not as distant or reserved as I normally am.  I want to open up more to my friends and be more of a friend to them.  I want to meet more people and make new friends!

       Future Wish List   I was looking through the internet to check out what I want to put on my wish list for 2003 Christmas list.  I found this  urlLink link  on the Lego's: Star Wars website.  It's animation of several scenes from each of the Star War's movies.  But here's the kicker....they use lego's in place of the animation!  It' s pretty cool so check it out!  I know, I know...I'm a bit old to be playing with Lego's but I don't care!!!!  I LOVE THEM!!!!

       Post Christmas Spirit   I am personally glad to have Christmas over and done with this year!  It just seems at times too materialistic these days.  Most of us spend more time and money for just one day instead of celebrating the joy of having family and friendship everyday.  I know it sounds sappy but I feel it’s true.  I have to honestly say that it is harder for me to get to really enjoy Christmas because my birthday is the day before Christmas.  It’s true what they say…I do get ripped off…but not in the way that you think.  I don’t really care about getting presents that are meant for both my birthday and Christmas.  No….what I do really care about is the acknowledgment that I get for my birthday in the shadow of Christmas.  I often get ripped off because it’s been the case that people will forget my birthday in the spirit  of the Christmas rush.  All I need….all I want.....is a simple card, an email, or just a simple phone call that just says those few words....the acknowledgement that makes me happy and joyous.  All I need and all I want is just to be remembered by those that I cared about. In so being that I do not want to feel this way, these last few years I have wanted to be as I have wanted in my quest to give acknowledgement.  It’s the golden rule of caring really…..if you want to be remembered, then you have to remember yourself for others needs.  I have tried to think about other’s birthdays, to send maybe a simple card, or an email, or just a phone call to both my family and friends to say that I am remembering them on their birthday.  I may not make a difference because they may have already had their family, friends, and significant others give them that birthday message, but I hope to make some contribution of remembrance even if they don’t even reciprocate.  I tried to do my best, to remember everyone’s birthday. Still, not everyone remembers.  Even though most of the people I know acknowledged my birthday in some form or another, there are a few friends and even family that forget or do even acknowledge all together.  It especially hurts when it’s someone close to you.  My grandmother did not acknowledge my birthday this year, nor even the last few years.  I can say it’s because she is getting old and doesn’t remember, but I learned from my mom that my grandmother doesn’t even acknowledge her own daughter’s birthday!  I may understand but it still hurts.  All you want for your birthday is that one person to say those few words that makes your day bright, yet when it does not come, you feel alone and unwanted.  That explains why I may take the time to acknowledge a friend or family member’s birthday.   So in turn, when that person’s birthday what do you do?  It is very easy to just not acknowledge their birthday, to not even send a card, write an email, or just call.  Why should you take the time to do so when they didn’t have the decency to say just those few words.  Just give up on them, let it go, don’t do anything with them....that’s the golden rule right.  I know how easy it is to give up on someone, even if you care about them so much it hurts.  You want to hurt them, or even worse, just ignore them.  I know because I’ve done it before.  It’s easy to do so.  But in the end, I finally realize as I get older, that course of action does not make it easier to do or make you any happier.  If you keep doing that, you end up hurting yourself because you lose that person that you may care or love, even though they might not feel the same.  You lose your own heart and spirit in the long run and life becomes a pit of quicksand of depression and sorrow.  So these last few years, through the high’s and low’s that I have experienced in my 25 years of life, I’ve tried to make the decision of doing what I feel is right, though it may not have the results that I want.  I know I carry away a piece of each person that I meet, have known, and care for and I have hoped they have done the same.  I doing so, I have tried to acknowledge that love and caring by doing little things for those that I call my friends and family.  I know by sending a card for Christmas or calling on a birthday may seem simple but it always the simples things that make life what it is.  I will continue doing things such as sending cards on birthdays and Christmas to those I care for, though it may not be reciprocated, but I don’t mind.  However, I am still going to acknowledge the birthday’s of all my friends and family, because I care enough to do so.  I choose to do so!

But I'm getting off from work at 1 today to go to Richmond this afternoon!  My uncle is having my dad's family over tonight!  God help me! A special thanks to Ginger for sending me the gift!  Right off the bat I knew the character was from the Rudolph clay-animation Christmas show!  Very cute!  However, I'm still having troubling linking to your journal! Also, another special thanks and hugs go to Jodie!  Thank you so much for the Star Trek Calander and the movie gift certificate!

       25 Years!   I keep thinking about becoming 25 years old coming up in the next few days.  It's a pretty weird age if you think about it.  You think, oh my, you will be a quarter of a century old!  Not really impressive I must say when you think about it.  At 25 years old you can rent a car!  Whoop-de-doooo....rent a car!  Does anybody know why you have to be 25 to rent a car?  They say at 25, your car insurance goes down.  That doesn't seem to be true with me since I called about it the other day and they say that rates are going up anyway!  Dammit! At 25, you start to think, "Oh my god, my twenties are half over and I'm half way to being 30"!  This actually bugs me because I'm seeing too many of my friends getting married and having children and I'm still looking for that long term relationship.  I'm not actually looking to get married and have children yet but it does seem to come to mind when I see so many people my age are at it!  The only thing I can really say is that my longest relationship was five months.  Pretty scary!  Anyway....I'm turning 25....AND I NEED A HUG!!!!  Will someone get me drunk so I don't have to think about this shit?

       The Two Towers!   I saw  The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  today!  What a great and awesome movie!  I have to give credit to Peter Jackson for making this series!  I can't wait to see the third one!  My favorite part was the battle of Helm's Deep.  The march of the evil army of Orlacs just makes you terrified by them!  Just a great battle scene!  Oh, just one piece of advice....Never go to Wal-mart during the last days before Christmas!  Packed in like sardines, everyone pushing you, and nobody is looking out where they are going.  That's one of the things I hate about Christmas!   Only 3 More Days!

       Pie and Vodka!   Coming into work today I didn't really expect to get presents or cards.  However, Dana, one of my co-workers baked several pies for a few people.  She happen to give me a chocolate pie!  Darryl, the Vender Information Survisor, gave me a book on Tim Allen yesterday!  Also, Kim, my supervisor who runs the Merchendising department, gave us alcohol!!!  I happen to get Vodka!!!  This would be a good time to get drunk for the first time!!!!   Only 4 More Days!

       Survivor and more Christmas Cards   I watched the finale of Survivor tonight.  Brain, the Used Car Salesman, won it all!  I was quite surprised too!  Actually I found out he was actually a B-porn star at one time and that is why I think he won.  He's an actor, and you have to fool people to win on Survivor!  I think his wife is actually a B-porn star too.  Don't ask me why I know this!!! I would like to send  a big thanks to my friend Amanda for sending me a card!  Thank you!  Also, I big, BIG thanks to my friend Kelly, Queen of NASCAR, for sending me not only a birthday card, but getting me something that I love......a gift certificate for a movie ticket!!!  WHOOO HOOO!  Kelly, you are such a sweetie and I will be giving you a big hug for that when I see you next time!    ONLY 5 MORE DAYS!

       Holiday Wishes from Friends   I just wanted to share an e-mail that I got from a dear friend.  I just wanted to share it with everybody!   Best Holiday Wishes to All...   don't take friendship or love for granted.... you can never truly know a person well enough as you think.  all you can do is accept the gift of friendship, with its' amazing depth and complexity.  hopefully it exists as a two way street where the most important exchange, of feelings, not really favors or gifts, is returned  in thought, that you're friends have expressed receiving something from you, as a person, as you choose to share with them.  sometimes it's as if you are so comfortable with each other in one instance, and in the next situation, you are a stranger to them. embrace the gift for what it is, and be well...   I couldnt' have said it better really!  I know it's hard to be a friend sometimes.  Sometimes I think that I haven't been a good friend, or a great friend, or even a best friend to some.  I don't know if if I try to hard or don't try hard enough sometimes.  But the only hope is that I can be friend and I hope they feel the same way.    May all of you who read this be safe and happy during this holiday season!   Only Six More Days!

       Live Long and Prosper   Okay, I'll be the first one to tell you that I am a big Star Trek fan.  Though I love it, I'm not a fanantic about it like most people.  I haven't been to a convention yet nor have I dressed up as a character or alien from it!  Yet, I still love watching it (the television shows and the movies) and I love the ideals it represents! With that introduction, I just wanted to say that I went to see the new film,  Star Trek: Nemesis .  I have to say though that I was quite disappointed in it.  Don't get me wrong, I would still go and see it again because it is Star Trek.  However, I felt the movie was a big downer.    WARNING:  SPOILER AHEAD!  I felt that the whole plot of the movie was just too cheesy and underdeveloped.  The clone idea was a good idea but how they portrayed the villian seemed two-dimensional.  Now, take Khan, who I felt was the best villian of all the movies, now there was a villian!  You understood his story, his anquish, his rage against Kirk.  He was a perfect mirror for Kirk.  However, with Shinzon, trying to emulate the same thing with Kirk/Khan, didn't do it justice with Picard.  I mean, the guy is angry at humans because he was cloned from one.  It was the Romulans that cloned him and put him in a deep dark mine forever!  Yet he is still angry at Picard and humans!  I just don't feel it from him! Another part of the film that just didn't help it was the dialogue!  I remember one seen after Enterprise had just rammed the enemy ship, they had problems with the transporters.  Picard decides to beam over to stop Shinzon and La Forge tells him that he doesn't know if he can beam him back.  Right after Picard beams over, the consoles explode, and La Forge just turns to the crew and says in a monotounous tone, "Well, that's it".  Pretty dramatic I must say as they all turn to look at the enemy ship thinking about Picard! And lastly, I just didn't feel it with the death scene of Data.  Over the past year, I heard rumors that Data was going to be the one to die in this so I guess I wasn't really surprised to find out when it happen.  It's just how the scene comes to Data destroying the ship and himself seems so unrealistic.  It also didn't have the same feeling as when Spock died in  Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan . In that movie, the death of Spock seemed so real and unanticipated.  It was a complete shock to everyone and hit deep at the heart.  Everybody thought: He's gone, oh my.  I can't believe it.  But with Nemesis, it didn't seem as emotional with Data because you know he has a replacement with his prototype, B4.   Like I said, I was just disappointed in this movie.  I don't know if they will make more....I really hope they do.  I just hope that they can write a better movie than this.   ONE MORE WEEK!!!!

       My trip to Harrisonburg and Christmas Cards!   So I went to Harrisonburg today to check out some Log Cabins!  Yes, I said Log Cabins!  I'm planning on building a Log Cabin when I start building a house.  I really found some nice designs!  It's hard to decide on what I want.  Well, I still have a few months to go before I have to decide on a final design anyway.  Before going to Harrisonburg, we first went to a lumber company that makes wood for log cabins.  You know how that is exciting....when you check out wood!  Well, it's one of those things you have to do in the long process of building a home!  I got a letter from my friend Chau today!  I'm so happy to hear from her!  She's is the type that won't reach and talk to someone, if you know what I mean!  So what, it's still good to hear from her!  She also sent me a pen from the CIA!!  It's probably got a bug in it!!!  HEHEHEHE!  I also got a Christmas card from my wonderful friend,  urlLink FangedFem , the Queen of the Dark Arts and Models!  It's always a pleasure to hear from you!  I hope everything is going well with you!  I hear that you are in love again which I am greatly happy for you!  ;)

       Being an adult!   So yesterday I went by the bank to discuss with them on buying land and building a new house!  The current plan is to buy my uncle's trailer and the couple of acres that he owns.  The land is beautiful, located about 20 minutes from the town of Crozet!  My father is really helping me out by going to the bank, looking at designs, and drawing up the paper work.  Yesterday was the first step in getting things started.  But to tell you the truth.....I'm scared to death about this.   The reason being is that this is the prime example of what being an adult is.  To move on, to make those hard decisions, not knowing what can come.  You have to ask yourself..."Is this the right thing to do?"  I've been asking that for the last two years, ever since I graduated from college.  I thought I knew what I was going to do afterwards but plans change and you have to go into a different direction to accomplish your goals!  I honestly didnt' know what I was going to do after college.  The only thing I wanted to do was to stay in Northern Virginia to be around friends and get that job that I had no clue what I wanted.  I didn't think I would be coming back home and having to rely on my parents for the last two years!  But now, with building a home, comes that point of actually realizing that I am an adult.  I don't have my own family to raise but it's a possiblity in the near future.  It doesn't mean I have to stay in the area for the rest of my life but I'm starting to build a home of my own.  It's pretty damn scary for sure!  That's what adults have to go through though.....those hard decisions and going through the consequences on your actions. I have to honest also that there was another adult decision that I made just recently.  For the past six weeks, I have been dating a co-worker.  Now that may not seem as tragic or controversial as you may think, but the truth of the matter is that she is 31, recently seperated, and has three kids!  It's a very complicated subject but I'm not going into detail about it for now.  I never expected to date this woman but it happened.  We seem to have a connection and I...well, WE....wanted to see it where it would lead us.  The truth is that when we faced the certainty of our relationship, she had more feelings for me that I had for her.  I didn't know if I could ever have those same feelings for her as she does for me, though I did care for her!   So over the weekend, we ended the relatioinship, which was extremely difficult to do, even as an adult.   I hold a secret that I feel I should tell you right now.  I have a written journal that I keep that I write in for other moments of my life that I don't want to share with the world.  I decided on the first page of this journal that I would write the names of every person that has effected me during my life, both in good and bad experiences.  It's a way to help me remember things, events, and those special to me for I worry that I would forget them as time passed on....as I grew older as an adult.  I don't want to forget but I don't want to lose both the pain and the passion that I have kept inside.  I have a strange empathy for those that I feel have had an impact in my life and I don't want to lose that.  So I have decided to write another name down in my journal, because she has had an impace in my life for which I never want to forget.   "I lie silently in the shadows of the world, torn between the morally righteous and the sinfully delighted."     ONLY 12 MORE DAYS!

      Did you ever have one of those days where you just wanted to go nuts and do things that you were told not to do in the past?  Like me, being at work right now, I have this urge to run around the office with scissors!  Not the most professional thing to do...since I'm sure it would get me fired!!!  I guess I'm just restless, having to be stuck indoors because of the cold and snow!  Actually now that I think about it, I've asked myself "Have I done anything crazy like running with scissors"?  I don't know that answer because I really can't remember!      ONLY TWO MORE WEEKS!!!!

       The Winter Wonderland!   So I made it into work today just fine.  My father had to drive from Fluvanna all the way out to Albermarle past the Airport.  Except for some spots, the roads seemed fine.  I have to say that thought that some people who think that they have 4WD and SUV's and can drive really fast on slick roads.....ARE DUMBASSES!!!  That's all I have to say about that!   Well, hopefully, I can get outside today and have a snowball fight with some of my co-workers today!  I hope everyone is warm and snug on this cold day!

       My Virginia Cavaliers!   Ok, even though I'm not really big into sports, I do have strong tendencies to support the Virginia Cavaliers....since they are located where I live!  Right now I'm really disappointed in the way their football team has been treated!  They started off slow but finished 2nd in the ACC standings!!!  2ND (They should be since they beat Maryland)!!!!  That should count for something when Bowl bids come around, right???  BUT NO!!!!  It's a slap in the face to them when they are 2nd place and the teams, which they beat this season (nationally ranked Maryland, NC State, and even Clemson, which are all good teams) and still get passed by those in charge of selecting teams to go to Bowl games!  Virginia should be going to the Peach Bowl or the Tangerine Bowl, but lower teams are going before them!  It's all because the people in charge of selecting the bowls want coverage and they feel that the Cav's don't bring alot of coverage!!  This is what the standings are!!!  ACC Conf All  Florida St (18) 7-1 9-4  Maryland (19) 6-2 10-3  Virginia 6-2 8-5  No Carolina St (17) 5-3 10-3  Clemson 4-4 7-5  Georgia Tech 4-4 7-5  Wake Forest 3-5 6-6  North Carolina 1-7 3-9  Duke 0-8 2-10    IT'S A DAMN OUTRAGE!!!!  The Cav's deserve better!!!

      I found this quote while reading another  urlLink online journal .     You ever get the feeling that reading people's online journals is like cheating? Like you can't be damned to get to know them better? I do sometimes.   Very fitting and ironic to me as of late.  Seems to be a one way street though for some people!

      Always heed the advice of your mother when she says "Be careful when you leave.  It's icy out there"!  Well, I didn't heed it.  As I was walking out the front door and down the porch, on the first step, I slipped!  The whole damn porch steps were icy!  Well, sufficite to say, I bruised my ass and my ego!  I hope I'm not walking funny later tonight since I have a date.

      I just had the biggest urge to search the internet under  urlLink Google , a search engine, under the names of everybody I know.  It's actually quite strange and facinating on what you find under a person's name.  I tried searching under the names of some of the people I know or knew to see if they had some type of information on them, whether it be a personal website on them, to some useless fact about them, or to just seeing their name in a sponsered marathon in which they came in 43rd for that race!  I would trying searching for someone you know because you never know what you may come with!

      I know some of you out there are eagerly awaiting to hear about my exciting life, especially my totally exciting weekend!  Here it is.  On Saturday, I went up to Fredericksburg to meet Chris again about plans for a log cabin.  He gave us a quote of two of the plans that I had.  The cheapest one was 25 thousand for a kit, which isn't too bad.  However, you have to realize that it also another 25 thousand for building costs, and added that with the 32 thousand for my loan on the land I'm buying, it brings the total up to over 80 thousand.  I'm trying to keep the loan between 80 to 90 thousand because that's all I can afford on the loan and mortgage payments.  I couldn't really understand what the HELL the guy talked about....that's why I'm glad I had my parents with me to tell me in english what it meant.  I don't know if I'll fully understand how everything works by the end of it!  On Sunday, I went up to see my Mom's family.  They were throwing a birthday party for my cousin Dee, who turned 25.  It was the usual birthday party, dinner at 3:30, dessert, and opening of presents.  I don't know why but I seemed to be the only guy there watching my cousin open up her presents, which included two pairs of bra and thongs!  YES, I was there, watching them open up this, and I should worried that I didn't get uncomfortable.  Actually I'm quite use to it because most of them have a weird kind of sexual humor to them.  Trust me!  Came home later that night to watch the Super Bowl.  I was more excited to watch the commercials than the game itself.  Actually I didn't catch them because by 9, I was watching High School Reunion on the WB channel.    Anyway, right now I see people on AIM that I haven't talked to in a while or just surprised to see them on.  However, I don't want to talk to them at the moment.  I don't think they really don't give a damn any more if they want to talk to me.  Hell, if they are reading this, they don't need to talk to me.....they just have to read my exciting life to date!

      I found out that my uncle Willie had a stroke, or what looked like a stroke, yesterday.  I didn't get all the details because when I came home, my mom went to see him in the hospital and my father was at home when he was told.  It wasn't until around 10, in which my mom got home, in which she told us that he had stroke-like symptoms, one them being that he was numb on one side.  She said he was doing fine when she left the hospital, before he had a MRI done.  He's the same uncle that is selling me his property, which I'm not really worried about, but my mom told me that they are still planning to go through with selling the property.

       Dreamcatcher   I had the wierdest dream last night!  I dreamt that I was stuck on a deserted island with all my ex's and girls I dated!  You know you think this would start out as a fantasy but it was far from it!  All of my girls/women just totally ignored me and when ever I try to come over to interact with them, they laugh at me and run me off to the other side of the island!  They we are, the girls on one end, creating a community for themselves and me on the other end, becoming a lonely and wild creature!  I would hear them partying at nights, chanting "Kill, kill, kill", and I was wondering if they were referring to me!  Then one day, I see them, dressed like Amazon women, painted up with war paint, carrying spears.  They start racing over to me with their war call and I'm trying to get away.  As I'm about to be caught, I get knocked out.  When I awaken, I'm tied to a pole over a fire, while they are asking themselves..."White or Dark meat?"  Now how fucked up of a dream is that???  Now I can tell you that my worst fear would be to be stuck on island alone, but to have those I dated hate me enough to ignore me and then kill/eat me!  Now, I know some of my ex's and some women I have dated read this, so I have to ask this.... DO YOU REALLY HATE ME THAT MUCH????

       Thought of the Day!    There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra than Alzheimers research. This means that by 2020, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.   I received this thought from an email.  Just thought it was way too funny not to share!

       Trip to Northern Virginia   It seemed like I traveled all over the Northern Virginia/Washington D.C. area this weekend!  It began when I arrived at my friend,  urlLink Ginger's , house in Herndon.  After having dinner with her family, we went over to her friends house in Fairfax.  After  urlLink Meghan  arrived, we started off a fun filled night with picking out several board games to play!  I'm serious...it was fun!  We first started with the game called Baulderdash, in which Meghan won, then went on to play Life, which Meghan won also.  After finishing that, we played Parchisi, which I won!  Now that was an exciting game....everybody just about a heart attack with that.  We finished up the night playing Head of the Class.  That was more difficult than I expected!!!  After finishing around 2, Ginger and I went back to her home.  The next morning, we went for breakfast.  At the resteraunt, we meet Ginger's friend, Heather!  After finishing up breakfast, we decided to go to Washington D.C., first to check out the International Spy Museum, but decided not to go after seeing the block long line outside of it.  We did get to see the many...many protesters that we up there protest the coming war with Iraq!  After going through traffic, we went to Georgetown.  While there, Heather took us to a couple of sex shops!! Yes, sex shops!  We first went into a S&M clothing shop and we looked around the leather clothing and outfits.  We then went to  urlLink The Pleasure Place .   WARNING, The following is an adult link .....I warned you!!!!  Anyway, it seemed to have everything imaginable!!!  To be honest, I was neither excited or bothered by what they had there, but I thought it was cool and interesting. I would say for everyone's pleasure!  However, I didn't buy anything!  After that, we went back to Herndon.  After getting back to Herndon, I packed my stuff and headed off to Fairfax to see my friends Nick, Sideburns, and Spiderman Dan.  After arriving at their place, I go in to see them, I am suddenly jumped on by Nick....I think he was happy to know I was there!!!  Unfortunetly, his sudden and surprising weight cause me to fall down and break the coffee table in the living room!  That happened to be the most lively hello I have ever gotten before!!! After mourning over the table...a couple of seconds I think....we headed out to Wendy's for food and came back.  Around 7, my friend Rachel came over to visit and hang out.  We then headed out to dinner...well just her....to a Chinese restuarant.  After finishing, we went by to see my friend Chris working a book store in the same mall.  Since he was busy, we went to our friend, Q's townhouse.  We stayed and watched the movie  Go .  When Chris got there, who also lived in the town house, we decided to visit Chris's friend's place.  After staying there, not know what to do, for an hour, Nick, Rachel and I came back to Nick's place. During the drive back, we were talking about buying/building a house.  The conversation came up because I am in the process of building of house myself.  During the conversation, Nick proceeds to say that building a house is scary and that it would mean that my life is over!!!  OVER!!!  I don't think my life is over, is it!!!  It's not like I'm going to get married or have kids.....that doesn't mean that life is over either!!!  But to think that life is over because you have the responsibility of owning a home is rediculius!   MY LIFE IS NOT OVER!!!!  Anyway, that was my weekend!  A bit boring but I long needed this trip up to Northern Virginia!

       Sleepless nostalgia   I woke up last night in the hour of the wolf.....what I call the hours between 2 and 4.  It's that time when you lie in between waking up and sleeping, not really knowing which way to go.  I can tell you, it's a very lonely at that time.  It's hard to go back to sleep so your mind wanders off.  Last night, my mind wandering back to nostalgia, to past moments of my life.  It's not a good thing really.  Lately, every time I get nostalgia, it becomes sickening for me.  I tend to focus on so many missed opportunities, so many moments, that I had in the past and begin to wonder how I could have changed them.  Regrets...that what they are.  If you begin to dwelve on them too long, it seems to poison both mind and soul. Too many regrets made....not enough said or haven't said. I tend to push them down but I know someday they will only explode into something darker and huanting.   At this point, there is an urgancy for me to apologize to some for hurting them.  I seek redemption from those few in the only way I know how.  I want you to know that I'm sorry for hurting you.

       Snow Days!   I hear it might snow this Thursday and Friday.  God I hope not!  I was planning on going up to Northern Virginia this weekend to see all my friends up there, for which I haven't seen in six months!  I especially want to see my friend Pat...she's around 5 months pregnant.  That's actually been going around lately.  My friend Jennifer...aka Frankie....is 7 months pregnant.  It kind of puts a perspective on things when you are dealing with life.  I know most people from High School are either married, have kids, or both.  Even some I've heard are already divorced!  I guess you start thinking about these things when you reach the ripe old age of 25!    I'm really in need of an epiphany!  How about a revealation or manifestation of somesort?  No...then how about a clue!  That's all I ask for!!  If you have one, can I borrow it?

       Loans and Cleaning   My bank called yesterday to tell me that I can get the loan on buying my uncle's trailer and land.  However, to my disappointment it was a bit less than I hope for.  The bank offered to give me the loan for 80 percent of the appriased value of my uncles land and then I would have to pay the 20 percent as a down payment.  Let's just say that the amount that it is needed for my down payment is six thousand more than I have!   However, when I got home last evening, my parents had a talk with me.  They told me that if I could get another 1000 with what I have in the next month, which I'm sure I could since I just got a raise, they would lend me the five thousand with that.  Let's just I was overjoyed with this news!  But now the real fun begins with getting everything in order!  My folks are warning me that I'm going to get many headaches!  But in a year hopefully, I'll have my own house.  Anyway, last night, after that, I just relaxed on the couch watching the season premiere of  Farscape  and  Stargate: SG1 .  While I was watching the shows, my cat Tink comes down to lay down on me and sleeps on my chest the whole time.  Actually watching these shows, I noticed Tink was just flat out passed out!  When I picked up her head, it was limp and at first I though she was dead!  However, when I went to pick up, she woke up crying!  Whew...I was glad to know she didn't die on me!  She must have been dead tired.....excuse the pun!  This morning I helped clean up the house.  I spent the morning cleaning the bathrooms (not the best job in the world), mopping the kitchen and bathroom floors, and the task of cleaning between the tiles near the front door foyer with a toothbrush!  We found later that we have a new house coming up beside us and they were clearing the land.  We sudden found out that while they were clearing the land, they cut the cable that was in the ground and we could not watch cable!!!  We sufficite to say we survived but my father wasn't able to watch the basketball game this morning!  HOwever, it has now been fixed and we can now watch tv!!!

       urlLink   High School....again!   I was watching a show on the WB channel tonight called  High School Reunion .  What it does is that on the 10 year reunion of the class of 92, it brings forth a bunch of people from that class to see how things...or if things...have changed in 10 years, let these people stay for two weeks in a mansion in Hawaii, and see what happens to them.  I have to say it's an interesting concept really.  I know in High School, I was the shy, quiet, nerd/loner!  It seemed like they took every person that had the stereotypical role that one would have in H.S., such as the jock, the cheerleader, the unattainable girl, and the nerd.  The question is, would if had a certain role in high school, would you be the same 10 years later?   I ask that about me....have I changed since high school?  I will be coming up on my 10 year reunion in another 3 years.  I tend to believe that I have gotten far from my image that I portrayed in high school after going through college.  I may tend to be the shy and quiet type when it comes to meeting new people but I tend to warm up to them.  Also finding out other classmates have or have not changed is another thing.  Now because I still live in the same area, the same house, since high school, I tend to run into a few old classmates now and again.  I have also took the step of signing on to  urlLink Classmates.com , a site where you can see other classmates in high school and college.  I've already email several people that I found on there that I went to high school with.  Some have replied back, but I'm still curious to see if others will.  Actually there is one person on there that I had a huge crush on all throughout high school but never really told her.   She was the prom queen, and the last I heard was that she married the prom king, went with him to California, but a few years ago heard that they divorced.  I'm starting to think that I could get a second chance.  But the question, has those people changed or stayed the same?     Question:  What were you in high school and do you believe you changed?

       "Reality" TV?   Is anybody else worried about the state of reality tv?  Take for example, "The Real World", on MTV.  I think it was this show that made reality tv what it is today.  You take 7 real strangers and film them 24/7.  However, it's only a 30 minute show once a week that depicts the torrid affairs and triangles of these people and draws them out like a soap opera.  I admit freely that I watch this show!  In watching the new season, which is located in Las Vegas.  Is it me or are the people on this show a bunch of wild horn dogs?  One girl is....or was....having sex with one roommate but is showing in next weeks episode that she is going after another roommate.  They even talk about this girl coming close to being pregnant by the first roommate!  Now two other roommates are going at it while one one them has an open relationship with her boyfriend!  Now is this what you call the "Real" world...because if it is, then I shouldn't even be in it!!!  Also, the other "reality" show that I can't help but notice is "Joe Millionaire"!  When it first showed previews for it, about a man having to select one girl from 20, I thought to myself, are they running out of ideas.  Then the kicker came.....the show told these women that the guy that they were going after had 50 million dollars.  However, in truth, the guy is a construction worker that only makes less than 20 thousand.  My first thought to this was this is getting really cruel!  The boundries have been crossed and tv is going into territory that is just evil!  I would think how would the woman that this guy pick feel about being fooled on national television and made a mockery of her!  I would be devestated by this conclusion! However, I truly think this is very very fair!  I think it's a great idea once I began to think about it.  After shows like "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire", I was thinking that women just went into this for one thing....MONEY!  I mean I have to believe that these women who go out for these shows are a bunch of golddiggers who only marry for money!  So this show, "Joe Millionaire" is perfect for showing what...not all....women want.......to marry a rich man!  How will the last woman react when she finds out this guy is not rich?  Are her feelings for him just as strong as the desire for money?  I can't wait to see.

       Women in the Military?   Today at work, eating lunch in the break room, I was listening to four women, including my friend Jodie, talk about why women should not be in the military or even president.  They agreed on some aspects of having a woman as president, most believing that a woman would be too emotional.  One of the women said that if a woman was president, during "her time" on 9-11, it would be all over.  I didn't say anything because I had four women around me at the time so I was in "enemy" territory!!!  But as for the fact as to if a woman ever being president and what she might do is still remains to be seen. As for women in the military, I agreed with with Jodie when she believed that women should NOT be military in fighting.  Oh, don't get me wrong...I'm all for women having that choice to be in the armed forces and fighting for their country.  However, it's the aspect of women fighting in battle that I don't agree with.  The reason that was said was that they are not as physical strong as men....which I believe is true.  Also, we have gotten use to seeing men die in battle but it's far more different than seeing women die.  However, in my view, women should not go into battle because women are our most needed natural resource.  What that means is that women can have children, men cannot.  Hell, you don't even need a man for a woman to have a child these days.....you just need our sperm!!!  You can freeze it and thaw it and use it the way you like and you don't need without the natural mess of men!!!  So in battle you can replenish an army with new beings....but the only drawback is that it takes over 10 years for that!

       Willie Wonka   Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was on t.v tonight!  I have to tell you the truth, that movie scared me as a kid.  Hell, it still scares me!!!  Especially the boat ride!!!  Yall remember that.....as they are going through the dark tunnel on the boat, all those strange images coming up, with Willie Wonka doing that singing/chanting!  Gee's....that scared the hell out of me as a kid!  But now, as an adult...well, supposedly an adult....I watch it over and over and see what's wrong with that movie!  What scares me now is that if you notice as the Umpa Loompas, as they work with the food and candy,  THEY AREN'T WEARING HAIR NETS!!!!  Seriously....that's a serious health code violation!!  If I was a health inspector, I would have closed that plant down and thrown all those Umpa Loompas back where they come from, whatever the hell that is!!!  No more song and dance for those annoying little orange people!!!

       I'm a day tripper!   I went up to Fredericksburg today to check on some log cabin kits.  We went to see a guy, also named Chris, about the kits he sells from this company and took a tour of the house that was built.  We then went over the plans that I liked.  I think I found one....well, actually a modified plan....one that my father was able to cut and paste!  It would be about a 1000 sq. ft. with two bedrooms and one bath, and I'm planning on putting in a basement!  I'm really excited about it!  However, I'm still waiting on to see if I can get the loan to buy my uncles land first!  I don't get word from the bank about that until this Thursday!  After that, well, it goes all up hill! After talking to the guy, we went over to Lowe's to check out what I can get for my limited budget....loan!  Actually, I swear, I think my mom is more pysched about this then me.  She was going through Lowe's trying to point out things that I will need.  I will decide on what I want to get but I'm going to make her my personal Interior Decorator.  The truth is I don't have an eye out for what color tile goes with what base board or kitchen cabinet.  It's that male defiency of determining what color difference is!   So the truth is ladies.....we men really do need you to help us pick out colors!!!!  We are really lost without you!

       Happy New Years!   I actually had a decent time last night.  We had a party at my house, my parents had invited all the neighbors over.  At first I was my recluse self but I just decided that this night I wanted to change and be socialable.  I have some pretty weird neighbors really after talking to them!  However the highlight of the night....and I know this is going to shock some people...but I had some alcohol!!!!  Yup, I tried a White Russian....well, took a couple of small sips....and two shots of Vodka!  The person that made these for me....my father of all people!!!  Let's just say that everybody at the party were quite surprised that I was drinking!    Well, I hope this is the start of a pretty good year for me!

      Just came from sledding with a few people behind the company building that I work for.  I don't think there was anyway to get into trouble because my supervisor, the Merchandising Director, and the Vice President of Marketing suggested it!  Even the President of the company came out and watched us!!!  I haven't been sledding in a long time!  IT was fffffuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnn!!!!

      So I made it into work today, even though it seems like half of Charlottesville doesn't have to be.  Both my folks are off today, but I felt bad because my father had to drive me into work today, since my car is getting a state inspection.  He has to stay in town all day because of me.  Why can't I just get a government job and stay home when the weather gets bad like this???   As for the weather, I hope it doesn't get any worse.  My cousin Dee was going to throw a birthday party for her four year daughter, Courtney, this Saturday.  However, she believes she may have to cancel it.  She was expecting to have it at a local skating ring....rollar skating that is.  God knows every time I put on rollar skates, I immediately fall on my ass everytime.  Because of that fact, I was not planning on going to the party.  However, Courtney is such the cutest kid!  My mom actually took her to the SPCA on Wednesday after asking what Courtney wanted to do for her birthday.  Mom told me that she had no fear whatsoever there and just put her hand in every cage to pet all the dogs.  Mom has always been deathly afraid of dogs, so I'm sure she had alot of anxiety when Courtney touched the dogs.   Anyway, I will actually be moving near them this year, once my house is finished being built.  It will be strange to be living within a one mile radius of my mom's family.  I guess I should start remembering all my cousin's names that live there.  I'm serious when I say I meet a new cousin every time I go see them.  Well, it's still snowing!!!  God, make it stop!!!!

       Death, Laughter, and Insanity   It's a sad day in the neigborhood!  An American television icon,  urlLink Mr. Rogers , died recently.  Even if we didn't watch him, we know who was and that song, "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood...".  We grew up watching him and Sesame Street and Captain Kangaroo, and they tried to teach us what was right.  I wonder when...if....we have children, will they have someone like him teaching them what is right and wrong.    Anyway, switching the subject, has anybody been watching the show, urlLink "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here" !  It's a total laugh, but not because it's funny to watch, but because the name of show is completely hysterical!  In the show, they have "supposed" celebrities camp in the rainforest of Austrialia, do some wierd trials of endurance, and have the country call and pick who wins to be King/Queen of the Jungle for charity.  I laugh at it only because who is a Celebrity on there!!!  All they are are a bunch of washed up has-beens or unknown wannabe's!  I'm sure everybody knows who Robin Leech is....he had a show called "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous".  But that was in the 80's.....how is a celebrity now.  There's "Downtown" Julie Brown, known only for her work on MTV when it first came out in the early 80's.  Then there are people like Cris Judd....who's only claim to fame was that he married, and may I remind you for a only a short time, to Jennifer Lopez!  Also there is Melissa Rivers, who is only doing this so she can probably get out of her mother's shadow, Joan Rivers.  This show is just bad...like so many reality shows nowadays!  They need to rename it "I'm a wannabe celebrity, please watch us"!  Also.....I want to add.... I'M SO F&#KING SICK OF THE SNOW!!!!   How long till spring begins?

       Movie whore learning HTML   Yes, quite a title for this entry I must say, but quite true.  I saw Daredevil last night.  I thought it was okay.  It doesn't compare to Spiderman though.  I don't know if I can picture Ben Afflack as a vigilante superhero type.  I'm sure he can pass for the hunky romantic comedian.  I liked him in all the Kevin Smith movies such as Dogma and Chasing Amy.  Speaking of Kevin Smith, aka Silent Bob, he had a scene in the movie.  However, it was so short of a scene, I wanted to see more of Kevin Smith.  I also thought they should have had more of Micheal Clarke Duncan, as Kingpin.  He makes a great villian.  However, I thought the most redeming part was Colin Farrell, who plays Bullseye.  I didn't care for much of the Recruit, which he was in, but I think he is....and will be...a great actor. Today, I went to see Chicago.  I have to say that I liked it.  I'm sure many of you know it's based on a musical.  After seeing this movie, I really want to see the play.  There aren't many musicals that I like.  The last one I saw was Moulin Rouge, which I thought was terrible.  The music wasn't too terribly bad....the only song piece that I liked was when the Argintinian guy started singing "Roxanne" in that bass voice of his.  However, for Chicago, I thought the musical numbers were awesome.  All of them, especially with Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zelwigger (please excuse the spelling) were just so sexy and hypnotic with their singing.  Anyway, I would like to go the muscial play version of Chicago someday. After the movie, I finally decided to buy a book on HTML.  I've been wanting to tweak my journal a bit by adding links to other journals.  I know a few people that can help me with this but I want to learn on my own.  I'm sure if I can learn enough, I can create my own webpage.  I was thinking of a title for it already.  How does this sound....."The Magical World of Crispy".  Sounds too Disney doesn't it? Well, it's been raining all day.  I was worried that our basement would flood from all this snow and rain.  Actually while driving into town, much of the area was flooding.  I was hoping that I wouldn't get washed away and disappear on my way home.  But where's the fun in that?

       Good news, Good news, and Etiquette   Last night, I recieved an email from my friend Pat, who is 7 months pregnant.  She wanted to share the good news that they found out that she is having a boy and they found a name for him!  I wanted to congradualate her on the good news.  But it doesn't end there!  My friend, Frankie, who is also 7 months pregnant, sent me an email about her progress.  Actually she sent a picture of her showing off her belly!!!  She said she had gained 20 pounds and thought she looked terrible!  But I didn't think so and so I sent her back an email saying that she looked gorgeous!  I am extremely happy for both these two young women!  Also, I wanted to write about the etiquette of writing a journal.  As my friend Meghan pointed out in a comment in my last journal, she said, " ...rules of etiquette change when posting your journal in a public forum. ".  I like to say Meghan does make a valid point.  Yes, I should have kept a level composure to my writing as a part to decent etiquette to a public forum.  I'm sure like all other public mediums for free speech, proper etiquette is involved, such as message boards and public debates.  These public forums are in control by the hands of many individuals that decide what can be said and what can be viewed.  However, I must state the point that forums that are runned by a single individual have the control of the etiquette that is involved.  Are there proper rules of etiquette for an individual that writes in his/her own journal, a medium that I might add is also controlled by the individual.  If the medium was run by the public, they can easily block or delete material that is not of proper etiquette of an individuals material or comment, which is decided by several individuals or company.  With an individually runned medium, such as a journal, that individual has every right to say what he/she has to see without the worry of having another individual decided what is write or wrong.  For example,  WHICH I STATE I DO NOT AGREE WITH , are websites devoted to racial slander such as the Klu Klux Klan and Nazi propraganda.  Can anybody say that they hold a degree of proper etiquette when they are stating their views?  It's this situation that is often said as "Damned if you do, damned if you don't!"  Free speech and proper etiquette do not have to be intertwined with each other.  Again, I have to ask what are the rules of etiquette for writing a journal?  Yes, this journal is on a public forum which is called Blogger.  However, that's where the similarities of public and private forum end.  I state again that the individual has a right to say what he/she has to say in an individual medium.  As a reader, they have a right to not read the journal.  I have read many journals and all of them may have a form of etiquette or choose not to.  I know with LiveJournal, doesn't the individual have a right to filter out who can comment their writings?  I know another journal where the background has woman posing as a mermaid, being that she was fish-like from waist down and topless waist up!  Is that proper etiquette?  Other journals that I have read often go into great detail about the individuals private life, such as realationships and sex life.  What is proper etiquette for them?  In coming back to me, I know that I should have shown more restraint on what I said.  However, I did not name who I thought was the one who I thought was anonymously criticizing me.  For that reason did I show etiquette for her out of respect.  When I did found who was being anonymous, I apologized to that person, who came out to be Narintara.  As for showing what you make call etiquette, I do not agree with because since this is my journal, I have the right to say what I have to say.  Thank you Meghan for bringing up the issue of etiquette in journal writing.  Even though I disagree with her comment, I still respect her.  Even though she criticized my etiquette of the past journal entries, for which she has every right too, she did so without being anonymous.  Like I said before, I respect anybody that will criticize me openly without hiding behind a veil of anonmity.  That is the point that I try to make.

      When I make a mistake, I will be the first to admit that I was wrong.  I am wrong in this case.  I openly take responsibility for both my words and my actions.  Metaphorically speaking, I walked into the firing squad on my own violition.  I first want to apologize to that person, the one that I thought that wrote the criticism, the one that I did care about.  I'm sorry that I thought it was you.  I should have known better that it wasn't.  However, know that I don't have any regrets for the rest of what I said.  I had to say what was in my mind and heart.  I had to say what I had to say. I would also like to apologize to Narintara, my unknown reader.  I am wrong for thinking that you were someone else.  I'm sure after reading these entries, you probably think I am insane.....you are right.  You and every reader have every right to not read my journal, and I wouldn't blame you if didn't, especially that person who I cared about. I want to leave you all with some advice.  Don't hold in any resentment or regret in your life.  The more that you hold in, the more it poisons your soul and mind.  I apologize for any speculation of doubt that I held but I do not regret my statements that I made.

      For the last three days, I have been stuck inside from this recent snowstorm.  When being stuck for that amount of time, you do a lot of thinking.  Too much thinking can cause you to go insane after a while.  I guess that is what this entry is about….my much anticipated insanity.  Actually more to the point, it relates to the last entry, about my rant on Valentine’s Day.  In my last entry, I stated that I would not “rant and rave” about the day, but I did anyway.  From an anonymous reader, this criticism was pointed out as a comment.  However, I will not apologize for what I say.  This is my journal and I have the right to say what I want, do I not?  My purpose of this journal is let people to get to know me because I know I tend to keep to myself or shut myself off completely at times from most people.    Going back to the point, I wanted to say that I’m angry with the anonymous reader that made the comment.  It’s not the fact that this person made the comment, but that the reader tried to hide behind the secrecy of being anonymous. I know for a fact that this reader has made past criticizing remarks with other entries also trying to be anonymous, but never any supportive remarks.  I have to ask the reader the purpose for such anonymity when reading my journal?    The first comment made by Billy Bob Baker was honest I felt.  That reason being was because I made that comment.  I use that name as sort of a rebuttal to myself, or figuratively speaking, I’m kicking myself in the ass over it after realizing that I put my foot in my mouth.   I realize it may sound unusual…insane really…but I do it for my personal reasons.  I’m sometimes at odds with myself and it’s in this way I can analyze what I said and get over it.  However, from the other comment, the reader tried to be anonymous.  What the reader failed to realize though is that they might not be totally anonymous when they make a comment.  After making a comment, the reader’s IP address shows up with the comment.  I can compare this IP address to Site Meter, a site that records the Domains of each reader that links to my journal.  There are a few domains that I cannot narrow down who the readers are, such as aol.com.  However, when I know who has what IP address with the domain, I know who reads my journal.  This unknown reader is not anonymous to me anymore because I found the domain that they use and I know of one person who reads my journal from that domain, lwc.edu.  Now I may be mistaken by this guess, but I know this person.  Actually a young woman, who I had in my life over a year ago, but our paths went separate ways when I ended our relationship in late 2000.  I can honestly say that she was my first relationship, my first love.  To this day, I regret the way I ended things with her, I regret letting her go, and hurting her.  Now that our paths have gone in separate directions, this last year, I had hoped to have a friendship with her just recently.  I have tried subtly send messages to her like emailing her a few times to get a dialogue going but it just seems to be that awkward, “How are you doing, How is everybody doing?” talk.  I didn’t want to push it too much.  I’ve tried other ways just to bring in on my life.  I still see her screen name on my AIM, so I hoped if she saw that I had a link to my journal in my AIM profile, she would be curious to know how I was doing.  It worked when I saw in Site Meter that her Domain, lwc.edu, was on there.  Also, lately, I wanted to acknowledge her birthday by way of my journal and e-card.  So now that I find that she anonymously criticizes me in my journal, I am deeply hurt.  When you find that someone that you loved and cared about….and still love and care about….does nothing but criticize your writing, I can’t help but feel angry and hurt.  Not because of the fact that you criticized me, but because you try to hide your identity to me.  As I think about it I know the hurt that I caused you when our relationship ended may not compare to the hurt I feel now but I know I was wrong when I did that and I still hold that regret.  I know that we will never have a relationship again, but I wanted to believe that we could form a relationship out of friendship.  Now that I have completely opened up in this entry, I did not want to hold anything back.  I’m tired of holding everything in, tired of the regrets, and tired of not saying anything.  I have to ask, for what purpose do you anonymously criticize me?  Is that the only reason that you read my journal, to find some to criticize about me and use that to hurt me?  If so, you do a great job only because you hide behind a supposed veil of secrecy.  I only respect those that have the decency to criticize and rebuke me openly.  I still would like to be a friend but it does not seem fair when one of us will do so in trying.      This is ranting and raving and I have every right to do so in my journal.

      Yes, today is Valentine's Day.  Yes, whatever!  Now I can rant and rave about this supposed holiday.  I could argue that this, like everybody says, is just a Hallmark holiday.  However, I could say that if I had someone special in my life, I would be celebrating it all together.  No....I'm not doing either.  To those that are reading this....those who have significant others or dates, I hope you have a great time.....and to those who don't, let's be optimistic about next year. Anyway, I didn't even want to think about it today but a few things did have to bring me into the fold.  I did get a Valentine e-card from a friend, in which I never expected to anyway.  Also, when I got home, my mom had actually got my dad and I a Valentine gift.  I told her before hand that I didn't want or expect anything.....but she did anyway.  She got my father a framed picture of his favorite NASCAR driver.....Bill Elliot.  She got me a DVD....."Sweet Home Alabama"!  I was both thankful and resentful about the gift, because it was thoughtful of my mom to get me that but it also makes me feel how lonely I am to just get something from your mother.  I'm not saying that I'm complaining.  I'm guilty of not thinking about other people and sending them Valentine's notes/gifts.....but I have been asking myself what is the point.  I try too hard remembering people's birthdays and it's a let down when they forget yours.  So I think it's easier to not send anything to friends on Valentine's because I don't expect anything in return. Anyway....I don't want to go down that road.  I told myself I wouldn't rant or rave.  I am going to go out to dinner with my parents after work to a nice restaurant.  I will probably stop before hand to get some flowers for my mom.   Well...anyway, there's always next year!

      I think I'm getting to a point of where caring too much is hurting me.  I think the only way to stop that hurting is to stop caring.  I wish it was only that simple.

      Well, it's official....I'm a property owner.  I closed with the bank today to buy 2 acres of land in Albermarle Co., in the Blue Ridge Mountains about 20 minutes outside of Charlottesville.  I don't think it's really sunk in yet.  I hear from other people that they don't know many 25 year old's that own land or their own house.  This summer I should start building my own house.  Some would say this shows maturity....to those that think that, I say to them "Nany Nany Boo Boo!  You don't have a house and I do!"  I'm kidding...I'm kidding!   Anyway, I showed several co-workers the ideas of what to build.  They offered a lot of insights to most of the plans that I didn't realize!  It's going to be a hard choice of what to build!

       urlLink   urlLink   The Adventures of a Home Owner!   Some of you know that I'm in the process of building my own home.  It's a very long and tedious process.  Right now I am really just starting.  First I have to buy some land, which I will do by buying 2 acres from my uncle.  I will be closing this deal with the bank on Monday!   In the mean time, I have been looking at designs for building homes.  I was looking into both log cabins and stick built (wood) homes.  I've been meeting several places and people about log cabins these past few weeks.  I decided not to go with a log cabin because the insurance is very high for them, being both a fire hazard and acceptable to termites.  So, it's come down to deciding on a stick built house.  I found a lot of designs for them.  I found a website,  urlLink Homeplans.com , and found several that I liked.  I think the one that I most like is this,  urlLink Plan # VL-947 , a Victorian style 2 Bed, 1 Bath home.  I'm sure I'll tweak it here and there but the plan should stay the same.  There were other plans that I like too so it is hard to decide right now on which one I like.  I keep changing my mind with this. So those that are reading this, go check out both the website and take a look at the plans.  I'm mainly looking for something less than a 1000 sq. ft, with 2 bed and 1 bath.  I would like to hear all of you all's opinons?

      Everybody keeps telling me that I have a stupid grin on my face all the time.  I can't help it that I smile so much.  It's not like I'm happy all the time.  I battle the shitty and meloncholy moods too like everybody else, but I don't really show it!  I guess the way I look at it is if you smile to someone, it brightens their day a little bit longer, right?  NO....not really.  I just like getting people paranoid!!!  Smiling makes me look more devious and mysterious.  Yeah, that's it.....more mysterious!

      I find it easier to talk to God in the arms of nature with it's solitude.  Last night I got to do that after coming home from a friends house last night.  A few miles away from where I live, there is a fishing pond.  In the summer, I occasionally go there during the night, when it's still with silence.  Actuallly that's not really true!  I can hear the crickets sing in harmony, the sound of the water draining into the well in the lake, and hear the trees whisper as the wind blows them side to side.  Though there is a road next to it and an occasional car passes by, it's easy to get lost in the silence.  I can see the lights of the houses that are on the one side of the lake.  I will look up to the heavens and see the billions of stars that blanket the dark sky above and they multiply in the reflection of the lake before me.  As I said before, I actually went there last night.  It's often too cold to do it in the winter so I usally have to wait until spring.  With the weather actually a bit warmer, I decided to just seek out this solitude last night.  I spent a few minutes there to reflect what has happened with the Columbia and just wanted to talk with God about life.  I don't think I can do that in church as most people would believe.    For the longest time, I just stared out at the vast night sky in reflection.  I could feel that there were several new stars up there in honor of the astronauts.  I could just feel that each star is all our ancestors, looking down upon us in both hope and confusion for our future.  Our destiny belongs out there, to explore the far depth of not only physical space, but of the space that lies within us we call the human mind and emotion.    Even though it was only a few minutes that I was there, it helped calm my heart and soul.  It's often a struggle to deal with hardships and whine over missed opportunities, but in this way, it helps with meditation.  I found that in solitude, even though it's very lonely, you often find more of yourself in those moments.

      I had a date with Stacey last night.  We started out by going to the Outback, but when we got there, it was a 70 to 80 minute wait!  We both agreed we couldn't wait that long!  So as we came out, I saw a place called Winner's Circle Grill.  It was a racing themed restaurant located at Albermarle Square.  Kelly...you would like it!!!  After finishing, we went to see  The Recruit , starring Al Pacino and Colin Farrell.  I have to say it was just a big yawn after seeing it.  My biggest quip is that Colin Farrell seems to not shave throughout the whole movie!  After that, we went back to her place and video games with her roommate until 11:30!  In other news, it sad to hear that the Space Shuttle Columbia is reported as missing and thought to have exploded!  Such saddness for all because I remember where I was when I heard about the Challenger explosion.  I know this will not be good for our space programs.  I just hope it's not terrorist related with it being a Jewish astronaut on this mission.  I am watching the news right now and all they show is a huge fire ball falling to earth.  Words cannot begin to explain the saddness of this.

       To have friends means being a friend   It's often difficult to be a friend these days.  Sometimes I feel like I lack the heart and patience in being one.  It often eludes me of why it's so hard making new ones.  On occasion I believe that I suffer from social anxiety which makes it hard for me to make friends or be a friend to those that I have.  Some friends come and go and some stay with you throughout your life.  Yet, savor the time that you have.

      I got this in my email.  If you are a John Cleese fan or just a fan of English humor, you will like this!   AXIS OF EVIL WANNABES  by John Cleese   Bitter after being snubbed for membership in the "Axis of Evil", Libya, China and Syria today announced that they had formed the "Axis of Just as Evil", which they said would be more evil than that stupid Iran-Iraq-North Korea axis President Bush warned of in his State of the Union address.  Axis of Evil members, however, immediately dismissed the new Axis as having, for starters, a really dumb name. "Right. They are just as evil...in their dreams!" declared North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.  "Everybody knows we're the best evils...best at being evil...we're the best." Diplomats from Syria denied they were jealous over being excluded, although they conceded they did ask if they could join the Axis of Evil. "They told us it was full," said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. "An axis can't have more than three countries", explained Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "This is not my rule, it's tradition. In World War II you had Germany, Italy, and Japan in the evil Axis. So, you can only have three, and a secret handshake. Ours is wickedly cool." International reaction to Bush's Axis of Evil declaration was swift, as within minutes, France surrendered. Elsewhere, peer-conscious nations rushed to gain triumvirate status in what has become a game of geopolitical chairs. Cuba, Sudan and Serbia announced that they had formed the "Axis of Somewhat Evil", forcing Somalia to join with Uganda and Myanmar in the "Axis of Occasionally Evil", while Bulgaria, Indonesia and Russia established the "Axis of Not So Much Evil Really as Just Generally Disagreeable". With the criteria suddenly expanded and all the desirable clubs filling up, Sierra Leone, El Salvador, and Rwanda applied to be called the "Axis of Countries That Aren't the Worst But Certainly Won't Be Asked to Host the Olympics".  Canada, Mexico and Australia formed the "Axis of Nations That Are Actually Quite Nice But Secretly Have Some Nasty Thoughts About America", while Scotland, New Zealand and Spain established the "Axis of Countries That Want Sheep to Wear Lipstick". "That's not a threat, really, just something we like to do", said Scottish Executive First Minister Jack McConnell. While wondering if the other nations of the world weren't perhaps making fun of him, a cautious Bush granted approval for most axis, although he rejected the establishment of the "Axis of Countries Whose Names End in 'Guay", accusing one of its members of filing a false application. Officials from Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chadguay denied the charges.  Israel, meanwhile, insisted it didn't want to join any Axis, but privately world leaders said that's only because no one asked them.

      Today happens to be my mom's birthday!  She turns 44!  I got her one of those special messege bibles that she likes.  I left it out on the table for her so she could find it this morning!  Tonight, I think my father is taking her out to her favorite restaurant, Rococo's! Here's another note for today being a special date.  It's a unusal, wierd, and one of those I-wish-you-didn't-tell-me special occasions that I realized after my mom told me.  Today is also the day that 26 years ago, I was conceived!!!  It's something that you really don't want to think about, especially on your mom's birthday!    In other news, I am about through with my car.  I recently wrote that I had transmission problems with it and I had asked my mechanic to install it when he receives it from another place that was selling it cheaper.  He called yesterday, telling me that he installed my transmission, however, he found something else wrong with the car.  Apparently the front axial was worn away and he already installed it for 100 dollars!  He tried to say if I didn't put in now, I would have to in another month or so and it would cost me 150 for one!  All in all, the total for the transmission, the axial, and for installation of both came out to a whopping 1333.35 dollars!!!!   DAMMIT!!!!  I'M BROKE!!!!!!!  However, salvation came in the form of my parents, who have said that they would loan me some money for the car.  I will pay them back eventually after I build my house!  As for my car, it's going to last me hopefully another year.  After that, I'm getting a new one no matter what!

      I went to the local Food Lion after work to get some bread.  As I get in the "12 item's or less" line there, I see my uncle is at the head of the line trying to buy groceries.  However, to me it seems that he has more than 12 items!  I don't say anything to him because there are two other women between us, so I just watch him and see what he does.  Pretty soon a few people start to line up behind me to wait, including a young woman trying to by some beer and wine.   Anyway, as we are standing there, I see that the person at the register has finally totaled all my uncle's groceries.  My uncle tries to use one the the firefighter credit cards he has (he's the chief of fire fighters at where I live) and is told that the credit card has expired.  He tries to explain to the cashier that he has another credit car that is current, but he still holds line.  He finally decides to use cash since he can't find the current credit card.  During this time I can hear the young woman behind me talking on her cell phone describing to the other end what's going on with my uncle.  I can tell that she getting frustrated....as am I and I'm sure the other people waiting in line. So right when the cashier rings up the groceries with cash, my uncle finds the current credit card and asks the cashier if he can use that.  At that moment, I can hear a collective sigh of frustration from the people in front and behind me.  The cashier tries to get the attention of the manager in hopes to find a way to return the cash and use the credit card.  I overhear the manager say that they would have to rering up all the groceries!  I said to myself..."Oh shit!"  He see's me and I all I can do is laugh at him!  Again, you have to realize that this the "12 items or less" line and he has more than 12 items. So they rering him up, and finally uses his credit card to buy the groceries.  He finishes, and carts the groceries to the car.  As he leaves the store, the young woman behind me says "I would be embarrised if I had to find out that I had more than 12 items to ring up in the "12 item's or less" line and hold everyone up like he did!"  I chuckled to hear this and turned to her and said, "Yeah, I know!  And I know the guy.....he's my uncle!"  She then say's, "Oh!  I'm sorry!"  I just chuckled again and told her "It's all right.  He can be a pain in the ass sometimes anyway"!  So kiddies....what's the moral of this story?  Never have more than 12 groceries in the "12 items or less" line when you go shopping.  You just piss people off when things go wrong....that's including people who know you and are related to you!

      What a marvelous day it was!  It was a good day to take a walk, don't you think?  I went for a 10 mile walk actually.  I enjoyed it but I'm sore right now, legs hurting, and I got a sunburn.  I probably waved to everybody that passed me!   Actually got to talk to an old friend, Jared Groot, along the way.  Found out he is back home after being broke and his mother is in the hospital!  I could only give him my best wishes and prayers for her.  Most of what we talked about was just the natural nostalgia of who's with who, who's married/dating, who's sleeping with who, and who's just disappeared altogether!  Nostalgia tends to make me meloncholy lately because it's hard to digest how people are and do now.  God, I hate growing up!  Thinking about this reminds me of one of my poems....   The Loss of Innocence    Why must we lose our innocence to the necessity of experience? Why must the innocence of a child be lost to the experience of an adult? Why must we lose the innocence of the mind, the body, and of the world? The mind of the child must lose the innocence of love and unselfishness to the experience of the adult mind of hate and greed. The body of a child must lose the innocence of purity to the physical and sexual experience of the adult body. The world of a child must lose the innocence of a mother's comfort and safety to the experience of war and death of the world of the adult. Why must the child lose this innocence to the experience of the adult? The child must sacrifice this innocence to gain the experience of the adult to grow and survive as one and with the world.   The world has no patience for innocence anymore.  We long for it again but we know that it has to be sacrificed in order to survive.

      I hate that feeling you get when you don't know what the hell you are doing but you find out that you doing it right!  That's been like that at work lately.  I just feel so lost with some of things that are going on.  And then there is my car.  A used transmission is going to cost me 850 dollars, but that doesn't include the 250 to 300 dollars for installation/labor.  Once I get it, I hope my car will last me for at least a year.  I'm looking into buying another vehicle, maybe a Subaru Outback or a Toyota RAV4, something that has AWD!  I know, it's not much of a "chic" magnet with a Subaru Outback, but what's going to be the difference from now?  The other hard choices right now is trying to pick out a color scheme for my house.  It's hard enough to pick the plans for it, now I have to think about what kind of cabinets, what color, what wood, what style, what kind of knobs.  I think I'm getting a headache!  I do like the cherry color though!  Oh....by the way...has anybody tried this:  "Fill a condom with water and put it in the freezer.  Once it's frozen, take it out, peel off the latex, and have fun (wink, wink) with the ice!"  Actually this came from a day calender of sex tips that my co-worker had.  I had to laugh at first when he showed it to me but I'm actually wondering if that would really work?  Anybody knows?

      This peom was sent to me in an email.  I wanted to share it with everybody.   SLOW DANCE     Have you ever watched kids on a merry-go-round?  Or listened to the rain slapping on the ground?  Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight?  Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?  You better slow down.  Don't dance so fast.  Time is short.  The music won't last.  Do you run through each day on the fly?  When you ask how are you?  Do you hear the reply?  When the day is done do you lie in your bed,  With the next hundred chores running through your head?  You'd better slow down  Don't dance so fast.  Time is short.  The music won't last.  Ever told your child, We'll do it tomorrow?  And in your haste, not see his sorrow?  Ever lost touch, let a good friendship die  Cause you never had time to call and say,"hi".  You'd better slow down.  Don't dance so fast.  Time is short.  The music won't last.  When you run so fast to get somewhere  You miss half the fun of getting there.  When you worry and hurry through your day,  It is like an unopened gift....thrown away.  Life is not a race.  Do take it slower.  Hear the music before the song is over.

      I was able to catalog all the movies that I got from my late Uncle Bob, who died this month last year.  He was an avid movie buff, collecting movies and movie books.  The final count that I got for all the movies were over 500!  I'm elated that I have so many.  However, some of those include taped Oscars, televison specials, and concerts.  If ImKwazy is reading this...I have several tapes of the Three Tenors which I hear that you like Oprah singers like Pavorotti.  I can send you a copy if you want!  I was surprised to even find a B-rated porn!  Actually it wasn't that good since it didn't show penetration and the actors/actresses simulated sex!  I'm just surprised that my uncle had one!

      Okay...this entry is devoted to Dinglebert Humperdink and Gladis Vazquez!  You asked for it....you got it!   Dating women   I haven't been in a dating mood lately.  I know it's exciting to hear the juicy tidbits of dating like sweet romance and getting laid.  However, I'm afraid that I have to disappoint you when I say I haven't had that in a while.  I could say that I'm focusing on building the house and work, but the truth is I'm not in the mood or I'm just too damn lazy to date right now.  However, I will provide you with this bit of gossip.  As you may know, I am building a house soon.  The area that I am building is actually surrounded by my mom's family.  However I was recently told by my friend Kelly, that she knew of someone who lived near the area I was moving too.  I told her that I would like to meet her since I would like to find a neighbor who I'm not related too.  I would like to say that I have made contact with this person...woman....this week and have started talking to her over email!  I will have to keep you informed in the future.   My House   Well, nothing much to report about that.  I haven't started yet and won't until this summer.  All I'm doing right now is paying off the land for it.  In a previous entry, I told you about the home show that I went to last Sunday!  Oh, and Dinglebert...stick built houses are another name for just regular wood siding houses.  I was thinking about log cabins but I found that insurance on them are insane!   My Eating Habits!   Ok...why on Earth would anybody care about my eating habits.  Yes!  I am a picky eater!  I am a freak!  End of story!   Poetry   I will include some more poetry in the future.  Right now, I seem to have writers block and can't think of anything new.  If I think of something I will share it, or I could just share some of the others I have, but again I will include it in the future.  In the mean time, why don't you share some with me!   My Predictions on the NCAA Tournament   The only thing I care about for the NCAA is my Virginia Caviliers!  If they get into the Tournament, then Go Hoos!!!!   Fashion Tips   Now who the hell wants fashion tips from me???  I'm not gay!  I'm just a t-shirt/blue jeans kind of guy!  The only tip I know for me is that I don't like Pink!!!!   My Birthday!   My birthday is on Dec. 24th.  That's many months away.  I'll be 26!  But by the time it comes around, most everybody forgets. That's why I hate my birthday!   My feelings!   You know I'm sure it would be a woman to ask me this!  Let's see...what am I feeling?  Tired! Frustrated! Meloncholy! Horny!  All work related too....well, not being horny though.  That's a completely different story!  Anyway that's about it that moment.  Well, if you have any more questions or suggestions on what to write, I gladly write about them!  Just be careful what you ask!!!!   PS:  Did I put enough "!" in?

      I have been wondering lately if there are rules or etiquette for links to other journals?  The few journals that I have linked from mine, I either know the people personally or having emailed them a few times after reading their journals.  It sounds strange but do I have the right to link any journal to mine without consent?  There are several journals that I have read from time to time that I like very much because they are compelling or stimulating.  For example, for the last week, I have actually read a journal written by a porn actress who is very intellectually stimulating.....and yes, I find it also very compelling by it's sexual material.  So is there etiquette to wanting to link this journal to my own?  I may not agree with the lifestyles, or beliefs, or morals of the people whose journals I read, but at the same time I find myself drawn to know these people have all at least one thing in common.....the need for communication.  I respect all walks of life but I know that I would be judged by those very same people.  But oh well.....that's life.  It will go on with or without us anyway!

      I'm adding a bio section on the side of my journal.  I know it seems too much but I know I probably scared a few people after commenting in their journals!  I just wanted to show I'm not a wierdo or anything...but I'm sure they would after reading my journal.  Make a suggestion about what I should add to it!

      My folks got back last night from thier trip to Massachusetts.  I told them about the bad news about my car and they were very supportive about it.  The brought back tons of movie books that my late great Uncle Bob had.  I was recently told I can have his collection of movies and books that he owns.  He actually owned several hundred movies and books and I get to have all of them.  So once I finish my house, I will have an entire library of movie memorabilla!  Hehe....quite impressive I must say! So after church today, we all went to the home show at UVa.  I was able to go through a lot of showcases for several products in lookiong into what I can use for my house.  I was quite impressed with the selection they had.  However, I have to say that my mom put it out best about our skills in knowing about home construction when she told my father that she and I were dummies at this and that my father was the one to really know what to ask and look for!  I had to agree with her since I know nothing of what to ask or look for in home construction, though there were a few things I liked! Actually, at one point, my mom embarrased me!  I was going through some of the showcases, where one had a young redhead assisting a vendor.  I told my mom about this young woman with her gorgeous blue eyes, and my she said that she would go over to her and tell her that.  I thought she was kidding and told her not too.  However, in our second time around the place, she actually went over to the girl and told her what I said.  HOLY SHIT!!!  I couldn't believe that she actually told the girl that I thought she was beautiful!  When my mom came back over, she told me that she wasn't married but was in a committed relationship!  I was just so embarassed about it!!!  God, I'm not telling anything anymore! So I'm going to have to rummage through some of the stuff within the next few months and decide what I like.  I know I'm going to get a couple headaches in the coming months!  I hope it will be worth it! After coming home, I got an email from my friend Kristina asking if anybody wanted to come with her to a Dave Matthew's Concert in September.  I really want to go!  I'm sure no one knows this but I have never been to a concert before!  Also, no one has ever asked me to come to a concert with them before!  I would love to go but I'm worried about my financial situation, such as putting a new transmission on my car or with the house!  Hopefully, I can find someway to go!

      A perfect end to the perfect week.  Last week at this time, I had to pay 250 dollars to replace the exhuast pipe after getting it inspected.  Arggh.  Then this whole week at work has just been a shitty time.  I've been trying to deal with a seperate department trying to make my work harder and I get reamed for no reason, TWICE!!!  So today, it just keeps getting better....my car breaks down right after work!  More precisely, my transmission blows!  So as my folks are spending time up in Massachusetts, I have no way to call them to pick me up.  Well, it's a good thing that I had my cousin's cell number and she was able to pick me up and take me home!  God...I'm tired of this shit!

      My folks left early to go up to Massachusetts this weekend.  I pray for a safe trip to and from there for them.  I watched the finale of "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!" last night.  Cris Judd won!  I think he only won because of sentiment he got after talking about J. Lo!  I still say it was a joke....but they did it for a worthy cause really.  That was to raise money for charity.  I also wanted to share with you a link that some of my friends up in Northern Virginia sent me last night.  It's a website that's devoted to the  urlLink LADDER THEORY , which is a theory on adult male/female interaction.  Basically, the creator of the theory tries to explain why men and women can't really be friends based on the rules of attraction.  I personally think it's full of shit!!  There is no evidence that leads the theory to be true, just the writer's bitter opinions against the female species.  Please....go ahead and read it.  I would definetly like to know a female perspective on this.

       Quote of the Day!    There are a lot of folks who can't understand how we came to have an oil shortage here in America.  Well, there's a very simple answer...... Nobody bothered to check the oil. We just didn't know we were getting low.  The reason for that is purely geographical: All our oil is in Alaska.... All our dipsticks are in Washington D.C.

       Weekend update   Was suppose to go down and visit my grandmother on Saturday in Newport News.  However, I changed my mind and decided to stay home.  I know.....I'm a bad grandson!  Instead, I went to see the new movie "Identity" with John Cusack.  Interesting movie I must say.  Until the last 20 minutes of the movie, you don't know what is going on!  But it's in that last 20 minutes, you realize what is going on and you say to yourself..."AHHHHhh...I see"!  I think it's a combination of Alfred Hitchcock mystery and Stephan King suspense.  I think John Cusack is such an underrated actor in Hollywood.  It's hard to get away from that "unlucky in love, hopless romantic" type he usually plays except for a few roles he has had.  Throughout the movie, he is just so melocholy in his acting.  There were a few roles that I wanted to see more of, like of Jake Busey.  It's always his teeth that always catch your eye......just like his father too!!!   Ray Liotta is always a scary mf whatever part he plays!  Amanda Peet...well, I think with enough roles under her belt, she can be a great actress.  She has that simple and cute but very sexy aura to her.  I liked her in "The Whole Nine Yards" but not because she showed her breasts!  Would you believe me if I said I liked her eyes?  No...you wouldn't, would you!  Well...that's the truth and I'm sticking by it.  Anyway that was the extent of my weekend.  There was one notible discussion I had on Sunday with my father.  I was in the car when I was thinking about something on social status and cars.   I turned to them and said "Do you think that the car that we drive is often a reflection of our social status?"  I was thinking about that recently because I see so many people....many of them the young teenagers and the "Cool" guys....driving the supped up race cars and trucks.  Sometimes I wish I was driving a nice car like a BMW or these new vehicles that they have instead of my crappy 1992 Mazda Protege!  Well, the answer that my father gave me shouldn't have surprised me.  He said, "Do you think that the car that you drive is a reflection of your character?"  Leave it to my father to come up with the simple truth.  I guess you have to ask yourself "Are you a better person if you drive a nice car?"  I guess not.....but it does help the ego!

      In a serious meloncholy mood tonight.  Last week, a friend of mine is considering moving to North Carolina.  She told me the reason for it and I'm not entirely sure it's a good reason.  But she will make up her own mind.  However, she's not the only one too.  I got a letter today from a friend of mine that lives in Northern Virginia.  In June, she is moving to Colorado.  Today is actually the day that this friend is suppose to give birth to her child too!    (expunges a sorrowful sigh)  That is life.  It hurts but you have to move on.  Wish it wasn't that painful.

       Weekend Recap   Long and painful weekend.  Saturday I went to help my cousin work on his house.  We got there at 9 and stayed until 7!  Spent the whole time putting up the ceiling in one room and putting up the walls on 2/3 rds of the inside.  Hopefully this hard work will pay off for me when it comes to building my house!  Today, after going to church, I went to a family dinner.  Spent some of the day hiding eggs for a few of my younger cousins and watching and helping them find them.  I also went to take pictures of the property that I bought, if anybody would like to see.  My highlight and highpoint of the day.....of this weekend.....was after dinner.  I decided to go outside to lie on the hammock to relax and maybe take a nap.  But I wasn't alone.....my cousin's 4 year old, Courtney, wanted to lie down beside me!  Made my weekend!  I think my cousin took a picture of us which I hope to get.  That was that.  Nothing really exciting.  Question.......Do you ever feel like part of your life, never ever goes right or the timing just sucks?  WHY?  I'm losing my patience.

       Hypothetically speaking.....   ALTRUISM  Main Entry: al·tru·ism  Pronunciation: 'al-tru-"i-z&m Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter Date: 1853 1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others 2 : behavior by an animal that is not beneficial to or may be harmful to itself but that benefits others of its species  From the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.  You know I was hoping for a little more audience participation in the previous entry!    Anyway, that was a question that one of my friends from college told us.  I thought it was thought provoking!  There's not an easy answer in the way you look at it.  In making a decision after considering the hypothetical question, there are probably several things you can consider:  1.  What does the person have to offer in living on?  Well, the pregnant woman offers life to a new beginning.  You would throw a pregnant woman off anyway?  For the old black woman, you probably ask what does she have to offer?  She has outlived her usefulness, right?  Well, she does offer her wisdom for the next generation!  What about the Buddist Monk?  Well, he is a man of faith and that is what he offers.  What it be different if he was Catholic, Protestant, or Muslim.  And last, we come to the man who has been convicted of rape.  I know a lot of people would suggest he go because of his crime.  But does that make it right?  He could offer redemption?  2.  Why should this person go on living?  In this you question, is there a reason that this person should go to die.  It's also a tough question to think about.  From a certain standpoint, you question what right does this person have to live?  For the pregnant woman, the reason was that she is heaviest of the bunch.  What about the elderly black woman?  She is old....she has had a long life.  Why not end her life now instead of in the possible near future?  Her age is a burdon.  what about the convicted rapist?  He has committed an injustice to society and should pay with his life!  It would be his redemption?  And what about the Buddist Monk?  Some say he should go because he doesn't believe in what I believe!  He is a non-believer and therefore his life should not go on!  3.  What about you?  Yes, that is the question?  Did you think about offering your life to saving others?  Are you willing to sacrifice yourself for a greater good?  That is what altruism is.  It's a hard decision that we do make in our lifes even though it is not as life threating as the example stated in the previous entry.  I know a few people who have to make a decision like this.  For example, my friend Pat wanted to go into the Air Force in December after graduating.  It was her life decision to do so.  However, in August she found out that she was pregnant.  At that point, she made an altruistic decision to sacrifice her dreams and opportunities for the life of her unborn child.  We will all make this decision, since as parents we tend to sacrifice our life for the hopes of our children, even it if it's not in a life threating situation.  There are other altruistic choices that we make including sacrificing our love, our hope for those that we love deeply.    So, for my answer in that Hypothetical question, I am willing to choose to sacrifice myself for the greater good of the rest.  It may not seem like the logical choice over the other canidates but it is my choice.   Just a note, a friend of mine told me about this hypothetical question after he heard it from his youth minister at church.  He told us that when the youth minister was asked who he thought should go, the minister said the Buddist monk!   His reasons that he said it was because he was a non-believer and should die!  Not all people should judge others for what they believe.....but judge upon character!

       Hypothetical Question   Your ship has sunk in the middle of winter in the North Atlantic.  The water is freezing and if you stay in the water for a just a short amount of time, you will die from hypothermia.  You are on a rubber life raft with 4 other people.  The people include a pregnant white woman, an elderly black woman, a buddist monk, and a white man in his 40's who has been convicted of rape.  The raft is starting to let water in because the raft is too heavy.  The only way to stop this is someone on the raft has to get into the water to save the others from sinking.  Who do you pick to go into the water knowing that they should surely die?

      So I decided to sign up for my church's softball team a few weeks ago.  We had our first practice today.  Ummm...a bit productive...I think!  I'm a bit sore at the moment but should be fine tomorrow.  If anybody is interested in supporting me and coming to the games, I would love for you to come out.  I'll give you the schedule of games.  I also rented a few movies this weekend.  I just finished watching "We Were Soldiers" with Mel Gibson.  Very heart renching movie about war!  The other movie was "Y Tu Mama Tambien".  Yes, it is a foreign film....Mexican to be more precise.  I thought it was a pretty good movie even though you had to read the subtitles to understand it.  Basically is a story about love, sex, and friendship.  Throughout the movie, a narrator interrupts the dialogue to tell a few stories about people that you don't even think about or don't really have a part to play in it.  You tend to miss the meaning unless you can understand why the narrator tells you this or until you can figure it out at the very end.  Also, the name....which in spanish means "And you Mother also".....is kind of a funny story in which you can also miss it if you don't pay attention.  But if you can keep your mind open throughout the movie and understand the end, it does have a sorrowful meaning about life.  Let's see.....my cousin's wife is doing fine since giving birth.  Also, I just wanted to say that my aunt who had a stroke is also fine.  I have two seperate friends who are expecting the birth of their children next week.  My heart and prayers go out to them.  I just want to say to all that have read the poem about Hope that I wrote in the previous entry on 4-7,  I want to say that it does hold meaning to everybody that I talk to.  After reading so many people's journal, I hear so many of those "No" thoughts.  I am especially quilty of saying them too.  We are all quilty of saying and thinking those words.  Don't lose hope.

       Happy Announcement!!!   I just learned today that my cousin's wife just gave birth today.  My cousin, Danny, and his wife, Carman, are naming their son, Massie Dale Raltson.  I don't know what the correct spelling is on the first name is, but that's his name!!!

      No patience.... No strength.... No courage.... No will..... No power.... No wisdom.... No truth.... Nobody there.... No one willing.... No happiness.... No thanks... No one listening.... No light.... No laughter.... No future.... No faith.... No life..... No passion.... No love..... Oddly...strangely....no hope  Commonplace words these days.  The line of excuses drowns the soul into the abyss of nothingness.  No one follows but everyone goes.  Everybody...I mean everybody....tends to lose hope in their lives today.  Even when you are your happiest, there's that tiny bit of that quicksand to get stuck in.  Shouts for help are often drowned out by the thousands of whispers we hear.  Take heed of the quietest one because they scream for hope, though they are never heard.    That is hope lost.  Hope returned, well, that is something far different.  Do not be afraid to lose yourself by losing everything.  Only when we have lost everything will hope be returned.  Remember No is just a word, never an action.  HOPE

       Spring forward today!!!   I am exhausted today!  Yesterday, I spent the day helping my cousin Danny work on his house.  I got there at 9 in the morning, to start on cutting out excess caulk off the walls.  After that was done, I went on to sand the porch railings.  Now you may say that isn't really hard, but I didn't realize that he has a porch on three sides of his house!  It's a huge porch!!!  It took me, and with the help of other family members, until 1:30 that afternoon to finish sanding all the porch railings.  Pretty much it was just me, my mom, and my cousin's wife Carman, who also 9 months pregnant, that sanded the porch!  At one point, which was actually quite cute and funny, my cousin Dee's four year old daughter, Courtney, came up to help and she sanded for just a little bit.  But you know how the attention span of 4 year olds are...she quit after a few minutes. After finishing at 1:30, my aunt Sheila brought lunch for us.  She was kind enough to get pizza from Pizza Hut!  It was two large pizzas to feed at least 6 people.  It was another funny about Courtney in this....she ate 5 slices of pizza.  She only left one slice of cheese pizza for Carmen, who again was 9 months pregnant! After lunch, we worked to stain the porch railings.  This time, my cousin Dee came by to help.  We started around 2:30 and didn't get to all of the porch when we finished around 7:30, when we couldn't see what we were doing!  I'm going back up next Saturday to help again!   I didn't get home until 8:30 last night.  Our phone lines were cut Friday night/Saturday morning because they are building a house on the lot next to us.  We assumed that they cut our phone lines.  Anyway I couldn't get on the internet Friday or Saturday morning and no phone calls.  Found out last night that my friend  urlLink Ginger , actually came up to Charlottesville, which was only 20 minutes from where I was working on my cousin's house, to visit.  She told me she called 4 times but never got the answering machine.  I told her about the phone being cut.  Her birthday is next Saturday, and I wanted to go visit her in Northern Virginia, but I told my cousin Danny that I help him again!  I felt bad to do this to her!   I'll find another time to come and visit her but I know it wouldn't be the same since it's her birthday next weekend!  So because of the daylight savings time, we have to put the clocks forward an hour.  That means we all lose a hour of sleep!  So this morning, not only is my body hurting from working yesterday, but I lose a precious hour of sleep!  So I am a bit cranky this morning among other things!

      I learned last night that my aunt had a stroke.  We found out that it was due to much stress and too much smoking.  She didn't heed the advice of her doctor last time she had a checkup.  As for my uncle who had a stroke months ago, who happens to be the brother of my aunt, he is doing quite well now.  He quit smoking and is fine.  He is currently building his new house. Anyway, I would appreciate any well wishes and prayers that you can send to my aunt.

       Otherwise engaged!   I feel like Chandler from  Friends ....well, the early years that is.  I remember a line that he had in one eposide where Ross's ex-wife, turned lesbian weds her girlfriend.  At the wedding, there are ton's of lesbians there and Chandler, who seems frustrated, turns to one of the other friend's and says "My world is a lesbian wedding!"  That's I feel with this world myself sometimes.  The reason....it seems like everyone I know is now engaged, or married, or married with children!  There are basically three people that I can only say this about now! The first is my high school crush, Brandy.  I had a crush on her throughout high school.  Near the end, she started dated her boyfriend, Tuan.  After graduating, I heard that those two got married and moved to California.  I didn't hear anything about them until a few years ago, a friend of mine told me she heard that Brandy and Tuan got divorced....or that was the rumor!  Anyway I didn't think anything about it. At the very beginning of this year, I signed up for  urlLink Classmates.com  and I saw them two.  I wrote to her but never got an answer so assumed that it was outdated since it said she was in California and married.  However, just last week, it seemed as though she updated.  I found out that she is still married, has one child, but is now in Virginia.  I couldn't pass up a chance to email her to see how she was doing.  I wrote to her yesterday so I haven't gotten any word yet.    There was another friend of mine that I also found on Classmates.com just last week too.  Her name is Michele and I went to college with her.  I also had a crush on her for a little while.  We lost contact with each other just before graduation, which was three years ago.  I was going through names last week, when her's popped up and I took the chance of looking for her in classmates.com.  I didn't see her name under my college but I did find several Michele's for other school's including high school.  I saw one that may have matched her so I took the chance to email her.  Low and behold...it was her.  She wrote back saying to email her and so I did, telling her about what I have been going through and that I missed her.  Well, she just emailed me back, and I learned that she is engaged!  Another lost dream I guess.  It doesn't end there!  Every Sunday, I have the need to look at Weddings/Engagements in the paper.  I am so addicted to it now because I am eager to see if I know anybody that is married or engaged.  Well, this week, I found someone that I knew.  Another girl that I had a crush on years ago named Elizabeth.  I meet her while working at Monticello during the summer.  She was very cute with a great smile and was also working the summer during school!  I thought about asking her out and one day I had the balls to finally ask her out.  However, after I told her that, she told me that she didn't have time to go with me now or during school!  I was so pissed off at the time but I just bit down my pride and tried to be friends with her after that.  Later, I learned that during that next semester, she was dating a guy at school!  That made me pissed off at her.  The next summer, while working at Monticello, she did work there but only for a little while.  Since then, I haven't talked to her.  So there you have it!  I swear it seems that whole world is just my lesbian wedding!

       HOLY SHIT!    urlLink Miami Cruise Ship on fire!   Both my parents were on that ship coming back from a week long cruise.  I didn't hear about it until just a few minutes ago when my grandmother called me.  I had just gotten back from church, when my grandmother called to say that my parents are alright and were fine.  I had asked what happened and she told me that they called her and told her that their cruise ship caught fire!  WHAT!!!  She told me that she talked to them and tried calling me but I was at church but they left a message.  I checked it after hanging up with my grandmother and they said they were fine.  But that was some scary shit.  I have to go pick them up from Dulles Airport at 4!

      Yeah....we finally had our first softball game of the season tonight!  This was suppose to be our third game but the first two were rained out!  We won though I might be the weak link on the time so far!  I went 0 for 2 with a walk!  Didn't do so well in the outfield either!  I think I'm going to start going to batting cages soon to practice and maybe try working out too!    Finally got information today about my friend Frankie who had her baby on May 8!  She had a girl, who she named McKinley!  I thought it was a boy at first!  I made the mistake of asking when he was born!!!  She had to have a C-section to give birth, and afterwards had to have an Appendectomy too after giving birth!  I'm just glad that they are both doing well!

       Dreamscape   You know how when you think about someone constantly, they tend to end up in your dreams?  I've been thinking about someone in particular for sometime now, someone that I loved.  That someone is not dead but I haven't talked to them for sometime now!  I guess I'm just thinking about this person because I miss her.  Anyway, I guess my thoughts finally caught up to my conscience and into my dreams.  However the dream I had about this special someone wasn't a very good dream.  It's one those dreams where that person turns into something that you never expect that person to become.  I know this someone to be the sweet and gentle person that she is but in the dream she did a complete 180 degrees, and became something darker that I never wanted to see her go.  It makes you wake up sweating and that gut wrenching feeling in your stomach.  What does it mean?

      I went to see X2 tonight.  I have to say that it was much better than I expected, especially coming from a sequel!  It had a good story and the I thought that all the characters were played very nicely!  There's a few things I am upset with but I won't give away all the details to those who haven't seen it.  I'll tell you one thing that I am disappointed is that they had a cameo of Dr. McCoy, who from what little I know about the Marvel Universe is the name of the X-men named Beast.  However, I'm disappointed because of two reasons for this....1. He has a very very short cameo...it's very quick if you don't know where to look....and 2. He didn't look anything like the blue beast that he is in the comics/cartoons.  He was human and the only way I knew it was suppose to be him was the name Dr. McCoy!  Other characters had brief cameos like Colussus, Siren, and Shadowcat.  I was hoping to also see more of Lady Deathstrike played by Kelly Hu.  She had a great fight scene with Wolverine! Well, there other parts of the movie that I like to talk about but I don't want to ruin it for those that haven't seen it.  I think everyone will want more after seeing this movie and I'm sure they will make a third one too!

       Softball and the Hawaiian themed cookout!   The weekend started on Friday with my softball team playing the only unbeaten team in our league, Victory Hill.  Victory was 7 and 0 while we had a 2 game losing streak going for us, making us 3 and 2.  I had it in our mind that this was going to be our third game that we lose since it seemd this team was good!  I thought this was going to be true when they scored 4 runs in first inning and we couldn't hit the ball in the next three innings.  However, around the 4th inning, we exploded.  We had 10 runs, with one guy hitting a homerun.  I myself, didn't come into the game until the 5th inning so I didn't contribute that much!  I only got one hit and that was barely a hit!  I also played catcher so I was a little apprehensive about have the bat so close to me.  Anyway, we scored another seven runs in the 6th inning but it seemed as though Victory was making a comeback when they scored 6 runs that last inning.  However, we won with the score being 17 to 10!  However, I was nervous about another reason with this game.  Loreley, the girl I'm seeing came to the game!  However, her parents came too and so did my parents....for the first time to see me.  I've played last fall for my company softball team but my parents never came because they were always busy.  I always told them that they could come but they couldn't.  So this time, I thought they would never come but apparently when I told them that I asked Loreley to come, I guess they wanted to come too!  So throughout the game, I was nervous about them seeing me.  Luckily, I didn't make a fool of myself!  How about that.....25 years old and I still get nervous about seeing my parents watching me!  Anyway, after the game, I introduced Loreley to my mom....well, actually I think she introduced herself to Loreley!  I know they meet her parents already at church but this seemed a bit different.  After the introductions, I wanted to stick around with Loreley at the park, while our parents went their seperate ways to go out to eat and back home.  I spent about a hour just walking the park with Loreley and talking.  She's cool!  Well, the next day on Saturday, I went up to Northern Virginia to go to a friends Hawaiian themed cookout.  It was at five but I came up early to see about visiting my friend Pat and meet her boyfriend and baby Mason for the first time.  However, when I got to the Fairfax Towne Center and called, she didn't answer.  I figured she was busy with moving out of her apartment since that is what she was doing that day.  So I figured I go in to see  Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle  in the theater at Fairfax Towne Center.  I have to say that I can't remember what the story was because it was all about the bootie in the movie.  I mean it was a lot of action but I can't seem to remember what the story was about or if there was really a plot to it.  Demi Moore was great though.  I go for those dark and sexy women!  I have to say that her body does rival Cameron Diaz!  But no plot whatsoever!  I guess that wasn't the point to begin with, right?  So, after the movie, I decided to call Pat again but still answer.  I was kind of disappointed since she is moving to Colorado in August and I don't know when or if I can see her again.  So I just decided to go to Wal-mart and Best Buy before going to the cookout.  After going into both places, I remember why I realized I didn't want to stay up in Northern Virginia anymore.  Everybody was just pushing and bumping everybody else.  It's too fast paced for me!  Give me good ole Charlottesville!  But hey...they are finally building a Best Buy down here now!  After my adventures there at Wal-mart, I went to the cookout.  However, I was and I seem to be always, the first one there.  Q and Robson were there because they lived at the place.  People were finally trickling in and it was awesome to see almost everybody that I knew from our little gang in college!  I was especially shocked to know that my friend Chau came because she is always the one who never wants to hang out with us.  We had a good time just hanging out on the porch with everybody talking about a wide range of stuff from who is doing what to the odd conversations like anal leakage!!!  Don't ask!!!  Trust me, it's a long story!  Around 12, our friend Nick showed us his movie he made about his adventures in Utah with a group of unicyclists!  He's been tooling around with being a unicycler for over 2 years now!  After everyone left, I stayed to spend the night there!  Sunday, not much happened besides coming back home!  I did call Loreley to come to my game this Tuesday since I have game tonight but she has class tonight.  I'm still trying to think of something to do on Friday with Loreley!

       Second chances   So I had a second date with Loreley.  She is so cool.  We definitely have a lot in common.  Last night, after getting off from work around 5, I pickered her up at her house.  We then got to Arby's to get some take out and I took her to the nearest park, Chris Greene Lake.  There we set up a little picknic near the lake and ate and talked for a few hours.  Around 8, I took her to play Putt Putt.  Had a fun time doing that.  Then I wanted to just take a walk with her so I took her to the softball fields at Hollymead school.  Around 10, I had her back at home.  I know it sounds way to early to let a date end but it takes me almost an hour to get back home!  Anyway, I think she likes me alot because she used the words nice, wonderful, and amazing throughout the evening to describe me!  I also wanted to say that I got in touch with a classmate from high school the other day.  Her name is Brandy Jenkins...now Brandy Bui.  I saw her profile on Classmates.com and wrote to her a few weeks ago.  Just the other day, she wrote back, telling me to her email her personal email.  So I did and she wrote back.  Found out she is living in Virginia Beach, has been married to her high school boyfriend, Tuan Bui who is now in the Air Force, and they have a 9 1/2 month old son, Branden.  I have to say it is pretty wierd talking to her because I had a crush on her all through my years in high school.  That was seven years ago.....which I left behind.  Anyway, I'm just trying to get a second chance to be friends with those that I didn't have a chance in high school.

      I forgot to tell you about my weekend date this past Saturday!  Every time I went into Church, Loreley, was also there at the door, either waiting or passing out pamphlets.  All I said to her when I saw her was hello and walk by into church.  It was about two weeks ago, that I heard that she was eying me and that she wanted me to ask her out.  I think it was two Sunday's ago that her stepmother actually ran into my mother and told her that Loreley was interested in me.  So I finally decided what the hell....to ask her out.  I was a bit nervous too and I told myself that I would do it when I saw her at Church last Wednesday night, but I chickened out!  However, I finally got the guts to call her the next night and ask her out.  I left a message on her recorder and she called me back later that night.  I know I sounded nervous to her but I just asked if she wanted to go out Saturday night (just this past weekend) and she told me where she lived. Well, the night came and I picked her up at her house.  I talked to her parents for a bit, since she is 19 and going to the local community college.  We left and went to dinner at my cousin's restaurant, Rococo's.  During the dinner, I found out that we had a lot in common.  We then finished dinner and went to see the movie "Finding Nemo".  It was actually a very good movie besides being a kids movie.  After the movie, I took her to get some ice cream and then took her home.   I have to say that I am glad I finally asked Loreley out.  She's great and we have alot in common.  I talked her Sunday and asked her about going out this Thursday.  I'm thinking of taking her to Putt Putt!

       Transformers:  The live action movie!   I just happened to learn from  urlLink Sci Fi Weekly  that a live action movie based on Transformers is being considered!  For those who don't remember, Transformers were robots in diguise!  There were toys and a cartoon of them that ran from 1984 to 1986.  Classic!  Not like the cheap overrated stuff they have on now!  And who could forget that there was an animated movie of the Transformers made in 1986.  I actually have it on both VHS and DVD format!  It was such a sad movie because as those who remember it, Optimus Prime died!!!  The great leader of the Autobots....DEAD!  It was the first time my childhood hero died and it was such a growing up experience! Back to the live action movie.  As we all know.....the jump from cartoon/video to live action doesn't always work!  How many movies have been made of our favorite cartoon characters and video games?  Most of them are just too damn crappy!  Anybody remember the live action movie of He-Man?  It was called  Masters of the Universe , and starred Dolph Lundren as He-Man.  We all know how great an actor he is now!  It was a bad movie!  However the only good thing about it was it gave Courtney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeil their break into the show business.  I'm sure you are asking yourselfs who the latter is...this Robert Duncan McNeil?  Well, if you are a Star Trek fan....you know who he is.  As for Courtney Cox....I'm sure you know her from the little show called  Friends  and the Scream Trilogy! And does anybody remember that the first great video game, Super Mario Bros. was made into a movie starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper!  That was even a more extraordinarly bad movie!  It just didn't make any sense! Then there was Street Fighter, the movie!  It starred Jean Cluade van Dam!  Right there you know it's a great quality film!  It was so bad, that it was the last movie Raul Julia was in since he died right after it!  The one bright spot in that movie was that Asian chick that stars in ER now! However, there a few...and just a few....movies made from cartoons and video games that are good.  One example that I can think of is Mortal Kombat.  That had the right amount of story, action, and music that really made it decent.  However, they had to screw up the francise by making Mortal Kombat Annihilation!  Anyway, I hope they don't screw up Transformers by making a live action movie out of it!  It's our heritage that they are screwing up!  Can anybody else tell me what other movies they have made out of cartoons/video games?  BTW....I'd like to see if they can make a live action movie out the Smurfs!!!!  Now that would something!

       The long weekend!   What a weekend!  It was long and tiring for me!  Here's what happened!  A co-worker on Friday gave me an invitation to her wedding!  Here's the kicker, the wedding is this Saturday coming up!  Apparently, it was a spur of the moment kind of thing.  My co-worker and her boyfriend decided to get married three weeks ago!  But here's the other thing about it....its a Hawaiian style wedding, meaning for guests to dress up in Tropical shirts, shorts, and sandels and all the decorations are tropical!  She's also having it at Old Rag mountain in the Shennandoah Park!  This should be something but I don't know if I'm going yet!  Friday night, we played our fourth game of the season.  Under the threat of thunderstorms, we still played!  It did rain for a little bit but nothing too serious!  We actually lost terrible!!   I think the final score was 20 to 9, and makes our record now 3 and 1.  I went 0 for 3 so I didn't help at all!    Saturday I went to help my cousin Danny work on his house.  It's almost ready to move in.  He put up the kitchen cabinets, which are really nice!  We helped with organzing the decks and sanding and staining the trim of the doors.  He had also just finished putting the wood floors in that day!  Hopefully he can start moving in in about two weeks.  After finishing up with what we could, we got cleaned up for a birthday party for a cousin.  He turned 3 years old. It was just a small birthday party with a few family members.  Well, Sunday was Father's Day!  I hope everybody wished their father's a Happy Father's Day.  It was also my father's 50th Birthday yesterday.  I got him two cd's for both his birthday and Father's Day.  However, I was outdone by my mother when she bought him a 1999 Ford F150 Supercab!   Anyway, we went to church that morning. After coming out of church, my mom was telling me that a young lady from church, who seems to be eying me lately, wanted me to ask her out!  Actually, the young lady's mother gave my mom, who happened to be working in the nursery that morning, her number to call and ask her out.  I've seen this young lady...she is cute with beautiful blue eyes.  I see this young girl every time I walk into church!  Anyway, I will think about calling her or probably just go and talk to her next time I'm in church. After church, we headed out to my cousin's house in White Hall.  There we were having a birthday party for my father and two of my cousins that were having birthdays around the same time.  It was just the usual birthday party scene.  When we got home last night, I found out that my friend Chau called!  I haven't talked to her in awhile!  So I decided to call her back.  She seemed to be doing fine though she is going through a hard time, though she wouldn't elaborate on the issue(s).  She never does.  However it disturbed me to hear that a mutual friend of ours is not doing so well herself.  Chau would not elaborate on what was going on with our friend but only to say that she, our friend, was in bad shape.  Our friend always seemed so stable and healthy when I was there, so when I heard something was wrong, I am just so worried about her.  Hopefully when I go up to NoVa in two weeks, Chau will tell me what's wrong with our friend.  It's just eating me up inside in wondering what is wrong with our mutual friend.  I can honestly say that I've never been a best friend, or a great friend, or even a good friend.....but I've always wanted to be a friend.  It hurts to know you don't know what is going on and you can't do anything to help someone when they are in need.  I just hope things will turn out fine.

       My evening out on the town!   Well, actually it was just a simple date that I went out with Michelle.  It started out meeting her for the first time in person at Pizza Hut.  We have a lot in common.  We then went over to see "Bruce Almighty".  It was one of Jim Carrey's funnier movies.  I enjoyed the theme of what would you do if you had God's power.  At one part, I cried because I laughed so hard.  I found out this morning that Michelle told me she saw me laugh and couldn't stop laughing.  After the movie, we told each other we had a good time and we go out again.  I'm sure of that since she emailed me this morning.  Though I'm personally thinking that she needs a friend more than anything else.  Actually, I do want to bring up the point that I hate dating or meeting people for the first time as friends.  It always feels like an interview and I hate having interviews.  There is so much hassle when you start out dating.  For me though, it's just that I'm not only a shy guy and it takes a while for me to feel comfortable, but that fact that I think I am just too damn picky!  I also worry about the rules, the "what if's", and the constant questioning of whether she likes me enough to go on a second, or third, or multiple dates!  Oi vay!  I hear married people say that they are glad that they aren't dating.  That they don't know if what they would do if they got divorced or something happened to their significant other. I just wish I go straight in the relationship and not worry about the hassle of dating.  Is it me or does everyone feel this way?

      I'm sorry for ignoring you....my devoted followers...for the past two weeks!  I have been busy the last two weeks.  Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about my weekend!  On Friday, we (my church softball team) played our third game of the season.  It was such a beautiful evening to play on too.  We won the game,16 to 6, which makes our record now 3 and 0 and 2nd place in our division.  I've been doing well myself, even though I had a slow start this season.  I'm currently batting 4 for 6 with two walks.  However, the bad news from the game is that one of our players broke his collarbone after tripping over first base.  On Saturday, I went to help my cousin Danny work on his house.  He is almost finished.  I helped clean the decks, organize the basement, sand and stain the doors, and move 40 boxes of hardwood floor around!  It seems both my cousin and I hurt our backs after moving them!  Another guy was working on the hardwood floors.  He should be finished within the next couple of weeks!  Then I'm off to help my uncle with his house!  On Sunday, it was just another lazy Sunday.  I went to church in the morning and did nothing but veg for the rest of the day.  However, I did finally get to talk on the phone with Michelle for the first time.  Michelle is a co-worker of my cousin Dee, who my cousin wanted me to meet.  We have been talking for the past week over email but I got to talk to her for an hour over the phone.  We seem to have a lot in common!  We are trying to schedule a time this or next week to meet in person!  I have also been some other woman that I like to go out with.  Two Wednesdays ago, I went to church to meet a former Miss Albemarle, Krystal, who my mom as been dying for me to meet!  I finally gave in to go to church on Wednesdays to meet this girl.  It seemed that her family was in on it too for us to meet.  I got to talk to her for a short while after church.  She is very beautiful!  She is currently a nurse at UVa and has a Ford Mustang with her last name on the license plate!  I was pretty much intimated in meeting her in the first place!  But I'm still going back on Wednesday night to see about talking to  her again!  There are other young potentials there also that I'm thinking about talking too!  Well, I keep you updated on how that goes!

      I just had a little insight for a quote!  "Fight fire with fire and fire keeps burning.  Fight fire with water, the fire becomes extinguished"    I know...it sounds a bit sappy but I thought about it when I was reading another journal.  The person in this journal was angry over an opinion that was written in a paper.  This person was going to write back to the paper with her opinion by arguing why it's wrong and using very explicit language.  It just occurs to me that we never solve anything if we do what the old saying does when we "fight fire with fire" right?  What is that we solved by doing that.    I guess at moment, I can help but think about the song "We Didn't Start the Fire" by Billy Joel.

      I keep meaning to write in this for the last couple of days.  Sometimes I just find that I don't the patience or time to write lately!  Anyway, I just wanted to recap the previous weekend.  On Friday, I invited Loreley to come to a family cookout.  This was the first time that she meet my mom's side of the family.  She already meet my mom's sister and her boyfriend when we went to dinner with them and my folks a couple of weeks ago.  I warned her beforehand that they were wierd and if they teased her, it meant that they liked her.  Apparently, after about 5 minutes, my uncle was teasing her, so I took it as a good sign.  We only stayed for about an hour and half, since we had to go visit her friend whose brother died last week.  While were leaving, she told me she didn't think that they were wierd but she did like them.  I heard later, that my family likes her too!  Very good sign!  After we left, right when we were getting to her friend's house, she got a call from a couple of other friends to say they were at the Mall with the girl whose brother had died to pick out some clothes for the funeral.  So we went there and meet them in Sears.  As they were trying to get the girl to try on the clothes, I told Loreley that I be in the book store since I was the only guy there with these 4 other girls.  You kind of feel a little bit awkward in the bra and panties department watching them argue over what to wear.  After they finished, Loreley found me at the book store and they were talking about going over to play Putt Putt and I thought it was a good idea.  I had a lot of fun playing there with them.  In the end, I beat all the girls in putt putt and I wasn't trying too!  I guess I must be that good!!!  After playing, we all went our seperate ways.  I took Loreley back to Kroger to drop her off at her truck.  Before meeting her to go to the cookout, I had bought her some red carnations.  I realized that I hadn't bought her flowers yet.  I think she really liked them.  On Saturday, I was expected to come up to help my parents help my mom's cousin with her house.  Before coming up, I picked up my cousin Megan from my cousins house across the street from my house.  She had spent the night with my cousin and the night before, they took Meghan to the Drive Inn at Fork Union.  It was her first time there which is pretty cool.  I haven't been there in two years!  I stopped at my my cousin's house to check with her and my mom to see if they needed my help.  They told me they didn't so I just went ahead to drop off my cousin Megan at her house and my cousin Dee was there.  When I got there, she told me she needed help with her homework.  She's now taking courses at UVa for the Radiology department.  She told me she was having trouble with the math, so I tried to help her out.  Of course, I have been out of school for three years and I haven't taken math courses for a longer period of time so I wasn't much help!  Anyway, after an hour of this, she had to take her daughter and my cousin Megan to the pool.  So I went ahead and came back home.  When I got back home, I just did a few household chores.  My folks got back home around 5 after working on my mom's cousin's house.  I had rented "Die Another Day" earlier and told them that we should watch it.  I had seen it in the theater's before but both of them have not seen it.  My mom loves Pierce Brosnon even though she doesn't really like James Bond movies.  It's actually quite funny when she said out loud, "These movies are always so unreal!!!".  My dad and I had to laugh because that was actually point to these movies!  On Sunday, I went to church but stayed for the Bible study class that Loreley is in.  This is the second week that I've attened the bible study class for the college students.  Loreley invited me so I wanted to come.  I actually enjoyed it!  After it was over, she went back home to study since she had exams on Monday so I wanted her to study.  I decided to go to "Cici's" for lunch.  This was actually the second Sunday in a row that I went there for lunch.  I mean they have good pizza that's pretty cheap!  I was kind of angry at one point when I got up to get a couple of slice of pizza from the buffet when one of the bus boys took my plate.  I still had a piece of good cheese bread on it!!!  Other than that, I had a pretty lazy Sunday afternoon.  I had to organize my late great's uncles movie books that we got.  He has few that are pretty nice like movie guides and picture books.  This is the same great uncle who died and I got all his movies, which came out to be around 500 in total!  Once I finish my house, I'll have to find a place to put all these things!  I have to ask, has anybody been watching this new show on FOX called "Banzaii".  It looks so stupid from the commercials but when you watch it, you have to laugh at them.  Apparently the Japanese have a wierd sense of humor.  I think the "Ask one question" lady is pretty funny because you get to see her ask celebrities one question and she just stands there doing nothing when they finish.  When they answer that question, it's equally funny to see how they react to her not reacting!!!  The one that was on the other night was with her and George Takei, "Mr Sulu" from Star Trek!

      So Loreley and I went out to see Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.  To me personally, I have two words to decribe the movie: IT SUCKS!  I didn't see the plot of the movie!  All it was was things being blown up or shot up!  I mean the Terminatrix looked great but it didn't make it better.  All Claire Danes does is scream throughout the movie except for one moment in which she fires a machine gun to destroy the flying robot!   And don't get me started on the whole time line/destiny/paradox question that his movie raises.  You know, if these machines were smarter than than are depicted, why can't they just keep sending more machines to take out either Sarah or John Connor?  If they can travel back in time, they can keep on doing it.  I'm sure they can get lucky at least once and end it.  Or why don't they take out John's father instead of Sarah.  If I was them, I would have taken him out before he even had a chance to go back to protect Sarah in the first one.   Anyway, the movie ended on a downer.  I guess it was trying to say that you can't change your destiny.  I'm sure there will be a fourth Terminator movie!  Oh, by the way, I was just reading Yahoo.  Apparently the  urlLink French want to ban the word "e-mail"  from their vocabulary.  I swear we are going to hell in an hand basket!

      It's been a while since I last blogged.  Been busy at work, with softball, and going out with Loreley.    We played our last season game on Saturday night.  It was supposed to be a double-header but one team forfeited the game!  We won the second game by the score of 22 to 9, and I went 1 for 2.  Actually, I was beginning to feel like the weak link of the team.  There was a moment of the game when I just felt like I was anyway.  I was on second and the guy at the plate hit the ball into the outfield.  I was running around third when I saw that the ball was thrown to the catcher.  I tried sliding into home feet first but my foot got stuck, and came in on my knees, but I was safe.  However, it looked like to the other team that I was trying to bowl over the catcher.  They made a little stink about it.  Even the guys on my team were telling me to slide the right way next time.  I WAS TRYING TO SLIDE THE RIGHT WAY!  I just suck at doing it!  Anyway, the playoffs start this Friday!  Nothing new on the house plans.  I've been talking to a few subcontractors to see what they can do for me.  Right now, it looks as though that I probably start on the building phase in September.  I only hope so!  Things with Loreley and I are going great!  She is great!  Every time I'm with her, I find out more that we have so much in common.  The other day, we decided to make it official in being exclusive.  It gets better because I found out she knows Karma Sutra!!!!! ;0

       Anniverserys!   It is my parent's 26th Anniversery today!  It's very hard to find people that have been married that long!  I don't know if they have plans but I think they may come out to watch me play softball tonight.  I also had a softball game last night.  We won, the score being 17 to 10.  I went 2 for 2.  I asked Loreley to come to tonight's game since I haven't seen her since Friday.

      So I was watching MTV last night and watched the show  urlLink Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica .  It's about the lives and marriage of Nick Lahey (98 degrees fame) and Jessica Simpson (also another singer).  Personally I have to laugh at Jessica Simpson after watching the first two episodes!  After seeing her in her private life, you get the feeling that she is just a spoiled, whiny, brat!  In the first episode, she tells the audience that she was spoiled growing up and had people do things for her.  I didn't doubt it after seeing that she didn't even know how to do laundry!!!  I mean she had all their clothes in the middle of the floor, she is just looking around and doesn't know what to do!  She then whines that she needs a maid to Nick....which by the way...I have to say I have to admire the guy for putting up with her! However, last night's episode gets better!  Nick is suppose to go on tour and he is auditioning some dancers.  However, Jessica is whining about this and she has to rush over to the studio to watch him do the auditions.  She goes into on what she would do if she finds him cheating, saying that she would blow off (with a gun mind you) his member!!!  So, she decides her solution to keep her man is to go to a lingerie shop to get some sexy underwhere.  BUT....when she buys a couple of pairs and walks out of the store, she realizes (without even looking at the price tag on them) that the few pieces of lingerie cost over 700 dollars!!!  She then has to call Nick and tell him what happens, saying that she never looked at the price tag and she can't return them, you see Nick just shaking his head over her stupidity!  Come on!!!  I mean 700 dollars for lingerie without even looking at the price tag.....DUMBASS!!!  Anyway, I honestly think that this marriage will only last a few years.  I don't know what Nick saw in Jessica except that she is beautiful and sexy.....or that fact that was a virgin when they got married!  The guy has to be a saint to put up with her whining and ignorance!  MY GOD!!!    Makes me glad that I know how to do laundry!

      So last night, I went to see  American Wedding  last night with Loreley.  I was actually worried that Loreley wouldn't like it because she hasn't seen the first two.  I was going to suggest seeing  Tomb Raider, Cradle of Life  but that actually ended it's run on Thursday night.  Anyway, she said she wanted to see it so I was lucky!  I ran into my cousin Dee at K-mart before meeting Loreley after work.  She said that she saw it a week earlier and said it was great!   After seeing the movie.....I thought it was hilarious!  I know a few scenes had me crying from laughing so hard.  Those two scenes that got me were the bachelor party with the strippers and the scene with the "chocolate truffle".  If you saw it, you know what I mean but I don't want to give it away to those who didn't.   However, I do say that I'm disappointed in a couple of things.  First they didn't mention why the characters played by Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klien, Mena Suvari, and Tara Reid weren't at the wedding.  I mean if they were such great friends, wouldn't they have come or given a reason why they didn't come.   Secondly, Thomas Ian Nichols didn't have much of a part in this movie either.  He was the one who was with Tara Reid in the first movie.  I'm asking myself what's the point to have him if he doesn't have much of a part in the movie.  It was all about Stifler trying to bang the sister to Hannigan's (One time at band camp....) character and he still gets her, which I'm confused on how!  You mean to tell me that one act of sympathy can help any guy bag any girl?   Overall I give the movie a raving A!  I'm kind of disappointed that this might be the last in the "American Pie" series but it was a good send off.

      So below is the hell I designed.  A few are a no-brainer!  Can you blame me?  The one I added is Miss Cleo, the Tarot Card Reader from tv.  I can't stand her!  She's a demon of hell!!!  However, I have to say that the New York Yankess are more evil than Miss Cleo!  Anyway, last night was the first game of our company softball team.  We didn't practice at all coming into the game.  Most of the people we had from last year are gone.  One guy left altogether, two guys couldn't come, and two of the girls we had last year can't play this year because both of them are pregnant.  I began to think that this is going to be a bad year. However, when we started playing, we didn't look too bad!  We held our own until the fifth inning, when we were up by the score of 6 to 5.  They scored several runs, though we almost came back on our own but lost in the end by the score of 10 to 8.  I myself, went 1 for 3 with a walk.  I think all the playing I got from playing with my church team helped.    My parents are going to Kings Dominion today with my aunt and two cousins.  I wanted to go!!!  However, I went to Busch Gardens last week and I have to work today!  Some news on my house.  Things are going slowly.  It's now believed that I won't be able to break ground until October or November.  The reason....well, I have to get a construction loan from the bank and my father says that usually takes a month.  Once I have that squared away, I have to find a way to move the trailer that lies on where I'm building.  Apparently that also takes awhile too!  If it wasn't raining so much over the spring and early summer, I'm sure things would be close to finishing with my house.  A pain in the ass, I tell you!

      So on Wednesday, I had some family from Massachusetts come down to spend a few days with me and my folks.  They included my dad's aunt Dot, her son Gowie and his daughter Jenna, my second cousins Rachel and Justin, and Justin's daughter Jada.  Gowie and Jenna came down a few years ago, but the others haven't been down before!  We made plans to go to   urlLink Busch Gardens  down in Williamsburg, Virginia.  We started out with the six family members that I described above, my father, my girlfriend Loreley, and we meet my Uncle Jeff, his daughter Erica and her three friends along the way down there.  We first went by Water Country, which is a few miles down the road from Busch Gardens, to drop off Jeff, Erica, her three friends, Justin, Jada, and Rachel there.  We then drove over to Busch Gardens, where we got our tickets and went into the park.  My father then took Dot to see my  grandmother Jenny (her sister she hasn't seen in years) in Newport News, which was twenty minutes away.  My dad eventually made it back to Busch Gardens and meet him later.  So Gowie, Jenna, Loreley and I started out in Busch Gardens going to ride "The Loch Ness Monster" in the England/Scotland area.  I always make this the first ride I go on since it was the first rollar coaster that I rode on that went up-side-down!  However, Gowie and Jenna were apprehensive going on it and didn't go.  After Loreley and I rode the ride, I became the leader of the group and took them through Ireland and over to France, where we rode the "Le Mans", the racecar track.  The lines weren't too bad for that day since it was a weekday!  It took us about 30 minutes in line waiting.  After finishing the racetrack, we meet my dad in Germany to eat lunch.  After finishing lunch, I resumed my position as leader and took them over to the "Big Bad Wolf".  Again, Gowie and Jenna were apprehensive about the ride, asking me if it had loops or bid drops.  I said no to both, but I was only half right.  If you ever riden on that ride, it has a huge drop near the end that comes close to river.  They warned me if I lied, I get beat up.  Luckily, they both had a good time on it.  After that, we rode the "Katapult".  We then left for Italy.  We decided to ride the "Roman Rapids" to cool off.  The line for that took about an hour since everyone else need to cool off!  Both Loreley and I were the two wettest of the bunch after finishing.  We then went over to the new ride, "Apollo's Chariot".  Only my father, Loreley and I had the courage to go on it, but was it worth it.  It's been a long time since I had a ride that gave me the thrills and shortness of breath that I had.  When you sit down in the ride, the seat is designed so that your legs are dangling.  The only thing holding you in your seat is what looks like one of those plastic safety bouys that lifeguards carry around with them.  It didn't have any loops but the drops were huge and with the seat, it made you feel weightless!  After that ride, Loreley and I rode "Da Vinci's Cradle", while my father took Gowie and Jenna to ride the "Da Vinci's flying machine".  After finishing, we went to ride "Escape from Pompeii".  We then went back to where we started on the "Loch Ness" in Scotland.  This time my father convinced both Gowie and Jenna to go it.  When they got off, they apparently enjoyed it!  We then proceeded back over to Germany where my father took Gowie and Jenna to ride the "Big Bad Wolf" while Loreley and I rode the "Alpengiest".  We then meet them back for ice cream.  I got the only thing that I really wanted from this trip....A FUNNEL CAKE!!!!  MMMmmmm....tasty!  After finishing, we then took the sky carts back over to Italy for the last hour of our day to ride "Apollo's Chariot" again.  However, Gowie and Jenna didn't want to ride that this time!  It was actually better the second time!  We then decided to leave the park to go back and meet everyone else at Water Country.  When we got there, we meet everyone at the hotel of the entrance of Water Country.  There, we ran into my grandmother Jenny and her boyfriend Greg.  My great aunt Dot had spent the day with her but my grandmother wanted to meet everyone before they went back up to Massachusetts.  She also wanted to meet Loreley!  I have to say that the meeting went well!!!  After about 45 minutes, we headed for home.  We didnt' get back until 10:30 last night.

      So I was watching the movie  Flight of the Navigator  last night.  If you remember, it was one of those Disney movies that they made in the 80's as part of their weekly movies!  Of course you would remember it...it was about a 12 year old kid that is transported 8 years into the future by a mechanical alien and his cool spaceship.  At the time, I thought it would have been cool to be a Navigator.  It starred a young Sarah Jessica Parker, the alien was voiced by Paul Ruebins...aka...Pee Wee Herman,  and the kid was named Joey Cramer.   Anyway, it hits me this morning to find out about this kid Joey.  I asked myself, what did he do other than this movie?  I was shocked to know that he only did two other movies.  One was called  Runaway , which sets place in the future where we have robots to help with work.  It started Tom Selleck and Gene Simmons.  Man, Gene is even scarier without his makeup on when he plays with KISS.  The other movie that Joey Cramer stared in was with Buddy Ebson...aka...from the "Beverly Hillbillies".  I don't remember what it was called.   Well, anyway, it's like the kid just fell off the face of the earth after that movie.  I couldn't find any biographical informatiion on him after that.  I keep seeing all this child actors that I remember from my childhood and wonder where the hell are they now!!!  Maybe he'll turn up on VH1 on that "Where Are They Now!" series!  I would love to just write to these kids now and see what they are doing!  Anyway....WHERE'S JOEY CRAMER NOW????

      The last two days have been a bit unusal for me!  It started yesterday morning, when for some odd reason, I locked myself out of my house when I just about to leave for work.  I realized that I left my keys in the house when I got into the car.  I looked all around the house to see if any of the doors or windows were unlocked.  The very last window that I checked, it was unlocked but I had to get the screen off it first.  I had to poke two holes in the screen to get it unlocked.  Then after opening the window, I had to fall into the living room.  I must have looked like an idiot.  At work, before lunch time, my co-worker, Dana, was looking at the paper and found a yard sale just up the road from where I work.  Dana is what you call an "expert yardsaler".  She talks about going to all these yardsales and finding all these deals on clothes and other stuff.  She knows that I'm looking to get some stuff when I finish my house so she asked me if I wanted to come with her.  I told her yes and we went there on our lunchbreak.  We didn't find anything though. However, on the way back, we saw a funny site!  We passed an old Chevy Chevette going 35 mph up 29 North (the speed limit is 55).  As Dana passed it, we see the guy driving with an WWII American Army helmet.  Dana, at that point, just busted out laughing and I couldn't help but laugh with her.  It's one of those "you had to been there" stories.  After work, we had our last game for our church softball team.  It wouldn't have been our last but this was the playoffs and it was a double elimination and this was our second lost.  I had to come in at third base because our usual third baseman injured himself the day before when he was doing yardwork.  So this was my first time at third base.....and I think it was my last.  A couple of times the ball came right at me from the hitter and I seemed to block the ball with my body.  I got hit in the shin and the shoulder and left bruises on both.  Anyway, we finished this year second in our division but weren't able to get to the championships.  Better luck next year.  Besides, I'm playing on my company team this fall!  Today, I got up early to go to yardsales with my mom and grandmother and a couple of cousins.  I bought a few things, including a couple of books, a glass marble chess board that I'll probably give my father for Christmas, a movie "Lion King 2: Simba's Pride" for my father's collection, and Legos!!! Yes, I got legos.  Most of them are Star Wars Legos and that's why I bought them.  I found out that a few pieces are missing so I could finish a few items!  Shucks!  After going to a couple of yardsales, we went to McDonalds for breakfast.  After leaving, I saw and waved to my friend Kelly who if I remember correctly was going on date either last night or today!  Kelly...I hope you have or had a good time on your date????!!!  We also stopped a produce stand to get some fruits that my grandmother wanted.  While there, I ran into a family friend, Nan Hutcherson.  I went to school with her daughter Michelle and Nan was always a riot.  I will be leaving soon to go to a cookout tonight.  A couple from church invited all the young adults from bible study to the cookout so I decided to go with girlfriend Loreley.  Should be interesting!  If so, I will write more about it tomorrow!

       WA HOO WA!!!   My Virginia Caviliers won a close one today.  They played Wake Forest.  By the fourth quarter, it looked like the Hoo's were losing.  In the last 3 minutes of the game, they were down 24 to 21.  In those last few minutes, they got in close enough to let the Virginia kicker kick a 53 yard field goal to tie Wake Forest.  I was shouting and hollaring so much my mother had to come down and ask what was wrong.  I told her and she said I was crazy!!! Anyway, Wake got the ball after that and after a couple of plays, Virginia got an sack to give them 4th and 2.  They tried to go for it but Virginia stopped them.  Then it was Virginia's turn.  In the last minute, they went down the field.  Around the last 15 seconds of the game, they kicked another field goal to go ahead 27 to 24!!!!  I was so f*&king happy that I was creaming in my pants.....figuratively speaking.  It in those last 10 seconds of the game was I was hoping that Virginia wouldn't caugh up the game so I was holding my breathe and crossing my fingers.  When on the last play, Wake dropped the ball and my Virginia Cav's won the game.  I was so excited that I was jumping up and down on my couch yelling!!!  I heard my father too!  Anyway, that was my excitement for today.  I didn't catch the first half of the game because I went up to my property to dig open the septic tank.  My god that was scary when we opened it up.  Apparently, in the fifteen years that my uncle lived there, he never flushed out the septic tank!!!  EWWWWW!!!

      So last night we played a double header on my company softball team.  We lost both!!!  We suck!  I didn't do so great offensively, going 0 for 2 in the first game and 0 for 1 in the second game.  However, defensively I was great.  I caught a pop fly while I was in the outfield and at another time, I gunned down the runner at second to get an out.  So all in all, our record is now 0 and 6, with only 4 more games to go.

      Are there times in which you feel that you can save the world by yourself?  Times in which you alone can be the savior of the entire planet.  Where you can move the masses to decide to say in one loud voice, "YES....we are one and we will not fall!"  Times in which you feel like the mighty Atlas and hold the world upon your shoulders.  You are the savior...you are salvation....only you can save this world from the abyss of despair. And yet, are there are times that you say to hell with this world.  When you wish that the hand of God would just wipe out our entire civilization in one swoop.  That we are too far gone for redemption.  That our sins are too heavy to even pass on to the next generation.   The time in which there lies no distinct line between what we call good and evil.  Sinners and saints hold on to and walk the same ground.  We are caught in between time.   The funny thing is I find it difficult to distinguish either at the moment.

      Ok....so we didn't have a hurricane party at my place!!!  But we did survive it!  Well, not completely.  A tree fell on my deck and damage a piece of the railing.  That's it.  Saturday, we spent the morning working on clearing and marking the area to build my house.  Man, it looks small!!!  We didn't do much after that since my father wasn't feeling well!  Sunday, it was Loreley's and I's third month of dating anniversery.  Hey, it's a big deal to me since I had one other relationship that last this long but only for five months.  Besides, to me, I consider 1, 2, 3, 6 months and 1 year a real celebratory thing in a relationship.  Six months will the be the big one for me!!!  Anyway, I wanted to at least plan something for it so I thought about taken her out to lunch.....someplace that doesn't take 1 minute to get your food from.  I was hoping to take her to The Woodgrill Buffet but that was packed because most people were still without electricity.  So instead, I took her to Cici's Pizza.  It's a good thing that she's not picky!  Besides she said it was alright but you can be too sure when women say that.  After lunch, I took her to see "Underworld".  I can't say much about it because I was too bored when I watched it.  I have to say it's an interesting story but I couldn't get into it.  I don't think Loreley did either.  After the movie, I thought I had a softball game scheduled.  We went to the field only to find that a co-worker of mine, Chris, and his girlfriend Christy, were the only one's there.  I didn't find out until after I got back home that it was cancelled because the other games were cancelled due the lack of electricity.  BUT IT WAS SUNNY OUTSIDE!!!  Anyway, the three of us practiced and Loreley watched from bleachers.  I felt bad since what I was hoping for that day didn't even remotely come to pass for us.  She was tired so I told her to go and get some sleep.  Today was pandemonium at work.  I think the IT department had it worst.  The system was still down this morning and everybody was getting pissed.  But to top it off today, I get an IM from somebody that I least expected it from!  I haven't heard from her in about over a year even though I do see her occasionally on AIM.  However, with our history, I never expected to hear from her again!  But it did make my day to  hear from her.

In January of 1999, I went on a class trip to Andros Island in the Bahamas for two weeks 86.  It was arguably the best time I went to anywhere even though the place I stayed at was shitty 87.

      I wrote a entry on Sunday but I think Blogger ate it!  Anyway, this is my recap of my weekend.  On Friday, after work, Loreley came over to have dinner with us and watch "Hijinx", the movie that my friend made of us in college.  After the movie, we talked about our relationship.  I found out that she is also scared about getting close to me knowing that she might leave next year.  That is why she tells me she hasn't told me she loves me.  She asked if that bothered me and I said no, it didn't, because I understand that some people have a hard time saying it or don't know how to say it.  I'm not pressuring her to say it anyway.  This is just so frustrating though since we don't get to spend much time with each other since I make her focus on her school and work.  On Saturday, I went up to my property to do some work.  My father and I started by putting locks on the shed so we wouldn't have to worry about people getting in to the tools.  We then cleared out a hundred feet of barb wire fence and bushes so it would be easier to allow my uncle clear the land when he started.  It was raining so we left at 1 since we couldn't get anything else done that day.  We then went to go see my Uncle and told him what we did and he tells us that we have to put it back because there are cows back there!  WHAT!!!!  He told us to talk to the neighbor because she sometimes has cows back there.  Now he tells us.  Anyway, we went to talk to the neighbor but luckily for us, she didn't have any cows since she sold them last year because of the drought.  Anyway, I was just glad we didn't have to put back the barb wire fence.  Sunday, after church, we went to Orange to check out a bedroom suit and kitchen table for my house.  My mom had put an ad in the Bucksaver to advertise for a bedroom suit for my house and we recieved a call from a woman in Orange on Saturday night.  So we went to Orange to check it out.  Oh my....this was some beautiful stuff!  The bedroom suit, which came from  urlLink Ethan Allen  orginially, including the  urlLink Sleigh bed , the  urlLink mattress , two  urlLink night tables  in cherry, and two table lamps for 700 dollars!!!  I also got a cherry framed table with green tile on it with four chairs for 350 dollars and nice Magnvox tv for 250 dollars!  Lets just say I got a great deal on all this stuff.  Last night after work, we went to pick this up from the woman and brought it back to my parents place.  I can't wait to finish my place and move in!

      Last night my company softball team played it's fourth game of the season.  We didn't look too good.  The other team scored 7 runs in the first inning.  By the time it finished, the final was 14 to 4!  That makes our record now 0 and 4!!!  Damn...we suck.  We made a lot of errors and the other team hit mostly up the middle bloopers.  We actually could have scored a couple of more runs but we didnt' have a third base coach to tell people to go home.  I'm the one has been doing the third base coach but I didn't since I was trying to keep the scorebook. On a brighter side...if you can call it that...my parents came to the game.  It's their first game to my company softball.  They wanted to meet everyone that I work with.  All my co-workers now know where I get my grin.....which I get from my mom. Well, they got to see probably one of my best games offensively since I started playing last year.  I was the designated hitter (DH) of the game, playing at the 12th position.  You can have 12 players hitting in the line up only if there are 6 girls and 6 guys.  I elected to be the DH to let another guy play in the outfield since he was new to the team.  I went for 2 for 2, a single in the 4 inning and a big shot to the outfield in the the 6th inning to give me a double.  I later heard that my mom was so excited for me that she was dancing and yelling in the bleechers!!! After the game, I introduced them to some of my co-workers.  They all seemed to like them.  After they left, the rest of the team decided to go to BW3 but I decided not to since I'm trying to save my money for the house.  Well, after hearing about this morning, I'm kicking myself in the ass for not going.  All of them had a good time, got drunk, had a lot of conversations, and even a few stayed till midnight.  I'm promising myself that next time they go, I'm going!  I also signed up for a Live Journal account last night.  My friend, who has a website called,  urlLink Muppethouse , is setting up Live Journal accounts for anybody who wants one.  I thought it was pretty cool of him to do so but I have to figure out what I'm going to design on this new journal.  I'll keep you informed about the new journal when I set it up.  Also heard this morning that both Johnny Cash and John Ritter died!  Now I would have expected Cash to die since he was 71 years old.  I figured since his wife, June Carter Cash, died 6 months ago, he would go soon too since I hear that couples that stay together for that long usually die one right after another.  But John Ritter....that was a complete shock.  Everybody knows him as Jack Tripper from  Three's Company , which I always enjoyed watching, and he was only 54.  I enjoyed the one show where there was a miscommunication with one of the roommates....that was the best one (yes...I'm being sarcastic here.  There was always a miscommunication)!  But it was just a sad thing to hear after you grow up on watching him.

       Some people are born mediocre, some people achieve mediocrity, and some people have mediocrity thrust upon them.   Joseph Heller (1923 - ), "Catch-22"   Lately, I've been realizing that one of the things I fear is being mediocre.  Actually, the truth is that I don't ming being mediocre in my eyes, but I'm afraid to be mediocre in the eyes of my family and friends.  Does that sound at all a bit strange to you?  Now, I constantly hear from my family how special and wonderful I am, but aren't most families suppose to say that.  It's a strange feeling to worry that everything you hear about yourself is not true.  From what I hear, I should be glad to have such a positive environment to grow up in.  But I still worry that it is not enough for me anymore. I worry that friends only see me as a mediocre friend.  They say it in words but never actions.  I just want to be told that I can be a great friend, or a best friend or even a good friend.  I worry that as time goes on, I won't be remembered much as a friend as those who I call friends move on with their lives. I worry about being a mediocre boyfriend.  Will I be remembered at all by those that I dated and/or loved.  Will I be just another scratch on the wall, just another guy that she dated, just a memory that is only stirred when someone asks her "Oh, whatever happened to him?"   Or being remembered as a mediocre lover.  Someone that you don't remember how it was when you kissed him.  Someone that you said was just not that memorable when you slept with him.  I wonder would she ever think about me at night when she was in bed with her new boyfriend or lover or husband?   In turn, I worry about being a mediocre husband whose wife wished for that old flame again or felt trapped by the bonds of marriage or kids.  Does she think of him late at night when she is beside me?  Do I ignite the passion that we felt when we first dated or is it just a tiny candle in our lives?  I guess mediocrity can be a scary feeling.  Maybe this could be the reason for our wanting to be on top of the world, to be the best of what we can be.  Would the world be a better place if we just strived to be mediocre?

      ”It is better to have loved and lost than never to have lost at all.”  Samuel Butler, The Way of All Flesh, Chapter 77  That quote seems to sum it up for me.  On Friday, after I had dinner with Loreley, I came out and told her that I loved her.  I was debating to say it because I was truly scared of that feeling of loving her.  The reason....she wants to transfer to another school once she finishes at the local community college, Piedmont.  She says that she doesn’t want to stay in Virginia anymore and she wants to get out and travel.  She doesn’t want to settle here.  She’s been looking at colleges in California, Chicago, and Ohio to name a few.  So I’ve been asking myself, what’s the point of loving someone when you know they are going to leave in a year/year in a half?  What’s the point of getting close to someone when you know it will only break your heart when you know they are going to leave.  Hey, things can change between now and that point.  She may decide to stay in the state.  But somehow I don’t believe it.  She’s only 19 and she wants to do so many things before she “settles down”.  So what did she say when I told her those three words?  Well, she gave me that deep look she gives, smiled and told me that she was happy to know that I felt that way, and gave me a big hug.  She didn’t reply back with those words, though I won’t push her to say them.  Maybe she hasn’t gotten to that point yet in our relationship.  I’ve heard that there are some people who can’t even say them and may never say them.  With her, it’s hard to tell how she feels.  I can only assume that I make her happy enough to stay with me.  I realize how love can be one of the scariest things in this world.  It comes easy to me when I say “I love you” to my family and friends.  However, when it comes to being in love, it’s much more difficult to say.  Other than Loreley, I can honestly say that I’ve only been in love with one other person, which I considered my first love.  Yet, you can never fall out of love with that person that easily.  You just move on until you find someone else to love, but you never forget it.    When I told her I loved her, Loreley asked me why.  I told her that I feel empty, that empty feeling in your stomach when she’s not around and when I do see her, I have butterflies in my stomach in the excitement in seeing her every time again.  I don’t know if she felt that I was genuine when I told her.  I can only wonder if that was how she felt with her previous love, whom she almost married.  Love can be frustrating and wonderful.  Yet how can you define it, feel it, make it true?  That’s why love can be the scariest thing in the world.   So what Samuel Butler says true in that it's better to love than never at all?

      Life….or something like it!  Here’s a basic recap of my Labor Day weekend!  It started on Thursday night after work when we played a double header in my company softball team.  I’ll just give you a basic gist of it…..we lost both of them!  I actually didn’t do so bad….but that’s because I was a sub for both games.  When I did come in, I went 1 for 1 in the first game and 1 for 2 in the second game.  We are now 0 and 3 in the standings!  When I got home that night, I learned that my uncle and aunt were planning to move out of the trailer….that lies on my property of where I’m building.  The plan was that I build on the spot where the trailer is but they live in it now since they are building a house for themselves.  I didn’t want to push them out but they knew that I wanted to start soon.  Anyway, with the news that they were moving out over the weekend, my folks were in a rush to find out some way to get the trailer off the land.  The original plan was that my father found someone to take it to use as a hunting trailer but found another one a couple of weeks ago.  So my folks, especially my mom, who was trying to help me on this, started looking up numbers to give away the house.  I was helping her looking up numbers and all of sudden she was bitching on how we have to do this now!!!  I am just there reading the numbers in the phone book when she did this so I started shouting back feeling that she unjustly bitched at me, and all of a sudden it was a shouting match between her and I.  For those that know her, and me, we never argue about anything in way like this before so it was an unusual outbreak of emotions between the two of us.  However, we calmed down to finishing looking up numbers.  Friday, after I got off work, I came back home.  I found out my mom had called around about getting rid of the trailer but only found that would cost me $1200 to get a guy to come and take it away.  I was feeling the pressure on me at this point but it then that my mom got a call from my uncle….the same one that I bought the land from….found someone to take the trailer away for FREE!!!!  I was so relieved to hear that.    Saturday morning, I got up early to go help my uncle/aunt to pack up and move out of the trailer.  But, when we got there, they moved most of the stuff out already.  I helped though move out the fridge and some large cabinets.  They moved all their stuff into the large shop that they have below where they are building!  Now, all that I have to do is wait until they move the trailer!  After helping, I left around 3 to come back home and get dressed to go out to dinner with Loreley.  Her mom came down from Ohio for the weekend and she wanted to meet her.  I was a bit nervous about it and I dressed up for them.  However, I seemed to have been overdressed because they dressed in shorts and t-shirts and I had on my Sunday best!  I meet them at the Kroger parking lot…where Loreley works.  It was Loreley, her mother, aunt, her grandmother, and her mother’s friend and we all got into the Suburban and went to dinner at the Outback.  I actually had a good time eating out with them.  After dinner, they drove back to Kroger and I said goodbye to her mother.  I think she liked me because she hugged me before leaving.  That is a good sign right?  On Sunday, I went to church that morning.  I ran into Loreley after the early service and she was heading out with her mom to Fredericksburg.  I went to my mom’s cousin house to have a birthday party for my aunt and uncle, who are twins, for their 42nd birthday.  On Monday, I was off from work because it was Labor Day.  I slept in that morning but decided to go town to go see Loreley at work to ask about going out after she got off.  We decided to go for a drive to Skyline after work around 2, so I went to Lowes to check about a sample of aluminum siding for the house that I need to get to compare for bricks I was getting for the house.  I then went to Loreley’s house to meet up with her.  We left around 2 and drove from Greene up to Skyline Drive.  We decided to stop and hike up Humpback rocks there but about half way up, it started to rain.  When we finally got back down, we were both drindged!  We decided to drive back to Charlottesville, where we decided to get ice cream at Kohr Bros.  I don’t know if that was such a good idea since we were still cold from the rain!  We then headed back to her house where I realized that my windows in my car were down and some rain poured.  Luckily, her parents were home and put towels on which I’m thankful for.  Hope everyone else had a good Labor Day!

       Is it the Beginning of the beginning or the end of the beginning?  So, two good things happened today.  First, I found my planning book which had everything for the house.  Apparently my father found it in one of the plastic containers that we use to carry tools around.  I was so relieved to hear that news. Secondly, I closed with the Mortgage company today.  I signed my life away and now I'm am a home owner.  Scary shit!!!  For the next 30 years, I will be paying for this house, give or take a few years! Just finished my costume.  I won't say what it is until tomorrow.  Hopefully some people we take a few pictures and I can send them out to anybody who would like to see.   Also finished working on the Master Scavenger list for my friends up in Northern Virgina.  I hope they have a fun time doing this tomorrow night.

       IF IT AIN'T ONE THING, IT'S SOMETHING ELSE   Yup, that's how it is with me lately.  Well, the good news is that I finally got my building permit today.  It's the one thing that's been holding me up from finally closing my mortgage papers, which I do so with the Closing Company tomorrow at 2.  After that, all I need to worry about is money and building.  My advice for all of you who are thinking about building a house....DON'T.  It's a pain in the ass.  Buy a house instead.  A lot less hassle with paperwork.    Bad news is that I lost my little white book with all my other paper work in it, such as the plans and other little tidbits of info on the house.  I think I might have left it at my property in the shed....which is locked.  But I don't know for certain until I go up Saturday.  AS for Halloween, well, I'm still working on my costume.  I won't say what I'm doing because a few people I know read this and will see me on Friday.  I have a company lunch on Friday and there is going to be a costume party and contest.  After work, I plan on eating dinner with Loreley but can't do much with her afterwards since she remembered on Monday that she has to usher for something at Piedmont Friday and Saturday night.  I'm so frustrated that I don't get to see her but for a few hours for a few days at a time.  Anyway, after I eat dinner with her, I'm probably going to a party thrown by a co-worker.    I'm also in charge of compiling a list of items for a scanvenger hunt for my friends up in Northern Virginia on Halloween.  I'm disappointed that I can participate in it but I'm glad to help with the list though.  I have to select a few items from each person's list of items that they send me and I will compile them into one big master list and send it back to them on Friday.  Anybody have any ideas on what to look for on a Scavenger hunt?

      I admit it....I have an addiction.  I can't help but watch "I love the 80's" on VH1.  How could you not remember the great toys, the aweful fashions, and those unusual fads.  But was your favorite thing from the 80's?

       I feel like an adult now!   So Loreley and I were invited over for dinner by one of my co-workers,  urlLink Rachel  , on Friday night at her place.  They, Rachel and her husband Chris, cooked us dinner which was French Bread Pizza and talked.  After dinner, we sat down to watch "The Mummy", which I brought over from my collection since Rachel never saw it before.  After the movie ended, we played a card game (which the name I can't remember) that entailed inflicting damage on another player by laying down cards like kicking, punching, and upper cutting those that you wanted to hurt.  I was the one who got most of the damage.  Why does everyone want to hurt me????  Anyway, I had a great time with them.  However, I have to say that I feel......grown up!!!  I know it sounds funny but this is the first time that I have had a relationship and had a dinner over at another couple's place.  It's what a mature grown up would do, right?  On Saturday, we went up to help my uncle out putting windows in his house.  We couldn't do much on my property since they were going to move the trailer early Sunday morning.  I did find out that the Electric company finally rolled back the service lines so I can now have a cement truck come up without snagging the line.  Now I have to worry about getting the Building permit, which is suppose to take 10 to 14 days, but it's been almost 4 weeks now.  I'm going to go by the county office building tomorrow and check.  They are royally pissing me off.  Last night, Loreley called to ask me if I wanted to go to Kings Dominon today after church.  I told her I was broke, which is true, and tired from Saturday.  She left just after the early service ended.  I really wanted to go too.  After going to Wal-mart after church, I called to see the progress of the trailer being moved.  The good news is that they got it off the land....bad news is that the piece they were hauling it with broke so that have it at my uncle's shop now.  I'm just glad they finally moved it.  Well, it shouldn't be my problem now, right?

      "Slap my ass and call me Shirley!"  Seriously, I have to ask, do you ever feel like you always get what you need but never what you really want?   There's that one thing that you want so desperately and everytime you come close to getting it, it's taken away from you as quickly.  The real kicker is that it may seem so insignificant and you wonder why you want it in the first place?

      It’s been a long few days since I last wrote.  I guess I’ll give you the rundown:   Thursday:   I was informed that I couldn’t blog at work anymore.  That’s what my supervisor told me.  I don’t get to blog much at home so I won’t be able to write much.    We had another company softball game after work.  It was our second to last game.  We lost!  After the game though, most of us went out to Buffalo Wild Wings to just relax and hang out.  They went last week but I didn’t get a chance to go.  I actually enjoyed myself hanging with them since I don’t get to do so.   Friday:   I nearly panicked at work when the Closing Company called to say that they neededhe paper work they sent me on Monday by email to be faxed to them that day.  Apparently if I didn’t, I couldn’t close next Tuesday.  I had so many calls to make because of that, I got in trouble at work again.  I’m not going into details but I will say that I got in trouble over the damn house plans.   I thought I was going to go out with or do something with Loreley Friday night but her mom came down from Ohio to visit it.  So I was extremely agitated over that.  I just came home to watch the Cubs/Marlins game.   Saturday:   I went up to work on my property.  That morning, we just did a few things around the property like pulling some barb wire and brush away.  Didn’t expect to do much with the trailer that’s still there.  However, we left to go help my uncle work on his house, but he didn’t need any work.   Instead, a couple of guys that I know came over to work on getting wheels on the trailer to move.  It was an extremely hard job to do because we had to use a bulldozer to lift the trailer, to put the wheels on and to remove the cement blocks that were under the trailer to hold it up.  I took three hours to put all six wheels on.  However, they couldn’t move it that day.   Sunday:   After church, Loreley and I went to Cici’s to have pizza.  While there, we ran into a few people from church and had lunch with them.  We then left and went up to the Suger Hollow Reservoir and walked along the river bed.  I then took Loreley to my property to show her the progress.  They didn’t move the trailer like I was hoping they would. After that, we headed back to town so I could play my last softball game of the season.  When we got there, we learned that we were one woman short for the necessary five needed to play.  However, Loreley actually decided to come in and play with us!  I was so glad that she did.  Anyway, we lost!!!  Enough said.  Well, I could say that we had a perfect season…..a perfect losing season.  I actually did well by going for 2 for 2 and caught several fly balls!  Oh well, there’s always next year!

       CURRENT EVENTS   Let’s see what’s going on these days in national and world news.   Arnold winning the California election.   Besides the fact that he won, which I don’t mind, it’s the fact of this recall that worries me so.  Will this set a precedent?  In the future will we as a country decide if we don’t like how our leaders do, will we go and recall them just to see if it’s popular and decide on who would be a better leader.  It was a spectacle in California!  Do we really want this sort of electoral process nationally?   Iraq   Didn’t want it but did see a threat in Hussein.  We should have removed him in the last war but that probably would have caused the same problems that we have back then.  You have to ask yourself, would you want to have one powerful leader in a self contained country or many volatile leaders going at it and probably disrupting not only the whole country but the whole region.  Still, we have troops over there, which I support, but I would like to see come home even if it means allowing other countries to support Iraq.   The World Series   Personally, I am an Altanta Braves fan.  However, I do like to see the Chicago Cubs and Boston Redsoxs in it.  I would be a great series to see one of them win after such a long draught.  However, I hate the Yankees!!!!  I don’t mind whoever goes but I don’t want to see the Yankee’s win!    China in Space   Ok, they are about to send their people in space now.  It would make them the third country in history to do so, behind Russia and the US.  They want to go to the moon too.  I’m kind of surprised that the US doesn’t really care about this.  I figured this would start another space race like we had we the Soviet Union.  Is there a saying that says who ever controls the high road, controls the field....or something like that.  I guess we are just licking our wounds with the Columbia disaster.  Next up....JEWS IN SPACE!!!!  Sorry, just a little Mel Brooks humor!   Roy mauled by tiger in Vegas   Now who is really surprised by this?  It was bound to happen after such a long time doing it.  I’m not saying he deserved this, but when you are dealing with wild creatures like tigers, you have to expect them to get feisty sometime.  I think the tiger was jealous of Siegfried taking up Roy’s time with him!!!  ;)

       Birthday dinner's and breaking ground   The weekend started out on Friday when I went to a birthday dinner for my girlfriend's father.  Before we left, I stopped at their place thinking that it was  a surprise for him.  However when I got there Glenda, his wife, accidently told him so the surprise was gone.  So, anyway, we all went out to a nice German restaurant in Madison called "The Bavarian Chef".  The only people that went with us was a couple from Church.   I actually got him a present for his birthday, which was a book called "The Purpose Driven Life".  He liked it and said that he was just about to get for himself.  On Saturday, I finally broke ground at my place.  My uncle started out by digging up the spot where I wanted to build.  Found out that there some huge boulders in some spots but nothing really big at where I was going to build.  I was estatic because we were worried that was going to be a problem.  Anyway, I hope to have the trailer moved out next weekend so they can put in the driveway up to the area.  Today, my company played our 8th softball game.  I won't go into the details.  Just know that we lost.....again!  We suck!

      Ok...the good news is that I found out that I haven't been screwed over.  I'm talking about the land that I bought from my uncle and my troubles with building my house.  We were thinking that the spot that I wanted to build at couldn't be built on because it was too rocky underneath.  However, my other uncle, who is my contractor, said it was ok to build on that spot.  But I swear, I was beginning to feel that this deal wasn't worth it.  It was already causing some strain among my family, and even between my parents.  Next time, I'm just buying a house instead!  So, I had to watch  urlLink Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica  last night on MTv.  I swear it's so funny to watch because you can't help but laugh at Jessica Simpson and feel sorry for Nick Lachey for being married to her.  Last night's episode, Jessica went away for a couple of days and Nick decides to decorate the house.  When she gets back, she is pissed off at him for doing so.  Her reasoning behind her anger.....well, she she wanted to hire a professional designer!  But get this, she tells Nick that she only wants to hire one because she doesn't know what the fashion is these days!!!  From what I saw, Nick seemed to have done a nice job decorating.  Why does she want to waste her money on a decorator when she has her husband?  My God!!!!  She whines too much about things that go what she expects even though she doesn't know what to do about it.  My odds are that Nick is going to get tired of her whining and divorce her in a couple of years!

       Through rain and shine, snow and wind….   No, this isn’t the Post office motto.  It was actually my Thanksgiving weekend.  It started on Thursday, Thanksgiving, by first cleaning around the house.  Nothing too special, but this year, we usually have a lot of food to cook.  In previous years, I would wake up to the smell of my parent’s cooking for that night when we have everybody over.  But not this year.  This year is different.  This year, I’m building my house! Like I said, we started the day by cleaning around the house.  However, we didn’t spend much of the day doing that at our house.  We left to go to my place to work on it before we went to Thanksgiving dinner at my aunt’s house just down the road.  We got to my place around 12.  I haven’t been to my property for over two weeks now because we haven’t had much to do.  I was surprised to get there to see that the foundation was up!  We started off by smoothing the ground inside the foundation to be ready to put on the floor joices.  After three hours using a pick and a shovel, I was getting worn out!  But by then, it was ready to go to my aunt’s and eat! Friday started off at the wee hours of 5:30 in the morning to get up and go work on my house.  I asked off from work to go and build my house.  I got up to find that it was raining a bit.  I thought it wasn’t good to work on a house in the rain, but we did anyway.  We got to my house around 7:30 while a light cold rain fell.  I’m building up in the Blue Ridge mountains so the temperature is about 15 to 20 degrees cooler than it is in the lower parts of the valley.  The sky was a dull gray and misty.  As I looked over to the other side of the mountains, the fog and mist rose like ghosts floating away from their graves.  We spent the day working on the floor beams on top of the foundation.  Throughout this time, the weather would change from a light misty rain, to stop, then pick up a little, get harder, stop, and then pick up again until it began to pour.  I had several articles of clothing and the only spot on my body that faced the elements was my face.  The combination of the cold and the rain stung my face at times.  We all were miserable, including my father who told me he could work in the snow but not the rain.  He complained to me that line several times.  Finally, around 3 o’clock that afternoon, we had enough and left.  However, we were soaking wet to point where our bodies were soaking wet after the rain soaked through our clothes. Saturday began the same way as Friday did, waking up at 5:30 in the morning.  However, it was raining.  The bad news was it was WINDY AND COLD!!!  Again, it’s a 15 to 20 degree difference in the mountains.  It was cloudy that morning to start off with.  It was so cold that there were snow flurries for about an hour that morning.  We finally got some sun and it warmed up a bit around 11 but we then had to face the wind.  It was so windy that it almost blew us off our feet at times. During the day, we were able to put on the floor of my house.  I know I spent the day moving all the wood and 4x4’s.  After about an hour of moving the wood, my arms got tired, but I kept going.  I told myself that the pain was good, the pain is my friend.  I never stopped or complained, but I’m paying for it today.  By 6, as the sun was setting, we were able to get to start on 2 of the walls of my house, though we didn’t put them up. I was glad that we didn’t have a light to finish or I would have died there from exhaustion.  The best part was that as we were putting all the equipment up to leave, I spilled gasoline all over myself!  I had to strip down before getting in truck and that was the most agonizing moment since it was so cold up there! Today, I could not get up to go to church.  I don’t how my folks did it but they went.  I woke up around 9, my whole body sore.  It was difficult to walk around but I soon got the ability to walk.  I got a call from my girlfriend telling me she got back from Ohio for Thanksgiving.  I won’t be able to do much with her the next two weeks since she has exams/tests to study for but I am meeting for dinner tomorrow.  Around 3, I decided to go into town to see the movie “Timeline”.  It was about archeology students going back in time to France in 1357.  Not really a great movie, though it had a lot of action, just not enough plot.

       Giving Thanks!   Well, in the spirit of the holiday, it's tradition to give thanks to the things in your life that you are thankful for.  I guess I am in that spirit now.  I want to share what I am thankful for:  1.  I'm thankful for my parents.  My parents have been a big help to me as of late, especially my father.  They've been a lot of help with the building of my house.  My father has taken charge and I feel lost without him.  My mom has given me a lot of support.  I'm sure that I could plan this house myself, but the job probably would never have been done right.  2.  I'm thankful for my friends.  I'm glad to have in my life the kind of friends that I have.  We may not talk or interact as much as most friends do, but I know that they are right there for me when I need and I for them.  There are a few that come to mind right now.  My friend  urlLink Rachel , who I have not known that long, but has offered her friendship to me these last few months.  I appreciate it.  My friend  urlLink Ginger , who these last few months has been extremely busy herself, but is right there when I need her.  She sent me an email today asking what I want I wanted for my birthday and Christmas.  I refused to tell her what I wanted but I know she is currently financially strapped and was about to move in with her boyfriend, who she is extremely happy with now!  There are other friends that I am thankful to have in my life but I just wanted to name a few.  3.  I'm am thankful for my girlfriend Loreley.  I can't say that our relationship is perfect or great but I am happy to have her in my life.  Our relationship is often a struggle because we deal with finding time to be togther (She goes to school and works and I have been focusing on the house) and some of our beliefs tend to clash.  However, overall, I am just happy to have her in my life.

       Current Thoughts   You ever get those moments when you have so much to talk about yet you don't know how to bring it out or no one to tell?  It's like a little dirty secret that someone tells you but you promised not to say anything to anybody.

      Last night, Loreley and I went over to Rachel's place.  She was having us over for pizza and to watch the  The Two Towers: The Extended Version .   Had a good time, the movie was over 3 and 1/2 hours.  I learned that Loreley has a thing for swords!  Don't really ask me about it!   I got up this morning believing that I was going up to work on my property.  Actually I got a day off since my father went up there yesterday to put some more silt fence and other things.  I found out that all the materials are up there now, including the brick, wood, and cement.  I think my uncle, who is my contractor, worked on the footings during the week.  So this week coming up, since I'm off on Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving, we may start putting up the walls! I have to give it to my dad though.  He has been working hard on my place.  I feel bad since I'm hourly where I work at, I don't get that luxery of getting the hours to get off.  I have enough for 5 days now, but I needed to give 2 weeks notice before I do, and with the Christmas season, it's been hectic at work.  Within my department, one of us has to be there.  So I have to give it to my dad in helping me so much with this.

       Virginity is Overrated!!   I wrote about the marriage seminar that I went to at my church in previous entries.  The subject that came up most was about our favorite word, SEX!  Yes, sex and marriage, both being talked about in church.  In the seminar, sex was one section of it.  Basically, what the discussion was having sex in the marriage and how males/females view it....or how men want it so much, but women don't.  It's funny to hear the excuses made for why women don't want it is because they are too tired working around the house.  If only the husbands were more responsive to the wive's feelings, if they helped out more around the house, then it would let the wives want more and enjoy sex more often!    YEAH, RIGHT!!!!  Well, I was talking about it in lunch today, to a couple of co-workers, two were guys (one of them was my supervisor), and two were women.  Both guys were saying that that way of thinking with husbands helping out wives would not help out in the bedroom.  It's not true!!!  Even the women agreed!  It means jack shit to women if the guy helps in whether or not he is getting lucky that night!   One guy even told me a theory of the marbles in the jar.  Apparently this theory is that in the first year of marriage, you put in a marble into the jar for every time you have sex.  Then after that year is up, you take a marble out every time you have sex from that time.  He said that the marbles that you put in would never be completely out of the jar throughout your marriage.   Anyway, that brings me back to my point of Virginity being overrated.  You often hear growing up, when going to church, to only have sex when you are married...to remain a virgin until that moment comes.  Apparently, it's special to be a virgin on your wedding night!  Maybe.....but does that mean that sex in the marriage is better.   I DON'T THINK SO!   What's the point when there is no guarantee that the sex is going last or even be good.  Sex is just like any part of the relationship when it comes to being with the significant other.  Would you knowingly marry someone that you know you would not be compatible with.  Sex is just as important in the relationship as having the same goals and dreams as the other person is.  So that is why I say virginity is overrated.  Go practice as much as you can before you get married but be responsible about it!

      Would you believe me when I say that my mother is already setting up christmas decorations!  We usually set them up right after Thanksgiving.  However, she believes that we will be too busy working on my house to do so this year!  Gee's....I can't wait to move out!  The Christmas music is driving me mad!!!!

      Loreley and I went to the marriage seminar last night at church.  I have to say that I really enjoyed it.  It was a two day seminar and I only expected to come to the Friday night part.  After getting out of it, I wanted to continue on Saturday, which was planned to last throughout most of the day.  However, on Saturdays, I've been either helping my uncle work on his house or work on my property to start building.  This morning, I asked my father if they needed my help.  I have this idea that my responsibility to help my uncle and work on my property comes before doing the marriage seminar.  Of course I didn't know if they needed my help since I've only been a gofor these last months.  I was surprised to hear him say it's really my decision.  So I decided to go the marriage seminar.   During the marriage seminar today, it started out with a part on the differences in communication in men and woman.  There was a moment during the discussion that lead to kissing your spouse as a form of communication.  We were all told to kiss each other (by that I mean our spouse/significant other) for about 10 seconds.  When this happened, everybody in the seminar was kissing except Loreley and I.  Why not us?  Well, I was still getting over my cold and sore throat and I didn't want to get her sick.  Poor me!!!    After that session, the men and women were seperated into groups.  The men discussed how we can be better husbands and that sort of thing.  When that finished, we stopped to have lunch.  It was at this point that Loreley had to go to work.  When I came back to the seminar after work, the next dicussion was on SEX in marriage.  This actually blew me away because we were actually talking about the subject in church of all places!  You tend to only hear about sex at church as a sin, but since it was in marriage, it was alright!    After that session, it was pretty much it.  Like I said before, I enjoyed it.  I'm not planning on getting married soon, but it does gives some insight on when I do....or if I do.

      I called my friend "C" a couple of nights ago because I haven't talked to her in at least four months.  She wasn't home so I left a message.  She lives in Northern Virginia so I don't get to see her that much. Well "C" calls back tonight but I am sadden to hear what has happened to her in the last few months.  Her biological father was sick for a long while and died last month.  She broke up with her boyfriend of three years who was constantly cheating on her.  She quit her job because she didn't enjoy it.  And to top it off, she told me she was in a car accident on October 21st.  She said she was still hurting from it and was sick tonight from it.  She is my friend and I love her and I hate not being there to comfort her.  I can only pray to God that he will look out for her.  I, myself, have been trying to get over a chest cold for the last few days.  My voice is hoarse and it has become very deep.  I've been joking with my co-workers that I wish I could sound like this all the time because I just sound so sexy....like Barry White.    I also think I have TMJ too.  Everytime I open my jaw, I get that popping feeling in my jaw.  My mom gets it bad so I think she past it down to me.  Damn heredity!!!  Tomorrow night, Loreley and I are going to a marriage conference/seminar at our church.  Now, I have to say that I'm not ready to get married, but I think it may help with reasons for getting married someday and I expect from it.   I thought it was unusal for Loreley to want to go since she is 19 and she says she not ready to marry.  She's been engaged before, but that only last a month.  She believes that she has too much to live for and see before she settles down.  I don't blame her.....I feel the same way about that too.  Anyway, if I learn anything from it, I'll keep you posted!

      Lately, I get pissed off when people say how nice I am or that I am such a good guy.  I don't know why that really pisses me off so much.  I shouldn't be.....I'm told I should be flattered when I'm told that.  I keep talking about it to some people and they tell me the same thing too.....that I should be flattered that I am.  I guess I'm just preoccupied with the whole bad boy/good guy image thing.  You know that one, where women date the bad boys because they are wild, crazy, and fun and they only want a nice good guy when they finally want to settle and marry.  I've actually been dumped by a girl who told me that I was just too nice and she only dated assholes and alcoholics.   Sometimes I want to be bad!  I want to ride a motorcycle....a harley...because they are cool.  I want to drive a fast car, a sports car, just because it's wild and crazy.  I want to be the life of the party and have all the hot chicks want to be with me!!! Oh, who the hell am I kidding.  I'm just a practical kind of guy.  I guess I should be happy to be such a nice guy, right?  You tell me.....you women.....what are the advantages/disadvantages of the nice/good guy?

       urlLink How well do you know me?   I found this site where you can make a test and see if people you know know you as well as you think.  Try it and see.  Weekend was pretty dull.  Worked on my uncle's house because my property isn't finshed being cleared.  I was a bit pissed off.  Came home later that night exhausted and went to bed at 10!  The next day, on Sunday, after church Loreley and I went to see "Matrix: Revolutions".  I didn't really enjoy it.  I really didn't understand it really.  Loreley was arguing with me that I couldn't understand it but it just didn't make much sense to me.  My boss got back from Las Vegas over the weekend.  He went there last week to go to the SEMA show.  Don't ask me what that is.  He brought me back a shot glass.  However, I don't know when I'll get to use it.  Also went to Best Buy after work and got me two new movies.  "Zardoz" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien".  I had to get "Zardoz" but that's what I named my journal after.  "Y Tu Mama Tambien" is a great Mexian movie that I saw earlie this year and I had to get it.

      So, Loreley and I went out to see "Brother Bear" tonight.  We wanted to see "Matrix: Revolutions" but that was sold out.  Anyway, it wasn't too bad!  Though it wasn't as good as "Finding Nemo", it was decent for a Disney movie.  The only bad thing is that there were a ton of screaming kids all around us! After the movie, we went to Best Buy!  The only reason I am telling you that is that Charlottesville just got one built and it opened today!  What a great place!  So much stuff that I wanted to get!  Pretty soon they will be putting in a Target!  Woo hoo!  Charlottesville is developing!!!!

       The spoils of   There are great advantages with working at an Automotive catalog company!  Just yesterday, the company was raffling off products that were taking up space in the sample room.  Each employee were given three raffle tickets and given products that matched the other half of the raffle ticket.  I got a Wax Orbital Buffer as one of my products!!!  But that's not all I got though.  Some people never came in to claim the raffles, so the people in charge said just take whatever you want that is left.  I was able to get some cool products! And today, they were selling some old products that never sold in the catalog.  They were selling them at 90% off to us!!!  So I go in, with a list of them in hand, and was able to get stuff that total about 750 dollars at usual cost for about 75 bucks!!!  Whooo hooo!!!  I got most of my Christmas shopping done!

       The weekend update.....even though it's Tuesday!   I've slacking on writing lately.  Anyway, I just wanted to say what I did for Halloween.  I dressed up like Homer Simpson.  I wore yellow makeup, made the big bulging eyes, and a mask for the mouth.  We had a contest at work, and everybody voted for either Funniest, Scariest, and Most Original costume.  I happen to lose by one vote for the Most Original.  I could have tied but I seem to have voted for someone else for Most Original and voted for myself for Funniest.  I could kick myself for that. As for that night, all I did was go over to a co-workers place for  a couple of hours.  I then planned on going to Buffalo Wild Wings, where a couple of coworkers were planning on going, but at the last second, I wasn't feeling very well because I needed to get the bald cap off my head and the make up off, since I had it on all day.  Well, yesterday I learned that they had the craziest time there so I'm kicking myself for not going.  Saturday was the usually working on something.  While my cousin Danny was still excavating my property, I worked on my uncle Willie's place.  Did some sanding and put oil on a bench that they found in the woods.  Was expecting to go to another Halloween party that my cousins were going too but was feeling sore after all sanding.  Again, I just keep finding excuses or reasons to not go!  Sunday, I went to church.  Afterwards, I went out on a Sunday drive with Loreley.  Spent most of the day just driving around Orange, Greene, and Louisa counties.  I actually got to see the town of Louisa for the first time in my life, and I have lived only 20 minutes away.

       Christmas Wishes and the New Year coming!   Well, I hope everyone had a good Christmas this year.  Mine as usual was nothing exciting.  For Christmas Eve, I went down to Newport News to my grandmother's place to have dinner with my dad's family.  Then for Christmas, we had dinner with my mom's family.  For Christmas, I received some clothes, a vacuum cleaner (for my house), a couple of DVD's, gift cards, and towels.  However, for my birthday, I did not get my wish, as the previous entry stated.  Oh well, maybe next year.  On that Friday after Christmas, I came to work but only 5 other people on my floor came to work.  I had to come since my co-worker, Dana, was off and we are the only two people who fax orders for the vendors.  It was a good thing though because my parents went up to my house and worked on it.  Speaking of which, by the end of Saturday, we finished putting all the plywood on the roof, the skylights in, putting tar sheets on the roof, and some of the brick around the house finished.  By today, the bricklayers finished the whole thing of putting all the bricks in.  On Sunday, after church, I went to see  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Ring .  It was incredible!  The battle scenes are amazing and epic.  I want to see it again.  I actually went to see it alone, because my girlfriend had to work on Sunday.  Funny story is that I didn't know that she had to work until the morning service was over with and I asked her what she wanted to do.  When she told me she had to work, I got the idea of racing to see the 11:45 showing of it and leaving to get tickets a few minutes of that.  I just raced into the fellowship hall, while she was eating brunch, told her I'm going to see the movie, and raced out while just hugging her and kissing her on the head.  Nice of me, right?  I found out a friend of mine just got engaged on Friday.  I'm so happy for her.  Another friend of mine is thinking about building a house with her boyfriend and is thinking about getting married too.  Everybody I know is getting engaged or married now!  I feel so left behind!  Someday......maybe!  I just like to say that I want to welcome my "complex yet intriguing" friend, if she is reading this.  ;)

      It's my 26th birthday today.  Yeah, whatever.  Nothing really exciting happens on my birthday anyway.  I did get milk duds from my co-worker, Dana!  I love the stuff!  I also got a little Star Wars Legos scene from my other co-worker Rachel.  Those two gifts made my day!  My girlfriend Loreley gave me a Star Wars book that I wanted the other day.  I got home from work just now to find that most of my family had called to wish me a Happy Birthday.  I'm glad to know that I wasn't forgotten though.  I have to say there's only one that I really want on my birthday.  BIRTHDAY SEX!!!!  I'm still waiting for that to come true!

       What's going on?   Ah, yes, what is going on.  I'll start with the house.  Yesterday, we started by moving all the trusses around for an hour.  Those were extremely heavy!  We got them all moved, we began to build one of the side walls.  After that, we worked on the interior walls for the bathroom and both bedrooms.  Once we finished those, we worked on the trusses.  Before I left, we were able to put up four of them.  When I left, I was going to get ready for my company Christmas dinner.  I had to go to my aunt's down the road to get ready (even though they weren't home) and went to pick up Loreley.  We got there near 7, chatted a bit with my co-workers, and then sat down at at table that included my friend Rachel and her husband,  My boss Jason and his, and Darryl who is also in the same department with me.  Dinner for me included grilled chicken, a couple of pieces of steak (small pieces), grilled patatos, and bread.   When everybody finished dinner, they called out door prizes.  I was the first one to win a prize, which was a 100 dollar gift certificate to The Aberdeen Barn!  I was disappointed because I didn't win the 300 dollar gift certificate to Best Buy!  We also had a gift swap for those employees that wanted to give something.  The gift I bought was a box of liquor filled chocolates, which Mark, the head of the Marketing Dept. picked up.  I got a rookie card of Sammy Sosa, which happened to be the gift that my boss Jason got.  Only four guys participated in the gift swap, so when we went up to get the gifts, Jason was telling me to get that particular gift! After the gift swap, people started to dance.  I actually danced myself....well not very well...but I did dance and I had a great time!!!!  Loreley was laughing at me because I didnt' have any rhythem!  She was in ballet so she loves to dance!  She was trying to teach me something, I think swing, for a while but I didn't have the right footwork!  The night ended around 10, when everybody was beginning to leave, and I took Loreley home.  Today, it's been snowing and raining outside.  Church was cancelled from the ice.  We are still going to a birthday dinner for a cousin today.   Other stuff!!!!   I like to say that I am sadden to know that  urlLink Jennicam  is ending!  I found her site while in college.  I loved it watching her cam!  I told my friends about it and they started watching it.  They even got me a year's subscription for it which was great!  I'm so disappointed that she is finally ending it after seven years.  She was the forerunner of the webcam era!  I will sorely miss watching her life!  I would also like to send a big ole shout out to  urlLink Flickerchick .  She wrote about me in her journal that thank me for writing to her.  I know she's busy but I sent her an email to wish her luck with things.  Also, they caught the rat bastard!!!  Saddam has been captured alive.  And boy does he look like shit!

      A funny thing happened at work yesterday.  An earthquake happened.  I was at my cubicle when I felt the whole place shake.  At first, I thought it was a plane since there is an airport about a mile away or it a black ops helicopter passing over us going to the government building next to us.  A few of us had to get up and rush to the window and see for ourselves, though nothing was visable.  We then began to hear reports on the radio that the epicenter was just south of us at 4.5 on the richter scale.  As I was leaving work, I was hearing on the radio that the earthquake was felt as far south as North Carolina, as far Noarth as Northern Va and Maryland.  I'm beginning to wonder how safe it is to live around here since we've been getting alot of earthquakes.  My only theory is......THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END!

       Quote of the day!   The Quote of the day actually comes from my mom.  Today we spent the day working on my house.  At one point, she looks at me and says to me, "You look like your from Iran!"  I was dumbfounded.  The only explaination for that statement would have be because I have been growing a beard for about a week now and I look scruffy!  I chuckled and just said, "Na, I think I look like an Iraqi!"  She just gave me a dumbfounded look and chuckled a bit.

       Quote from "Night of the Creeps"   We all know that B-movies provide great action, suspense, and dialogue.  This one is no exception.   urlLink Night of the Creeps"  is about these space leeches that get into any living being and make them a zombie.  The climax is when several of the key characters.....a old, down-on-his luck cop and a geeky college kid, travel to the nest of the space leeches....which happens to be a sorority house.  They get there in time, just to find that some frat boys have been zombified by these leeches.  The girls in the sorority house don't know what's going, because they are too busy getting ready to party.  Here's where the quote comes in:  As the cop looks out the window, he says; "Well girls, I have good news and I have bad news.  The good news is your dates are here!" Sorority girl: "What's the bad news?" Cop: "They're dead!"  That's some great writing there.  I give it an A in my book to B-movies!

       2004 sucks so far!!!!   I swear, 2004 just keeps getting better and better.  Complete surprises behind every turn.  It's been a hectic and frustrating week so far.  Here's the recap of the last few days.   WORK   Okay, so my co-worker Dana is out till Thursday, since she is on leave because her grandfather died.  So since she is gone, guess who has to step up to the plate and help....ME!  Now I don't mind some of the stuff because I've been helping her anyway.  However, I'm doing almost all her job for the this week, except for Thursday, when she'll be in for one day.  Friday she goes to get an operation.  So basically her job is to work on invoices and confirmations, which takes up most of the day.  I havent' been able to do my work much for the last few weeks because I've been helping her out.  I need a vacation!   FRIENDS   I have this friend, Chau, who I've known since my freshman year in college.  She is this very quite and secluded person....doesn't ask for help much.  In October, I called her to see how she was doing.  She told me that she wasn't doing too well because her father died, she quite her job, she broke up with her boyfriend of three years, and was in a car accident and still hurting from it, all within a few weeks before that time.  She told me she call me back and I told her that I was coming up to Northern VA for New Years if she want to come and party. Well, around Christmas, I decide to call her.  However, I get a automated message on her phone that she wanted to thank everyone who called but wasn't taken any messages from anyone besides her doctor and lawyer.  I knew she was in trouble to do this.  It also said to call back on Jan. 2nd.  So after New Years, I tried calling but it said that the phone was not answering.  So I waited a few weeks and callled again last night.  However, it said that the phone number was not in service anymore.  I got freaked out and decided to email her, in hoping that it would work saying I was worried about her.  Well, I got an answer.....SHE FUCKING MOVED TO CALIFORNIA!!!!  One line email....said she moved there to get settled and is a bit busy to reply back at the moment.  I am so frustrated with her now!  It just pisses me off to think that a friend would not tell this to me.   DREAMS   I had another wierd dream again last night.  This time, I'm playing on jungle bars but I'm full grown.  I see Paris Hilton and a couple of other girls hanging around there too.  I'm hoping to get thier attention but it doesn't work.  Then I run into a guy I know.....but never really knew that well.....John Delong.....and he wants to fight me.  I stand up to him, but we don't fight.....and he backs down.  The dream then goes on by me inviting Paris and the other girls to a family party.  That's where it ends So I decide to tell a couple of co-workers about this dream, including my friend Rachel.  Apparently they both agreed what the dream meant.  Here's the synopsis....I'm trying to find a girlfriend by getting the attention of Paris and other girls......very plausible!   Standing up to John......facing myself that I don't like.......could very well be!  And inviting Paris and girls to my family party......I want to have a family......maybe!!!!  So why the hell am I having so many fucking dreams!!!!  I need a vacation!  I think I'll go to Ireland and find me a nice busty fiery Redhead!

       Home on a Friday night....   I'm here, at home, on a Friday night!  It's been a long week at work.  Our vendor expeditor, Maranatha, had a breakdown or something and hasn't come in all week.  What's bad enough is that she had a stack of work in which some is dated since October.  Her job is a contact between vendor and customer and see the status of most orders that customers make.  It's not good when she neglects customer orders since October.   Well anyway our Call Center director, Mitch, asked if my co-worker Dana who is the closest thing to working with vendors to do all her shit.  The thing is, Dana is in the Merchandising department with me, and Maranatha works downstairs in the call center, so it is to different departments.  Well, since Dana is doing Maranatha's job, I'm the lucky one who get's to do Dana's job, which I know by now.  It just pisses Dana and I off the Maranatha allowed her work to pile up like that and then have us, a totally different department, work on it.   To top it all off, Dana and I only get a 4 percent raise which is suppose to be the company standard, we work our asses off.  It was even acknowledged at the last company dinner, when the two of us worked on 10,000 invoices in a month....which was a record!  And yet, there are a few people in the company that actually get more than the 4 percent because they either (A) bitch and moan and say that they will quit if they don't get what they want or (B) some just kiss up to the higher ups!  Anyway that's my rant for the week!  Right now I'm watching  urlLink Talk Sex With Sue Johanson !  I guess since I'm not getting any at the moment, I might as well listen to other peoples problems.  Actually it's quite a funny and intertaining show on the Oxygen channel.  She is the this old lady who talks about  sex issues with callers and even shows off some toys and other tools!  You never really get use to hearing this old lady talk about sex!  I've been having wierd dreams lately.  One of the dreams include being in the next town over, Waynesboro, during a natural disaster such as a volcano or earthquake.   During it, I remember dreaming of people trying to get out of town while a few of us stay.  At one point, I am staying in a huge house which turns into a movie theater.  I remember pulling out a gun which I think is laser scoped and shooting it a screen, but the gun doesn't work when I fire it.  I don't remember much after that.  Anyway, during lunch this work, I told a few people about the dream and they seemed to interpret it as dealing with the breakup with Loreley (which the natural disaster is interpreted as) and the gun not working......well, apparently deals with "shooting blanks"!  I don't know.....you tell me!  Tomorrow, I will be working on the house again.  We might put up the siding on the outside if it's not too cold.  I also think that we will work on the front porch too.  Well, let me get back to Sue and hear about all the anal sex and female orgasims!

       I'm the King of Icicles!!   That should be my title after Saturday.  I went up to work on my house that day, which suppose to be a high of 25 degrees.  However, where I'm at, there's a 5 to 10 degree difference, so it had to be 15 degrees!!!  We worked mostly on the inside, but I had fire duty outside for better part of the day.  I was playing with fire actually....burning the wood and trash!  Anyway, we got most if not all the inside finished. By the time I got up today to go the Church, I was hurting all over.  Mostly my lower back and and my arms were hurting from hammering some hurricane straps inside.  If I didn't have muscles before....I do now!  When we got to church, it was a surprise to see my mom's cousin, her son, and they brought a young woman (married) to church with them since she was new to the area.   After church, my parents and I went to Lowe's to look at windows.  I decided to look for an octagonal or moon shaped window for the living room/kitchen to lighten up them up.  When we left, we got several lights for the outside, the bathroom and bathtub faucets, and the kitchen sink faucet on sale.  All of them were a great find since they were on clearance sale.  Later, I found out that they all totaled up to be what one kitchen faucet would have cost.  Woo hoo! After coming up, I was still tired.  So I decided to take a nap, but being so tired from the day before, I slept for 3 1/2 hours!  I was planning on going over to  urlLink Rachel's  place but called to cancel.  Sorry Rachel!  And I will post those questions some time, not just the personal wisdom that I posted on Friday! Now, I'm watching "The Surreal Life" on the WB.  Oh my...when you have Ron Jeremy (pornstar) and Tammy Faye "Baker" (a conservative televangilist) in the same house, you know trouble is coming.  I was just watching when Rob Van Winkle (Vanilla Ice) was telling them and Trishelle (Real World Las Vegas) about beliving that we were orginially from outer space.....I just about died laughing!  Also on the show is Tracy Bigham (Baywatch) and Eric Estrada (Ponch from "Chips).

       I APOLOGIZE....   I want to apologize to those that have read my previous entry.  As some have pointed out, my rant was not logical nor unbaised in my statement about "bad boys".  I went off on a common rant that I have that I know...KNOW....is not completely true about all women wanting to date bad boys or those in need.  I have been corrected on this issue many times, but always tend to come back to this conclusion when I am frustrated with the opposite sex.  I apologize for my rant on the subject.  However, I hope you realize that at the time, I was angry, upset, and frustrated.  At times, I write in this journal as a way to project my anger and frustration, in only because I did not feel like vented that to another person.  I only say this rant when I get upset with myself in believing that "bad boy" concept only applies to me.  I know it's not true, but I can't help from my experience to sometimes believe it.   Can you honestly say that in this situation of anger and frustration that logic, instead of emotion, is applied?  I want to thank you to those who offered their sentiments and support.   Again, I will apologize for my illogical approach and rant but not my state of mind.  I hope you understand.

       So long, take care, bye bye now!   Loreley and I decided to end things tonight.  We both decided to mutually breakup.  It started when I asked her how she felt about me after six months.  The last few months, when I asked her the same question, she would tell me "I don't know".  I realize before Christmas that things were not working out, but I decided to wait until the holidays were over to have this talk.  Anyway, when I asked her this time, she finally admitted that she didn't love me.  She was still not over her last boyfriend/fiancee when that ended over 10 months ago.  It was difficult but I knew it was for the best for the both of us. One of the things that she told me was that I was a "well rounded" guy, which was one the things that really couldn't get into.  It's really be that stigma of being a "well rounded" or "nice" guy of why girls aren't attracted to me.  I mean, we all know that women are attracted to that "bad boy" persona.  There are so many theories of why women do that.  Some inlude that the "bad boy" is exciting and unpredictable and women want that excitement.  Another theory is that women want to be needed, or simply say that women want to know that men are in need of them to help them out in some way. Whatever the theory is, I really don't care anymore.  However, I think that because I am independent, well-rounded, and nice, it comes off as though I don't need to be help, being needful, or any kind of support.  In someway I'm beginning to feel that I scare off women because of that.  The truth is I do need that support, if only in the way of emotional support.    I'll find someone....someday.

       PICTURES!!!!   Thanks to my friend Kristina, who was also the host, here are the pictures of the  urlLink New Year's Party  that I attended.  Take a look!  It was wild!

       RING IN THE NEW YEAR!!!   For New Year's, I decided to go up to Northern Virginia to my friend Kristina's party.  I left after work from Charlottesville, got up there around 7 to hang out with my friend Nick, and heading over to her party at 8.  It started out great, which I even had some alcohol (which if you know me, you know I don't drink much).  I had a tequila shot, several shots of vodka, a mimosa (orange juice with champagne) and coke with some rum (which the amount that I put in probably wouldn't be considered a rum & coke)!  I was crazy that night, allowing at one point to drop my pants to show my American Flag boxers.  I only showed them after telling some of the people there that I patriotic and they wanted to see them.  Hell, I wasn't even drunk.    But the question is, " What did I do at midnight?"   The answer was in the bathroom watching my drunk friend puking her guts out in the toilet.  Now, I'm sure you are asking, why would you be doing that at the stroke of midnight.  It's not like you've seen any other drunk ass people puking in the bathroom.  Well, I was worried about my friend because she is diabetic!  I spent from 11 to 1, just hanging out with her, trying to protect her from the other drunken friends from taking pictures.  So, at the the very stroke of midnight, while hearing the countdown outside, I was watching my friend puke!  Don't get me wrong....I wasn't pissed that I missed the countdown to the new year!  Actually I was very proud of myself for being there for my friend.  I don't get that many chances to be a friend much so this was a proud moment of mine.  I've heard a saying before that says this, " A real friend will help bail you out of jail.....a best friend would be right there beside you in jail, saying 'Damn, that was fun!   So I guess, I can say I was a true or best friend.  The next day, I went to see my friend  urlLink Ginger  and meet her fiancee Robert.  All we did was play board games, which was a relief from the night before.  They seem so happy with each other, so I'm extremely happy for them myself.

       Size does matter!   Yes, it is finally confirmed.....an extra 2 inches does matter!    Two inches matter with the height of the bar that is.  I've been arguing with my mother about what the height of the bar should be in my house.  She wants it at the height that it is right now.  As for me, I want it 2 inches higher because it allows the recepticles to be out of the back splash, therefore no water can get into them.  Her reasoning behind the smaller height......her family is short and wouldn't be able to reach over the bar!  Well, mom, I take safety over convienence.  Besides....it's my house, ain't it?

      I've come to the conclusion of what my problem is now!  It's because I think too much!  Seriously....if you don't believe me, read the previous journal entry.  I have to stop thinking and start doing!    But is that really my problem?

       Pondering thought   I'm curious.....why is it normal to kiss/make out with your eyes closed?  And if you do open your eyes, and your boyfriend/girlfriend sees this, why does it freak them out?  Sometimes I've found myself opening my eyes while kissing....even though its not normal!  You think it would be good to watch the other person to see if you are a good kisser or not.  Even with sex.....shouldn't you watch your lover so you can observe how he/she reacts to certains movements and touches, so you can be a better lover, right?  Maybe I'm just naive!  Anyway...just wanted to continue with the poems.  My favorite is actually one that my grandfather wrote over 50 years ago.  This is it.   That's Me Without You    A night with no moonlight; A day with no sun; A plane with no pilot; A watch that won't run. A tree with no branches; A rose with no petals; A boy with no sweetheart; That's me without you.  A train with no whistle; A car with no gas; A well with no water; A show with no cast. A love with no future; A sky with no blue; A boy with no sweetheart; That's me without you.  A bank with no money; A top that won't spin; A book with no story; A love I can't win. A chair with no bottom; A rig with no crew; A song with no music; That's me without you.  A court with no jury; A church with no pew; A boy with no sweetheart; That's me without you.

       The Day is coming.....   So, the day is getting closer which I’m dreading.  It comes and goes every year…..and each time it gets worse. That day is…..St. Valentine’s Day! Yes…that sacred day of love.  Why do we set aside one day of the year to celebrate something that we should do everyday?  I know it can be complicated to be romantic every day or try to be.  It takes work and patience.  But what do I know…..I’ve always been single every time Valentine’s Day roles around.  It’s a Hallmark holiday that makes people spend money and makes those that don’t have someone special like crap.  Who wants that? But I digress.  Now I may complain about this hallmark holiday, but I’m sure if I had that someone special, I would do something extraordinary or romantic.  I would hope that doing something for one day doesn’t reflect on my emotional and romantic sentiment for the rest of the year with a special love.  I don’t know if I had my chance to express it yet or remember doing it.  Actually though, I do remember my most romantic moment for me, and it fell on a day that no one expect….Halloween.  I might tell that story later but I just wanted to express my opinion for St. Valentine’s Day.  I will share some poetry this week that I’ve written before.  I’m sure many have read them before but I will share them again for this week that relates to the subject of St. Valentine’s Day.     Awaiting    I await for her, My true love to be. Ever so patiently, Along the path of eternity. I know not her name never spoken, Nor her presence never felt. But by will of God or simple fate, I will meet my life’s true soul mate. The time will come to pass, When angel’s sing and the heavens part. My true love is close by the telling, By the heavy beating of my heat.

       Quote of the evening   "It's like the circus came to town and somebody let the monkey's loose!"  It's been one of those weeks where there has been too much going on.  At work especially, family issues, and me just being frustrated.  A lot of drama going on.  I need a vacation!

      House update…..well, as of Monday, the dry wall has been put up in most the house.  I’m hoping that since it rained today, it didn’t stop the subcontractor from not being able to finish.  I think the process is once the dry wall is up, he has to put in “mud” to seal off the cracks.  Apparently if the temperature is below 50 degrees, it can crack, which is why I’m worried today since it’s below that temperature.   I can’t tell you how much I will be so happy to move out.  Don’t get me wrong….my parents are great…..but it’s been 4 years living with them since I graduated college.  I think it’s time!  Besides, I got even more incentive to move out after what happened last Thursday, when I got home late from my friend Rachel’s!  As I walk in, walking down the hallway, I hear my parents HAVING SEX!!!!  Damn…..I didn’t really need to hear them.  And it was LOUD too!!!  Well, look on the bright side….I didn’t hear them say….”Who’s your daddy?”  I would have had to go in there and shout…”YOU ARE DAMMIT!!!”  Only a few more months!!!!  Saturday, we didn’t much but clean up some brush in the yard and around the workshop.  I’m definitely getting a workout from walking up and down the hill.    On Sunday, I went to see “Passion of the Christ” with my mom after church.  It’s hard to describe that movie in just a few words.  Both of us left the theater quiet and somber, which my mom never does.  It does move you and it makes you reflect on your faith and religion.    After coming home from the movie, I went over to my friend Rachel’s for the evening.  She cooked us dinner….which include pork chops and stuffing (which I did try).  After dinner, we played a fun game called “Therapy” which I think I needed after what happened on Thursday.  I laughed so hard from playing it that I hurt my neck!  I think it was much needed though!

      Ok.....I can't decided tonight.  Either watch "I Love The 80's Strike Back" on  VH1  or "101 Reasons Why The 90's Ruled" on  E! .  Feeling a bit nostalgic from them.  Could be one of the reasons why I'm so antsy as of late.  I guess I should give an update on the house.  Insulation is in, dry wall delivered and ready to put up, and I got most of my appliances on Friday.  I think I pulled my arm from pulling branches on Saturday.  Went to a party on Saturday that was thrown by the Marketing Director to celebrate the finishing of the catalog.  Somehow I got into a discussion with my co-workers girlfriend of how such a nice guy I was......which i don't want to get into any more.  Also got into another discussion with the same girl and the wife of another co-worker of how wierd I am because I've never gotten drunk!  I think it's now everybody I know purpose to see me drunk.  I wonder why?

My new leather sofa 3.  getting closer to finishing my house 4.  Dinner with friends on Sunday 5.  Watching the Oscars on Sunday 6.  Getting a 1902 Silver Dollar from my great Uncle 7.  Actually getting an email from a friend that I haven't heard from in a while, even though it was to give out her new number.   Wish list  1.  Finishing the house 2.  Having that house party 3.  Vacation (desperately needing at this moment) 4.  Hearing from more friends

       MORE PICTURES!   Well, I finally got more  urlLink pictures of the house  to share with everybody.  These pictures were taken a few weeks ago after the drywall was finished.  Since then, the trim, doors, and paint have gone up, shudders put up front, and the kitchen/bathroom cabinets and wood floors have been delivered to the house.  Everything should be finished within another month and half to two months (God willing).  I'm looking forward to having a big party to celebrate.  I know my friend Rachel is anxious to have it too.....but I'm trying to finish up first.

       Walking down memory lane!   You know the worst thing about packing is?  Nostalgia!  Really....seriously!  As you are packing all your stuff, you tend to find old pictures, letters, momentos of all the stuff you are leaving behind.  I was packing all my books that I have and I found an old notebook from college that I had that had a bunch of phone numbers of friends that I had and other people that I barely got to know.  There's a number for a girl that I had a crush on in one my classes.  I know I can't call because I know she moved on.  I found a picture of a birthday cake that had the names of my friend Chau (who now lives in California) and Marisol (who I lost touch with after graduating in college).  Just the other night, I was showing some old movies (Hijinxs I and II) to some friends and I began to wish for the old times.  BTW Ryan....I finally got the String Joke....after 4 years!  I think I didn't hear the punch line at the time though.  I'm almost finished with the house.  We finished putting in the wood floors on Monday and put in the hanging microwave.  The electricity is in and the lights are on.  Now just need to do touch ups and paint a little bit more inside.  Need to finish the outside front porch and get the water running.  However, my father is a bit of a downer when he told me that I might not be able to really move in until JULY!!!!  Dammit....why not????  Because of rules and regulations, that's why.  Something to do with testing the water or something or another that takes too much damn time.  On Sunday, I went hiking with some friends on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  What a nice and beautiful day it was!  We hiked along one trial called White Rocks Falls.  I actually went camping there last year with a couple of friends from Northern Virginia.  I found the place that we camped at and I was disappointed to find that it was covered over with all kinds of growth.  We eventually got to the falls which were wonderful.  When I went last year, it was a drought so not alot of water flowing.  This time though, the water was pounding strongly along the falls.  Round trip of the hike was about 3 miles, I think!  I just say for the record....NOSTALGIA FUCKING SUCKS!!!!!  By the way....I'm going tomorrow to get my teeth cleaned.  Why would I add this.  Well, apparently there is a gorgeous and single blonde that works in the office across the hall from my dentist.  I figured I go in an introduce myself to her.....maybe try to sweep her off her feet with my charming personality and good looks (off in the background, I can hear somebody laughing at this!).  Wish me luck anyway!

       UPDATE   It's been a while since my last entry.  I've been pretty busy lately with the house as well as softball.  Let's see....as of last Saturday, I had about 90% of the back deck on, kitchen and bathroom cabinets in, almost everything is painted (with the exceptions of a few coats of paint on the trim and the skylight).  All that really needs to be finished on the inside of the house is putting the wood floors in.  The kitchen is gorgeous.....the cabinets and the bar look great!  I've been going up almost every other night after work during the week to work on it.  I also got my phone number and satellite television ordered which should be set on June 8th.  On June 14th, I should sign all the papers to close!!!!  July 10th.....PARTY!!!  The other nights I'm playing softball with both my company and church.  Both teams are as different as night and day.  My company softball team (which is all guys) is currently 1 and 5, while my church team is perfect right now with a record of 3 and 0.  I get the added bonus of having to play with my ex-girlfriend, Loreley, play on the team last Friday.  Actually things are fine with us since the breakup.  I actually invited her to the party that I'm having at my place on July 10th.  Things at work are pretty dramatic.  A co-worker downstairs just doesn't get a clue of what she is suppose to be doing in her job.  No one really likes her and she has pissed off everybody, including all of our vendors that work with my company!   I seemed to have done a big boo boo for Mother's day!  I got my mom a Mother's Day card for her.  When I woke up on Mother's Day, I saw her in the living room, sitting in the chair, and I go up to her, give her a kiss on the head, and say Happy Mother's Day.  I left the card on the table for her.  Anyway a few minutes later, she asks me where's my gift to her?  Uhhhhhhhh.....SHIT!!!  All I could say is I didn't know what to get her.  Well, sufficite to say, she was pissed. I could have offered to take her out to dinner but we have been so busy with the house lately, I didn't really think about it. All I could do was turn around and head downstairs.  A few minutes later, my father came down and asked why I made mom mad.  I told her what happened and he told me I did a stupid thing.  He goes on to tell me there are three days that I never forget about mom.....her birthday, Christmas and Mother's day! Well, we all go to church together that morning.  AFter church, we went to Sam's club.  While there, I decided to buy her some pre-planted rose bushes.  When I gave them to her, it made her happy!  Well, that's what she said....but I know she will remember this!

      Finally!  It's finished and I'm all moved in.  I finalized everything on Wednesday (with a lot of frustration....loooong story) and I am now offically a home owner.  Now comes the hard part.....keeping up the home.  Once I have pictures, I'll post them.  The party is still on in three weeks...July 10th...unless it rains, like it's been doing for the last few weeks!  Yesterday, there was some news going around the office.  They found a body next door at Oakwood homes, where they sell mobile and prefinished homes.  The news went around like wild fire with everybody speculating what happened.  Apparently someone just dropped the body off quickly because it was right next to a garbage bin and raced off when they couldn't get the body into the bin!    Anyway...that's about it.  I'm still waiting to get my phone hooked up and television next Saturday.  I'll probably be without internet for a couple of weeks, so I just check things from work or come back to my parents place.  Right now they are down in Florida in Disney World.  I wish I was going with them!  I might go to Minnesota in August though.  Oh, before I go, I wanted to know if anybody heard the "Marble in a jar" theory.  I'm sure there are different variations to it, but some of the married guys keep telling me about it, but I don't believe it.  The theory goes, for the husband, that in the first year of marriage.....or even dating your potential mate up till the first year of marriage....that every time you have sex, you put a marble in a jar.  After that time, when you have sex with the spouse, you take a marble out of the jar.  The guys at work tell me that the marbles in the jar will never be gone from the jar.  Those guys tell me it's true with every marriage.  I think they are just say that because they are truly not getting any and just want to whine about it!  I'm sure there are many people out there that can debunk this theory!

      I am seriously stressing out right now about the house.  I close in a week and a half, with some things still needing to get down.  The porch is done but not the steps, and that's one of the things I need for the final county inspection....which in turn is needed for the occupancy permit....which is in turn is needed for to close with the bank!  If this damn rain would go away, the mason can finish the steps.  All the small things are really pushing me to insanity.    Funny thing last night too.  I went up to the house after work and I found that my uncle put some more sand on the road so he could put down more rock for the drive way.  Well, I tried to drive up it in my puny Mazda Protege!  WRONG!!!  I ended up slipping down back the driveway because it was too muddy and slick and almost ended up over the bank and dropping 5 feet over it onto the main road.  Luckily, my wheels got stuck between the railroad ties that are near the edge.   So I stopped the car, and decided to meet my mom, who was finishing up painting at the house.  However, she tried to back down the driveway in my father's baby, his Ford F150.  WRONG AGAIN!!!!  This time she was slipping back on the same spot too and had to stop before hitting my car which was still stuck.  Well, we ended up calling my uncle to come and pull us out.   We didn't tell Dad what happened an>
