      Okay, so, I really, really shouldn't be doing this.  Doing what?  Writing this shit right now.  Not like I ever do, but right now for some reason, right now of all times, I'm writing.  I wish I could write for a long time, I'm really in the mood...but I totally have to pack up my stuff.  I have sooooo much more shit to pack...I'm sadly moving from Berkeley, my hometown of almost five years now, back to L.A.  The Valley.  Ugh.  I don't know if I will be able to adjust myself to the superficiality that runs through the veins of the city - after living here in Berkeley for so long, I can't stand anything of the sort.  Come on dude.  You're normal if you are a gutter punk living on the street asking for change for beer and pot.  You're normal if you consider Bush and Cheney the true terrorists of the world.  You're normal if you have like 20 piercings and pink hair and strip in Tijuana for money so you can buy pills and then get arrested and...oh wait, maybe that's not normal.  But...L.A.?  You're only normal if you look and act and talk and think just like everyone else, and wear the same clothes, and do the same things, and have money for this and that and other stupid shit.  What the fuck am I gonna do dude?  I suppose My Mother will want me to slowly assimilate - in fact, she's already made me a hair and nail appointment for when I get down there.  Not that that's particularly an L.A. thing, I mean, I know people who do that here (even though I hate her...er, them), but I think it just shows very well how the culture is down there.  Fuckin shitass.

      Fuck.  I feel so...depressed right now.  Why?  I've been fine all day.  Well, I did sleep all day, maybe that's why I was fine.  Yes, I went to sleep earlier, and wound up sleeping until about 4:45.  Fucking a!  When I said earlier that I'd probably get in bed and sleep for 8 more hours, I thought I was joking and exaggerating.  But noooo.  I guess I have to watch what I say!  I really fucking want some ice cream right now.  I wish I had some.  Maybe I'll drive down the hill and go to Safeway to get some.  I think they close at midnight.

      It feels really good to close my eyes.  I don't exactly feel tired, but I guess I am.  I'm trying to decide if I should do some more oxy (I did some like 4 hours ago or something), and right now I'm leaning towards no.  It's already late, I'm starting to get tired...I can just save it and do it tomorrow.  However, I will smoke a bowl (of course).  Sometimes I wonder what my lungs look like, since I smoke so much weed, and I did smoke a bunch of cloves a few years ago, and now I smoke a cigarette now and again.  But mainly, the weed.  Are they black and dripping with resin?  If someone put my lungs in a pipe and smoked it, I bet they'd get really fucking high.  Isn't that disgusting?  I mean about the smoking lungs part, not the part about getting high from my body parts.  That's actually pretty awesome.  Now I'm trying to decide again about the oxy.  It would be pretty good right now.  Bah.  I guess I'll do a small line.  I just want that taste in the back of my throat.  Really, there's no need to be concerned.  It would be so much better with a little beer though, I wish we had some beer other than Keystone Light.  Yuck.  Give me a break!  I hate when Ed buys that shit.  I like real beer, baby.  Fuck, I just dropped the small amount of the 80mg pill of oxy, the last bit I have left.  It's dark in here, and the carpet is that weird offwhite-grayish color (the pill is white).  How the fuck am I gonna find it?  I already have a line sitting here, so that's not the problem - I just don't want it to get smashed into the carpet, or worse, have Jezebel eat it or something.  I better get my lighter and get on my knees.  Ooh, that kind of sounds erotic.  Now I close my eyes again, and I think, what am I doing?  Why am I doing oxy, I don't really need it right now.  It's already like 3am.  No, it's later.  Okay, I did it.  I did some oxy.  Now let me hit this bowl of trainwreck, yo.  Mar-i-juana is mmm mmm good.  Awesome!  I miraculously found the little chunk of oxy without too much effort.  Yay.  I feel so bloated today, it's kind of gross.  I don't really know why, but it could be because I ate, like, a massive amount of food yesterday.  Or at least I rememeber yesterday I felt like I did.  Who knows.  I also watched the movie  urlLink JFK  yesterday - it was super long, and I felt like nothing really happened in it.  But, it was still a good movie.  I got my toenails done all nice during it, a nice, shiny red.  Very pretty.  Soon I'll be able to take pics of these kinds of things and then post them for all to see. :)  Maybe it would come up under a foot fetish search.  Lol.  So yeah!  I didn't get to finish earlier.  I totally got a place.  I'm really happy, but I keep having doubts about it since it's kind of small.  But, I am saving money since all utilities are paid.  I move in this week...over and over I arrange the place in my head.  I wish I could see it again, or I wish I knew the exact measurements or something.  I want to go over there again maybe tomorrow or something if they're okay with that, and I'll bring a tape measure.  Then I'll know exactly how much space I have to work with.  I can't wait to take pictures!  Seriously though, I don't know if I'll have enough space for much more than my bed, desk, and a dresser...I'm sure I'll be able to figure something out though.  I hope.  I mean, I totally have enough stuff to furnish a two bedroom apartment, so I'm really gonna have to pick and choose what I want.  Also, I haven't asked about pets, so Jezebel may be an issue - I want to ask about her, but I also don't want to risk losing the place.  Even though I know she's not a problem, other people may be weird about rats.  I'm also trying to decide which philosophy of feng shui to use.  But, I still have some time.  I don't think I'll use the compass method, I don't like it.  I can't really remember the lighting situation either.  Eh well.  I'm just so excited!  I can't wait to move in.  I'll have to decide what posters to put up too.  I wish I had money, I'd buy so much new stuff that (I feel like) I need.  Especially stuff from IKEA, cute stuff for my new place.  Well, shit dawg...I'm getting tired.

      What the hell.  I was just writing something, then I stupidly clicked on a link and all my shit disappeared.  Good thing I had only written like 3-4 lines.  Mostly me complaining about...nothing, really.  Just complaining.  Oh well, I'll just start over.  Fuckin' shitass.  Yeah, that's right.  Fuck-ing shit-ass.  It's already after 4pm on Sunday afternoon.  What am I doing with myself?  I haven't done anything all weekend.  I woke up at like 2:45pm or so, and I've pretty much been sitting here at the computer ever since.  Well, not the whole time, but just about.  I made some tea like an hour ago, and most of it is still sitting here in the mug.  I think Jezebel might have actually drank (drunk?) more than I have so far.  No no, not really.  But she does seem to get way excited about getting to drink my tea.  She is so cute.  Hey...I got a place!  I have my own place!@#  I'm so fucking excited, you have no idea.  It's the place in Montclair.  Or Piedmont, technically.

      So I went to the cafe, made it there at like 7:50pm or so (he closes up at 8). He kicked some people out, then made me my drink for there. I love when he does that, it makes me feel cool. I watched him clean up, we chatted, I even did some dishes. I was really high. Then we went out to smoke our ritual cigarette and chatted some more. He asked me a little about smoking weed.   I managed to lose track of time, surprise. It was 9pm when I looked at the time, and I was still at the cafe. Fuck.   Later,I watched  urlLink Zoolander . I heard a bunch of people say it was really funny and pretty good, but I thought it sucked, honestly. A few parts made me laugh, but overall I'd say it wasn't that good. Although, the more fucked up I got during the course of the movie, the funnier it was. That's not necessarily a good thing though.   I am so excited to be living alone...maybe I will feel all grown up. Maybe it will help me get my act together and get a fucking job. But no, really, I'm just excited that I'll be more in charge of what I do with my time, and I'll be able to decorate however I want and arrange the furniture however I want and all that jazz. I can feng shui my heart out, with no one sitting there to tell me I'm crazy and wasting my time.  I am waiting to hear back from these two studios I applied to. One is in the  urlLink Lake Merritt area , in this really cool art deco type building from the 1920s. You walk inside and it's like a hotel, not an apartment building. And the neighborhood is actually pretty nice. The apartment itself isn't bad either - its on the sixth floor, and has a bathroom, a full kitchen, and a good size, uh, area? The part that's not kitchen or bathroom. There's one closet, not too small, but closet space overall is pretty skimpy. The bathroom is pretty cool - there's this whole mirror-vanity thing with little drawers and a little counter and stuff, it's so cute. I still haven't heard back about it though. I'd be taking over this other girl's lease for the next six months. I lied about a job - Veronica said I can say I work for her, so I'd have something to put on the application. I did a credit check on myself yesterday though, and my credit was REALLY bad. It said I was high risk or something. That sucks. All the utilities in this place are paid too, except for phone and cable. Not bad. Supposedly there's no pets allowed, so I don't know what I'd do about Jezebel - sneak her in or ask them about her. But maybe I won't even get it since my credit sucks so bad. Keep your philanges crossed, please.   The other place I applied for is an inlaw studio - basically, a room attached to someone's house with a separate entrance. It's in the more upscale Oakland area of  urlLink Piedmont , which is actually its own city for some reason. The place is within walking distance to  urlLink Montclair Village , the cute little outdoor shopping area with lots of rich white folk and no homeless people or panhandlers. It's all very nice and clean - you'd never guess it was part of the stereotypically ghetto Oaktown. (Seriously, check out the link for Montclair Village, it totally made me laugh. It's a real fucking village!) The studio itself is pretty small actually - I think the ehousing listing said something like 300 sq. ft., but that didn't really help me when I read it, and it still doesn't help me now. It's about the size of an average room. There's no actual kitchen, there's a kitchenette - basically, kitchen stuff built in to one of the walls. There's no bathtub in the bathroom, but the bathroom isn't bad otherwise. There is a TON of closet space, which is really cool. And what's cool is that there's a window that overlooks the bay, and when I exit the studio I'm actually outside looking at the bay on a nice deck with nice landscaping around me. This place is nicer than the Lake Merritt place, but it's smaller, and $45 more a month. A family lives in the house - a husband and a wife, and their two young boys (I think the older one is four years old). I'm a little worried about smoking...but I'm sure everything would be okay. It's about five to seven minutes away from A's house, driving. There's a busstop within walking distance (right in Montclair Village). Their ad also says no pets, but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't mind Jezebel. They really liked me, the mom told me, so hopefully I'll get this place. All utilities are paid here too, including cable. I'm wondering about internet access...I really want dsl. I can't stand cable modem, which I'm using at A's house right now. And, since this place is pretty small, I really wouldn't be able to fit much of my stuff (furniture-wise) into it. That kinda sucks actually.   Eh well, we'll see what happens. Hopefully I'll get at least one of the two!

       LA, Part II   So I drove for a few hours, and a few hours more.  It was a full moon that night, Friday the 13th.  I kept having bad feelings, but I do tend to be a bit superstitious occasionally.  I just really felt like I was making a really bad decision.  But I just kept remembering something my mother had said to me earlier that day - think of the trip to LA as a several week long vacation, something to let me know where I really wanted to be.  I may still miss Berkeley in a few weeks, or I may be fine in LA, we could just wait and see.  I knew I wouldn't be fine...  I arrived in LA around 1:30am if I remember correctly.  I was super tired - I had only gotten like a total of 5 hours of sleep the previous two nights combined, added to way more physical labor than I was used to (which is...um, none), the labor that comes with moving large boxes filled with massive amounts of shit (not literal shit, of course).   I had to wake up at around 7am that day if I wanted to get to the testing site on time, which I did.  I went inside my parents' house, found my stepfather passed out on the couch and my brother awake in his room playing computer games.  Nothing seems to have changed since I was here last, or the time before that, or the time before that....  My disassembled computer was sitting in the back seat of the rental.  Given the fact that the crime rate has been steadily increasing in the valley the past few years, and just my better judgement, I didn't want to leave my shit in the car.  I started to slowly bring in piece by piece of my computer, and recruited my brother to help.  Keep in mind he's only 12, so he isn't really big enough to carry lots of shit at once.  But, he helps with what he can.  As we were walking in from outside at some point, my brother accidentally let the screen door slam, which woke up my stepdad who was until that point still passed out on the couch.  He was all incoherent and angry, and started yelling at me for "waking everyone up" and "what am I doing coming so late" and "why am I bringing all my shit in, I'm just keeping everyone up," and...I could go on, as one could imagine.  I explained I didn't want to leave my computer in the car overnight, that I would just bring it in and get the rest of the stuff tomorrow.  He said that was stupid and I should just leave it and go to bed.  He even followed me outside and was yelling at me in the street.  It was kind of embarassing, and just reaffirmed my feelings that I was making a huge mistake.  All his yelling woke up my mom, who came down all groggy and confused from upstairs.  What's going on? she asked.  Wayne just started yelling, and she said of course I should get my computer, is he crazy?  She calmed him down, then bitched at me a bit for "being incosiderate" and whatnot, but I could tell she was just yelling at me to appease him.  She actually did a good job of mediating that night.  So this whole time Jezebel was in the car.  I cleared some space with my brother on top of his dresser for her cage, the same place we kept the cage last December when I went home for krismas.  I brought her inside - her cage was the last thing coming in for the night.  When Wayne saw me coming inside with her, he started yelling again immediately.  He was telling me some bullshit like she needs to stay outside in the garage or on the patio, and I was saying that was ridiculous.  I knew some ghetto street rat would get in her cage and rape her.  Rats don't belong in bedrooms, he yelled.  Wtf, I was thinking.  Why couldn't you tell me this before the moment I get here?  I asked. It doesn't matter, the rat isn't staying in the house. Why? Because I said so. Well, give me a reason. Because I said so. I'm bringing her inside until you give me a reason. You better not bring her inside. I'm putting her down so I can at least shut the door. What are you doing?  I said don't bring the rat inside. I'm shutting the door, you don't want me to leave it open do you??  Here comes my mom down the stairs.  What's the problem? she asked. Wayne won't let me keep Jezebel inside. Wayne, why not? Rats don't belong inside, and there's no room in Michael's room. Oh, but I made room, I said. No, there's no room, you couldn't have. Well, I did, me and Mike.  He doesn't care, he said it's fine. Put the rat in the kitchen, he said. You want the rat in the kitchen?  Isn't that worse than keeping a rat in the bedroom?  That doesn't even make sense to me, I said. Rats are nocturnal and it will keep Michael up all night, you can't keep it in the bedroom. She's not that loud, if there's a problem, we can deal with it later, it's 2am. Wayne, just let her put the rat in the bedroom, we'll deal with this later.  So Jezebel got to stay in the bedroom, with me.  Yay.  I must have the most difficult, ridiculous parents ever.  Or at least it seems that way, all too often.  I got in bed, looked over my CBEST book, and set my alarm for 7am.  I actually got another 3 hours of sleep that night, I think.  And I still managed to do great on my test the next day.  Go me.  And so ends the day of arrival.

      Well now. It's been awhile since I've written anything, but, here I am in full force. I'm really fucked up right now - is that a surprise? It shouldn't be.   I've grown up a lot in the past month or so. As I mentioned in my last post, I packed up all my shit (well, most of it...what I didn't pack up and bring with me I put into a storage locker I rented) and moved down to LA. Where do I even begin with the LA experience? There's so much to talk about. Friday, June 13th (bad luck already - I should have realized the bad omen), I got my rental car, packed the shit I was taking with me into the car, and set off, leaving my Berkeley days behind me. I was terribly upset - I couldn't stop crying all day. I wouldn't have left that day except I had to take the CBEST the following day down in the valley. On my way out of town, I stopped for one last double vanilla iced latte at Fertile Grounds, made by the owner, Ayman. I knew I'd really miss him - we'd always had a fun, flirty rapport. Plus, I have the biggest crush on him. On the way there I almost got into an accident - yes, it's only a block and a half away from my old apartment complex, but hey now, I was dazed. Everything was fine though. Then as I parked, I witnessed an accident in the intersection directly in front of me. Freaky, I thought. But, in any case, I got my latte, and walked back to the car while wiping away tears. I really didn't want to leave.   When I got into the car, I proceeded to immediately spill a portion of my latte all over myself, my purse, and the rental car seats. Great. I'd have to go back into the cafe and clean myself off and get some napkins for the car seat. So I walked back in, which I'm sure was weird to Ayman. I told him what happened, and he gave me some paper towels. As I was trying to wipe off my purse, my glass chillum fell out onto the cement floor, shattering into a million pieces for all to see. I was so fucking embarassed. At first Ayman didn't notice, but when he did, he came out with a broom and asked if it was my pipe that broke. I told him yes, and he replied that it was a good thing. That's when I left for real, and started crying, although I can't say which happened first.

      Why do I feel so fucking tired?  I think I'm getting sick or something.  Boy, I have so much to say.  Pass that dutch.  But will I really say anything at all?  My left hand is hurting for some reason - not really my hand, but more like the bottom of my ring and middle fingers.  I don't know what the fuck is going on, but it sucks.  I wonder if I will ever be censored for anything I write in here, or have my shit removed.  You know, for like, talking about drugs and whatnot.  Whoa!  Drugs are cool.  I seriously wish more than anything that I would fucking get up and clean my room.  Why the lack of motivation?  Could it be the pot?  No.  Really I think it isn't.  Some kind of psychological block or something preventing me from cleaning.  My room is a complete disaster though, shouldn't that be enough motivation?  One would think so.  Not me, though.  I'm hella lit.

It sucks ass dude, being in pain all the time.  And I'm only 23.  Although lately everytime I look in the mirror I feel like I'm about 34.  I'm getting high.  Let me take another hit right now and I'll report the results.

      Ok I totally thought an earthquake was about to start.  Turns out it was just really loud thunder.  How awesome!  We never get thunderstorms.  I remember when I was a little girl and I used to stay with my grandparents out on Long Island for the summer, I loved it when there were huge thunderstorms.  My Nana would always come wake me up if it happened to be the middle of the night, and the power would go out and we would watch the sky flicker and listen to the house shake.  It was so much fun.  I hope my power doesn't go out now, I just thought about that.  What a motherfucking crazy storm this is right now.  My windows are hella rattling.  This is so awesome.  My weather report looks like this:  showers, showers, showers, showers, showers, showers...times like 37 or some shit like that.  And I totally have to open the store tomorrow at 9, which means leave house at like 7:10am...ugh.  Plus I left my umbrella at work.  Maybe I will just call a cab tomorrow igga.  This morning walking to the bus stop in the pouring rain was fucking hell dude.  It was like walking in a river.  But it wasn't so bad really, I just got super stoned and like, separated my mind from my body during that time.  I must have, it's the only way I could have dealt with that shit.  Being rained on and all that.  Praise the almighty jesus for my marijuana.

      I am so fucking cold dawg. I have so much to write about, if i so desired...I suppose I would need to use my discretion to decide what exactly I want to write, what I want "out there." It's like once I formulate thoughts and feelings into actual words - and write them down somewhere, no less - it just makes them that much more concrete. If I wanted to say that I was wrong or mistaken and I never thought or felt a certain way, now I can't. Putting shit out there makes it harder to deny later. And plus there's less mystery. Does that even make sense? I sound like a crackhead, and I haven't even hit my pipe yet. No, not my crack pipe. I don't even have one of those. I mean my mari-ja-wana pipe. I haven't hit my pipe since earlier,&nbsp;with Krislyn. What a crazy cat that chick is.

      HEY HEY HEY I'm what's happNUN.  Oh yeah, you know it.  I just got home a bit ago, and I'm eating taco bell (I'm a health goddess) and packin a bowl.  Pass that dutch.  Pass that dutch.  I seem to have suddenly gotten WAY into Missy Elliott in the past few days.  How did this come about?  I'm not sure really.  She is just so much woman, it's cool.  And she doesn't seem to give a fuck about what people think.  That's how I want to be.  A strong, independent woman who's cool and sexy and says what she thinks.  HEY HEY HEY.  I am going to smoke a little and write some more in a few.

      I feel like my life is a chaotic mess.  This feeling is represented well by my living quarters - random shit everywhere, not put away, making it impossible for any forward movement or progress.  Similarly, random issues and thoughts and worries are cluttering my mind.  I guess I'll just take another hit from my pipe and try to forget, once again.  I think I'm going to go get some food, and when I come back I'll sit here and write.  I promise.  Btw, I think the whole world is nuts right now...like there is some kind of odd alignment in the stars making the beginning of this year of the monkey super freaky.  Yow.

      So, I did laundry tonight.  Finally.  I love having clean clothes!  I spent like, $16 getting most of my stuff done.  Not even all of it.  Sigh.  Some day it will all be clean!  I'm putting my shit away right now, so I'll come back and make random statements every once in awhile. :)  Until then, play  urlLink this game ! I think it's in Dutch...just click on 'ja' and then 'start.'  Then try to pour a perfect glass of beer!  How entertaining.  I'm surprisingly good at it.  When you fuck up and want to try again just press 'nog een keer.'

      Wow dude.  It's been awhile, huh.  As usual.  I'm incredibly tired for some reason.  Or maybe I'm mistaken, and it's just me being high from the trainwreck I just smoked.

      Man.  I totally just woke up, at like, 5:30.  Yes, pm.  And my alarm was set for 11:30am.  And yes, I was indeed hitting snooze every nine minutes between 11:30am and 5:30pm.  Can you believe that?  I can, it's not really all that out of the ordinary.  But I really didn't want to wake up so late, I kind of wanted to get up at a reasonable hour and be productive.  You know, clean my room, run some errands, shit like that.  I really want to see Kill Bill Vol. 2.  I was supposed to go yesterday with some friends, but it was sold out everywhere by the time we tried to buy tickets at like, noon.  That sucked.  So I'm thinking maybe tonight I'll go to Tim and Patrick's and watch Volume 1.  I'd still rather go see Vol. 2, but it will be good to refresh my memory I guess, right?  Okay, shower time.  I wish I had a lot of drugs.

      Guess what!  Tim came over tonight to chill with me for a bit and smoke some bowls and he brought me a homie, which was really nice of him since he's collecting them too.  Usually we go and get them together, but I guess today he got a bunch from the machine on Shattuck by the In&Out Deli.  He let me pick one, which was awesome.  I chose the Eminem homie, aka  urlLink Angry White Boy .  He's so cute, he looks just like Eminem.    It tastes like burning!

      I'm eating lasagna with a spoon.  I'm not quite sure I've actually done this before, but I don't have any more clean forks and I'm definitely not about to wash one.  No way dawg.  I'm listening to the streaming video from msnbc.com - all the shit going on with 9/11 and Ashcroft and the FBI and Iraq and hostages and oh who else can we blame and drag into this and it will never end, never ever.  Congratulations, you're watching the beginning of WWIII.  I just finished my lasagna.  I'm pretty high.  I've been smoking pretty steadily for the past few hours.  I've been cleaning, but when I clean it always looks like nothing really happened.  I concentrate too much on detail, not the big picture.  I get lost in the small things.  Even from way up here.  Now I'm craving a can of Dr. Pepper, which I happen to have in my fridge.  Rock on!

      So...hi.  There's so much on my mind right now, thoughts flying everywhere.  And what am I doing?  Trying to distract myself from thinking by cleaning and doing drugs.  You know, the usual.  My head just started weirdly hurting.  I think I'm really fucked up or something.  I'm probably dehydrated as well - maybe I should drink some water.  Man, I'm really tired for some reason.  Maybe I'm just fucked up.  I did work all day today...well, not all day, but like, a regular workday.  I got up at around 7:40am (wow, I can't believe it) and was in town on time to catch the 8:40 bus! (That deserves some kind of recognition at least.)  That's not as bad as having to get on the bus at 7:26, but still, I was happy.  Work went alright I suppose.  I worked with someone who usually works at another one of our stores.  I was really high when I got there, and then I got even higher when the new girl from next door came to visit me and we smoked a couple more bowls right after I got done smoking a couple bowls.  It was pretty awesome.  I talked to her for a long time - I wish I had more time to talk to her today.  Next time, I hope.  I talked to my mom today.  I'm flying down to LA in a couple of weeks to see my brother graduate from middle school.  While I'm super excited to go down there and everything, this forces me to realize how fucking old I am.  What the hell am I doing with my life?  My brother is ten years younger than me, graduating junior high, and I'm doing what?  I was supposed to be doing something by now.  Something.  Fuck.  I keep thinking about A.  So much to say on this subject...I think I'll go wash my face.  And then clean or something.  And then maybe, just maybe, I'll force myself to actually process thoughts on this subject.  But, we'll just have to see about that, now won't we.

      I have been working all day, I'm kinda tired, and I want to get stoned.  All day yesterday I was worrying about running out of weed before I got more, and it seems like today it's been falling all over me.  I love when that happens.  I want to do something at least semi-productive for a little while (such as clean or something), and then I have tons to write about.  Toodles!

      Wow, it's been so long since I wrote an actual entry.  I guess I have just been occupied with other things the past few days, so I really haven't had much of a chance to write.  My friend is here right now, she's going to spend the night.  We met in Berkeley earlier tonight and fucked around, and then we came back to my place and got high.  Then we went for a walk.  It was pretty good exercise - it's kinda hilly around my house.  Then we did our toenails and I cooked dinner and we watched  urlLink The Rules of Attraction .  Man I love that movie.  Now we're watching vh1 and she's lying on the floor wrapped up in a blanket.  I'm probably keeping her awake actually, and I should be asleep already anyways.  I'm going to set my alarm for 7am, since I have to work tomorrow.  Suck.  My nose really hurts goddammit.  I want some ice cream.  I never finished my limo driver story.  I'll do that tomorrow I suppose.  I'm going to bed, maybe after a bite of ice cream...

      It's about quarter to 1, and I'm pretty tired.  Like, physically I feel tired, but I totally don't want to go to bed yet.  When I got home from work I cleaned my bathroom extremely throroughly, cleaned two of my pipes, and then washed some dishes and cooked myself some dinner.  Unfortunately I didn't get home from work until about 7:45pm (which actually isn't that bad, I just hate working), so now it's already pretty late.  Thank god I have tomorrow off...  Right now I feel too braindead to write.  Maybe I'll write more in a bit?

      Have I mentioned lately that my life is crazy?  I'm so mad right now that it's so fucking late...where the fuck did the time go tonight?  If it wasn't so late I'd probably write a lot more than I'm about to, so that will have to come tomorrow.  As I was waiting for the bus tonight after work, this limo pulls up and the driver appeared to be looking for something.  I was just sitting on the bench waiting for the 7:26 bus to come with this limo in front of me, fantasizing about not having to take the fucking bus and how cool it would be if someone rich and powerful was in that limo right there and took pity on me and wanted to drive me home in the limo.  I'm looking down at my sweatshirt and the remnants of the bean burrito from Taco Bell I spilled on it last night when I hear the driver say "Are you waiting for your limo?"  Yeah motherfucker, I always wait for my limos sitting at the bus stop.  I looked up and replied with something like "yeah right, I wish...I'm waiting for the bus."  He asked where I lived...Montclair, I told him.  He asked if I wanted a ride home in his limo, he had an hour to kill or something.  "How much will it cost me?" I asked him.  It's free, he told me.  So I got in the back, and my adventure began...

What ad do you see at the top of mine?  I just looked at my page and saw (there's two in the box at the top) one for an herbal vaporizer (hahaha) and another one for drug tests.  How funny is it that the main "idea" of my page is coming up as drugs and getting high.  How awesome.

      How else would I see the same video twice within a half hour?  It's that new D12/Eminem video for 'My Band.'  I'm sure a lot of people find it annoying but I love it...especially the salsa part at the end.  I just love the serious way Eminem stares into the camera while holding that jar of salsa with the dog running by and singing those ridiculous lyrics.  I want to be on whatever drugs he's on in that scene.  Plus, I love those hot pink sock-tight things he's wearing.  Gotta love him.

      So I just cooked myself another meal.  This cooking thing is actually pretty fun - I actually wanted to cook tonight instead of microwaving another frozen meal.  Mushrooms, zucchini, bean sprouts, and onions over rice.    Tim came over tonight for a bit, which was cool.  He and Patrick havn't been able to get any weed the past few days, so I've been having him come over to smoke with me (and to visit...I mean, we'd be smoking either way so it's all good).  We watched the first hour and twenty minutes of The Swan pageant (gotta love Fox dude), and then we decided to go to Safeway real quick and come back in time to watch the end of the show.  I thought I was only going to pick up a few things, but, since we smoked so much before we left, I totally kept getting distracted and wound up taking way too much time.  Now I have way more than enough food for the next little while, so that's good.  I kind of kept getting anxious because Tim was waiting for me and I was taking so long (one of my "things" is having people waiting for me - for some reason that totallly makes me start to panic), but I kept trying to push that out of my head. [pause right here: I'd like to interrupt to say they're playing the Outkast 'Roses' video  yet again .  Sigh.] We didn't get to watch the end of the Swan, which I guess doesn't really matter.  I was kind of only watching it out of some sadistic pleasure I was getting.  It made me feel really gross inside though...  I have therapy tomorrow.  I'm definitely going to talk about what happened Thursday night, maybe I can get some help in dealing with it.  Honestly I don't know what to make of it, but I seem to be best when I don't let myself think about it.  I know that's not healthy at all though.  We'll see.  I feel full, yet I totally want to eat more.  Story of my life, eh?  I think I just like to eat and have tasty things in my mouth.

       urlLink Ananova - Man sues guru over raw frog cure  An alternative medicine guru is being sued by a man who almost died after he was told to eat raw frog six times a day to cure a pain in his neck.  The man, identified only as Chen, went to the alternative medicine expert in China's Hunan province because of severe neck pains.  He was told to eat at least six raw frogs a day to get rid of the pain and had scoffed his way through 130 before he collapsed, complaining of stomach pains and headaches.  He is now suing after doctors discovered his body was riddled with parasites that had come from the frogs, the Xinhua agency reported.  ...maybe he thought he'd shit a prince?

      I just took this personality disorder test.  Here are my results:       Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    Low       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    Moderate       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Moderate       urlLink Narcissistic :    Moderate       urlLink Avoidant :    High       urlLink Dependent :    High       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    High       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --       Look how bright and red that last one is...obsessive compulsive.  Hell, I could have told you that.  Actually I already did.  Avoidant and dependent though, that's interesting.  Obsessive-Compulsive Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder is similar to obsessive-compulsive anxiety disorder. People with this disorder are overly focused on orderliness and perfection. Their need to do everything "right" often interferes with their productivity. They tend to get caught up in the details and miss the bigger picture. They set unreasonably high standards for themselves and others, and tend to be very critical of others when they do not live up to these high standards. They avoid working in teams, believing others to be too careless or incompetent. They avoid making decisions because they fear making mistakes and are rarely generous with their time or money. They often have difficulty expressing emotion.  Avoidant Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by extreme social anxiety. People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.  Dependent Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a need to be taken care of. People with this disorder tend to cling to people and fear losing them. They may become suicidal when a break-up is imminent. They tend to let others make important decisions for them and often jump from relationship to relationship. They often remain in abusive relationships. They are overly sensitive to disapproval. They often feel helpless and depressed.  Okay, honestly, I agree with the obsessive-compulsive disorder part.  I might be moderatlely avoidant and dependent, but nowhere near the extremes described here.  Another interesting thing I realized while taking this test is how much I have changed over that last few months.  A lot of the questions where I would have given one answer a few months ago totally don't fit me anymore.  Like the ones asking if I'm scared of being alone.  Was I at some point?  Yes, definitely.  Am I now?  Definitely not.  Shit like that.  I guess that's cool.  It's like I've become more sure of myself and my ability to take care of myself.

      I'm not feeling quite as lethargic as I was a little bit ago, but I am still pretty stoned and kinda tired.  I am almost (read: almost) motivated to clean up in my room.  But, not quite.  I somehow ate half of that pint of rock and roll ice cream, and even though I'm way full I still feel hungry.  I just want to munch I think.  I have a tiny amount of oxy left (definitely enough to get me fucked up)...I'm wondering if I should do it.  I do have tomorrow off.  Sounds tasty if you ask me.  Let's get out the ol' mirror and razor.  Too bad I don't have more, huh.  Do you ever read  urlLink Craigslist ?  Sometimes there's really funny shit if you look in the cracks and crevices.  I can't say I've looked anytime recently, but for some reason I just thought of it.  Actually I know the exact reason...once I knew this stupid girl who bought drugs from a posting on craigslist.  What a dumb ho.  When I thought "I wish I had more oxy," I reminded myself of her buying morphine.  People are fucking crazy man.

      I just cooked.  Isn't that awesome?  It's like I'm grown up or something.  Hah.  I sautéed some portabella mushrooms, green and red bell peppers, onions, and zucchini and made a little bit of pasta.  It was so good, I wish I had some more.  I'm so glad I'm able to cook again (in other words, I'm so glad I finally cleaned my kitchen area to the point where I can cook).  I'm suddenly paranoid that the 'Anonymous' person who sometimes posts comments is my mom.  I wonder if I should be worried?

      I wish I didn't have to work tomorrow.  The bus comes at 8:40am, so I should probably get up at about 7:30.

Shit, I've been awake for less than 10 hours and I already feel like I need to go back to bed.  I'm working with someone I really like...and it's only 10-5.  And she doesn't mind if I'm high.

       urlLink Bush Takes Tumble During Bicycle Ride  (you might have to register to read anything on this website, so I'll paste the article at the end of my post)  I'm sorry but this is extremely amusing to me.  Read the entire thing, it's pretty short.   Seems like Bush is a bit of a bumbling idiot, eh?  But hey, check out that part about John Kerry falling while snowboarding.  They should use that in ads to get young people to vote for him and get Bush out of the White House.    Bush Takes Tumble During Bicycle Ride   President Unhurt, Completes Course  By Dana Milbank Washington Post Staff Writer Sunday, May 23, 2004; Page A10    AUSTIN, May 22 -- President Bush, always a bit star-crossed in his leisure pursuits, suffered a new misadventure in athleticism Saturday when he fell off a bicycle.    The president was in mile 16 of a 17-mile course on his ranch in Crawford, Tex., when he fell from a mountain bike, suffering scrapes and scratches on his chin, upper lip, nose, right hand and both knees. But, true to form, Bush stayed the course: After getting cleaned up by the White House doctor, he completed his bike ride.   Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman, immediately offered excuses for his boss. "It's been raining a lot, and the topsoil is loose," he said. In addition, Duffy reasoned, "He likes to go all out. Suffice it to say he wasn't whistling show tunes." Fortunately, Duffy reported, Bush was wearing a helmet and mouth guard.   The spokesman warned that Bush probably would be wearing a bandage on his chin when he arrived here Saturday night for a party for his daughter Jenna, who is graduating from the University of Texas this weekend.   For the president, there is something of a history of hapless encounters with sporting activities.   Years of running gave him two bum knees that have periodically left him limping his way to Air Force One. In December, doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center examined him with X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging and, finding some damage to both knees, recommended "cross training."   In other words, exercise such as mountain biking.   In January 2002, Bush was on the third floor of the White House residence, watching a football playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and Miami Dolphins when he choked on a pretzel. This caused him to faint and fall, bruising and scraping his face. Bush was accompanied only by dogs Spot and Barney.   Then, in June 2003, Bush was visiting his parents at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, when he fell from a motorized Segway scooter. Bush, who was holding a tennis racket that may have interfered with his coordination, did not hurt himself -- but the incident was captured by photographers and quickly beamed across the world.   Athletic miscues are a bipartisan affair, of course. Bush's Democratic challenger John F. Kerry has, during the current campaign, fallen off a bicycle and taken a nasty spill while snowboarding. He blamed the Secret Service for the latter.   Bush's close calls predate his ascension to the presidency.   During the campaign in 1999, he scraped his right leg and hip when a truck trailer overturned near his jogging path in Austin. Bush dived for cover when chunks of concrete and wood were dumped behind him.   Around the same time, Bush went swimming in the pond on his ranch with his advertising strategist when the two men spotted cottonmouth water moccasins -- the only type of poisonous water snake in North America. That time, at least, Bush was not snakebit.    © 2004 The Washington Post Company

      So I met my friend in  urlLink the village  (it's a real village!) and we went to Safeway. Then we had to walk up the fucking hills to my house carrying our groceries. That always makes me think I'm out of shape...but really I think maybe I smoke too much (and I'm out of shape). Not fat, just unable to walk up hills while carrying about 10 pounds without breathing heavily. But hey, whoever said heavy breathing was bad?   I'm stoned. We got high when we got home, which definitely eased the trauma from walking. I realized as soon as leaving Safeway that I have no oil or anything to fucking cook any of the vegetables I bought in. Damn. I guess I'll just get high and eat some frozen lasagna instead.   I got a friendly reminder in the mail today that it's time for my annual pap smear! Yay, I can't wait. I hope they don't drug test me. I mean, it's the same doctor that prescribes me cannabis (hah) so I don't think THC in my system would be a big deal, but maybe other things would...?

      ...but at least I'm stoned. Right?   So yesterday, this guy Patrick who used to work down the street from me until he got fired about a week ago came back to the store to visit me. &nbsp;He worked at Noah's, and I guess his boss accused him of taking $600. Did he do it? I don't know, he says he didn't but who knows. He just turned 18 a few weeks ago, and he has 420 tattooed on his left wrist, which I think is all too awesome (but what about when he "grows up" and wants to join the "real world"?). Last week, the day he got fired (maybe it was Tuesday or something, I honestly don't remember), he ended up getting super drunk and passing out in our backyard. (Our store shares a backyard with Ritz Cameras.) I had given the Ritz guys a disposable camera I took from their store to develop for me (for free, naturally) and Patrick took like every single picture that had me in it. Anyways, when he showed up yesterday randomly, he happened to open his wallet for something and the first picture in his little plastic picture thing that people stick in their wallets was me. ME. As in, one of the pictures of me he stole he took the time to cut to that size and put it in his fucking wallet. I totally have some weird effect on people...honestly this isn't even out of the ordinary for a day in my life. Like the day when the random guy on outside my work came up to me and was staring at me, so I yelled at him "Um, do I KNOW you?" "No," he said, "but now I have your picture!" he said as he took my picture and ran away. He returned the picture of me to me about a month later, which his number on the back. However, it had been crumpled kind of like he was squeezing it in one hand as he jerked off with the other. See what I mean?

      Shit dude.  Now it's like 12:40am and I'm still up.  I think I'll go wash my face.  Right now I'm smoking a bowl and listening to some Missy Elliott.  I'll be back, most likely.

      Kim just left. It's about 11:30, and I have to get up by 6am tomorrow. Hopefully I will actually get up instead of letting my alarm go for about 2 hours before I decide to do something about it. I guess that means I shouldn't do any oxy before bed, that tends to make me especially comatose the morning after. Unless I get to sleep for at least 12 hours, that is. I'm going to try to be in bed by midnight (which seems doubtful to me, but let's think positively) so I can be up by 6 and leave the house at around 7:15 to catch the bus at 7:26. Then I will be at work at around 8:26, which will give me time to get coffee, count the money, and maybe do a line or two in the back room. Haha, just kidding.  So I cleaned up my kitchen area a lot and finally took the double burner I bought out of the box. I cooked for the very first time since I've moved in here! It was very exciting. Simple, but exciting. I made some pasta - I was just excited to be able to have clean dishes to do that, let alone a clean countertop and space to do anything. Yay.   I'm smoking a bowl and I just did a line...I think I'll do something productive for about the next 5 minutes.

      So I took a shower.  A really long one, it was like 45 minutes long.  I would have stayed in longer, probably, except the hot water supply was rapidly diminishing.  I shaved my legs, but only until just above the knee.  Again, I would have gone all the way up had there been more hot water.  Oh well.  What's up with that anyways?  I can't believe it's already after 6:30.  I feel like I wasted another whole day.  I really should clean up something in my room.  I realized last night as I was pulling pots and pans from a box that I packed all my shit up just about a year ago now.  And I'm just unpacking pots (I still have a lot more boxes) so I can wash them (who knows about using them).  Hmm.  It makes me think maybe I don't really need all the stuff I have in boxes if I've gone a year without it and still have no motivation to unpack anything.  I should sell everything, maybe make a little bit of cash.  That would rule.  Okay, I have to go get dressed and whatnot.  I don't know why I feel the need to update this everytime I do something today, but, you know, whatever.

      So, it's 4:30 on Wednesday afternoon.  I just got up about a half hour ago - 3:54 on my alarm clock to be exact.  Yes, I had set the alarm for noon...and I repeatedly hit snooze until I actually got up almost 4 hours later.  Nothing unusual for me there.  Thank god I have the day off - I worked six days in a row before today.  And let me tell you, that sucked.  Working retail that many days in a row, I start to hate people, hate their questions, hate their comments, their clothes, their attitudes...but I still love their money.  I wish I could just take all their money.  And oh do I try.  I'm trying to decide what to do right now.  My choices are shower, sit here and fuck around on the computer, sit here and do something other than fuck around on the computer, or maybe not sit here but not shower and instead clean my room or something.  And my room really, really needs to be cleaned.  I don't know what it is with me.  I have some kind of aversion to cleaning my room.  More than most people.  It's not like I just don't like cleaning, because I do...I think there's some kind of psychological issue going on here.  I tried bringing it up in therapy like 2 weeks ago but I wasn't really sure how to explain myself.  But she definitely agreed it's the opposite end of the OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) spectrum from where I used to be.  Ah, the brain.  How much fun you are to deal with sometimes.  I think I'm going to hit my pipe and see what happens and where I end up.

      So here I am, yet again.  Up way too late, yet again.  It's times like these when I think to myself, what the fuck am I doing with my life?  Do I have any direction whatsoever?  Then I usually hit my pipe if it's around to shut those voices up.  No seriously, I am worried about myself.  How the fuck is it already almost June of 2004?  Why the fuck am I still working at a retail job I took "temporarily" last August?  I mean sure I've been promoted a few times and now I'm assistant manager, so I guess that's a reference at least.  Right?  Sigh.  Where's my pipe?  A friend suggested to me (a few times now) that I volunteer as a counselor and work with troubled kids or something.  That would let me work with people and help them, and plus it might help me get into grad school.  Which is totally what I want to do at this point, but I feel like I wouldn't have the best application.  Yeah, I know I'd be great for whoever wants me, but how the fuck am I supposed to prove that within the narrow guidelines they use for choosing people?  Someone else might look better on paper, when I know I'm better.  Or am I?  Of course I am.  I guess I have some kind of direction.  Grad school, straight ahead.  I feel like there's so many little pieces of my life that I have to take care of before I even decide on a direction.  Maybe that's just how I fool myself into thinking everything's okay and I can be immobile forever.  I don't want to grow up.  Maybe people feel like that their entire lives, that there are so many things that need to be taken care of before they can move forward in their lives.  Maybe not.  I guess I need to just go forward - as in, decide what I want to do with myself and then start going towards that - and take care of all the little pieces along the way, instead of just pausing everything.  But seriously, I think I needed some time to regroup and collect my life and thoughts and everything and take a break from everything.  Decide what I want to do with myself right now and in the future.  Obviously I don't want to do retail my entire life.  I'm better than that, and besides that, retail sucks.  I would, however, own a business.  And I would definitely not run it the way the owners of the company I work for run theirs.  Let's just leave it at that.  Okay, so what do I want to do?  Go to grad school.  Pay my outstanding bills.  Maintain my intelligence and sanity.  That was a long flow of thought...one which flows through my mind every day at least a few times.  I don't even know if it made sense.  Wow I have so much to talk about.

      Boy am I high. I had to work today, which sucked, but really it wasn't all that bad. It was pretty slow so I didn't get stressed out like I all too often do.&nbsp; Then I came home and took some oxy, and smoked some pot, and did some more oxy, and smoked some more pot, and I'm still continuing the cycle. The weird thing about me and oxy is that instead of making me feel all lazy and tired, it makes me want to get up and do shit. I've already cleaned some dishes (which seriously is a huge accomplishment for me) and started cleaning the bathroom. Let's talk about that for a moment. I have this problem where I get easily distracted...I always want everything clean, so I start cleaning one thing and then realize something else needs to be cleaned so I'll start doing that and then I wind up starting so much that nothing ever gets done. Then it looks worse than it did to begin with. Sigh. This is something I need to work on.   I went to this crazy concert on Friday night at the Fillmore.  urlLink Peaches . I honestly still don't know what I think about it. All week I was wondering what the fuck to expect...and when we finally got there (Tim and I), I probably couldn't have even imagined the diversity of the crowd. I don't really feel like going into it right now. But, it was interesting, to say the least. Don't get me wrong, her music is great. I think really I was just wishing I had some certain drugs...   I'm all itchy.

I feel really fucked up right now, I think maybe I did too much oxy.  By too much I mean like more than I would usually do so I feel more fucked up than I am used to.   urlLink Here's the quiz.     you are the "you're so dumb" happy bunny. you are brutal in your words and enjoy putting others down.     urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Where's my snare?

      My typical day is such a rollercoaster of emotions.  What the fuck dude.  On one hand I totally want to go into it and write all about it right now, and on the other hand I just want to snort some more oxy.  Sigh.  I wish I didn't have to work tomorrow.  I'll write more in a little bit.  Maybe.  I do want to, I have a ton to say.

      Yeah, we're straight, we get high on our music...  Not me though, I get high on drugs.  I worked today...it seemed to go by extremely fast, too fast almost for me to even get anything done that I wanted to.  Yet at the same time it seems like this day has been going on forever.  After work I actually went to the bookstore to buy that new  Star  magazine about M-K but they didn't have it.  I guess it's too low class or something...but they have  Us  and  People !  What the fuck.  Nevermind that my work (the salon) actually subscribes to that magazine...I wanted it today, dammit.  TODAY!  Man, now I'll have to wait or something.  Fuck.  Care for a line, Mary-Kate?  Something smells really bad in my room, yet I don't have the energy nor motivation to find the source of the stankiness.  Maybe in a little while...  Man I just realized how funny it would be if I actually documented all my terrible customer stories.  Maybe having them all compiled and together would help me realize how much stupid people suck sometimes.  Oh wait, I already knew that.

      Looky here, I'm awake.  Must be some kind of miracle if you ask me.  I got here at about 9:30 this morning, stayed up until, ohhh around 10:30, and then fell asleep (not even on purpose).  I woke up at like 12:50 when I got a phone call, and then looked for awhile at the bus schedules so I could go to therapy at 3:30.  All of the ways they were telling me to get there were ridiculously complicated, so I decided that I would call up my therapist and ask to reschedule for sometime when I can just leave from work.  (I had already been leaning in that direction...I hate taking the bus, and I hate taking unknown bus routes even more.)  She said that was fine, so now I'm going on Thursday instead.  Yay!  I get to leave work in the middle of the day, but then I have to go back.  At least I get to leave work though and split the day up a little.  I'm gonna hop in the shower.

      So I ended up going back to sleep earlier.  I'll only nap for an hour or two, I told myself.  Seven hours later I finally woke up, showered, and now here I am.  Man, I hate when I do that.

      So I was looking at my blog a second ago, and I couldn't help but notice the banner ad at the top of my page (provided by google based on keywords in my entries, yay) and the main two links were both for alcohol and drug addiction recovery.  Um, okay.  There were also two little extra links under that...one said 'Kim Deal' (this is awesome); the other said 'crack cocaine.'  Google must think I'm a crackhead obsessed with Kim Deal and I need to recover or something.  Great.

      Wow.  It's like, twenty minutes to 10 on this Monday morning, and I'm asking myself repeatedly why I'm awake.  I slept at A's last night (as has been my current trend), but we weren't able to fall asleep until like almost 5.  He had to get up for work this morning; I, having the day off (thank god), merely had to get up so he could take me home.  Usually in these types of situations I instantly go back to bed as soon as I walk through my door, but today I felt like I should stay up and maybe be productive or something.  But now, sigh, I am starting to get tired again.  Perhaps I should make something to eat, like an eggo, or have a can of my favorite pick-me-up elixir, Dr. Pepper.  Maybe I should just take a shower and get on with it.  We did a little bit of oxy last night too, and I remember getting paranoid that I would die in my sleep.  I promised myself I wouldn't mix all those drugs at once anymore.  We'll see what happens.  I am so excited that I have today AND tomorrow off.  Two days in a row!  Awesome.  Lots of blogging will occur.  Oh, the toaster's ready for me to insert my eggo.  Mmm, syrup.

      Recently I was driving (when I rented a car last week to drive to LA) and I saw a car with a bumper sticker that read "Our governor can terminate your governor!" or something to that effect.  Funny, but sad.  Very very sad.  Didn't Ronald Reagan become governor of California because he was an actor too?  These people should stick to their bad movie acting, and leave the political shit to the other bad actors...er, politicians.

      I haven't written all week!  Since Tuesday!  Sorry.  I guess I've been keeping myself busy, or I've just been unable to write for whatever reason.  I've been spending a lot of time at A's apartment, so I haven't really been around...and even though he has a computer, I don't really want to sit and blog in front of him.  I worked today from 10-5.  I got home about an hour ago, and now I feel really tired.  I'm eating a leftover vegetarian taco I got for lunch but didn't eat at the time - black beans, salsa fresca, guacamole, cheese...the usual.  No meat.  Yum.  Check out this pic I took with my phone on the way home from work today.  It's a bus that is painted to look like a giant sandwich.  Hmmm.   urlLink    eat me!  I'm gonna eat my taco!

      I feel like I haven't written anything in, like, forever.  I mean, I have, but I haven't really gone deep inside my head.  It's 11:30 on Saturday night, I'm watching Joe Schmo 2 on mtv (I thought this was on Spike TV?), and I'm eating a Smart Ones Rice and Beans dinner.  Yum.  I worked today, I worked tomorrow, but I didn't work for the last three days.  The reason for that, my friends, is that I went down to LA for a few days to visit my family - my little brother was graduating from 8th grade.  My fucking nails are too long again for me to type comfortably - it seems like they grow way too fast sometimes.  I guess that's better than them not growing.  It just seems like I have to cut and file them all the time.  This show is fucking hilarious, btw.  If I remember, I'll write more in a little bit.

      Hey, with Reagan dead, that means the whole "just say no" anti-drug campaign is dead too, right?  Man...I remember being like 5 years old and seeing all those dumb anti-drug commercials.  Obviously they did absolutely nothing to curb my drug use, but sometimes I feel bad when I snort stuff.  I'm completely fine with smoking pot all day long.

      I am really fucking high right now.  What a beautiful day boys and girls!  After getting really depressed last night, I went to bed around 11:30.  The depression mixed with the sedatives I had snorted made me pretty sleepy I suppose, and besides that I just didn't want to be awake any longer.  After being excited all week about A coming home, the incredible letdown that occurred just made me want to end the day as soon as possible.  I knew he was coming home last night, and I was totally planning on seeing him (of course).  He called me at around 8pm or so to say "hey,   just left San Francisco so they shouldn't be here for about 30 minutes, and C [his friend who he went on the trip with] is in the shower, so I have a little time to see you."  I was completely insulted at this - I'm not important enough to have my own time?  I have to be hidden from his "real friends" and squeezed in miniature time slots between his other plans?  Fuck that dude.  I told him no, I didn't want to see him like that, it made me feel really shitty and unimportant.  (This is weird btw, since I usually let him walk all over me.)  I wanted to see him when I wouldn't have a ten minute time limit and he wouldn't have to rush out and pretend he wasn't just with me.  "What the fuck??  I'm offering to come see your ass and you're going to bitch about it?  Fuck that.  You know what?  Fuck you!"  I'm sure he continued along those lines, but at that point I hung up.  Fuck him for talking to me like that - I did absolutely nothing to warrant that kind of response, and I'm not going to sit on the phone and listen to him behave like that.  Besides that, I didn't even say anything wrong, it seems pretty logical to me.  He was apparently extremely offended that I didn't want to drop everything and see him for seven minutes and 23 seconds.  So, I did some random stuff around my place and went to bed.  I cried and cried, and eventually fell asleep.

      wouldn't it be cool if that said what a long day of fucking?  I woke up at around 7:45am - much later than I had intended on getting up.  It probably had something to do with all the ativan I crushed up last night and snorted lines of until I couldn't stay awake any longer - come to think of it, I was still pretty groggy when I finally opened my eyes in the morning.  I didn't have time to shower, so I washed my face and then crushed up another ativan and snorted it.  I put on some makeup quickly and then my coworker was here to pick me up at around 8:12.  We got to work at around 8:40 - she dropped me off in front of the store to turn off the alarm and clock us in while she found a parking spot.  While she did that I crushed up a couple more pills in the breakroom and snorted those, and then I went out and tried to be coherent.  I was very relaxed and unstressed, I'll tell you that much.  Sedatives are great.  Actually, I think drugs in general are great.  Sedatives are great because they allow you to just calmly deal with what's going on.  So on with my day.  I made our daily rounds to Starbucks to get my iced hazelnut latte, stopping at Ritz on the way to say hi to whoever was working.  David gave me another 1-2 grams of weed as a gift.  At first I was like how much do you want for this, and he was like nothing it's a present, and I was like no really...he just wanted to give it to me.  I don't get it, but I do like free weed.  David's nice.  I made some dirty money with my coworker...we're so shifty.  Went in back and snorted another pill in the break room.  Borrowed a friend's car to go to my therapy appointment at 3:30pm and talked about a lot of issues, which was good.  Smoked a bowl in his car, which if he knew about he would kill me.  Went back to work, my boss left, and then I made some more dirty money.  Being weird, I took about $40 in $1's just so I can enter them all into  urlLink www.wheresgeorge.com .  I'm strangely addicted to that site recently.  Then I got extremely stoned in the back yard with Megan from Ritz (she's a total hippy) and her boyfriend Rob, and bananaman Luis.  Went to Oscar's for a veggie burger with Megan and Rob, and then they dropped me off.  Now it's like 9pm, and I'm fucking tired.  And crushing and snorting another ativan.  Details to follow!

      So I have been retaking these enneagram quizzes at various times for a few reasons - it was recommended to take the tests at least several times and see what you get the most and what is most accurate, as your mood may be different at different times, thereby affecting your answers.  Makes sense, right?  The one you get the most should be the most accurate for the test taker.  Here are my results so far:   First:          Conscious self

      I think I should snort ativan every time I need to do something.  That was great!  I mean I'm definitely still feeling it...but I was totally able to go do everything I needed to do and not feel weird about it or try to convince myself to do it later like I usually do.  It's like some kind of underlying anxiety that prevents me from getting shit done.  Where is that coming from?  But right now that anxiety isn't there...I've sedated it enough to where I actually feel productive.  Go me!  Plus, I feel so relaxed and peaceful...

      I need to run some errands. Drop something off at the cleaners, refill some prescriptions, deposit some checks, buy an onion. Get a latte, duh. I am really fucked up right now - I decided to snort two pills of ativan (lorazepam), and now I'm on my third. I usually take one a day to mellow me out a bit, but damn I am fucked up right now. I'm also semi-smoking a bowl (trying to conserve, I only have about 1.5 bowls left). The ativan drip in the back of my throat is sweet tasting - not bitter like that associated with coke. I hope I'm able to function out in public right now...

      So I just put on more Fake Bake.  I don't know why, probably because I'm drunk, but it seemed like a good idea.  I think I put on too much , so maybe it will look way artificial when I wake up tomorrow.  Either that or streaky, since I'm so fucked up.

      Someone told me yesterday that she loved my hair color - it's very exotic.  I pointed out that she's a dumb biotch, since I'm white as fuck.  Lol, just kidding.  I used to be until I used that Fake Bake the other night.  I slept with it on and took a quick shower yesterday morning.  I was very concerned it would be streaky or orangey, but it actually looked really natural.  There was a part on my upper right thigh near my ass where I saw some streakiness, but no one else can see that high so it doesn't really matter.  I think it's gone now anyways.  I kind of want to do it again tonight before I go to bed - I hope it won't look more artificial.  I only did it on my legs, because if I fuck up I can just wear pants - if I fucked up my arms, wearing long sleeved shirts would suck in this weather.  Okay, more soon.

      Have you ever heard of that website  urlLink Where's George?  where you enter in the serial numbers of the cash you have and it tells you where it's been and shit?  It's pretty cool, I have been hearing about it forever and just always felt like it was probably pretty lame, but now I can see myself kinda getting into it.  I just entered in like 12 bills.  Do your own!

      This won't be a long post...tonight's Friday night, I have tomorrow off, and I plan on doing nothing all night.  Chilling, getting high, and possibly cleaning if I somehow find the ability to motivate myself to do said activity.  I want to post lots of short little blurbs tonight about whatever I'm thinking at the time.  The guy from AG Ferrari's came to the store today to say hi to me and check shit out.  I knew he was interested in me, I just knew it.  I just get that feeling when I go in there.  But that's cool, he's pretty cute actually.  Maybe I can fuck him in the back of his store.  Or my store, like I did with the guy from Starbucks.  Hmmm.  AGF guy is studying creative writing at SF State.  Interesting.  He's really into writing fiction.  I wonder if he smokes pot.  Probably, if he's into writing fiction, right?  I hope so.  Hmmm.

      Do I even have to tell you?  No, of course not.  Unfortunately a quick shower is just not Bustily possible.  Okay, actually, it probably is, but tonight I wanted to shave and exfoliate and whatnot so I could try out some  urlLink sunless tanner  I got from work.  It's taken me awhile to work up the nerve to try it - generally I'm scared to use such products out of fear of turning my usual pasty white legs into more of an orangey muddy color.  Let's hope this doesn't happen this time.  I'm also paranoid of the streakiness.  I'm planning on wearing a skirt tomorrow - hopefully I won't wind up having to wear pants.  Wow I totally forgot I was writing this.  Now I'm tired.

      So I just got home from work a little while ago.  It wasn't too bad...the day went by pretty fast until my boss and I had to leave to go to a class on this new line that Sebastian is releasing called Body Double.  There were about 8 or so of us there at the class, and at the end, the educator asked us 10 questions about what she had just told us.  Each right answer won us a dollar; I won $5.  I knew the other answers, I just felt bad and wanted to give other people a chance.  God, people are so dumb.  It's really not that hard to repeat something you were just told, is it?  But I guess this class was a little bit different than the ones I took at Cal.  Now I'm home, doing drugs, preparing to be productive.  I want to clean...

I shipped out that shit to my friend, bought tampons and a paper towel holder from Rite Aid, bought some ketchup and butter from Safeway, and got my iced venti hazelnut lowfat latte.  Yay.  I wish I could have two days off in a row, that would be awesome.   urlLink    Here's one of the signs I was talking about from Safeway.

      Let's list my dumb little errands.  I have to buy tampons, first of all.  While that may sound like it sucks, I'm actually very happy for this, as it means once again that I am not pregnant.  Thank god.  This reminds me of the fact that in Safeway, in the aisle with the tampons and pads and 'sanitary napkins' and whatnot, the guide thing hanging from the ceiling that says what that aisle contains doesn't say 'feminine hygiene' or 'feminine needs,' like I've so often seen before.  No, it says 'novelties.'  Hahaha.  It's a novelty is it?  It's been around for thousands of years fuckheads.  Seriously though, I get a kick out of their little labels for random supermarket shit.  'Can Vegetables.'  'Cook gadgets.' (This is supposed to be cooking utensils and shit.)  It's like some little asian gnome went around and built all their dumb signs and just fucked shit up bigtime.  I also have to mail some shit to my friend.  He better be grateful.  Oh, and there's the necessary daily latte as well, can't forget that...

      I finally got out of bed at around 2pm.  I had set my alarm for 11am, hoping to not sleep all day like I usually do on my days off, and besides that I knew I was supposed to be in Berkeley for therapy at 3:30.  I wanted to get up and be productive...after all, that is my 'thing' - being productive.  Maybe that's because I feel in general that I am entirely too unproductive.  Anyways, I woke up at 10 and called my friend to talk about some random shit, and then wound up going back to sleep until I got up at 2.  I hit snooze about 5 billion times just like every other day - quite honestly, I'm suprised I haven't smashed my alarm clock to pieces in my sleep yet.  I took a shower which ended up being about 37 minutes (haha, "about," you know I totally looked at the clock) - and that was with me trying to not take too long.  Damn.  I realized there was no way I could be in Berkeley for my appointment anywhere near 3:30, so I called and left a message saying I missed my bus and I was really sorry but I couldn't make it.  I dried my hair, put on some moisturizer, threw on some little shorts that I wear around the house, and now here I am.  I'm smoking my first bowl of the day, and already I am completely stoned.  When you smoke as much as I do, it's not really a matter of getting high anymore, it's more like, "what can I do to maintain my constant high?"  Waking up and then smoking doesn't just get me really high, I feel like it actually renews my level of high-ness from at least the night before.  It reactivates the high levels of THC flowing through my body already - so, instead of me feeling like I just took 3 hits from my bowl, I feel like I've been smoking for awhile and the few hits I just took are just added to that.  Wow, I'm really high.  And this Dr. Pepper isn't helping.  I feel like I can hardly think.  I have some dumb little errands I have to run, and then some not as dumb shit I need to take care of, but I usually put that kind of shit off.  Maybe I should get dressed and put on some makeup, yes?  Fuck.  What to do.

      So today at work this guy came in asking for some semipermanent blond toner.&nbsp; I was really the only one there who knew anything about what he was talking about, so I walked with him to show him where it is in the store.&nbsp; I got this weird feeling from him, but I&nbsp;attributed it to&nbsp;me being incredibly stoned.&nbsp; But, whatever, most guys probably feel weird coming into a beauty salon, I&nbsp;figured.&nbsp; Then he started saying how much he liked my hair, and he even touched it at one point when talking about what color he wanted his hair.&nbsp; "You have really nice hair," he said.&nbsp; "Oh, thanks."&nbsp; I know I have nice hair, silly, silly boy.&nbsp; I wasn't exactly sure about the instructions for what he was getting since his hair was already bleached, but I tried to help him the best I could.&nbsp; I hoped I wasn't telling him to do something that would make his hair fall out or fuck anything up, but I was pretty confident I wasn't.&nbsp; There were a billion people in the store, he waited in line, I rung him up, and then&nbsp;he left.   A couple hours later,&nbsp;the store phone rings.&nbsp; My coworker&nbsp;who answered the phone&nbsp;told me that someone I helped earlier was on the phone for me; I was silently hoping he didn't go home and follow my instructions and then all his hair fell out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it was nothing like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi, I'm Roberto, you helped me earlier, what's your name?"&nbsp; So I told him, and then he was like "well I really think you're beautiful and I'd really like to get to know you better, maybe I can give you my number and we can go out and get a drink sometime."&nbsp; Alright, I said.&nbsp; It's not like I couldn't just take his number from him over the phone and then throw it away or something.&nbsp; And plus, he went through the trouble of looking up the store number and calling back and asking for me.&nbsp; On the phone he said something about really wanting to ask while he was there, but there were too many people and he was nervous or something.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like I have some stranger power of attraction that either attracts complete stalkers/weirdos, or just causes people to behave as such.&nbsp; Or just that weird things happen to me pretty consistently.&nbsp; That's just how my days normally go though...

      Today seemed like a long day, although I guess it wasn't that bad.&nbsp; I had to be at work at quarter to 9 to open the store in the morning, and since I slept at A's last night (yes, there is definitely a correlation between the amount of time I spend over there and how often I post), I had him drop me off at my coworker's since we were opening together.&nbsp; The manager and I were supposed to have an interview with some girl at 11, but she never showed up.&nbsp; Bitch.&nbsp; One of the registers broke, but then our other coworker brought In-N-Out, so that made things seem a little better.&nbsp; The manager and I hung up some random pictures in the bathroom (one of our favorite things to do is take weird pictures when we're supposed to be working).&nbsp; I left early to go to therapy, so that was cool, and then I took the bus home.&nbsp; No one tried to sell me any weed today!&nbsp; I guess that's good, I hate being bothered.&nbsp; And of course I'm not going to buy some dumb weed off some dumb guy on the street.&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; It's funny, I don't even look like a typical stoner.&nbsp; Most of the time at least.&nbsp;&nbsp;All this talking about weed is making me realize I haven't smoked all day...I should pack a bowl!&nbsp; Yay.   My room is a fucking mess. &nbsp;I need to clean it, but the idea of that is just so unappealing to me.   Okay, I'm going to try to motivate myself.&nbsp; Perhaps I should offer myself a reward.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

Following news that Mary-Kate has anorexia, the ads have now been canceled 'out of sensitivity for her situation,' according to milk marketeers the Milk Processor Education Program. Claims in the Star and National Enquirer that Mary-Kate is also battling cocaine addiction - which her reps vehemently deny - no doubt also detracted from the advisability of showing the girls with a white substance on their upper lips."   urlLink    mmmm, "milk" (I got this picture from  urlLink defamer )

       urlLink ExtraTV.com : Moore and Stern Take On Bush   [btw, I'm totally annoyed at blogger right now, it seems like I keep posting things, and then when it comes time to publish them, I get that dumb page that says the page can't be loaded, and then my whole entry is lost.  What happened to any sense of stability?  I'm mad that my entries keep getting lost...]  He's likely to become one of the most influential men in American politics -- and he's not even a politician. Michael Moore's scathing anti-Bush film, "Fahrenheit 9/11," has earned more than $60 million at the box office, and Time magazine made Moore this week's cover boy.  According to Time Senior Writer Richard Lacayo, Moore's movie could potentially cost Bush a second term in the White House. "Moore's been able to make this film very quickly and drop it right into the most potent moment in the election season," Lacayo insisted.   "Fahrenheit 9/11" paints the president as incompetent and uncovers Bush family connections to the powerful Bin Laden family. Meanwhile, the Bush camp has called Moore's film a "pack of lies." But in attempt to be fair, Moore set up a "Fahrenheit war room" to deal with the accusations of inaccuracies.   Moore has even employed former Clinton administration officials to deal with the media blitz. But it seems that the director has got a new best friend in his mission to remove Bush from office -- radio icon Howard Stern.   Stern has been on a daily radio rant against the Bush administration, saying he's been unfairly targeted by the FCC for indecency. So could a Stern/Moore team be enough to get the president out?   Lacayo told us it's amazing how much these two could sway the election by working together: "Taken together, Michael Moore and Howard Stern are both at the top of their industries: radio and film. They both have an enormous audience, and together, they'll be punching away until Election Day."   With four months until the election, there's still plenty of time for campaigning and plenty of time for America's newest power couple to make an impact. Meanwhile, Moore is already eying his next target; he will focus on HMOs and the healthcare system in his next documentary.
