      ok, ok ok. i was in the computer lab, and i go to read this and die, and grace looks over and says, "the we hate meredith club? is that yours?" and i said, "oh no, this is..." and she saw antoinettes name. so i was like, "ummm, thats not the meredith from school though. this is another meredith." i hope she bought it! anyway, i have to go. because if my advisor finds me goofing off, she'll kill me.

      OK, i'm finally posting, and getting this whole blog under control, because right now, all we are doing is writing notes to eachother. email people! i love getting mail, all kinds of mail, just not blog mail. so anyway, i have to study for history, and for french. its 958 right now, and margaret is taking a stupid shower. she wants me to wake up at SIX OCLOCK to stay with the kids and watch over them. we have to drop zack off at our family's friends house at 6 50, and drop jordan off at 700. then, margaret has to drop me off at school, and she will probably skip it, because she has to do all of this picking up junk for my mother. and so yes, i am going to be exaughsted tommorow, and i don't even know if i'll be up to making hot chocolate to walk down the halls with antoinette! because i need to take a shower, and i barely have time for that! i need to shower! but when? tonight? if i wait for tommorow, than some freak could come in and steal the kids! so tonight? but margaret is in the shower! darn it! my life is cursed! and don't forget the tests, oh no! mrs. heins just decides to keep the test, instead of making it a quiz. oh, and i just now remembered. we have homework in history. so i'll leave now to do that!

      Ok, ok, i made it to the computer, so i will now be writing a long blog because i am so bored in this house. So, sorry that i haven't written in a while, but my other blog(s) have been taking up much too much space. I had a revelation yesterday, and i found out, that i view bob and margaret... and tim i guess in a totally different way. now it seems to be like, hey, instead of, hey you guys want to go watch a movie or something, with me, together, like now? grr.. nah, i don't know what i will do. i won't know until i see him again.

      ok i havent posted in a really really long time so here it goes, ah hem, ok, i am SOOOOOOOO SAD!!! :-( i want to curly up in a little corner and rock back and forth in my feeble position until my eyes are drained from all the tears and i have falled asleep from depression because everybody else in the WHOLE GRADE (actually probably not) is at jordan's party. Ok, i don't actually feel that bad. the only one of those emotions listed above that i am feeling is lonliness. i wish y'all were here spending the night which i am sure you will never be able to do which would make me really really sad. but don't worry about me, im sure i will get over it...eventually. ok i will move on to  a happier subject....if i can think of one....hmmm....i am having some trouble....well i was talking to bess...that was happy----------------------but then bess had to leave to go to dance class and hasn't gotten back yet. so i guess that makes me sad too. i rented a spongebob playstation game and it turned out to be the most boring thing i have ever experienced in my short, sad life.ok must think happy thoughts! mush think HAPPY thoughts!!ooo! ooo! i know i know! my happy thought is, i can talk to y'all tomarrow! yay! only about 12 hours to go!!!! tty in 12 hours!!!!

      happy now i am posting ok i will try to make it as long as possible. oooh oooh guess what i am going shopping today after school for an outfit for jordan's party and i will probably have to use all the little amount of money that i have and i can't believe that you are making me write a long blog darn the longness i think that you're fight with katie was actually kind a stupid and i dont care if i have a lot of typos because i dont really care ;lalalla now you are singing the scary baby song about the poopy diaper i really want to know whats for lunch because i am starving but i still have to write a stupidly long blog. you know what i am really upset b/c i have a spanish test on monday and my grandparents left today and i forgot to say goodbye and now you want me to finish so i will now

      hellooooooooooooooo!!!!!!! is anyone out there? can anyone hear me? am i just all alone in this small box that they call a GROUP BLOG!!!! i mean really now people, would you like to see who the last 5 entries were entered by? thats right, ME and the one before that which was from antoinette. Go antoinette!! even though that was a pretty long time ago. ok i put my adress for my website on hear and you silly fools will never be able to see it if you don't wisit our unhappy, lonely, little blog once in a while. and just so you know, the adress is \, again, www.ilovemenotyou.blogspot.com.....and that pretty much sayd it all now doesn't it? well i really hope that there is something good for lunch today because there wasn't anything good yesterday but that is ok b/c we had our little history thing and i ate like a big pink silly PIG! as you can see i am runing out of things to talk about and so i am talking about random things...AHHH right now there are a few freaks behing me playing a pink song....AHHHHHH ok i am posting on my blog.

      when antoinette wrote like a month ago i think she was right, we should invite katie to the group blog thing. not that it is even a group blog anymore anyway. now it is more like the other caroline blog because caroline is the only one that posts on her blog AND on this blog. but nobody would know that because they dont visit this blog anymore and if they did then they would know the adress to my blog wich i posted down there somewhere. and just to let ya'll know, i won't be posting for a while b/c of my cruise so i will try to make this entry as long as i can but that probalby wont be very long anyway. oh and anto-i wrote you an e-mail yesterday and you havent written me back yet and that makes me sad. you didn't go anywhere for christmas did you? or did you go to houston or something? AHH i can't remember! julia, you didn't go anywhere did u? all i know is that kat went to her ranch.well if ya'll are home then we should go shopping or something, oh wait, im leaving tomarrow...AT 3 IN THE MORNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i think i will go insane. well we should all go shopping when i get back, if i have any money left... and then i can give y'all ur presents!!!! i only need to buy kats present and julia's.....i already have antoinettes. ok well ill see ya when i see ya.....bye!

      ha ha! since nobody has updated in a while, I'LL update. maybe somebody else will get the hint that EVERYBODY else is slacking off in the updating department. so anyway. not much has been going on. katie kind of freaked me out. she thinks that i am jealous of her, and it is actually the opposite. her life is kind of depressing and my mom says that she has been very mean lately. she complains about EVERYTHING and she is mean to her mother. i mean, she thought her mother was the one who was mean, well, she is just as mean to her mother if not more so. her moods change so often i feel like i'm in a gosh darned marry go round. she takes things much to seriously and gets happy and depressed so quickly i never know what mood she'll be in. i hope antoinette will come back tommorrow, because she's been sick for a while, and i have to update on gossip. gosh darn it. i hope she won't pout and be upset this study hall.

      yeah i think we should have that whole "write once a week" rule thingie. well i really don't wanna read anymore of 1984 cause i think it is like the most boring book that has ever been my misfortune to read! and i started writting my journal on Flatland and the journal thingies really aren't that bad to write...ive already written about 200 pages and its like not even half a page yet! so thats really good and all but now i have to go write a stupid "thanks for the stupid cake" letter to some lady

<post>

	 
      hey you guys i know that no one is going to read this but i feel like hey i have written in like a year so what the heck. i think that there should be a rule that we have to write and read at least once  a week otherwise this blog is a huge waist! so anyway summer has been pretty fun and i still have to read 1984 and write my journals but i figure hey i have like a month and a half right and i can't read 1984 anyways b/c my sister is in the middle of reading so i guess i could write my journals or something i guess that that is what ill have to do. hey you guys i am really bored we should do something sometime i mean school starts soon and i don't want to go so i need to take my mind off of it! okay i will write later...hopefully! i hope that you guys do to!

       I have to clear something up. Mary thinks that i don't like burning music, i just read her blog, and i think she hates me for that speech. but the thing is, i'm a horrible hypocrite. I burn CD's all the time. do i really care whats going on in the musci industry? heck no! i just wrote that speech to make the judges happy (no offense.) Anyway, so now that that is all cleared up, i can be a happy camper again. mmm... camps...they're happy. weee. just being scary. its late. that explains all.

       Well, not much has been happening. I got a little letter from mary. And i almost cried because i got this ten dollar bill, except it was all wrinkled, and i felt all guilty because i have been so materialistic in the past, so now my sister thinks that she has to pay me money in order to make my birthday a good one. And i just looked at the wrinkled little thing and wanted to send it back, but i knew that she wouldn't except it, so i had to put it in my piggy bank with a cloud of remorse hanging over my head. Sorry, i had to read Anne Frank, i'm in the analogy mode. Hee hee. well i'd best be off. i have lots of stuff to do. jules

Oh well, at least its over. i only got four things for my birthday: a paul frank back pack, a paul frank shirt, a tiffany's bracelet and a tiffany's necklace. Awesome! well, i have to go. this computer is meant for school work only. Jules

Geez... what should i do? but you know what? no matter what place i get, i still get a big patch to sew on to my blazer. cool huh? I'd better go and work on my speech. wish me luck! PS, the next time i write, i'll be telling you what place i got, and it'll be over with. then you won't have to hear about it any more! yipee!

       So, I'm sure that you have all heard about my speech contest thing. I'll write it all out right now.  "A burning Issue" Everyday, millions of people around the world log on to the internet in order to download songs. the things is, they are destroying the music industry. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of web sites such as audiogalaxy and the now shut down napster. But lately I haven't been taking songs off the internet and putting them onto a blank disc, also called burning, because my conscience has gotten to me. I have been asking myself, "what is the difference between getting free songs, and stealing CD's from a record store?" the answer is, nothing. Today i want to show you the two sides of the fight for free music. It all began when a teenager invented a web site that allowed anyone to share music. the reason this boy had originally made this web site was to allow independent bands to put their songs on line. Eventually, major music artists appeared on this web site and a whole new way of getting music was born. Soon a name for it appeared, Napster, meaning name calling, and it rapidly caught on. Millions of people began to go online sharing files and getting so-called "free" music. However, not all of this could last forever. One rock band, Matallica, became angry because their music sales had dropped rapidly. Soon, Napster was shut down, but this didn't stop other people from making sites identical to Napster. Now, there are hundreds of web sites that give away "free" music. Let me now explain to you the pro's and con's of all these web pages. Many people support web sites that give away music. First, Many don't like the "big bad" music indrustry. There are greedy music record companies that don't give their clients the appropriate amount of money that they've earned. When we buy CD's, we're supporting those money-hungry people. Secondly, you can buy a pack of 100 blank CD's for about 7-10 dollars, but one music CD costs around 15 dollars. Why pay more money for something when you can get it for less? Lastly, its convenient! when your at home, you can download songs, burn them onto a blank disc, and pronto! you have all your favorites in just a small amount of time. on the other hand, downloading free songs can seem like a bad thing. Like i said before, its stealing! in my opinion there IS no difference between walking into a record store and taking a few CD's, and burning CD's at home! Secondly, if we don't buy music directly from the artist, then they'll lose money. If songwriters dont' get money, then how are they supposed to make songs? If too many people start downloading music, then maybe musicians as we know them will stop recording all together! Lastly, after September 11, people stopped going out and shopping as much as they used to. We need to boost our economy, and keep people like musicians in jobs, otherwise the employement rate might fall. So whats the big difference between ten dollars and fifteen? At this time, MP3's and CD-R's are invading store bought CD's. Sure, some people are really big fans of a band, and they buy their album, for their personal CD collection, but not enough people are. in a poll taken by CNN, blank CD's for burning music sold more than original CD's by the artist. So what side are you on? are you for websites such as napster? or are you against the whole "burning issue?" you decide, but remember: honesty, is usually the best policy.   so what do you think? I worked really hard on it. just email me and tell me what you think: JJones@mail.hockaday.org

       Ok. I haven't been able to post anything for a long time because my class and i are leaving for West Texas on may 6-10. So at this time, teachers are trying to pack in as much homework as they can. Therefore, i don't have a lot of spare time, because this is my last chance to boost my grade. Secondly, my birthday is coming up, the 22nd, and i'm turning fourteen, so i've been caught up in that. Also, i have been spending quite a bit of time with my friends, because i need to. and today, i found out that i made the finals for the middle school speech competition. So now, i don't have to perform it just in front of the grade, but in front of the whole middle school population. Plus some parents and faculty. Great! yepee! i'm freaked out of my wits. You know, its 1030 and i probably should be in bed, but margaret won't let me, because she has to download songs onto my computer. In this case, i'm going to have to wake up at 610 so that i can take a shower, because my hair is all grubby and stuff. So tommorow i will be really tired. Now i have to go to feed my pet carrott (just kidding.) bye! -Jonesy -- Jonesy is the new nickname that margarets friend came up with. Its rather catchey... Jonesy. hee hee.

       Hey! The internet sort of got installed in my room. Well it did, but it goes at a snails pace. Well, Chicago was awesome. I got to meet all of mary's friends. Very cool. I met Adele, Russ, Jason, Tom, Nick D., Ginny, Anne, and thats about all. Mike wasn't there, and i was so sad, because i really wanted to meet Mike. Anyway.I went to the Fields museum and it was awesome, I saw the exhibit on chocolate. We also went to an aquarium. I got to go to the billy goat tavern, you know that SNL skit with the guy yelling, "cheesbouga cheesebouga!" yeah, well i met the real guy me- hi, uggghh, can i have a cheesburger please? the guy- you wanna double cheesbouga? me- no, no, just a cheeseburger. the guy- no double cheesbouga? me- no ah- the guy- but double cheesbouga's ah de best. me- no, just a cheeseburger (the man looks destressed) me- i'll also have a pepsi... the guy- no pepsi, coke. me- oh, ok, a coke. and, doyou have french fries? the guy- no fries, chips.  me- oh, ok, then the chips.... it was so much fun. Even though on the trip i acted like a brat.. hmmm. and i got a pair of converses. so cool. as mom would say, "kick'n it old school." well, i'd better go. Hey adele, why haven't you put my name on your/mary's blog? i'm hurt....:(

I have science in ten minutes. Nothing much esle is going on. I have to finish my history homework, and i know i'm going to fail my math test because i don't understand any of it, and i miss the review session before the test. yeah, i'm really lucky.

       yeah, well, margaret was yelling at me about getting on, when she "really really" need to use it. i tried to get on at school, but the computer i chose took forever to do anything so yeah. Oh! today i planned out (sort of) what i'm gonna do on my birthday since it's coming up, April 22. I'm going to invite Katie-Beth, Bess, and Danielle O'bannon over. we're probably going to go to a mall and dave n' busters or whatever (katie beths idea), and then probably KRISPY KREME! yeah baby. then we'll probably watch monty python, legally blonde, and we'll probably rent some movies before hand. I'll open presents (if i get any this year) and we'll probably bake brownies. fun fun fun! i know, i'm a master when it comes to fun. it's just my nature baby. oh, pancakes! byeya!

       I am SO bored. Look how many blogs i do in one day! three! Mamma Pajama! You know what? we're going to leave t o eat at Joe's pizza, i think. I don't know because my dads temper thing is going on, and he's in a really bad mood, where his face gets all red and blotchy and he yells at people a lot and he doesn't ever hear what your saying. for example, when i gave him this whole humorous speech about something today and i say, "see?" he goes, "what?" and it just made the whole thing lose its glam and funness and i was just like, forget it. Anyway, i had track at school today. oowwww.... my legs are soooo sore. Now, if i can just keep this kind of thing up, and maybe do some dance/ballet in my room, i'll be seeing improvments in  weeks. i go up to visit mary on Friday, and i'm really excited. i finally get to meet all of her friends. I've always wanted to meet them. Dates to remember: Thursday, April 4: GRAMMAR QUIZ (do not fail this one) Monday, April 8, perform SPEECH! and some other stuff that i have to memorize, including stuff from to kill a mockingbird and vocabulary. I don't think that theres much more to talk about. Margarets taking a shower. Mom's putting the kids to bed. Yipee... i got a computer. i think i already told you that, but oh well. Adios amigos (even though i don't take spanish...)

       what i'll never understand is why mary never writes in her blog like a normal person. i mean, she puts other peoples blogs up and then she'll say a few things, but thats about it. I mean, hello? what ever happened to family? why doesn't she write about us? Anyway, thats not the point. The point is that i want to go and eat at joes pizza, and it is so funny, because it's my life story. You see, Joe's used to serve really good pizza. but I don't like the pizza there, so i always have the spaghetti, which is pretty good. well, like almost all restaurants do, they started doing well, and cheapining their products and making th crust soggy. the thing is, they started changing the spaghetti, and i think that it's better.  well, because everybody else eats the pizza, they decided not to go anymore. now isn't that ironic? it so is. Anyway, i gots ta go. i have to write a speech on the Andrea Yates thing. bye bye! JULES

       so now i'm at school and nothing much is going on. i eventually went to costco, although margaret threw a huge fit, and yeah. anyway, spring break is over, and as jason would say, well i can't exactly remember, but it was something about a farytale being over and it was really funny. i can't remember marys blog address and its rather.... sad. its somthing mafia. oh well. i got my french test back and i got and 87.5, and i think that that is the second best in my class. i wouldn't know because emily dunlay wouldn't tell me her score. anyway, nothing much else. i have to go and play ink link even though it won't connect and i'm really bored. You know what? bess says that i should say something about peanut butter and strawberrys so i said it so great. you know, i'm not sure i understand blogs, because i mean, who's reading this? no one! i mean, who cares about my life? thats not the point, the point is that this is a venting system, and its good for me. ink link isn't working so i'll keep on typing until it does. i think that if i don't leave soon i'm gonna miss lunch.. hee hee. i don't have a phone jack in my room, so ummm, i don't know when i'll be able to write again. we're supposed to get DSL soon, and that way, i'll be able to have a wireless connection. pretty cool huh? my family's never had a fast connection before, so this will be great for us. I'm going to miss lunch i know it! no one is listening to me! i don't understand why we have lunch so early in the morning, 11:15! thats just too early! lunch is in the single digit zone. not 11 ish. well, i'd better go. Isn't it terrible about what happened in czechnia? czechniaa? - bridget Jones' diary

       so one of my sisters, margaret, is being a complete jerk. my mom is going to costco with some people, and i wanted to go, so my mom says, hey. we'll all go, and obviously my sister can't handle that because she wants to be all by her self, with these people. So anyway, she's saying that i've never done anything for her (wich is a complete and utter lie, because i have been her slave all my life.) and that if i'm gonna be decent i should stay home with the kids while she goes out because she never gets to go to costco, nooo. i don't want to watch the bloody kids. plus, costco is the coolest and i must buy the shakira CD (its a long story) and i have to buy a romance novel for mary, the oldest sister of mine in Northwestern. ughhh... anyway, i don't know why i should be all high and mighty to margaret when she has been such a jerk to me for so long. gotta go, i hear her calling...

I thought that it was really really funny. so i go to my sister mary, "man. thats hotter than a mexican radio!" dude, right next to her is some spanish guy and i'm like, oh shoot! and ugghh.. it was really embarrasing and stuff. plus, margaret threw ice at me.  :(

Hee hee. anyway, tommorow i leave for a church retreat thingy. no CD's. can you believe that? well, anyways, i have to go, because it is midnight and i am tired and things. Jules

I find myself very loud. and obnoxious. so anyway... Mom and the little kids have left for france. we'll be leaving on the seventeenth. the house is really quiet. everyone here is just doing there own thing. i don't have anything else to do. so i went to my room. anyway, i'd better clean it, before bugs start to live here. wooops...

The one that you embarrased yourself in front of? I hear that you are not excited to come home and see me. It is so sad. I love you so much, and i miss you so much, and i know that i am a careless necessity that you must talk to once a month to please her. like someone in prison or something. yeah. i'll see you soon my little chiquita bannana.   girls camp was awesome. yeah, but i have to go. bed or something like that.

       Well, Provo is super fun. Our cousins, Lauren and Jeremy are really nice and a lot of fun to hang out with. I think that they might be getting tired of the little kids though. Every morning they ask to play LIFE or MONOPOLY. So yeah. We saw about a boy and it was really good, i thought that it was an adorable movie. Hugh Grants hair looked especially adorable. So my mom is in the kitchen making cookies, mary is who knows where, margaret is spacing off, and jordan and zack are asking my mom if they can do things. Hopefully today we will be able to see goldmember. Is it good? Anyone? anyone? I'd better go, i'm using up money, and that isn't nice at a guests house. bye Jules

(not to be mean katie, but i just thought that that was weird.) anyway. I'm tired, and i have an english grammar test tommorow. i hate grammar.  margaret is in her room doing who knows what, and i've got to go.

       Katie, there are some things that i don't think you get. I had no choice about moving to the south. It is fine here, it's just that on that particular day, i was really missing some of the places that i've visited. Dude, i just don't think that Texas has much culture compaired to some of the other places i've visited. i've looked all through dallas, and all through fort worth, and i don't find anything that APPEALS to me. don't jump to conclusions about things that you don't know the complete answer to. i think that sometimes girls dress up too much, and show off too much, when they are young. i just didn't like that. and that other person you don't have to care. i just talk to you like your my diary, so if this is the way that it's going to be about this other person. than i'll just stop talking about it all together. and also, you've never seen me around this other person, so how would you know, and call me a hypocriteok? i was depressed that day. big deal. sometimes, its human to have MOOD SWINGS. earth to brent, i don't think that you get what i was saying. you do have mood swings, and often, no offense. but i only have these "depressed" mood swings once in a while. for petes sake child, i was JUST DEPRESSED. deal with it. i've been hanging around down people all week, and that is why i came to school quiet and tired. antoinette and caroline re-powered me, and thats why i was hanging around them. sometimes, you've just got to let go, and get a break. do you understand now? Mary, what is a word that rhymes with, speghetti. ask your italian friends, they'll know. i'm triying to post a blog that i made on saturday, but it's not working right now. it is really weird, and very critizising, especially to mary, but i was just venting and trying to deal with the fact about mary changing and going to college. anyway, i have to go, because i'm at school.

       Well, I'm sure that no one reads this, because i haven't updated in a while, and my life is oh so boring. Anyway. not much has happened. Mary went  back to college, i got braces, and i realized that i sound like a nerd on blogger, because i'm always so... ugghh. just too happy and stuff. or maybe i'm just in a bad mood because i'm at school until margaret decides that she has no more questions about AP chemistry. and i have to do my math homework, along with my science homework, which i can't do at school, because the materials are at home. so. there you have it. margaret got braces today, and she stayed home from school, the jerk. she got to go to costco with the missionaries and everything while i stayed at school. margaret said i had no friends because i'm so mean, so. i guess that shows you my day today. not much, as usual. Smith has been over a lot lately, but only because his compainion has a cartiac in his eye, so they can't do much. i don't mind though, because smith is my best friend, and of course, i am not one of his, but that is ok. he's just really nice to me, and makes me actually feel like a person instead of a robotic babysitter/"witch to my sisters"/jerk/stressed out/ugly/too talkative freak. anyway, i'd better go and get on that math homework due tommorow.

       ha ha! i am at school and i have play practice from 345 to 800. darn it. but katie got a new cell phone that i voice activated, so we'll play with that when we're bored. and we have dinner at 400. darn it! i don't eat dinner that early. i'll come home hungry. i got some weird email from smith. no bloody idea what he's talking about, but i expect a response sometime soon, or i'll ask him. no worries. Life is hectic, but fine. i'm worried about mary, slightly, but not enough for her to be concerned about me being concerned aobut her. i know she's all good. gotta go. i have a stupid pumpkin decorating project. darn the pumpkin ness.

       well, margaret wasn't at there house. mhmm... again, julia is mistaken. she was errr... i forget, but she wasn't there. anyway, mom and dad get in tommorow, and i am so excited. my life will be back to normal. and i won't have to watch twice the amount of kids. anyway, its been an exciting week. i mean, not school wise, but play practice wise, because we perform next week. can you believe that i am actually scared to say two lines? but i have to say them with energy! gosh, i hate that cheesy look they make you wear. i mean, we sing "hooverville" which starts out, "today we're living in a shanty, today we're scrounging for a meal" and we're supposed to be smiling and vigorous when we sing. does that make any sense? i think not. anyway, i better go. i just had like four eggos and i'm feeling kinda woozy.

       I am in a whir of confusment. I know that mary said i shouldn't care about smith, but we went over to visit them the other day, you know, to take them out to dinner, and tonight margaret came into the room. i asked her simply and kindly, sort of randomly, where she was going, because she seemed to be... ready to go somewhere. and she said, no not at all, that she was working on some papers. i go to ask her a question 5 minutes later, and i'm calling her name. she doesn't answer. so i go to look outside, and lo and behold, her car is gone. so, i'm trying to get all this advice for rain music, so i call the most music-est person i know who should be home, smith, and their not there. i'm guessing she went out again tonight. which makes me sad, because she should've told me the truth. she just yelled at me about lying and about her being violated, when she goes and violates me. it's simply not right. I have to wake up very early tommorow because i have play practice at 830AM. i don't think i'll make it there on time. Better go, i've got to make my CD. Julia

       I don't know why i keep on feeling like i should post on my blog. but i do. Margaret is out having lunch. i asked if she was taking the missionaries and she said no, but i don't believe her. i then asked her if she was lying to me and she said no, and she said that she had never lied to me. HA thats a joke. Antoinette called today to see how i was doing, and i thought that was very nice of her. She wanted to know why i wasn't at school, and i explained that i was sick. i still don't know if i should go tommorow. i'm very torn.  margaret=confusing Mary just told me she called all depressed like. i never know with her, because she won't talk to me, and she hides too often to find out if anything is wrong. for all i know, she's in her room listening to creepy music, lighting candles, and writing poetry. creepy www.capitalistmafia.blogspot.com=cool just talked to mary again. she's like my physciatrist, without a day to day talking/emailing with her, it's hard. she knows lots of stuff, so i try and listen. this time i was complaining about being a doormat. i used to like a lot of people, and the longer their gone, the more i realize how mean they've been to me, and how many bloody favours i do for them but don't get in return, and how rude they can be, and how they disregard rules, and how they don't realize how their words affect people. you know? i'm bloody sick of talking about them, i'm bloody sick of putting up with the junk they tell me, and how RUDE they are to me a lot of the times. sure it's great when i get a day when theyre nice, but 89% of the time, they treat my like a load of rubbish. ah, the beauty of realizing this, is such a great thing. thank goodness for breaks.

       Today i'm sick. well, this morning i didn't feel good, i felt like i would vomit, and i got NO sympathy from margaret. so, i'm getting better, but kerri wants me to stay home tommorow to help with the kids. she said she'd call the school and everything. i don't know yet, what i'm going to do. i feel like i'm on my own in this house. no one to talk to, and no one understands. i talked to my friends brother last night. he wasn't nice at all. he even said, "away with you foul wench!!!" i thought he was nice last year. but it's ok, i don't like him at all in that way. he was very mean, and he lost any respect that i might of had for him. moving on, i'm baking cookies right now. the sky looks like it should be in chicago, and i love it. i want to go and visit mary up north, and see her new dorm, and go to gios, urban outfitters, pannera, and the converse store nearby. evanston is the coolest, and people from northwestern rock! mom and dad come home in six days, and today is my half birthday. i think kerri is trying to sneak pills out of the house and that = no good. i hope not, because i thought she was really cool. i better go. before she comes in here, julia

       school=fun after the horrible french and history class, my advisory decided to have a pizza party. so, for lunch today i had "cinni sticks" cheese pizza and coke. ah, the goodness. after that, i went to play practice, where i did scenes from the radio show, let's go to the movies and a new deal for christmas. In between the play, antoinette, caroline, katie and i all goofed off throwing food at eachother and listening to music. i killed a huge and scary bug with orange legs. it was sick. then i talked with some other "pops" (the popular people, they came over most likely because we had food) and they started looking through my CD case and saying how great weezer was and how they loved phantom planet. sure, i'm sure they really love phantom planet (sarcasim is the key to understanding my blog.) so anyway, all day i thought about how people i don't know very well care about me (i.e. mark, and mary's other friends) while people at home who do know me well are evil to me (i.e. margaret, smith) about things such as, me needing to call the orthodontist and having margaret and smith say (when i say i'm going to go) "it's ok, just push mute again" like i'm listening to their conversation. ha! like they ever talk about anything productive, i'm sure! mark, i do very much appriciate that you care about me, that's like a symbolic blanket being laid over me, knowing that someone cares. i really do need more hugs! but it's all good. my friends are awesome, and grades are good. mom and dad are safe in rome, and mary's discussion avec moi was very supportive because it showed me that i should be independent. thanks mar. so anyway, i'm hopefully a better person. unless this is a phase, but i don't think it is. better go, later, Jules

       thank you mark, for helping me snap back into reality and realize that this is not a drama show (and thank you to mary too). sorry if i've seemed a little out of sorts. i'm pretty mad at margaret because she won't work at all, and it's upsetting me that she can get away with that.  i made cookies today but i burnt them. darn my bad timing i don't want to go to school tommorow. that means that i have to wake up, and be nice to people and smile a lot. it also means that i have to obey a dress uniform code. darn it. i'm going to go watch clock stoppers.  julia

       well, mom and dad are in rome right now, so kerri, my aunt is babysitting. she has some anger problems, so she got kind of angry at the missionaries because they "wouldn't work at all" but what makes me angry, is that my mom told her that they wouldn't be helping around the house a lot, and that they just slump around. and so they won't be coming back until mom does! whatever. i went shopping with antoinette and caroline and it was really fun. but while i was at the mall, i realized how fat i've let myself get, so now i have to work out and try to eat healthy and all that. only problem is, there's no time, and mom won't let me jog outside because i might get raped or something. anyway, i got the "my best friends wedding" soundrack, and margaret says that i've sold out. whatever, i think its good. anyway, i better go, because i have SO much to do.

       so, i'm happy, i'm hyper, and i'm going to take a shower, and afterwards, i'll STRAIGTHEN my hair. oh yes, straighten it. the beauty. i'll be so bored tonight. actually, theres a ton of stuff that i could do. i mean, i could write in my journal, take a long shower for once, blowdry and then straighten my hair, clean my room, do my laundry, email people, clean out margarets car, burn CD's, download songs, get stuff together... oh yeah! that's what i was going to say! the reason i'm so happy is because mom said that i could go on a road trip with her and zack. a bonding experience! i love stuff like that! the missionaires might come too, they decide tonight. anyway, thats why i'm so happy. i love driving in the car. i listen to music, i look at the sceanery (spelling?) i eat food, i watch movies, but mostly listen to music. if i could find my cross stiching, i would so do that, but some how it's dissapeared. anyway. thats my story. mom comes in tonight, at 1030, so i'll probably see her. i'll watch a movie or something. anyway, i should probably go. there's much to do!

       ah, i didn't wake up at six, my sister let me sleep in until 640! she came home with the missionaries. things between me and smith are lightening up, but i don't know that for sure. he finally broke up with jessica, and her response was, in my opinion, really funny. but i won't say, in case of getting in trouble with someone. anyway, not much else is going on. this is my last day of school, b/c i don't go tommorow, b/c it's grandparents day, so i'm staying at home and babysitting until my aunt kerri comes. she's cool, mom calls her my twin because we both have tempers and we both have the same sarcasm. yes, it should be fun tommorow. i'm going to do my laundy, if only i could figure out what to wash white with and what to wash the colours with. anyway, since i'm at school i'd better go..

       i'm also sick of being happier at school than at home. and i know that i have already stated this, but, hey what the heck, its really fedding me up. i have play practice that is way intense this week, i want to scream but i can't. i want the world to dissolve away for just a little bit, and let me run around and do whatever i want without a stare, or without a look of confusment. i just want to be me, but i feel like i'm constrained in a straight jacket at home. at school i have so much fun with my friends. we work together, we talk, we walk, we shop, and do all that fun stuff. i get home. the missionaries are there, and i'm sick of wanting to be smiths best friend, i'm sick of competing with margaret, i'm sick of late nights, i'm sick of crying, i'm sick of missing mary, and i want to move to new york, just find some apartment, settle down and get a job, or something like that. i'm sick of this horrible weather, i'm sick of stupid people, i'm sick of all it. i just want to curl up in a ball and cry, but i don't have the time, because i've got a french and history test on wedensday, i have to get makeup for the play, bring fresh clothes for the play, clean my room, do my homework, go to all the play practices, write in my journal, take a shower, study for something else, and all those other stupid things that i have to do. i'm sick of not being me.

       this week has been ok. i'm still trying to figure out why smith hates me, but other than that, things were OK. dad's mother died, and i feel so sorry for him, because his eyes are all teary, and he never cries. so, i don't know how to handle the situation. anyway, i'm having more fun than at home, which i find odd, because your supposed to feel more comfortable at home. but i don't, i just worry about getting ridiculed for something or other, and about blah blah blah. i hate the feeling. anyway, i'd better go. later.

       well, yesterday and today (will) suck. i heard my sisters conversation through our paper thin walls, and it wasn't good, because it was about julia's "wierdness" and how i went to the grocery store yesterday and brought the kids just "because i was jealous that margaret might have a good time" and how i "had a major crush on rowbothom" and was this "news to you?"yes, and this morning she was asking me what my problem was, and she wouldn't leave me alone after asking a mill, thou, hundred times not to ask because i didn't want to say. so anyway, i told her that she couldn't solve anything unless she would buy padded walls. and she asked if i thought i was crazy. and i said no i don't think that i am crazy, but i can hear through the wall. and she obviously didn't catch on to that so i told her to think harder, like say last night and she said ohhh. and then she explained that smith and patterson were upset because i "tagged along with them to the grocery store" and how smith talks to me like a child and margaret like a ho older person. i am going to go now, because i am at school, and i have class like now ish.

       I love my sister. ah, the missionaries were over today, you see. and around them she's nice and cheery and does things with out complaint. although the minute they leave, "julia! your not done with the kitchen!" "julia, get out here NOW" "JULIA!" ughh... so anyway, today was OK. i thought that i was going to have to stay home from school because of lack of sleep, but i pulled through OK. antoinette, caroline, katie, and i read a fashion mag. that had lots of really cool stuff in it. i've been leaving katie out a lot, and for that i am sorry.  i have to go and clean the kitchen, so more later.

       i hate today. i want to die. it was alright in the beginning of the day, until margaret said that scott had some stupid song thing at saint marks. so, she asks mom to take her. well it sounded like fun, and i wanted to go, so at the beginning of dinner i asked if i could go. the response was no. so i clean up, work hard, and want to watch a movie like we did last sunday. when margaret gets the idea that she wants to bring the missionaries along. yah! my day just got ruined. so, smith and patterson and mom and margaert all get to go to this stupid thing, leaving me at home with a bunch of sleeping kids, and my father who has to do stupid college applications. i know that it is a stupid thing to cry my eyes out over, but i worked hard today, and all i wanted to do was have a little fun with my friends. i've had enough of everyone leaving me at home and saying that i'm a kid and treating me like one.  I hate myself and i want to die- kurt cobain.

       tonight was fun. no, i didn't get to make out with anyone, but. smith and patterson came over today, and the story of today goes as follows: (in army time) 1030 mom comes home and i think it will only be her and the kids, but no. two more kids were in the back with her. the MISSIONARIES. so they come in, but jordan has to go to a party at 1400. so  i go upstairs, and talk with sunny for a bit, and then he says, "jules, i've got a plan. do you want to help me?" so i said sure. he takes me to the toy room, and we count tapes, and then, smith sets up an excel chart. we then take out a movie, write down the title, it's catagory, the rating, and it's producion company. then two o'clock showed up, so we took the whole fam. to the galleria. zack, smith, and i went ice skating, and jordan did too, while dad and patterson watched and margaret and mom went shopping. sunny is actually REALLY good at ice skating, and zack was too. i'm the only one who was bad at it. we went around and around and got yelled at a few times before we got off at like 1600. jordan stayed on while everyone went to johnny rockets. good stuff. then i really quickly ran up to the louis vuitton store and got a catalouge with all their bags and stuff. then we left for home, and did more organizing, we still have some more to do. margaret got all dressy dress for homecoming, and scott came over. i said some stupid stuff, margaret left, mom gave me the "don't say stupid things around other people" talk, and so yeah. that was my night.oh, and i called smith and talked to him for a bit. but since it is 2330, i have to go.

       tonight i went to spirit night, i think for the last time. I went to a friends house before hand, and she blowdried and straightened my hair. it is so straight and shiney! i then got dressed, and we left. oh, and i/mostly my friends put a little bit of eyeliner on. nothing big. anyway, not much happened. i fell on the spikey grass, and it really hurt. then i called william, because he was "sick". no, no. he was not sick. he was HIDING IN HIS ROOM AVOIDING US. and we KNEW it. his mom had to tell us to stop calling. we then got nacho's and coke and looked around at people. and talked, and said things in spanish. actually, antointette said phrases like "you are a pimple" in spanish, and i would respond after her and point to the person saying, "si!" it was fun, and we now have more inside jokes then ever before. i missed patterson's birthday party, and i feel bad about it even though everyone says that i shouldn't this also screwed up my "seeing smith and patterson for 30- days in a row" thing. great. i SCREWED IT UP! anyway, i feel pretty tonight. i wish i could download some pictures of me, but i can't find the thingy. anyway, i'm going to watch a movie on cleopatra, and study all of the ancient egyptian ways we have learned.

       i hate days like this. i had fun at school, surrounded by people i like, and i talk to. but when i get home, it's a totally different story. Mom, Smith, and Patterson were watching the last few minutes of rush hour, so i watch it with them. then, my mom gets in one of those moods that i hate. margaret is in her room doing homework, and mom catches me, and gives me thing after thing to do, without a break. when i ask for one, and sit down, she would say something totally embaressing about me. i hate that so much, especially because she has no problem saying anything about me, so she had no trouble talking about how i won't wear "these shorts because they won't let my "cheeks" hang out of them" or how she can see "my budding breasts" the phrase that i despise of the most in the world. UGH! so i'm doing this work, and her attitude is making me more and more fowl, and i just want to scream. during all of this, margaret is doing her homework and smith is in the shower, while the kids run around. smith leaves, and so i get cornered into going to the park. yipee hooray! so i play basket ball with patterson, which wasn't bad at all, but we get home. and i go get ice cream with dad, jordan, zack, and patterson, while margaret does homework. then, we get back, smith returns from his appointment, they watch a video, and low and behold, margaret just doesn't have anymore work to do all of a sudden! how does that happen? so margaret leaves to see some dj and mom makes me work again, and lets everyone see the worst of me. because i am definatly NOT nice when i'm working while mom is in one of those moods. so. thats my night. i still have math to do, but i don't want to do it. i don't want to go to school tommorow.

       today i was depressed again. what is my deal? mom, margaret, me, jordan, zack, smith, and patterson went to CPK-- California pizza kitchen. anyway, smith bought us all dinner, which i thought was very nice, and have to remind myself to thank him. anyway, i didn't talk all dinner, and was very quiet, and i had no clue why, and i'm sure that i puzzled and vexed everyone at that table, with my fireworks of different emotions. anyway, we order dessert and i get a brownie hot fudge sundae, and of course i get fudge all over my face since i cannot eat ice cream, or any dessert for that matter, without getting it on my face. so mom goes, "julia, you have hot fudge all over your face." and i get so sick of hearing that, so i said, "fine, lick it off for me then." woops. all of a sudden, the whole table rushes towards me, and my mother gives me this huge, slobbery kiss thing, in order to take the hot fudge of. when i think its all over, and i'm looking at the lights above me, i see smiths head pop into view, and he licks my forehead. i swear, everyone has licked my face... seriously (note to all you, i AM sarcastic.) anyway, we leave and i see margaret and i lean on her and say, "see margaret? i just want to be cuddled, thats all." and once again, a crowd of people rush over and hug me. i appriciated that, because i love hugs ever so. anyway, we're all hyper after that (by the way, before all this happened, dad had come, eaten, and taken the kids home) and margaret says i can have the front. so i get in, still laughing my head off about this huge hug my mom gave me, and i said, " i love it" so mom goes, "oh julia, you are so funny! let me give you a hug!" in this high voice, and smith goes, "no even better," then he comes over to sit on my lap and goes, "let me go on your lap. i just want a hug, give me a hug julia!" and he wrapped his arms around my neck like a baby. i was laughing so hard, it was hilarious to me. anyway, we leave and my mom keeps on saying that everything i say is so funny so, "let me give you a hug!". then we turned on eminem and got home, and i did homework and wrote this blog, and today antoinette gave me nice capizio shoes (or whoever) and i love them so much, and it was fun today. but my mom won't let me go to spirit night this friday, and this is seriously the last one i need to go to, because i promised anto. that i would meet someone there. anyway, i'd better go, but i just wanted to get all my hype out, because today was so much fun after that whole depression thing.

He was a boy/ and she was a girl/ can i make it any more obvious?/ He was a punk/ and she did ballet/ what more can i say? He wanted her/ and she'd never tell/ but secretly she wanted him as well/ and all of her friends/ stuck up their nose/ and they had a problem with his baggy clothes/ he was a skater boy/ she said see ya later boy/ he wasn't good enough for her/ she had a pretty face/ but her head was off in space/ she needed to come back down to earth/ five years from now/ she sits at home/ feeding the baby she's all alone/ she turns on tv/ guess who she sees/ skater boy rockin' up MTV/ she calls up her friends/ they already know/ and they've all got tickets to see the show/ she tags along/ and stands in the crowd/ and looks up at the man/ that she turned down/ he was a skater boy/ she said see ya later boy/ he wasn't good enough for her/ now he's a superstar/slammin on his guitar/ to show her pretty face/ just what he's worth  anyway. i'm sick still. and elder pattersons parents are leaving tommorow. and his dad kind of creeps me out, because he's sort of like larry nelson, with the back rubbing, and touchy-feely ness. i just don't like it man. anyway. i'm bored. and exaughsted. i mean, out of wits end. i am SO tired. this has probably been the worst week for me, in my entire educational career. jeez.better go. i've got stuff on. actually i don't, but i am really bored of typing, so i'm leaving. known around the house as: jules, julia, jul-iA (patterson and his thick north carolina accent.)

       Hey, at school and its tuesday. i hate tuesdays. maybe even more than i hate mondays. maybe because it is the fact that i have already had one hard day of school, and then i realize that i have to go through wedensday, thursday, and friday. darn. And i am in a stump. dad wanted to go camping this friday, at the state park, with me, zack, jordan and him. well, my friend called, and told me that antoinette said she could FINALLY sleep over at her house, and my other friend, caroline, and me. well. when i told dad, he got all sad and pouty and in this sighed voice said, "well, life is full of tough desicions. you've got to choose." Well? what am i supposed to do? he said if there was a cold front, that we might not go. so i have no idea what i'll do. well, school is over, so i've got to go home.  Julia Jones

       Well. tommorow is friday. FRIDAY!!! And i still don't know what i'm going to wear to junior assembly. Oh? you don't know what that is? I'll explain. It is this dance/ party sort of thing that a few private schools join together to do. We have it 3 times a year, and its only 8th grade. this time, its a western theme. i thought i would be wearing a jean skirt and boots, but i didn't know my shirt. danielle informed me that the boots the was going to let me borrow, were getting repaired, so now i don't know what i'm going to do. i don't know what i'll wear i mean. it should be really fun. It's 937, and i haven't done my homework yet. i'm too lazy... not good. oh well, it doesn't matter, because tommorow is FRIDAY. friday friday friday, that beautiful word, that means the end of the week. the last day of the week. NO SCHOOL THE DAY AFTER. that is why fridays are so glorious. I'd better go. i'm sure i should be doing more productive things.

       School was OK. I cut my knee on my desk during english, and it bled all over the place. the teacher asked if i wanted to go to the nurse. uhh, hello! it's just a flesh wound! and... i had math first period, which lasted FOREVER, and we didn't do much there. then there was english, and then lunch, and then PE, and then science. then i went to advisory for thirty minutes and left at 345. and that is my school day. at home i lazied off, felt bad for mellie because she cleaned my room, and it looked SO BAD, and then i did my homework at seven. not much more i can do, because i printer is out of coloured ink, and we have none left in the house. and because i have no one to talk to, i'm just blabbering on about nothingness.. anyway, i'll let it go, and find something else to do.

       this weekend was a lot of fun. on friday i did that stupid french fashion show, and we all made a complete fool of ourselves.  In the car i just can't wait/ To pick you up on our very first date/ Is it cool if i hold your hand?/ Is it wrong if i think its lame to dance?  After school ended, i went home, took a "chower" got my partay outfit on, straigtened my hair, and left fashionably late. i got there just in time for when the music started. very classy music, like baby got back, tootsie roll, dirrty, and the electric slide. then of course there was the slow dancing, and that gay man that always takes the pictures for buttons. of course i got some classic ones, of me and antoinette pretending we were high on caffinated bevrages. it was really funny. then we did the cottonaye joe (spelling?) so i danced with "katies man" and other random boys i didn't know in the slightest bit. in the end nathan barnett asked me to slow dance, and that was great fun... mostly cause i put my hands around his neck, and he put his hands on my waist, and guys usually don't dance that correct way. and then i went home and found out that i got a CELL PHONE which was also the greatest surprise of the night. and the next day, we went to see santa clause 2, which was OK, i thought it was really funny in some areas. Later on that night, i went to eat with antoinette and caroline, and that was a LOT of fun. we ate at mi cocina, and called william (antoinettes man) and bugged him till no rest. and then we called eachother on our cell phones, and caroline pretended like she had one, even though she was just borrowing her fathers. and then i went to anto's house and we did handstands on her bed, and attempted to to handstands on the wall, but we were too scared. and we tried to do cartwheels onto the bed, but that didn't work out too well. my stomach still hurts... call my cell: 214.629.6748 it vibrates! - You know, who ever invented homework, should DIE! well, i'm sure that their already dead, but if they were still alive, they SHOULD DIE. - you'll remember memories forever! unless you get alzchimers, but that's a different story -me at mi cocina's - I'd better go. not that i have anything to do, i just can't think of anything more to say. oh well! a biento! - Juliette

       Well. it has been a long week. i've had a lot of projects, problems to deal through, etc. and i have a party to attend tommorow, plus a french fashion show. and i still have to do my homework. i'll do it tommorow morning.  when i ripped my pants i thought that i had everbody on my side but i went and blew it all sky high and now she won't even spare a passing glance all just because i ripped my pants when big larry came round just to put him down sponge bob turned into a clown and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and ripped his pants i know i shouldn't mop around i shouldn't curse because the pain feels so much worse cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun or sand in your buns now i learned a lesson i won't soon forget so listen and you won't regret be true to yourself don't miss your chance and you won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants  I love sponge bob square pants.  well. i gotsta go, sleep is needed.

       it's been a while since i've posted, mm? yes, well, i had to perform our play all weekend this weekend, my password was changed on AOL because someone hacked into it, and my braces got tightened today. ouch. but i've decided that there is most likely too much emotion bottled up in me, so this will most likely be long. unless my dad comes in and kicks me off or something. - Your bothering me. decide wether your want to be our friends or not, but don't hopscotch around. if i'm annoying to you, tell me. i'm your best friend. so stop - get off it. stop being mean to me, and all high and mighty. i know your cool, but you'll lose your coolness if you don't stop. ive had enough of you using me. if you want to be my friend, cool. if not, tell me, and for freaks sake i'll leave you and your bloody self alone. so stop - what will i do when your gone forever? its hard enough right now, without you here. come home soon, cause i have no one logical to talk to. they're all either gay or a bear. besides, you were always nice to me. so don't stop, just come back - i want life to resume as normal, but it won't because everyone has found their ways, except for me. i'm the only family member left, who's just out there. sometimes its cool. sometimes its not. -  try to hold on  - i'm sick of everyone obsessing about clothes. their just clothes. its stupid. - my teeth hurt. - i have to go. there's too much to do. - Julia

       alrighty then... my sister has been doing all of this research paper stuff, and their like, 40 pages long, and i am having trouble writing two page ones, double spaced, 12 pt. font. and i don't even get good grades on them! i think i need to go to an essay school or something... anyway. christmas break comes up, and i am super excited, because that means no more rushing to get things done! teachers always do this! they know they only have a certain amount of time before break, so theres this time crunch, and they pack in as many tests, etc. as they can. darn them. and lets see.. my mom is taking forever to scheduale a hair cut appointement, saying that i don't need one.but i mean, i want my hair to grow faster, and your supposed to cut your hair every 6 weeks, and i haven't gotten it cut since this summer, so i really need one... anyway, i'd better go, hope all is going well everywhere Jules

       Well, its school time, not the funnest time in the week. and i have fifteen minutes to leave, theres nothing to do, and i finally got a computer, only to find out that i don't know , what to do on it. I mean, my friends are all in computer, and i amd here doing absolutely nothing, and i won't until 1245 because thats when they get out. have i already said this? i can't remember. i'm too tired. there is so much work to do, and i don't think that there is humanly enough time to have fun AND do all my work. i guess that means that i actually have to try hard now, to get good grades, finally. I'm sick of getting lousy grades, and i'm sick of forgetting to take my medicine so i can't concentrate in class. i don't know, i guess my life is just full of laziness. i have all this time sometimes, and i never use it, and then when i get all these hard things to do, i have such a busy scheduale, and i wish that i had done my work when i had the chance. oh well, i guess i'd better get going. there is only ten minutes left, so i'm sure i can think of something to do before i work, right? Ok, so maybe i'll stay on and right, for those really really really few viewers who read this. i don't know if i should get my hair cut today, or with my friend on saturday. if i did get my hair cut with my friend, i would need money for that AND shopping for a top, but i already have 20 dollars, so that can't be too much. and if when i DO get my hair cut, should i just trim it, or should i get layers? and if i get layers, should i get normal layers, movie star layers, or sexylayers? hmm? there are just too many options. and if i did get to go to my friends house on Friday to saturday, should i stay up really late playing sims, or should i get my beauty sleep? sims! anyway... maybe i should type slower, because i've typed all of this and i still have 6 minutes to waste! darn it! oh well. maybe i'll just go visit with jessica and sandra.

       The other night i tried to post, but my aunt barbra came in and used the computer and deleted it. oh well. yesterday night my aunt took me to the mall, and i went around to all of the makeup stands and i asked for free samples, and i've gained like, a billion dollars worth of free make up, and it is 328, and i am studying with anto and caro at 345 for the math test that i'm going to fail, and katie and i are sort of in a fight but sort of not, because she threw carrrots at me and splattered water all over my face and stuff, and she thought that was funny, and i think there is something sick with finding humour out of splashing people with dirty olive-carrot-bread infested water. that was spilled all over my tray.oh well, it doesn't matter. i'm listening to lose yourself by my husband, so everything is OK. my baby! alright, i've got to go, Jules

MATH HOMEWORK. darn it. i don't think i can handle it! the next break is on the 20th. THE 20TH. that only gives us 5 days until christmas. 5 DAYS. so i will have to go through... 15 days of school and work, not counting weekends, before i get a break. ok, maybe 14, because the last day is just goofing off. anyway, i'd better go. its late, and i cant think, and i'm tired, and i have to wake up early.

       Man my sister can be a JERK. something or someone caused her to have a bad day, so she screams at everyone. the little kids were acting up in the car, i'll admit, but she screamed her head off because they wouldn't listen to her. and i just stared at her out of awe. she just started telling me to stop looking at her, that i was driving her crazy too. and then i said something pseudo mean, i forgot quite what, and she punched my arm. so i punched her back, and she punched me again. and then said, "well why don't you cry about it baby." so i punched her again and then just broke down telling her how mad i am at her for saying that she would be nicer and then come back and be mean again, and how she's not saying the best vocabulary, and how i just wanted it all to stop. and when we got home, she went inside, got something, and then left. but before i would let her leave i asked her where she was going. she said no where. i asked her again. none of your business. i asked her again. why would you care. i asked her again. i'm just going for a drive. she thinks i don't care. sure, i am mad at her, and she's probably furious at me for something or other, but that doesn't mean i don't care about her. i don't want her to go and kill herself or something. anyway, i know this is probably stupid to everyone else out there who reads this sad little site, but oh well. i really needed the venting.

       I don't have school today either. now isn't that cool? so yesterday i didn't do anything but clean my room and start to clean out my bathroom. i still haven't finished, this is hard work man. oh yeah, and my mom took me and the little kids and margaret to mcdonalds, and i swear like no one was driving, it was way empty. so we parked horizontily in a vertical parking lot, and sat around and talked and ate for like one hour. and then i went back to my cleaning ness. and today i woke up at 900ish because my brother wanted me to win mario. so i play that for a little bit, the missionaries come over, i decide to clean a little more, not much success, and then i started on my homework. and i know i'm probably going to have to go to school tomorrow darn it, because the ice is melting and that makes me so sad. that means i have a french test, history quiz, and math quiz coming up that i have to study for. ah well, i'd best be off!

       Lately, i've had the strange and sudden urge to be really really american. like, living the lifestyle in a tommy hilfiger or american eagle ad. i mean, the jeans, the white flowy shirt, the lip gloss, the adorable blonde guy, bare feet, probably based in california, even texas. in the desert or something. but the sun has to be setting. thats what i feel like doing lately. is that not odd? i suppose. does anyone else go through this stage? so now i'm downloading all these "american girl" songs, weezer, tom petty. all that good stuff. and oldies too. i also wish i could live in the 60's, where things were more innocent and everything wasn't surrounded by terrible media and advertising and sick lyrics. like, the other night in the car, "barbra ann" by the beach boys played, and i knew all the lyrics, when the song was over i flipped through the stations and i heard "baby turn around and let me see that sexy body go bump bump bump." it totally made me feel terrible that i actually liked that song, and new the lyrics after listening to such a cute and innocent song by the beach boys. hm. ah well. other than that i really like life. i like myself more compared to when i was really putting myself down. i've learned to like my hyper and bubbly personality. its pretty cool.not everyone can know all the lyrics to "blow ya mind", listen to shania twain, "man i feel like a woman", listen to weezer, and the beach boys and love them all equally. and i'm not afraid to dance in the car or anywhere. i think its kind of funny. but maybe i think its funny because its 140 in the morning. but anyway, the point is, is that i like my lifestyle, and i wish that everyone could live it one day. they would totally have a blast. not every day is perfect, but who's is? hee hee! i'd better go. i've got to go dance to some music, and right now i'm listening to "your still the one" so i really wish i had a boyfriend. darn it! 2 more years! actually, 1 and 2 months. hee hee! love ya babe Jules

       i slept 3 hours last night. darn it. i can't seem to fall asleep at all the past 2 days. ugh.. my head, its pounding. this man in my house, he just won't die. he won't leave! you know, after a certain period of time, you OVERSTAY a visit. i think that visit was over stayed in december. and then he left january. and then he CAME BACK. he just won't DIE. ah well. i am in debate right now. i'm supposed to be researching for teen curfew (pro) but you know, i'm just not in the mood. antoinette has been sick for a while, and i feel sorry for her. she should be coming back tommorrow. i hope. katie is mad at me because she thinks that i am jealous of her or something. i don't really know. whatever she thinks, i doubt its what is actually wrong with me. i am very tired, and i took my adderal today. so, i don't talk much when i take it. last night i told my mom that smith was an a-hole, i mean, i actually said "a-hole" and not the substitute. i don't know why i said that. i'm very upset with myself, because i had no reason to be so crude, and the whole thing was just stupid and my mom and dad got mad at me for saying that, which i think is rediculous, because even though i never say that and i think its crude, i know margaret says it a lot, but she never gets yelled at. and she seems to be upset lately, and her mood swings are very stressful, so i never know how to walk in the car, because she might be happy and she might be evil. and its just not cool. and i am now very worn out and should probably leave before the debate teacher comes in asking us how we're doing.

"oh my. tostado's are so cool. woo woo! watch out, they might poke your eyes out if you throw them around peoples faces." geez. man, who has seen the show on MTV called "punk'D" ashton kutcher is the host and he's wicked cute, and i love what he does. he tells people via microphones in the ear and tells them to go up to celebrities and play pranks on them. what a great show. well i'd better go. nothing good to do, but i'm pretty tired of typing, and i've got to go check show times for clone high and punk'D and other great shows.

       I'm really sad. I'm going to san diego on saturday, and i'm excited about that and all, but i had my hopes up once again for the idea that i would get to take my dad's camera. i mean, its one of those oldish ones, where you have to wind up after you take the picture, and my sister already has a camera of her own. one like it, only for modern. so she doesn't like that one apparently any more, and we've only got one short lense. she's of course taking my dad's camera. i don't know, i've been interested in photography for a while, i just never talk to anyone about it. i really like those black and whites, their dramatic like my personality, but i like color too, because its so bright and happy like me. i wanted to actually take some good photos of san diego, and i'll instead get crummy disposable camera ones. this makes me so sad.

       this saturday i am going with my best friend to san fransisco. i mean, how cool is that. i still have so much junk to get though, and i don't know if i'll have enough money, and i am supposed to bring my dads camera but seeing as my sister hates me, it probably won't happen. we're staying at the del, and it should be really fun. i might even swim with the dolphins, we'll see, and that would be fun! i don't have much more news other then that, so i'll leave now, but everyone email me or write me or something. i haven't receieved real mail for like 2 months.

       you know, its totally decided that middle school sucks. i mean, everyone has told me this. there are a few good memories, but most of my good and happy memories are swamped with bad ones. really really bad ones. everyone thinks there life sucks. everyone thinks everyone else's life is better. so everyone tries to do whatever they can to try and make it to the top, or be like that other "perfect person." or to make their life seem picture perfect. everyone thinks that i'm a really open person. i am open: about stupid things. 50% of my life, past, and pretty much of things that have happened this year, are hidden in only my head. things that only my family and close family friends know what i'm talking about. none of my school friends or even church friends, come to think of it, no one could understand the pain and chaos that this year has been. i've never cried this much in my life, and i've never had to deal with such mean people. i mean, my friends are nice, they really are. on a good day, we get along nicely. we all exchange laughs, then we all decide to gang up on one person and leave them out. at the time, its exciting, "i'm with them! i'm with the group! i feel so important and popular! i love this day!" i love it, in the beginning. then, we leave for class, or even home, and then it sinks in: i am so mean.why did i just do that? is that person going to commit suicide or something today just because of what we did? i wonder if she's like at home and crying on her pillow. and then when they do that same thing to me. i sit on my bed and cry and think, "i wonder if they know what they did. do they care? i wonder if their talking about me right now? who am i supposed to talk to?" and then i try and vouch not to do it again, but other people don't believe me, and still bring up the fact that i exclude people in the past. and i'm sure i do it now. but i think i'm mad at myself about it. and then what about those situations when its somebody's word against somebody's word? who are you supposed to trust? i'm sick of writing. i sound stupid and mellodramatic, and like a drama queen. i'll write later Jules

       i'm at school and i feel guilty because i called my mom and asked if i could go over to antoinettes house, and she said she really needed me to babysit, and then when i called back later to ask why can't margaret, she said because margaret is coming, and she said forget it, she'll be at her house at 730. and she said it all sweet and stuff, and was really nice about it and now i feel really bad.

       tonight was fun too. i have a feeling that after break this year, i'm going to come back to school different. i mean, maybe physically, but mostly the way i act. this should be interesting, and we'll see. anyway, today we ate at joes and watched mary kate and ashely's winning london, and then more 24, which was awesome. i've had so much fun lately, and i love it! i find things to do, other then watch tv and veg out. its way cool. better go, i'm hanging out with my little bro and sis.

       tonight was fun. even though i didn't go with my friends to get a manicure and pedicure. i kind of got offended because they were supposed to come watch the first season of 24 with me, and i got locked out of my house, and like right when i got it, i found out that they had planned a whole dinner afterwards thing, and totally left me out, however they did invite me, but i didn't feel like going. i wasn't in the mood to have someone wait on me. so, i came home today and waited for ashley to come home, and then we ate some ben and jerries "chocolate with brownie mix" new ice cream, and we looked at bridal magazines and rings, and then i watched 24, by myself, cause ashley kind of left. it was lonely, but fun i guess.

       my last week of school is this week. so many things to do, and so little time, and too much exaughstian. (spelling?) my friend at school is now set on some africans are so sad and america must help them thing. and i really don't get it, because america really has too much on their hands right now, they're not being selfish. i mean, our educators, teachers, doctors, and money is out there, however their goverernment is corrupt and uses it the wrong way. but is that our fault? i didn't think so, and besides, don't we have the safety of the american people to worry about first? SARS, the war, deaths, murders, kidnappings, yada yada yada. i think people should research what they're talking about before they decide they know everything about it after watching some episode on the discovery channel about how a kid drownds every something or other time, and how innocent people are being suide and why isn't america helping again? oh  yeah ! i almost forgot!  we're at war now, and aren't selfish, its the presidents job to look out for america and the safety of those who live there  and president clinton was a good president? how about 1) trashing the white house after he left (how stupid is that? and childish...) 2) raping women, more then one 3) having an affair in the oval office 4) getting us in trouble with north korea (isn't the payback coming now??) 5) not doing anything about osama bin laden when he had the chance to put him in jail and everyone KNEW he was a bad man, and he let him go 6) bad mouthing america when he was out of the country... i mean how great is that president? sigh... exams and sleep now

       i just found out that not only are we leaving for provo then going to the family reunion, but we will also be going to provo again for one month, but my dad won't be coming. isn't that sad? i love my dad, he's way cool. and i hate thinking about him alone at home. i think i'll go to EFY when i'm there, i'm not sure. mary having respect for me really makes me happy. cause its hard to gain her respect, and i've been  trying  to tell the family i don't dress that tarty, but no one will listen! today was a very good sunday. my dad gave a very good talk, and for some reason i got along with everyone-- everyone in the halls were smiling and waving at me and giving me hugs, i love my  ward, because its so friendly. margaret is taking me to the new paul frank store tomorrow, and i'm super excited, except i'm broke :( so i'm hoping mom and dad will lone me money... :|    anyway!i have a ton to do this summer. i want to go to swiss simester, but i have to work out in order to do that, so i have to lose like twenty or more pounds and stuff, and bike ride and jog and all that. and i have so much summer reading and the new harry potter book comes out JUNE 21st and i'm way excited! definatly! i wonder how my friends are doing-- i haven't heard from them all summer! i can't help but wonder if they'll all be my friends, because i still like them a lot and all, but what if we change abruptly and butt heads? hmm. but i think this summer will be a very good experience, i think that i will do a lot of growing and stuff because margaret is leaving and all that.  anyway, its late and i'm tired, so i'll write back later

       margaret leaves for college soon and it makes me very sad. because, although it never seemed like we liked eachother, but we have this bonding thing that no one else sees or is a part of.It's like, she's not like everyone else, you know? and it will be really hard to stay here and be the oldest one in the family. i don't care about the priviledges i will get or what it will be like to sit in the front seat of the car, or what it will be like to drive or whatever. playing john lennon's "imagine" while writing this probably wasn't a good idea-- it's gonna be mushy. i don't really want to grow up. people will die and it will be hard, and life won't be fun anymore. people will depend on you a ton, and you don't have the same care-free time. it sucks. and i mean, what if she gets in trouble at college or whatever, or what happens when i need help, and there is no one to turn to. i mean, i love my parents, but they don't see everything from my point of view like my older sisters do. i thought i could handle this cause i'm older then i was with mary, but it'll be just as hard. especially because she's leaving early in the summer instead of later in the summer like mary did.   WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD Louis Armstrong  I see trees of green, red roses too I see them bloom for me and you And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  I see skies of blue and clouds of white The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky Are also on the faces of people going by I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do They're really saying I love you.  I hear babies crying, I watch them grow They'll learn much more than I'll never know And I think to myself what a wonderful world Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.   what a happy song. if i could live in a song, i would live in that one. i think the john lennon song is so sad to me, not because of the lyrics but because margaret loves the beatles so much. and it brings back like a silent video of memories with that song playing, and i know this sounds way cheesy, but it's what's going on in my head right now. so bear with me. i think this summer will be a mucho mais bueno growing experience. zeut allors. je ne comprend pas ma vie. allors, je veux dormir parce que je suis tres fatiguee. bon nuit.  what a wonderful world

       something weird is chirping long and in shrills in our fire place, and i have no idea what it is.... today we came back to dallas, and it is worse than i expected. it's hot, and humid, its flat, and ugly, and not everyone is nice like in utah. we went to go see pirates of the caribbean with the whole fam and barbara. it was really good and it made me want to be a pirate. i had planned on visiting with, and saying goodbye to patterson, aka jamal, a really good friend of mine who will be leaving to go to east texas until december, and then is moving back to north carolina. but my mom decided that she didn't want to take two cars... ? so she made me stay home and babysit again...? why does she do this to me when i watched her kids for her in provo all the time? and i worked   really  reallly really   hard to watch the kids? maybe she hates me or something... oh well i miss margaret a lot, and i'm having a lot of trouble not having any peers to look up to. i'm very lonely and wish i had some pirate with a sexy goatee to comfort me, but i've got no one. NO ONE! i hope katie gets home soon, because i want to do stuff, and i HAVE to go visit antoinette. life is killing me smalls.

       So anyway, just ignore that developed post, i was just surprised. anyway, today is our last day to meet people, so we just had dinner with some of the old missionaries in our area. it was interesting. one was making me rather uncomfortable, but the other two were still hilarious. one was really shy when he first started, and met us riding his sister's mint green scooter. he's grown his hair long and now has this shaggy hair-do going on. the other one had glasses and high lights and he was laughing all over the place and giving lots of hugs. it was good all in all. but now i'm with the kids in the apartment with mehissa next door talking REALLY loudly on the phone and i'm babysitting which totally sucks. i pushed all day to go to the BYU bookstore so i could get this shirt i wanted, and then my mom didn't let me buy it when we finally went. that kind of upset me because i was going to watch the kids tonight and i watched them this morning and cleaned out a ton of heavy stuff from the car, and she didn't even let me get a shirt! oh well, i guess she has reasons or something. anyway i'd better get back. but to all my friends-- call me please! i'm coming home on wed. at 1:30 so we have to talk or hook up or something cause i'm gonna die from boredom!! bye and see you soon, Jules

       Isn't it ironic that my post is about my sister and my mom leaving today?? It makes me quite depressed. i wish i could go back in time waiting for them to return together. Margaret is gone, and now mary is gone. and my mom too. soon i'm going somewhere out in texas, where i don't know, and i'm leaving for about a week. I'm worried what will happen to jordan and zack, like, will they be incredibly insecure with everyone around them leaving? I'm also freaked because i'll be left home with my dad and maureen, and the two kids, and with all those people, i'm bound to have no privacy, or sanity, in my life. I can already tell that i'm going to go crazy with maureen around me all the time, and i'll have no big sister to whine to, or complain to, and i won't have someone like my mom to drive me away, or get me that coke i needed, and i won't have that sister around who will take me to mcdonalds one morning, just because she wanted to suprise me. i mean, i am totally depressed about all this. i have a toga party tonight but i don't know if i can have fun there, just because i miss everyone so much. i don't think that i'll have THAT great of a time. we're going to see spy kids 3-D again today, and i hope that can divert my mind from any thought of family. i have to take a shower, and i have to clean my room, and i have to do my homework, but mary isn't here any more! and it makes me soo soo soo sad. and my mom isn't here, and margarets not here, and i feel so lost and alone.... darn this. i don't know if i like being the oldest. julia

       Well shizzle. I'm babysitting th kids again. i had community service today for seven hours helping mentally ill at a carnival. i have homework to do. i'm dead tired. and i really want to smell axe body spray (essence by the way, not that tsunami one they have.) yesterday my adorable mother took me to go see secondhand lions, which was suprisingly a very good movie. i really did enoy it-- i recommend everyone seeing it. its one of those laugh-one-second-then-cry-the-next kind of movies so it=good. bueno. church tomorrow. what i'll wear? never any idea. i have no clothes, and no winter shoes. i know. i have a sad little wardrobe upstairs. MTV so needs to come to my room and re-furbish it. anyway, i'd better go my eyes are hurting from staring at the computer screen for too long.   jules

       man, it was late, and i don't know what came over me, but i apologize for the really super lame posts with all the quiz results on them.. that was gay. the red sox lost! i'm so sad and disappointed! darn yankees, they always beat everyone else... why can't they let the poor man get a break? jerks... I'm off of school today.. so i'm tired and bored. kind of. i'm not really bored, but i am tired for sure. i might babysit for the scholls tonight, but if i don't i really hope i can go to spirit night with anto because apparantly someone is bringing her boyfriend alongwho we don't really think exists, and even if he does, we don't believe she's done the things she's said she's done... yeah. so if i went, i would have fun dancing with anto and stuff, and i could meet carolines date to homecoming which i'm not going to by the way because my mom won't let me date, which is really crazy, the not letting me go thing, because i'm just going to a dance with someone and dancing the slow songs with them, so i don't understand why my mom won't let me go dance with someone i do that at every party, and if i did get to go to spirit night tonight, then i could also meet andrew, antos stalker, again, and he's so interesting to look at cause he's wierd, and if i did go to spirit night, this would be the first time i've been out of the house for like 5 weekends. phew! RUN ON OR WHAT?! My mom cleaned my room for me, which was kind of sad in a way that i'm too irresponsible to clean my own filth. i feel even worse because my room is kind of getting messy again, so i feel terrible-er.  Mary's little post about bill is kind of gross... it reminds me of a story i'm writing right now for english for a story we're reading right now called don't lets go to the dogs tonight. i like it a lot actually, it is a very interesting book. it has a part in it about the author, and how she'd been praying for a little sister for so long, and she finally got a little sister, and her mom told her to watch over her, and this two year old baby wandered away and drowned in the lake, and her sister, the author, talks about what she looks like and its way depressing. so i wrote a narrativeish story to fill in the missing gap of what olivia, the girl who died, did and the process she went through to die... does that make sense? any requests asked, and i'll post it if you really really really want to read it... i'd better go, i've got an important business meeting to attend...

         Hee!  You are Jack's "You have to find yourself a girl, mate ... you're not a eunuch, are you?" speech.  You're quite a bit sex- crazed, and you assume that everyone else is as horny as you are.  Get it on as soon as possible so that you can join the rest of us on Planet Earth ... I'm sure you'll have a good time doing so.    my gosh it wasn't the one i really got, but i thought this one was really really funny..

         You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       note to self: never go driving with mom when you've only been driving a few times... that was by far the scariest thing i've ever been through, the more uptight she got the worse i did because she totally freaked out. it was just bad news. anyway. i have a lot of work. darnded school started again. my room is totally terrible, there are baskets of clothes and junk piled on top of eachother, no clean clothes, i can't find anything. and i have no time to clean it. darn. anyway i'd better go. darn school.

       people are not coming now because i do not update enough! i feel shameful! well, thanksgiving was very humorous. i guess. it was very relaxed and mellow, and rather enjoyable (many blackmail shots) until maureen called... HANSEN EMERGENCEY! it was like, chloe ran away or something, and everyone was crying, and there was a lot of screaming. i finished watching french kiss with my sister and my dad, great movie. last night, mary's friends came over shhhh just to see me, and we had a good time of playing trivial persuit ( i tied with bonnie! exciting!) then we watched the justin timberlake SNL, "bring it on down to omlettville" and we dressed up. earlier yesterday afternoon, we went to urban outfitters, but i didn't get anything. my mom got me a very lovely black skirt which wasn't cheap, and the exact shoes i was looking for. it was a great day. my dad left and i miss him, he's at a confrence. i have a lot to do coming up, but i will update i promise. fans, come back! PLEASE!

       My parents kind of let me go over to antoinettes house today, rock on, kind of meaning my mom apparently didn't technically tell me i could go.... oh well, i had a good time. anto and i stayed after school and helped all the cute debate boys come in asking for our help desperatly, like this one guy who came up to antoinette and was all, "hey do you know where i can go have a smoke?" and she was all "ummm yeah, outside." so this guy and his friends walk out in front of the glass doors and just start puffing their lives away, my gosh. anyway, we helped the rest of the guys and girls get to their rooms, and then we hung around the school for a bit, read the remarker, and then antoinettes mom came and picked us up. we hung out in her room for a while, while i gradually took over her incredibly cozy bed, until we decided to order pizza and coke and watch x-men. and indeed it was as great as i had hoped for. the away message i came up with for her computer that night: Auto response from beeeep (sorry, i can't give you her screen name, you might stalk): *check, check* This is Julia on Antoinettes computer and personally i have to say that we are having a blast. i mean, we are having a party over hurrrr. the cheese is flowing (over the pizza....) and the movies are playing, and i'm dancing like britney, and personally i am happy that your not around, because I don't like hanging around ugly people because personally that just scares me and scars me. and scccaaaaares me. so coooodainaate. cause i have a date. so don't be late. 208-3151 (that's code for all you lamo's out there.... darn lamo's........) xoxo, Jules (and anto.... who laughed for a little while, and said to put "hurrrr') p.s. i love you  and indeed it was that long. the beauty of it all. mom and dad and the kids came to pick me up at about nineish, and we drove home. both of them are so stressed out with all these money problems, it's totally tearing everyone apart, and stressing people out, especially me. mom is a nervous wreck all the time and always yelling, and for some odd reason my dad is very tranquille. tranquil. whatev. anyway, i've got to go back to download music. but call me! mary that includes you! margaret too!

       i don't think i have told anyone, but i have a live journal now. i'm not sure if i want to tell people about it though. maybe i should keep this one secret? hmm... i don't know. tomorrow i'm sleeping over at antoinette's house, and i think i get to drive there which should be really fun. but that is a very slight maybe, probably not. my dad may be too tired. i still have to pack for the whole thing though. today was pretty fun. My life has become consumed with neopets, that really stupid game i used to play in the fifth grade. there is something about it... maybe i feel more independent handling my own "money" and getting "money" from playing "games", i mean games. i don't know. i've been very lazy lately, not very happy about that. my room = inhabitable. i sleep there, and wash my face and brush my teeth and get dressed. and i never go in for the rest of the day. i have to read a book for history class still, and i have to finish writing in my yoga journal.  we watched the emperors club today, and again, it made me all teary eyed. it really is a good movie. iiiii have to go. i have that whole packing thing... oh wait, no school tomorrow... i don't have to pack until tomorrow! HA HA! well i have to go do not neopets. Julia

       Sunday, December 28, 2003 :::    I believe it was on Christmas eve's eve when I was returning from dropping off my little sister at her friends house for a sleep over. On the way back I was driving along Theiss Mail in front of doerre and spotted an animal in the middle of my lane. With my lightning quick reflexes I slammed on the brakes and maneuvered the car out of the path of the animal while not going into the ditch. My tires slid well past the where the little guy should have been but I didn't feel or hear a thump. I opened my door and looked back on the pavement and saw a big raccoon writhing on its back in a small spatter of blood. I assumed I'd made contact with the unlucky bastard and he must be in pain so I pulled into a driveway and assessed the situation. I figured I could run over it again at speed and try and kill it but I'd have to hit his head. I also had the .22 and some rounds in the trunk so I thought I could just shoot it. I called my dad and he frowned upon the gun idea, since there was a steady stream of traffic. He advised me to just leave it there to die in the street. By now Ricky Raccoon had gotten to his feet but wasn't moving out of the street. It appeared the only part or parts of him I hit were his leg/legs. Reluctantly I drove home leaving Ricky there for dead. I felt bad about hitting him but he probably had a better chance of survival with me than with anyone else. I wasn't speeding and was paying attention so I had about the quickest reaction possible. Wasn't enough for little Ricky though. May my poor, fuzzy, mutilated little friend rest in piece.  Here's to you Ricky. WE"LL NEVER FORGET YOU!!!  Hope it wasnt a mama raccoon. Who'll take care of the babies?     PICTURE OF RACOONS    www.sexmix.blogspot.com   i stubbled across this when logging in. i thought it was the funniest thing i'd ever seen, and by some random guy too!

       i did go to the mixer, yipee hooray! it was really fun. last weekend i went over to annies house, and we went to HOUSTONS and hung out around her house, and she gave me a tour, very private and exclusive, and then courtney came over, and we rented some movies, and then we watched lord of the rings, and caroline came over, then antoinette, so we all hung out, then courtney left for a while, so we played clue forever, then we ordered pizza, then courtney came back, then we watched degrassi and radio free roscoe, and then we played more clue, and then we watched lord of the rings, and then my dad called and said i couldn't go to the movie the next day which we had been planning forever, so i was really depressed, and then we stayed up and talked, then courtney left early and i left at noon. it was pretty fun. it's christmas eve! how exciting! i'll feel so lonely when christmas is over, its like, what will be left to do? nothing to look forward to but school... gross. we bought a ping pong table today, with what money i don't know. tonight the whole family will be watching a christmas story, my dad is coming home from work early, we're eating fireman sandwiches, baking sugar cookies, decorating the cookies, opening one gift, watching more movies, reading, "the night before christmas," and probably some scripture passages, roasting marshmallows over the fire, and then going to bed! well, that's at least what i'm pretty sure we'll be doing... i'll blog tomorrow. jules

       i hate school, for the record. this is my last full week, then next week ends friday. i just found out that i'm not sure if i can go to the mixer or not because my mom and dad are hosting this major importante dinner thing and i don't know if i have to babysit or stick around or what. anyway, i'm having a lot of fun, even though school sucks. annie and courtney are amusing me a lot, and antoinette and caroline are being there same cool selves. thank goodness. there have rarely been fights between all of us, and its really refreshing. well, school work is calling, so i'd better go!

       I was reading one of my old friends' old blog, which she doesn't write in any more. I think she is way depressed because it seems like she is so lost and doesn't know where to go. i don't know how i can help, i mean, i try not to be mean to her, and i feel like i shouldn't judge her, but i feel like when we were friends she finally was the head honcho, so she took over and picked on everyone else because she finally felt powerful. i mean, she was finally important, but she said such mean things and demanded so much of me. i don't know, i feel bad about it.  anyway this afternoon my mom and i went to go see honey, and it turned out to be really good actually. i liked it a lot, especially jessica alba, she was so cute, and i didn't know she was such a good dancer! hm, you learn something new everyday. anyway, i still have a lot in my room to clean. better get to that julia

It's december, and i've only got like... 2 and 1/2 weeks until school gets out for break. i can't describe my excitment. excitement. hm. i have church stuff tonight, for like an hour and a half, which cuts into my "the simple life" portion of the night. i also have a lot of homework, because all the classes i had today and yesterday, will be together tomorrow for mom's day. so i kind of have a lot of work to do. i have to write a poem, and i'm having the hardest time doing it, i don't know why. i have some french stuff to do and memorize. dad is gone. mom has started stressing out again. AGAIN, the kids have been so bad again. i can't figure it out. when i'm not there nontheless! they are so so so terrible. i can't take it. my room is sooo soo messy. my brain hurts. my teeth hurt (orthodontist yesterday!) and i'm procrastinating a lot. a lot a lot. i've got and hour and a half to work. then i have to go. so i'd better get to it.

       OK, today was a good day, i feel. except, i ran a light or something, i'm not quite sure, and almost hit a bunch of cars, but thats ok! anyway, today was busy. i'm going to be very busy in february, so if i don't post a lot, deepest apologies. everything will be really busy, actually, until spring break. so, until then you're going to have to deal with these lame 1 paragraph blog entries. then i can post a real womans blog. but not today. anyway, training, i got some work done. i got an ice cream cone tonight, it was good (chocolate) and i read some stuff, and did some more stuff, and went to school, and made a good bowl. my grades were actually pretty good this quarter, no C's, no B-'s. English though. thats a killer. and so was physics. we'll see. i got an A- in history! and an almost B+ in french (it was bad this quarter.) A+ in yoga and A in ceramics. i'd better go. school and stuff.

       YESterday was winter formal, and it was very entertaining. my PARENTS wouldn't let me bring a date, and my mom didn't trust me if i bought a sleevless/strapless dress, if i would keep the sweater on. so, i looked ugly. especially with the braces. anyway. it was still fun. everyone looked very pretty, and most of their dates did too. some i will not mention.... we had fun dancing, but then some people (AKA everyone but antoinette and i) bagged out on us and went downstairs. and didn't tell us. so we searched and searched for hours. and then, finally they came back, and the DJ played stairway to heaven last. annie let neil (not neal) slow dance (kind of) with me, but it was more like, slow dance, then head bang, then we sway in coordination side to side, then we kind of slow dance again. it was interesting. and everyone around me (except alexia and antoinette and caroline i hope) were making out. oh, and i wasn't either. because its NEIL! weird! anyway, then we drove the bus back and discussed pick up lines, interesting conversation. i was supposed to drive home, however, to my loss, i left my permit in the car, so...  my dad drove me home. but we did stop at taco bell. ah ha. annnnd thats all i have to say. school starts again tomorrow. grrr.... only five more days till friday! then i have to clean my room, or else i can't go to coffee house! that would be totally tragic!!

       Yestereday wad Dad's day and oh what an adventure it was! Let us recap... - Dad got to experience the thrills and excitments of French, English, Ceramics, Math, and history! - For lunch we went to fogo de chao with mom to find out that margaret got accepted into the Rome programme, and also, has spent all her money! - We went to the dad's day dance (mom chewed me out for not wearing stockings.... hooray!) which was decked out in mardi gras dec, and no one was on the dance floor! - We got our characeture done, waited in line for an hour, and the lady sucked! - We did dance on the dance floor, which was fun actually - Went home to watch the beginning of conan obrien before i passed out in exaughstion.  today i woke up late! 1030! i was so excited to sleep in you have no idea. i love sleep. we went to go see confessions of a teenage drama queen. i can totally relate. but she had so much fake tanning junk on, it looked odd. i want her hair.   Spring is just around the corner, and although i'm in lvoe with winter, i do enjoy spring quite a bit. i like the sun, and the idea of school getting out. i like the beach, and the wind, and hot summer days in france... so yes i do like spring. only three months until school is out! woo hoo! i think i'm going to start counting down.  Tonight my parents go to dinner. i hope i can convince chealsea L to come over to watch movies with me. that would be really fun. oh she could sleep over if she really wanted! we'll see. i also hope we can make a taco bell run sometime soon. and i want to go to nordstrom's rack.  shake the money tree shake shake

       Now that that's over with, we can start getting dirty. First off, the Madonna collaboration. Utterly heinous. A friend of mine characterized "Me Against the Music" as sounding like "something out of a freaking video game," which, to me, sullies the name of video game music writers everywhere. (Then again, he also thought that when Britney whines, "I wanna get in the zoooone," she was actually saying, "I wanna get a P'Zoooone," the excellent Pizza Hut delicacy. So take his opinion for what it's worth.) Its too-slick, genetically-engineered-for-high-school-dances production does little to obscure the horrendous lyrics for which Britney actually earned a songwriter credit. B-Spurrs slings lyrical barbs like, "If you really wanna party/ send my love and get ya/ really to hit, you could die/ in a minute, I'mma take you on, I'mma take you on/ come on, yeah," and, "Take a drop and rock it!" .......... The hits just keep on coming with "Breathe on Me," another depresingly empty track that sees Britney take her whirlwind technique of aural whoring to a whole new level, and again without even a sniff of actual musical validity. The song starts off with twenty seconds of deep panting, with Spears breaking only to say, "It's so hot in here." (All this talk about the buckets of sweat the girl drips and how darn hot it is wherever she goes really makes you wonder about the kind of conditions under which she records. Does she cut vocal tracks in a freaking rainforest? Do the people at Jive think that inundating the record with sweat makes Britney sexier? None of this makes sense. Britney Spears is so stupid.)  ........ Britney's latest trainwreck was proposed as an album by an artist finding herself, getting in touch with her craft, and really showcasing everything that makes her unique and valuable. In the Zone accomplishes those goals completely; the only problem is, truly "finding" Britney Spears means realizing that there's nothing about her that's unique, valuable, or artistic. She's empty, personally bankrupt, and flat-out terrible. But if you needed a new album to tell you all that, then you obviously weren't listening at all in the first place.  GRADE: F-

       i don't know if adele even reads my website, but if she does, the song "e'erbody in the clubs gettin tips" is called tipsy by J-Kwon.  anyway, today was like friday for me becaussse i miss school tomorrow because i'm going on a road trip (with my mom, dad, mary, jordan, zack, and grandpa) to San Antonio. i'm hoping it will be fun. mary must bring her digital camera, and i will call for great shots to be taken... and they will be wonderful. let me think..... antoinette and i are so in unisine, its like we're sisters. we say stuff at the same time, in the same tone, at least three times a day. it's awesome.  fitness testing is tuesday and i really don't want to do it. mostly because it will just remind me of how fat and out of shape i am. but i don't want to dwell on it, because that's self pitying and that is stupid. Eminem and D-12's video about being the lead singer of the band is hilarious. and the ending, with the mexican salsa is even better. just another reason of why i love eminem soo much i'd better go. i have to pack, and i have to download music, and i have to take a shower, and i have to do stuff.... and work.. and stuff

       so anyway. still not mentioned in margarets blog. no worry, i will make it someday. that i am sure of. i watched much ado about nothing today. love that movie. "there's a double meaning behind that." ah, so great. keanu = hot. so anyway. i start spring break this week. i've already had a very good time. mom got me some pimpin coach shoes, in pink, nothing like that oats girl would wear. but still. they're hot. and i finally got to watch "pimp my ride," on MTV. quite possibly one of the greatest shows on the planet. Xzibit comes around to peoples houses and announces that they are going to get a pimped ride. they all have trashy cars and stuff. and they totally add all these sweet rims onto the car and everything. oh man. its awesome. zack, mom, and i went to see agent cody banks today. it wasn't as bad as i thought, but it did drag on much too long. zack thought it was pretty funny though, so it was worth seeing him break out in random shrieks of laughter. anyway, i'd better go to bed. jordan organized my desk last week. the note i got said, " Julia, I don't know what happened, i was playing outside and then my feet marched toward the house. then they carried me upstairs into your room and said, 'hands start working at the desk.' then my hands said, 'yes sir!' so they reached out toward your desk and started working. my eyes looked and watched in amazement as i created this masterpiece. i had gotten into a funky mood. Well, i hope your new desk is suitable. you can check the drawers and stuff but not everything is 'PERFECT.' the colored ready to be burnt CD's are under your desk on top of the CD burner. my list of songs is on the wall above the NEW spot where i put your tape and stapler which is located right of your computer and right in front of your blue stretchy/ flippy light. so you can enjoy your new desk now., Jordie. P.S-- good luck on your exams."  so cheerio then. until next time. book with travelocity. and don't forget your hat. the wondering gnome.

       I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles In our eyes are mirror images and when We kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate that God himself Did make us into corresponding shapes like Puzzle pieces from the clay True, it may seem like a stretch, but Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled Head when you're away when I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road for Several weeks of shows and when you scan The radio, I hope this song will guide you home  They won't see us waving from such great Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away, 'come down now,' but we'll stay...  I tried my best to leave this all on your Machine but the persistent beat it sounded Thin upon listening That frankly will not fly. you will hear The shrillest highs and lowest lows with   am i upsessed with this song? maybe. is it awesome? absolutely. should exams die? indefinately. i'm i writing too many questions? no.   anyway, this is like the third day IN A ROW that i've posted and personally i am rather proud. i mean, personally. anyway, i have to go do stuff. exam stuff.

       toothpastefordinner.com is like the greatest. i'm tired, and i should be going to take a shower now so i can get to bed at a decent hour. hum. oh well. i am tired, and i'm afraid i haven't studied much for exams. it will be much cramming this weekend. aye, i'm scared to death. activity at church tonight. pretty cool i guess. free cheesecake! anyway, school was OK. after school was not so much OK (so hungry... thanks antoinette!)  i was and am sad today because i realized how fat i am. and i was kind of grossed out. but i'm not gonna be like, "i've decided i need to change, i can't take it anymore." because every time i do that, it never happens. i'm too busy after school and during study halls to work out. i have no time in my life. i will have to rely in the summer to lose weight. maybe, but i'll probably be too lazy. i'm so lazy. argh. anyway. i'd better go. i thought i would update to make my sister happy. apparently no one checks anymore because "i never update." yeah right. whatever. that is sooo such a lie. "ouch!" "what is it annie?"  "i just got a sun burn... FROM YOUR HOTNESS!"  yeah i know. i know.

       annnywayy... so this months grades are definately not good, just because this year, third quarter is apparently my slump quarter. it used to be 2nd quarter, but whatever. i'll do much better 4th quarter, i can feel it. anyway, so we're definately going to France this summer. i'm actually very busy, unlike last year (booring). i have a driving time today and i don't want to go. especially because i don't want to run into that creeepy guy i ran into last time, and had to drive alone with. i seriously thought he was going to rape me and leave me to die. he makes me stop at 2 different gas stations, at one he wipes every window.. EVERY WINDOW. and at the second one, he fills up the gas tank...? anyway, this is my final one, and then i take my final test. i watched the prince and me with the family on saturday, and last week my mom surprised me and took me to pauls to get my hair cut, which is beautiful, and i went to a dance and realized that i really wanted a guy to hold hands with and who would think i'm the greatest, like in the prince and me. sigh. anyway, i have a lot of homework to do, and i'm creeped out because the yard men are cutting the lawn, but they keep staring in the windows at me and i'm really scared.... again.

       Ok, school is so over and i am bossed out. will someone PLEASE get me the harry and the potters CD because its radical. okkk well. my dad and i and zack went to go see  The Day after Tomorrow  and it was wicked sexy. i mean, i liked it and everything, but of course, hypothermia was involved; jake gylenhaal + that other chick = adorable. and i'm still so tired.  i'm also upset because my mom said that i could throw a party, and now i've invited all these people, but i don't think i can have it. which means that it is cancelled most likely, which makes me very sad. very very sad.  Girls Camp was actually really really fun. Like, i shirked all my duties, and i was totally a jerk to "my girls" but i went into town a bunch and hung out and went to mcdonalds and rebelled and broke rules. and i liked it. i became really good friends with these other girls from other wards, as well as many in our ward. well we became closer. i met these girls named Kristie (special K) and Sarah. and kristie called me mike jones cause she couldn't remember my name, which was fine by me. they were and still are, hillarious. we're totally hanging out all week. except like, when i'm at party's. or running in race for the cure. ah well. i've got some fan fiction to read. a novel to write. my journal to update and finish up. some sleep to get. some boys to dream of. some party's to plan and unplan. a summer to rock.

       so... today after school i went over to antoinettes house to film a spanish project for her, with annie and caitlyn. it was really fun actually. i had some lines, and i got to wear my aviators. i also got to talk in french in the end, for the credits. oh, and the really funny random part was when antoinette was like, "julia y draco" and then you saw me link arms with another person, but you couldn't see who, and then drink orange juice out of a wine glass. really fun. and theres that whole Hershay bebe bebe thing, but you really did have to be there. sorry, i know inside jokes are lame or whatever... but shut up.  school isn't over yet. two more days. but i still have a LOT of homework and a LOT of stuff to do. argh. argh argh. ARGH. after everyone left tony's house (that's ANTOINETTE for any LAMO'S who didn't know) we went to mi cocina (ayayay!)and saw some very cute hombres. and then.. we talked in different languages and people stared at us like we were insane, but it was fun all the same. and i'm very tired. and i just.. don't.. want to deal.. with sleep.. i mean school... anymore....

       Tom Felton  You know, today i checked my email, and guess what? tom felton answered my email. well, it's a long story, but in short, antoinette found his personal email, and so i emailed him. he actually answered, and said that we could write eachother (i asked if we could be penpals,in a manner of speaking.)   are you the one who is having a birthday soon? well, i've travelled a bit.  my fav location is australia's gold coast, the great barrier reef. i daresay youv'e heard of it?  well, it's spectacular.  i also toured a bit around canada, near ottowa.  that was pretty cool too.  i've been to LA, California.  I went to Dsineyland, which was really cool, bigger than EuroDisney, which is in europe.  my fave subject at school is drama, obviously, but apart from that, i don't mind maths.  my teacher is pretty good and i have lots of friends in that class.  ok, must dash,  tom  i mean, how cute is that? the whole penpal thing was in a different letter to antoinette, that's why it's not on here. anyway, i'm totally exctied. whatever. anyway, i have a lot a lot a lot of homework to do, but i'll try updating soon.

       anyway, so umm i'm sixteen now. i definately feel older this time. i don't know. i've been fighting with my parents a LOT lately (driving, my face, etc.) mostly about DRIVING. my mom is having a hard time letting go. anyway, it's just very frustrating for me since i've waited a long time. i'm also angry because my face has recently begun looking like a pizza. and i'm scared. like i look in the mirror and i shriek in horror. i mean, i don't know, i haven't had a proper face wash for some time now, so my face has completely broken out. i look terrible. and i've gained some more weight too (no more!) so i'm feeling very self conscience lately. it didn't help that i was microwaving something and my dad goes (no joke), "oh my gosh what's the matter with your face?" i just glared at him, and he's like, "no seriously what is it? it's all red and stuff..." i just walked away. no tact at all. i mean, when your talking to a self conscience teenage girl who is already upset and stressed, is that the best way to confront them and make them feel better? i think not.         we went to go see mary kate and ashley's new flick, "NEW YORK MINUTE." i don't know how it got one and a half stars while van helsing got two. not fair. i thought the ending was way cute. mary said the girl from mean girls reminded her of me. i'm scared about what ways she is comparing us. tomorrow i have a party at my friend Becca's house. very jewish. very cool. i'm excited, but i don't know if i can go yet, seeing as my mom hasn't given me permission yet. i have a lot due soon. so much homework for the next few weeks. i'm just looking forward to the summer, where i can feel the sun beat down on my back, and i won't have to wake up at 530 anymore, and when i can write or jog or whatever. i'm just excited to have a little freedom i guess. this is the last summer when mary will be intact with the family, so i don't really want to spend it watching T.V. i'm thinking about doing something worthwhile.  i wish i could take the fencing programme at hockaday over the summer, but we'll be gone on the dates. so i'm hoping that when i come back i can take some swing lessons with anto and some boy. where i will find this boy i don't know. maybe i'll make guy friends this summer. probably not.  i need sleep. i need a break. i need a boyfriend. enough ranting. i need TOM FELTON THAT'S WHO.

       the greatest... ever The missing arm of Victor Krum, by Harry and the Potters Oh Ron, you were so glad when you got that Krum figurine but now, things have changed, or so it seems and we wonder if it it's because of hermione because after the yule ball, i found the missing arm of victor krum underneath my bed oh ron, as a wizard we expect a little more from you because at hogwarts they don't teach pokey things like voodoo you should know that dismembering figurines of her enemies won't help you impress hermione,  she's not interested mutilated toys what is it with you and her.

       OK. mom left today, and dad leaves tomorrow. and then, we all leave, except for dad, on sunday. i am so very excited. i've been craving adventure and travel for a while now, and i'm totally ready to go on this trip. there is a possibility that i could meet tom felton, seeing as he's having this fan club meeting july 17th, the day before i leave. we'll see where it is, etc. i don't know yet, but that would be totally cool. had an orthodontist appointment today. no new news about when i get my braces off, meaning at least another 4 months or more. GREEEATTT... i don't think i'll ever write those stories i said i would write about earlier. soo, you'll just have to spend your whole life wondering what on earth i was talking about, and if it was serious, and if it would have changed your life.  i'm starting to freak out cause i can't find my CD case, and i didn't take it out of the car. either meaning it's been stolen, or it's been stolen. either way, it's bad. jordan may have taken it, but she says she didn't. so WHERE did it go? i'll have NO CD's for europe, how terrible. that's what i LIVE off of. greeattt... better go eat pastrami, clean my room, dream, write, pack, read, and search for my CD case. which i want back.

       too lazy to write about the other stories, but i promise i will do them later! no, no audio post, sorry to disappoint. i didn't want to like, let this blog become just me blabbering on about nothingness... boring. but i'm sure i'll let annie record some stuff tommorrow, if my mom will let me go. it would totally suck if she didn't. that would totally suck.  my room is a wreck. my face is a wreck. and yet, i am insanely happy. wait, no i'm not... wow. i am confused now. i've never been so confused. i'm not happy, i guess, becuase margaret and my mom made fun of me and my looks a lot today. but... for some reason, i just feel... happy. maybe it's the harry potter fan fiction? or MAYBE it's the idea that i can escape to annies house for one last time until i'm flown away for one month with pure familyness.  i'd better go. typing is gnawing the whole in my arm due to the ironing burn i got earlier even deeper, and it's starting to go raw and really hurt.  julia

       so i saw the movie, and it was just as awesome as expected.  i can't find my fourth harry potter book and i'm started to get worried, angry, and scared.  margaret hasn't read the fifth book! i forced her to start reading tonight, sparing her the oh-so-depressing ending. *sniff* so, i'm bored as heck and i just want to find something to do.... arrrggghhh. i'm expecting to get a bunch of different letters from people over the summer, so i'm very excited! i'd better go. and do... stuff....

       Now i'm just doing this out of pure bordness. i don't know the address for where we will be staying this summer, and i need to figure that out soon, before everyone disappears and i don't have time to tell everyone it. the address. ok so it's late, shut up. after leaving carolines house, the day totally sucked. i got stuck in traffic cause it literally rained buckets, and i was late getting home, so mom was in a bad mood with just me, so she said that i was grounded kind of, for being kind of late, even though it wasn't my fault. then, all through the night she kept on making references about how great margaret is and how hard she worked today, and how i only did a measly 45 minutes of ironing. and just when i thought it was all through, my dad piped in while i was busy making my peanut butter and jelly sandwich right before going to my room, and he said such mean things about how this was "my cake"  that my mom had spent all day working on, and how i should've help make it, so he ended up really offending me cause i worked all day yesterday (but does that matter? no) so i went up stairs while he was yelling at me and that was at like 930, so then i sat down and moped around and then i read some more chapters out of jane eyre. then, i cross stitched a little, and then read some more, and then looked up some motivating quotes to try and make myself happy. i'm depressed for mary, and that is a weird situation. like, i'm so sad that she has to leave college, cause i know she really enjoyed it. so then later on tonight i wrote some more of the book that i'm writing, and then, i came here. and that is where i am now. and there is a moth in my room and i don't want to go to bed in fear that i will swallow it in my sleep or something but i can't find it but i know it's in here and it's one of those pantry moths that i seriously detest and i just want it dead but i can't see it and now i'm angry especially cause i couldn't go running today and i'm sick of my whole family yelling at me and sometimes i just wish that i could curl myself into a little ball and wrap myself up in my bed sheets and close my eyes tight and never wake up because i just want to sleep and dream about water lilies and flowers and fields and sunlight, and i just want to dream about flying over the highest cloud or diving into the deepest ocean, now is there really a problem with that? it's not suicidal or anything, i just want to be left alone by my family. i want to dream that i am something other than the plan. boring. julia. i am. now.

       Ok, so like, today i totally drove to carolines house off of greenville, where i am right now, writing in this blog here, and i was like, "ahhh! scary black man in the car next to me is going to stab me cause i'm listening to snoop dogg way too loud!" so i hurried to find her house. where i am now.  so we're all really bored. and want stuff to do. and stickers for my voiture, i mean car. and now. now i'm writing the same thing over and over and over and over again. *A message from Annie Black* yo. sup. boss. i like computers. and blogs. so today i totally failed my eye exam for my permit and now i have to go to the eye doctor...which i already knew but is still depressing. because i want my permit, darn you! that's right. i'm talking to you. because it's your fault that my eyes are bad. errrggg... *A message from Caroline Bruff* dag yo. So right now im like totally laughing at Annie for failing her eye exam! HAHAHAHA! So now we're gonna go make some macaroni and CHEESE.........  now that that is all done, i'll finish. so we're making macaroni and cheese now, and then we're going to find some stickers for my car. and then, i don't know what. will happen. cause life throws lots of curved balls. word yo. that was deep. like a pool. or an ocean.

       reading mary's post from the other day on her blog depressed me so effing much. she's like, had the worst of of the year i could think of. and the way she closed it was depressing too. and how she talked about what it feels like to have friends, was depressing too. and about mark, that was disappointing and depressing all in one swirl. so now, i'm depressed. obviously. hopefully mary was just in a bad/depressed/sad mood, and that's why she was saying that stuff. there is another huge storm going on outside, and one clap of thunder was so strong that i heard metal outside shaking. it excited and frightened me at the same time. i love storms so much, there is something so fascinating about them. i ran in the race for the cure yesterday, 5K, and though i've whined a whole bunch about how sore my legs are, i had a really great time doing it. i ran most of it, which was really hard seeing as i haven't gone to work out in a very long time. so, that just helped remind me of how good it feels to work out.  i played the age of empires until like 1230 this morning, monday morning, and i've realized how much i really do love that game. i was so close to finishing my wonder, and then ramses II had to come up and be like, i beat you cause i built mine before you so ha, and now i'm all sad cause i was so close. so i'm playing it again tomorrow.

       I haven't written anything of importance in a long time, so now i will do just that. Yesterday i drove over to Annie (the delayed birthday girl [it was march 3]) 's birthday party. i was the only one there for a while seeing as all the other people to arrive (antoinette, caroline, and courtney) wouldn't arrive until 430 or later. so, annie and i watched strictly ballroom which i haven't seen in a long time. i forgot how great that movie really is... bogo pogo. anyway, so after the movie, i think what happened was annie and i hung out and listened to my flogging molly CD, following which we listened to neutral milk hotel, which i must say, i am a great fan of now.  once everyone arrived, we went up to annie's mattressed out spare (kinda) bedroom and jigged a little bit and then did eachothers make up, etc. girly things you don't really want to know about. afterwards, at about 730, we went to mondo's, an italian restaurant, and spoke the whole evening in british accents. it was quite fun actually, and sometimes our british accents would pop up later in the evening much to my delight. after dinner we went to annie's house to "freshen up," and waited for taarini, another friend from school, to arrive. once she did, we finished getting ready and left the house to go see HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. we left at 1030 and the movie started at 1201. so, we sat in the theatre admiring cute boys and talking with annie's brother and his friends. there was a girl seated in front of us dressed up as harry potter, and she went up to this person dressed as professer lupin, which i thought was a guy, and started grinding up against "its" lap, but then i found out it was a girl, and i got a little scared, because harry kept on walking up to people and sitting on their laps and making out and stuff. so then, once the lights dimmed and all the incredible harry potter fanatics started screaming, i must say i started shaking with anticipation. after like half an hour of previews, the movie finally started. i loved the whole thing. draco malfoy was especially good looking in this one, and i find that i must see it quite a few more times to satisfy my need to see him. anyways, the movie itself was brilliant. all the actors have gotten much better, especially daniel radcliffe. it was a lot more emotional and such, and i thought that it was the best one yet. once the movie was over, we got back to annie's house at about 300, if i remember correctly, and went up to her room. courtney went to bed like straight away, that is after we played clue and i totally won (mr. green, kitchen, lead pipe, booyeah!). the rest of us left the mattressed out room and went to annies room after disrupting courtney too many times and also after taking multiple glamour shots. we played have you ever, i lost, and truth or dare, which ended up really leading to a conversation about our history of friendships. and how we all have no boyfriends.  at about 615 in the morning, i tied a knot with a ribbon using only my feet, when i was upside down lying on my back, onto one of annie's drawer handles. we were all delerious by that point. we were quoting harry potter puppet pal skits, singing the mail time song from blues clues, and irish jigging. we hadn't slept at all. at about 600, antoinette surrendered to bed the wussy. at seven exactly i bolted downstairs yelling, "it's christmas, it's christmas! happy christmas caroline!" while she yelled similar things to me. we were very tired.  the internet still wasn't working (it always stops at seven at night and then randomly starts working again the next day...) so we sat on the couch to watch a mighty wind, but i fell asleep at 740. i was awaken by a very annoying antoinette tapping my forhead at 1115. that's when mrs. black let us eat the crepes she prepared for us. mmm... so good.  AH! I FORGOT ABOUT SOMETHING! the previous night, after dinner, caroline, courtney, and i rushed back to annie's house before she did, to construct a fake cake out of cardboard, prepare new icing, and ice this cake, in time that she came home and we told her that patrick, her cat, knocked it off the table. we even put some icing on his whiskers though i think he licked it off. when she was cutting what she THOUGHT was a real cake, it caved in and we all had a good laugh, while bringing in the real one. ok, done with my flashback. everyone slowly trickled away until antoinette, annie, and i decided we wanted to eat at mi cocina, so we did. and then, i dropped antoinette off at her house, and then returned to my house to do the ironing. and here i am, wanting the neutral milk hotel CD and tom felton. sigh...

       anyone know any good wake me up kind of punk rocky music? i want to make a mix... soo. haven't done much today. hung out around the house. drove over to school to save some files and such. then... came home, did nothing. now i'm here. doing nothing. sooo boring. i was supposed to go see a movie with kristi, but she decided that she wouldn't answer any of her phones, so that was to no avail. maybe we'll see mean girls at 740, depends on when her babysitting job ends. argh. i need to clean my room. i need a boyfriend. i need to stop whining. i won't ever learn, so don't bother. I looked up Oliver Cromwell on the internet last night seeing as i blanked on what he accomplished. that sort of freaked me out. school is over... hello! oh well, i guess my curiosity never ends no matter what it is i'm curious about. i want to go shopping. i want to travel. i want to leave texas. i hate it here. oh well, i'm convinced that i will enjoy my summer this year, no one will spoil this. i'd better go. i should be cleaning my room. and listening to flogging molly.

        it's the last day of summer. I am sad about this. well. gotsta go and iron... AGAIN!     Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though  You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  And I probably forgot to tell you this Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel? See you're not what I expected But you're the only one who knows how to handle me And you're such a great kisser and I know that you'd agree  You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  I hope you can forgive me for that time When I put my hand between your legs And said it was small Cause its really not at all I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down Just to keep you around Causethe day you realize how amazing you are You're gonna leave me  You're the only one who Hold my hair back when I'm drunk and gets sick You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  You're the only one who Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams You're the only one who Knows exactly what I mean  Exactly what I mean  Well I saw you with your hands above your head Spinning around, trying not to look down But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground

Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voiceI'll be right beside you dear  Louder, louder And we'll run for our livesI can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say  Slower, slower We don't have time for that All I want is to find an easier way To get out of our little heads  Have heart my dear We're bound to be afraid Even if it's just for a few days Making up for all this mess.  Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear.

       Ok so the other day, i went to a wedding for chelsea l.'s sister, and gueeess what? i totally caught the bouquet! yep, i did! i feel sooo sorry for mary. i totally understand her pain, even if it is only 50/200 understanding. i wish i were in edinburgh... not only to give her lots of hugs to comfort her, but also... cause it's scotland silly! i'm very tired and my eyes have been itching for three days. tonight was the third time this summer that i had a terrible nights sleep. i couldn't fall asleep at all, and i keep on having this very odd dream. it always involves the same dock which allows you to cross from one island to the next. it's weird...&nbsp; i mean, there was an important character in it, i don't remember who or why they were important.. and there was also a bengal tiger, a crocodile, and i was afraid that i would be eaten by purranahs. and, in the end, i needed to get to the other side of the bridge, and i fell in the water, so i grabbed ahold of this piece of board to swim to the other side, when i see the crocodile, and in the end, i got eaten by it. it was rather greusome i'm sure there is some profound thinking involved in this... but i don't  reaaaalllly&nbsp; feel like analysing it.  so anyway. not much else is going on. i'm very envious of margaret because she's in california, and i absolutely love it to death there. like. oh so much. especially the san diego area.  my dad came into my room this morning and said that there was something rotting, what's rotting! and i was all like yeah i think there is. i do think there is something... in both my room and my bathroom... eek... summer does STRANGE things to a person. have i said that already? well, it's true. i've really got to clean my room. here, i'll make a list.    Things to do:      clean room  do summer reading and journals  finish scrapbook--france  start scrapbook--england  get saddle oxfords  get a kilt for school  start working out on monday so you can pass fitness testing    that's all i can think of. i'll come back with more later. ok, now i've got to go.

       i don't want to whine about how much i miss england for the sake of everyone's insanity, but i am REALLY really sad about it. oh, and i'm also angry because today i was too destracted to remember the ortho appointment i've been reminding myself about for&nbsp;a month, and it was a very important meeting. and now i'm very very upset with myself. and i have a lot of make-up cleaning work to do and i can't do anything for a few days because i've been doing non stop stuff. and the streets song "dry your eyes" makes me sad because that also reminds me of england. and i'm also angry because SOMEone scratched my MCFLY cd and now it skips! SO ANGRY! ok, i've said what i've come to say. hope your happy!

       ok so i'm back. and i am not so happy about it. babysitting my little brother and waiting for my mom to return home. she's out running errands or something. so, i'm really really sad to&nbsp;be home. like, i'm sad that i had to leave london and mary behind (she's doing an archeological dig in scotland. she just found a piece of saxon pottery dating back to the 9th or 10th century!) but i'm happy to be with my friends and family (well.. my dad. he's the only one we had left behind). i just wish i were in london with my friends... and family. soo school starts in like a month. but seminary starts in a couple of weeks. THAT i am SO NOT excited for. i'm sorry, it's just... 545 ugh. so, i'm not obsessed with harry potter fan fiction anymore. thank goodness that is overwith. now i realize what a freak i was. am. was. and gosh what people must have thought of me. wonder how it wraps itself around people so much. summer can do weird stuff to a girl. weird stuff. like break their habits. and stuff.  ok, i'm getting tired of writing, so i'm just going to end with the fact that today i got to see a cinderella story and am officially totally jealous and wish my life could turn&nbsp; out that way. well, except for the dead dad and evil mom thing.

       wow school is coming very very very fast. dang it. so anyway, today was OK. annie wants to kill bush (i was flabbergasted by that. annie, it may take some time for me to heal. i don't... i don't know how long it'll be till i gain my respect for you back... i'm sorry...) anyway, so today, margaret and smith stayed home from church (wussies) and mom made a really good big dinner. but all i really ate was rolls, water, meat, and strawberry tart. mmm... strawberry tarte. tart. argh. anyway, back to studying for me!

       well what an interesting day it has been. indeed it has. i've been very very moody. i woke up rather early because the phone was ringing and my mom needed me or something. anyway, so, today, i stayed home until my dad decided that me, margaret, mary, smith, and himself should go see M. Night Shymalan's  the village .   so, i'm like, whatever. so we go see it and i like it quite a bit. it took me a bit of thinking and mulling to decide that i did like it, but i did. anyway. so. we saw it and then came back home and had to clean. and margaret and smith disappeared for quiiite a while to go get goggles and stuff. anyway, so we cleaned, and they came back. mary babysat for the bluhms from like, 4-9. and margaret, andrew, zack, and i went to the pool, but i just went mainly to leave the house. i didn't even have a swimsuit on. i just sat there, mulling, again. i think i've been in a bad mood ever since mary and dad made fun of my weight. the only reason it struck a chord, cause i know they were joking (well, i know mary was, i think), because it just reminded me of how close the pacer is and how much i need to work out, and how little i have been working out. and then, dad decided to take mom out. so, smith and margaret babysat (yeah, more like made out. psha) so, i was all, "whateever." so, i went up to my room, all angry cause smith has been a little mean tonight, and so has margaret, thought they may not know it, and listened to three days grace, "i hate everything about you." good angry music. geez. oh yeah, and i screamed a lot into my pillow. i think i cried a bit too. somewhere in there. the only thing really, that made my day, were two things. one was that i got to talk to annie cause she got back from wyoming today or yesterday i think. (wait, three things). talking to her makes me happy (thanks annie!). second thing that made me happy was i got a postcard from wyoming, from annie. ha ha she's always in my life somehow. and the last thing is mary let me drive her to micky d's to get some mcflurries for the luvers over here, and a coke for her. dang it today kind of sucked. summer of dreams, you abandoned me a month ago. why must you leave me alone like this? OH CRUEL SUMMER OF DREAMS, RETURN TO ME! oh my oh my. well. whats today, the seventh? well, school starts soon. i'll tell you a secret blog. i've been studying ahead of time. on one hand, i'm proud of myself. on the other hand, i'm secretly proud of myself. ha ha. well, this has been one large block of venting, eh? well well. i'm in the library updating this. listening to some wicked bad music. i'm going to cry soon, i can feel it. oddly enough, listening to snow patrol always makes me think of old school memories. like, exam memories, etc. it's kind of fun. but mostly, it makes me want to go back to school (and that's not good, is it?) arrrgh. pirates arrr cool. smith told me a joke last night, right before margaret got mean to me. it was, "where does the king keep his armies? in his sleevies!!" i thought it was cute. i'm still upsessed with the crux anasta. the ankh. i'm funny sometimes. i get so into things. well, enough for tonight.

       Hullo! Today sunny comes in. actually, he should be home, here, in a couple of minutes! i'm very excited and i hope this time we get to hang out more, because all the other times he didn't. anyway. i recently discovered the wonders of cocoa butter-- go buy some. it's amaaazing. last night i had a weird dream.... we were in the future, right? and staying in my room was some weird lady from the movie cold comfort farm, and daniel radcliffe. in jordans room, the one i'm sleeping in right now, tom felton was sleeping. i mostly paid attention to dan though. tom slept a lot. i was on the steps talking to him, but he was twelve again. so i picked him up and kissed him on the cheek and forehead, and said how cute he was. we went down to the kitchen with uncle dan and my aunt jane, and mary, and dad, and then our house, which is apparently mobile, left. so we're like, dang it, we have to get them at the mall. so we walked around the mall, and dan became fifteen again. and we kissed on the stairs. and went into these expensive stores which actually had some thrifty items. i remember a pair of earrings with beavers that had blue stars on it's tail. anyway, so then, there is this ride in the mall, and dan goes in it and disappears. so we go searching for him. i think i run into tom and we made out or talked or something. and then, the mall was about to close, and we NEEDED to find daniel. i think, the whole family separated, and we all found eachother in the end. it was very odd. the mall reminded me of valley view at certain times, but it had some futuristic touches to it. bizarro. anyway, it was weird how i liked dan more than tom. everyone knows i love tom. but dan was SO NICE to me in the dream. it was weird. i'm going to go, i'm watching music videos and mulling over that... dream.

         Stuart's enthusiasm for everything - including the most challenging tasks - knows no bounds. And although the A grade student's expressions for all things great occasionally make a detour through "cool" and "awesome", there's just one word that sums up pretty much anything from Boot Camp rations to ice cream.... "amazing".   We take a look at how Stu perceives day-to-day items and activities.    On parsnips  "They're amazing."    On baked beans on toast  "Its amazing - it's like a standard issue meal."    On designer Christian Lacroix  "Who's Christian Lacroix? Is he amazing?"    On skiing  "It's the most amazing thing."    On sleeping  "I had an amaaaazing sleep last night."    On a task that involved the housemates plummeting into a trough of fish guts  "This is an amazing task."    On completing an obstacle course comprising a fishy tunnel, a manure trough and a balance beam in a bed of stinging nettles  "That was amazing."    On being given an ice cream machine by Big Brother  "Wow! That's amazing!"    On discovering that the ice cream machine dispenses strawberry, Smarties or chocolate ice cream  "Seriously??!!! SERIOUSLY??!!!!!! Woah! That's amazing."    On the procedure for erecting miniature boats in bottles  "That's amazing, that is."    On the basic rations provided for the Boot Camp task  "We eat amazingly in here - even this is something I wouldn't dream of having at Uni."    On the prospect of winning Big Brother  "I'd just feel even more amazing."      We'll have some of what he's having...  Here's to you here's to me best of friends we'll always be if we ever disagree (one finger in front of mouth) (whole hand in front of mouth) here's to me  september 13th = la calle doce day

       Ok so on July 31st when i said i was sad cause it was the last day of summer... i meant July. meaning that school would be starting soon. tomorrow, plano schools start. that sucks. monday, seminary starts. that sucks even more! i need to take a shower REALLY badly, but my  mom is  gone with jordan, zack is playing at his friends house, and grandpa is sitting on the couch. meaning, if zack got injured, i'd be in the shower and couldn't help him. anyway, i don't know if anything fun is planned for today. my room is getting better, slowly. i don't have any clothes to wear cause they're all in the dirty clothes pile. also, i need to start working out. i need to be fit enough to do well in the pacer, sit ups, and push ups in school, otherwise i'll never be exempt from p.e. and that would suck because i need my p.e. exemption to do homework that i can't do while training. arrrgh. what else what else? last night i stayed up late watching i love the 70's. i'm falling asleep quicker than i have been, but that's still kind of long. takes me about thirty minutes to fall asleep. my teeth still really really hurt. like, a lot. stupid stupid braces. i wish my mom would come home so i could go shower. then jog on the tread mill, etc. i think i'll go get my brother so that he'll stay in the house while i shower, and will just run in in case of an emergency. i have a lot of stuff to do. i have to get new uniform shoes, and some new kilts. i have to go to acadamy and buy some sweats. i have to get mary her birthday presents. i have to take down the laundry, clean my room, save up money, finish up summer reading, watch i love the 90's, etc. anyway, i'm gonna go. i'm sure that there are some things that i could be doing right now that are more rewarding than typing on my blog. sweet. julia

        ok, so today anto and i went to mi cocina at one o'clock. after we split bean and cheese nachos (yumm) and tortillas, we drove down to my neck of the woods and went to originally see cat woman. but right before it started, i had a panic attack... cause it was cat woman. sooo... we went next door to see HARRY POTTER again. which was even better the third time. after that, i drove anto home after we stopped by the gas station for gaziole because i was on way empty.    after that, i drove home to find a note that says that my family went to go see a movie and that they'd be back at about 720. i was upset to say the least because i really wanted to see that with the family, and i found grandpa lying on the couch. anyway, i think my grandpa keeps on opening the door to see where my family is. which is kinda sad. and annoying. i'm going to clean my room for a little bit. cause i want to have that princess kinda a room. we'll see how that goes. hmm... well. i'd best be off. gotta go see what my grandpa is doing and i've got to work on the room. argh.

       Ok so, i'm sitting there with my grandpapa (shack) and i'm complaining about my room and how i have to deal with antique furniture (lame, right?) and he's like, "so,you don't like waking up as if your in harry potter, huh?" and then it struck me. if i just cleaned up my room, i could wake up like a princess everyday. i would be just like hermione granger! i mean, how awesome is  that?  i know. i know. so, right now i'm cleaning up my room, cause i've only got a few more years in this room before i leave for college (the idea that i'm going to college in a few years freaks. me. out.)  and i might as well make the best of it, right? plus, i've gotsta get all organised before the school year starts, otherwise it will be bad. seminary starts  next monday.  personally, i can't believe it. that is so soon. 520 am. all over again. i could cry. and i have no idea who my teacher is yet. it also sucks cause i'm not going to be in the same class as most of my friends cause they're all juniors and i'm a sophmore. sucks even more, right? i know. anyway. i think that's about it. yesterday mary and i went on a run to taco bell and micky d's. mary doesn't have a lisence anymore, so i drove. wick to the ed, i know. i know i know i know. i've said that a lot lately, haven't i? plano schools start august 4th. is that not completely ridiculus? where did there summer go? i would ABSOLUTELY HATE to start school wednesday. i can't even imagine it. ughhh. anyway, annie's out of town. she'll be gone for a week i think. then, anto is leaving thursday, and caroline left friday. i mean, this sucks. EVERYONE IS GONE. oh well. i put up this away message that says, "can you still feel the butterflies?" and underneat that, "p.s. i love you, forever and today." and all these people IM me like, "soo... who's the lucky boy? when did you start dating?" and i'm like, "i'm not dating anyone... i wish. those are lyrics." and then it makes me sad that i have no boy to hug and call my own. such a girl, aren't i?
