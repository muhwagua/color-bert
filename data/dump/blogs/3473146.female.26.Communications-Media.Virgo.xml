      Veggie burgers are, that is.  I should've figured that rubbery brown patties interspersed with bursts of corn (?) would taste like feet.  Anders and I took a little trippie poo to my version of food utopia in the new Time Warner Center - Whole Foods - last night for some sustenance, and I decided to try something that wasn't a) a footlong stick of pepperoni or b) a Hot Pocket (yes, those have been whole meals for me in the recent past).  Lesson learned: if it looks like feet, it will taste like feet.  Also be forewarned: MetRx energy bars taste like packaged butt.    Have a wonderful Memorial Day weekend everyone!  P.S. By the way, my darling friends, you are all at risk of being mentioned in my blogs (purely in an appropriate manner, of course), AND I have the ability to upload pictorials! MUWHAHAHAHAHAHA.....

      I had never heard of a "blog" before, until I visited the site of the girl who had my current position before me.  At last, an outlet for my wanton, random musings!  This site will allow me to ruminate all I want without clogging your inbox.  If you have some down time, you can log onto my site to watch my inner dialogue unfold on screen.  Though, I realize that this might result in the loss of, oh, all of my friends, as you all realize that I have a propensity to insert "partially shaved badger on crack" into normal conversation.  In the interest of short attention spans, I will keep all of my blogs brief.  But be forewarned: you may uncover a lot of deep-seated rage towards my morning commute and a LOT of disturbing references to partially shaved badgers on crack..........

      I only say this because my legs are en fuego today. I am trying to prepare for my baby 5K race at the end of June (In the midst of people I know training for triathlons, this is big for me. For me to run 50 meters without my head exploding is a gigantic feat).  As I was hobbling along the lower loop of Central Park last night, I became aware of old men with canes, babies and blind people passing me with alarming frequency.  Seriously.  Is everyone taking steroids nowadays and eating those packaged energy butt bars (see post from May 28th) or am I just supremely out of shape?  I need to find more pleasurable methods to not balloon (given my propensity to eat mass quantities of meat products in one sitting).  But given my lack of athletic ability (flashback to grade school where I was generally the last to be picked for sports.  Tetherball, for god's sakes), the only two activities that I would be suited for are a spirited game of Connect Four or flossing.    As an aside, the movie, "Dodgeball," coming to theaters soon only serves to remind me how cruel grade school can be.  It was bad enough that I attended Catholic school with the  urlLink Children of the Corn  (Literally.  Mean little bastards), but to give those vile trolls a large, hard ball with which to hurl with all their might at scrawny, unathletic classmates is unspeakable.  Why don't we just hand out a stick to all the kids to beat each other with?  Have a fantabulous weekend!

      It's happening.  Upon moving to the city, I had heard tales that "New York City hardens people and makes them meaner."  Fresh-faced and wide-eyed, this Arkansas girl had vowed that she would remain friendly and be the  urlLink Guy Smiley  to my fellow city dwellers.  Five years and an attempted eviction by one of Satan's minions in the guise of a 70-year old Belgian woman who lived underneath me later, I am forced to admit that I am meaner.  I elbowed a guy in his white linen-clad ribs this morning who barreled into me at the subway turnstile.  I am finding it hard to refrain from kicking a pigeon in front of a bus (Those damn rats with wings - I could devote an entire blog highlighting why they should be eradicated).  I am developing a permanent scowl on my face and directing it towards men, women, children and Salvation Army Santas ringing bells for the poor.  Stupid poor.  In other news: good god, what is wrong with people?  urlLink Seriously...   urlLink I mean, come on...   Speaking of Sesame Street, was it just me or did anyone find it odd that NO ONE ever noticed  urlLink Snuffleupagus ?  I was 3 years old and even I was screaming at the TV, "Hel-LO!  Does anyone not notice the 7-foot tall brown wooly mammoth behind the Kleenex box?  Are you friggin' BLIND??"  As I re-read my blog, perhaps I have some anger management issues...

      A throwback from the Canadian rapper Snow's "Informer."  To my extreme surprise and horror, this song was one of 50 on the new VH1 show "Awesomely Bad Songs."  He is white, he has dreads, he raps.  What more could you want?  I spent my weekend debating the existence of the Sasquatch, the merits of Color Me Badd (with 2 "D's") and discovering www.weatherunderground.com (apparently, the Weather Channel is SO 1990's) during a college pal gathering at our friend Seth's abode at the Outer Banks, NC.  It was great to hang around old friends as strange as myself.  The only downside: 6 hot dogs should not be eaten in one sitting.    As an aside, if you are easily frightened by horror movies, do not watch "The Ring." I nearly crapped my pantaloons.   I leave you with a  urlLink tragic tale .  My weird friends, you rock.

      In honor of the late Ronald Reagan, I am paying my respects by not coming into work today, hence no blog (my company closed its offices today - I am really not that lazy).  Have a good weekend - thanks for your continued support.

      I was watching that VH1 show above yesterday evening before finishing the Sunday NY Times crossword in pen and beginning my private Swahili lesson (lest you think that I primarily sit drooling in front of inane TV programs).  The family members and friends of some ridiculously wealthy, famous pop star were recounting when they knew their wee one was "someone special."  Apparently, while other tykes his age were eating dirt and generally soiling their diapers on an hourly basis, Future Pop Star had fashioned a piano out of food stamps (because, of course, they were really poor - it's never fun when FPS went to prep school) and started to compose sonatas.  FPS was always the center of attention (I'd like to see how many celebrities' siblings are in therapy) and was a natural singer, dancer, actor and fire juggler.   Upon entering school, FPS snagged the lead roles in all plays.  FPS and one parent moved to LA with $2.50 in their pockets and big dreams.  After being rejected 17,000 times, FPS finally struck gold and became ridiculously wealthy and famous.  As a person titled "Pre-School Bestest Friend of FPS" recalled, "You knew from the day he was born that FPS was special.  He was just different."    As I am currently undergoing a quarter-life crisis and unsure of what my talents are, how they would lead me to what I want in life bla bla bla, I furiously started to rack my brain for anything that stood out about me as a baby/small child.  I thought and thought.  Was I a natural at some bankable activity?  Was I always singing and dancing?  Did I fashion anything out of food stamps?  And I came up with this: I read school textbooks for fun and was a cross-eyed baby.    Damn.

      As I lazily rolled out of bed at 7:42am this morning (mind you, my alarm is set for 7:15am), I began to wonder if I will ever suffer from the disease that has afflicted our parents - rising at 5am to drink coffee, go walking, make sock monkeys - whatever it is that early risers do.  My current morning habits resemble that of a three-toed sloth, with me often emerging from my comatose state well after 11am on the weekends.  In the past, friends took delight in exploiting this by calling me in the wee hours of the morning screaming things like, "Wakey wakey eggs and bakey," which would elicit unbridled rage. I'll show YOU eggs and bakey.  Alas, the tide is turning.  Slowly, I am accepting the fact that as I get older, besides death and taxes, these things are certain: 1) I will rise at the butt crack of dawn to churn butter and water my azaleas, 2) I will get a "mom" haircut and wear jog suits and 3) I will go power walking up and down my street.  God help me.   A MORNING POEM  (Anonymous) I woke early one morning, The earth lay cool and still When suddenly a tiny bird Perched on my window sill. He sang a song so lovely So carefree and so gay, That slowly all my troubles Began to slip away. He sang of far off places Of laughter and of fun, It seems his very trilling Brought up the morning sun. I stirred beneath the covers Crept slowly out of bed, Then gently shut the window And crushed its f***ing head. I am not a morning person.

      My title today is a thinly veiled tribute to that underrated lyrical wordsmith,  urlLink Sir Mix-A-Lot  and the admittance of a problem that I have: a burning desire to organize.  I realized the extent of my addiction last night when I hissed and spat at Anders as he started to put his new boxers and socks away.  I wrested the items away with my cloven hooves, made off with my loot ("Yesssss...my preciousssssss") and began to fold the clothes with the fevered motions of a partially shaved badger on crack (told you).  As I halted in mid-boxer roll (they take up so much less space when you roll them), my thoughts flashed to the papers thumbtacked at right angles in my cubicle, my closet organized according to the rainbow spectrum and my books arranged by height order in my bookcase and realized: I'm a friggin' DORK.  No wonder I was kicked frequently on the playground.    And thanks, mom, for further securing my stronghold on popularity with the black plastic glasses and bowl haircut.  You forgot to give me buck teeth and a skin rash.

      A few things I saw on Wall Street in my morning commute today:  1) A man in a 6-foot tall chicken suit striding by briskly with his Wall Street Journal 2) A young lad of 26 (what a delightful age!) handing out free coupons for Curves, an organic and washable feminine product 3) Men with machine guns eating Krispy Kreme doughnuts  I am assuming that no one else sees such things on their commute to work.  I have truly made it.    Speaking of chickens, I have finally ventured into the realm of cooking.  When I was younger, my mother banned me from the kitchen for 2 years due to a myriad of garden variety accidents - kitchen set ablaze, ruined Christmas lobster dinner, mistaking the carrot peeler for a toy to be rubbed between your hands.  I had viewed the kitchen and all of its related equipment with the confusion of Saturday Night Live's character, Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer ("Your advanced machinery, this box thing you call a stove...confuses and bewilders me...I am just a simple caveman...").  I would watch my former roommates, Andie and Shana, skillfully whip up meals such as "foie gras/anchovy terrine in a citrus chutney sprinkled with tarragon marinated in a hibiscus-date puree" (Huh?  I wouldn't recognize a chutney if it clubbed me over the head with its chutney tentacles or whatever it has).  During last fall's blackout, I realized that, if not for Anders' tuna and corn stash, I would be feasting on a concoction of Trident, ketchup and lint assembled from the abyss that is my refrigerator and cupboards.  As my current job has afforded me free weekends, I have attempted to master this wily activity.  My first cooking attempt was met with enthusiasm, though I somehow screwed up the "2-minute in the microwave gravy mix" (I covered up my faux pas by selecting the crunchy gravy nodules for myself).  With every weekend, I am gaining confidence and adding complexity to my dishes.  Next weekend: making pasta with sauce.  I hope I can do it.

      I mentioned in a  urlLink June 3rd post  that I was becoming meaner the longer I live in New York.  Add "cold-hearted b****" to the growing list of character defects.  As I was walking from work yesterday, a young man approached me with pleading eyes and a brochure.  "Do you have just a few minutes to spare miss?" he asked.  "No, not really.  I have to go meet a friend soon."  Yeah, my friend, the New York Sports Club gym.  "Please?  Just a few minutes?" he cajoled.  I glanced at his blue shirt with the words "International Children's Fund" emblazoned on the front.  Great.  I was turning down helping children.  Sensing me weakening, he moved in for the kill.  "You want to help poor children right?"  If I didn't leave then, I knew that I would be convinced (because I am a sucker) to sign up for an Ironman Triathlon that raises money to find a cure for Botswanan children with three buttocks.  Ducking my head in shame, I mumbled something to the effect of "Um, no habla anglais.  I hate children" and scurried up Wall Street.  This scenario ranks right up there on the heartlessness scale with the legless homeless person asking me for change as I exit Bloomingdale's in a dress constructed of five-dollar bills and heavily laden with bags.  "Do you have a quarter so that I may eat?"  "Uh, no..." as I hurry to the next store, munching on a Krispy Kreme doughnut.  Funding poor men, women, babies, endangered manatees - I reject them all.  I might as well just kick babies and club baby seals to guarantee my seat on the express train to hell.

      I have become a calorie/fat and carb counter.  But not because I believe that I am a skirt-wearing Beluga whale with a genial disposition.  I was scouring the frozen foods section at the supermarket yesterday evening (because the frozen food section is such a bastion of health) and realized that I was deliberating at length on the nutritional value of Bagel Bites and TGI Friday's Chicken Quesadilla Rolls. Consuming either item frequently will eventually lead me down the path to becoming "that other girl" in Wilson Phillips, but by god, if I am going to eat lard, I will eat healthier lard.  This scrutinization is borne from the fact that I have an obsessive personality by nature and will beat a concept or activity to death.  I once got it into my head that  urlLink Fruit Roll-ups  ARE like brightly colored slices of heaven and proceeded to devour 2-3 boxes of 10 in one sitting on multiple occasions.  Most people like bananas, so they eat a couple.  I like bananas, so I hijack a banana truck, pillage it, then break into the monkey cages at the zoo, point and laugh at their diapers and lice picking and steal their afternoon banana stash.  Hence, the food analysis.  "I need to watch the health content in food so my heart doesn't explode, so I will obsessively analyze to pick the better of my crappy options.  I choose you, TGI Friday's Low-Fat Pig Grease in Soy Butter."    And friends, though I have always eaten badly, I have  never  sunk this  urlLink low .

      I was retrieving money out of an ATM on Monday and glanced downward at a receipt that someone had left by the machine.  The slip of paper stated that Customer X had a meager $973,245.60 in their Checking Account #2.  I slunk away from the ATM, shamed by Customer X (how much does he - let's just say 'he' for argument's sake -  have in Checking Account #1??).  If X has that much money in a checking account, why is he even bothering with the poor person's method of retrieving money?  Why aren't rare albino homing pigeons delivering his cash to him via a diamond-encrusted envelope?  Why does my receipt not display many numbers past the comma?    In other news, I just signed up for  urlLink trapeze lessons  with two of my girlfriends.  Oh right.  That's where my money goes.  P.S.  I am having a severe case of writer's block today, plus I just had Wendy's so my brain's capacity is concerned with coordinating with the grease to clog my arteries.  I had initially thought of just rambling on about mimes (though people loathe mimes, they think the mime concept is humorous), but mimes just make me angry.

      I am such a girl.  Luckily for me, I am anatomically a girl, so that statement should come as no shock.  As I was in my bedroom yesterday evening, I spotted a ginormous spider clinging menacingly to the curtain, waving its free legs and baring its fangs in a thinly veiled threat.  In reality, I'm sure it was just taking a nap before reporting to its volunteer work in a spider soup kitchen, but to my frightened self, it appeared as a furry ball of death.  So I reacted in my usual way.  I cleared a 6-foot perimeter around said ball of death (no small feat as my bedroom is 7x10) and emptied half a can of Raid on its sorry a**.  As it fell off the curtain and laid in a pool of chemicals quivering spasmodically, I was not content to let it be.  I sprayed a good 10-12 additional blasts as it lay pleading for me to just shoot it to end its life quickly.  My thoughts flashed back to one evening when I discovered an abnormally large water bug ambling across the floor to, no doubt, meet its wife water bug for their anniversary dinner.  Mistaking it for a cockroach, I called my roommate, Shana, hysterically to scream "Bug! Bug!  We're all going to die!" in her ears before hanging up to grab the can of Raid.  After emptying the can on the bug, I then placed a Tupperware container over it and slapped 2 350-page Vogue Magazines on top, as if it were capable of hurling off the container with its crippled, acid-burned legs to come after me for one last payback.  These critters, and hundreds of others, did nothing more than cross my line of vision and I saw fit to spray them into hell.  It's only appropriate if the bugs of the world unite to throw their suitcases on my clean bed - my own version of hell.

      I have always been an avid fan of concerts, plays, sporting events and the like.  I rabidly scour ticketing sites to secure admission for such events before they are sold out and have almost always experienced success.  But as I was leading my friends, Jess and Greg, to what appeared to be the gates of heaven or "Upper Balcony, Row M" yesterday evening at the Dido concert (Yes, Dido.  In my ascent into maturity, I can no longer attend concerts that contain a mosh pit or backup dancers), I realized that I also have a knack for securing the WORST seats in any venue.  My realization was reaffirmed this morning as I purchased tickets to the US Open Tennis Men's Final and garnered "Upper Upper Promenade, Row ZZZ, Fully Obstructed View, You Must Share a Seat with a Morbidly Obese Man." This situation perplexes and angers me.  How do others manage to snag the 10,000 better seats within half an hour of the tickets becoming available?  I could purchase tickets to the Eastern European Dwarf Tossing Quarter-Finals, and I would still be getting the search result "You have purchased 2 tickets and we are pleased to place you in our reserved leper colony."   I can only look wistfully at the orchestra section, while I am jostling for space among the dwarf-hating lepers.

      I dislike crowds.  I dislike being appraised by construction workers.  These two dislikes converged into one riotous mess as I exited a spa this afternoon during my lunch break.  My colleague Karen and I stepped out onto the sidewalk to find 3,000 labor union members protesting some faceless evil (nothing like getting my nails painted "You're a Pisa Work" to the sounds of men shouting "Die!  Die!" in bullhorns).  They, of course, stopped mid-protest to offer to father our children, compliment some body part (Why is it that they never point out other attributes such as a perfectly color coordinated ensemble or funky accessories?  A "Nice Chanel handbag.  Fuschia is SO fall 2004" might actually work.) and generally stare at us as if we were two Taco Bell chicken Gorditas ambling down the street.  I'm not claiming that we are two hot mamas, as they would probably whistle at a moose with shapely legs, but as there was no high-heeled moose in sight, Karen and I would have to suffice.  The next time a gaggle of men visually molests me or yells out what they'd like to do to me and with what Olsen twin, I have figured out how to counteract the smarminess.  I will stop dead in my tracks, turn around, look them square in the eye and ask them, "What would Jesus do?"  If you can't stop it, make it creepy and awkward.  That's my mantra in life.  In other news, I finished my 5K yesterday (Amidst 17,500 people - perhaps I should not willingly participate in such activities if I dislike crowds.  No one ever accused me of having common sense.) with only a few blind people and a chihuahua in a track suit passing me.

      I was in a toy store in AR last weekend and came across a staple (and a best forgotten one, at that) from my childhood.  A  urlLink sock monkey .  It was years until I was able to erase those creepy tube sock primates with their mouths shaped into a red, eternal scream from my mind.  Come to think of it, I hadn't realized how many truly evil things were accepted as "entertainment" for children.  "Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop.  When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.  When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall.  And down will come baby, cradle and all." What the who?  Parents sang about babies plummeting to their deaths to lull their 6-month old to sleep?  (What the hell was the cradle doing up in the trees in the first place?  Was the baby ugly?)   urlLink Teddy Ruxpin  intoned songs about "The Mushroom Forest" (I kid you not) while staring ahead fixedly, probably dreaming of a day where he didn't have to have cassettes shoved down his back while wearing a poo-colored muu muu.  Most popular stories were seeped in scary images: a spider causing Little Miss Muffet to run away like a sissy, the Big Bad Wolf chowing down on Little Red Riding Hood's Nana,  urlLink Hansel and Gretel  - okay, that is one seriously f'ed up fable.  The stepmom convinces the father to abandon his children in the forest, whereby they stumble onto a witch who tries to eat them.  But luckily, they shove her in the oven and kill her.  Good thinking, four-year olds.  These are examples of nature getting clobbered by nurture with the dodgeball.  Nature produced perfectly normal babies and nurture (in the form of possessed toys and macabre tales) then screwed them up.  Gotta go - must change the bulb in my nightlight.

      Females seem to lack the "efficient wallet handling" gene.  Even I, a girl who can retrieve money from an ATM in 5 seconds with cotton candy for hands, fumble whenever my wallet is involved.  My experience at the Newark Airport Burger King on Friday reaffirmed this statement.  The checkout boy handed me my change, King-sized value meal and receipt, and I quickly ran out of appendages to hold everything, as is the case every time I purchase anything.  The line behind me featured cranky and starving fanny pack-toting travelers who would devour me if I didn't move out of the way.  Flustered, I stuffed the bills haphazardly into my wallet, threw the fistful of change in my fries (because coins involve me accessing a different wallet compartment), swallowed the receipt and shuffled away clutching my open purse and a drink bigger than my head (lord knows where I managed to cram my food).  I glanced behind me and enviously watched as a man placed the bills into his wallet, tossed his change and receipt into his pocket, grabbed his food and head-sized drink and glided away (perhaps I imagined that) with a flourish.  It was beautiful.  He was a wallet gazelle to my wallet baboon.   Actually, baboons have prehensile toes so they would have the ability to handle wallets.  Wallet anaconda then.    In other news, I was at the driving range yesterday evening at 10:30pm munching nachos.  Is that strange?

      I took Anders home to Arkansas this weekend to give him a glimpse of my hometown.  The weekend included spending time at my friend Shannon's dad's lake manse, chowing down famous AQ fried chicken smothered in gravy and touring the booming metropolis that is my town.   AR is a state that is misunderstood.  Exclamations like "Good god, AR must be...interesting", "Wow, I'm sorry", and "If I grew up there, I would've gnawed off my own limbs" used to be off-putting but are now mildly entertaining.  I cannot say that I blame people with preconceived notions of AR, as the state's headlines are generally saturated in  urlLink redneck .  But when asked if they have ever been to the state, the hecklers respond with, "Well, I had AR on a pair of Underoos once..."  Mmm hmm.  Let me shoot down some of your misconceptions: I grew up wearing shoes.  My home cannot be transported easily.  People do not love animals in "that way."  We don't like mimes either.  I've got to go now.  I need to call my boyfriend/uncle back.

      I had yet another dining experience where the service made me reconsider the appeal of Lean Cuisine and a "Law and Order" marathon in the comfort of my living room (though with a night like that, I might as well buy 52 cats and start knitting socks).  Anders and I went to a nice restaurant a few days ago where my requests for water, spit, ANYTHING liquid were met with incredulous stares, as if I had asked politely to devour their firstborn.  Time and time again, I encounter service that mars my enjoyment of the food and ambiance.  To clarify, I am not a high maintenance diva who demands that my penne pasta with chicken in marinara be "altered slightly" to linguine with shrimp and pesto on the side.  I hate confrontation and prefer docility to hostility.  When my entrée arrives with the tail left on my steak, I am more likely to ask timidly if I could please kind sir have a sharper knife to cut it off.  Enough with my doormat personality.  The next time I eat out, I am going to do every offensive thing (offensive according to NY restaurants, anyway) as my response to all of the times I have been ignored when asking for my food (I think 2 hours is a reasonable time to finally ask, don't you think?).  I will toss the wine list aside and order tap water with lemon.  And a straw.  I will repeatedly ask for "some of that free bread you got there."  I will split the bill among 3 credit cards ($20 on this one, $32.59 on this one and $1.15 on the last one) and cash and request that the change is brought in dollar bills.  Of course, the bill split will be calculated via the calculator that I whip out at the table.  And I will ask to have everything wrapped up in a doggie bag.  Ha.  Your loss, oh 4-star, 27 food rating in Zagat's fancy schmancy restaurant is Taco Bell's gain.  At least they give me extra napkins.

      Food and free handouts attract the crowds.  I had college friends who applied for 20 credit cards at those card expos in the University Center to get the free T-shirt (or maybe it was to support their extensive drinking habits).   Chick-Fil-A employs an unlucky pre-pubescent to dress in a chicken suit and hand out nugget samples in a successful effort to lure customers.  As a marketing associate, I have kept the afore-mentioned epiphany in mind when planning presentations or the like.  Almost every person in our group globally attended an early morning presentation today given by a member of senior management.  He could have been extolling the virtues of ankle socks, but no one would have cared as they contentedly munched on free breakfast foods.  The food was later brought down to our floor, where the masses converged on the trays like a bunch of rabid wolverines.  Firms that hand out freebies on the street bank on this natural human tendency to be greedy bastards.  I'm sure that the following scenario is what the marketing departments of companies conjure up when they analyze revenue-increasing strategies.  "Hey Shannon, what did you get back there from that guy dressed as a dollar?"  "A Bank One rectal thermometer for hamsters." "Um, you don't have a hamster."  "I know.  But it's free.  You know what?  I think I'll open a checking account with them."  Let this be a lesson learned: free stuff attracts people, and you CAN buy friends.  (Shannon, I'll get that check to you straightaway.)

      I entered my password to retrieve my voicemail messages at work yesterday, only to be greeted by, "Your password has expired.  Please enter a new password and press #."  The same set of numbers pretty much holds the key to all I do in life, and I would normally add or detract a digit when faced with an expiry date.  But, of course, seemingly simple tasks are always wrought with complexity, anguish and me kicking something.  Below follows my battle with the voicemail system (my computer and ATM have also colluded to raise my blood pressure) to change my password:   Voicemail (VM):  Please enter a new password and press #.  Me:  1-2-3-4-5-6.  #  VM:  The password must contain at least 7 digits.  Please enter a new password and press #.  Me:  1-2-3-4-5-6-7.  #  VM:  The password must contain at least 7 digits and a symbol.  Please enter a new password and press #.  Me:  1-2-3-4-5-6-7-*.  #  VM:  The password must contain at least 7 digits, a symbol and the name of your favorite Smurf.  Please enter a new password and press #.  Me:  (insert expletive) 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-*-Papa Smurf.  #  VM:  The password must contain at least 7 digits, a symbol, the name of your favorite Smurf, but in Norwegian.  Please enter a new password and press #.  Me:  (Trembling in anger, I spot a pigeon.  I kick the crap out of it.  I feel much better.)  1-2-3-4-5-6-7-*-Far Smurf.  #  VM:  The password must contain at least 7 digits, a symbol, the name of your favorite Smurf in Norwegian and what you want in life.  Please enter a new password and press #.  Me:  (I pick up the unconscious pigeon and prepare to kick it.  I spot the boss' pet baby seal spinning balls on its nose gleefully in the conference room.  I club the crap out of it.) 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-*-Far Smurf-TO CHANGE MY F***ING PASSWORD.  #  VM:  I'm sorry.  You cannot re-use an old password.  Please hang up and try again.    Me:  (I quit my job and move to Nepal to run a llama farm.  No passwords needed there.)

      I opened my phone bill last night and let out a primal scream.  The amount that I owed resembled the US' GDP more than a cell phone bill.  Unfortunately, all bills seem to arrive at the same time and usually when I only have enough money in my account to purchase toilet paper (after paying this bill, I will have to try very hard to not go to the bathroom until my next paycheck).  Actually, I may have more (or less) money than I think, but I wouldn't know since I have not balanced my checkbook since the wooly mammoth frolicked in ice caverns.  Ten years of receipts await for me to match to each bank statement on a "rainy" day (Who am I kidding?  More like a day where I am ridiculously bored and have already gnawed off my own limbs), but I am fairly sure that any error made by my bank would not kick up my balance to that of Customer X (see June 16th blog).  Check writing is depressing.  Some banks try to counteract the feeling of desolation that accompanies the metaphorical signing away of your soul by offering bright flowers or cartoon characters dancing across the face of your check.  But I feel that this makes the situation worse.  Not only do I have to write $3,500 in the little box on the right, but I must do so over SpongeBob SquarePants' trouser-clad a**.   I do not need to be humbled any more than I already am now.  Especially not by Verizon and a sponge who holds hands with a pink starfish.      P.S. If you clicked on my subject line above, why oh why is this song listed on weddingvendors.com?

      The Catskills wedding that I attended this weekend was in a setting straight out of this movie, I was told (never seen it, but apparently it is not a romantic comedy).  Setting was beautiful, wedding was beautiful.  However, the town was isolated and marked by dense forests, which only conjured up images of Stephen King and deranged mountain men and reminded me of old -and current- fears.  I was a child who would sneak out after my bedtime to watch horror movies, as I was sure that life existed outside of "The Golden Girls."  Elderly women living in a retirement community made for great entertainment, but ill-tempered monsters chasing teens in the woods was far more exciting.  Unfortunately, my tendency towards the dork side of the spectrum meant that I, of course, soon became afraid of pretty much everything.  "IT" created a fear of clowns, "Child's Play" created a fear of dolls and "Starship Troopers" created a fear of 60-foot tall mutated spiders on alien planets.  The likelihood of a falling piano crashing on me as I walk to work (I pass by TWO piano stores which further validates my irrational fear) is more likely than finding a gentlemen with bad skin, knives for fingers and sporting a Cosby sweater behind my shower curtain, but I still check anyway.  As I cannot go through life without encountering scary situations or the dark, I created a method of combating the irrational fear: picture the "imaginary" monster, psycho in the closet or clown with fangs all covered in fur.  Fur reduces the menacing factor and adds an element of cuddliness.  Which is why people care more about protecting baby seals than alligators (I cannot explain the manatee).  It would behoove a snake to don some fur to improve PR.  You would be far less likely to stomp the crap out of a snake with a rake if it resembled a furry tube sock.    Honestly, why did I ever leave the womb?

      Flying inexpensively nowadays requires savvy Internet skills and a willingness to sacrifice.  As a poor college student, I honed my searching skills and today can usually find fares that will not force me to sell crack to schoolchildren (Drugs are bad, kids.  Unless I need to fly to Arkansas at the last minute.  Then crack is very acceptable).  Unfortunately, as I mentioned above, one must be willing to sacrifice on more than a few fronts to achieve the desired fare.  As I recently searched for inexpensive flights to Beijing from Tokyo in October, I was faced with difficult decisions.  I CAN fly for under $1,500 but I would have to fly at 5am on a Tuesday and return at 1:30am on Wednesday on some regional carrier that looks suspiciously like llamas with motors strapped to their backs.    And I wouldn't land in Beijing, but within "driving distance" of Beijing.  Four connections later, I would land in Scotland, actually.  To get the price down another $50, I could land in Glasgow and try to politely cajole the Loch Ness Monster to please swim me over to China rather than take the connecting flight (I am a little wary of "Llama Air."  Neither Continental nor United made no mention of sea monsters when I was searching for fares on their site).  One guy I know, who shall remain nameless, opted to fly Hooters Air to "snag a cheaper fare" (mm hmm).  A prime example of "making sacrifices."

      My immersion into puberty was a painstakingly slow one - dragged out over a long period of time.  I would get one radical shift in physical traits through the course of a year, which was great because I avoided the awkwardness of "um, you didn't have those yesterday."  Unfortunately, one very crucial part of puberty did not rear its ugly head until a couple of years ago.  In the past, my demeanor mirrored the phrase, "steady as she goes."  I was generally a happy camper.  The Hormone Von Trapp clan just moved in, and I am now certifiably crazy.  I noticed that something was seriously amiss when I suffered a mental breakdown after waiting 20 minutes for my Whopper, Jr. at an airport Burger King in Orlando.  Upon arriving at my seat with Whopper, Jr. in hand, I flung the burger at the tabletop in a rage...only to have it fall to the ground, its artery-clogging contents decorating the tile.  I promptly burst into uncontrollable sobs, clutching the few lettuce strands that did not perish.  If this were an isolated incident, I might have blamed it on travel stress or merely my stupidity at tossing my badly desired food like a dwarf.  But then crying was triggered by everything: poignant commercials, sunsets, Tickle-Me-Elmos.  Unexplained anger soon arrived with irrational mood swings purchasing a condo down the street.  Good thing this lasts for only another 20 years.

      My company's spam filter is pretty high-tech, but a few unsavory items manage to wriggle into my inbox every so often.  If one can make character assessments based on the content of their spam email, then I am in trouble.  According to my spam, I am a pervert who is heavily in debt and needs to enlarge, um, certain appendages for half the price.  My Hotmail and Yahoo! email accounts have become strip clubs (unwanted) in their own right.  Most companies block access to those accounts - not because they believe that employees will spend all day on personal email (Don't we already have that?  I think it's called "work email."), but probably because they believe that employees will spend all day closing pop-up ads promising items like "TripleXFlexibleSwedishDolphinLikesSchoolgirlsViagaraEraseYourDebtForever."  Clearly, any site that I visit to order gifts, send e-cards or the like hands out my email address.  So, it's disturbing that purchasing orchids for Grandma from 1-800 Flowers will result in the distribution of christine@yahoo.com to the Flexible Swedish Dolphin world.    In other news, unknown forces today decided that 25 below is the appropriate temperature for the office floor.  The green fleece sweatshirt that I wrapped around me so tightly that someone mistook me for a hyperactive bonsai plant with typing skills is just not adequate.  In fact, I am actually rocking back and forth to generate more body heat, but I think I am going to stop because someone just shouted, "Hey, that bonsai thing is doing aerobics!"

      I arrived at Anders' apartment last Friday evening to find a shiny new white bike waiting for me (The bike will be referred to as Leon.  Why Leon?  Why not?  You will find that I possess the odd girl trait of naming all inanimate objects.  I have a particular fondness for Spanish monikers).  We took Leon to a roped off section in front of the Tavern on the Green restaurant in Central Park.  As it has been sixteen years since the last time I was on a bike, I was extremely apprehensive.  Much to the amusement of passersby, I clutched Leon with one balled-up fist, clutched Anders with the other and bade him to help me roll along, intermittently screaming, "Don't let go!  Don't let go!  Let go!  Let go!  Where are you going?!  Why have you forsaken me???" during the two and a half inches that I managed to cycle.  After 30 minutes of Anders' patiently detaching himself from my sweaty talons, I finally achieved my first bike ride since the age of ten.  As I wobbled along, I spotted 3-year olds sailing past on their 10-speed sans training wheels and wearing blindfolds.  Young children are amazingly fearless.  The older you become, the harder it is to try new physical activities.  By that time, your fears have grown to irrational proportions.  I learned to swim at the age of seven when I knew the definition of the word "drown."   The instructors had to pry the arm floaties, kickboard and goggles away from my grasp.  The exam deeming me able to "swim" consisted of me diving into the water and clawing my way frantically to the pool's edge a few feet away (I was officially declared able to lifeguard standing water in a ditch).  Hence, I rarely do more at the beach than turn on my towel like a rotisserie chicken.  I did not don skates until the age of nine, which basically relegated me to an adolescent of clutching walls in roller rinks and an adulthood of clutching walls in ice skating rinks.  These experiences remind me of the first piece of advice that parents should adhere to (well, besides 'feed your child or it will probably die'): the younger you start them, the less the likelihood that they will be beaten on the playground.  The minute they pop out of the womb, throw them into the Gulf of Mexico.  They might cry a little at first and require expensive therapy years later, but it will pay off in spades the next time they are at a pool party.    Other than that, the Fourth was fantastic.  Good: a weekend spent at my friend Andie's beautiful new home.  Bad: the trip back to New York crouching on the floor in the aisle at the back of the last train car because every seat was taken and sharing the car with a troop of high school kids from an international rotary club.

      I love anything related to words and consider myself to have at least a sixth grader's fundamental grasp of vocabulary and grammar (except in this blog - I flog the passive voice and all rules go to hell out of laziness).  So, it's a little surprising that I have no grasp, whatsoever, of clichés or expressions.  I was on the phone with Anders yesterday afternoon and tried to lend more flavor to a story.  "You know that expression - why buy the cow when you can get the milk for half off," I quipped.  "I don't think that sounds right."  "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk with coupons?"  "No..."  "Why buy the cow instead of the sheep?"  "Um..."  So, it comes as no surprise that I also have the inability to tell jokes.  I mix up characters and situations and often reveal the punchline days in advance of the joke.  Which would probably explain why people think I have Tourette's Syndrome ("To get to the other side!  Oh...sorry...carry on with the eulogy Father Raymond...").  Good thing I never aspired to be the class clown.  I may have locked up "class dork" instead, but remember: people who live in glass houses should buy curtains...people shouldn't throw rocks when they rent glass houses...rocks shouldn't throw people...oh, whatever.

      My friend Jess, star pitcher for one of the firm's softball teams, called me frantically last night trying to find a last-minute replacement for an important game.  I informed her that I was not a good choice, given my history of being picked last for any sports teams.  Jess, athlete extraordinaire, was incredulous.  "Huh??"  No doubt, she had never had this problem.  And no doubt, she was like my fellow Children of the Corn Catholic grade school classmates (see  urlLink June 4th post ) who consistently selected me last or second-to-last (only because the blind kid's throwing arm was sore from a prior week's game) for every team.  Anyone who has ever been remotely unathletic can relate to how cruel this Darwinian method can be.  Grade school teachers were clueless.  A variety of less humiliating selection methods existed: the  teachers  could pick the teams.  What a novel idea.  Instead, I would stand there with the same hopeful grin as the captains (Always the two most popular kids.  Do the popular kids  have  to be athletic too?  Let's show a little creativity here, God.) ran through their selection process almost by rote: "...and finally Pedro, Bess, Antawan, the blind kid, the school hamster, that rock over there and...um...("Me me me!")...I guess...do we  have  to Mrs. Smith...oh really?  For an A?...Christine."  I swear, the captains would make up sports just to pick me last (What the hell is blindfolded rhythmic gymnastics?).  But that was a past life.  I am proud to say that I am no longer picked last.  Ok, that's because there are no sports teams to be picked last for.  But that's beside the point.

      I swiped my newly purchased $22 Metrocard through the subway turnstile this morning and placed it back in my pant pocket.  As I sat down in the car, I went to transfer the card from pocket to purse, but it was gone.  My fellow subway passengers eyed me curiously as I repeatedly stuffed my hands into my pockets and felt around vigorously.  While it is possible that I missed my pocket (Not likely - do you  know  me?  I arrange my remotes by height order), a shady character with a sly grin did bump into me on that pocket's side.  Luckily, I have been the victim of a crime one other time.  I was strolling on Park Avenue with my friend Seth when a pickpocket targeted me.  He couldn't have picked a better person.  My friend Rashad owed me $100 and forgot the check he wrote, so he dropped off cash earlier in the day.  I took out $200 from the ATM minutes before and added it to the $140 (separate from Rashad's $100) that was already in my wallet.  The Prada wallet that I coveted and bought two days ago.  Which contained a newly purchased $20 Metrocard, driver's license and all of my credit cards.  Good thing I wasn't going on vacation the next morning.  Oh wait, I was.  If I could turn back time, I would have added a winning lottery ticket, a list of my PIN numbers with respective mate, my Social Security card and the Holy Grail.  Perfectionist that I am, if someone is going to pick my pocket, it'll be the best damn pocket he has ever picked.    Oh, add Frito Lay's Hot 'n' Spicy Fried Pork Skins to the list of items that taste like packaged butt.  I should have known - the words "fried," "pork" and "skins" were sufficient warnings.

      As I was undergoing my miserable commute this morning, I noticed a sign that read, "Express trains will experience at least 10-minute delays between Stop B and Stop D (basically 90% of my ride) due to track rehabilitation (apparently, tracks can be substance abusers) from now until late September.  The local train is now a lot faster than the express.  You might want to start taking that train."  Translation: If you are on the express train, you are f****d and have fun watching the happy people on the local smoke your a**.  An older gentleman next to me took note of my noticing the sign in horror and launched into chat hyperdrive.  Doesn't commuting stink?  Do I work on Wall Street?  Which firm?  What do I do?  Do I like cats?  Do I like cats in leather chaps?  I am generally a sociable person myself, but I DO NOT like to speak in the morning.  By speaking, I mean opening my mouth for anything other than brushing my teeth.  I am not a morning person and prefer to subsist in just enough of an alert mode to avoid being hit by a car.  Usually, a scowl, speaking to myself in tongues and a well-timed string of drool will succeed in repelling even the most ardent of chatters.  Then, I am left to stew in quiet solitude to later thaw at my desk.  Not this morning.  Next time, I think I will carry a cat sporting leather chaps.  Let's see if anyone talks to me then.

      I have a knack for securing the worst seats in any venue when attending concerts, sporting events and the like, as I mentioned in my  urlLink June 14th post .  However, I only commented on my special skill in obtaining seats in the nosebleed section.  I failed to mention that I also attract what appear to be members of the Yeti family, who apparently obtain the same crappy seats but often in the row in front of me.  Last Friday evening at the film "Fahrenheit 9/11," the usher escorted me to one of the few seats left.  I stepped over a couple and plopped down in my chair, only to discover that I was seated directly behind an oak tree wearing a Polo shirt.  After rubbing my eyes a few times, I realized that the oak tree was in actuality a ridiculously tall man seated next to his equally tree-like wife.  I sighed audibly and proceeded to watch the next 116 minutes with my neck in its customary "thank you god for giving me the leprechaun chromosome" 45 degree angle.  (Though we all were late and had to separate, my movie companions Karen and Ilona lucked out and scored seats behind typical wee New Yorkers.)  No matter where I go or what I attend, some corn stalk with a penchant for my interests invariably follows.  Tall people should quit breeding or at the very least, they should take up hobbies that confine them to their homes (Mulching is an underrated activity).  That way, I can leave my booster seat at home.

      As of late, my desire to exercise has declined conversely to the summer temperatures.&nbsp; When it gets hot in the city, all I want to do is sit in my air-conditioned apartment and rot.&nbsp; So as race time approached yesterday, my enthusiasm matched that of my enthusiasm to scrub the toilet bowl (very low in case you had doubt).&nbsp; &nbsp;But lo and behold, I ended up running the 10K (6.2 miles) segment of the Nike Run Hit Wonder race last night with my friend Karen instead of the 5K (3.2 miles) that I psychologically committed to.&nbsp; The weather was disgustingly humid.&nbsp; I was contemplating starting the race and then quietly dashing into the bushes to hide for the run's duration.&nbsp; But when I crossed the start line, the adrenaline kicked in.&nbsp; And the longer I ran, my desire to kick everyone's a** kicked in. &nbsp;I would target runners ahead of me and focus on overtaking them.&nbsp; I became hell bent on overtaking everyone from runners who elbowed me in the face to crippled pigeons. &nbsp;I became a person possessed, which was odd since my extreme competitiveness has waned in years past. &nbsp;I went from a girl who would almost burst into tears after losing a hard-fought battle of thumb war to a girl who cheered thumb wars from the sideline.&nbsp; But something primitive stirred within me that night and it was this: I really had to go to the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The race  urlLink results  are in.

      Though I am proud of my roots, my last name engenders more frustration than pride oftentimes.&nbsp; Especially when the person who needs the correct spelling of my name has no clue what I just told them.&nbsp; This situation occurs any time I make dinner reservations, call the utilities companies&nbsp;- basically, when I have to tell someone my first and last name.&nbsp; I endured one of the most frustrating situations the other day when trying to book a hotel room in Beijing.&nbsp; As the reservations agent answered the phone, I prayed that she would speak flawless English and would have a hamster who has the same last name as me.&nbsp; Confusion sailed over the phone line when I told her my name, and I realized that I would have to undergo the insufferable "spell it out using other words that start with the same letter" practice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, my name sports about 90 characters, so it took 3 hours to spell out everything.&nbsp; This method was also painstaking as the language barrier complicated matters, and I could not rely on my usual proxies.&nbsp; Unfortunately, certain words are not recognizable globally.&nbsp; "'E' as in 'Edward.'&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Um, um...'erudite'?"&nbsp; (Why is it that all the simple words escape me when I do this?&nbsp; I thought of 'erudite' as opposed to 'earth.'&nbsp; I blame my selection of complex words on my overzealous mother's spelling bee fantasies.)&nbsp; After about 6 hours with the frenetic use of a dictionary later, the reservations agent confirmed a hotel room for a Mr. Pristine Larry-erudite-erudite.*&nbsp; Close enough.  &nbsp;  *For privacy purposes as I will have to beat away the throng of admirers with a stick once they find out my identity, I have used a false last name.&nbsp;

      No one died last night.&nbsp; My friends, Jess, Greg and I partook in our first  urlLink flying trapeze class  yesterday and actually did quite well, considering that none of us are or descended from circus folk.&nbsp; The one thing that concerned me (well, besides doing a face plant on the asphalt below or flying into the Hudson River, as the school is outdoors) was my ferocious hand sweating.&nbsp; The hand sweating does not occur all the time, but when it does, it is ferocious.&nbsp; And when I am extremely nervous as I was last night&nbsp;- quite understandable as I don't normally hurl myself off a platform 23 feet up in the air&nbsp;- the hands can be used to combat drought in third world countries (Botswana has dibs).&nbsp; The school provided a bag of chalk that, as the night wore on, proved futile.&nbsp; As I was awaiting my turn for my final swing to be caught, I glanced down at my just chalked hands.&nbsp; Anders (who only came to provide us moral support lest you think he also donned spandex to participate) glanced over as well and exclaimed in horror, "You've made a paste!"&nbsp; I looked again.&nbsp; I certainly did.&nbsp; The chalk and ferocious sweat combined to form a paste.&nbsp; Damn my hands.

      A lot of celebrities are fortunate to be born with raw talent, but in today's society, talent is not enough.  You need a catchy "star-quality" name.  I went to the Prince concert on Friday night, and boy, can that wee man rock out.  Not only is he a musical genius who can pull off velvet leisure suits and dance in stilettos, but his name is "Prince," for god's sakes, and he was born with this moniker.  His name is ACTUALLY friggin' Prince Rogers Nelson.  To ensure the future celebrity status of your child (For being a single girl of 26, I sure have a plethora of advice to prospective parents.  See  urlLink July 6th  post), make sure you give it a name that: 1) can be used singularly (Madonna Ciccone, Cherilyn "Cher" Sarkisian) or 2) sounds famous (Beyoncé Knowles.  I mean, seriously.  If she hadn't ended up a star, Mrs. Knowles should have dropped her off in swaddling clothes at the nearest manger).  If you don't have a catchy name, change it, as Gordon Sumner did when he realized no woman wanted to frolic in fields of gold with "Gordon Sumner."  Whereas, women would play  urlLink Hungry Hungry Hippos  with "Sting," much less frolic in his fields of gold.  Unfortunately, my parents did not have the foresight to do either of the afore-mentioned things with my name.  Now, I will never have my own E! True Hollywood Story.

      I am writing my post from my new cubicle today as I moved one seat up to accommodate an influx of people to my area.&nbsp; My crappy location just got crappier.&nbsp; In every job I have had, I always managed to secure the least prime real estate in the office.&nbsp; My cubicles ranged from sitting outside the CEO's ceiling-to-floor glass-walled office to sitting next to the men's room, where I received a firsthand education on bathroom reading preferences (Note: if Ralph comes striding towards the bathroom with the Time Life encyclopedias in hand, take a long lunch.&nbsp; It won't be pretty the minute he opens the door to leave).&nbsp; My new cubicle sits right outside of a ceiling-to-floor glass-walled and heavily used conference room.&nbsp; Now, I have anywhere from five to ten pairs of unblinking eyes staring at me at any given hour.&nbsp; I liken it to having multiple stalkers rotate staring at me from afar ("You're up next dude.&nbsp; She really gets unnerved when you lick your lips.").&nbsp; Sounds like I might be moved again according to a conversation I just overheard.&nbsp; Though I'm not sure what "she won't mind" and "Jabba the Hut's lap" means...  Excuse me...that's my  urlLink stapler ...

      I arrived at my friend Greg's apartment last night to find her engrossed in a UPN show titled (I kid you not) "Amish in the City."&nbsp; The show features five Amish young adults living in a house with five city young adults in Hollywood.&nbsp; Conflict and tears ensue ("Get your mule out of my bedroom."&nbsp; "You wouldn't say that if I weren't Amish.&nbsp; I hate you!&nbsp; Let's hook up.").&nbsp; Though I did watch the rest of it, this latest show in the spate of reality TV programs serves to remind me how television now collectively sucks (I think this word succinctly describes the quality of shows nowadays).&nbsp; Networks have declared defeat regarding original programming and now churn out reality TV program after reality TV program.&nbsp; I suppose that networks have to apply  some  creativity when conjuring up unique scenarios now that all of the basic premises have been done.&nbsp; ("What happens when you place four toddlers from different sides of the tracks in a shark tank?&nbsp; Yes, they do get eaten, but watch Wednesday nights on the WB as the shark battles the emotional consequences of devouring the toddlers and looks for true love!")&nbsp; I have to admit that every so often I get snookered into watching these shows out of a morbid curiosity of how people survive their bizarre circumstances.&nbsp; What would I do if I had to live with five Amish young adults?&nbsp; (Since I'm not crazy, I would guess that I would live with them just fine.)&nbsp; What happens when twenty women compete for the affections of one man?&nbsp; (Answer: they cry incessantly.&nbsp; Good lord, you just met him two days ago.)&nbsp; &nbsp;There is one redeeming quality of reality TV shows, after all: these programs identify the crazy people in the world, so it's easier to avoid them.&nbsp;   On a related note, a  urlLink high school classmate  of mine rode the reality TV wave to dubious stardom.

      I was searching this morning on my friend Alice's registry for a wedding gift.&nbsp; For once, I was going to buy a gift before the wedding as opposed to the sixth month in the accepted one-year timeframe after the wedding.&nbsp; Since I usually buy gifts after the actual event, I am normally left with the most expensive items off the registry (oh good, I was hoping to be the one to get her the $900 foie gras maker, since she'll make it so often) or a motley crew of things (for Andie's wedding, I presented the "can't miss 1-2 punch" of meat grinder attachment along with napkin rings).&nbsp; Though my method is not entirely polite, at least I purchase items  on  the registry.&nbsp; Some people find this "boring" and "not creative."&nbsp; Often (not always), these people are the ones who ship a garden gnome to the couple's house because "I'll bet no one else has thought of getting this for the couple."&nbsp; One woman I know decided to eschew my friend Shannon's registry for a painting of Mary, the Mother of Christ.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Where the hell is she going to put that?&nbsp; If she had  wanted  an oil painting of Mary, the Mother of Christ, she would have registered for it at Macy's under the section, "Now I am Going to Have to Return It, You Freak."&nbsp; I am not lambasting every person who decides to strike out on his own when buying wedding gifts.&nbsp; After all, the bride- or groom-to-be may gesture towards the macramé Justin Timberlake during a shopping trip and stare at you pointedly while remarking, "If only I could register for this.&nbsp; Oh well."&nbsp; But people register for a reason.&nbsp; Because they  want  the items off their list and want you to buy it for them.&nbsp; Especially since they just spent $10,000 on a band who is willing to play " urlLink We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off " for the first dance.

      Picking up your developed film from the photo shop is an exciting endeavor.&nbsp; What was on this roll of film?&nbsp; What happy memories were captured?&nbsp; How sassy did I look at that wedding?&nbsp; And then stark reality hits as you open the packet and realize that half the pictures are blurry/out-of-focus and you look like a fat Sasquatch in the other half.&nbsp; I am one of the few laggards that do not own a digital camera, so film development often harbors unpleasant surprises for me.&nbsp; Red eyes, objects obscured in shadow and fat Sasquatches all contribute to making my photographs resemble a horror B-movie ad campaign oftentimes.&nbsp; I picked up my developed pictures yesterday and eagerly tore into the envelope.&nbsp; Flipping through the stack, I declared this group almost a success&nbsp;- every photo sans a few came out very well.&nbsp; Then, I realized the common denominator for all the good pictures: I  wasn't  in the picture.&nbsp; And the common denominator for all the bad pictures?&nbsp; I  was  in the picture.&nbsp; Wearing spandex, no less.&nbsp; Anders chowing down on a box of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Andie constructing a beer bottle sailing vessel appeared 200 times sassier than me just standing there.&nbsp; To ensure untarnished memories, I am going to have to remove myself from pictures.&nbsp; That sucks.

      Though it may seem to some that I will eat anything, I actually have a few rules concerning dining.&nbsp; I abhor most vegetables.&nbsp; I will not eat anything that slithers down my throat (e.g. oysters).&nbsp; I prefer meat that does not ooze blood onto my plate.&nbsp; Add "I will not touch it if 1) my food remotely resembles its prior form or 2) the first thing that springs to mind is 'What the hell is that?'"&nbsp; Saturday afternoon, Anders and I traveled to Queens to partake in dim sum with his Chinese instructor and a few other students.&nbsp; I do like Chinese food, but I generally stick to the basic dishes that are self-explanatory&nbsp;- shrimp fried rice, peppered beef, wonton soup, etc. &nbsp;But Tom, Anders' instructor, controlled the ordering of dishes that day, as he was the host. &nbsp;Suddenly, a waiter plopped down a plate of hot, steaming  urlLink chicken feet  amidst the usual, identifiable dishes.&nbsp; Anders took the plunge and speared one for him.&nbsp; I sat there for ten minutes staring.&nbsp; These feet broke the "resembling its prior form" and "What the hell is that?" rules.&nbsp; The longer I stared, the more inclined I was to fashion the chicken feet into an amulet to ward off evil spirits than to chow them down.&nbsp; Anders then exclaimed, "It's all bone!"&nbsp; I lost my nerve.&nbsp; What iota of desire I had to bite down into a chicken's webbed foot was gone.&nbsp; Chicken feet in a Fisher Price "My First Voodoo Kit": good.&nbsp; Chicken feet to be ingested in a Saturday brunch: not so good.

      When I have a  urlLink bad day , I  really  have a bad day. It is as if God is saying that I exist... urlLink FOR HIM TO POOP ON . I was having one of those days yesterday. I won't go into detail as to why I wanted to kick any living creature or clone my head before it exploded (gotta have backup - this girl doesn't have an extra battery pack). Having such days is not a new thing in this world for most people. But MY bad days are often punctuated by the "final straw." Final straws that test my ability to not run screaming down the street like a partially shaved badger on crack. Yesterday's final straw was relatively mild - the vending machine taunted me with a bag of Lay's potato chips before it retracted the bag (I swear that the machine smirked at me). It would not have been a big deal if I hadn't been fantasizing about salty, crisp, delectable Lay's for an hour. If it hadn't been the one bright spot in an otherwise lackluster day. Prior final straws have ranged from the mild example above to "Seriously, why me? It's not like I club baby seals." One instance comes to mind which illustrates the latter. I was having an especially stressful and busy day in my prior role. Only two of us junior guys ("Dance monkey! Dance!") existed to feverishly finish three important reports that were due that evening before our manager left for about six years for his honeymoon. Dashing out to grab lunch was a much needed reprieve. I stood at the corner waiting for the light to change to cross the street. And that is when...a pigeon crapped on my head. I kid you not. Luckily it dripped off my hair and landed on my new purse. I might as well club baby seals if I'm still going to get crapped on.

      I have a dust fiefdom presided over by a dark dust lord in my apartment.  No other explanation can exist.  Though I do not vigorously scrub down my apartment daily, I do vacuum and dust on a regular basis.  I was sitting on my couch reading a book the other day and glanced at a corner of my "living room."  Dust the size of a small woodland creature had staked a claim by my armoire.  I grabbed my  urlLink Euro Pro Cordless Shark Hand Vac  and eradicated it.  From my vantage point, I noticed that the dust did not operate alone.  I spent the next 15 minutes (this is the time it takes to clean when you live in an apartment the size of a Botswanan grass hut) vacuuming up whole dust villages.  How could this be?  I just vacuumed a few days ago, I don't have numerous ventilation ducts (actually, any) in the apartment and I don't ooze dirt.   I don't even spend a lot of time in my "kitchen" yet I had a large dust ball ask me out when I grabbed a glass of water from the fridge the other day (they are getting quite bold).  Alas, I realized that I cannot win.  I am just going to give in and form a symbiotic relationship with these gentle dust creatures.  I won't become a vacuuming fool if they leave the toilet seat down.  Note: All things in quotation marks to signify that in any other city, the designated area would not be considered as such.

      Any time you alter your appearance dramatically, a sense of nervousness sets in. You're excited because it's something different, but you also hope that no one thinks you're a hideous beast, or worse yet,  implies  that you're a hideous beast. I just whacked off my hair which used to fall three inches below my shoulders. My hair now ends right above my chin. Okay, it's not like I stuck a spike through my nose and connected it via chain-link to a monkey. It's not THAT dramatic. But it IS a little noticeable and will generate comments. Tactful ones, you hope. Mmm hmm. If you ever make an indication that you notice an altered state, you should not end it there. "You cut your hair!" "Yes, I did." "Oh. Could you pass me that banana?" People who alter their state do not want to be told that their state is not altered. "So, I see that you stuck a spike through your nose and connected it via chain-link to a monkey." "Yes, I did." "Well, you really don't look  that  different. Could you pass me that banana?" I am the queen of diplomacy. Granted, I will not tell someone that her perm looks smashing when it looks like a woodchuck vomited all over it after getting stuck in a barbed wire fence, but I will make one nice comment (you can't pretend you didn't notice the woodchuck/fence concoction). Then again, I don't shove elderly women aside when jostling for a seat on the subway. Yet.  I have to throw in an additional tact warning: do NOT tell a hormonal pregnant woman who has probably just finished sobbing uncontrollably at a MasterCard commercial that she looks "HUGE. Oh my god, you're so BIG." Are you a moron?

      While I was sitting on the subway yesterday, the conductor made the following announcement: "Attention all *static*. This is a VERY important *static*. You must NOT *static* or you will *static*. Thank you." This situation occurs quite frequently on the subway. Some important, probably life-saving announcement is made with key words obscured by loud, crackling noises. I sit there wide-eyed, straining to decipher the words that will prevent certain death. Perhaps the conductors take a cue from the local TV stations and their preferred method of delivering news stories. "Breaking news. Three everyday household items have spontaneously burst into flames upon glancing at them. Stay tuned after the 70 commercials to learn how you can save your life." I am not amused. Of course, I stay glued to the set waiting anxiously for the tan anchorman's return. After endless feature stories on homeless cats and the women who love them, the newscaster finally identifies the items, one of which is a Commodore computer. Again, not amused. But before I can become indignant, the anchorman intones, "A certain color has been found to make your heart explode when worn. Please join us tomorrow when we find out how you can avoid a bloody mess." The media seems to either give too much coverage (e.g. the Olsen twin eating disorder) or not enough information for relevant news items (e.g. the suspect in a NYC subway shooting incident was described as "a man"). So now, I'm sitting here at work typing away while in the buff. Damn media.

      I just arrived back at my desk after making a voyage home to change my ripped contact lens (If I didn't go home, I would have run into walls, thereby solidifying my position as the office freak).  I realize that LASIK eye surgery would render this scenario obsolete, but I cannot willingly pay money to have someone peel off my cornea to fix it.  Any medical procedure makes me squeamish, but a procedure involving sharp instruments makes me especially want to toss my cookies.  I have had countless doctors poke me with needles, but I still ask "Will this hurt?" and squeeze my eyes shut every time I am stuck with one while the two-year old in the next room is giving herself a tracheotomy.  I can pinpoint the precise moment where my fear began.  I was a wee lass of about four or five and had to have my blood drawn for a physical exam.  A very overweight nurse entered the room and prepped me for the procedure.  She gripped my arm and tapped my inner elbow, exclaiming, "Boy, your vein sure is a deep one.  I can't hardly find it!" Before I could comprehend what she just said, she began to repeatedly stab me with the needle while asking, "Where's that darn vein?"  If I weren't a runt with rudimentary mental faculties, I would have punched her in the head.  Um, find the vein before you play pogo-stick with the syringe.  I was scarred for life.  Now, I am reduced to a quivering, child-like mess with any medically-related situation.  I have to go now and find a Band-aid for my owie.

      Today, my night will be like any other night - except for the singing transvestites and chocolate mousse-filled Prada shoes.  Tonight, I am attending a bachelorette party for my friend Alice at the esteemed drag show restaurant, Lucky Cheng's.  The evening promises to feature debauchery and mayhem.  The evening also promises to feature me nursing one martini for six hours.  Though I have never been a big drinker, I have sunk to new liquor tolerance lows.  A waft of rubbing alcohol will often result in my dancing on a table.  The opportunities for free mass consumption of drinks have waned since graduating from college.  And with it, my tolerance.  I'm not that heartbroken quite frankly.  While others are vomiting in the corner of bars and grinding against men named Guadalupe (not that the majority of people drink to this state), I will remain vomit- and grind-free at the end of the night.  Some people glance at me curiously at social events when I am clutching a diet Coke with straw in a room full of gin and tonics.  But I would rather be viewed as a girl who potentially collects My Little Ponies than have my head and heart explode (upon drinking, my head heats up and my heart feels like it's auditioning for the play "Stomp") to socially drink with everyone else.  Besides.  Someone has to drive your drunk a** home.

      I have been living in relative bliss for the past six months in my abode (if you exclude the construction project next door that possesses a work permit for the next 500 years), but the past few weeks have been marked by thumping bass into the late evening.  Either the kindly elderly couple in the apartment below is throwing nightly raves or new tenants with a profound disregard for neighborly relations moved in.  Every place I've had since moving here has been tainted by a crazy neighbor experience.  My first apartment in New York featured two girls who decided to furnish their residence with a couch and nothing else to absorb sound.  Said freaks were also fond of gymnastics at 3am in the morning (I now insist upon a "No late night cartwheels from fellow tenants" clause in leases) and from the sounds of their footsteps were professional sumo wrestlers.  My next apartment featured an elderly Belgian woman who hated Shana and me.  Complaints ranged from our "noisy showering" to our "loud and disrespectful tossing and turning" at night.  We actually had to acquire legal help to prevent Belgium's answer to Satan from evicting us for such heinous crimes.  Though my prior apartment had quiet neighbors, I was fortunate enough to be awoken early weekend mornings to the sounds of an opera trilling homeless woman.  Who stood across the street from my bedroom window.  (Why aren't more homeless people mimes? Though I find them creepy and wish them to pretend they are in a box many kilometers away from me, there is something to be said for silence.)  Ah, well at least I had six months of quiet.  Now, where's my glow stick?

      I was reading through the NY Times Sunday edition yesterday and happened upon the "Weddings" section. One of my former colleagues recently married, and I read the couple's announcement with interest. As I had nothing better to do, I skimmed through the rest of the announcements. Some were "garden variety" but others were of the "Who  are  these people?" variety. I happen to be proud of my accomplishments. Though I have not cured any diseases or founded any organization benefiting endangered, furry animals, I do have a great job, nice apartment and people who tolerate me. I'd say that I've done well. Some of the wedded couples featured in the paper were a bit on the ridiculous side. An example (or reasonable facsimile thereof) of one bride's background: "Mrs. X, 26, is the CEO of Citigroup in Manhattan. A Rhodes Scholar, she graduated summa cum laude thereafter from Harvard Law, having founded the Harvard Law Review at the age of 21. Prior to that, Mrs. X graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a double-major in Advanced Quantum Physics and Latin Classics and a minor in Ballet. A fluent speaker of 20 African dialects, she enjoys rescuing beached whales and mapping the human genome sequence, when she's not penning mystery novels." My god, did she ever make mud pies or read Nancy Drew? I am not belittling her achievements (I mean, how  could  I?), but these people scare me. I can easily picture her in a stark room trying to replicate nuclear fusion with salad tongs and a  urlLink Speak &amp; Spell  for fun when the experiment goes awry, reducing her to an insane freak with salad tongs for arms. The backgrounds of the parents of such people were just as freakish. I may be a three-toed sloth in comparison, but at least...I have...nice...knees...right...
