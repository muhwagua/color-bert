      So good to be out of school.. Had a really nice last day.  Came home,  urlLink changed  some  urlLink things .  I'm also going back to the  urlLink old  design.    Also, it's  urlLink round two .  I think I'll syndicate this blog, just for kicks.  Peace.

      Well everyone, the Block final wasn't very hard (big surprise).  All we did was read the short stories.  But, (stupid Malon ey ) made us do the dumbest things.  We had to answer all sorts of questions for each question.  And, he made us list 3-5 qualifications of a short story.  Pretty dum, that man.  Then in the second hour we finish the movie.  It's so sad that  urlLink Jenny  dies from AIDs in the end.  I didn't know that... But now I do.  I'm in another battle with  urlLink Joe  and  urlLink DJ Studios .   urlLink This  is the thread that it's all happening in.  I update the animations on the main page, don't know if you noticed...  TOMORROWS THE LAST DAY!!!

      Yesterday marked the release of a temp.  urlLink bodyvisual , as I'm sure you already know.  I finally figured out how to get the XML into Flash, so everything you see can be controlled dynamically through one XML file.  Also, all together in size it is only about 8kb.  Very quick to load.  Today is the Block final.  I think that it is stupid we have to stay for all three hours.  But, maybe it's just me...  I'll post and let the 2/3 period know what to expect.  All the reports from Monday were really vague.  Anyway, I got that job at the  urlLink College  that I wanted.  Yesterday I sent off my resumé to  urlLink several   urlLink agencies  that  urlLink Brian  recommended, after saying that I couldn't work with him.  Oh well.  The job @ uni is great because they give me vacation time.    Peace.

      Hey everyone.  Well, it's me.  Yep.  Here I am.  Doing what I said I'd never do: making myself a blog.  Anyways.  Looking for some jobs if anyone's interested.   urlLink cv  if your interested.  Also, I should be online soon.  I've been having problems with the XML backend.. can't seem to get the dynamic text boxes to show the text.  Oh well...   That's all for now.

      Well, today marked the first day of my  urlLink job  at the university.  For a first day I worked incredibly long (6.5 hours), but it was fun.  The project we're doing is archiving all the old aerial photos of the region (some as old as 1926).  This includes scanning them in at the best dpi (hell to calculate) and then adjusting the curves in PS so the histogram is balanced.  It seems like it may be a cool project, because there is a web part, which I am going to get, earning me $3000 by the end of the 10 weeks.  After work I was uber tired.  But, I went and took some shots of the gardens because it was a really nice evening.  You can see those pictures  urlLink here .  I am learning better how to focus the camera with the AiAf, and have managed to get several really crisp pictures.  The 4.0 mp does wonders, and the colour is sooo rich!  Take care, TGIF tomorrow x___x  m.

      It's been a good weekend so far.  Yesterday we went to the lake and sailed in a big storm and lots of wind.  It was really cool.  ...signed up for  urlLink Gmail  today.  You can mail me  urlLink here .    Also, PHP is proving to be easy to learn.  I've got a new  urlLink layout  up too.  Looks a bit like  urlLink Joshua Davis .  Not really, tho.   urlLink Peace.

      Due to the amount of personal email I am receiving at my Gmail account, I have changed the password, making the account non-public now.  Sorry to disappoint.  However, if anyone is sincere about wanting their own account, you can mail me  urlLink here , and I'll see what I can do.  Also, I got paid for the first time yesterday.  The check was for 103 dollars, which I promptly spent all but six of.  Hehe.  I bought a sweet little cruzer mini with 256mb capacity and the new tiesto cd (which kicks ass).    Peace out,  michael

       urlLink G-Mail .  For your public account and storage, use the login of  bodyvisual  and the password of  public .  As a public courtesy, please do not change or delete any mail you find there.  Enjoy the 1000mb of free space!  Feel free to use it as a flash-drive-like option, i.e. backing up important files temporarily.  Ciao!

       urlLink Mike  has brought something to my attention about the new Mozilla Firefox 0.9.    [quote] For those of you who have not yet installed 0.9 of FireFox you might want to backup before you do. Some people have reported cases while upgrading that their systems have locked up, then upon restart it executed an infinate loop sucking all system resources until all of the programs crashed. [/quote]  Some users have had to nuke their HDD because of this.  See this link for more details:  urlLink http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports/2003-April/000233.html .  peace out.

      Work is slowly killing my vision.  Right now I have a slight pain behind my eyes, which I have a funny suspicion is from looking at a computer screen since 8:15 this morning.  Earlier I had a major problem with XML, but thanks to a good person at kirupa, the problem was solved.   urlLink Mike  finally got his Gmail account, and told me he has been frantically emailing people all day.  hehehe.  Michelle's back from Korea (or has been since last Monday).  She bought me a 'Be The Reds' shirt because I love it so much.  *hugs michelle*.  Well, back to work.. almost done, just another hour...  *rubbs eyeballs*  I think I'll go take a walk...   peace out  //edit:  I filled up my 256mb flash drive with music today from  urlLink music.download.com .  I really like T1, as I downloaded all that music in less than 20 minutes.  Absolutly amazing.. Too bad they are artists no one has ever heard of.. :)

      I have just released the somewhat beta, somewhat final version of the website for where I work.   urlLink CADIS .  Click to view.   The site has a XML backend, making all the text dynamically updateable.  I'd love to  urlLink  hear what you think .  peace out  On a side note, I think I'm getting sick of this layout.  And, I really wanna add some sort of a shout box-type thing.  Maybe a real cool flash/php-driven chalkboard... that'd be slick...  anyways, lemme know if you find any bugs...

      Yes, I've got 6 more Gmail invities, so if anyone wants these, feel free to  urlLink mail me  and I'll hook you up.  There are a few ppl at  urlLink kf  that I've promised, but not 6.  Anyways, at work I'm almost done with all the interfacing for the blue project.  I'll upload a working version later today, at work.  Yesterday I got some good shots of the garden; will upload later as well.  I had a good weekend overall.  We went to the town I used to live in, and my step-dad went to an old tavern.  hehehe.  peace out.  btw,  urlLink mike  has made a shoutbox and put it live on his site.. Very impressive; i'm envious.  I checked out two books tho...

      So after  urlLink Louis  signed up for blogger and used my previous template, I decided it was time for a general overhall.  Do let me know what you think.  I've modded some things, added some things, deleted some things.    About Macs: I've been thinking very hard about mac or windows.  And I've been reading  urlLink Mr. Hall's  blog.  It seems as tho there are many, many new and wonderful innovations that will be introduced into OS X and Tiger within the next year (more than a full year ahead of Longhorn).  One of the biggest things I want to use is Safari RSS.  I think the RSS searching feature will be s00per cool, and will provide a very easy way to keep up with all the crap I'm to lazy to.  I was talking to  urlLink Mike  earlier about Safari, and he said that it was interesting that I wanted to use Safari RSS and I had never used Mac before.  hehe, shows you how much Apple is getting to me.  Another thing that was  urlLink thrown around  was the possibility of a dual 64-bit windows system being capable of competing with a dual G5.  I personally like the idea of being able to stick with windows, because of familiarity and the software compatibility.  But at the same time I really want a change, and don't all designers use a Mac?  :)  It's raining very hard across the middle U.S., from OK to east TN.  And I burned my tongue.    I have four Gmail invitations for anyone who has not received one yet, or would like to try the service out.  You may email me  urlLink here  with your full name and email address.  It's been so long since I've done any personal design work.  And that's probably because Photoshop is broken on my home computer.  Bummer.    Everyone have a safe, happy 4th of July, and check out my  urlLink work desktop  and my  urlLink home desktop .  Screen manicure for BB tomorrow night!  Whoopie!  peace out

      I just finished watching the  urlLink WWDC 2004  in San Francisco.  It sounds like Apple is really making amazing strides, most importantly against Windows.  One thing that really blew my mind was the new  urlLink Power Mac G5 .  Dual 2.5ghz procesors, 1.25ghz FSB (a win system can't even compete), 64-bits of processing power, and other crazy new features that I can't even begin to describe.  I'm really excited about how cool Macs are now that I've really seen some of the new features that are going to be incorporated into Tiger.  And, to back track a little, the Power Mac's are starting at $1999, and come standard as dual processors (Dual G5, 900mhz FSB, etc).  So, now I'm faced with a tricky problem: Do I buy a Mac for less than (I think) the cost of building a dual processor PC, or do I go ahead with my familiar Windows XP and wait for Longhorn?  It's a tough decision.  One thing that I'm really worried about is the software issues.  I have tons of software for Windows systems that just won't work on a Mac, some of which don't even exist for the Mac (3D Studio Max).  Also, I'm really excited about Safari RSS.  And the new video formats.  And Spotlight.  And the video conferencing capabilities.  It's so amazing what Apple is doing.  I  really  want a Mac now.  You should watch the WWDC video.  It's long, but totally worth it.  peace out

      I have found several good sites for testing X/HTML pages in different browsers.  Here are the links:   Netscape Navigator   urlLink NN Archive  - contains versions 2-7 of NN.   Mozilla   urlLink Mozilla Downloads  - the most up-to-date versions of Mozilla's products.  urlLink Previous Versions  - contains versions 1.0 thru 1.8a1 for download.  urlLink The  Really  Old Versions  - here are versions previous to 1.0 (like, say, 0.6).   Internet Explorer   urlLink Latest Version  - most recent release of IE.  urlLink Standalone Versions  - IE dating back to dinosaurs (v3.0-5.5 sp2). Works best on XP. (Thx  urlLink Mark ).  If you know of any more/different/better sites, leave a comment.  This is just a little resource to help you out if you're ever wondering what your page looks like in old browsers.  //edit:  for a mac view, check here:  urlLink iCapture >

      I was taking time off of work today and managed to find myself at  urlLink 2A .  I got to thinking as I was working my way through the site about how important 2A used to be to me, and how they aren't so much now.  Back in the day (pssh, 2 years ago...) 2A was by far the best thing that I had ever seen.  Period.  It was prolly the reason I started doing flash, too.  But now after I've seen  urlLink such   urlLink amazing   urlLink things , 2A isn't that big of a deal.  It's like they want to be, but it's like they try too hard, and end up overdoing it all.  It's like they are the old school, with there 'super-cool' 25 milligram video that really rocked the industry when it came out.  But now it's like, yea, so what?  But really, don't get me wrong.  I love 2A's work, and they're still going strong after a lot of people have dropped out of the game.  Congratulations, 2A, for fueling today's amazingly talented individuals.  And for taking all the ripping gracefully.  peace out

      Wow, so much has happened since last night, or else it just feels like it.  This morning I went and got my driver's license, and passed on the first try.  The lady was really nice and told me I wasn't mergin right and told me how to do it the right way.  Really cool.  Also, last night some friends that are moving came over to say goodbye and I got into a conversation with them about the best way to buy the Mac.  He said that buying a computer is a process, and that it would be really smart to buy it in pieces.  So, I'm going to save up for the CPU which comes with a mouse and keyboard and just buy a cheap little CRT monitor and then start saving up for the monitor I really want (which is going to cost about $1000 I think...), the 23" HD Cinema Display (not the new one, the older one).  Then after that I'll buy either the wireless keyboard/mouse or get an Airport base depending on if we have DSL/Cable/Satellite by then.  Then I'll get the sound system last as I'm hoping to get a fairly good one.  If anyone knows a site for good cheap computer audio systems, please tell me about it.  To pay for all of this I'm saving all the money (got paid today!) from the internship, and *hopefully* getting a job at MegaByte, the "Apple Store" (really an authorized reseller).  That way I should be able to get employee discounts and I could keep that job part time during school.  There's something that I've been thinking about trying to get started.  Since freelance is so popular and there is so much good talent that is freelancing (I'm talking web, video, and print design) out there, why not make a freelancing design studio?  It would be really cool to have some sort of an agency that has contact with 30-50 freelancers and sets up jobs with them after the client contacts 'leaders'.  Put that way it sounds like some websites out there that already exist, but it would be different.  One advantage would be the ability to have so much talent in so many areas available to the clientele, therefore generating the best product.  Almost like a collaborative effort on a single project with people from all over the globe working through a chat room-like form of communication.  There would be no relocation necessary as it would be totally digital.  Many projects could be processed at the same time unlike a design studio with only 6 members.  I think it's a really cool idea, and I'd love to hear what everyone thought about it.  I'm really interested in getting this up and running no matter how many people would be interested or available right off the bat.  Give me a  urlLink shout  about what you think.  peace out :)

       urlLink Mike  finally has his server back, woo hoo.  His damn host is stupid and takes forever to respond but whatever.  Also, I've been made a moderator at BB forum.  Fun stuff.    The template work is going slow as ever.  I hate the fact that the previous designers were inexperienced and therefore there are 1,652 lines of HTML in one page I'm updating.  But I'm almost done with the first bit.  We got new kitties a couple days ago and they're being a little annoying.  Last night our oldest cat slept with me and woke me up at around 4 a.m. demanding to go out the open door of my room and be fed.  I don't feed the cats ever, so I just shut the door, locking him out of my room, but he scrathed up the carpet by my door and that woke me up.  So after an hour I was like fuck it and got up and threw him out the backdoor.  Literally.  So, overall I got like 4 hours of sleep last night, and I'm definitely feeling tired at work today.  C'est la vie.  The reason I went to bed at 12 last night was because I was watching the movie 'Heat' with DeNiro and Kilmer.  I absolutly  love  that movie to no end.  I started watching at 8, and finished (after numerous interruptions from the cats) at 11.30.  By the time I was ready to sleep, it was past midnight and I was pissed.  But, that's all good.  I'm fairly awake now, with pizza, coffee, and coke pumped into my veins.  But still, it's not a good thing when you wake up with a headache.  I need more sleep and less screen.  I'm keeping my tan from this fucking 20" lcd I live in front of.  Dammit.  peace out

      So over my extended lunch hour today I went and took a visit to the Apple Store.  (I didn't get my DL).  When we got there they had two Powermac G5s sitting there, being beautiful.  I got into this discussion with one of the guys there about basically everything, and I learned a lot, including that Photothop takes eleven seconds (one-one-thousand...) to start up.  That was really exciting.  I mean really.  And they had a widescreen (about 23" I think) that it was set up on.  The entire thing was gorgeous.  And the salesman did a really good job of selling me on the whole thing, even though all he did was say yes to all my questions.  I think that I've decided to go ahead and get a Mac when I've got the money.    Also something really amazing he showed off to me:  Exposé.  He opened up a ton of apps and then hit F9 and magically they all tiled together.  Amazing device there.  I was totally raving when I left.    Hehe, and I got two hang-up posters of the G5 and the Cinema Displays.  Woo hoo, I can hardly wait until August when I have the money for one.  *grin*  peace out

      I had quite a good time over the past weekend, and I hope everyone else did as well.  It was probably my very first 'sane' fourth, where I didn't get burned or stabbed with a PVC pipe (recalling last year when i nearly chopped my toe off with a pipe...)  At first I didn't think that I was going to do anything for the fourth, seeing as how I had/have no money, and that my parent's weren't home.  But then the neighbors got home and bought explosives and we had fun.  So today I'm going to go and take the driving test for my license (sp?).  I should do okay.  And then (the best part) we're going down to the Apple store and letting me see the pretty Macs.  I can't wait, it's gonna be sweet.    Random bits: I'm over 1000 posts @ BB in about 3 months.  Also, check  urlLink this  out, it's from  urlLink SRF.STN .  Funny as hell.  peace out :)

      Hmmm.. I've been terribly busy since last I posted.  I've worked on some more sites, which will be released soon.  And I've started production on my site.  Nothing fancy, but it's cool.    Got to talk with  urlLink Mike Minor  today.  Very great guy, super cool.  It was good to get back in touch with him.  Only $1000 away from the mac.  I should get some freelance to get there faster.  Also, new friends are listed at right.  Thanks for your support guys :)  peace out.

      So I took another trip to the Apple store Saturday.  I spent 2 hours there, and found out a lot more information regarding powermacs and their hardware.  I didn't know that there were two releases of them, a release A and release B.  The main differences between the two is that the low-end model was only a single processor, and the middle model was the dual 1.8 (which I want).  This is important because with the middle model you get more fun stuff, like an 8gb ram capacity, a 160gb hdd, and 3 pci-x slots.   A quick google on the matter produced  urlLink this :   Revision 1.0 of the PCI-X specification defined PCI-X 66 and PCI-X 133 devices that transferred data up to 133 MTS, or over 1Gbyte per second for a 64-bit device. The present revision adds two new speed grades: PCI-X 266 and PCI-X 533, offering up to 4.3 gigabytes per second of bandwidth, 32 times faster than the first generation of PCI. Another major feature of the PCI-X 2.0 specification is enhanced system reliability.  Sounds pretty cool, and I think I should investigate this more.  The only downside to the release A powermac is $200 more (for the store prices).  I think that that is a better thing to get however, because of the added features.    *Hopefully* I'm making a good decision on Apple.  It's an awful lot of money, and I could build a windows system for half as much.    One more thing:  I'm in a  urlLink battle  at BB.  It's fun ^__^  peace out :)

      First off, for all you loyal readers, I'm sorry it's been so long since I've updated.  Quite busy have I been.   Yesterday I took off work (and missed the AS conference) to go to the lake.  I had a lot of fun and spent probably eight full hours in the water.  I went sailing by myself on the little MX Ray ( urlLink click ) for the first time in a year and ooh it was sooo much fun!  I didn't capsize nearly as much as I thought I would (only 3 times near the end) considering the wind was so strong.  It was super annoying though because when I pulled the  urlLink spinnaker  the wind completely died and I drifted right into the shore near some dumb kids who were like 'Huh, what's that yellow thing Uncle Jim?'   We went out on the wooden boat for a good two hours and I burnt the tops of my knees something awful!  They really hurt but I  urlLink cbf  to put aloe on it.  Oh well, it'll heal.  It's not like I've never been burned before.   Also, I went buck-wild with my camera the other night and got some  urlLink pictures  that were pretty cool.  I used my step-dad's big-ass lantern and ran around in front of my camera on a tripod for 15 seconds.  Pretty fun blinding the neighbors at 10 o'clock p.m.   But I lost the original high-res of the ones I uploaded.  :(   One last thing - I'm in another  urlLink tennis  match @ BB.  Great fun, first time doing that sort.   Anyway, it's time to go home from work now.  Congrats to  urlLink Chris  and   urlLink David  for being so good at flash.  Props you guys.   -out

      You know that?  It really does....  grrr..  work?  i hate it.  you can't fucking imagine.  Not only am I sick of doing all these bullshit websites, I'm sick of having them picked to destruction by my boss.  But, what are boss's for, eh?  I'll be soooo happy when I get paid to be forced to change websites..  That'll be sweet.  So then enough rant.... My site is finally starting to come together.  It looks really nice, but sorry, there's no preview :P  So far I'm at 130 or so lines of AS, and there's still more to do.  Hopefully I'll be finished with it before school starts.   Ah.  School.  It starts in like 2 weeks.  As much as I want to see my friends, I really don't want to go back.  Just like every other summer, this one has whizzed by.  Fuck.  I hate work, I really do.  I love the money, but I hate the time it takes up.  grrrrr.  Maybe I could write the fucking government and they'd pay me for doing nothing.  But then again, maybe not.  Oohhhh.. it's nearly mac time!  This friday I'll have almost enough for the computer, and then after I sell some stuff I'll have enough for the mac, dual 17" LCDs that I found on eBay, and *hopefully* a desk and a light.   Bah.  I'm tired.  I'm cranky.  And, there's a big meeting on Friday that I haven't even thought about.  Grrrrrr.  Maybe I'll call in sick on Friday... yeees, that's the thing to do!  oh my, that was like one big entire bitch session.  Oh well...  sorry for not updating for so damn long.  peace out.
