      Well, i've come to the realization that without a permit I can not experience the 'true' north carolina (hehe) Angela and I spent the previous Saturday at my house trying to find rides to go places. Sadly the only place we went was to the park and our own two feet carried us there. But that is okay I dare say that I need to get out more often and it was a beautiful day. So that was my weekend besides having my lazy bum on glued to the couch while my eyes were fasincated with the many colorful pictures on the screen in front of me.   On Sunday I went to church for about an hour and than decided my 'headache' was too much for me to bear. My parents were highly disapointed in me and I was highly disapointed in my acting.   Now, on Monday, I have faced the daily challenge of school and came out of it without any rewards or further knowledge. Thank-you under-paid teachers for wasting 6 hours of my life. The only thing I found out today was that when it's cold at lunch i should join Tom and Lisa on the ground because they are most highly entertaining and block the wind.   I must admit it is very hard when you are thrown off schedule. On Saturday I thought it was Friday and started to get ready for school before my breother, while eating ice cream at 8:30 in the morning, told me that it was Saturday. Than on Sunday I thought it was Saturday and made my parents wait for me to get ready. And now today I woke up thinking it was Saturday and had a lovely argument with my father on why not to wake me up before 10. I got the impression that he enjoys making me realize that when i'm half-awake I can be quite the idiot and refuse to believe common sense.   "You better live your best and act your best and think your best today, for today is the sure preparation for tomorrow and all the other tomorrows that follow."

      Today i went to school and enjoyed the pleasure of listening to the teachers drone on about things that I had no intention of giving my attention to. I was thoroughly dissapointed when I realized that I could be at the zoo. My parents thought it was high time to take Caroline to the zoo while my grandparents were in town. I could have gone but thinking that I should go and be responsible to my studies. Though I have come to the conclusion that it was a pointless effort due to the fact that the whole day my mind was wandering to that of penguins and giraffes. I learned nothing today and it was a waste of my time.   After school I traveled to the local McDonalds with friends and had a highly entertaining conversation about their social lives. My greasy double cheeseburger has kept my food processing unit happy up till now and I don't think it will settle for anything less than something fattening. I have therefore punished it and decided to eat a celery stick.   "An intellectual is a person who has discovered something more interesting than sex."

      Well as of late I feel like I just stepped in a big turd. Oh man what can I say but life sucks. School has become the biggest pain in the ass I could ever think of. I wish I could just kind of freeze time and do things at my own pace but it doesn't exactly work that way now does it? Too bad it would help me loads. Yeah so hmmm I really don't want to go into my life right now. I don't feel good and my head feels like someone has wedged a permanet nail in there. I told some advil but it doesn't seem to want to help me. Instead it made my stomach upset. God is punishing me, see Angela I told you he would... I should have never bought it. Oh dear, well.

      Hmm, what happened today. I'm pretty sure absolutely nothing happened today. I kinda just sat in a stupor while my teachers droned on about things that I kind of ignored and blocked out of my head. Yeah, oh wait i'm sorry something did happen today, the elections! See today was the Junior class elections and this was one of the hardest elections EVER! See for class president my two good friends Alyson Zandt and Emily Morro were running... oh that was hard, ouch. And than fro Junior Class Vice President it was Angela and Andrea.... SO HARD HARD HARD... EW OW! haha... yeah well Angela threatened to kill me if i didn't vote for her *whimper* yeah and the rest didn't matter... cept Missy because she rocks!

      Today was a real drag. I don't know why it's just that nothing really seemed to fit into place. You know how when you get a brand new puzzle and you're doing it for the first time and all the pieces (dont' know how to spell that word, had to go use spellchecker, i'm such a loser) fit exactly how you want them too. But as time goes on and you keep on doing the puzzle some peices don't seem to quite fit as well. One is too, one doesn' t seem to match, the color has been worn down. Yeah well that's kind of how I feel. I wish I could just be new again...maybe i should take a bath or take a nap but nah... it doesn't seem to fit.  I had a test today in English and I don't think it went to well, it was an essay test and I didn't know much about the subject so I kinda just pretended that I did. Yeah and in Chemistry I found out I made a 53 on the test. Oh dear, nothing seems to be going quite right.  "In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous."

      Well today has been boring and going to school was a just a reminder of how I forgot to do my homework over the break. Oh joy. In Algebra2 I remembered that I haven't taken a test and I don't understand any of the information it's on, great. Yeah and in Drama I need to memorize my lines and figure out my mesurments for my costume. Blah. Yeah and in ELPS we have a big quiz on wednesday, not the greatest thing i've heard so far. Yeah and than in English we had part one of the test today, which wasn't hard because it was just multiple choice but tomorow is the essay and I don't think i'm going to do so well on that. Yep and in Chorus I need to remember lines for a song... grr, woof. Yep and in chemistry... uh, chemistry is okay nevermind.  Five weeks til the end of school! Whee! I'm so excited... except when I think of exams than i get kind of cold and start to shiver.  June 7th is OUR PARTY! WHEE! Alright... let's get started on those invitations... lol.

      Today was a good day.  My parents came home today and relieved me of the duty of baby-sitting my lovely baby sister. I was greatly rewarded though from my father with 100 dollars. Yes, and when they came home my mother decided to hold an Easter hunt. It mainly consisted of my little sister, Caroline, running around manically pointing out eggs and placing them in Nathan's outstretched shirt. Than my mother so graciously handed me my easter basket. I must say i'm thourougly pleased. Money would have been more useful but still i'm very happy.  I cleaned and sorted out my candy jars and had a joyful experience throwing out lollipops that I had no idea existed.  I'm happy and I hope you are too.

      Today in the morning Angela and I decided to do strong libs at homestarrunner.com here are the results...  Strong MadLib 1: HARD LIKE CLOTHES. I FROLICK DOWN ON THE WORLD BELOW. ALL WILL PRANCE AT MY THROAT. BEHOLD MY HOT BANANA. I AM STRONG MAD. I AM REESE WITHERSPOON.  Strong Bad Lib1: My idiot brother Jordan is such a pizza suace! When I lay him, he pays. When he loses a thong, he pays. And when I call him a pizza sauce, he pays!! I hate my idiot brother Jordan.  Strong Bad Lib2: The other day I was at a bedroom eating balls when out of nowhere came this long guy. I could tell he had serious floor problems from the get-go. His chest was all slick and stank like Angela. A pot was hanging out of his pants. He fell down in a puddle of hot choclate. I laughed my buttocks off.

      Okay, hey everyone again! I haven't been on here in awhile but i've been busy... no not really i'm just lazy.  Well, last Saturday was delightfully fun. I finally went to the zoo... first time in my life! Well, that i could remember at least. Hmm, yeah well we had a lot of fun having the zebras stick their butts at us. Us... that is Emily F, Tom Martain, and I. Yeah well it was great. And we were going to get Angela a present but sadly we coudlnt' quite fit the elephant in Emily's hair. Yeah, well the car ride up was a bunch of fun and the ride home was too we were having fun listning to music. Yeah... hmm and I was blowing bubbles into Tom's face, not on purpose but... yeah... wind was just not working with me.  Yeah well... an update on school. Hmm. Nathan has officially dropped out of school for this year. He said so this morning. This sucks. But in ELPS we has this paper due and well sadly our computer got a virus and my paper was deleted... wouldn't be such a problem if i hadn't lost the rough draft I had printed out... but i did. Yeah on Wednesday I have an essay due on a topic that I totally do not understand and will not understand for.. hmm a long time. Okay, well i'm having fun having my grades drop in my classes.. yeah right. This week is going to be really crazy at school. Well... hmm see today I only went to 4th-6th because of... issues with my back and my dad... but that's okay and than tomorow the sophmores have to take this field test in first and second and than on wednesday we have to take it in third and fourth... yeah and thursday and friday we have off...Yeah well that's about it for school... i think.

      Today was delightfully fun. And that is all you need to know.  Jen and I have come to the conclusion that teddy grahms are not as they appear, you think they are tiny harmless crackers to fill your tummy in delight. But no, they are so much more. Tomorow I am going to Jen's hut and we will be studying and videotaping the secret rituals of the teddy grahms. For some odd reason jumping jacks has found a way into their culture and we are trying to get it all on tape. Tomorow will be the day of truth for the teddy grahms...  I challenge everyone out there to follow your own dreams. I know how hard it is today in our societ to try and be someone different. We all like to mold ourselves into what society thinks is acceptable. We go throught our daily routines not challenging what we believe because we like to feel safe. If we challenge ourselves it's a risk. So instead of risking it we choose to be the typical person. Well, hmm, maybe I make no sense and you have no idea what i'm talking about so i'll put it in a more famous term... be yourself.  "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away."

      Well today was a wonderful crappy day. I did get to go to school late though which i enjoyed. In most of my classes I really didn't do much so it was a waste of my time. Well actually, chorus was quite fun. My friends and I got to draw very entertaining pictures on our poster about nationalism in the Romantic Period...hmm, they had nothing to do with them but it was fun anyways.   Today was very beautiful and I actually did my homework like yesterday. I just go outside and sit my pretty self down on our back porch and do my homework.  After dinner I wernt to church and walked two miles for a requirement I had to reach for a trek i'm doing this summer. Wow, excitement. Yes, okay well an apple is waiting for my tummy, they have a dinner date. Tata.  "Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles."

      Well just for the randomness of it, i took a quiz today about what kind of kiss i am and here it is    You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      What do you do when you feel like your failing life? I mean, when you're failing a class or something like that you can always try harder and manage to pass it. But with life how exactly do you try harder? I don't know, I bet someone out there would love to give me a lecture on how to live my life and all of that but I really don't want that. Well hmm, I dunno guess i'll see what happens.  One more week of school and i'm out! Wheee, this summer is going to rock. I can't wait to get out of the house and get away from my family.

      Well, today I had my Algebra 2 test and i think I did quite well, by that I mean I think I got an A not only and A but a 100! Ahh, but soon my hopes will be dashed to the floor when we get our tests are returned and I realize that I was wrong, dead wrong. Yeah well... I tried and that's all matters...*sigh* how depressing.   Well onto better news... um, give me a moment to think. Okay well, there is not better news just to let you know. Yeah, nothing special.

      Okay well I haven't really updated lately but you know... what would I say? The usual "oh and in this class I did this" but that kind of gets old wouldn't you think? Well what is there to say? Hmmm, I don't know. I mean school isn't really that great of a thing right now. Too many tests, people are stressing the whole end of the year exams... i mean what's up with that? Whatever... haha. Okay so maybe I'm just lazy or something like that but whatever.  My mother has called me fat. Yeah, isn't that so sweet. Okay so it wasn't really a direct statement... okay she didn't say I was fat at all but I got the intention that she was calling me that anyway. And well, if I say that she didn't say that... it wouldn't be worth mentioning in here would it now? Well anyways, I was making my lunch and I asked my mother if she had any of those yummy mints left and she looked at me and said, "Victoria you should eat healthier foods you eat too much junk" Well... if that is not implying i'm fat I don't know what is. I mean yeah... whatever i'm done.

      Okay... sorry bout that guys but i haven't posted in like FOREVER! Ahh... and too much stuff has happened meaning i have a lot to write... and I don't know if i'm really up for it. Oh well... so I come back to blogger and the site has like...completely revamped the whole site... i was like... crazy man! So I'm kinda all comfused and turned around but that's okay... it's a fresh start. So onto my summer thing a ma bob.  So anyways... after school left out my church hosted this whole trek thing. And we hiked for 4 days with handcarts and it was raining and muddy and i lost my shoes in the mud because it sucked them off and i couldn't find them and i was just kind of like who cares... but anyways... it was a lot of fun. And i would tell you WHY we did it but that's like this whole story in itself so i'll just some it up for you in a few words... i'm mormon.  Yeah so than the week after that I flew out to Utah to go to this seminar (a mormon seminar). And it was SOOO much fun. It's called EFY, Ecspecially For Youth, and it was just crazy fun. We stayed on the BYU campus and we were in these families kind of things. And we went to a bunch of classes and seminars... and we did a bunch of games and things. I met a whole bunch of people and some really hott guys... too bad i'll probally never see them again in my life and if i actually wrote them or called them (b/c i did get their addresses and numbers of course) they would probally totally be like 'who are you?' or 'why is this girl calling me?'... you know, something along those lines... but that's cool... i'm not hurt by that or anything :(      Okay... so than for the rest of the summer i've pretty much sat on my butt and have done NOTHING! Wow... cool eh? So anywho... i've caught up and i'll try and stay up with this blogger... not that anyone reads it or anything... and if you do, great for you! Yeah... so... later.

Okay... so if you don't get it, you're and idiot... and if you don't think it's funny... you're a loser for not taking pleasure in a simple joke... but anyways, there's one more that you might like  1.

      True to the title of my blog... I was looking at the road i've taken in my life. I came to the conclusion that i'm not satisfied and in a way I feel dirty. Some of the choices i've made have not kept up to my expectations that I hold for myself. I know that this world and its tempations are hard to ignore but I wished that I had a higher expectations of myself but truthfully due to some of my friends slowly those walls have crumbled. I start to compromise that if I do this it's okay because of some reason which, in truth doesn't make sense. Some of the things I really regret and feel the pressure of guilt closing in. So, i've decided that it's time that I turn back. I know that once you're down a path it's hard to turn back but I really want to. The problem is I made it all the way by myself... does that mean I have to make it back that way too? I really hope not, I hope there is someone out there that I know that will help me along the way. Is it you? If I asked you... would you help?  "The ultimate test of a relationship is to disagree but hold hands." Alexander Penney

      Okay guys... i'm totally dissapointed in Isabella... I expected so much more from her. I mean, I know it's hard to compare to a cousin with the name of Fran... but I thought she could do much better than this. I mean... the lightning and thunder was exciting for about.... the two seconds it lasted. Than, the winds were mighty cool... the best part about it. I mean, I went outside in my swimsuit later on when it was really blowing and raining and kind of just hung out outside. It was pretty cold so I started dancing to keep myself warm. I'm pretty awesome. So, than for the rest of the day I was inside drawing. I had a good time.  So... I took a typing test the other day and I got 77wpm and like a 92% accuracy. I'm pretty wowed by this. I mean... the last time I checked (6th grade) I could only type like 54... which to let you know... I was the fastest in the class! So... I think I'm pretty awesome. Haha... i'm not vain. You know... I was thinking about this. If you say you're not vain, you obviously are because only a vain person would think they're not vain. But if you say you're vain than you obviously aren't because a vain person wouldn't think they're vain. So either way, you can't win. So what to do when someone asks if you're vain. I would leave it up for them to decide I guess.... I mean, if someone has to ask you if you're vain in the first place... well, than... that's sad. (you're sad --- right megan?!)  Also on a side note... I would like to apologize to Nathan because I spelled his name wrong in my last post (which I now have fixed) I was typing and wasn't watching and I spelled it Lambe.... now let me tell you... that is not how you spell Lamb. I would have lost in a spelling bee... well I DID lose in a spelling bee, but that was a long time ago. (9th grade... JUST KIDDING. It was 5th) And also... I was not making fun of his last name... his last name rocks and mine doesn't. I bow down to the mighty last name of Nathan.  ... and a side note to Megan, we WILL watch Fido goes west and the Emperor's new groove (... what does that have to do with anything?    No, no he does have a point...) and also... we will try those cookies again... something we did just wasn't right.  Elaina Rocks.

Haha. Yeah, nice. They're all playing x-box... dorks, losers, no lifes... yeah.  Well anywho, let me tell you about today! I had detention for the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE... i mean talk about changing your out look on life. But actually... it was fun. See, at our school... detention is a new thing really so they're not too good punishing us. What i had to do was run around the school and empty the recycling bins into the larger ones outside. Which is actually pretty nasty but not when you're doing it with Catherine and Frank... they're awesome. And because the teacher let me out a minute early.... oooooooooo... yeah i'm awesome. But after that.... me and Nathan Lamb (not my brother who would be Nathan Zundel) we went down to poplar street and he taught me how to skate-board... well actually long-board and let me tell you he is the almight skate-boarding guru (is that the right word) well anyways... i was having a blast... till angela came! HAHAH I'M TOTALLY KIDDING ANGELA! But than... we were going to frolick in a field but Nathan didn't have time so we just went and hung out at halifax and had a might good time swinging... Me and Nathan (baaa baa...) won against angela and chandler in a combined effort... nathan sat on top of me... oooo! haha... yeah than i did some other stuff that's not important... b/c they almight nathan wasn't involved! hahah... actually... i did tackle him like i was a bull and than me and angela broke out in the "we are the tauros the mighty might tauros!" Yeah... today rocked!     "You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."

      Oh man guys, conflict of friends.  Just when life starts to even out... i hit the jacpot of all potholes. Nah, maybe it's not that serious. Well, I don't know... switching schools in the middle of Junior year... maybe that is pretty serious. See, i'm not sure what to do. There's a lot of reasons why I should and shouldn't do it and I don't think i'll get a good response from any of my friends because they'll be leading to the school of their choice, not knowing what the other one has to offer.  So, when life all of a sudden splits into two... both paths seeming the same at the beginning but at the end change so drastically... how are you supposed to pick and know what you've chosen is right. Unlike some paths in life... this one I can't turn around and go back, there's no shortcuts to the other one if the one I choose gets too hard. This is an all or nothing choice and i'm not sure how to handle it. I know sometimes I appear to take things a little carefree on the surface... i'm sure some of you who i've talked to about this think that I don't care, but really... this is something that i'm really being challegned over. Maybe change is good.  "The first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: Decide what you want." Ben Stein

         I would have to say that Autumn is my favorite season of all. When you go outside there's a very distinct smell that is very crisp. If I had to choice which season I would live in my entire life it would definitly be Autumn. The weather is perfect, or at least where I live, it's not too hot or cold. It's the right time to go down to the beach and just have an all out blast of fun. The season is just full of vibrant colors and the sky always looks so perfect. Sometimes I wish I could just fly up into it and never come down, I think Angela knows what i'm talking about.  These are the perfect days just to go outside and run in a field. I'm hoping i'll do that this saturday. Yeah, i'll get Angela to go with me... or Megan. We'll go down to pullen park for the day and do the paddle boats, the train, the merry-go-round. Yeah, i'm hoping this will work. Anyone who wants to come let's do it! Let's be spontaneous... well I don't know how spontaneous you can be when you plan something the Sunday before-hand.... but hey, you know what... it's OKAY! Alright this is going to be great... i'm excited! YEAH!  "It was one of those perfect English autumnal days which occur more frequently in memory than in life." P. D. James

      Today was a good day, it was pretty outside and I spent the day with my very good friend megan. I went over to her house and picked her up and we drove down to chargrill and goodberry's. We sat outside munching on our delicious sandwiched and lime rickey's. As i sat there it was like everything was going to be okay and it felt great. Than we went home and made cookies and that was interesting... delicious too. But than we hung out and did an assortment of things. Watched 3/4ths of Aladdin because we didn't really feel like rewinding it. Than we did some stuff on the computer. I'd have to say the most fun was watching little rascals and playing pool. Yeah, good times man, good times.  Right as I was leaving Josh, her brother, was walking into his room and I was inspired to do something evil... or funny. I said "Hey Josh, I'd be careful when you pull down your covers tonight!" It was really entertaining watching Josh go through all his bed sheets looking for something before realizing that it was a joke.

      I would just like to say that I envy all you people out there that have really good mother-daughter realationships. I think that is so great that you guys do the whole mother-daughter movie nights or dinners. Or even if you don't do that but you and your mom are on at least good speaking terms and understand each other. See, I don't have that, i've never had that and I don't think I ever will. But you see, now at this point in my life I don't think I could accept it if it was offered to me. See ever since I was a kid my mother has ignored me. Not like you might think... oh yeah she came to all my concerts and helped me on my homework. She put on a great facade... she even fooled me for awhile. But no matter what I did I could never measure up to how great my sister was. See, my sister and mom had that great 'connection' that some parents have with their kids... I don't know, maybe i'm not capable of that, maybe it's my fault but I don't think i'll ever know. Even when my mom and sister did include me in those things I was still never really included. When we walked I was always behind, the conversations were too grown-up for me... so finally I just stopped accepting their offers and than they stopped offering them.   As I sit here and think about this, maybe I wouldn't be so hurt if my mom truly knew what my sister was like. You see my sister was a great deceiver of all sorts. My mom thought she was little miss perfect... that she never did anything wrong. But I saw it all, I knew of everything she did but I never told... I always kept it to myself, afterall... it wasn't my place to tell. But if I ever did anything wrong, which compared to her deeds was nothing more than a simple slip up in the path of my life, but she would always tell and I would get in trouble. Still, I never told though. But because of this I slowly started to feel contempt for my sister, I tried hard to get along but we are so different. Everything I did in my sister's eyes was considered childish, immature, or stupid. She would always compare me to herself and how I should become more like her. And because I hated my sister my mother hated me.  My life, most would say has been pretty easy and I won't disagree. Compared to others life styles I know that I'm blessed with things they can't even comprehend but still... I think I would give up most everything I have just to have a good relationship with a mother I could love. See, where most people had somebody to lean on in the most trying times of their life I had nobody. I thought I could depend on a friend but in the end even that ended in disaster. She hurt me really badly and I don't think i'll ever really recover from that. Because of her and some others I have a hard time trusting people, i've learned through those experiences that trust in itself is deceitful.   But that's not to say I haven't recovered. In the past three years I have met some of the most wonderful people ever. I could never find better friends than them. They mean so much to me and have helped me a lot. I'm sure they don't know it and probally could never truly understand what they mean to me. But I would just like to let them know that they are my world and without them I would be nothing. These people might not even be my best friend either... they are just people that give me an encouraging word when i'm feeling down. Or when i'm not having a bad day they don't ask about it but instead give me a smile and a funny story. These people mean everything to me and I hope that they understand they have changed my life and I love them forever for that.   "Don't walk behind me, I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend." Albert Camus (1913 - 1960) (attributed)

      The randomness of my brain just totally surprises me. When i think that i've gone to my limits... out POPS something else. See, I was sitting around with some buddies of mine and it was entirely way too quiet for my liking and so on the spot I started singing this song... now considered Megan W.'s favorite song  I have a banana it's in my bed, I sleep with it everynight under my head And when I wake up in the middle of the night, I shake to the left and I shake to the right And than me and the banana fight fight fight, and if I win I take a big bite!  I'm sure there's more to come but as of right now that's all... have me sing it for you.

I might have added some stuff in but that's what I got from it.

I find out that Nathan (my brother) brings over his two friends Taylor and Josh and decide that they would burn my skateboard. Well gee guys, thanks! I mean, i've always wanted to have my property burned. I mean, why should I care! Oh... I cannot express to you how angry I am right now. If any one of those 3 people came up to me right I would take my burned skateboard and hit them REALLY hard... (haha that sounds funny)  "Insane people are always sure that they are fine.

      Wow Guys, for being on the internet so much I sure have a hard time updating this thing... I was really into it and everything but i've been slacking off! I have to fix this! I must get more motivated... alright Tori.... you can do this!  Well anywho... today started off really bad because I slept into 7:30 and I skipped seminary. Now most of you are like.... "why would she be unhappy about not getting up at 6 in the morning and going to a bible class?" Well guys, I figured that when I go to seminary my day is actually a lot better than when I don't. Also, I really like learning about the bible stories and such... and also, they're really hott guys in my class (yeah, we all know now why Tori goes to seminary) As the day progressed... everything got better, so yeah... today was alright.  Well, when I got home Megan told me the most HALARIOUS story about her brother... you should go to her blog and read it. Maybe you'd have to understand her brother to understand why it's funny... but, it's still a pretty interesting story...( right megan 2:20a.m... that would kill me) I also found out he still plays his game boy occasionally.... oh we're all dorks on the inside. Well, except Angela... she's more of a emu, and well.. i'm more of a cow wrangler.  "He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare, And he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere."

      Hey guys... it's been a long time since i've been on here... whoops! Oh well, life kind of gets in the way. But anyways, nothing speical has been going on except I got a 100 on my math test! WOO! You don't now how exciting that is... well... megan does because math for me is biology for megan. Me and megan are two of a kind... or not.  Guys, I think there's something wrong with me. I can't stop sleeping! At first I was like oh it's because i've been staying up late and getting up early in the morning. But for about 3-4 weeks i've been going to bed around 10-10:30 and than I get up around 6. The thing is... I come home and take a 2-3 hour nap! It's crazy... I mean if it wasn't EVERY day I wouldn't be so worried. And than... even when i take naps i'm already tired by 8! I dont' know... maybe i'm going through a growth spurt or something... i hope not!  So, i'm trying to think about what's going on in my life. Alias and charmed have started up again and i'm SOOO happy. I have re-instated my regular sunday nights and Jennifer's couch, eating good food and wonderful ice cream.   Yes  urlLink Megan ... Zero (from holes) IS a cuttie.... woo and that last scene... yowsers... hahah.  Today, we didn't have school which lucky me.... I was sick. I missed Jennifer's party! Ahh, i feel so bad about that. But than my mom dragged me shopping and I was like all blotchy and hideous... ew. I ended up getting a lot of stuff though which i'm happy about! I rock... haha... yeah. Wow, life is okay again... I'd like to thank God for that.   "The worst moment for the atheist is when he is really thankful and has nobody to thank." Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828 - 1882)

      I'm only posting because I feel like I have to keep this good blogging up. You know... good luck, or some type of shit like that.   I hate how in shows they ALWAYS leave you off to make sure you tune in to next week's program. Grr on them, I don't like cliffhangers... i'd tune in anyways without the drama. Alias... you're going to kill me with suspense one of these days.  Today was kind of iffish... i'm not sure what to think of it and I don't know if I really care too much.   Rant of Today  Why do people say I could care less? If you really think about this, it doesn't make sense whatsoever.  You see, people tend to say this when they don't care at all. For example... when Jordan asks me if I want to hear about how some kid stuffed a frog in their pants at school... I tell him I could care less... when in reality I don't care at all.  See, when you say that phrase, "I could care less", you're implying that you cared in the first place. To care LESS means that something has to be there to detract from it. Now, you could say, 'what about negatives?'... but in this sense to have negative caring means you would have to hate it... and when we say I could care less... we don't hate (or discriminate) we just truly don't care.   So from now on when you say "I could care less".... ask yourself did you care in the first place?

      Today was really boring. All I did was work. Oh geez... I think I have no life on saturdays. It would help if I had a boyfriend to do stuff with. But woe is me, it doesn't look like THAT is going to be happening anytime soon.   I probally should've done my homework but sadly I don't think that happened today.   Man, Megan... I spent a long time on adjusting that thing for you. You best appreciate... haha. Grr, no i'm serious.... you make me mad and i'll revoke your privelages of that thing. No joke. Grr.. woof!  Alright... I'll try to update with something more interesting tomorow. Later guys!

      TONIGHT ROCKED! I must say Angela and Tom are two of the most fun people to do random stuff with. We had this plan to go to this garden place and that totally never happened. But anyways, here is what happened...  Angela picked me up at the school parking lot because I don't like driving downtown and we headed over to Tom's house. After we all got into Tom's car we drove downtown for a bit and ended up parking at Moore's Park (I think.. something like that) We then proceeded to hang out in city market with NOBODY there. I mean, it was DESERTED! So we just proceeded to walk around downtown doing nothing in particular. Then we went to the mall with NOBODY there.. again! So we just sat on the empty fountain and talked about guys... well... girls for Tom. Then we went over to ANOTHER fountain and hung out in that one too. After that we decided we wanted to do something else and went back to his car. On the way I was having fun dancing in the middle of the road. I mean, no cars were coming so I just was dancing and twirling... great fun.  After we got in the car Angela and I were having fun yelling at the windows. Tom has this really cool thing that if you yell up/down at the windows they respond. Well... we were trying to confuse the windows by yelling them at the same time. We were also yelling silly words like DOWNtown.   Krispy Kreme is great. I mean, REALLY great! We went there afterwards and we just got some doughnuts and milk and ate them. Go figure. Their bathrooms have really funny sinks though. I mean, they're itty bitty!  After doughnuts we headed out to a park. We were having great fun swinging in the swings. First Tome and I got married and then divorced with no kids. Then Angela and Tom were married and had a kid named Augustus... i'm not sure if we ever decided it was a boy or a girl? Then me and Angela were married... that did not last long. After the swings we ran over to this HUGE hill and rolled down it a couple of times. Angela and I were continuously crossing paths for some odd reason but never ran into each other. After we were done rolling we decided it would be fun to lay on Tom. So Tom for awhile had us laying on him... he's a very comfortable pillow and it's hilarious laying on his tummy when he laughs. Well then we got the grand idea to go streaking. So me and Angela take our shirts off and run around the field in our bras. I'm so glad tonight was warm because it felt so good with the wind against my skin. Then Tom takes off his shirt and runs around. It seemed like he was a little more conscious about it then me and Angela. Well... then we decided taking our shirts off just wasn't enough. So we rip off our pants and decide to run around the field with only our undies on. Tom was just so hilarious in his boxers. This kid is so much fun! So we finally begrudgingly put our clothes back on again, roll down the hill one more time and leave.  Today was the best day i've had in forever. Thank-you friends, you are fantabulous.     I love the swings. Angela and Tom have reunited my love for them.

      Becca came over today and we had a lot of fun. So right when Becca starts driving over Melissa calls and says we need to go to the Shrine club to do prom things. Well... so I made Becca tag along. When we got there it wasn't too exciting. A few good laughs but other then that it was just you know... prom committee. Afterwards me and becca were hungry and so we decided to go out to eat so Melissa and Elaina tagged along. It was fun sitting at Chargrill eating burgers and talking about really funny things. After that we went to goodberry's for complimentary ice cream. Then we decided we still hadn't had enough of each other and all went over to my house to watch a movie. Actually Melissa and Elaina and to go pick up a book? So me and Becca went and rented Steel Magnolias.   Eventually all of us got to my house with the movie. I LOVE Steel Magnolias. It's my favorite movie and Melissa's too. So after the movie we all sat in my dad's office and talked about... once again... really halarious things. Afterwards Elaina and Melissa left and eventually Becca too.   So i've been meaning to dye my hair for sometime now and tonight I did it. Now if you don't remember what my hair looked like before go to the pictures blog that I have but here's a picture of my new hair. Ignore how bad the picutre is because I defintly look bad. I also look kind of stuck up but I was having a difficult time taking a picture of myself. My smile looked stupid and my hair wasn't showing up if I stared straight forward. Eh, still turned out bad but i'm sick of unloading the camera.    It's kind of hard to tell a difference on this picture... but in person... it's REALLY different. Yes, I rock. I love it.

      Today was an interesting day. I went to school and everything was very fun. At 1:30 I had to go to the dentist (I hate dentists *shiver*) Yeah and everything checked out OKAY! I just need to floss more. You know sometimes I think they just like to say that. Because the last time I was there I flossed about 3 to 4 times a week and they still told me that I needed to floss. And this time they were like... At least floss once a week. I think it's just something they have to say.   Well... Because I went to the dentist... My school day is supposed to be over. WRONG! I had to come back to school for prom committee.  It was kind of fun... not the best prom committee but it was alright.  Then I went home.  At home me and Elaina decided that we would go to the basketball game tonight to make fun of the players because our team really sucks... like REALLY sucks (no offense guys... I love you!) Well... we drive there and we sit down on the opposite team benches so we could make fun of our team without our school mates getting mad at us. David then decideds he going to join us and harass me the whole entire time. (stupid boy) Yeah, we were losing alright. And man oh man... we got to make fun of the OTHER team too! Not something we were expecting but it was really good. I think David was embarrssed to be sitting by us... but why didn't he leave? Loser. Well after that Elaina, Florian, David and I all go to Krispy Kreme during half time. Man... that was fun having florian in the back of my truck and me running over the curbs. Yeah... I'm a good driver, I swear. Well after that we went back to the game. While we were walking in david kept on sticking his cold hands on me... not fun. Funny... but not fun. Then we went back into the game and to our surprise.. WE WERE WINNING! LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ME AND ELAINA ARENT' THERE! Then the game ended and we had won... how dissapointing.  Afterwards me and Elaina had the most halarious time watching me roll around on the ground and pushing each other into the bushes. Then I threw my keys which I thought were her keys and they broke. Not good because that was my unlock thingy ma jiggy. So I try to unlock the car with the key and the alarm goes off. I can't turn it off and i'm getting frusturated with Elaina's laughing... not really because I was laughing too. Finally I just jam the key in and turn it and to my surprise it works. Go figure.

      Okay guys... I had this fantabulous entry about Courtney and my computer cancelled it out... that's it i'm going to retry and create that sucker. Just wait Courtney... you'll get your moment in my blog... HERE WE GO!  Okay guys, I'm going to tell you about my utterly cool friend Courtney Melvin. Courtney Mevin... who for the sake of that it's difficult for me to type Courtney I will be calling her Melvin. Well anywas, I don't know why but all of a sudden Melvin's greatness has come to my attention. I guess it was after school today when I was talking to her about Cane toads (Yes... cane toads.... OH NO.. THE JAWS MUSIC, ERIC SAVE ME!) We were talking and having halarious moments and she just totally rocks. Now guys, to show you how utterly cool Melvin is i'm going to give her points on her personality and such. Well to start it off... Melvin is like one of the 15 blacks kids at our school and well... that TOTALLY brings her score up to twenty thousand already. Then... the fact that she is a COOL black kid that adds about eighty thousand. Now... I'm not sure if Melvin reads my blog... so I don't know why i'm typing this... but that totally detracts from her score... not that this is a very cool blog... so it won't take away much. Now Melvin is part of the SSS club and that... right there... TOTALLY adds a gazillion points to her score... i mean... man is she COOL! Well now also Melvin is very smart but halariously funny and utterly cool... so i'll give her three thousand for he smartness and five thosand for the halariousness and seven thousand for the utter coolness. Now Melvin is also very gorgeous... like supermodel goreous so i'll give her six thosand for that and we'll throw in a thosand for pearly whites. Now... Melvin has an AMAZING sense of fashion so i'll give her like another twenty thosand for that. Well.. now that we've gotten everything, let's add this all up. Okay... so i've calculated the score and the final is...... ZERO! CONGRATULATIONS COURTN...oh wait, um, I think I added that up wrong....let me go check... -37? the squareroot of pi? uh... no no no! all wrong... um .. IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE COURTNEY BEATS ALL OF YOU SUCKERS.. HAHAHAHA! TAKE THAT! Courtney RULES! Everyone should bow down to courtney... seriously... she'll hurt you!  Well guys.. if you'd like me to score you, that's too bad because only Courtney is cool enough for this kind of thing. And if you don't agree with me on this... I think i'll get my alias face on and i'll grab a couple of buddies to take you down.

      Today was a pretty good day. Not too much happened but it was realtively laid back and I liked that.   After church today I went with Tyler, Josh, Jonathon, Jack, Black, Scott and Alex to this nursing home. It was so funny. There was this really old guy named Joe who said the craziest things. He was so funny. All the guys were cracking up and Tyelr was practically on the floor rolling around. All those people were so nice! Then Alex played the piano but got frusturated and stopped. The residents were kind of dissapointed so as a parting gift I sang... I did horrible but they all clapped politely. I guess maybe they can't hear me anyways.  Later I went over to Angela's to work on that project and we got half of it done. Not so great guys... not so great. Well anyways.... then I came home and watched Alias...and we all know what alias does to me....    Other things make me this happy too... but mainly Alias.

      You know what I figured out today? Life is too funny. Angela tends to make me realize these things... other people too, but Angela in particular. Seriously, I hear about all these things in people's lifes that seem so dramatic and tragic and I can't help but laugh on the inside. Seriously, in two days everything will be forgotten and it was all work out. Now i'm sure that this is the same with my life too. In fact, I know I make things more seriously then they ought to be and when I look back at things I do laugh. Ahh, if only I could see how silly things are when they're acutally happening... not two months later.  Today was a great day guys. I woke up and turned around and there was... BECCA! It totally freaked me out becuase I had forgotten that she stayed the night. So we were laughing about that and then she left and Angela came over for a bit. Then we went to her house to work on a project but first we cleaned her room and then realized we were hungry. So we go to chick-fil-a and order our food. We have to go back to the counter about 5 times because we kept on forgetting stuff (knives, catsup, salad dressing, croutons, sunflower seeds....) So we had an interesting conversation. Then we went back to her house and attempted to work on the project... didn't work. So we went back to my house and watched Kung Pow! That movie will always be funny no matter how many times I watch it.   Life is good right now. I seriously think just looking back at somethings I'm not too worried about what's going to happen. I can't control how my life is flowing so I'm just going to hop in my boat and go with it. Now I just need to find a damn paddle?    "Call me Betty"

      Angela... you are a great friend. And i'm so glad that we get along so great. True, it is kind of freaky how we have some of the same interests and we can read each other's minds... but that's okay. But anyways, I dont' know what I'd do without her crazziness. I mean, who would I roll down the halls with and sing music at the top of our lungs without caring. Who else would watch me fall on my ass and laugh at me (robbie might). Well... Angela... thanks for being my best friend. You too Becca, Megan, Andrea, Elaina (haha), Courtney, and Emily. All of you rock my socks.

      Causing conflict pain is never an easy thing. Nobody wants to do it but inadvertently causes it anyways. Sometimes avoiding it only causes it to come quicker and strike harder. I really hope that someday I can look back on the pain that I've caused and realize that at least I tried to make it better. I don't know if that will happen nor do I know when in my life is a good time to stop and look back. If I stop and look back now I'm afraid I might break down and weep realizing the hurt that I've caused over such trivial things.   I want you to know that your happiness means the world to me. Paying attention to what I want and feel gets you nowhere and will end getting you entangled in a mess you can't get out of. Don't ask for my help because my help will not be even and I'll try and tip the scale. I hope you find what you're looking for and everything works out. If not, I'm sorry and I'm here for you as a friend. I'm not asking for anymore then that, because in reality... I don't even deserve that.

      People are so retarted sometimes.  Tarot cards are pretty cool although the reason why they work is because the readings are so broad. I can understand why people like to believe in them.   Life is slowly slipping down the drain and i'm not sure how much longer I can hold on. Maybe a vibrating chair would help the situation.     My life is rated PG-13.  What is your life rated?    Oh and by the way... i added more pictures into my photo section for you dudes and dudettes that like to look at me. *wink*

      There's somethin' 'bout the way You look tonight There's somethin' 'bout the way that I can't take my eyes off you  There's somethin' 'bout the way your lips invite Maybe it's the way that I get nervous when you're around  And I want you to be mine And if you need a reason why  It's in the way that you move me And the way that you tease me That way that I want you tonight  It's the way that you hold me And the way that you know me And when I can't find the right words to say  You feel it in the way Oh, feel it in the way  Somethin' 'bout how you stay on my mind There's somethin' 'bout the way that I whisper your name when I'm asleep, oh, girl Maybe it's the look you get in your eyes Oh, baby, it's the way that it makes me feel to see you smile And the reasons they may change But what I'm feelin' stays the same  I can't put my fingers on just what it is that make me Love you, you, baby So don't ask me to decribe I get all choked up inside Just thinkin' 'bout the way  Clay Aiken rocks my world guys... seriously! I want to marry his voice. Man, if that boy sang to me I would jump in his bed... er, i mean arms... right then and there.

      Okay, I was going to put up one of my deep thought things tonight... but wow, that's not happening because i'm not really in a thoughtful or depressed state at the current moment.  So today... what happened today. Nothing too interesting in school. But after school me and Angela hung out like we always do. We really didn't do anything except avoid homework. Then we had to go to Baroque night and sing... that did not go well. It was really nice for everyone to compliment us when they know we sucked. And the whole entire night me and David were having some PRETTY interesting conversations. Then afterwards we went out to the parking lot and David's car was leaking something but he totally ignored Angela when she tried to tell him so... he doesn't know. Angela hopes it was the break fluid. After that Angela, Jeremy (really cool kid) and I went down to Kripsy Kreme and got doughnuts. Well... Angela and I did... Jeromey said he was afraid of them so he wouldn't get near them. (lies... all lies) Then I went home and got on here... exciting!   by the way... Jeremy, We WILL find out.... it's me and Angela's job to know these things.

      Okay guys... today was quite boring. And i'd like to tell you guys there is nothing wrong me. So some of my writings are a bit depressing...please lay off...i'm perfectly fine. When something major in my life comes up the people who read this blog will be second to know (first is Angela... my top priority!)  Well today I was getting quite frusturated about this virus thing that kept appearing on my AOL profile. Well... I don't know what I did... but it's gone. I'll tell you what I remember doing.  1. Changing my profile to "damn this is annoying" 2. Completely exited out of AIM 3. Went to task manager and looked through my processes for b.exe... the virus. Never found it. 4. Went to some virus search thing and ran it but it found no viruses 5. Said "screw this piece of shit" and stopped the scan 6. Signed on and it was gone.  So... if you follow these rules maybe it will go away! Heaven knows why but hey... it worked for me. I think it was thie "screw this piece of shit" that scared it off.

      I just don't care anymore. I'm sitting on the edge as it's crumbling all around me and I have the time to move but I just don't care. Piece by piece theledge is falling and inch by inch I'm getting closer to dying. I see the rocks falling to their doom and part of me screams to move but the other part of me wonders what it would be like to fall? What would it be like to just let everything go. My body starts to lean and my eyes begin to close. I'm ready to let go.   But then I hear something "Wait"  Wait? For What? I hear this simple word and stop. I sit back and open my eyes, I look to the left and to the right but nothings there. It must have been my imagination. I sigh and begin to close my eyes again but once again a voice stops me,  "Don't go" I open my eyes and turn around.  And there it is... A hand. It's reaching out to me. I look up to the face that claims the hand, but it's not just one. There's so many faces that belong to that hand. All of them are telling me to "Wait, don't go"  Now the choice is mine, to grab on... or let go.

      Okay... so I had this really nice descriptive long post about how what happened after school but because I accidentally pressed back... it all got erased and I'm really too lazy to actually type it again so I'll just make a list...  Got home and went upstairs to my room  Leaves are on my bed  I become confused  Ask my mom and she just shrugs  I get angry because shrugging means she did it  Start yelling at mother  Mother asks, "Did you leave your windows open?"  Shuts up because she's right  Go into room to shut windows but blinds are down  Opens blinds and there is a huge bug on the window  Screams  Runs and gets swatter and runs back into room  Closes eyes and smacks randomly  Bug twitches and dies  Yells ew a lot as I'm trying to pick up bug with swatter  puts in toilet and flushes  Yeah, it was pretty funny and I've realized I'm more girly then I thought I was... don't tell anyone I told you though.

      Have you ever woken up one day and realized something about yourself. Something you wish you hadn't, a dark secret that nobody knows. But instead of changing it, you lock it away and ponder over it late into the night, when no one is there to watch you cry, nobody is there to comfort you, to hold you, to say to you it will be all right. Sometimes you just feel like giving up. Sometimes you just want to crawl up in the bed and have everything disappear, you wish that everyone would forget you. But instead of doing that, you wake up every morning and put on the same mask that you always wear. The mask you wore the day before. The mask that everyone thinks is you and only you know what's truly hidden beneath it. Sometimes, some of us have multiple masks. And certain people, people you think you can trust. You let them under one of them, maybe even two. But you never let them see what's underneath the last one, the one that is actually you. Who would want to see it? Would they gasp in horror and realize the monster that is actually you? Or would they not be impressed? Would they care?   Who are we to say? Some of us have worn these masks for so long, we don't even take them off at night. We don't wash off the mask, because we don't want to. We don't want to remember who we are. We like our masks, they're pretty, they're beautiful, intelligent, talented, they're everything we wish we could be. The masks are everything, but we aren't. But one day, a small crack will appear. A crack in the mask, but just a small one. One that most of us wouldn't even notice. It doesn't take much to crack the mask, it's not hard. A comment, a gesture, a friend. Not many know what makes the crack appear, but soon more and more will come. They always do. Some might be able to stop it, patch it up, hide it. But others won't think much of them. The cracks will keep on growing larger, bigger, longer. And than, when you least expect it, the mask breaks. It could be anywhere. At school, at home, or when you're all alone. The mask will fall, and you will be revealed. For nobody can hide forever.

      Wow today was fun. I just love being talkative. I think I talked to just about everyone today, seriously. It's really interesting making conversation with people you don't even know. It's even better when they talk back. So, today I seriously would talk none stop without breathing... I almost died... I swear!  I think I make life too complicated. One day i'm just going to let everything go and not care anymore. It would probally be for the best if I let go of the past and embraced the future. Afterall, who knows what i'll find when I turn the corner. I'm hoping that if I close my eyes and trust fate, when I turn that corner the guy that i've always wanted will bump into me. Then when I open my eyes and look at him there will be this instant connection and i'll fall madly in love.  Yeah, I think this will happen if I let go.... so here I go... i'm letting go and trusting fate. Hopefully I won't fall.

      Feel like your a doll? Ever feel like you have a plastic face that can show no emotion? Feel like someone paints on your emotions and controls ever motion that you make? Do they dress you, feed you, plan out your life. Are you the puppet and the strings connect you to the puppet master? I am a doll. I don't feel pain, sorry, happiness, love, joy. These are the emotions the puppet master let's me borrow to play out the scene. She gave me love when the man of my life walks in. But as soon as that happens she takes that away and gives me anger for something that he has done... or is it something that the puppet master made him do. Then it always ends up with me being sad and the puppet master makes the man walk away with the flowers laying forgotten on the floor. Wherever I go... she follows... she has the strings, she carries my heart in her hands. I must do what she says because if I don't she'll tell them... She'll tell everyone that I'm just a doll. She'll let them see who I am... she'll take away the pretty clothes, she'll take away the plastic face, she'll take it all away and cut the strings. Than I'll fall, I'll fall for a long time, fall forever it will seem. But then sometime I'll hit the ground and everything will break.   So for now, I must listen to the puppet master and obey her will. She taunts me. She rebukes me. She makes my life a living nightmare. She is always there and I must never let her know what I truly think. I must never tell her that I know what she is doing. I see the strings and I so desperately want to cut them. But I always forget... she makes me forget, she sometimes finds out that I know, so she makes me forget. She instead puts things into my heads, thoughts that aren't mine. She makes me believe things that I don't want to believe. I'm her toy, that's all. She can just press the reset button and it's all over... I have to start all over... so she must never know when I remember, she must NEVER know. She must always think that she has control. She must never know...never know... always believe... but never know. She's doing it again... thoughts that aren't mine I hate this...she's doing it to me... I'm forgetting again...    That was something I wrote. Unlike the things I've previously written that does not describe a personal situation. I just wrote it when I was feeling down. Don't worry about me.  Sometimes you can find quotes that hit home really hard. I hate those moments. "It is easier to exclude harmful passions than to rule them, and to deny them admittance than to control them after they have been admitted." Seneca (5 BC - 65 AD)

      Can anyone out there say that they truly have friends? I mean in reality do you have the friends that you truly need? I think there are a few who are blessed with friends that would do anything for them. While there is the majority of us who don't. You might try and fool yourself into believing that you do, saying in your mind that no matter what, your friends will always be there for you. But have you ever thought what would happen in the end? Would your friend actually sacrifice themselves over you? Or would they just care for themselves and only that alone.   Your friends say they will always be there for you, but where are they when you're on the edge, when you're toeing the line of insanity and reality. Do they dare try and help you? Do they reach they're arms out and say take my hand? How can they? To do that they'd have to come out of their secure boxes, their way of living, they have to change themselves to save you. They have to step out of their stable world and into yours. To save you they have to look inside you. Not just the outside, not just the underlying layer. They have to dig deeper, further, they have to reach into the core. They have to touch your core to understand, to see, to feel who and what you are. But who wants to do that? That's too dangerous. Who would actually risk doing that for you? Because reaching into the core means risking falling in, and who knows what will happen than. If you fall into someone how can you escape? Is there an escape? Is it possible? Not many know because not many will risk it. We're all selfish, we want and never give. If you're friend was toeing the line, what would you do? Would you even know? There are so many out there who step on that thin line everyday. They see both sides, they understand what's on one side and what's on the other. And they know which is easier. They know that insanity can bring them relief, and a sense of happiness. They know that insanity is a whole different realm of ideas and thoughts. People who are insane leave their bodies behind. They escape into a new world. But at a price. And the price is insanely high. It usually ends up hurting the ones you love. Nobody wants to do that. Nobody. So that's why they toe this line. They are sane enough to realize that the price is not worth it. The price is just too high. So instead they toe the line. They experience enough of it just to keep on going. But when somebody toes the line for too long they go to far.   So do you know who is toeing the line? Do you ever actually stop to look and listen. To observe those around you. It could be your closet friend, or your worst enemy. It could be your father, mother, brother, sister. It could be the children you tend for, your teacher, your lover. It could even be you. Or maybe, you know somebody who toed the line for too long and couldn't take it. And you know the consequences. Do you ever stop to think and wonder... you could've helped? Or did you try and help but didn't try hard enough. If you would've known... would've you gone all the way to save them. Touched their core... gone to the line of insanity to bring them back? Or is the risk too high? Some of you might ask me how can I accuse them of such things? Well, I can because I have experienced both sides to the story. I have toed the line of insanity but nobody was there to help me. I had to fight the urge to take the jump, to plummet into the other world. I had to save myself and it was no easy task. I had nobody to urge me on, I had no help. But I have helped. I helped a friend when she was in need. Because I observed, I saw what was happening. And I helped. But I do not judge you, or criticize you. I only warn you. Look with open eyes and an open mind. Help when you can. Do what you can. Go to the line of insanity if you must. Because sometimes just realizing isn't enough.

It'll will be great. I have so many fun pictures to add. And if you're a friend and you don't want one up there... too bad, maybe i'll censor your face if you ask politely!

      Okay, I said i'd post three times and i'm going to hold to that promise. So here is my third post guys. Not that anyone really reads this blog too much... oh well. So today I stayed home and did nothing. I did figure out that Joe Black is a horrible movie and i'm glad that I spent no money on it what so ever. Didn't see it in the movies and I didn't rent it. Good job Tori, it was about the worst movie ever. Actually, A Walk to Remember was a pretty horrible movie. I'm not sure which one takes the cake. Oh well. So tonight Alias is on... i'm excited.     This is me right before Alias.

      Saturday: So on Saturday I woke up and I went downstairs and watched tv with Jordan. Man was Pokemon exciting or WHAT!? I don't get that show but that's okay because i'm not sure if I want to. Than around 1:00 I went down to the theatre and tried out for Little Women and I made call backs on next Saturday. *pat on the back* Than while I was sitting there waiting, this lady that works with a modeling company was trying out and she spotted me and gave me all this information. I might be on a wrigley's commercial. Haha. So than after that around 5:00 Angela showed up and we sat in my bathroom as I cleaned out my make-up drawer. Real entertaining. Than at 6:00 we had to go get help on Laudamus Te for chorus class. Then I came home and at 7:30 Lee picked me up and we went and saw Brother Bear. Good movie guys, you should go see it. Then he taught me how to drive a manual. It was fun. He said I did better then Angela. (hahah, take that Angela).

      Ahh, I missed two days guys! TWO DAYS! Okay... well today i'm going to update 3 times to make up for it! So the last two days went like this...  Friday: At school we had a flex day (which is a day where we do two activities for the whole day) the first thing I did was listen to Civil War music. So boring. But I had Angela, Eric, Dane, and Andrea with me... so it was really funny listening to Andrea laugh in pain. Than the next thing we did was walk down to the History museum. We passed a hot dog stand on the way, so Angela, Andrea and I stopped and got a bottle of water. Than Angela had to go and do school buissness and ask if he'd be willing to sell hot dogs on Tuesday at our school (loser). So, we lost our group and to our dismay we found it. Than we just went around in the museum and listened to this guy tell us things about the Civil War. Then me and Eric found out that I can make this REALLY funny face, it was great.   Afterwards I had to hang out with prom comittee to listen to a band. Didn't work out. But before hand some of us, Emily, Eric, Courtney, and me, went to starbucks and that got some stuff to drink. Then after the band thing we all went down to the mall and we had by this time picked up Mike (andrea's boyfriend). So we all went down to the mall to look for a shirt for Courtney to wear to the 80's dance. After we found her a shirt we went back to Emily's and got dressed. It was so much fun trying to learn the moonwalk and the worm. (didn't work) Than Eric was in the most halarious outfit... I about died laughing. Half of the dance was fun. The other half my leg cramped up and I could only sit down. No fun.  I'll tell you about Saturday in another post.... but for the meantime... here is a cool winter picture... this makes me happy winter is coming!

      Have you ever woken up one day and realized something about yourself. Something you wish you hadn't, a dark secret that nobody knows. But instead of changing it, you lock it away and ponder over it late into the night, when no one is there to watch you cry, nobody is there to comfort you, to hold you, to say to you it will be all right. Sometimes you just feel like giving up. Sometimes you just want to crawl up in the bed and have everything disappear, you wish that everyone would forget you. But instead of doing that, you wake up every morning and put on the same mask that you always wear. The mask you wore the day before. The mask that everyone thinks is you and only you know what's truly hidden beneath it. Sometimes, some of us have multiple masks. And certain people, people you think you can trust. You let them under one of them, maybe even two. But you never let them see what's underneath the last one, the one that is actually you. Who would want to see it? Would they gasp in horror and realize the monster that is actually you? Or would they not be impressed? Would they care? Who are we to say? Some of us have worn these masks for so long, we don't even take them off at night. We don't wash off the mask, because we don't want to. We don't want to remember who we are. We like our masks, they're pretty, they're beautiful, intelligent, talented, they're everything we wish we could be. The masks are everything, but we aren't. But one day, a small crack will appear. A crack in the mask, but just a small one. One that most of us wouldn't even notice. It doesn't take much to crack the mask, it's not hard. A comment, a gesture, a friend. Not many know what makes the crack appear, but soon more and more will come. They always do. Some might be able to stop it, patch it up, hide it. But others won't think much of them. The cracks will keep on growing larger, bigger, longer. And than, when you least expect it, the mask breaks. It could be anywhere. At school, at home, or when you're all alone. The mask will fall, and you will be revealed. For nobody can hide forever.

      Have you ever wished that you had an escape from life? Ever wanted to take an ordinary marker and draw a door to another world? A world where every dark desire of yours can come true? What if I was to tell you that I have found a doorway. I have found a window, an escape from the grays of this world. I have found colors that none have any other seen I have found worlds that others cannot imagine! Some would look on with full interest and wonder how I did it. Some would turn their heads and say impossible but out of the corner of their eye they still watch, hoping it could be true. While others would turn in scorn and walk away. To them, I give my love and hope that they find what they are looking for, I pray that they will come to realize that open hearts and minds are the happiest. And to those who peek but do no look. I give you courage and I give you strength. For you will need those to become what you want. You will need those to face the challenges of becoming who you are. And to those who give their all and are hopeful and do not hesitate. To those I congratulate. Today it is not easy to be one of us. It is not easy with the people who laugh and look upon us with contempt. For you know what you are don't you, You are a dreamer. A person of thoughts and hopes. For you I pray that you will stand tall and proud in this world of grays. I give you my love, so that you may shine about all. It is us who will find the door to other worlds. It is us we will escape through the windows and experience things like no other.   How can I explain to you what I have experienced? How can I draw a picture for you of what I have seen? For these things are too vibrant and too full of emotions and feelings to put it into simple words... to draw with the dull colors that we have. But I will try. I will try to tell you of what I see. I have been to the corners of the world. I have been in the darkerst of jungles, hunted by beasts not many have seen. I have explored the pyramids of Egypt and fought for my life in the Amazon. I have experienced passionate love in the plains of Africa. I have touched magnificent beasts and seen them bow down to my will. I have brought peace. I have been the cherished leader of all. I've been a mother, a teacher, a lover, a ruler... I have been everyone's dream. I have been the heart of the people. These things I have known and things that I will know again when I rest my head and close my eyes. But this is not all. There is so much more that I cannot even begin to describe. I wish I could, but for fear of ruining what I treasure most, I dare not. I dare not destroy the things I've seen. For these are the things that keep me going on. They are the fuel to my fire, my soul. They are who I am. They are dreams, and I the dreamer.

      If you look back on your life the only true person you can blame for your troubles and misery is yourself.  People have always told me that sometimes when you have something and don't realize it... later on when it's gone they feel the loss. I always thought they were so silly. How can you not realize what you have? I always thought I would understand what was in my life and treasure it. Too bad life doesn't go as you want it to. I fainted today on the bathroom floor because i've been sick. When I came around I was just laying there and started thinking about things. I realized I've been carrying around this dead weight for awhile now... and for the past couple of weeks it's actually started effecting me. My moods have been somewhat forced when I'd rather just walk around as a zombie. I think it's also the cause of why I've been so sick these past couple of weeks.   I had something really special... something I truly cared about. But a fear of myself and what I can do to others got in the way of my thinking. Instead of facing the problem, I ran... I ran as far as I could away. But not just from the problem... from myself. I really want what I had back, but I don't think I can get what I want. For once in my life I can't have it. Everything has come so easy to me but I realize even if I tried... it still would avoid me.   I slowly progressed from the floor of my bathroom to the comfort of my bed. Even as comfortable as my bed is... it doesn't soften the pain. Under the covers I started to try and form a plan to resolve my pain. The only plan I came to though was to confront the situation.... that can't happen. If I did, so many more problems would arise from the situation. People would get hurt and things would be said. So for the time being all I can do is bury it deep within me. But that won't help for very long. As I've realized, you can only bury the past for so long... gravity doesn't work here... everything will rise eventually. I could try and forget about it... but i've also realized that subconsciously everything is stored until the worst possible moments.   Maybe when i've finally confronted myself and realize why i'm so scared of me I can deal with this... but until than i'll just wade in my misery and hope to find an island which I can rest my weary self upon.  "The power of hiding ourselves from one another is mercifully given, for men are wild beasts, and would devour one another but for this protection."

      I feel as if I'm walking through a deep puddle. I'm surrounded by water on all sides and there's nowhere for me to go. I'm lost and don't know which direction to take. Everywhere around me I see ghostly shapes pass here and there. Thoughts, memories, feelings... they all haunt me and I'm not sure how to grasp them. They swirl around me and confuse my every move.   I'm starting to think that there is no way out of this thing. I'm lost and cold. There's nobody to help me and all my friends have left. I've angered a lot of people and hurt so many others. I don't know what to do... I'm so helpless and I think I'm giving up.

      Sometimes just sitting with people in silence can be quite entertaining. Especially when one says something out of the blue that just makes you wonder what they were thinking. That's what happened to me tonight. I was watching the move "It Runs in the Family" with my mom and sister and then the credits were rolling and we were all just sitting there. Well suddenly Kathering says, "I'm constantly constipated" And we just sat there for a couple of seconds... then me and my mom just bust out laughing. Ahh, it was pretty funny I must say.  Well what else did I do today? I worked. Yeah, I worked. I went in at 1:00 and was supposed to get off at 6:00 but ended up getting off at 7:15. I wasn't too happy about that, but hey, what can you do? It's work.  I've come to the realization I hate glass. It's just... so... asking for fingerprints. At work... there is glass EVERYWHERE! I mean, I guess because it's a salon or what not. But I have to Windex everything all the time. And then, I got to shampoo people's hair. It was really weird... but you know, it's my job.  Also, today at work. I got locked out. I was taking out the garbage in the back and then when I came back I realized... the backdoor has no handle. So... I decide I have to walk all the way to the front. Didn't realize that it was so far. I would've knocked except Julie was doing someone's hair so I decided I shouldn't bother her. Oh well, I love walking around in heels in cold weather with a sheer shirt on.

      Hum dee dum. Today I went to the mall and switched out some gifts and got this insanely cute outfit. It's a pink/black striped shirt with a bow on top and then this really cute skirt that ties on the side.  Oh man... then I came and hung out with Angela... that was a lot of fun. I went to the mall... again. We went to hollisters and I had these two hott guys hit on me. Course I was running around hollisters with tank tops on... that was more of Angela though. They were 20 and 25... haha... oh tori, you just look so old!  Yeah, well we're playing Super Mario Brothers and then watch Tuck everlasting... goodnight!

      Ahh, Christmas Day... what a wonderful time. We actually slept into 9. Do you understand how rare that is for us on Christmas? In fact, it's so rare... It's never happened. Well, I enjoyed waking up at 9...still a little grouchy, but hey... we can't get everything. Well... so we all go downstairs and behold the glory of the Christmas room. Yes, well... because my dad is so obsessed with "A Christmas Story" (great movie!) he decided he wanted to reenact part of the movie. Yes, we hid a BB gun behind the couch for Jordan. Mother didn't agree with the gun but father says "it's part of becoming a man"... my ass. Oh well... yeah, I got everything I wanted, except a car. Next year guys... next year.  I think I did get enough perfumes to last me a lifetime. But I'm happy... I have a selection other then Bora Bora and Curve... woot. I also received 3 purses... rock on. I LOVE purses... and they are all so cute. Well... if you count the one Becca's giving me for my present... that's 4 purses. I love purses... another kind of theme I got was.. you know those letter purses and that whole line of stuff? Well, I didn't know my parents accepted the fact that I'm called Tori and not Victoria... well I found out today that they do. All of the things I got were with T's... I'm so happy. A ring, a bracelet, a purse and a wallet. I think it might also have to do with the fact that there are no V's on that stuff.   I was highly disappointed when they told me they had got me a 200$ gift certificate to Crabtree... but ended up not doing that because I got the cat... which overall cost about 150... I think somewhere around there. Well.... I'm not sure what I would've wanted. A cat... or a shopping spree. I need more clothes but they did give me 50 dollars which will cover a pair of pants... on sale. Oh well... live with what you've got. I guess... because I've got a job now I can deal.  Well tonight is going to be fun-filled with games and such because we always do those things on on holidays. Last night we skipped because I saw Lord of the Rings. I'm glad to know I can ruin my whole family's source of entertainment just because I'm not there. Well... mother is calling me down for desert. It's tiramisu tonight... I love tiramisu!

      Oo.. it's Christmas Eve... too bad it doesn't feel like that. More like Spring Break.  Well, today was fun. Becca spent the night last night and we had fun talking and such. Then in the morning Becca went home and I lounged around for a bit. Then Angela called and we decided it was time that we did something on such a nice day. So we went down to NOFO... expensive little place but oh so cute. Well, I bought gum, mathces, and chapstick... woot, toris' cool. Yeah, then I came home and me and Becca went to go see Return of the King. Good movie except the ending... it was so dragged out. Favorite part is with Legolas and the elephant. Yeah, but I won't say much more for those who haven't seen it yet, David.  Well, anyways... Christmas is tomorow... the excitement has died down with age (oy... i'm so old) I swear if we wake up before 8 tomorow... somebody is going to die... grr, i'm a pirate!  Yeah, well I hope you guys have a wonderful night. I'm not supposed to be on the computer so call me and entertain me please! Except... I don't want to stay up till 1:30 like I did with david last night... oh no no... sleep is good.

      Today was really fun. I enjoyed it. Around 10 me, my mom, and my sister all went down to crabtree to do christmas shopping. Well... we go around and do all of this stuff which isn't worth mentioning on here. Except me and my mom figured out that when my sisters walks it looks like she's clenching her butt together. Oh man... how funny.  Anyways, we go into Victoria Secret looking for some sprays for a gift for katherine (my sister). Well, they have this really good deal that you can get 6 of any of their garden fragrances for 30 dollars. That is SO cool. Well, we all have this halarious good time sniffing all of these frangrances. I swear... I sniffed them all over 100 times. Woo... got a little fuzzy up in my head. And then we found out this other series of frangrances... "secret" well... I wanted Secret 33 and mom wanted Secret 88... so we got those too. haha... oh man, and my mom said she was done christmas shopping for me.  Well, then we dropped my sister off at her old job, Soigne, to get her hair done. Well, I went to pick her up and.. I GOT A JOB THERE! Woot... it's a cool place. It's crazy expensive though. It's like 180$ to get your hair done. Wow... like I have that money. And they do it SO GOOD! Yeah... the perks of working there... I get free pedicures, manicures, massages, spas, facial treatment, waxing, and anything to do with my hair. All I have to do is take them out to lunch. And if they dont' give it for free they give you MAJOR discounts. Rock on... Yeah, i got a job!  I GOT A JOB!

      Okay well today was full of worry. Yeah, a lot of worry. I don't know what's up but something is going and it's really confusing me. I wish people would just say what they're thinking.  Well after church Angela calls me and asks if I want to go see a play... well of course I do! So I ask my parents and they said no because it's Sunday. And well I told them that they said when I was 16 it was my choice for what I wanted to do on sunday. So my dad and my mom give that look to each other and then say fine. Of course as I walk out of the room my dad says... but you can't use my cars. Oh well, Angela drove me. It was awfully fun running around having angela take pictures of me. It was halarious that she was trying to get me to be serious though.  Yeah well the play... we got there half-way in. REALLY CONFUSING! Oh well.... Tom and Anna were in it and they rock.   It's also very amusing when me and bethany can both fit into tom's clothing. Yeah... wow... me and bethany make up Tom!

      Okay.... today TOTALLY rocked. You have no idea how happy I am. Everything is so peachy!  Well, the day started out pretty boring. I mean... I was thinking about just laying down and dying from boredom. Well then, Andrea calls and is like 'HEY! Me, matt and Lee want to do something, you want to do something?'   Well... OF COURSE i want to do something! So they come over to my house around 6:40 and they hang out for a bit before we decided what we're going to do. We decide movies are always entertaining. Well, there's no movie that we wanted to see in the theater....so we decide we'll rent one. First we have to go and pick up Matt's girlfriend, Kirsten ( I know it's not spelled right... but I can't spell it how she does) She was really cool. Then we go to Blockbuster and pick up Old School... what a FUNNY FUNNY MOVIE!   So during the whole time while we're driving... we're playing pa-diddle. Pa-diddle is a game where you watch people's cars and when they have any kind of lights broken or out you yell pa-diddle and touch the ceiling of the car. Well... each time you win, the other person has to take off an article of clothing. Well... the game was boys against girls Boys:16 Girls:3.... yeah, me and Andrea are horrible at that game. So when we get back to Matt's house me and Andrea strip down to our underwear and prance around for a bit. Then we start the movie... then we stop it so me, lee, and andrea can go get food at the grocery store. Interesting times.   Back at the house we had so much fun being stupid. Then lee popped a play gun at my face. THAT HURT! Well... so I start slamming him against matt's garage door. It was so much fun wrestling with Lee... hot diggity dog. Man, Lee is my best guy friend... rock on Lee! Then i came home... woot!   Oh and by the way... I got a cat, his name is Lee.

      Sometimes there are things in life that are so wonderful you can't begin to describe them.   I'm in the mood for changing my blog, but maybe i'll wait for the new year to do that. I'll keep this and then i'll come up with a new theme and colour and maybe a new template. Well, actually... I like this template, i'll keep it for awhile.   So today was my first two exams. I liked today. They were easy and in the first one we were all talking before all of them were turned in. Mr. Grant... bad exam teacher. Then in English we left 5 minutes early because we were all done and Ms. Schmitz rules. Then I hung out with David for a bit.  Later I went over to Angela's. We broke out the old Super Nintendo and played Mario ... it was fantastically awesome. Then we went out for Burger King. I love food... but lately it doesn't seem to love me. Oh well, I don't know what's up. I can't eat a lot and I feel hungry all the time but then when I eat... two bites and i'm full. I HOPE I'M NOT PREGNANT! Hahah.. kidding... b/c you all know i've had sex and all. So then we come back and Angela had fun screwing with David's mind. He got really confused on who was who.   Angela rules... she makes everything better.

      Today was great. I love half-days. Nothing EVER happens on a half-day. At least not educational wise. Social life... yeah, stuff happened there.   So anyways, school was so relaxed... I love it. After school was fun. I rocked it out with my friends and hung out with David for a bit. Then Angela decided it would be fun to hide my car while I was talking to David in his car. Yeah, so... Florian and Angela hide my car... great. Well then, they come back and finally show me where it is. What dorks. Arg. And I had to give Florian a ride home. He started jerking my steering whell on the way home... great Florian.. JUST GREAT! Yeah, I want to die today... thanks. Then when we get to his house he wants to drive my car. Lucky me he neither has much driving experience or a permit. I'm just dumb enough to let him do it.  I've never been so scared in my life going 20mph.   But Florian's okay. He ranked me as one of the top 3 hottest girls at our school. So did Lee. Funny... they choose the exact three same people. Me, Chelsea, and Chandler. (in that order... hahaha) Wow... that makes me feel good about myself. I think they're lying though... boys do that. I'm probally.... number 65. Ouch... lol.  Well... yeah, David really made me upset tonight. Oh well, he made up for it. He called me and we had a highly amusing conversation on the phone.  Exams are tomorow. I'm so glad I dont' stress out over those things. Tomorow is easy anyways. Science and English. Science is open-note and English is multiple choice and matching. Rock on Ms. Schmitz.

      Ack, computers are stupid sometimes! Actually... people do stupid things to make me feel contempt for my beautiful machine. Viruses? Who the hell came up with that kind of shit? I mean... what do they get out of spreading misery to other people? I bet they're those lonely people who sit alone on saturday nights with a bowl of popcorn and beauty and the beast. Sadly... i've just described my social life. Haha... kidding.   But anyways, I haven't been updating my blog because on the computer I spend the majority of my time... the internet is on lock down. Somehow this program got downloaded onto our pc which pulled up like 20 pop-up ads when I opened an internet browser. Well... that was not cool so I asked my dad to see what he could do. Well now for the time being my dad put the internet on that computer on lock-down. Well... now the only thing that works down there is AIM. And well... on the other computer there is no AIM. So I can't have both.   Today I found the time to travel ALL the way upstairs to this computer and update for all you losers.  Angela... stay strong. You're so much better then all that moping crap. HE DID IT ONLINE?! WHAT A GENTLEMEN!!   School... how dull.

      Pop-up ads kill me. Good gracious. I wonder if they actually work? I mean, they're there to advertise stuff but I can't imagine anybody actually paying attention to them. And it doesn't help that Nathan downloaded some crap onto our computer that makes this one pop-up constantly. I'm just glad it's not porn and that kind of stuff. I know megan gets that and I feel sorry for her.  So today was pretty entertaining. I got all my english stuff turned in so now i'm passing. Woot! Yeah, next semester i'll do much better. This weekend i'm totally studying the whole entire time... except not because I have a social life. Damn you friends to the bowles of hell! You're nothing but distractions!   Yeah, well parties with people you don't like. They are no fun. Especially when icky guys hit on you. And bad memoires are brought up. Oh well.. Alex and Jordan were there. They're great and highly amusing.

      Its good to make friends with people you dont know. Especially ones you thought hated you in the first place. They tend to be pretty cool. (Sesame street and cars what cool topics) 	 Alright, so today at school. Nothing really happened too much. Kind of bland if you know what I mean? Oh no wait Christine came! I mean wow, I love Justine she is so great. What would I do without my Skarrs? Im going to miss them so much! Especially when John leaves for Iraq. Im so sad; I wont have contact with him for 3 years. Oh well, I did give him my ring so he can remember me when hes blasting those terrorists.   Life is really screwy guys do you know that? Its really crappy sometimes. My life is like that right now. And I dont know what to do with it. Throwing it in the trashcan is not an option and neither is the disposal. Im thinking of taking it to an arts and crafts center to try and glue back the pieces and then add some fluff to it. You know throw on some confetti and noodles. Yeah, sounds good to me.  Well tonight was fun. I went to the band concert for my 3 extra credit points. So I get there and there are not too many people to hang out with but I did find David. So I hung out with him. And by hanging out we listened to the band. Woot thats awesome, eh guys? So anyways I pity the people that actually listened to my band concerts. For three years I put people through that crap Im sorry. Yeah, band was no fun that teacher hated me with a passion. That could be because I said some pretty nasty things to him in front of the whole class. I mean he deserved it. I cant help the fact that hes so large that his button popped off and hit me in the forehead (no joke). I HAD to say something to that. I probably couldve worded it better but anyways. I got my parents called on those particular comments. Got grounded for a month too. Man was I a bitter person during middle school.   Well anyways back to tonight. After the concert David and I are walking out to his car. Yes, HIS car not mine! I mean Im the girl, shouldnt we stop by my car first. I mean, its not like David has to worry about strange men jumping out and molesting him. Maybe Michael Jackson.. But other then that, I think he has no worries. What a horrible gentlemen. Well anyways so we get to his car and what do we see? David is stuck. Pulled to close to the car in front of him and the guy behind pulled too close also. How funny. So anyways, David starts flipping out about how his parents are going to get pissed at him. Not like he has a CELL PHONE OR ANYTHING! Well, the smart-ass finally remembers what a cell phone is for and tries to call. Too bad for him his cell phone isnt working. Well then he gets the SMARTEST idea to try and take the battery out to fix it!   about that! What is it with guys obsession to fix things? They always tend to screw things up even more. It must be a part of their manly/macho thing. Men, what to do with them?  But anyways so not only is David stupid hes clumsy. He drops the battery under the car. And to show off his gentlemen like qualities he makes me get down and get it. What am I  your bitch? Just consider that your Christmas gift David and the fact I didnt rip your head off when you called me Baby how degrading.   So tries to put the battery back in, doesnt work. God must have really hated you tonight David. Well anyways so I want to leave but the poor baby needs to make sure nobody tries to attack him. So were just sitting around waiting for one of the car owners to come and leave. Finally the rear-end guy comes and goes. So David can leave. I hope this teaches you a lesson David.

      Today... what to say about today? I could say nothing happened at all but that would be such an utter and complete lie. Well my day started off lovely. Lee picked me up for breakfast and we had a really fun time. You know, stripping in lee's car, who wouldn't like that? So after that I went to school, go figure... didn't do much there until afterwards. Uh, after school I had to wait for angela to get done with SGA so she could take me home to help with Spanish... Angela's a great friend, I dont' know what I would do without her.  Anyways.... I have a boyfriend, I've been kissed. That is all you need to know for right now.  So anyways, Angela comes over right? And she tries to give me lessons on kissing using sock puppets. Guys, I mean... sock puppets. That totally made my day. Seriously... she used my tigger socks and was doing role playing. My goodness... I thought i'd die from laughing so hard. Then afterwards we decorated paper bags with FUNNY FUNNY DRAWINGS. Oh man, good times guys.... good times.  Oh and for what I figured out about myself today. I'm a horrible kisser. And i'm WAY more girly then I thought I was. And I act stupid in situations which i'm nevous about. So overall... i'm a loser. I'll cry in my corner now and leave you alone.

      My dad is halarious. Kind of like Angela's dad but in a different sense. He always manages to shoot down everything I say and point out how stupid I am. He also makes fun of my vocabulary or rock on, dude, fool, and rock it out. I mean, come on... those words ROCK! My dad is such a proper guy. Who needs that? Actually, I would prefer to have a gentlemen be my boyfriend that some punk ass loser. (eric you rock) HAHHAA MY DAD JUST STARTED DANCING! AHHHH! TO FELIZ NAVIDAD! AHHH, THIS GUY CRACKS ME UP! Oh no... he's trying to get me to dance... i'll be right back guys.   Okay.... 5 minutes later and making fun of dad.... i'm back.  Well anyways, David is the devil and he is a horrible person. One of these days i'm going to get my posse of 1/3 of the school and take him down. David that's it.... it's on. And, i'm going to win the bet... don't you worry.  Oh yes, that brings me to my revelation of the day. I've realized that i'm very competitive. To the point of me tripping and falling on the railing and rolling down the school ramp. (Yeah, remember that Angela) Well anyways, I can't stand to lose.. it irks me beyond comprehension. I would totally kill to win. This is bad, but oh well... it adds some zest to life if you know what I mean.  David... you're great.

      once again... courtney has blown my mind with her utter amazingly coolness. I just don't know what i'd do without my solitary black chic. We've decided that sometime in our life we are going to make choconilla girl shakes because chocolate girl + vanilla girl = Choconilla girl shakes. We plan to own a store and everything. We're going to be some crazy rich bitches. Woof!  I'm still lovin that Alias show... it's great. Go Will.. you're the MAN!  I forgot to tell my loving adoring fans that on Saturday my bottom lip was swollen up about 3x it's size. It looked like I had gotten in a fight. Maybe that's because I was fighting.. go figure. Yeah, so I stayed home with my pathetic self. I mean, my lip, my back, my tummy, my head... and my pinkie toe (no joke) were all ailing me on Saturday. The pinkie toe was the worst of them all... man, stubbing that thing is not very good for your health. Well anyways, 8 tablets of extra strength tylenol, a heating pad and some blistex and a good nights rest has got me almost back to normal.   What is normal anyways? Certainly not me or any of my friends. I don't do normal... it's just not my thing. I mean.... SOMEBODY has to roll down the halls during lunch. And if Angela and I don't do it... who will? Good gracious, I don't even want to think about who would take our place. I won't mention any names but right now there's this "big pig" doing it and now i'm going to have nightmares too night. Stephen would understand what i'm talking about.   Well anyways... that's my life in a nutshell for the time being. Actually... more of a banana peel. But i'll leave you off with a courtney quote...  blaquegoddess05: hahaha, it took me a while to get that blaquegoddess05: but it was very funny once i did!

      Southern accents rock... they're sexy. And anyone who doesn't agree with me... get over it, I could not care less. (my dad proved me wrong on that phrase... he's too smart for his own good)  So today, eh? It was pretty fun. I've realized that highschool is just a continuation of middle school. I mean, middle school drama, it doesn't leave you... it just intensifies. I mean... people hating me? How childish. I've never spoken to them, except maybe to say excuse me in the hall, I dont' even know their names and they don't even know what kind of person I am. I guess they just automatically assume i'm a total bitch. I'm sure this all relates back to how what bitchy looks I have. These looks are going to get me nowhere in life. I think plastic surgery is in order... who is with me? Post comments down in the right... I'll ignore them, but just so you feel like you have a say.  Oh man! My best friend, becca (don't worry Angela... you're still at the top) is moving away in a month! I'm going to miss her sooooo much! No... this is why I don't like the end of highschool... people leave!  Tomorow I can't update my blog... i'll be gone all day. Maybe i'll do a quick one in the morning just to say I did.  So I get home from school and I just go to quizilla and start taking tests... it was quite fun. So if you're interested... my quiz results page has been updated... go figure.  So I realized today that I don't wink enough. I used to wink ALL the time. Seriously... it was just my thing. It was my signature or something. I just dont' know what happened. I really miss those days. And now it just doesn't feel right. The wink isn't the same. I'm doing it right now and somehow I know it's not as cute as it used to be. I'm horrible... I need to do some wink practice in the mirror. That's my goal this weekend... to bring back the winking.  Guess what, I own a yo-yo now. Go figure... I never was good with those toys. I guess i'll have to learn. Right David? *wink* (haha... the only winks I do now a days are in text... i'm such a nerd)  HTML was the death of my coolness... now I'm just another computer geek.

      I like being able to walk down the halls of my school and every other person I pass I can say hello to. I mean, I'll just be walking down the hall by myself and then WOAH... HERE COMES A FRIEND. So I say hello or give a what's up. An occasional hug or high-five is in order. And then there's the rare friend that actually stops and talks to you. I like those people... they are what make my day a good one. This just makes me feel like I know everyone in school... or at least the majority of them. And for some odd reason I think this annoys David... oh well.  So today was relatively good. Some bad things happened but I managed to smooth them out.  History projects are great when you do them with Andrea, Eric and Courtney. Especially Courtney because she can go along with anything. I LOVE YOU GIRL!  Okay guys, you know what I've realized? While we were watching our history video I totally realize that I look really bitchy and mean. Like, if I was someone else and saw me walking down the hall... I would be like "oh, she's probally mean!" I guess people don't think that because usually when I'm in the halls I'm rolling on the ground or something. You know, skipping down the hall or just being stupid. Oh well, I guess I can't do anything about that.

      Wow guys... 728 visits in one month. I'd like to thank you guys! I love you!  Well anyways, today was really entertaining let me tell you. In history me, eric, andrea, and courtney were working on a History project for colonial times. Oh man, it was GREAT... really GREAT! Yeah, me and eric rolling around on the ground (not together) that was entertaining. And also playing the part of about 5 different people in the same outfit really works out. You just go to use a little big of imagination and everything will be ALRIGHT!  I figured out today that I enjoy pissing people off. For some odd reason it gives me a sense of power. I don't' know if this is a good thing... I think I'll just laugh at myself.  And by the way guys... Homestar makes me happy. Read this quote from it. You won't understand unless you've been there.  "...That is GARBAGE sister.... having to put up with you is like having to put up with GARBAGE. I don't know where you get off. But it's definitely not at the homestar station anymore. Looks like you're riding the 7:30 alone train to aloneville, making stops at ex-girlfriend junction and west-BREAKING up with you! Oh... and you can KEEP the collector's plate." -homestar runner

      Okay, so a whole new look is now on my blog. I'm really liking this whole red and black theme. Two of my favorite colours. Well, apparently everybody else likes it so i'm going to keep it up for awhile. Yes, the title and description DO mean something. Am I going to tell you? Probally not. Oh well, just bask in the glow of the colours to keep your mind off of it.   So, I've added a couple of new features to this thing. One, I have a new quiz results thing... so if you take any interest in that... i'll update that periodically. And also, i've followed the trend of Chatterboxes... i'm not sure if i'm going to keep it up. Depends on if anybody writes in it. I'm hoping I have enough friends to do that for me. If not, i'll take it down to hide from the embarrasment.  Well today, I got a lot of attention for my hair... i'm glad. I love you people (see Angela, I have peoples... you don't) Yeah, and I was wearing a hott shirt to boot. Oh yeah, today was PRETTY good. Except math. Math was an embarassment that I hope to never repeat. And english, oh man... that's killing me.

      I wish it was Halloween for some odd reason. I really don't know why but I wish it was.  Tom, you worry me. I mean for real.   I have work today and Rebecca is going to fix my hair! Yay! I love her... she's awesome. She was making fun of my mom last night. Rock on.  Alright, I should go get ready for work. I mean, for real guys. I don't think they'd appreciate it if I showed up in pajamas. Although it would add a nice touch. I'm no so sure how the customers would react though. It might make me appear unclean.

      I am so fucking angry right now. Today was so great, I got my hair cut and I went shopping and it was just such a nice day. Then I got home and saw my hair and just started to cry. How could anyone possibly cut my hair that bad. It was so ugly. Nothing was even and it was all chunky. I don't know what she thought I had asked her to do to my hair but this was NOT what I had in mind. My back was uneven, my layers were uneven and there were places where the hair was an inch apart from the other peices. I dont' understand how someone could get their license for cutting hair when she did this to me. Ahh... i'm so upset. I'm going to cry some more.

      Well howdy everyone! Um, Florida was awesome. I actually got my pictures taken with Chip and Dale, timon, and Pluto. Then after my picture with Pluto this guy came up to me and told me that i'm going to be in a Disney Promotional movie because they were taping people who were getting pictures with Pluto. I don't know about this guys, I mean I signed the papers and everything, but I looked at my picture and my hair is going out of wack. It's just plain wacky.   This snow... I just dont' know about it. A 9 hour car ride turned into an 11 hour car ride.. not good. Especially when you have a kid that did not take his riddilin (the stuff ADD kids take) Yeah, so I was going out of my mind.   Alright, Well angela is here and she might be writing an amusing blog entry on mine later tonight... STAY TUNED!

      Hello cold, dark, and ugly world, my name is Ta-ta-ta-tori! giggle! Today this really cool girl Angela came over to my house.  Her legs are fatter than mine.  Anyway, we watched CSI together and colored in My Little Ponay coloring books.  My glass is half empty.    Did I mention I have a boyfriend?  I am so cool, to have a boyfriend.  Angela (my legs are skinnier than hers) doesn't have a boyfriend.  Do you know any hot dudes out there to date her? She's really hot and people want to do her.  Oh wait, back to  my  boyfriend.  His name is Dahveed, but I call him davey.  Kind of like Davey Jones, but different.  Davey calls me sweetheart.  I like that.  He is my boyfriend.  He has hair.  I like it when its longer. Sometimes he squints his eyes really funny as to show disapproval, which makes me want to show some disapproval.  He has an identical twin sister.  I think he was supposed to be a girl too, but lucky for me, he's only part girl, so I can legally marry him.  Our first child will be named Davis.  Our second child will be named Chavis.  Chavis will also be part girl, part boy.  I think that's special.    I can drive.  But I don't have a car.  I drive my mom's Sable.  Sometimes I drive with the windows down and let the music blast really loud and people think I'm really really a cool person.  And not only hot, on the inside too.  Yeah, I think that's the best way to meet guys.  Either that, or on field trips.  And sometimes I meet guys and then I smile and show my pretty gums, but then they walk away.  Luckily, Davey likes me anyway because he, like all boys, is deaf.  Wait, how does that have anything to do with seeing my gums? Sometimes I get ahead of myself because I'm so darn gifted.  Mother Fucker.  oh my did that slip out?  I like to say those words when the bum brothers of people Angela (my legs are smaller) goes on one date with are around.  Really makes Courtney and Angela (fatter legs than me) weirded out.  That, and some other stuff that goes on in cars with significant others.    Me and Angela (FAT FAT FAT) are really cool.  Soon, we are going to go to the mall and dress up like rockstars and see what happens.  I bet we'll get lots of numbers.  Uhhh... (uhps, I have a boyfriend, don't I?) I mean like in PreCal.  Wait, I flirt with every boy anyway!  It's ok then.  I'll just give them all to Angela (did someone say thunder thighs?).   Davey is awfully cute.  I go for those gap boys, don't cha know.  Well it's time for me to go.  I would say something positive, but I forgot, I hate the world.  Goodnight everyone.  Wear your condoms.    Written by: Angela.  I am nice.  I swear.  She doesn't care.

      Oh man....a 10 hour car ride with my brother and sister is not what I needed. Man oh man. Oh well... here I am in Florida now, on the computer. I think I'm addicted to this thing. I have seperation anxiety whenever I'm away. So anywho... we're stopped at a Wendy's and my mother goes... "Will you pass the chips?" What the hell are chips? Excuse me, I thought we lived in America and they were called French fries! Ugh, my mother is so Canadain. So I turn around to her and say... "Mother, I know it's been hard adjusting to America this some odd 30 years... but please learn that they are French fries, and if you truly want to sound American you can call them Freedom Fries." Luckily... my comment to her distracted her enough to make her forget that she was asking for my fries. Therefore I ate the rest of them... yay! And who says 'pass' these days? Canadians... i'm only half-way there. The rest of me is from Montana.  I learned today that gas stations DO NOT have magazines! I told my mom last night that I wanted to go to the store to get a magazine for the trip. Well, you know what that darn Canadian told me? She told me that we would get one at the gas station... 3 gas stations later... all I got was jolly ranchers... OH poo!  Ahh, warm weather... oh how I have missed thee.  Once again... blog updating is getting kind of slack.  You can thank David for that.  What else to write about? Hmm... my life is going okay right now... OKKKKKKKKKAY!  Ahh... the sound of polics sirens in the background is oh so comforting. And let me tell you.... the Hilton, although expensive, is not my favorite place to stay. I mean, come on! Its pink and aqua... what is up with that? It looks cheap and kind of sleazy.  And then the room... the furniture does not mathc. THe couch is striped and the chair is plaid... um, hello? Do they no thave people decorate these things? And then the comforters are orange with pineapples. I don't know guys. And there's no porch? What the shanizzle is up with that? I'm much more of a Marriot girl I admit. Hotels these days... going downnnnnnnnnnnn hill! h

      Okay, okay. So it's been a week from my last update? That's horrible guys, just horrible. What kind of blogger am I?   Anywho. Florida on Thursday til Sunday unless David can come up with a good enough reason for me to stay. Um, yeah... told my dad I don't want to be mormon anymore... he took it quite well. He said he respected that i'm growing as a person and need to discover things for myself. This is why I like my dad more then my mom. He is very calm and understanding. I will never be like him... I wish I could. But i'm a very irrational person. I don't know where I get it from but hey... who cares.  I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

      I think I was realtively well behaved today. Now, I would not say that about some other people. No, no.... they were bad.  Prom commitee is fun. We go in, yell a lot and come out all friends.   I enjoy goodberry's with Nathan, Jack, and Taylor... I must admit that guys can be a lot more fun than girls. Then again, girls can be alot more fun than guys.   Ah... I dont' feel like writing now.  Goodnight.

      So, today starts off pretty normal. Go to school, and it's school. Nothing special goes on and nothing bad happens. Then I get home. I hate home.   So, it goes pretty normal until i'm talking to my dad about spring break. I don't want to go through it but in the end my dad said that if I wanted to leave then I should go ahead and do it. He told me he has no need for a daughter that doesn't want to be here. Then he said, there are three doors to our house, choose one and get out. So, I told him fine, give me a week and I'm gone. Now the problem is... the places where I could stay.. might not still be open. And then, where else do I go? Now that's the hard part. I can move in with my grandpa... who I know would let me. He lives out in Utah though... is giving up my friends worth my freedom. I want to say no, but it's what I've wanted for so long. Is it right for them to sacrifice my happiness for theirs? Is it right for me to hurt them? Nobody ever said life was easy. But nobody ever told me that I'd end up wishing I could just fade away.

      A note to my parents... because I'll never be able to tell them in person.  Mom... Dad,  Before I begin to tell you this I'd just like to let you know, I don't hate you.   Did you ever believe that I was good enough for you? Did you ever love me like you did the rest of my brothers and sisters? Why was it that I could try so hard to be the person that you wanted but I could never truly achieve that. What is so wrong with me that you could treat me so different from everybody else.   I know you tell me that you never treated me different from any of the others. But who who are you trying to fool? I lived in this house my whole life and saw everything that went on. Garrett dropped out of school, started doing drugs, drinking and stopped going to church. Now, all you talk about is how much he's changed and how he's getting somewhere in life.  Katherine slept around, she defied everything you asked of her. She didn't do anything she was told. Now she's mother's best friend. Dad's little angel. You buy her anything she wants, you pay for her college, her clothes, her phone, anything she asks and you give her.  Nathan failed Junior year. He left the house without asking, you never knew where he was, he pretended you didn't exsist. What have you done with him? Nothing... because you say it's a different situation... that by punishing him it doesn't get him anywhere.   And then there's me. I've always done exceptionally well at school. I did everything you asked. I was the child that everybody adored. I was perfect in the eyes of everybody else... except you. I brought home all A's but Katherine's B+ math test got put up on the fridge while my tests got thrown in some box up in the attic. I did dance, and art, and piano. But dad only came to Katherine's recitals and the boys basketball games. When mom asked me to do band... I did it and then her response was, "why aren't you 1st chair" when I was 4th. I tried to hard to be everything you could possibly want... but it was never enough.  Now you're asking me why I didn't tell you this before? Well, I have but every single time I did I started crying and then you'd tell me to talk to you when I'm not emotional? How can you ask me not to be emotional about my pain? Do you not know how much you've hurt me? I don't think I'll ever get over this. They say time heals everything... I don't think time will help me. How can anyone get over being shunned by their parents? It's not a simple thing.   So now... it's too late. Dont' even try because the wall is already up and 5 feet thick. No matter how hard you try, you're not getting in. I've got other people to take care of me now. Thanks... but no thanks. I'm fine without you.   From you Daughter, Victoria

      I always hurt people. No matter what my intentions are I can't help but rip out their hearts and leave them on the ground. I seriously don't know why I do it. Maybe it's because I was raised watching my sister and saw her do it to so many people. Maybe it's the fact that I've been hurt so many times in my life I feel like everybody else needs to feel part of the pain I have. I know part of it is because when I feel people get to close... I need them to back away and learn I'm not something you play with. Sure, I've gone through a lot of shit in my life. I 've had my heart ripped out more then once and thrown carelessly away. I've given my soul to others and all I got in return was a thank-you card. That still doesn't give me the right to hurt other people.   Another thing... stop trying to understand me, none of you ever will. I hate when people say they know what I've been through... because I've never met one person in my life who truly has. Granted, I've never told a single person ALL that's happened to me, and I probally never will until I meet that one person in my life. I was talking to my cousin Jennifer today, the one person who knows everything. I've never hidden anything from her because I know she could never judge me. I could go out and sleep with 15 guys and she would never judge me. But today, I was over at her house and we were discussing this... and she even admitted that nobody could possibly understand the hurt I've been through in my life. Sure, I act like it's not really that big of a deal. You guys know something has happened but you really don't understand what... and I doubt you ever will. So please stop asking me what's happend. If I tell you it only opens old wounds that still need time to heal.   Sometimes, you just have to learn that other people's past is not your own. You shouldn't touch things that aren't yours unless invited. And you shouldn't ask unless prompted.

      Two things I learned today at the Spa: 1) the phrase "The price women pay for beauty" is really true... especially at Soigne (55 for a haircut? 95 for colour? please guys... do it yourself) 2) There are a lot of people who have dry, flaky skin behind their ears. Yes... this is nasty. Please people... give some loving to your ears! I mean... it's gross touching that stuff... I subconsciously touch my ears now to make sure I don't have that... ew.  Got my ears pierced today. 16 years of worry of pain and I get there and I see a 6 year old do it and not cry... I got the nerves and did it. I cried. (haha... kidding... although, that would've been PRETTY funny)

      Life....psh!  So, first day back, eh? I must say it went relatively well. I'm glad I finally got to see all my friends again. Or at least the ones that I didn't see over break.... which was basically most of them. So really.... I'm just glad to see David... and Courtney. So, brand new start and I'm hoping I'll do better on this one. Everybody pray for me... except, not.   Yeah... I can only be on the pc for an hour now. Because of that bet I made with my dad. And this blog has horrible sentence structure. I'm sure that I'm doing it all wrong. But I really don't care. Periods are fun to place anywhere you want. So... back off. I dont' care.

      So, new year's resolutions, eh? Well, let's see...  My first is to take my studies more seriously and to have better studying habits. I think it helps that I have this bet going on with my dad. But that only works for the first six weeks. I want to be able to motivate myself on my own without my dad's money backing me up.   Another goal I have, which I notice Angela does too, is to go on a diet. Yeah, yeah... not a losing weight one. Well, actually, I do want to lose 5 pounds... but that's it, I SWEAR! It's more of a healthier food, get in shape kind of diet.  I need to exercise more, cut down on the sweets, and eat more fruits and vegetables. Yeah... good goal. And maybe not to eat after 9.   I also want to read more books. Like... at least two a month. I'd also like to expand to different genres. I think I should try reading some of my dad's books. He reads things like Sophocles and all those crazy guys. The Age of Napolean... my dad is such a nerd. Well anyways... on that topic I'd like to become more organized too. (okay, so maybe it wasn't really the same kind of topic... oh well)  Also, bed by 10 or 10:30. I need to start sleeping better.  "What if it's like a fireman hose and you just can't control it?"

      People never fail to amaze me. I think i've figured out the extent of our stupidity and our rude characteristics and then some asshole proves me wrong. Where I work there are some rich old bastards who think they're so smooth. I want to give them such a big punch in the face but knowing that they're here spending 100 dollars for a hair cut... I think that would be wrong of me. So earlier this week a 50 year old man Terry comes in for a day treatment. When he first walks in he comments on how pretty I am and kisses my hand. I'm sorry but I find this just slightly rude. Maybe some people find that charming but not me. Then today some guy came in and was like "Oh Julie I see you got another pretty bitch" Well gee... thanks.   What are we teaching our children? Another surprise came to me while I was washing this 6 year old's hair. (Who gives their children 50 dollar hair-cuts?) While I was washing her hair I was talking to her and she says "Grandma's staying at our house, but only for a few more weeks. Then she leaves" So I asked her... where is your grandma going? Her reply "Oh, she's going where everybody goes." Then I asked her where is that? "Oh, she's dying and going to hell, or at least that's what mom tells me."  I have a question. Why do we find it so easy to express love in terms of. I'm madly in love with you... or I've fallen in love with you. But when it comes to the phrase, "I love you" We find it hard to say. Don't the other two put more emphasis on it? Or maybe it's because I love you is pure emotion. It's not focusing on another word to take away the simple meaning we're trying to get across. Maybe when we over decorate things... it takes away from the real meaning. And why is it so much easier to hate then to love?

      Happy New Year Everybody! It was quite enjoyable waking up at 11:45 and then going outside to clean up fireworks. And i've learned that there IS such a thing as Grandma pudding.   Last night was a blast. Went over to Andrea's and had a party. It was quite fun setting off illegal fireworks. But i'm not really in the mood to write anything... but I hate work... and I really don't want to go tomorow.   Tomorow is going to be a sad day. It's the last day my friend Becca is going to be in Raleigh... on Saturday she leaves for college... I think I'm going to cry. It's always hard losing a best friend.

      Yeah today, was really long. I went to 4 hours of church and then another 2 later on. Ugh, and if we all remember correctly. I HATE CHURCH! Haha, but I went to another ward and saw some of my old guys.... Tyler, Gary, Brian, David and Brandon. Apparently brandon is taking me to Millbrook prom.. I promised him this 5 months ago? Hmm, well I don't remember that, but I guess a promise is a promise.   I would just like to let everyone know, I'm a beast, and I can take any of ya'll. Come on... bring it, I dare you. And also that tabb makes me laugh.   Desire 596: you guys are crazy Gopack44jv: you're crazy Gopack44jv: OH SNAP Gopack44jv: i got you  Desire 596: you make me laugh tabb Desire 596: a deep hearty laugh  Good times, good times.

      Today I worked, and worked, and worked. It actually went pretty fast. Work goes faster as long as I'm doing something. If I'm just sitting there it goes painfully slow. I'm always worried Rebecca will come by and be like "Get to work, there's always something to do!" And then she'll walk away and I'll rack my brain trying to figure out something I can do and then I realize it's all done, so then I end up walking around the store making it look like I'm productive... which is really tyring.   I got enlightener on my arm today... so now it looks like I've got a disease. That's cool though, I'm cool... haha. Kidding, kidding... I don't want that annonymous guy getting on my back again but how I think I'm so cool. (yeah... that's me)  My parents frusturate me, they're such hypocrites. But let's not complain about anything... I'm sure you guys have enough problems to deal with on your own. Although... if I ever have an extremely funny problem, I'll tell you. Like how my cat tries to eat my hair while i'm asleep? Now, that's just annoying... I'll wake up and a big chunk of my hair is in Sebastian's mouth... yeah, I can't imagine what that's doing to my hair.

      Okay wow, new blog guys. So, I go through like 3 freakin blogs before I finally settled with this one. I mean... I completely finished a blue one, and then I said no! Then I did this green one and sean was like, "Yeah, this rocks!" But then, we thought of pink.... pink is SO cool. So pink it turned out to be.  Well, I'm really going to get back into blogging... when I have time. There never seems to be enough time now a days. It's really sad, and it highly dissapoints me. I need more time in a day... could we please throw on like... 5 more hours? But, that won't happen so I'll just have to deal with the limited time we're given. You know, if we did add 5 more hours to a day... That would give us an extra 1,825 hours.... which would be about 76 more days. Wow, that's crazy.  Sean, you really do rock. And your shirts rock... they're hott. And I'm glad you helped me do this blog, you're a great inspiration. Remember to bring your camera on monday... me and Angela are going to look HOTT. (all guys, bring cameras... david, just bring yourself) But I love you Sean, and I'm glad you're my friend. Sorry I don't update as much... I know you like it when I do. Well, once again, you're awesome... really awesome, super awesome! Don't change!

      So here I am at Angela's. Man we had an awesome day today.  Everybody should have a button maker... they're awesome... they're cool. We enjoyed it a lot.  Snow, snow snow.... WHAT IS UP WITH THE SNOW!

      Update you say Angela? Well considering the fact that you're the only person I listen to when people say that... i'll take your advice.   My, this warm weather that we have had lately really gets to me. Well besides the fact that I had a virus in me ATTACKING ME TRYING TO BRING ME DOWN... I have thoroughly enjoyed it. Swinging and such is great fun.  I really miss living in a small town. I know that big cities always seem to have more to do but in reality... they don't. See, when I lived in Enumclaw, Washington... I was NEVER bored. I was always doing something with my friends outside and just... being a crazy kid. See, in my neighborhood all the kids would get together and play baseball, kickball, capture the flag, laser tag... all around the neighborhood. True... our neighborhood was one big circle and quite smaller then the one I lived in now... but I loved it. Another thing I loved was that everything was in walking distance. And at the age of 7 I was allowed to walk down to the grocery store by myself... that's how safe it was to live there. It was just awesome knowing everybody... I miss it.   Although I do love all of you guys... you're great... even that annonymous person who keeps harassing me. You're cool too, you make me laugh insanely loud, good for you!  Ah, the world happens to be okay with me.

      I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.  And I know all of you tomorow are going to come up to me and say "oh tori, I love your hair, it looks great!"  Don't do it, I know that's fucked up and cringe when you look at me. So do us both a favor and when you see my hair just say "damn tori, what the hell were you thinking"  It may not make me feel the greatest, but then at least we can make fun of me instead of me silently fuming over how people have to lie to me to try and make me feel better. You're not, you're making me feel worse. Damn, hair... who needs it?

      Oh man, I've totally forgotten about this thing. My poor blog... I've neglected you! Oh well, there wasn't much to say. Nothing really going on in my life.   I've come to the conclusion that middle school drama will never leave you. Not even as adults. It's kind of like a forboding cloud that hovers over you constantly just waiting for you to poke at it so it can pour all over you and soak you to death. You'll never truly be able to get rid of it. How sad.  Alright, I'm out. Drama on the chatterbox is highly entertaining.

      Why do people always feel like they have to be mean to each other? I mean, what is the point? By saying a nasty comment to someone, does that get you anywhere? Does being mean make you feel like a bigger person? By brining someone down, does that make you better then them? All I have to say is that you're very immature. Grow up, the world doesn't need people like you. And if you're going to be mean, be a big person and say it to their face. Not to their back, not on a fucking chatterbox, and not in some anonymous note. If you have a problem, I'd prefer that I know so that I can either fix it or prove to you how stupid you really are.   Here's a quote for all you guys. And girls... you have to admit, it is funny. "You'll only lie to two people in your life. The police and your girlfriend"

      Today was... extremely boring. I swear. But I did get my 8-page essay done. Well, the outline is done...  Okay, okay... you got me. I just wrote it out and I still have to type it up. I'm just taking a break for a moment. Seriously, I don't like writing papers that are worth half of my grade. No way, not my deal. But next week IS SPRING BREAK! Yeah, guys... this rocks like utterly. I'm so excited. I get to go visit my friend Becca out in Tu-tah. She left for college and left me behind. She could only take two suitcases and I didn't fit in the carry-on.   Okay, guys.. SPRING. YAY!  Elaina you've just got to understand. Seriously, begin to understand. Oh my gosh.. I wish school was RIGHT NOW! Right now! I swear, we'd be lau*gravity*ing.

      Do you know how many times I have intended to get on here and type in a highly amusing story for the day? Well, a lot. But I never did because I'm lazy. Now I feel bad because it's been over a week and I dont' really have anything to talk about. Well... I do remember one of my stories...  As I was walking down the hall of our schools this person walked by me. I glanced over and was utterly shocked by the fact I could not tell if it was a male or female. Now... this person had long curly blonde hair but the face was more (very much more) male. Now then I looked at the clothes and they were baggy, guy clothes. So I assumed it was a guy but then 'it' turned in such a fashion that it made it look like there could be some underlying boobage. I'm just so wierded out by this. I mean... a lot of people have this issue. I'm more dissapointed in my lack of judgement. I've lost my touch.   *Kachunk* --> That ones for you Elaina (bowles) You just don't know it yet.

      Apparently teal is not considered under the green family. So I was pinched today, several times.  So, I'm supposed to write about something... but i've got nothing. Although, the more I've been thinking about stuff lately the more I wished I hadn't. Sometimes when you ponder about something in your life you start to not like it. Or you just start to wonder what's the point. Ahh, I wish life was just not complicated. Actually, life isn't complicated... I make it complicated. So in reality, all I have to blame is myself, which I'm entirely okay with.   Wow, ants scare me.

      Today sucked, although I did make 30 dollars in tips. I also realized that after only working for 5 days these past two weeks i'm still going to earn 175 dollars, nice... 200 with tips. Rock it out tori... from now on you should skip more work.   Alright, what am I to do with life? Oh well, who cares... only a little more then a year to go and I'm outta here.

      I hate it when I have the time to sit there and pick at things that I don't like about myself. See, today at work there was nobody there so I was sitting staring idly off into space just thinking about myself. I've come to the conclusion that there are a lot of things that I should change but probally won't. Like, I believe that I'm too judgemental sometimes, not in the way that as soon as I see someone I mark them right then and there... more along the lines of judging people I already know. Sometimes my friends do things that I disagree with, stupid things, small things, just whatever, and I instantly a thought pops into my head. Not a good one. Or how they act around certain people, or in different situations. They tend to piss me off a lot, I know it's bad but I can't help it.  Another thing that I don't like is I tend to give off the feeling that I don't care a lot. Which, in general I don't. But a lot of the times if someone has hurt me or put me down... I tend to shrug it off or keep it somewhere deep down and build up a resevior of anger. I think I need to either truly learn how not to care (which according to Florian the steps to that are 1) Break up with david and go out with him, 2)Have sex with him and 3) Coo him a steak) or learn to address problems. Oh dear, that won't be happening anytime soon. Yeah, so I have WAY too much bottled up emotions in me. Not good.  And I tend to be too much of a flirt. Yeah, ask David... he'll roll his eyes and shake his head. Yeah, this is about the only thing I'm actually trying to change.   Oh man, life is not complicated, it's just people that are complicated.

      Oh man, sean... you are like the coolest guy ever! I don't know what I would do without my sean boy. Here's an awesomely cool picture he sent me from open mic nite...     And this is what he wrote according to it...  Mulletdrift:   i was talking to this guy about my pin and i was like this chick angela can make you one for a dollar, and he asked me is she hot? and i responded yah so i sent him this picture of angela, andrea, and you, and hes like yah well that chick in the white on the left, is waaaaay hotter. that chick being you  Uhh... what is this guy thinking? Does he not see my hair! It looks like I dunked it in some crap and left it hanging there. Angela looks way hotter then me, what is this kid... blind? Ugh, yeah right. Angela is so hott and sexy... woot. Hahah, i'm sure i'd think that if I was a guy. But seriously... what is up with that kid.   Now, then we had an even cooler conversation... dont' ask how it started, you don't want to know.   Desire 596:   i'm just so ugly, i cant' take it... i'm going to slit my wrists and die now (hehe)  Mulletdrift:   i think id probably jump off a bridge if you died  Mulletdrift:   because i would be like omfg, dood  Mulletdrift:   i never got a shot!!  Mulletdrift:   and then david would probably cry alot  Mulletdrift:   he seems like a crier  Desire 596:   yeah, he would... isn't that cute?!  Desire 596:   i mean, come on, he's crying over me.... I own him.  Mulletdrift:   omg, hahah, its so funny....  Mulletdrift:   because you do

      Brothers frusturate me. They take things without asking me. That, according to most people, IS WRONG! You shouldn't take things that cause other people great pain. Like... for instance the interent cord. Now, see... this is annoying because some of us ENJOY to do things on the interent. And all he uses it is to freakin hook up tv's so they can play their damn halo game... real mature guys... you're 18, grow up. So I had to go find a different cord because I knew he wasn't going to be home until around 11:30, yeah... no.  Alright, brothers... who needs them. Well actually... me and Nathan were pretty good friends when we were younger. We did a lot of fun things together. I miss those days, he was much cooler when he would play "Rock Star" with me. Yeah, we earned quite a few monopoly dollars from those gigs.

Yeah, Tabb's a good boy. Not as good as David, becuase I LOVE david. But Tabb's pretty cool and he deserves cookies, so i'm making him cookies. And apparently now everyone wants cookies too.  bustamove0004: so about those cookies?

      Why do we tend to keep things that we'll never use? I was going through my drawers today and I came across all sorts of things that really have no value in keeping. For example, back in 8th grade I went to the fair with my friends and I played a ring toss game and I won a little stuffed bird. This is something I found in my drawer. I understand why I kept it for a month but 4 years? That's a little insane. The memory is great but the bird in the bottom of my drawer isn't making me remember it.   So why don't we throw all these personal tidbits away? Even as I looked at the bird and thought it was pointless to keep it I hesitated to throw it away. There were other things in there like a broken bracelet that i'll never fix, a little keychain that my cousin gave to me for my 10th birthday and such things like that. I ended up throwing most everything away except a few that I still hold more of an attachment to. But even now I feel so empty with out my tidbits. That's it I'm going to cry now. I want my bird back.  Today went nice, I don't know why I wore that skirt though. Such a bother.

      Mondays really kill me. School is so hard and it's just a bother. And then I get home and there's nothing to do and none of my shows are on. It was raining today, it seems to do that a lot on Mondays. I did end up getting a bathing suit today and Jelly belly's... So it's all good.   Anyway, since none of my shows were on I was kind of surfing the television, I know... I'm lazy. But I came across that Swan show on Fox. For you who don't know what it is... They take two girls on each episode and give them a complete make-over (surgery, weight loss, eyes, etc.) and then they choose one of the two to go onto this final "swan pageant". I think there's 12 in all that make it but I'm not sure.  Well, I would just like to say how much I disagree with this show. And not just this one but all the make-over ones. Why is everything in our society dependent on how we look? Is physical attraction really that important? And honestly when I see these women that they choose... They are not that ugly. From what I saw all they had to do was learn how to take care of themselves. Maybe lose a few pounds, get a new hair cut, learn how make-up is put on. I mean they weren't the most gorgeous women on earth but they were by far not the most unattractive.   And then there's this whole other issue. A lot of the people watching the show are women just like them. Ones that have the opinion that they are ugly and have low self-esteem. Well, I'm sure that show is helping SO much to bring their self-esteem up. They see these women who like them that get their dreams. But for these other people, they most likely don't have the money to afford those kind of operations. So they just end up hating themselves more because they can't be like all those 'other pretty women'. I'm just so fed up with how our society views everyone. If you don't' fit into that one 'perfect category' you are doomed to fail at life and be a social outcast.   I understand the need to have a high opinion of yourself. But maybe they should focus more on improving yourself with how you are. Then the people watching them would actually have hope of being able to improve themselves also. It's just frustrating the way we depend on looks to get us somewhere in life.

      Okay... how in the world did I forget to mention prom? I am such a dork.  Anyway, because of who I am, the beginning of prom was very hectic. From 11 to like 2:30 I was setting up prom. Then from there I went back to work and had my hair and make-up done. Now the funny thing with Julie and up-do's. Connie and Nicole informed me that whatever I asked for would end up in a french twist. So, I was like... You know what, a french twist would go nice with that. Well, I ended up with only half a french twist and the top being curled. Oh, well... still looked good.   We were supposed to be done with my hair by 5 so I could be at david's by like 5:45... but we didn't get done till 5:45... so I hightailed it out of there and got to david's at 6:10. We did the whole picture thing, david can't put on a corsage. I met his parents and his mom is so cute! I love her accent, way more then david's... it rocks. But after that we left for Emily's and we got there and it was SO fun! We had chicken, quesidillas(sp?), broccoli, macaroni, other things! Also, David had brought mexican take-out with him. I'm SO glad we went there instead of going out to eat. After we had to stop at my house and get him his boutineer(sp?) because I had forgotten it. Also so my dad and mom could do the picture thing.  Now we went to prom and it was a lot of fun! I had so much fun dancing. There was SO much food. I hope everyone liked it. I'm so glad I went with David because he's awesome. And Jeremy was so funny with his dancing. Yeah, it rocked. Like utterly. Woot... prom WAS fun!!!! I wish it was again!

      Elaina... this is all for you.  After work today, I had 4 dollars because some lady had tipped me. And I REALLY wanted chick-fil-a. So I got to it, and we all know that their food is NOT cheap... at least for someone who spends only 'tip' money. So it was like 5.02... so I started digging around in my change. And I ended up paying it all in pennies. WHO IN THE WORLD HAS 100 PENNIES IN THEIR WALLET? Obviously me. I'm surprised that my wallet fits that many. But man oh man. The girl was laughing at me though and I normally wouldn't have done it but MAN I was HUNGRY! But that reminded me and Elaina with pizza money. 10 dollars elaina... and all in change.  Alright well today... today was very laid back and I don't know why. Probally because I choose to ignore all the teachers. YAY! Go tori!

      Okay wow, one again I forget to blog and neglect my duties. I feel so horrible! I have all these things that happen that would be so much fun to write about! But now it would just be lame. LAME!  I did have an interesting thing happen to me today. Katie Pooley comes up to me and says "Tori, I heard that you think the seniors are lame!?" Well, Katie heard it from someone else... and someone OTHER people knew about it. Geez people, I hope you didn't take that too seriously. I mean, there are some pretty lame seniors... but if you read this... it's not you. haha, kidding!  Today was SO utterly rockin though. At prom committe me and Elaina were having a BLAST! Then we had to go down to Wal-Mart and some other places to get things for prom. Well, we found everything for only 60 dollars! You guys... that is a total deal and we were having a rocking good time in these places. I mean... you have NO idea how funny the Dollar Tree can be. Well Elaina has an idea... she was THERE!   After shopping we came back to my house and actually made the things and WOW, that was way more fun then it should've been. Also on the way home and at my house me and Elaina had some PRETTY interesting conversations on how much it would suck to hate me. It's a very interesting conversation that anybody else would be confused about except us.  But then around 7 we started getting hungry and I REALLY wanted a pizza. But my parents weren't home and we had a total of 2 dollars. So what did we do? We most DEFINITLY paid in quarters. We broke open my daddies quarter box and man we had some FUN time with that. Yeah, Elainster and I are some rockin people who know how to have a rockin good time. Yeah!   ROCK IT OUT TO THE MUSIC!  Elainster... what would I do without you? Probally pay in pennies.

      I LOVE ANDREA SHE IS COOL! Man, we were having a rocking conversation tonight... but due to some things we said I won't post the actual conversation. But we've come to the conclusion that we have got the "senior-itis" out of our systems. Becuse when we were sophmores we hung out with the really cool seniors... and the seniors this year are kind of lame. So we're glad we got that out of our systems early on. There are very few cool seniors, sorry guys... you're class is just kind of lame. There are some cool ones though. Like David (but only because I date him, his sister is SO much cooler then him. Oh man David... what a loser) and some others.  Anyway, so prom night... I'm playing video games and eating mexican take-out. This is going to rock.

      Alright, I'm back! Not that you knew I was gone or anything. Maybe I had mysteriously disappeared but no... I just went to Utah for the week. Well... Let's review how that went, shall we?  The plane ride there was fine, I slept most of the way so I don't really remember it. And then the actual week went fairly quickly. Most of the time it was Becca and I trying to figure out what to do. We went shopping a lot, which was fun... We got matching sweat suits... The cute ones, yeah... We're not cool. And then we just had fun hanging out and watching movies. And I ate boxes and boxes of creamies! Oh yum, if you ever go out to Utah, they have THE BEST popsicles. I'm so sad that you can only get them there. I might have to go out there for college JUST for the creamies.   Then I also hung out with my sister and my soon to be brother-in-law, Scott. Who is pretty cool, I think I've thoroughly embarrassed Katherine now. And then I also hung out with my cousins Becca and Tracey, and trust me... The whole double Becca thing was REALLY confusing. But I found out that my cousins are extremely cool. Tracey is cool because he's 25 and still goes on Homestarrunner... Which, is cool. And then my cousin Becca is cool because she hangs out with Clay Aiken, Kimberly Lock, Reuben Studdard and basically a bunch of the other American Idol contestants. And then she baby-sits a bunch of famous peoples kids and such and this wasn't cool to me but she knows everybody on the Everwood set and dated that Ephram guy on the set and the Chris Pratt guy too. Oh well, I don't' know who they are. But I'm sure a bunch of girls are all insanely jealous (Like Angela). But that was basically my vacation, nothing special. Cracker Barrel was the highlight of my week though. Yum. Now let me tell you about the ride home.....   "The Trip Through Hell"  *Now Appearing in Wide-Screen*  So, my plane leaves at 6:25am... Which is hell enough but then it gets even worse. I get on the plane... And there is a baby in front of me, behind me and three to the side of me. They were all crying. So then we start to take off and we stop. It turns out something is wrong with the pressure and they inform us, "there's a technical problem that will take about 15 minutes to fix, don't worry, we'll be off soon!" So apparently "soon" is the two hours that we wait on the plane until they inform us that the plane won't be in service and we'll all have to find another plane. So I get off the plane and go wait in a 40 minute line to get another plane. Which, I could've got on the one right next to us but they wouldn't recheck my bag for me and so I didn't have enough time.   So I end up going back down to the ticket booth and recheck my bag for the 12:20 flight, meaning I was stuck at the airport for 6 hours. Luckily I was doing something the whole time except for about 90 minutes. I finally get on this next plane where my seat was a window seat. But when I get there, obviously with my luck there was two large men sitting in both the window and aisle seat. So, not really wanting any confrontation (extremely unlike me, I don't know what was up with me) I just sat in the middle. That wasn't too bad because I fell asleep. Then I sat at the Dallas airport for 2 hours and was bored out of my mind. Finally I got on the plane and was by myself! Or so I thought. Then at the VERY LAST possible moment this huge Australian man sat on the aisle seat. So I was still okay... Until later.   So he started talking to me, which is fine, but I couldn't understand anything he was saying. And then he sat next to me for some odd reason and was asking me all sorts of wired questions like where are we going? And what day it was? And my address... And my name? So I was like... uh, not answering the last two. Then when there was a moment of silence I got out my music and pretended to go to sleep. So he decides that I'm not really going to talk and he moves up to the seat in front of me to bug this other lady and to drink some rum. So with all that space I lied down to go to sleep. And lucky me I slept for most of the plane trip. When there was about 30 minutes left I woke up and decided to go put on my headphones (because somewhere in this story I had taken them off) and lay back down. So he saw that I had got up and decides since the other lady didn't want to talk (he had realized that when she told him if he snored when he went to sleep she was going to punch him) that he would try with me again.   So he comes back and sits down and I'm like "hey, not having my head near your ass" and I decide to sit up. Well he pats his leg and says "no, it's okay!" And I shake my head and say, "no, that's alright". Well because I'm basically the most naive person in the world when I'm drop dead tired, I decide that when I see lightning flashing outside that I should tap him and tell him to look at it. So I guess in Australia doing something like that is an invitation for him to hit on me. So he scoots over again and puts his hand on my leg and then puts his other hand around me and on my arm rest. Well, that... Is not right. So I push his hand off my leg, take my arm off the hand rest, and scoot up so his arm isn't touching me. Well that still doesn't get the idea across to him that I didn't agree with what he was doing. So he puts his hand back oh my leg. Well I pushed it off and said, "don't' touch me." Well that still doesn't get across and he moves his other hand off the rest and onto my ass. Uh... No. I grab his arm and move it back to him and said once again, "don't' touch me."  So finally he leaves me alone and scoots back over to the other seat. Then back again he comes like 5 minutes before we land and he starts asking the same questions again. And he then says "you're 21 right?" ... NO I'M 16! WILL YOU FREAKY PEOPLE LEAVE ME ALONE! I KNOW SOMETIMES I LOOK 18! But PLEASE! When I'm in a sweat suit, no make-up and my hair is in a messy bun... I LOOK 16! GRrrr... There are some SICK SICK people in this world. Arg, so after he finds out I'm 16, he REALLY leaves me alone. So when everyone is getting up to get off the plane he gives me a sick smile and beckons me to go before him. I shake my head and say no. Luckily before that this old lady behind me, really nice lady, had been talking to me. And she had asked if I was okay and that if I wanted her to walk out with me. Yes, yes I did. Then she waited with me until my dad came. When that Australian saw my dad, yeah... He didn't come near me. That's right buddy... You watch out my dad will kick your fucking ass! Sick people.... sick sick people. I feel so disgusted and violated.   Alright and just to make clear. I have nothing against Australians, I think they're pretty cool. Except the dirty ones, I don't' like perverts of any type. Gross. And Sean there is your update. And Elaina... you're cool.

      Ahh, today was awesome. At first I was really upset because my parents wouldn't let me go to the zoo with Courtney and Elaina. But because I didn't go I got to spend basically the whole day with David. Around 12 my mom, sister and I went down to the mall and then David and I met at my house around 2 and after doing a couple of things there we went out to Durant park.   And let me tell you... I never knew the park could be THAT much fun! *wink wink* (haha, kidding...)  After the park we went to see Hidalgo, horrible movie... good story, horrible movie. We had fun in the theater though... *cough cough*. Afterwards we came back to my house and it was highly entertaining watching David get his ass whooped by my 11 year old brother. Well, David did win most of the time but Jordan was playing on his knees and spinning around between every hit. And even then David had a hard time beating him.  Well, today was a good way to start off a GREAT week. Which reminds me... I really need to pack for tomorow...

      So, this morning I woke up around 3:00 because my stomach wasn't feeling so well. So I'm thinking that MAYBE I might hurl or something of the sort so I just go lay down in the bathroom... just in case. You guys know how nasty it is to clean up that stuff. Well, for about an hour and a half I'm just laying there and I'm like... okay maybe my stomach is just upset. But I'm a cautious person and was going to put my trashcan next to my bed.... well it was full so I settled for a towel. Thank goodness for that towel. That is all I'm going to say. I don't think I could've aimed for the trashcan anyway.  Well today my plans have been ultimately ruined! My sister and I were going to go down to the beach for the day and do some SHOPPIN! But that doesn't look like it's going to happen. And then David and I might have gone out tonight... that wasn't definite, but it was a hope. Now, that might could still happen. Because sometimes these things come and go... but I don't think so.  Now everywhere I go in my house there is some type of food item. That is no good.

      Okay, first day of exams, I'm okay now. Once I get into the whole thing I'm all good.  So I had Env. Science today which went pretty average but on that exam I didn't care too much. I know that my grade is still the same and I'm happy with that. Then there's english and I REALLY needed to good on that exam. And I'm happy to report that I'm pretty sure that I did okay. Now... on the essay that was 40% of my grade, which I handed in on friday, I'm not sure how I did on that. So we will see.  You guys, this is so sad! All the seniors are leaving... oh, how terribly tragic. I'm going to cry... except not really because the ones that I actually care about, I'm going to see again... sooooooooo. Or at least I plan to see again. Or at least I have the means to see them. Yah... that sounds good.

      According to Sean... there is no other way to describe me then Sexy Muffin. I must admit I'm not too objective too the name. Although, it would be a tad bit odd if I walked down the hall and people started calling me that. Funny but strange.  Only one more week of school! Yeah... than we're out for the summer! But I can't wait for tomorow. Elaina and I are going to her house to go swimming in her pool. I love Elaina, she is cool. Apparently we're also supposed to be studying... who knows about that one.   Then on Tuesday I'm getting my hair done for real this time. It's going to look good. I think... I hope. And I would like to just say that Lauren Dicaccio (I hope I spelled that right)got the coolest hair cut. Now I want to cut my hair. For those of you who dont' know her just take my word for it and if you do... you should worship her now because I know I do.

      Because I haven't written in awhile and I really don't have time to do it tonight either... I'm going to do the topic that we Jeremy H. and I were talking about.   The Issue of Washing Heads and Scalps...   Tori: I have a squishy scalp Jeremy: squishy maby you should get that checked out Tori: see, from working in a salon i've realized that there are many types of heads and scalps Jeremy: Let's discuss heads Tori: there's they type that doesn't fit in the bowl ... those are really hard to wash because it's hard to get the hose around to their hair; then there's the head that's too small so water easily runs down their backs; then there's the heads that move a lot and it's hard to wash becuase it's like you're finger is slipping in their ear or up their nose;  then there's the heads that fall asleep and don't have any movement at all and those are hard because they tend to be very heavy heads; Desire 596: and then there's the heads that are perfect Jeremy: okay now... let's describe scalps Desire 596: and when you are washing the hair it's like your fingers are digging into some mud or something Jeremy: what does that mean? Tori: well... not really that deep Jeremy: like it pushes in or soemthing Tori: but... like.. the top layer, it just... sinks Jeremy: so squishy is good Tori: and then their is the scalp that has like... no hair on it... or very thin hair and it's hard and it's hard to wash hair becuase it's just weird Tori: and then there are the scalps that have endless bumps and nicks to them and it's like you're washing mountains and valleys and you begin to wonder if that's normal; then there are the scalps that have no hair... and you're really confused on what you're supposed to wash... and the scalp is bleeding in places and you're just confused and not sure what to do and you want to throw up when you touch it... I had to wash that scalp today... it was unpleasent Jeremy: oh man gross Jeremy: thats dangerouse Jeremy: a bleeding scalp Jeremy: what this teaches me is to never got to a spa becuase if i do the person who was washing my hair is going to describe my scalp to other people

      Wow, as I sit here and think about what I did today nothing comes to mind. I'm not even sure what I did.... oh wait, nevermind here it comes. I must admit, it's much more fun not remembering what you did and be frusturated about it then knowing what you did do. Especially when it was boring.  I got to clean children's toys today because they were dirty.   I should go to bed. I really should. It's so hard to move my butt from down here to up there. I need a device that will get me up there... like a floating chair, with rockets on the back. That'd be great. You know... 80mph down the highway in an old wooden chair, that would be awesome. Okay, bed time. Here we go. *vroom vroom*

      Yeah, so the chorus concert was tonight. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great either. David was SO sad because it was his last concert, I think I saw him cry in our last song. Oh, how cute!  But afterwards was a lot of fun. A bunch of us went out to baskin robins and then we had some FUUUUn with chalk. Yeah that's right, chalk. Alright bubs, later... a mosquito just flew up my nose.. ew.

So, we have our chours concert for tomorow but I don't think we're going to do very well. You guys shouldn't come and see us, it's not worth it. But afterwards we're all going out to Krispy Kreme...so you should come to that, b/c that'll be fun! If you want to come... just show up! Even if we DONT' know you! Yay!

      Okay... I'm going to respond to what Angela wrote on ..... you can read it... here at  urlLink Angela's Blog   Okay, Well... I'm going to have to disagree with what Angela said. Yes, there are a lot of guys out there that are total asses and we should rid the world of them. But I think the real problem is the girls. See, in these days girls generally go for the jocky, good-looking, popular, out-going, guy. We tend to ignore the other guys that don't fit that "perfect" description. Well, there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that guys like that tend to get a big head because so many girls go after them. Therefore they think they can treat girls however they want because there is someone to replace them.  Now, I have to say there are a lot of gentlmen out there. The only reason we dont' notice them is because they ARE gentlemen, and they don't come up and hit on you, they're not loud and in your face, and they're more reserved about who them are. I think if girls just took the time to actually LOOK for a guy instead of just standing there hoping someone will walk up to them... then we're more likely to get what we want. Because guys most def. do not appear out of thin air, you have to work for them. I should know... David and I were not an easy set of people to get together. We went through hell.   But anyway, Angela... i'm not saying you're wrong (except you are! haha) I just disagree.

      Oh, how I hate pain.  Yesterday at church I had to go home because I had a major break down. Luckily my dad is my teacher and he was leaving early so I came back from the bathroom all red-puffy and crying saying we needed to leave. So he took me home with no questions asks. He's learned that whenever I'm crying and grabbing my back, it's best not to ask but instead just listen and do.   So, today I woke up and was in pain so daddy just let me sleep in and when I woke up I went to school. Ah, I love it when my dad is the only one home... he doesn't argue with me when I mention the "p" word. Well, i'm going to go now. Bye!

      Okay, so honestly I just wanted to not update for awhile and not feel guilty about it. I also didn't want people to bother me about updating.   So, tonight is my brother's Court of Honor... for those who don't know what that is... It's for when a boy scout gets his Eagle and it's just the ceremony for it. They announce to everyone who comes what he's accomplished and blah blah blah. All those things. That's one of the only good things Nathan is going to be able to put on his college applications... I earned my Eagle.   So tomorow my sister is coming home and I've come to the realization that I actually don't hate her (that much) anymore. She's okay when she stopped trying to put me down all the time. That's okay, I guess everybody grows up someday. But tomorow is her wedding shower and then on friday we're going to the beach. Yay! Beach, and since it's only the girls we're going to go shopping at Forever21! I'm so happy, they need one of those stores up in these parts. Although I am glad that they are building an Old Navy right next to the Super Target behind the mall... that should be fantastic!  But for now I've got to go set up for the thing tonight.

      Oh geez guys...today was such a blast let me tell you! I didn't think I could get in anymore trouble but obviously I could.   It started out just wonderful with my mom complaining that I hadn't been home for a week so I was going to work extra hard. Not like I was at church camp or anything. Then my parents decide to call me down into my dads office to have a 'chat'. Geez, I got really excited then. I was hoping that I was getting a car for my birthday... but sadly my parents don't love me enough for that.   My parents decided to ask me why I hated the family so much and well I wouldn't anwser them. In fact, I barely talked at all and I didn't really pay much attention to them. My dad finally got really pissed off and cussed me out and then yelled at me and called me a damn liar. Of course, that's right... I'm such a horrible liar because I didn't wear a sweater over my prom dress. I'm the devil, that's right.  Oh yeah... I'm grounded from everything except going to work. Don't bother trying to do things with me... it won't work out.

      So I'm back from camp. Whoop-dee-do... I wish I was still there instead of this hell hole.  Today was my birthday and I just had the MOST WONDERFUL DAY! When I woke up my mother came into my room yelling at me about how I was going to make them all late to church. Then I went to church and we all know how much I love going there. When I came home my mother decided that because I'm such a horrible child she'd go looking through my room for things to get me in trouble with. So she found some pictures where I was wearing a tank top and my prom dress without a sweater! Oh HEAVEN FORBID! I'm such a horrible child. So she yelled at me for that.   Later that night my friend Becca called. She lives with my sister out in Utah and she had a question to ask me. It had something to do with the rent and some stuff that was my sisters fault. She asked me what to do and I basically told her to tell my sister to fuck off and that she can take her shit and shove it back up herself. Well my mother overheard my conversation and pulled me into the room with my dad so they could yell at me and tell me that I should stick up for my sister. They apparently didn't like it when I told them that I didn't like my sister so why would I stick up for her when she's a bitch. And of course my parents didn't believe me when I told them that Katharine was such a bitch to me when I was a kid.   And you want to know what I got for my birthday? I got a bag to carry my make-up in when I go places. Oh joy... that's so useful because I travel so much.  Happy Birthday to me... I just love everyone right now.

      This was a  long, long  day  I woke up and eventually went to work at 10:00, got off work at 1:30 and had my underarms waxed, man oh man that hurt! Then Sandi and I had to do a bunch of camp stuff.  So for the past 3 hours I've been working on my devotional cards for my 'kids' at camp. Now I've come to the realization that I also have to help 1st years do their certification. It also doesn't help that the overall Camp Leader loves Sandi and I because we're outgoing... now she expects even MORE from us! I'm about to cry!  But, I'm thinking of getting rid of this blog. I mean... it's not changing anyone's life by reading this. And I'm horrible at updating it. I don't know... maybe I'm being silly and would cry if I deleted it. WHO KNOWS!

      So I was into this whole posting everyday thing. But then David came over yesterday UN-INVITED, I may add. So he didn't leave til late and then it was totally bed time for me (10:30).   So next week is camp and I'm halfway excited halfway "Oh good gracious why am i doing this?" But yesterday at work I lied and said I had a doctor's appointment inbetween 2 and 4... but in reality me and my mom went shopping. Only for camp though so it wasn't too terribly exciting. They told us not to bring food because they have a racoon problem. I solved the problem by bringing enough for him and me.   But man oh man, I'm going to have like the BIGGEST farmers tan out of this thing. Since we all know that I'm Mormon (not that I like it or anything...) and we all know that Mormons have INSANELY high standards (which I don't follow...) so basically we have to wear knee-length shorts and t-shirts. Me and Sandi are going to be in hell.   I think I might try to be get sent home. Ah... the stories that I have from camp. I think that for the past 5 years I've been threatened to be sent home every time. Sadly, they never went through with it because it wasn't a punishment for me. Oh well, I'm a counseler this year and therefore I don't have to do anything. I think me and Sandi will go sink another canoe... that was entertaining.

      Technology really gets to me sometimes. It's amazing, wonderful and all of the above but sometimes I just think its too much. Mainly because I don't understand it and I get awfully frustrated sometimes. But right now, nobody is helping me and I really want to scream! Or I could go for a nice shopping trip but my mother said NO! And all I want is basketball shorts for camp.   I've decided that even thought I'm keeping my other Journal it is OKAY to have a blog also. Not that many of you care because I'm sure you could deal without this. But it gives me a reason to be on the computer, or to ignore people while i'm on the computer. Like when someone is trying to talk to me... I can be like "hey, I'm updating my blog so sorry, I can't talk right now"   I probally shouldn't have told you that. But since we all know that things written in blogs are PERMANENT as soon as they are typed out... i'll leave it up there or maybe because my backspace key is broken. You take a guess, I'll leave it up to you.

      So, Utah was awesome and everything but I was really looking forward to coming home. I mean, my own bed, my own bathroom, my own closet, my own room, my own everything! I was just so excited. Everything was going to be wonderful. I was going to go get all my summer reading done. I was going to go shopping for things for my room. I was giong to hang out with friends. I was going to go quit my job and apply to 10 billion others. I was just ready to move on and get some things done. Then I got home.   Apparently while we were gone my cat decided to lay down in the sink and plug it up. Then he turns on the water. For probally 24 hours we had water running out of the sink... from my room. There goes my own bathroom, my own bedroom, my own closet... My room has been completely destroyed. Caroline's room has been completely destroyed. The family room has been completely destroyed. The garage has been completely destroyed. So the construction workers have come and they have taken all the carpet out of my bedroom, they have taken out all of my bathroom floor. And they've cleaned out the other rooms but who cares about them. MY room is important here.   Actually, I'm not too bummed. Life is life and you've just got to understand that things are going to happen and there's not much you can do about it. So, I'm just living it up and having friends come over to entertain me. By the way, if you have a house I can spend the night at... that would be wonderful. Because we have all these fans going on in the house that makes it impossible to sleep. I slept at Elaina's last night and we had a blast just being ourselves.   So anyway... I have to be at my house while the construction guys are here. There's this really hott one that I'm having fun checking out. Oh yeah, he's a fine specimen of a man. But anyway... oh here he comes. GOT TO GO!

So he told me some things and I'm glad he did. I know you can't change your outlook on life in an hour conversation. But it can make you think about changing it. So glad we had that talk.

      So, just another day in "funtah" or Utah... take your choice.   I went shopping with my mom, my sisters and my little cousin. We had to get some last minute things for Katherine's wedding. Honeslty.. it was really not that much fun. Then we went to Cafe Rio... it's THE BEST mexican grill you can ever go to. Honestly... it's awesome. If ya'll are ever out in Utah... look it up and go no matter how far it is. It's def. worth it. The only problem is no matter what time of day... it's insanely busy.   Then later we went to go visit my grandma at the nursing home. That was way heart breaking. My grandma's been ill for quite sometime. And it was just really hard seeing her in that condition. But she's still an awesome grandma. I'm so glad that she's going to be able to see the first grandkid to be married.   Well, tonight I'm going to hang out with my friend becca who is going to BYU right now. She'll be picking me up as soon as she calls me. Later Gators.

      Well guys I'm in Utah now on my Uncle Dusty's computer. He was so kind to leave the house so I could sneak on. Nah, he's let me use it anyway.  Well the plane ride wasn't that bad. None of those Australian mans that were drunk and started to touch me. Then we got in and we came to my grandpa's house. Which is where I am now.  I've done nothing but eat popsicles and a sandwish. Yeah! Hopefully tomorow will be more fun.  &nbsp;

      So, it surprises me that the whole neighborhood knows us. I didn't know that til today. Honestly, I was walking around the neighborhood today because I was bored and I took Zeus, my dog, on a walk. Well, everywhere we went everyone kept saying "hey Zeus! How are you doggy?!" or something along those lines. So, maybe they don't know us... they just know our dog.  &nbsp; Well, tomorow morning at 8:30 we leave for the airport to go to Utah. My sister's wedding is on friday and so I'll be out there til the 27th. But my parents won't be home til the 2nd... PARTY AT MY HOUSE. Or not... all of you stay far away from this residence. It's seen one too many parties that have been busted by the cops. Garrett... how you defiled this house. No, i'm kidding! Well, i'm not kidding about the cops thing. But ya'll are welcome to come over.  &nbsp; Well, i'm going to go play with my cat... and pack. Later!

But other then that... nothing much else happened today. I talked to my friend Becca. &nbsp; I started packing for utah just a couple mintues ago because we're leaving on tuesday. And apparently I've planned things wtih about 4 different people for tomorow. Geez, I don't know what I'm going to do.

       urlLink    So my brother, Garrett, is the one without the police uniform on. This pictures makes me laugh because you have no idea how funny it is that he's FRIENDS with police officers. Considering his past. &nbsp; urlLink

      Okay, so sorry about all the picutures. I just figured out how to use the Hello program. It is SO easy. Wow, I'm SO stupid that I couldn't figure it out. So... I'm not going to create a photo blog. I'm just going to put them on here because... 1) I'm lazy 2) I don't care THAT much 3) Why? (okay, so 3 might not make sense to you, but it def. makes sense to me) &nbsp; So, yesterday was a whole bunch of fun. Nathan came over to my house around 3 and we went to brusters, the mall, target and best buy. The first three becasue I'm trying to switch jobs and I wanted to get a job application at those places. We went to best buy because I'm looking to buy a digital camera and I wanted to go check them out and I was just looking at all of them. But at Target I bought Jelly belly's because they're awesome and Nathan got the Polyphonic Spree CD. He was very excited. &nbsp; Then we went out to Olive Garden and ate. But there was a 20 minute wait. So we passed the time by going over to the carlot and looking at the cars and guessing the prices. We got bored with that and then we went over to olive garden and I made a tic tac toe board out of rocks. I think he won. Then we took off my shoe and tried to throw rocks in it. Some stranger joined in which, was really funny, and he was nice. So we went in and the waiter was really nice. But Nathan was convinced that he called him a girl. I think that the waiter said something like "and for your girl" (I am NOT Nathan's girl) but Nathan was very convinced that the man had called him a girl. But the next two times he called him sir, and my man. But even then, Nathan said that he was just saying that because he noticed that he WAS&nbsp; guy and felt bad. No, Nathan.. you are wrong.  &nbsp; After dinner we went to go see I, ROBOT because we both really wanted to see that. And it was an AWESOME MOVIE. Really, you guys... this movie is not dissapointing at all. You should all go see it and support Will Smith... not that he needs support. Actually... support me and drop off money in my mail box in an envelope that has Tori written on it. But really, go see the movie. It's great. I kept on distracting Nathan though because his hair was just so tempting so I HAD to play with it. Mwa hahaha, he'll have to see the movie ALL over again.

      We've all read those things were certain packages contain certain funny phrases. Such as...   On a Swedish chain saw -- "Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals."  &nbsp; I thought that I'd share that with you because... obviously something happened that made it so they had to add that one in. &nbsp; Also, I'd like to point out that while I was at work I was reading the newspaper. I tried very hard but realized that I wasn't in it. Everyday I've realized that the world does not deem me important enough to be in the newspaper. Somehow... that's oddly comforting.

      Last night I went to update my blog and blogger was NOT WORKING! I was so completly and utterly frusturated and didn't know what to do. So I sat down and cried for awhile before I realized that something needed to be done. So first I called the website and complained but the person said that I needed to write a letter of complaint to some address. Well I did! Then I lost the address!  Or that's what would've happened if I cared that much.  But this is REALLY what happened last night. I went over to Cliff's apartment to play Halo and poker with all the guys. But I forgot that I didn't have any money so I just sad beside/on top of Marco and helped him with his hand. But Megan came so we had a glorious time proving to all the guys why girls rule... just not at video games.   Then I came home, and realized blogger wasn't working and then preceeded to go to bed.

      How long have you been waiting? Me... I can't remember when I wasn't. Someone told me that if I wait long enough he'll come. "Who is he?" I asked. They said I would know.  So I've sat patiently like they've told me to. I've sat through the rain and the snow. Days have passed and still I've waited. People have walked by and I hoped they were for me... they weren't. I'm still alone.  I'm starting to wonder if they were wrong. Maybe the person I'm waiting for is waiting for me. Maybe I'm supposed to be out there looking for him. But what if I leave? Maybe he'll pass by and I'll have missed my chance? But if I don't take a risk, I might be sitting here forever...alone.  So I stand up and look around. The place I've known forever is the place i'm going to leave. I turn around for one last glance and then with a smile I turn and leave. And there he is, the "him" I've been waiting for. And all I had to do was take a chance.  So, how long have you been waiting?    I don't remember when I wrote this... but i just found it and I thought it was pretty cool. I don't think it was meant towards anyone, I think I was just writing.

      This is why you should go to Flash Fiction... the one under my blog links because he writes FUNNY things!   As a child, Duncan Peregrine had been observed carefully by his parents and teachers. His constant talking to himself seemed to indicate some sort of mental instability. What he was unable to ever convincingly explain to them was that he possessed the unique ability to hear the narration in the story of his life. He tried to get used to it, but it often got on his nerves.                  Look, no one cares; will you just shut up? Duncan snapped at the narration. What do you mean snapped at the narration? Of course thats who I was talking to. You think I was talking to these people?                  Sorry, the narration was just trying to do its job. The others in the waiting room looked up at Duncan, confused.                   Let em look.                  The woman next to him coughed nervously and stared intently at the magazine in her hands. Duncan flipped through a magazine of his own, but couldnt concentrate enough to read it. He imagined it was the fact that all his actions were constantly being narrated for him inside his head. He wished the narration would just go away for a while, at least during the time Duncan was in the doctors office.                  So why dont you go for a while, if you know I want you to? he asked. Everyone in the waiting room desperately pretended not to hear him.                  Fine, the narration answered.                  Did you just narrate yourself?                  The narration got a little carried away, is all.                  Look, just go, Duncan said.                  Okay, okay. The narration left, and silence returned to the waiting room.                  Duncan went back to flipping through his magazine.                  I said go!                  Fine; the narrations going...

      Okay honestly now... I swear I'll start updating now. All thanks to my good pal Elaina. I helped her with her blog last night so she could actually update and read it. So from now on, I swear!  Today we went to the lake and it was AWESOME! Oh my gosh, it ruled! Elaina, Angela, Nathan L., Jackson, Jeremy, Emily and Eric came. And I'm so excited because i'm the one who planned it and everything worked out perfectly. But me and angela were having all these crazy competitions. Then Angela, Eric and I all swam across the lake to the other side so Eric could pee. Great times guys. We had food and all sorts of fun. Then me and Nathan went diving off the dock and my bottoms weren't staying on too well. But we had fun.   After the lake Elaina, Angela, Nathan and Eric came back to my house. We just chilled for awhile and watched some tv. Then I had to give everyone a back and head massage. Which was okay because Nathan gave me one later... he needs practice. That's okay I accepted it. Then Eric left and then Angela. Then the three of us ate corn, pizza, and cinnamon sticks. Then we played 20 questions. Wow, that was entertaining. Except Nathan kept getting them like on the first clue... But he DIDN'T GET JOHN MUIR!   Well, i'm off to bed soon enough because I have church tomorow. Then I'm going to the lake again on Monday I think... or not. I'm not sure if I want to go again so soon. Goodnight folks
