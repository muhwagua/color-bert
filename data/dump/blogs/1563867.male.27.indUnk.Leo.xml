       On Frugality   by Woody Allen     As one goes through life, it is extremely important to conserve funds, and one should never spend money on anything foolish, like pear nectar or a solid gold hat.  Money is not everything, but it is better than having one's health.  After all, one cannot go into a butcher shop and tell the butcher, "Look at my great suntan, and besides I never catch colds," and expect him to hand over any merchandise.  Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons.  Not that it can buy happiness.  Take the case of the ant and the grasshopper: The grasshopper played all summer, while the ant worked and saved.  When winter came, the grasshopper had nothing, but the ant complained of chest pains.  Life is hard for insects.  And don't think mice are having any fun, either.  The point is, we all need a nest egg to fall back on, but not while wearing a good suit.

       Six:  Prostrated punditry      And so it was that I found myself in the improbable embrace of romance, dear friends, viewing war coverage in bed with a date!  So what if the embrace was initially my own--a nervous reaction to doing anything in bed with a date?  Surely the chances were good that someone would join me soon, and with both arms, or both legs, depending on the arrangement.  If ever there was a payoff to the ease of internet dating--three months of intensive correspondence, exorbitant phone bills, and the anxiety you would be bound and kidnapped; or, even worse, that you wouldn't--this had to be it!  "It looks like we're winning the war, shminky.  It's not easy though.  Leon says the Iraqis aren't fighting fair."  "Did he just say they're hiding weapons instead of leaving them in the armories where they're easier to destroy?"  "I think so.  They're also firing at us and then hiding behind things when we shoot back.  They won't face us in the desert like men."   "They truly are a dastardly race of people.  Don't they know our bombs are only there to help?  Why do they have to resort to terrorism all the time, blowing themselves up hither and thither; why can't they just fight fair--with jets and tanks and naval destroyers?"  "Blowing yourself up is so passé."    "There's no bravery in it anymore.  Bravery is manning the controls at a safe distance."  "Well, at least Saddam Hussein won't be flying planes into buildings ever again.  Consider your pilot's license permanently revoked!"  "Har!"      "This only underscores our benevolence as a superpower, that we would care so deeply for the needs of these backwards people."  "I know I never cared about them until now."  "Look!  Leon says we even provide medical care to the wounded, orphaned children of our enemies!  I mean, we don't even do that for the wounded, orphaned children in our country!"  "We don't even do that for the healthy, non-orphaned children in our country!"    "Clearly, sudden, extreme violence will usher in a new era of liberal prosperity for these people."

       Five:  De Oppresso Liber        "Well, here's to Hudson Hotel thinking of everything," Maureen said, wine in hand.    "Yes, and to victory in the Middle East...at least, for somebody."  "Yes, to victory.  And liberation.  Don't forget that."  "Of course.  Liberation."  "Military or otherwise."    "This Sam Adams needs liberation."  "My career needs liberation."  "I need to be liberated out of my tax bracket."  "You need to be liberated out of those pants."  "You'll never get UN approval."    "Then I'll just have to go it alone, won't I?"    "Can I watch?"  "Hey, you're the boy, aren't you?  You're the pace car.  Why am I doing all the work?"  "Oh, okay... Well, why don't you step out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini?"    "What wet clothes?"  "Step out of those dry clothes, then."  Maureen laughed, "and into what?"  "That's immaterial."    "That's not a very convincing argument."  "I'm the pace car, remember?  If I'm going make all the advances you have to do your part, too."  "I am!" Maureen said indignantly.  "My job is to resist your advances!"  "You never told me that!"  "Of course, snoopy!  Don't you know how these things work?  The boys fight each other for the girl and the girl holds out for the best genes."  "Let's not talk about my pants."   Maureen rolled her eyes.  "You and your monkiness!  Listen, I want to help.  Look at the monks, they wear beautiful saffron silk robes and carry cell phones.  The pope has all of his robes and vestments hand tailored by the finest tailors from, I don't know, Milan.  And his shoes, well, an Italian man wouldn't be caught dead in cheap footwear."    "Great.  I'm competing with the Pope."   "Or take Calvin Klein.  His aesthetic is monastic.  But he uses the most luxurious fabrics and other materials.  So there's hope for your unmaterialistic soul yet."  "If you're really going to resist we're never going to get anywhere.  I can only pretend to be clever for so long."  Maureen considered.  "You know, it's really very selfish of us to be going on about our own affairs when there is such turmoil in the world tonight."  "Yes!" I declared.  "Let's let the turmoil of the world distract us from our own.  We don't even know the current score, or whether U2 will be performing at half-time."    "I'm sure Leon will inform us of everything worth knowing.  We'll have a much better view of the television from the bed, no?"  "Verily, verily, my dear.  A capital idea."

       Part Four:  A Curious Riddle      The suite itself was very nice, and easy enough to traverse.  A bed was plainly visible, as well as a loveseat, coffee table, and television.  An office area consisted of a small glass table and chair.  The bathroom was an enormous space, with one self-illuminating mirror, toilet and shower.  Interestingly enough, the shower was not physically distinct--it boasted neither stall nor basin--and instead simply presented itself on one wall of the room.  Maureen explained to me the luxury of space in New York City, but still I insisted on knowing how the water from the shower did not end up beneath the sink.    After some deliberation, I contrived a protected position on the loveseat, with my hat serving as an ad hoc waist-level buffer.   I resolved not to make eye-contact with the bed until absolutely necessary.  Maureen joined me, fully female and now ordering drinks.  Was I thirsty?  Yes, I am fond of beer.  Juice, maybe, only don't add too much juice.  Water is best, just be sure put the scotch in first.  When the room service arrived I hid behind a partition, which I now regard as particularly foolish, as it only prompted Maureen to ask, "Why are you hiding behind the partition?  I want you to meet someone."  I was summarily introduced to a Hawaiian, if you can imagine--one of Maureen's subordinates from the restaurant of the hotel.  The Hawaiian was a friendly-enough fellow, and not entirely unsympathetic to the chance of finding his boss alone in a room with a person of questionable income.  He would return later with more drinks and a complimentary gift from the restaurant staff: a Hotel Hudson intimacy kit.  In retrospect this Hawaiian understood my predicament better than I did.  Neither money nor occasion have I had to purchase such a device in years.

       Part Three:  A Harrowing Journey   "Don't you love it, scallop?" Maureen asked me, two room keys and several elaborate lies later.  "This is where I work.  Isn't it dreamy?  Over-designed and painfully hip."    "I feel like I'm not appreciating this to my $400-a-night fullest.  What is that?  Some kind of dance music?  Where are we anyway?"  "This is the elevator, dear."  "Why is there dance music in the elevator?  What's that green halo around everything?  Why can't I see my feet?"  "That's the Ian Schrager difference."  "$400 a night so I can't see where I'm going?"  Maureen laughed.  "Quit cryin', Rye-anne.  You love it."     A wall receded before us and after several steps and some examination I satisfied the impression that we were no longer in the elevator.  Maureen was advancing along a narrow corridor, interminable in length, her eyes no doubt better acclimated to the overpriced gloam.  Despite my relative blindness I kept pace as best I could, rarely discerning a floor but rather a succession of lights suspended from either wall, not unlike the landing strip of a runway.  These met me in clusters as I walked, and the intervals produced a familiar enough effect: we were in among a long arrangement of private rooms, proceeding to our own.    "Christ, will you slow down," I gasped, anxious lest I speak too loudly and disturb, well, whatever the hell might be molting down here in middle-earth.  Maureen materialized and guided me by the hand, which is by far my best appendage to be led by, although I still held out hope this would not spoil the evening.  "Hurry, hurry, your royal boyness," Maureen chided, "the last thing I need is for my boss to find me marshaling men into rooms at discount rates.  My boss is an oompa loompa from the chocolate factory.  He has one of the sourest temperaments known to man, even too sour to make their famous oompa loompa sour balls.  He is a little man:  Little hands, little nasally voice, little hair, little teeny feet, little closed mind--closed shut like a little mouse trap, it is!!  Why, even his heart is little, but little does he care."

       A Man for all Treasons: Part Two      Wartime advantage or no, I immediately made haste to apologize for a variety of personal shortcomings my date--we will call her Maureen--would doubtless recognize in the coming hours. My sunglasses, for instance, were far too stylish, and I feared being mistaken for someone too eager to make a good impression. My pants, as I have already made mention, were a kind of elaborate rag suspended from my hips which I had hoped to conceal as best I could with my large hat; but I soon realized this strategy worked best in a seated position that I could not easily reproduce while walking.  I apologized for my vulnerability to the sun and my constant consumption of water and hourly lavatory constraints. Mercy on Maureen, was woman before ever so be-pelted with regrets! "Stop doing that, will you?" she finally told me. "You're fine."   For some time we walked about the city, avoiding a variety of topics, and making our way to the Hudson Hotel (pronounced "Hudson Hotel"--the article is silent).  The reader may well question the wisdom in booking a hotel room on the first date, and I must confess a certain degree of trepidation regarding the matter myself. But soon I felt very selfish indeed: if soldiers can so bravely answer the call of war then surely I too can be-bed unfamiliar females. I considered the bravest souls of Operation Iraqi Freedom--anyone under attack from the US military--and decided that I had it easy. And besides, Maureen had a crazy discount.      Suffice it to say I have never experienced a hotel so uniquely odd and ostentatiously expensive as Hudson Hotel.  Maureen had to assure me that I would not be forcibly removed from the establishment at a moments notice, so convinced was I to be tromping beyond the privileges of my caste. "Just make sure they know you're with me," she explained. But this proved difficult even for Maureen: when consulting a front desk co-worker about checking in, so untenable was the premise that she had reserved a room for me in her name that the general manager, a large German, was summoned to sort out the whole mess.

       A Man for all Treasons: Part One        As a part-time laborer garnering little more than $10,000 a year, it is not often I find myself in the welcome company of modern females.  It is sometimes said that a man of my position would find himself better matched as companion to the less discriminating--say, pigeon or ox--than endeavoring to impress an American woman on character alone, with no means to secure an evening of motion pictures or automobile riding.  To this end I have found the internet an invaluable tool in concealing my basic impropriety and allowing me to behave very much as a man experienced in courting females.  Most recently, my efforts brought me to New York's Hudson Hotel, where I had for some time been corresponding with an employee whom I found to be convincingly female on all subjects.  My sojourn in New York was to coincide with the opening  remarks of Operation Iraqi Freedom--a moving occasion by any standard--and I anticipated a weekend spent in the throes of patriotic rapture, or unpatriotic rapture, depending on who was winning.  Be that as it may, and because my companion and I were only meeting for the very first time, I suggested a policy of restraint, to which my friend counter-suggested a policy of restraints, to which I departed for New York ten hours early and in possession of little more than dental floss and a wide-brimmed hat.      Always harbouring a deep love of humanity, it is not often I allow my affection to be tested by venturing outside the confines of my home.  My bus ride into New York was neither splendid nor without incident; I recall a bus filled with Chinese, and myself acting as the nucleus for an oasis of white college students.  As one can expect, each race enjoyed liberal use of their cell phones; but insofar as I do not understand Chinese, I was very sorry to be seated amongst my peers.   When I arrived in New York, war had begun.  CNN anchor Leon Harris, scarcely human under his trademark mask of cosmetics, beamed enthusiasm in announcing the start of "another desert war!"  Such was the bedlam that I felt myself distinctly at an advantage: surely my companion would be more invested in the offenses of Saddam Hussein than the offenses, personal and financial, of her date.  The truth was better than I could have expected:  When we finally met she said to me, "That Leon is a waste of perfectly good affirmative action."  I was taken by the hand with no mention of the hole in my pant leg.

       Rumsfeld:  Freedom, Belgian courts, are untidy    In 1998 the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a treaty authorizing a permanent international court for war crimes. The United States, China, and five other nations opposed the treaty, and 21 nations abstained. The treaty has been signed by more than 130 nations (including the United States), and formally came into effect in July, 2002, when the court was established. Called the International Criminal Court and located at The Hague, it may prosecute war crimes, genocide,  urlLink crimes of aggression , and crimes against humanity. Under the G. W. Bush administration, the United States opposed implementation of the treaty, out of fear that American officials or military personnel might be arrested abroad on baseless charges. In May, 2002, the United States repudiated its signing of the treaty and indicated that it would refuse to cooperate with the court; it subsequently insisted that U.S. forces used as UN peacekeepers be exempted prosecution by the court.( urlLink 1 )    urlLink Belgium indicts US with war crimes in Iraq, Rumsfeld mad    urlLink Why American officials should be exempted from international law    urlLink US war crimes from Gulf War I    urlLink Interview with former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark on American militarism and international law

       Why did we go to war?   This is the best my co-workers and I can figure out:  If we find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, then it will have been about weapons of mass destruction.  If we don't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, then it will have been about something else.  "We didn't lie," one Bush official told ABCnews, "it was just a matter of emphasis."  In other words, the war will ultimately be about whatever we want it to be about, and we'll let you know once we've made up our minds.        So much of this is right out of George Orwell's 1984.  In fact, because 1984 is so often associated with state totalitarianism, we don't usually apply it to propaganda systems in democratic societies, which are usually much more sophisticated and convincing.  When the only news source in a country is government controlled, people know well enough to discount what they're hearing.  This was how I always viewed Orwell's Oceania--a kind of clumsy, Soviet-style system, holding a bludgeon over people's heads lest they fall out of line.  (Having re-read 1984 again recently, I think there's more to it than this, but I will leave that aside for the moment.)  It's not as interesting in terms of propaganda because the propaganda isn't as good.  If you want to see propaganda that people can invest themselves in, you have to look to the free societies.  What's been interesting to me about the Iraq war, however, is just how unsophisticated the propaganda has been.  Orwell's Oceania had a proclivity to declare itself at war with one country one day, only to turn around and deny it the next:  it had really been at war with someone else.  The intellectual class--writers, editors, teachers, archivists--were assigned the task of destroying official records not keeping with current government declarations, and to rewrite history according to the new narrative.  The government of Oceania relied on its population being so beat-down and apathetic, and their attention span so limited, that they wouldn't remember, or wouldn't care to remember, that just yesterday they were at war with a totally different enemy.  The purpose of war was simply a means to control the population, keep them afraid, and provide justification for their detainment or execution if they stepped out of line, thus becoming 'enemy combatants,' to borrow a term from our current administration and its Patriot Act legislation.    Normally I would consider our society above so crude a means of persuasion, but in the case of WMD's, it's practically right off the pages of Orwell's most famous novel.  Our administration sends us to war because of the 'imminent threat' we face from Iraq and their weapons program.  That's what they sold the war on, remember, not liberating Iraqis or giving a shot to the arm of Middle East peace.  Iraq has 'tens of thousands' of tons of weapons, and so on and so forth.  Blair tells his people Saddam could prep a warhead with bio-chem weapons in 45 minutes.  Most of this is never verified, who knows where this information is coming from, but people begin to accept, yes, Hussein is our greatest threat.  So we lay waste to the country, its communities, its infrastructure, kill a lot of people, some good, some bad, some theirs, some ours--and now we can't find any weapons.  2 months of searching and zilch.  Tens of thousands of tons of materials, and we can't find a goddam firecracker.  Now it comes out, well, the whole war wasn't really about WMD's after all.  My supervisor is saying, "I could have told you that."  Of course, the war wasn't about  that !  And suddenly I am surrounded by experts in the affairs of state and foreign policy, who understood this all along.    Are we really that apathetic and distracted not to notice that we went to war for one reason and came out of it going to war for another--any other--reason?  Christ almighty.  Stop watching The Matrix and start paying attention to the matrix around you.

       On-line dating      We all know that if it weren't for the internet, I wouldn't have scored a date with a woman in the last four years.  Some will argue that such single-minded reliance on technology for companionship is a sad testament to the alienation of the individual and the breakdown of civil society in the modern era.  To these people I say:  No one else has gone so far, done so much, or risen so high with so pitiful little.  In the blogs to come I intend to outline some of my most objectionable forays into the world of digital dalliance.  But in today's selection, I offer you my most recent exchange:     From: katriles  To: summerhead  Date: 06/17/2003 04:20PM EST  Subject: summerhead  Message: Hi there! I read your profile and was very impressed. I would love to speak to you if possible...... If you could email me back I would really appreciate it. Have a great day and I look forward to hearing from you!     From: summerhead  To: katriles  Date: 06/17/2003 06:53PM EST  Subject: hello katriles  Message:   Hello Katriles,  Thank you for writing me. I was saddened to see that your profile was blank, and not a picture to be found. As I don't have any information about you I'm feeling at a loss. Maybe you can provide some detail in response, no?  Yours,  Summer   From: katriles  To: summerhead  Date: 06/17/2003 07:01PM EST  Subject: Re: hello katriles  Message:      Summer,    I am so appreciative of your response - and so quickly too! Your profile might just not do you justice! The first bit of information about myself that I feel compelled to reveal (though fear of not receiving another response from you does hold me back a bit)is that I am actually NOT looking for myself right now but on behalf of some incredible women that I know... I can explain more if you are feeling openminded (you seem to be as you ARE on great boyfriends)and interested in meeting great women. First maybe I can invite you to an event that my company is having?? We could then meet in person and talk. On Thursday June 19th we are holding a benefit for the charity MANNA - it's called "Bring on the Bachelors" and the guys who attend have the chance to win a dinner with Gwen, Helene and Erin (picture attached) from the second episode of ABC's tv show the Bachelor - are you familiar with it? If you want to attend you can sign up at http://www.628socialnetwork.com or if you can't and just want to talk you can reach me at 610.355.9628.   Take care and I really do hope to hear from you soon!!  Kate   From: summerhead  To: katriles  Date: 06/17/2003 07:43PM EST  Subject: bated and breathy  Message:   Hi Kate,  Wow! Charities, network television and a chance to win--I don't know what kind of racket you're running, but, damn, it's a good one. I'm just afraid my poor heart won't be able to handle so much excitement on the first date! Ordinarily, raffling for single females is the best chance I have for landing a date; but do we lose in intimacy what we gain in network ratings? Oh, Kate, please assure me! I want to do the right thing--just tell me what that is!  Conflicted,  Ryan     From: katriles  To: summerhead  Date: 06/17/2003 07:48PM EST  Subject: Re: bated and breathy  Message: Ryan,   The right thing for you to do would most assuredly be to attend the charity event. A chance to perhaps win dinner out (you would be with all three women and two other lucky men) with these ladies as well as take a shot at some of the awesome silent auction items that we have to offer OR the free giveaways? There shall never be another opportunity so sweet! Please consider it... If you don't think it the best thing for you - then at least tell me that you will talk to me (or let me talk to you!!) about how we introduce people to one another over dinner at super restaurants...  Peacefully yours,  Kate     From: summerhead  To: katriles  Date: 06/17/2003 08:59PM EST  Subject: 3 girls and 3 guys? I don't like those odds.  Message:  Dear Kate,  This is the most fun I've ever had being solicited--thanks! Bearing that in mind, I recognize that this is your job: I respect your time and I don't want to monopolize it (too much). I'm sure Erin, Helen and Gwen are great (they certainly look it, don't they?), but I worry I might not live up to ABC's standard of bachelordom; I don't inline skate or anything like that.   A-ha! Well, Catherine, it appears you've been found out! You are a representative from the 6[2]8 social network--"an upscale dining and social club." Do you know the last female (she, sadly, was also the first) to proposition me online was a journalist who wanted moi for an "on-camera interview?" Why can't I meet a nice non-professional girl; or better yet a strictly unprofessional girl who won't let her work get in the way of me? But I digress. Catherine, I am not by any stretch of the imagination "upscale." I own approximately two pair of pants; my shirts are so frayed they have tentacles at the cuffs. I'm no good at clubs: I would never want to be in any club that would have someone like me for a member.  I'm sorry dear. I hope this doesn't mean we can't still be friends.  Good luck with everything!  Ryan     True to form, this little e-fling started with a bang and ended in a fizzle.  Kate's average response time was about 7 minutes--at least insofar as I kept my caste position and wardrobe options to myself.  It's taken her over an hour now to let me know about our friendship.  I hope she's just eating dinner.

       The Manufacture of Consent      Why of course the people don't want war ... But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship ... Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.  --Hermann Goering, Nazi leader, at the Nuremberg Trials

       Death Interviews JRB of Souvenir Recordings       Last night I dreamt that I was interviewed by Death about involvement in the Philadelphia-based band Souvenir Recordings.  This is a transcript of the conversation:   Death:  Mr. Boyd, thank you for having me today.  Ryan:  I'm a big fan of your work.  How do you find the time?    Death:  Yes, well, things are busy, you know, all things considered.  But's its getting to the point where we've subcontracted a lot of the work out; for instance the whole Iraq thing:  I told them from the beginning that I wouldn't touch it unless they got me some help this time.  I mean, you had this huge humanitarian crisis before the war even began.  Then Bush says he's going to drop ordnance all over the goddam place; that must have started last September or so, you know, when I started hearing about it.  And so I told them no way.  Africa alone has enough work already; if they want Iraq done right, then they'd better just go on and hire more people.    Ryan:  I guess it worked.  Death:  Yeah, they laid off me a lot.  When it comes down to it they know it's in their own best interest to let me run the show.  But you get these kids from Wharton--you know, Ivy Leaguers--who think they're going to come in and cut costs and slash benefits and turn this into a cash cow.  But that's not the way it works; this isn't the health care system.  Once I raised a stink about it things got better almost immediately.  But enough about me.  How is the band going?  Ryan:  Well, the band is awful, at least in strict musical terms.  We are doing pretty well otherwise.  Death:  How did Souvenir Recordings get started?  Ryan:  I don't know.  We all met.  It's not a great story or anything, and it doesn't really lend any insight into why we're so terrible.    Death:  Okay, next question.  Do you prefer playing in a band or by yourself?  Ryan:  I think neither.     Death:  Do you like playing live?    Ryan:  I do, but only insofar as I really don't.  I feel like I've accomplished something when I do it.      Death:  Who are your influences?     Ryan:  Actually, right now I really admire Sleater Kinney and the girl from Cat Power.  I don't really know anything of their music.  I like who they seem to be as people.  Sleater Kinney work day jobs and seem very down to earth.  The girl from Cat Power talks about her ultimate goal as quitting music and working with kids.  She's so clearly not a part of that world--the industry, the indie scene, everything.  It's really inspiring.      Death:  You haven't heard their music?  Ryan:  I know one SK song, and I love it.  But my impression of them is as some kind of indie-punk, and punk is not my thing.  Cat Power I don't think I know anything.  It's some kind of indie.  But it doesn't matter.  I like that they're approaching everything on their own terms and that's inspiring to me.      Death:  Do you know when SR will be releasing anything?  Ryan:  What a terrible thing to ask!

       Patriotism    Americans answer the call of their nation in different ways.  Today I received notice from an old college friend of his decision to leave a vibrant career in information technology so that he might chart a new course in our nation's military.  For those of you who knew Matt in college, the development should not be entirely surprising.  Here is the body of his letter as he sent it:       Dear friends and family,    In this time of international tension, I have felt the call of my nation in the tears of every child in need of liberation.  With this in mind, I have decided to terminate my employment at Level(3) communications in Denver, CO and seek a position in our nation's military.  Though I have experienced some trepidation about this life change, I think it is the best thing I can do to help make the world a better and safer place.  I have been in contact with an Air Force recruiter, who assures me that there is a new fast-track flight school program that will make use of my personal talents and aptitudes.  I am very interested in a special operations team that looks like it offers some exciting opportunities.      Please do not be concerned about this sudden change; I am approaching this challenge in the best of spirits.  Despite security concerns, I wanted to share w/ you this  urlLink picture of a fellow cadet  on my team who is about to graduate into an "active" combat role.  I'm anxious to join the team, and I look forward to showing the world what American ingenuity can do.   See you in the big blue!   Matt

       Souvenir Recordings   Souvenir Recordings will be performing at the  urlLink East End Cafe  on Saturday, July 12th, probably around 10pm.  If you're planning on attending, let me apologize in advance.   We've been playing shows less regularly than we should, and far more often than is justified (i.e., a sum greater than zero).  In the meantime, we have been recording a full-length mess in my basement.    In other news, I will be playing a supporting role in a friend's band,  urlLink Overlord , with shows beginning in August.  My friend, George, is also pictured below, surrounded by riot police.

       War   As a veteran of World War II, as a student of the history of our wars, and contemplating still another war, I suggest we keep certain things in mind.  First, that we must be extremely skeptical of whatever government officials tell us about the reasons for going to war. Second, that what is certain about war is that large numbers of innocent people will die, including many children, and what is uncertain about war is that any good will come of it.   --Howard Zinn ( urlLink 1 )

       Protest         When we protest we exist in several places along the continuum of time.  The prevailing opinion will always say we are living in the past:  When we protest today, we are living in the 1960's, as though we suffer segregation or the draft; when we protest in the 1960's, we are living in the 1930's, as though the Great Depression is at our backs; when we organize during the Great Depression, we are living during industrialization, as though we knew anything about children in factories.    Our champions exist in the future:  When we protest during industrialization, people of the 1930's have child labor laws; when we protest during the Great Depression, people in the 1960's have social security and a 40 hour work week; when we protest in the 1960's, people in 2003 have anti-discrimination laws and a lesson called the Vietnam War.    When we protest we are justified in the future and past; in the present we are attacked.  This is the way that history happens.

       Sex   Sex for me is mostly a process of evasion, at least at in the anticipatory stages--which is to say the vast bulk of the time.

        Humor vs. honesty   I try to keep my offensive views to myself.  I don't want to be perceived as "too serious."  To accomplish this, I will frequently employ the use of humor.  The disadvantage to being funny, however, is that people start to take you seriously.

       The Policy of Truth       The disadvantage to being honest is that it alienates.  People are emotionally symbiotic; they want you to like the same things they like.  My co-workers want me to like The Matrix.  They defend Keanu Reeves:  didn't I like Speed?  My friends want me to like the bands they like; they want me come out with them in the evenings, to fulfill the obligation we have as 20-somethings.  My supervisor wants me to like the 'war on terror'; he brought me a Wall Street Journal article detailing how colonialism squashed the Barbary Pirates.  Men want me to like sleeping with women; and sometimes women want me to like it, too.  Maybe I'm sensitive because I don't like Keanu Reeves, and the idea of squandering two hours of my limited time on this planet with him and his runway-model, fetish-clad comedy troupe is more than I can bear--particularly when there is a load of laundry I could be doing instead.  I'm not saying I'm above the Matrix; I'm not above anything, except a maybe respectable occupation.

       Fighting a war of compassion   Now that the United States has successfully colonized Iraq, the world can breathe a welcome sigh of relief.  Never again will Saddam Hussein threaten our national security by having control over the second largest oil reserves in the world.  Hussein will not hold these long-suffering wells hostage any longer; they have been liberated to pump oil for benevolent contractors like Dick Cheney's Halliburton and Donald Rumsfeld's Bechtel.  Truly, it is a watershed moment for humanity; and a beacon of hope for freedom-loving oil wells everywhere, who languish in captivity under tyrannical regimes the world over.  President Bush and his Coalition of the Willing (COW) forces represent the best of freedom and justice-loving nations.  If it weren't for countries like Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Eritrea--and their  urlLink well documented records  on human rights, religious tolerance and free elections--the United States would have to face despotic regimes like Iraq, Syria and France unsupported. Let us not forget those nations who stood by our side, like Macedonia; or those who conspired against us, like Germany.  To paraphrase William Safire, we will remember our friends--and our enemies.  President Bush has supported our troops every step of the way.  Giving countless speeches and umpteen 'thumbs-up,' our President has distinguished himself as a man willing to make the ultimate sacrifice; and if he does not make the ultimate sacrifice personally, he has the presence of mind to send tens of thousands of others to make that sacrifice for him.  Such esteem is not reserved solely for American servicemen and women, either; indeed, thousands of Iraqis from all walks of life have been championed in making sacrifices of themselves--oft times without prior knowledge they would be doing so.  Millions of Iraqis have gone dutifully without water, food, electricity or medical attention so that first  priority could be ensuring the safety of much abused oil wells.  No doubt President Bush intends to reward the Iraqi people in the weeks to come, making good on his promise of democracy.  It will be with great anticipation that we gather to witness the form of government the Iraqi people choose--as soon as the American military makes its decision.  Similarly, veterans returning home from the war will enjoy a special acknowledgement from President Bush in the form of his 2004 budget, which pays  urlLink particular attention  to their needs and the needs of their families.  In these ways President Bush makes clear he is a man who understands the meaning of sacrifice.  It is not since the fall of Manuel Noriega in Panama and the lasting victory of the drug war that the world has been spared so great a calamity by so narrow a margin.  George Bush has proven that America can fight a war of compassion and win.

What's wrong with that?"  "I told Debbie I'd be back tonight," Maureen said.  "I should call.  I hope she's not staying up."  Maureen set her hand on the receiver and then paused.  "What if she's asleep?"  "I don't see why you should have to go back tonight anyway.  I'm not such a bad guy."  "Not  bad ."    "What do you mean 'not  bad '?" I said, surprised.      "Well, I didn't know that before."  "You don't know that now, either."  "Then why are you trying to convince me?"  "Anyone can try to convince you they're not a bad guy!  That's what every jerk does."  "Well, at least you're not any type of threat.  I should call Debbie and tell her I'm staying.  I don't feel like trekking back to Brooklyn."    "Tell her if she wants to be so involved she should have showed up two hours ago with a change of clothes.  Why am I not a threat?"  "Orion!," Maureen squealed, pushing her face close to mine.  "I didn't mean it like that, honey."  "You think just because I had an episode in the hallway--"  "Hey, look buster, I've been waiting around all night for you to take advantage of me.  It's getting late and I'm tired."  "Well, how am I supposed to take advantage of you, anyway?  I have to be in a position of advantage.  We have to create some kind handicap for you."  "Do you want to tie one arm behind my back?"  "I mean a financial advantage."  "In that case I should be taking advantage of you."  "I wish you would hurry up.  I'm about to pass out over here."  "I'll call Debbie.  I hope she's not already asleep."

       Fourteen:  Sex   Well, we didn't have sex, that's for certain.  The reader may ask how this can be--how, after all that has been shared so far, and with such clarity of purpose, just how can it be that intercourse did not announce itself at our chamber door, beg pardon for the delay--it had come direct from an engagement in the South Bronx--and conspire to remedy the situation posthaste?  It is a hard thing to make sense of, I will grant you that.  Many have been the evenings since when I have pondered this mystery; to my best estimate, all the component parts were in place, to say nothing of the political justification provided by the war.  Of course, it is all too easy too blame oneself in these things--for my rather embarrassed station in life, say--and that is why I prefer to blame my date instead.  She seemed persistently in a state of not having sex with me for the entire evening, and in retrospect it strikes me as grossly inappropriate.    On the other hand, when it comes to sex I am not very persuasive, not even to myself, and doubtless this contributed rather centrally to the outcome.  Sex is excellent in theory.  Unfortunately, in practice it is even better.  This is a tremendous injustice when you haven't had any practice since the Carter administration--doubly so when the only thing you were practicing was Catholicism.  I want no truck with Catholicism; it is a discussion best left for another time.  And what can be said of sex in this particular circumstance is pitiful little; as such perhaps the reader will grant me reprieve for the duration.

       On Love   by Woody Allen     To be a really good lover, then, one must be strong yet tender. How strong? I suppose being able to lift fifty pounds should do it. Bear in mind also that to the lover the loved one is always the most beautiful thing imaginable, even though to a stranger she may be indistinguishable from an order of smelts. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Should the beholder have poor eyesight, he can ask the nearest person which girls look good. (Actually, the prettiest ones are almost always the most boring, and that is why some people feel there is no God.)

       Thirteen   At length I divested myself of the evening's hardships, prostrate on the bed of our hotel suite.  Much to the credit of my companion, I was not solicited to detail the varied misfortunes of my trek, but rather was left at peace, and attended to with a welcome impartiality.  From some place Maureen had procured a tray to be placed at the bedside; and on this tray had been assembled some pieces of fruit and chocolate, and a decanter of ice water.  Of the citrus fruits I did not readily partake on account of their tricky nature, but with the chocolates I was greatly pleased, and of these I ate a considerable quantity before Maureen thought to join me.    "Chocolate is good,"  I reflected, and Maureen nodded, smiling.    "Mmmm."  While much is made of the enamouring qualities which chocolate is believed to possess, and while Maureen did, indeed, strike me as particularly lovely in this circumstance; and while in the duration of my recovery I had not felt so acutely the strum of my heart-strings as I did at present; still it is very hard for me to explain the outcome of this exchange by the simple introduction of sugary treats to the equation.  I should rather like to think that the unseemliness and mounting misfortune of this whole affair had by some means induced itself into throes of an erotic crescendo!  Terrorists be damned--I was no longer to be deemed a  soft target!

       Twelve   The ice bucket was nowhere to be found.  I first ventured to trace the trajectory of its flight from the site of my collapse; but this ultimately proved fruitless--I could no longer distinguish the direction I was heading from the direction whence I had come.  A mounting frustration weighed itself upon my spirits, prompting me finally to flail and kick about the darkened corridor, jerking my already beleaguered anatomy hither and thither, in the vain hope I might smite the accursed thing with some piece of me, thereby revealing its location.  I felt myself being reduced to hysterics in short order, half-cursing and half-sobbing my way along the thoroughfare--now pleading with the article that it should return to my possession, now vowing its certain and wholesale destruction when it did.  If I did not find this wretched ice bucket, and procure some god-damnable ice, then surely the terrorists would win.    Finally I sat down.  My physical exertion had once again produced a feeling of lightheadedness and nausea, and I found it hard to breathe, what with the peculiar tightness in my chest.  I am not any kind of athletic person, after all; my present dilemma being enough to daunt even the most splendidly capable brute, I thought I did rather well for myself, all things considered.  At least I had not lost consciousness or been trod upon by any of the hotel wait-staff.  I was a special operative deep behind enemy lines, having suffered a string of indignities, but never to compromise my tactical imperative of stealth and concealment!  Why, my very objective remained concealed, even from me!  When Maureen appeared alongside me with the ice bucket in hand, I was still crouched in the darkness, contemplating my central role in the war and in the valiant cause of homeland security.  What next I remember was waking in bed with a damp towel across my head.

       Eleven: An Unfortunate Setback   No sooner had I advanced several yards than I was arrested by a curious, radiating pronouncement through the left hemisphere of my body.  Presently I cried out, and crumpled to the floor of the passage, ejecting the ice bucket from my grasp at a considerable velocity, and purposing in some way to cushion my fall--in this case with my shoulder and the better portion of an ear.  There I would remain, corpse-like and immobile, until sensation saw fit to revisit itself upon my limbs, and life upon my cadaver.  With some effort I erected myself, taking careful inventory of my every extremity, lest some item should prove lost or impaired.  Satisfied to this end, I sought to survey the corridor for any token of immediate approach.  I discerned none.  Could it be that the terms of my pursuit were wholly imagined?  Surely I might easily have been overtaken in the course of my tribulation.  Or perhaps the strangeness of my method struck bewilderment in the heart of my pursuer?  Whatever the case may be, I could sense no immediate threat; nothing, that is, beyond the irregular ticking of my heart-valve.

       Give It Up, Let It Go      This song is one of my favorites.  From a woman's perspective it may have much more "crunchy" guitar than we normally tolerate--I am not a woman, but my musical tastes are largely emasculated: I don't care for crunchy guitar myself--but what's great about this song is how melodic it is.  The harmonies are crazy, like something out of the Beach Boys.  Check out the harmonies on the very last chorus of the song.  Crazy-retarded.  I can't tell you what this song is about, but with a name like Give It Up, Let It Go, I like to think of it as an anthem for life; or, if nothing else, my music career.         urlLink Give It Up , by  urlLink George   What began with an Earnest yearning For pure utility Quickly became A hemispheric purging performed With Stalinesque finesse  All their papers burned And their tapes erased With their arms cut off All hands were lost Left helpless for anonymity To snuff their infamy  Not revenge for an Opaque offense Merely irrelevence Lesson to be learned: Muses, use your aesthetes with care For they're your archivists

       Ten:  Riddles in the Dark   The corridor was still.  No boss, no bludgeon.  On the other hand I couldn't see very far, not even to the end of the hallway, nor back to the elevator, peering as I might.  "Christ almighty," I observed.  I oriented myself in keeping with Maureen's instructions and began to tread lightly in this direction.  So far so good.   A little ice would do well, I thought.  I only hoped there would not be a crowd, nor any dancing.  I'd hate to make something like this into a major production.  How long is this hallway, anyway?  It seems not to run perfectly straight either, rather in some kind of trend-setting arc.  It's a pretty fascinating hotel, after all.  And how about that crazy shower?  I would get to the bottom of that before I left, that was sure.  Somebody's bottom had to be got to, anyway, if the date was to be deemed a success.  By the standards of on-line dating this was a watershed moment which now rested wholly in my capable, if violently tremulous hands.  All things being equal, it was unfortunate that I had since assumed the role of hunter-gatherer, which I have never enjoyed, except perhaps when I can find a 2/$3 bargain on bread at ACME.  Saturday nights are the best time to go, when the greasy throng are busy sluicing themselves up for date-rape and a fist-fight on Delaware Avenue, although by that time there is not much hope left for bread, or for produce; but at the very least my sanity is preserved, and I can oft times escape unmolested by man or child--   "What the hell was that?" I started.  Some distance behind me was suggested the soft thud as of a door closing.  There was nothing to be seen; the distance was too great.  I held perfectly still.  Even my breathing was suspended.  What was that?  Footsteps?  Or the intolerable din of blood in susurration about my head!  Oh, what torment held sway in that moment!  It could very well be footsteps; after all, there was no reason to imagine Maureen's boss did not have feet!  And now with everyone spying about for terrorists!              "Oh fuck," I declared.  I endeavored to hasten my emaciated frame down the corridor.  In confrontation I am pointedly bereft of any natural ability; but in flight I am more than able.  I also boast an impressive gait--all the more impressive after years of not owning a car, relying on my dogs as a regular means of propulsion.  It was clear to me that I could outrun a small, spiteful man.  But could I evade him?

       ACTIVISM UPDATE:  Savage Fired by MSNBC   July 7, 2003  Michael Savage's MSNBC show, The Savage Nation, was cancelled today because of homophobic remarks made by the host on the July 5 edition of the show, according to an Associated Press (AP) report.  Those comments--labeling a caller "a sodomite" and telling him to "get AIDS and die"-- were the subject of a  urlLink FAIR  action alert earlier today.  MSNBC spokesperson Jeremy Gaines told AP, "His comments were extremely inappropriate and the decision was an easy one."    Over the past five months,  urlLink FAIR  activists have written more than 2,000 individual letters to MSNBC expressing their concerns about Savage's record of bigotry and hate, and criticizing the network for hiring a host who routinely traffics in slurs while firing host Phil Donahue over his anti-war views.

       A Musical Interlude   It's a strange and wonderful thing when the songs that stick in your head are either your own or a friend's.  George Pasles' songs have been in my head for years now, regularly playing themselves out for me on my commute, at work, or at the surface of sleep.  I want to post several with lyrics (click on the name of the song to download), and here is the first:   Room Enough , by  urlLink Overlord    Well we've lived too long Much longer than we'd wanted  And we grew so dull  Far duller than thought possible  Yet our maudlin wails  Trail any hint of trauma  For though we've no hope  We're still addicts to its drama  Are the depths of your sympathies so endless? Is there anyone that you couldn't love?  The sad are wretched  And the happy are merely wrong  So you shift your pitch  To match who you'll string along  Demonstrate your love  With a straightedge and compass  Proving our lifelines  Are strictly asymptotic  Are the depths of your sympathies so endless? Is there anyone that you couldn't love? Is the breadth of our empathy limitless? Is there anyone that you couldn't love?

       Nine: Prelude to a Disaster    "That was Debbie again," Maureen reported.  "Ah."  "She says New York has gone to code cadmium orange-lite with just a smidge of alizarin crimson."  "What the hell does that mean?"  "It means a heightened possibility for a terrorist attack.  And she says they'll be going after soft targets, like hotels and restaurants."  "Oh god, look at this place--it's one big soft target.  Even this bed is soft."  "It's a little disconcerting."    "Well, what do we do?  Ask for a discount?"  "No, snoopy, the Hotel doesn't discount for terrorism.  That's just letting the terrorists win."  "Look, I'm from Philadelphia.  I don't believe in terrorism.  I believe in discounts."  "Well, that's how management here feels.  They can't let the terrorists win."    "Let them win?  What the hell does that mean, anyway?  Are they trying to break into the hotel business?"  "They're trying to blow up the hotel business."  "Right.  Well, I should probably get going.  I have to work Monday."  "I'm sorry, lambchop," Maureen said, taking my arm.  "Did I make you uncomfortable?"  "No, you're perfectly all right."  "But all the talk of terrorism... did I frighten you?"  "Look, I'm from Philadelphia.  I'm not afraid of dying in a fiery catastrophe.  I just don't want to be here when it happens."  "Honey, we've been dealing with this for two years.  The staff is taking every precaution to screen the items and people who come into the hotel."  "They're not doing us any favors letting people like me spend the night.  God, I'm thirsty.  Didn't we get any water to go with our alcohol?"  "There's some bottled water, but it's warm now."  "Do we have any ice?"  "We did.  There's an ice machine at the end of the hall, though.  Would you be a dear and get us some more?"  A fresh wave of anxiety seized me.  "What?  You mean out in the hallway?"  "Yes, boy-toy, right at the end of the hallway.  I would order more from room service but I'd rather not be their singular source of entertainment for the evening."  "Won't you come with me?  I don't know where you mean exactly."  "Silly, it's right at the end of the hall.  Just make a left and follow the lights.  Here, take our ice bucket," she said.  "I would get it myself but I don't want to run into you-know-who."  "Your boss?"  "That's right."  "Well, I don't want to run into your boss, either.  At least if you came with me it would be two against one.  Besides, can't he just look you up on the register?  He's probably lurking out there right now, ready to bludgeon the first person who steps out of the door."   "He's with the restaurant, not the hotel.  Whatever he's heard he won't be able to verify.  The hotel manager tonight is my buddy," Maureen winked.      Reluctantly I got up.  I was all out of sorts, frankly.  "You don't have a flashlight or anything?"  "Sorry, hon."    "Okay," I said dejectedly.  "But listen, keep the door locked and don't open it for anyone--not even me, unless I'm screaming 'Open the door!'  Then open it quickly."    "Go get 'em, tiger."

       Eight      After a brief interval and some anxiety over the positioning of my left arm, the phone in our suite began to ring.  Maureen shot up.    "That's for me," she said, and grabbed the extension.  I imagined it was some member of the restaurant staff--and sincerely hoped it would not be her boss.  I didn't know anything about Oompa-loompas, but I knew well enough that where small, angry men of authority are concerned, they do best to wax apoplectic in my absence.  I could clearly envision him barging into our room, Maureen and I caught in the act of some extreme immorality, like watching Showtime, or eating take-out pizza on chic plates.  His rage would radiate like an iron smelt at the nexus where professional duty met his private campaign to woo Maureen into precisely the same scenario--namely, bed--only by means of power instead of poverty.  The betrayal would be all the worse for it, stoking his wounded pride and discarded authority into a murderous hemorrhage.  It will be noted that I do not do well in these scenarios, where pizza dinner is suddenly recast into a high-plains African fracas for land and dominance.  I have never cared for competitive athletics on any level (including billiards) and I resent circumstances which create for me this expectation to perform in a predetermined role of action:  I am better suited to disappoint at my own discretion than to impress at someone else's.                "That was my roommate," she told me afterwards.  "If you want to strangle me and cart my remains out of the building you're out of luck.  She's home and will probably be calling every fifteen minutes now."      "What if I told her you went for a walk?"        "It's 10:30, sugarchicken."      "You decided to get a separate hotel room.  You're right down the hall from me, doing well."        "Not on my salary.  And she knows you don't have any money."  "Who ever heard of a poor mass-murderer?"    "This ass is not a mass, dear."   "Who ever heard of a poor single-person murderer?  "Hey, what's all the talk about murder, anyway?  What if you just wanted to take advantage of my body against my will?"  "That's how all my dates turn out.  Why can't you take advantage of  my  body against my will?"  "Then Debbie would have no reason to call."  "What's wrong with that?"  Maureen reeled back.  "I'm alone in a hotel room with a stranger and you're saying a single girl in New York can't have a friend check in on her!?  ....I would never take advantage of you against your will," she said obstinately.    "Well, what if I gave my consent?"  "Then I would have no reason to take advantage of you."  "What if you gave your consent?"  "Then Debbie would have no reason to call."  "What's wrong with that?"  "A Russian woman just disappeared not two weeks ago and you're saying it's safe to shack up with any strange, impoverished fool you meet over the internet!?"  "What if I  wasn't  saying it was safe to shack up with any strange, impoverished fool you meet on the internet?"  "Then you would have no reason to be dating me."    "What if I wasn't dating you?"  "Then you would have no reason to be poor."     "You have high-class tastes."  "I do."  "If I weren't poor I would never be able to afford dating you."  "If you weren't dating me you could never afford to be poor."    "Then Debbie would have no reason to call."  "Exactly."  That was when the phone rang for a second time.

       Seven:  The Burden of My Affections   Now, it has never been a trademark of mine that I should enjoy particular mastery in beseeching the wily female to suspend better judgment in favor of gradually becoming naked in my company.  (For years this woeful inadequacy, this nettlesome spectre, has haunted even the grandest of opportunities.)  To this end I am usually resigned to despair from the outset; I endeavor instead to invest myself in the few small things I can affect, such as breathing through my nose instead of my mouth, maintaining an appropriate posture, and taking care not to hold hands lest mine prove unduly temperate.  These are small things, hardly commensurate to the caliber of upper-class chicanery required for the American woman to remove her bra, but whose aggregate weight I like to regard as working somehow in my favor.  And to their credit, they have at times afforded me the calming knowledge that all bras must eventually be removed in one context or another--of this we can be certain--and as such so too will my beloved be removing hers, even if it is several hours after our date, while brushing her teeth.          For the moment, Maureen has since ended our spat of patriotism in favor of an HBO movie starring Jessica Lange.  I am watching it contentedly myself, remarking occasionally on the points I find noteworthy or humorous.  It is not a very good film, I am afraid; and yet it seems to entertain nonetheless.  The strangeness of our circumstances are being consumed by the familiarity of this American pastime, perhaps; and naturally there is little question as to the effects of alcohol and the steadfast approach of midnight on women and on men:  Maureen pulls me alongside her singlemindedly.

       Obedience       Obedience has special meaning in the spiritual context.  It refers specifically to one's relationship with God, and on the true realization of this relationship in one's daily life.  This is especially the case within the sacrament of marriage.  Obedience is an important part of living in communion with a spouse, particularly if you hope to have them house-trained before winter.  Obedience does not necessarily mean a strict adherence to the laws of man--for instance, going the speed limit on the Garden State Parkway, or abstaining from pornography on Sundays--and should never be misinterpreted as such.  Most everyone experiences periods of questioning in the course of their spiritual journey.  A person may ask themselves, "How can God exist, and especially under the current administration?"  This is a normal feature of a healthy spiritual life, and should not be taken as a sign of flagging obedience.  There are many great people known for their deep questioning of God, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Vladimir Lenin.  Lenin questioned God for the benefit of the Russian peasantry, and the peasantry questioned Lenin for the glory of God; finally the peasants questioned God directly for the whole convoluted affair, but it turns out God would not speak without his lawyer present.  In a similar way, Friedrich Nietzsche made a name for himself questioning the existence of God, and this worked very much in his favor until God questioned the existence of Nietzsche, ruining his vacation plans for that summer.  The moral of the story is that it is all well and good to question the existence of something, just so long no one has to forfeit their deposit in a French bordello.

       The Organ       urlLink The Organ  are a Vancouver quintet, formed in 2001.  In a short space of time, this all female ensemble has gained rapid exposure with the release of their first EP, Sinking Hearts; an accompanying two-song single, and a live show that has spirited them on tour with some of the most significant bands today.  A critical and popular favorite, The Organ write melodic and introspective music based on layered interplay between their instrumentalists--Debora Cohen, guitar; Ashley Webber, bass; Shelby Stocks, drums; Jenny Smyth, Hammond organ--and the intimate and doleful lyrics of their lead singer, Katie Sketch.  The Organ's " urlLink sound " has been commented on and debated over from the very beginning, so great is the fascination that it inspires.  "The Organ's melancholy melodies are intoxicating," writes Cyndi Elliot of Magnet Magazine.  The band is consistently compared with the best songwriters of the early 80's new-wave, writing structured songs around minimal arrangements, and creating a nuanced, textured sound that can be brooding and catchy at the same time.  The best of many bands can be found here--whether it is the weaving counterpoint melodies between organ and bass; the lean, bell-like intonation of sparkling guitars; the charmed tenacity of the snare; or the suspended lamentation of Sketch's cascading vocals--and much excitement is borne out of the desire to name The Organ's sound in precise terms.  "The Organ does it so well, it's hard to believe these kids are in their early 20's," writes John Parish of The Big Takeover.  "It makes me feel better than the electronic craziness of some of those 'I love the 80's' bands, and almost as sad as I used to feel in the 1980's, and I love 'em for it."  For their own part, the band accepts the associations with an amused detachment.  "Originally I was trying to do something a little more rock, like Elastica," says Sketch, "but obviously it didn't work out that way."  The Organ have played with an wide variety of contemporary bands such as Interpol, Hot Hot Heat, The Walkmen, The Von Bondies, The Soledad Brothers and Bratmobile; and most recently finished a tour across North America with Matador's New Pornographers.  The band has become well-known for the somber intensity of their live performances, which they happily acknowledge as involving very little physical movement on-stage.  "That's the only way we can be," says Sketch, "if I paid Debora a million dollars to jump up and down, she wouldn't.  That's just her personality."  "The Organ's approach is classic European detachment," writes Michael White of Calgary's News and Entertainment Weekly, "It creates an enveloping mood, and fully complements the music's soulful melancholy."  And perhaps it is a testament to the saliency of Sketch's dark lyrical themes--which range from interpersonal relationships to politics--that The Organ is so often perceived as a wholly melancholy affair.  Organist Jenny Smyth is herself caught between the band's music and its rueful subject matter: "The Organ's music sounds really happy and cheerful so I always get really shocked when people say 'your music is so sad and emotional' and I'm like  really !? I think it sounds like  la la la ..."  With so much attention already devoted to The Organ's sound and presentation, there remains nevertheless a lasting captivation with their distinction as an all female band.  "Other people tend to point it out," muses Smyth, "'Oh, an all girl band!' and I'm like, 'I'm a girl?'"  "I'm just playing with my friends," says Sketch.  "We wouldn't have cared if we'd found some really great boys to play with us, but instead we found some really great girls."  Still, the distinction is not without significance, as drummer Shelby Stocks knows first-hand:  her seventh-grade band teacher took her drumsticks away and gave them to a boy, informing her that girls don't play the drums.  "There was a part of me that wanted to prove him wrong--that girls can actually play.  What an idiot."

       Chastity      The appeal of chastity has waned considerably in the modern era.  This is because chaste persons don't have sex--not even on their lunch breaks.  The advantage to living chastely is that one is permitted to love indiscriminately all of humankind.  This is not ordinarily possible, unless you own a king-sized bed.  Chastity harnesses our baser impulses and channels them into mission and duty, even when we are off the clock.  There are not many people practicing chastity today.  The commercial secularism of the industrial societies has all but relegated the concept an anachronism from more religious times.  Most chaste people do not begin that way, but rather are driven to it by husbands who regularly quote dialogue from The Godfather.  This is not always ideal, particularly if you don't enjoy other forms of cardiovascular exercise, like masturbation.  Some people, hoping to find a happy medium, instead imagine themselves making love to Robert Deniro, or a young Marlon Brando, depending on the scene.  Few people enjoy sleeping with Luca Brasi, as this accounted for half of all new chastity converts in 2002.

       On Poverty   For innumerable centuries, Christian tradition has extolled the benefits of poverty, chastity and obedience.  Of these, poverty is by far the most popular today, and across all age groups.  Jesus taught that in the Kingdom of Heaven, the first will be last and the last will be first--an important thing to consider if one is to get a good seat; or, conversely, if you are going to beat the rush to the parking lot after the show.  Jesus also taught that the poor will inherit the Earth, and clearly this is true in many places already; however I am told that the waiting list for apartments in Manhattan is still rather long.    Jesus was not alone in placing singular emphasis on the poor.  St. Francis of Assisi harbored such love for his "Lady Poverty" that he wedded himself to her, but suffered a sudden change of heart when his in-laws began discussing Italy for retirement.   The final straw came when Francis predicted her father's appetite would guarantee a comfortable impoverishment for years to come.  Being good Catholics, they would not permit a divorce, but they did sleep in separate beds through much of this period.  In contemporary times, it is easy to understand the appeal of poverty for so much of the world today.  Poverty restricts and governs one's worldly distractions, thus allowing more fully the cultivation of the soul and spiritual pursuits.  One direct advantage of poverty is that it bolsters community in an increasingly alienated world.  It compels one to find the good in every unwanted corner of life.  The disadvantage to poverty is that your wardrobe will suffer and you will frequently be self-conscious when leaving the unwanted corners of life to attend a wedding.  Unfortunately, when you are poor, just as many people will be getting married as when you are rich.  This is a depressing thought, but so long as the wedding is not Catholic, the occasion may be expedited, leaving you with the better part of a Saturday afternoon by the time you get home.

       Never Shine On Me   Through the course of the night I laid with Maureen sleeping at my side.  At least she was asleep; I was forever unsettled in the dark.  I am not, after all, accustomed to sharing a bed with women, as doubtless you must readily accept, having ventured this far with me in our story.  It is quite a different thing than sharing a bed with a younger sister on a family trip, for instance, or with another man for the sake of economy.  No, to lay with a woman in this way is quite a different thing altogether.    As often happens in periods of sleeplessness, I was soon beset with a myriad of considerations.  There were many things to observe in the hotel room at that hour, for one thing.  We had retired with the windows open--the day had been unseasonably warm--and the sheer curtains of the room had at once taken up my cause, fluttering in tacit agreement.  From without came the sound automobiles and the air brake reports from city sanitation vehicles.  The Hudson river was however many blocks West of here; it could be seen from our window.  The thought occurred to me that in my senior year of high school I would sit on the rock-face of Hook Mountain and stare East, across the river, at my very location now.  But that was many years ago and I did not entertain the thought for very long.     Maureen's breathing was deep and steady.  In the dark everything took on the grainy texture of old film stock.  Her body was perfectly ghost-like beneath one white sheet.  It was indescribably lovely, as you might imagine.  My body was cool, too--and this was not lost on me:  how often is one granted the opportunity to observe such things about themselves?  Not often enough!  Life would be much better lived with an artificial light source accentuating only our best curves and angles.  I don't believe in the sun.

       It's Only Divine Right    urlLink     That nobody likes Philadelphia is one of the reasons I've always enjoyed coming back to it.  I'm forever coming back to it, on buses and on planes, late in the evenings; and in summertime it is always storming when I arrive.  Secretly, it's very exciting.  The streets are empty at night, warm and close, the oldest buildings are wet, and it is not unpleasant to walk alone, should you feel confident in the soundness of your route, or in the gamble one takes purposing to find a bus at some point along the way.  You will find people at this hour, of course, many of them city workers, or those involved in the production and distribution of baked goods; but in all you are left spying your way without passing a single soul for many blocks.    When you are as travelworn as I was last night, however, you do not walk, least of all when you have arrived at the international airport after many delays and too few meals.  Should you arrive at PHL after midnight, there will be no train to take you to Center City; not only will there be no train, there will be no attendant at the terminal information desks, there will be no attendant at the transportation information desks; there is only the unflagging insistence of airport signs and markers that you continue to baggage claim and ground transportation.  At the Philadelphia International Airport, "ground transportation" is an extensive queue of taxis, limousine and van shuttle services, with a $20 base rate to escort your soon-to-be-shystered buttocks into Center City.  It shames me to think that I joined this line of hapless sheep before resolving to find the SEPTA bus terminal for the airport--which is about as easy as finding a deadly weapon in Iraq, I might add.  After some anxiety relating to changing large bills for the bus fare and being uncertain as to the frequency of the runs, I was able to catch the route 108 to 69th street and transfer all the way back into the city via the subway shuttles--net gain to me $22.40 including tip.  Today I was able to buy milk.         Part of the excitement when flying into Philadelphia relates to my traveling companions.  When you fly to Denver, it's a perfect fit: everyone is white, they wear canvas hats and sandals, the older women have long straight grey hair and deep wrinkles, they are fit and attractive.  I understand the people traveling to Denver just by observing them.  I know what the tans are for, and the sunglasses, and the white T-shirts, and the strappy backpacks and mesh accessories and the bottled water and the books and the hats--oh, the hats!  Young moms and their ponytails; I'm forever falling in love with young moms and their ponytails.    But you'll never make heads or tails of people traveling to Philadelphia.  They're either black or they're like me, unremarkable.  There's no overarching selling point to define the culture of the city, so there's no particular commonality, no giant stereotype beating you on the cranium.  I understand the blacks based on their families and their histories; but what the fuck are the white people thinking?  There's no natural beauty here--no bristling seaport, no adjacent mountain ranges or nearby wine-tasting valleys; the humidity is high and the air is not clean, and neither are the streets.  They must, like, live here or something.  The warm hand of commercialism has not descended on Philadelphia so singularly as Denver, San Francisco or Seattle; as a result, none of us know what the hell we are supposed to be about.  Put simply, we don't know how to dress.    Denver has been figured out commercially, if ever the point of commercialism was to determine what people like and sell it back to them at exorbitant rates.  The supermarket--nay, almost every major franchise in the city--has polished wood grain floors, an espresso bar, and some sort of "library" and lounge area.  (The supermarket also doubles as an art gallery and a night club where live bands perform.)  Everything is purposely, self-consciously, unspontaneously designed to sell not just bread, but community.  My growing suspicion is that it's very easy to live in a place of great physical beauty, but hard to suffer the people--unless the place also happens to be poor; unfortunately we can't all live in Cuba.  I say this because I live in a sweltering hole and would never be able to afford to live somewhere nice.  Inasmuch as this is my station, please allow me to elaborate:  A beautiful place is where everyone wants to live--and that's why it takes an hour to drive into San Francisco at practically any time of the day.  The  more people want a beautiful home secluded in the wilderness, the more their neighbors will surround them, pushing further back to get further away; meanwhile their supermarkets sell back the community that they don't want to pay for in taxes.  Oh the humanity!    As for Philadelphia, well.  There is something refreshing about poverty when the alternative is being badgered by dreadlocked trust-fundafarians in the all white Boulder, CO--easily the acoustic guitar capital of the world--for money and cigarettes.  One thing I will say about Philadelphia though: it's a nice place to live, but I would never want to vacation here.  That's just depressing.

       Mad Girl's Love Song   by Sylvia Plath  I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my lids and all is born again. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  The stars go waltzing out in blue and red, And arbitrary blackness gallops in: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.  I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade: Exit seraphim and Satan's men: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.  I fancied you'd return the way you said, But I grow old and I forgot your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  I should have loved a thunderbird instead; At least when spring comes they roar back again. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. (I think I made you up inside my head.)

       On Solitude   It is not easy to obtain solitude in an urban environment.  One might think poverty would be isolating enough to guarantee an evening without visitors, but just tonight as I retired to my private chamber an individual from the order Coleoptera announced himself from behind my bureau.  I've been preoccupied with him ever since.  And to think I had my evening so carefully planned!  What he was doing around these parts is anybody's guess, although eating seemed to be a substantial part of it, as I originally had him mistaken for some kind of cricket.  Then I was reminded of similar visit some weeks ago, only from a much smaller sojourner, maybe half his size.  "I thought for certain you had gone for good!" I exclaimed, marveling at the resemblance.  My companion whirled his antennae.  "But how have you managed this long," I inquired, "for clearly there is no sustenance to be found in this house--indeed, so rarely even for myself--and nary are the crumbs that should fall within your many legged reach!"  This is what I tell all my houseguests, because while I don't mind a bit of the old ecosystem around the home, I prefer a fine-tuned one.  Somebody died on the first floor this week and I didn't even know they had been staying here, nobody bothered to tell me about it.  I still don't know who it was because they managed to conceal their presence in death with the same craft--and probably the same furniture--as they had in life.  Of course, death in the late summer is scarcely concealed at all, as I'm sure you can well appreciate.  But producing a body has proved a vexing occupation at best.  I've only uncovered a gnawed Kool-Aid packet and some colorful fecal deposits where I thought for certain I would discern a shallow grave.  I'm sure the old sport was only extending the courtesy of expiring in some out of the way place, but really death can be such an inconvenience when it begs the temporary repositioning of a refrigerator.    How, then, can one maintain a life of complete solitude?  Murder comes immediately to mind, as it is much easier to work someone's death into your schedule when you are able to consult your calendar first.  Of course, this brings with it certain moral considerations which are best suppressed--unless you enjoy moving heavy appliances on the weekend.  A vow of solitude does not give us license to begin killing everyone willy-nilly, however.  This is particularly true as we climb the evolutionary ladder, for instance, beginning with the arthropods and extending laterally to certain members of the Nematodes, commonly known as "the Bush cabinet."  Also, anyone cute, who wears their hair in any sort of bob, should be invited in for dinner--and in this case I am not speaking of mice.  Solitude is a permeable condition, not bound by trifles over right and wrong, and in this way mirrors the religious morality of our president, who more than anyone exemplifies what it means to be alone in the world.

       Love Vs. Infatuation   What then is the difference between love and infatuation, and will one's bank statement reflect it?  Is it better to admire someone from afar--say, across the street with binoculars--or would it be better to invite them over for showering?  This depends on whether you have to work the next morning.  For it is said that to admire someone, one need only know them in passing, whereas in love, one must share something longstanding, like bronchitis.  But how can one ever know for sure?  If you feel yourself light-headed with excitement and unable to be productive, it is infatuation; if your doctor prescribes antibiotics, it is love.     The Economy of Love   The economics of love are less exact.  We all pay a price for love, although I understand the rates are lower at Broad and Spring Garden streets.  But don't think you can buy love like any other commodity--unless of course it is Valentine's Day.  Let's face it:  love requires some level of discretionary income.  If you are poor, date someone with money who will see you for who really are--earthy and uncomplicated; and avoid dating your peers, who will also see you for who you really are--a bum.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but if the beholder earns under 30k you will probably hear about it.

       The Advantage to Dying   Two days ago Maureen's father died of terminal cancer.  (Our second date took place in Philadelphia after she had relocated here to be with him during this period.)  I called the house yesterday but she had just stepped out.  I spoke with her youngest sister on the phone.  She's engaged to be married in November; there was a hope on the part of the whole family that her father would be able to see it.  Maureen's told me a lot about her--about her job which routinely flies her to Paris and her fiancé who's sold B-movie screenplays to Hollywood.  She's closer in age to myself than Maureen.  She's also very sweet natured and less prone to butt heads with Maureen than some of the other sisters in the family (it is a big family dominated by women).    I was caught off guard when she introduced herself over the phone, and when I realized there was no Maureen available to speak with.  Awkwardly I blurted out my condolences.  I wish I had spoken in a more familiar tone.    While Maureen's father was dying he spoke with the dead.  He didn't speak with the living--for instance, someone who simply wasn't there.  He specifically had conversations with people who had already died, or other people who could not be identified.  Some of his episodes were rife with metaphors involving trains and gates and times and unseen people, a little boy in particular, who would be helping or showing or opening or somehow involving themselves in a process which her father was preparing himself for.    Maureen's father was an phenomenal reader, a history buff who spent any free time in his study, surfacing occasionally for meals.  He lost all interest in these things--books, newspapers, headlines--while he was dying.  In a similar way his body stopped consuming calories--his weight dropped to 123lbs.  Gradually he let go of the things which had comprised his life to that point.  On Sunday Maureen sent out an email; hospice said that her dad probably had two weeks to live.  He died the following afternoon.  Maureen is lucky because she was able to be with her dad while he was dying.  They talked extensively; he talked a lot about his feelings about his life, perhaps because he was a good communicator to begin with, but also because hospice-care facilitates these types of activities.  Someone once told me that, if we're lucky, we are born, we grow old, we get sick, and we die.  That's if we are lucky, because that is what we are designed to do: part of our purpose in life is to die.    There is not a lot of time to our lives, and death reminds us.  This makes choosing our life immediately important.  It also lends perspective to life, when we consider our preoccupation with things like conflict and war and money and reputation.  Large institutions--governments, corporations--don't experience mortality in the same way, so their cultures don't acknowledge it.  It is easy for governments to justify war, for example, justified or not.  That's because governments never die of cancer.  They lose the advantage of having that perspective; they never gain that wisdom.  So they persist, being consistently foolish, serving the needs of power, as all institutions naturally do.  Even a fool can come close enough to death to have it touch them, and force a change in perspective.  That's the advantage to dying.

       The End of an Affair   We were riding the subway to Maureen's apartment in Brooklyn.  Maureen was wearing a crazy nylon jumpsuit and a red hat, and her shoes were strangely angular, reminding me of a carpentry tool.  I'm not stylish but I didn't feel too intimidated being with her.  A lot of people couldn't tell we were together.  I was standing up most of the time, trying to keep a particular expression.  Maureen would begin speaking to me and excite the attention of everyone around us.  Or I would start to say something and then distract myself thinking about all the leering men and what they thought about it.  I can distract myself quite easily this way.  I didn't want them to think I'd just had sex all over town with this girl and that they didn't have a chance.  Everyone should have a *chance*, at least--even a jerk.  But the worst jerks are the kind that have to smother all over their girlfriends to make everyone else feel like they don't even have a chance.  I get very tired thinking about it.    We did quite a bit of walking that day, even though we weren't feeling too hot.  I got to see Maureen's apartment and her view of the city.  We bought some vegetables and ate lunch and Maureen changed into these bright pink Chinese slippers that looked like they had the arch-support of a wheat thin.  All the kids in the neighborhood couldn't shut up about them.  But they were nice about it, and it made Maureen laugh.  We finally sat down in this park that didn't have any grass but had a lot of dogs and joggers.  There was also a utility truck that kept passing by, throwing dirt on us at every opportunity.  Still, it was nice to sit and talk with Maureen in the waning hours of our date.  When we departed Brooklyn we rode over the Williamsburg bridge and Maureen told me about her rides to work, crossing that bridge at dawn.  We both returned home that evening, and were sick for the rest of the week.  Maureen had bronchitis and I had sinusitis.  At first we thought it was SARS.

      We were both sick when we woke the next day; Maureen had chest pains and my throat felt funny.  "I wonder if we're allergic to each other, Salvador."    I went to take a shower.  You might think it's very romantic to take a shower with your date, but my plan was to expectorate all over the floor.  Actually, I'm not crazy about showering with people even when they are my date.  There's a lot of standing around for one thing.  I'm not saying it's the worst thing that could happen; I guess it depends on your mood.  But I don't think I feel too strongly about it.  They say when you reach a certain age you get set in your ways, and this is probably a good example of that.  Maybe if I showered with people everyday I would feel differently.  But that hardly ever happens unless I go to a pool--and how often does anyone go to a pool?    I was showering for a while.  I showered the hell out of that hotel, trying to get the water to run into the middle of the room.  It was constantly running down the drain.  I showered all over the place but whenever the water went outside the curtain it would just sit in the middle of the floor, not trying anything funny.  It was the goddamndest thing.  I investigated until I could see where the floor was just slightly angled at the border of the stall.  It was a clever design, I can tell you that.

       Why Can't A Woman Be More Like A Man?   by Donald Rumsfeld     Why can't a woman be more like a man?  Men are so honest, so thoroughly square;  Eternally noble, historic'ly fair;  Who, when you win, will always give your back a pat.  Well, why can't a woman be like that?  Why does ev'ryone do what the others do?  Can't a woman learn to use her head?  Why do they do ev'rything their mothers do?  Why don't they grow up--well, like their father instead?  Why can't a woman take after a man?  Men are so pleasant, so easy to please;  Whenever you are with them, you're always at ease.  Why can't a woman be more like a man?  Men are so decent, such regular chaps.  Ready to help you through any mishaps.  Ready to buck you up whenever you are glum.  Why can't a woman be a chum?   Why can't a woman behave like a man?  If I was a woman who'd been to a ball,  Been hailed as a princess by one and by all;  Would I start weeping like a bathtub overflowing?  And carry on as if my home were in a tree?  Would I run off and never tell me where I'm going?  Why can't a woman be like me?

       On Maintaining a Good Humor in Combat     urlLink     There comes a time for every citizen when our nation calls on us to go to war.  Most of us eagerly await this call, unless of course we have just sat down to dinner.  If your nation shows up at your door, tell them it is not a good time, as you are in the middle of a bath.  If your nation persists, say that you have a hard time remembering basic details--like how to launder your shorts in the rain--particularly when exploding in a fiery ambush.  If your nation says it is your civic duty, do your best imitation of a South Philadelphian and accuse them of being soft on "the enemy," then chase  them out of your neighborhood with an American flag cudgel.  If you  do  go into the military, for God's sake please pick a job that keeps you from getting shot at.  This is never any kind of fun--and it's a very good way to spoil an evening.  If your hope is to be killed instantaneously, certainly there are better ways to lower your monthly electric bill.  Not that killing other people is any fun either.  Remember Ezra Pound's lasting impression:  "The real trouble with war is that it gives no one a chance to kill the right people."  More often than not, the "right" people are watching you expire in droves on CNN from a yacht serving cocktails in Lake Michigan, with a hand-written sign that reads, "We Support Our Troops."  But this is no reason to despair.  The right people will always die of their own accord, and sometimes in embarrassing positions.  It is particularly important for combat troops to "be of good cheer," and certainly not to "ask for the resignation of the Defense Secretary."  This only serves to hurt the Defense Secretary's feelings--and doesn't he already have enough thrust upon him without the weight of hurt feelings?  Bear in mind also that questioning the policies of one's government only helps the enemy, who also questions our government, but in a multiple-choice format.  This allows the enemy to grade the results much faster, whereas most Americans receive their responses in essay form.  This leaves Americans getting most of their information from the National Football League, which speaks volumes about our society, if only they weren't measured by the pint.

       House of Ellsworth    continued   At length I have endeavored to detail the circumstances attending this night in my own mind; my recollection, if the reader should find it peculiar, no doubt reflects the strangeness of the occasion, as my memory in this regard would remain the evening's sole inheritor.  It is only now, several days elapsed, that I purpose to take up my pen and relate the harrowing ordeal as it occurred:  The evening was dark, and the gloam pressed heavy against the house.  True!--famished--very, very dreadfully famished I had been; but witness how craftily I hastened my way to the kitchen; why will you  say  that I cannot find my way?  The famine has only sharpened my senses--not destroyed--not dulled them.  Above all was the sense of taste acute.  I tasted all things in heaven and earth.  I tasted many things in hell, and several in Congress.  How, then, am I delirious?  Hearken! and observe how healthily--how calmly I resolved to make a sandwich.  I steadied myself before the refrigerator door.  Inside was cold, frightfully cold, like the tomb of Ann Coulter--how curious that life and warmth should be drawn from within!  As the bell sounded the hour, I was perched over my plate like a jay, anticipating a fine repast.  Not once did I rise to pace, rant or rave!  I presided over the feast as a king might over a banquet--with grace and poise--do you mark me well?  But no sooner than I had finished my plate than my attention was arrested by a banana.  Ah-ha!--the banana, with its sugary, seedless pulp!  But you should have seen me.  How I strode to the fruit and handled its porous exterior.  And then, with a glass of Vitamin D milk, how stealthily I retired to my chamber--quietly! oh, so very quietly--so not to disturb the sparkling, seamless garment of night that whispered throughout the house.  Oh-ho!  And now how perfectly I was concealed within the city; if by some chance a visitor would call upon the house--some familiar plague of acquaintance--no answer would be issued forth from the darkness!  I was perfectly small now--perfectly unobserved!  Perhaps they would discern I was home; perhaps they would  suspect  it!  For it is commonly understood that I am loathe to venture far from my books.  It is hardly any secret.  And yet they persist, like a terrible clockwork, never quitting me, scaring me half out of my wits at every hour, unceasingly as they materialize, unannounced, at my door.

       Night in the House of Ellsworth    Philadelphia   At 8 o'clock, p.m. Roommate, Nicholas and a gentleman caller took their departure, leaving me in possession of the Ellsworth Shanty.  The first observation I made thereupon was, "Verily does my estomago protest for a meal."  The impulse so acute, it put me almost beside my propriety; and I counted myself most fortunate not to be entertaining, lest I should collapse forthwith in a famine-induced slumber.  Many were the evenings of my youth that fatigue did visit itself upon the house, calling expressly for lack of sustenance, with neither ale nor wafer to tide me till the morn; and so I greeted my condition with the weary resignation of someone for whom the familiarity of their symptoms is as marked as much by complacency as by vexation.  In the south of Philadelphia there exists an impressive tradition of eating, and it would be folly to think I have not pursued this  nonpareil  to my every advantage.  There is of course the Washington Avenue pretzel dispensary, whose destination in transit I am often times spied for by the men and women of 9th street row, a few minutes after midnight, and whenever a dollar proves handy.  The proprietor is a round man with large bundles of currency wrapped in elastic bandings which he snaps curtly should you produce any large bill.  There are many nomadic packs of youth at this hour, and my crab-like compatriot recedes into the belts and furnace of his machinery until summoned for another exchange.  (In a similar way, I make a hasty retreat to Ellsworth; I am not by nature a person of easy talk.)  There is also the Italian Market, which must only be attempted in the early hours, lest one be swallowed by the throng mid-day.  I learned early on to prepare myself the meals I hoped to profit by in days ahead, and the market has been instrumental to this end.  For instance, I have spent considerable time in the development of a type of pan-cooked battercake, which I employ to offset the shooting pains I awaken to most mornings.  I have also a rice and bean compound which goes very well with bread, and a potato and cabbage mixture that was a favorite among the Irish in times of prosperity.  Of these articles I have subsisted heartily for many years.

       On the Question of Mortality   Dying is an important part of a healthy, active lifestyle. After all, nobody wants to live forever--unless they already enjoy rent-control. And even if death is a total state of nothingness, it's still better than $700 a month for an efficiency in Bella Vista. Dying should be a welcome part of the human experience, especially when it comes to gentrification. If your life's ambition is to die before thirty, you can save big bucks, even if you forfeit the security deposit on your apartment--and it's never too early to start thinking about retirement.  Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live, but short men that live with women encounter many bosoms.  Some things are hard to give up, and women don't make that any easier, unless they watch Dr. Phil on a daily basis.

       Job Corner    by  urlLink Stephen Lentz    Sorry to have not responded to your many politically motivated forwards recently, but I must confess that I have spent the last month readjusting to the work world.  Yeah, it sucks.  I much preferred the summer, when the City of New York paid me to sit on my ass for an entire month.  But, as Shakespeare once said, "ain't paybacks a muthafucka?!"  Yeah, the children are definitely getting the last laugh these days.  But seriously, school has been OK, and it's nice to be in place where I know everyone's name now, and am able to kiss the appropriate asses that need to be kissed, rather than simply groping around in the dark trying to figure out the identity of my actual boss.  That's the thing about schools... who the hell am I supposed to report to anyway?!  Principal, Assistant Principal, Staff Developers, the Special Ed. Director, the head custodian?  It used to be so confusing, but this year it's like, "Ah yes, I know your opinion means this side of dick... I'll just keep nodding in agreement until you finish up though."

       Reproductive Rights   Everyone should have the right to reproduce, although not everyone reproduces right, which only underscores the importance of finding a partner first.  This is not easy:  even with the advantages of technology, dating services, and women walking their dogs on Sundays, still we find ourselves turning to chocolate for decent company.  But what about our biological imperative to populate, or, more popularly, copulate?  This will vary by individual--and God help you if you are Catholic.  Every religion finds a place for nature's oldest ice-breaker, although if you think this includes the church confessional you should probably see a psychologist.

       Nickel and Dimed      When someone works for less pay than she can live on--when, for example, she goes hungry so that you can eat more cheaply and conveniently--then she has made a great sacrifice for you, she has made you a gift of some part of her abilities, her health, and her life.  The "working poor," as they are approvingly termed, are in fact the major philanthropists of our society.  They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that others will be shiny and perfect; they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stock prices high.  To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone else.  Barbara Ehrenreich

       Thanksgiving     I'm not convinced that our economic system meets the needs, material or spiritual, of its citizens.  For example, I have the material need to get a good night's sleep.  But this is not possible when your father curses in the middle of the night because he hates his job.  So I indict our economic system for giving my father nightmares about financial security in his golden years.   The solution now is to medicate people who are reacting normally to a profoundly false social system.  People will naturally react to insecurity, fear and acute stress with the biological response of depression.  It's not because our brain isn't properly regulating serotonin; it's because our lives actually  do  suck to a phenomenal degree.

       More on Death and Dying   We did not make this world, but we make part of this world.  In dying we let go of both the things that we make and the things that have been made.  Because death is a normal, healthy way to end one's life, it is helpful to consider the things we will miss, but equally important to consider the many things we won't miss.    Most of us have some idea of the things we will miss.  Chocolate, for instance, is high on everybody's list.  Also, ice cream.  Consider now, some things we won't miss, like men who adjust themselves in public.  I hold out great optimism towards death for this reason alone.  Also, network news-broadcasters.

       Diabolique   Saturday night I was not permitted to attend a fetish ball because I wore objectionable pants.  I was instructed to take them off, if I wanted to attend the event.  As I rode the subway home, I considered the advantages one enjoys in rejection.  Fondly I recalled the time I was rejected at a dance club because I wasn't wearing a wife-beater or adjusting my genitals in conversation with friends.  I thanked the bouncer--now I had money for milk and bread.  Social rejection is a big money-saver.      When you are rejected from Philadelphia's premiere fetish event last Saturday night, you do well to have cab fare home.  Instead, I wandered Northern Liberties wrapped in pantyhose and duct-tape with welder's goggles dangling from my neck.  Poor people are not really interested in this, but that does not make riding the subway any less upsetting.  I was fortunate to have my work jacket at my disposal, even though Saturday was very warm night.

       A Brief Reflection on Saturday Night   Music isn't any kind of life.  I can't hear out of the left side of my head.  I spent yesterday in my bedroom, with the bedsheets secured against the windows and my corpse immobile for the duration.  It was a good show, overall.  I wasn't nauseous until this morning; it always takes a few days for my nervous system to bounce back.  I'm not any kind of performer, is what I mean.  Just ask my ex-girlfriends.    Music and women don't mix.  Anyone who goes into music to just to get girls is a lot smarter than me--but that doesn't mean you'd be very impressed by them.  They're the type of jerks who, when you drink a beer with them, they're constantly in a good mood, on account that they got a girlfriend by posturing as some kind of musical jackass.  I can spot a musical bastard like that a hundred miles away, because they usually have a hot girlfriend.  That's the goddam pisser about it all.  One time I knew this jerk in a surf band who was a real talented bastard when it came to being musical.  I mean, I'm maybe half the jackass this particular individual was when it came down to sheer talent.  Anyway, he had this girlfriend that was always popping up at his goddam shows--I only know because I had a close friend who enjoyed this sort of thing, and so I'd try to make an appearance and all--and you couldn't help but notice that this girl was pretty.  Even my friend would tell me all about it.  Well, one time we all sat together and I asked this girl what she was studying in school.  I feel like I'm constantly asking girls what they're studying in school, but you can hardly blame me.  You have to take an interest, particularly in other people's girlfriends.  So this girl started telling me about how she studied philosophy and how Kierkegaard thought you shouldn't believe in religion, but that you should  act  like you do.  I couldn't imagine how she'd gone so long dating this chooch.  I don't want you to think I'm drawing any kind of lousy conclusions about this.  I'm just saying that music is a crumby way to meet girls, especially when they become attracted to you so easily.

       Historians Dispute Analogies to Germany, Japan, with Iraq   The Bush administration has continually compared the situation of post war Iraq with that of Germany and Japan under occupation after WW II. At one point, administration spokesmen even alleged that US troops in Germany had faced attacks by " urlLink Werewolves ," or, former SS men. This allegation is unfounded. No US troops were killed by Werewolves in post-War Germany, and they assassinated maybe one mayor, though I understand that is controversial.  Likewise, the administration of Japan was by old New Dealers who strengthed trade unions and democratized. The major projects of the Bush administration in Iraq have been to dissolve existing unions, to completely throw open the country to unregulated investment (which could easily turn speculative and predatory), and to install a regressive flat tax that will favor the emergence of super-rich robber barons.  -- urlLink Juan Cole

       Conclusion    How did our narrator solve this puzzle?   The narrator cannot ordinarily afford to drink Vitamin D milk out of a glass, but on this particular evening he made an exception.  The total calorie content of this food exceeded the narrator's normal suppertime allowance, causing his stomach to expand and subsequently creating a sensation of 'fullness'.  It was this physiological manifestation which the narrator mistakenly took for an interloper.

       House   cont.   But tonight the taverns would not have me to swindle!  I sat down at my desk and lighted the overhead lamp.  From my shelf I selected only the most appropriate title for an eve as fine as this.  And do not doubt for one moment that this eve was not a fine one--indeed, one of the finest in recent memory!  Every thing about it was ideal; every last detail conspired to make it great.  The light from my lamp had never burned so benevolently.  And the words illuminated!  For your life, you have never seen a text so positively readable.  My hands, in sifting the pages, never once fidgeted or took to distraction.  My general posture, in fact, had never before been so sensible.  My hair laid agreeably and my toenails did not quarrel.  My nose contented itself above my mouth as never a nose has been observed to do.  My eyes!  I daresay my eyes were so excellent that just one of the usual pair of ocular organs would have suited me on this night.  The desk could not have been a better height; the chair rose to greet my fundament with the most conciliatory of expressions.  There can rarely a comparison be made to the miraculous fever of industry which took hold of me that night.  All around me the house was still--perfectly still!--as though its very breath had been suspended for my labors!  But, no... that was not entirely true; there was an odd presence here now--I could sense  it !  There was something else here; something not made of wood, brick, or mortar.  Surely I know a stranger in my own home!  But I will tell you what was stranger still:  something was moving in the very chamber where I now sat!  I cast the lamp about in every dark corner.  Nothing.  I addressed my intruder in a respectable tone:  "Hello, there, my friend.  Do not be alarmed.  Come out into the light where I can see you better!  There's no reason duck about in the shadows--ha ha!"    Just then the foreign presence moved, pressing hard up against my abdomen.  I fell upon the bed with surprise.  It was then that I realized the folly of my pursuit.

       The First of the Gang To Die   It was nearly midnight when we arrived in Pittsburgh.  The Quiet Storm cafe was packed with our fans, making it all the easier to cart our equipment through the deserted club.  I deposited my corpse on a sofa at immediate stage-left, and commenced a form of nausea-suppression therapy I like to call not listening to my drummer's opinions on Israel.*  Our friends, The Bullet Parade, played a stomach-turning rendition of "Shoplifters of the World, Unite and Take Over"--which is to say really first-rate.  Carrie attended to my Gore-Tex hood with massage therapy, while Joanne procured peppermint tea to settle my stomach.  I felt like a regular Mao Tse-tung; I worried constantly about the shameful spectacle unfolding before our Pittsburgh audience.  *Just kidding, Dan.

       A Warm Missive  to Fox News   I was saddened to hear Fox News analyst Liz Trotta associate Moveon.Org with the "World Socialist Movement."  I don't know how she arrived at this conclusion, but it's generally regarded as inaccurate, to put it nicely.   Many people enjoy The O'Reilly Factor, and enjoy the guests he features.  Let's not discredit Fox's professionalism by making bold, inaccurate claims; or at least without correcting these errors once they are discovered to be wrong.  I would like Ms. Trotta to correct herself, for the sake of journalistic integrity and accuracy, which I am certain she holds in high regard.  Thank you for your consideration,  James Ryan Boyd    ========  Through Fox Watch, many of you have helped monitor every single program that has aired on the cable station Fox News Channel for the past month. Those of you participating have filed hundreds and hundreds of reports about distortion, inaccuracies, and bias -- breaches of the basic standards of journalism.   Wednesday night, a Fox Watch monitor caught an outright lie during one of Fox News' flagship programs, The O'Reilly Factor. In a discussion of progressive websites, host Bill O'Reilly called TomPaine.com "the most rank propaganda in the world."   Fox News analyst Liz Trotta responded:   "Well, how many people do you think -- who look at MoveOn.org, know it's affiliated with the World Socialist Movement..."   This outrageous and false charge could only have been intended to discredit the work of MoveOn.org and its members. It is akin to the tactics of the McCarthy era.   Call on Fox News to dismiss Liz Trotta for such an utter lack of journalistic scruples:   Fox News Channel (212) 301-3000 comments@foxnews.com   Sincerely, --Noah T.

       My Mid-East Crisis   In retrospect, I could have done without the crossfire discussion of the West Bank.  I am riding with George and our drummer, Dan, in the last remaining vehicle of the Overlord fleet; Jon, Carrie, and gear have been gathered up by a Pittsburgh-based salvage team also known as Jon's sister in a minivan.  We will attempt to make this show.  My spirits are high:  hot tea and Tylenol have done the trick.  I repose in the passenger seat.  Somehow, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict comes up.  Dan has taken Islam to task in the back seat, and George is not agreeing.  I am not either, but I enjoy hearing the perspective, because I think it reflects a popular attitude towards Muslim culture which warrants close attention.  George speaks wonderfully to the disparity of power between the two sides, and against the idea that Islam as a religion is uniquely intolerant of other perspectives.  The argument escalates, however, and 45 minutes later I no longer have an opinion; but my stomach is ready to make a concluding remark all over the streets of Pittsburgh.

       The Capture of George W. Bush   The Democratic candidates just have to take off these kid gloves. I'd begin by asking some hard questions about Republican administrations' past relationship with Saddam. Put that photo of Rumsfeld shaking Saddam's hand in 1983 in the commercials; ask hard questions about former Reaganites now serving in the Bush administration who supported Saddam to the hilt while he was gassing Iranian troops and Kurds; find out who authorized the US sale of chemical and biological precursors to Saddam; and be so rude as to bring up the horrible betrayal committed by Bush senior when he stood aside and let Saddam massacre all those Shiites in 1991, after they rose up in response to a  Bush  call for the popular overthrow of Saddam. The US military could have shot down those helicopter gunships that massacred Shiites in Najaf and Basra. Bush senior clearly told them to let Saddam enjoy his killing fields. And imagine, the Bush administration officials are actually getting photo ops at the mass graves their predecessors allowed to be filled with bodies!  What happened Sunday was that the Republicans captured a former ally, with whom they had later fallen out.  -- urlLink Juan Cole

       The Quiet Storm Cafe, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania    urlLink Overlord  suffered some casualties last night.  I became sick yesterday morning and proceeded to be sicker in the course of the seven or so hours it takes to travel from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.  Not to be outdone, our bassist,  urlLink Jon Robb , jettisoned the passenger-side wheel of his car into the icy night along I-76.  We spent the evening buying 50-cent hot chocolate out of a machine and reading copies of  The Independent Trucker  at a small service center outside of the city.  Vitamin B may help counteract depression, studies show.  Jon Robb observed that most American dialects vary in vowel sounds.  Central Pennsylvanians, to whom we are indebted for keeping the price of hot chocolate reasonable, do not sound Southern because of this.  There was a woman traveling in our party, Carrie, who is engaged to Jon Robb.  She procured Tylenol from the bearded Pennsylvanian and told me to knock it off with the hot chocolate and drink hot tea instead.  I felt about hundred times better by the time we were moving again.

       Soma   The correlation between pharmaceuticals as a hugely profitable industry and the relatively new fashion of diagnosing depression and anxiety as a biological 'problem'--instead of a response--just seems a little too convenient.  It's really the medical profession that should be blowing the whistle on the fact that people are unhappy in overwhelming numbers; the sheer scope of it should suggest some external, societal cause.  But that would put doctors in the position of advocating social change.  It's much easier to accept the pseudo-science of the pharmaceuticals, whose everlasting message is that life's problems are biological--not political, social, or economic--in form, and that the solution to our problems lie in a better, more sophisticated drug.

       Anti-War Protesters Finally Enjoy Feelings of Superiority Over Their Pro-War Co-Workers   Anti-war protestors are standing tall in their workplaces this week, as word spreads of former chief weapons inspector David A. Kay's assessment that Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction.  "We were all wrong," he told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week.    "And that means we were all  right ," beamed 24 year old Sara Parks of the Wilmington, DE branch office of Citigroup.  "I can't wait to tell my jackass supervisor."  The news has galvanized many employees to be more vocal about their objections to the war, prompting them to brandish the wide-spread governmental failure as proof that they were right, and, just as crucially, that their pro-war co-workers were wrong.  "I had to listen to this asshole in my department every day about how we were going to kick the shit out of Iraq," said Jacob Hall, a 30 year old programmer at Level3 Communications, Inc. in Denver, CO.  "He's really changed his tune lately, and I'm loving every minute of it."  Dr. Karl Rosen, a psychologist at Miami University of Ohio, examines the coping mechanisms of people who previously supported a war when they learn of its terrific wrong-ness.    "Typically there are two responses, and these can be attributed to two different personality groups.  The first group basically isn't interested, but they go along with it because it's the safest route.  Congress is a good example.  This group will usually retreat from a previously held position when the majority opinion also retreats from it.  The second group is more personally invested in war ideology.  They are more obstinate in their views, kind of like Joseph Stalin.  They will always revert to World War II analogies whenever their contemporary arguments are baseless--which is approximately 200 percent of the time."  Mark Thompson, a 28 year old developer at IBM, explains his own disappointment with the outcome of the war:  "It's terrible to think that after so many Americans have died, and so much money has been wasted, and so many of us have been deceived, now I've gotta hear about it from a bunch of pot-smoking, countercultural posers."  Sara Parks says that even in the midst of a nationwide vindication, it's important for the anti-war crowd not to lose perspective.  "What anti-war people were really protesting wasn't the asinine claim that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the security of the planet, or the fiscal burden our children will have to bear for a bullshit war, or even the catastrophic loss of life that a US led invasion would obviously inflict on Iraqis and Americans alike; it was having to show up to work everyday and suffer the smug jackassery that people who have never had an independent thought in their entire life necessarily impose on their infinitely more enlightened co-workers."

       Peter Jennings Defends Presidential Honor   Peter Jennings charged Michael Moore with being offensive last week, when the documentary filmmaker and author  urlLink endorsed  Democratic presidential candidate Wesley Clark, calling for a "smackdown" debate between "The General" and "The Deserter," President George W. Bush.    "That's a reckless charge not supported by the facts," Jennings told Clark during a nationally televised debate last Thursday.  "According to the United States Army, a missing soldier is considered AWOL until the 31st day of his absence, at which time his status is changed to desertion.  There's absolutely no evidence that our president was absent from service for more than a month at a time.  You should pick your endorsements more carefully, Herr Clark."

        Bush : "Saddam was a really bad man."   President Bush told the country today that Saddam Hussein, while possessing no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, was still an extremely bad person.  "He was bad."    The president's remarks come on the heels of former chief weapons inspector David A.  Kay's declaration that Iraq did not have chemical or biological weapons.  "It turns out we were all wrong," he told the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday.  "Iraq wasn't a threat, unless you consider not having any weapons a threat, in which case the argument could be  made that Iraq was indeed a threat."  Meanwhile, at the White House, the Bush administration has defended their decision to go to war.  "Saddam was bad," President Bush said yesterday.  "He was a dangerous man in a dangerous, Arabic part of the world.  He was a gathering threat to America and others.  He just hadn't gathered very much."  White House spokesman Scott McClellan summarized the administration's position on the war, in light of the recent findings:  "Bad people do bad things, and frequently this has negative effects.  In this case, the United States made the tough decision to fight a man who was bad--weaponless, perhaps--but still, very bad.  While the rest of the world stood united for peace, only a freedom-loving people such as ourselves could make the case for war against a bad, weaponless man.  We weren't afraid to make the hard choices."

        Holy Shit! :  Former Cabinet Member Says Iraq Invasion Planned Pre-9/11   Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill told 60 Minutes yesterday that invading Iraq was a central theme at the very first meeting of the National Security Council--eight months before 9/11.  "It was all about finding a way to do it. That was the tone of it. The president saying 'Go find me a way to do this.'"  "The treasury secretary is not in the position to have access to that kind of information," said one senior White House official.    Except that this treasury secretary disclosed 19,000 internal documents to Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Ron Suskind, whose new book, The Price of Loyalty, comes out tomorrow.   "[O'Neill] got every file from [CIA Director] George Tenet," Suskind says.  One in particular, dated March 5, 2001, and entitled "Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield contracts," includes a map of potential areas for exploration.    “It talks about contractors around the world from, you know, 30-40 countries. And which ones have what intentions,” says Suskind. “On oil in Iraq.”                Read more:   urlLink 60 Minutes    urlLink CNN    urlLink The New York Times    urlLink CNN, two hours ago    urlLink Reuters, one hour ago

        Dear George :  Where is the Terror that You Promised Us?   Since 9/11 George Bush has campaigned on the promise of additional terrorist attacks against US targets.  He created the national color-coded alert system, which allow Americans to experience varying levels of anxiety prior to a potential attack.  But strange as it may seem, the US is hardly ever attacked, unless of course we count the Bill of Rights--but that is another discussion all together.  For now let us content ourselves with the idea that terrorism is not, as Donald Rumsfeld once put it, "an act which involves civilians," but instead, as I like to say, an act by swarthy foreigners of non-Christian descent, who hate us for our a). greatness; b.) freedoms; c.) global benevolence.  Terror was very much in the air this Christmas season, only not in the form of germ warfare on the streets of Philadelphia, where I had hoped to slow the gentrification of my neighborhood.  Instead, it came in the form of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge raising the national alert status to orange, "to send a message to the terrorists of goodwill and resolve."  And yet New Year's came and went, and still no terrorist takers.  This is not to say that terrorists aren't " urlLink everywhere ," or that Al-Queda isn't quietly amassing twenty-five people to blow up something else down the line; but, really, if dying is to be my vocation in this life, I would rather take my chances on I-95 than waste my time waiting for the terrorist lottery to pay off in silver dollars.  I may be something of a cynic, but I think our president holds out a bit too much faith in Al-Queda to undermine the American way of life when his own cabinet has proved themselves so much more capable in this regard.

       Fear   When presented with images of terrifying events, people tend to miscalculate their probability. A single memorable image -- of the World Trade Center collapsing, for example -- will crowd out less visually dramatic risks in the public mind. This explains why people overestimate the frequency of deaths from disasters like floods and fire and underestimate the frequency of deaths from more mundane threats like diabetes and strokes.   How can we protect ourselves from our psychological vulnerabilities? First, we can turn off the TV. A study of psychological responses to 9/11 found that, two months after the attacks, 17 percent of the American population outside New York City reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress related to 9/11. High levels of stress were especially notable in those who watched a lot of television. This anxiety is only heightened by cable networks, which have converted themselves into 24-hour purveyors of alarm.   -- urlLink Jeffrey Rosen

       Chronicles of 'Dis Ent    by  Treebeard    Some time ago I began to wonder how snowmobiliers dared to pass through my woods so freely.  Only lately did I guess a small Bush was to blame, and that long ago his father, the "Great Bush," had been spying out all the ways, and discovering a means to disparage myself and my fellow trees.  He and his foul folk have been making havoc ever since, burrowing their wicked tracks through Yellowstone, and spoiling our air with unregulated canisters of fire.  Brm, hoom!  Good trees, these, and the many others that breathe laboriously under the mischief of this little Bush.  So remote is his wisdom in living things, he sways to power like a sapling to the sun; and like evil he fashions himself under the banner of the righteous and the good, while in truth his purpose is carried on a fell wind.

       8   This Korean girl was extremely attractive, and nude, if you like that sort of thing.  At first she was a great conversationalist.  She told us about how she moved from Korea when she was five, and how she hadn't had a chance to go back.  I got my friend to tell her about the Paul Bunyon incident, and you could tell she was impressed.  It saved him a couple bucks, that's for sure.  She was very easy to talk to, and you wouldn't even notice that she was a stripper, except that your eyes were still open.  That's when the problems started.  Right around the time that my friend was wrapping up the old Paul Bunyon yarn, I should have made him tell the story about the guy playing kickball with the kids in North Korea.  It was just as good a story, and would have been a good follow-up, too.  But the fact of the matter is that I forgot all about it.  The truth is that right around the time my friend was wrapping things up, kickball with the North Koreans was the  last  thing on my mind.  It's a real shame, too, because it gave my friend a chance to choose his own topic of conversation.  The problem with my friend choosing his own topic of conversation was that I already had an idea of what that topic of conversation was going to be.  It was going to be the one that landed us all in the poorhouse.    "So how come everytime I've tried to get your attention tonight you acted like you were in a bad mood?"  "Really?  Well, I've been having a bad night.  You guys have to throw dollars if you want to make a girl's night."    I started to think that maybe she wasn't that great of a conversationalist after all.  "You mean you didn't like the Paul Bunyon story?" I asked.    "Oh sure, hon.  But Paul Bunyon doesn't pay the bills, ya know?"  She started acting very flirty, all of the sudden.  I decided I needed to stabilize the situation.  But before I could stabilize the situation my friend started interrupting with all these expensive ideas of his own, like whether she was dating anyone, or if she would ever date someone who wasn't Korean.  He was on a real high-priced roll, too.    "Well, I have a boyfriend who's from here."  "He's from here," said my friend.  "No, not  here!   I wouldn't date anyone from here."  "You mean you met him in the States?"  "Yes."  "You mean he's American."  "Uh-huh."    "Cool.  So, how much is a lap dance?"

       7   At the same time, it's only natural to pick favorites.  Mine is the German girl for her shiny-poled feats of derring-do.  I'm not normally into blondes, but this girl has talent.  My friend is particular to an Oriental whose background we cannot decide.  She may be Southeast Asian--Cambodian?  She's too dark to be Japanese.  Japanese are whiter than I am--and I sprout cancer on my derma like a vampire.  Oh, by the way, "Oriental" is not an appropriate term to describe a person of Asian descent.  It is used to describe inanimate objects from the region.  (This what my Oriental girlfriend told me in high school--before she told me was pregnant with another man's child.  No, she wasn't, really.  She was Asian.)  It turns out she's Korean.  She's frequently mistaken for Southeast Asian, though, for precisely the reasons we hypothesized.    "Well, I go to tanning salons," she told us.  "Yeah, I was going to say--I went to Korea last summer and people were surprisingly light-complected," my friend said.  "Thank you!"  "You're very beautiful."  "Thank you!"  I decided to interject a less expensive topic into the conversation, on account that my friend was blowing it.  "My friend here is visiting us from Japan for the week."  This had the effect of stabilizing things.  I will tell you one thing that doesn't require stabilization--a 23 year old Korean stripper's breasts.  And I will tell you another thing--you would swear they were Cambodian.

       6   You would think I might be a little self-conscious being poor in a strip club, but it's just like being poor anywhere, except that you feel pressured to give naked women your money.  It didn't bother me too much though.  It wasn't that I didn't have any cash to give either--I had my tax money, after all.  Having lots of money like that usually goes straight to my head--I will buy 100% fruit spread instead of preserves, for example.  That's for my pancakes, which I enjoy every morning.  The thing is, when you enjoy something everyday, like whole-wheat pancakes, it's a lot easier to deny yourself something you never have, like a lap dance.  I'm not even much of a bargain shopper, either.  Even if there was a great deal on lap dances--like three for the price of one--I would probably still be thinking about eating pancakes the following morning.  This is because I am frequently hungry at night.    I don't know what to say about the men in the club.  I cannot know any man well enough who does not long for pancakes after a certain hour, or who by virtue of his station in life is afforded the means to have women disrobe in his presence.  This always seemed to me the purpose of foreign exchange programs, or becoming a congressman.  I just don't understand these men and their disposable income.    It's hard not to judge people in these contexts.  That's when I started thinking about Jesus.  Jesus was a great friend to sex workers in his day, even though I presume nary a lap dance could be rendered in his presence.  Jesus is hard to understand.  He had such a sympathy for people who seemed to do all the wrong things, who had the worst judgment, who had the least redeeming qualities.  These are people who I avoid because they are too petty, too uninspired, because they make poor choices for themselves and have little to offer anyone as a result.  Jesus was constantly doing the opposite of what you would think.  You could walk into a strip club and say to yourself, 'Thank goodness I have nothing to do with this,' and then Jesus would get angry with you while he talked with everyone else.  No wonder the disciples were such a mess.  The best you could do around Jesus was hope to screw up somehow in order to keep his sympathy.

       Untie! 5   It's easy to have strong feelings about sex workers.  I've had some strong feelings about them myself.  My problem is that I can't be in the same room with them when I'm having strong feelings.  I'm not a very natural performer, is what I mean.  I don't mean stripping, I mean being entertained.  Maybe it would be different if there weren't a hundred leering jerks around, but I doubt it.  Even if I was the only leering jerk in the world, I would probably be lousy company.            On my first trip to a strip club, there was this crazy blonde who grabbed my crotch and asked if I was gay.  I told her if I wanted that kind of treatment I would have gone to my senior prom.  One of the problems with being witty in strip clubs is that nobody makes any money off it.  Then this pimp came over and tried take our picture.  He must have thought we had really hit it off, because he was very enthusiastic.  He kept saying that you can't keep a trick, but you can keep the  memories , and then he'd do this little jig where he'd shake his whole body starting from his ankles and going on up to his head.  It was the same crazy clown who announced the girls when they were about to dance.  Very theatrical.  In the meantime, the girl had jumped in my lap and started making faces at the pimp while he hollered "electric!" like a lunatic.  He had this chintzy little Polaroid for which he charged ten bucks a pop.  I didn't even like the girl, so I told them I was broke on account of being a college student.  "Come see me when you've got some bread, son," he said.  The stripper gathered herself and gave me a cold look.  "You may be in school, but you need some smarts."  Show and Tel is much less of a production than the place I went in college.  When we first showed up, I was sort of expecting that kind of experience, with aggressive girls and the shystery staff pimps getting mixed up in everything.  But it was much tamer by comparison.  Maybe three girls approached me in all, with one being a man--and only the man came back after I snubber him once.  Other than that, I had only to avoid eye-contact with the dancers and not yawn too much.  There was a guy announcing the dancers but I never saw him.  There was a bouncer at the door and the rest of us fine gentlemen; but thankfully there weren't too many of us, either.

       Untie! 4   Most of my friend's stories about Japan were pretty good.  He's been teaching English over there since college, and I guess he's got a different perspective on things now that he's made a new life for himself in a foreign land.  For instance, he says that Americans are fat and loud, and that Japanese girls are very subdued.  He's had a couple of Japanese girlfriends so he knows all about that.  The last one just broke up with him not too long ago.  I tried talking to him about her but I couldn't pronounce her name.  So I just let him talk about her.  She was already in a lot of his stories anyway.  One of his best stories didn't have anything to do with Japan.  It was about Korea.  He took a trip there last summer, I think.  Anyway, one of the places he got to visit in Korea was the 38th Parallel, the border between North and South Korea.  He said the South Koreans don't actually run the demilitarized zone--the Americans do.  So his tour guide was an American named Hernandez.  He said Hernandez couldn't answer many questions, but he showed some slides and told this story about something called the Paul Bunyon incident.  The Paul Bunyon incident was something that happened during the cold war, where American soldiers cut down trees in the DMZ so they could stare better at the North Koreans.  That's pretty much all anyone does in the DMZ--stare at Koreans.  The South Koreans stand in Tae Kwon Do stances and stare, in order to intimidate the North.  They're kind of like the Royal Guard in Great Britain.  You can take their picture and climb all over them but they won't budge.  Anyway, the Americans were cutting down these trees so everyone could get a better look at the North.  Then the North told them to knock it off, but the Americans didn't.  So the North took a bunch of axes and hacked down some American soldiers, and that's what history has catalogued under the Paul Bunyon incident.  Hernandez had some black and white slides of it and everything.  It was a pretty good story, we both agreed.      Another thing that was interesting about his tour was that he had to dress up so the North Koreans couldn't take pictures and use it as propaganda, saying that South Korea was poor.  Also there were many tunnels underground where the North tried to invade the South, even though the North says the South tried to invade them.  The South has all these markings showing where the tunneling blasts came from.  Then he told me about how a friend of his actually went to North Korea once and said it wasn't that bad.  I mean, it wasn't as bad as you would think, although it's poor.  His friend said the kids there were nice and he played some games with them and nobody hassled him.  I don't know what he was doing there, and my friend didn't know either.

       Untie! 3   Show and Tel on Delaware Avenue isn't particularly fancy or anything.  It's kind of lame.  But at least it's not dirty or anything like that.  I would say it's probably a middle of the road sort of joint.  It's just a big space, really, with this L-shaped bar where the girls dance.  You have to bring your own beer, though.    The dancing Sunday night was pretty uninspired, except for this German girl who could spin really fast on the pole and hang herself upside down.  She was fun to watch because she was good at it.  My only problem was that whenever she looked at me I had to pretend to be thinking about something else.  So I sat kind of sideways and watched her when she was turned around.    The other girls didn't dance so much as they reclined in your field of vision, at which point you, provided you were not me, threw wads of cash on "them."  My friend also found this objectionable.  So we talked about Japan instead, on account that my friend was visiting from there.

       Sex Workers Untie! 2   For some time I reposed with my compatriot at the bar.  Several strippers engaged our conversation, similarly hoping to exact a breast tax.  My friend provided them with the dollars, but I did not agree to such a tax.  I will tell you a story.  In college I attended a strip club.  It was my first experience.  I was greeted at the interior by a topless woman for whom I harbored no passions.  She intercepted me in her arms and I took hold of her ribs, which were very prominent, I remember.  Then she requested monetary compensation.  I had only just paid to get in.  I was a little low in disposable income.    "I'm sorry," I told the untrustworthy stripper, "I didn't mean to hug you."    "You got somethin' for me, sugar."  She didn't ask me like a question.  She asked me like I  owed  her.  "Well, no, you see that's just the thing.  You guys chiseled me coming in the door.  I didn't have it in mind--"  "You got somethin' for me, sugar."  She hung her head at a very sarcastic angle.  "Well, look, I wasn't very interested in purchasing any of your services, in fact, I didn't even--"  "Hey, Big Daddy, fella here making a fuss."  She was talking to the bouncer.    "We don't want any fuss now, bub," he said, like a real champ.    I retrieved my wallet and gave the door hag her ill-deserved recompense.    This created in me bad faith towards unsolicited stripper-folk who use all manner of chicanery to earn a living.

       Do the Electric Vindaloo!   Last week the Bush administration celebrated the loss of computer jobs to India, saying it would benefit America.  The Indians are really good at computers and they're willing to work for a few dollars a day.  People who studied computers in this country will be losing their jobs.  This is good because American companies will be able to make even bigger profits than they already were.  American companies save a lot of money when they don't hire American.  This week Mr. Bush announced his plan to create American jobs.  The plan will be to retrain laid-off workers for other jobs.  They probably won't be computer jobs, since America won't have as many of those; but there are lots of fast-food jobs available everywhere, and ample opportunity exists for any programmer or systems analyst to work longer hours for less pay and no benefits, with the right training.

       Sex Workers of The World, Untie and Take Over   I cannot tell you the last time I attended a strip club.  Yes I can--it was Sunday night.  But I cannot tell you the last time I attended a strip club other than Sunday night, because I honestly don't remember.  The only thing I remember are the naked women, vividly, as though it were only yesterday.  It was yesterday.  No, it wasn't.    I have a problem with strip clubs, if you can believe that.  My problem is that they are too goddam expensive.  This did not keep me from attending one last weekend, however.  I should tell you the story of how I found myself at Show and Tel last Sunday around midnight.  A friend of mine lost his ornamental Japanese scarf on the Show and Tel premises Sunday afternoon.  He came to me later that night and said, "Will you come with me to retrieve my scarf?"  I said, "Where have you left your scarf?"  He said, "At Show and Tel."  I said, "Okay."  Normally I cannot be found traveling in taxis to strip clubs.  But I should not justify my motives, because that only complicates the story.  Finally we arrived at the strip club.  My friend retrieved his scarf while I waited in the adult materials shoppe.  I had many judgments there.  When my friend returned, he paid for me to enter the ''showroom."  Why did he pay for me to enter the showroom?  Only because I was not prepared to enter the showroom.  I will not say any more about that.    Inside the showroom were many naked women.  I felt very judgmental.  For one, I had no money to contribute to anyone's drug habit.  You witness my judgmentalness.  Also, I imagined being very unpopular amongst the stripper women, because I had no money for them to buy drugs with.  I will stop saying that.  But you should not attend a strip club with no money.  I imagined this fact very prematurely.      My first stripper to approach me was tall and blonde.  She was very attractive.  She told me, "My name is Desire."    "Desire?"  I judged her name very harshly.  "My name is Ryan."  "Do you have something for me?"  She was indicating with her hands that I should insert currency in her breasts.    "No, thank you."   I did not believe in the breast tax, after all.

       Bin Laden's Entire Family Escorted to "Safety" After 9/11    In his new book, Michael Moore investigates business connections between the Bush and bin Laden families, as well as other powerful Saudis such as the royal family, all of whom have extensive US oil-industry investments and business history together.  Immediately following the  9/11 attacks,  The New York Times  reported that Saudi Arabia "supervised the urgent evacuation of 24 members of Osama bin Laden's extended family from the United States,"* even though many maintained close ties to the #1 suspect.  The FBI checked passports, but was otherwise prohibited from detaining or questioning the family.    " Imagine, in the hours after the Oklahoma City bombing, Bill Clinton suddenly started worrying about the 'safety' of the McVeigh family...and then arranged a free trip for them out of the country....  One FBI agent I spoke to told me that the FBI was 'furious' that they were not allowed to keep the bin Ladens to conduct a real investigation--the kind police like to do when they are trying to track down a murderer ."**   Moore also questions the idea that bin Laden was able to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks from a cave in Afghanistan--the official administration claim--when the al Qaeda leader is reportedly suffering serious health problems, including possible kidney and liver failure requiring dialysis; that the 9/11 hijackers were flight school students who hijacked and then flew precision attacks into the World Trade Center and Pentagon buildings, and not perhaps military pilots trained in the Saudi air force, who represent the anti-western faction of a dissolving Saudi power structure, but that Saudi investments in the American economy are so far reaching, and our dependency on their oil so acute, that the US government regularly forgives them their trespasses--funding and sponsoring terrorism being one of the most widely acknowledged.  Consider also the unflagging resistance the White House has displayed to any open inquiry into the 9/11 attacks (yesterday's post).    *Patrick E. Tyler, "Fearing Harm, bin Laden kin fled from US,"  The New York Times , September 30, 2001.  **Michael Moore, "Dude, Where's My Country?," pp. 20-21

       Yay for CBS (News)   Okay, so they didn't air MoveOn.org's ad during half-time because it was inappropriate;   instead they aired Janet Jackson's celebrity teat, which gave its own rousing call for a better America.    The network's news division did cover the complete MoveOn.org  controversy during  Friday's evening program, suggesting to me that someone in the network still cares about the integrity of their own organization--probably quite a few people, in fact, who most likely felt alienated by their own leadership.

       US Press as "Stenographers" for Bush War    This is long but an excellent analysis relating to my entry from March 22 .   urlLink Reuters reports that  the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies released a report on Tuesday slamming the US press for not questioning the arguments put forward by the Bush administration for war, and acting as a virtual stenographer for the White House.  Interestingly, Susan Moeller, the author of the report, argued that "The 'inverted pyramid' style of news writing, which places the most 'important' information first, produced much greater attention to the administration's point of view on WMD issues at the expense of alternative perspectives."  I suppose she means that in an American context, whatever the president says would always go in the first paragraph, and Scott Ritter's comments would come several paragraphs down--even though Ritter knew what he was talking about with regard to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and Bush did not.  The inverted pyramid style is favored in US journalism, but is not necessarily used in other countries. French news columns often are more essayistic, and likewise Arabic news. I spent a year one time mainly putting Arabic-language wire reports into English and arranging them in inverted pyramid form, which is not how they arrived.  While it may be appealing to journalists to try to blame the form of their writing for such lapses, however, there are many better explanations in my view.  1) The US print press is largely a capitalist press, which means you are trying to sell newspapers. (The old saw was that "Anyone can own a newspaper, all you need is a million dollars.) That makes it a reader's press, not a writer's. You have to give readers what they want, or else they won't plunk down their 50 cents. If the mood of the country is such that 85% of the people are supporting a war in Iraq, challenging the need for that war could make the newspaper unpopular and its sales might plummet. Advertisers could also pull their ads from an "unpatriotic" rag.  2) Journalists thrive on access. If you anger the Bush administration, then you are likely to be completely cut off from leaks. There is a strong incentive not to call Bush administration officials liars, if you have to deal with them every day and hope to get more than platitudes from them. This is why Paul Krugman, who is in Princeton and writes abstract analysis of policy that does not depend on insider sources, is such a brilliant dissector of the dishonesty and hypocrisy of the Bushies. He can tell them to jump in the lake.  3) Journalists are mostly generalists. They are talented at pulling information about a new subject out of the experts and putting it together coherently. I worked for a newspaper once and so know a little about how hectic their lives are, and what new challenges they face every day. But the fact is that most American journalists in the fall of 2002 had no idea what Iraq was like, or what a Shiite was, or the difference between an ayatollah and a grand ayatollah. They had no independent means of gauging whether Iraq had a nuclear weapons program or not, and had to go by what the experts said. If you don't follow a place like Iraq for thirty years, as I have, you don't have a good sense of what is plausible and what is not. Then, how do you tell what an expert is? Judith Miller of the NYT thought Ahmad Chalabi looked like an expert--he was a major expatriate Iraqi politician. Khidir Hamza, a former Baathist nuclear scientist looked like an expert. I think the journalists' preference for powerful "insiders" as sources is a problem with the trade. In this case, Scott Ritter was the better source, and even he exaggerated Iraqi WMD.  4) Journalists are often part of the political establishment themselves. Judith Miller is a Neocon who co-authored with the highly unreliable Laura Mylroie, and so was predisposed to buy the nonsense she was fed by Chalabi and his contexts. (The NYT seems to have a fair number of Neocons on its staff, for a supposedly liberal newspaper).  5) Journalism does not practice, or sometimes sufficiently respect, peer review. As editor of the International Journal of Middle East Studies for Cambridge University Press, when I receive an article on Iraq I send it out to five or so of the major experts on Iraq in universities. If they all come back and say it is weak in evidence and argument, I don't publish it. This way of proceeding ensures that articles in my journal are solid. There is no time to referee newspaper articles, though some national magazines, like The Nation, do excellent fact checking. We can contrast academic peer review to the practice at think tanks. The American Enterprise Institute just publishes the book, without peer review. It publishes books that push or support policies to which the think tank is dedicated. This is why silly books like those of Mylroie or Khidir Hamza can see print, and sometimes even sell well. Some journalists do not know the difference between a solid book by Peter Sluglett on Iraq, published by a major academic press, and some screed put out of a Washington think tank by someone who does not know Arabic and has never been in an archive. (I hasten to add that there are lots of real intellectuals in the ranks of journalists, and there are even many former academics, who know these distinctions all too well, but I believe they are a minority). Lee Bollinger at Columbia University is thinking seriously about how this sort of problem could be solved by tinkering with the degree program in journalism there.  I have to say that often when I watch television or read the mainstream press, and I see this parade of self-proclaimed "experts" who say the damnedest things, I feel like Alice in Wonderland. No such shoddy rhetoric or posturing could be gotten away with in my department, but here are people who make literally hundreds of thousands of dollars from peddling unsound information.   The rise of expert and journalistic blogging, and the way it is interacting with professional journalism, may well change these dynamics a bit. Blogging needn't be a capitalist enterprise, and where it is not, it can afford to be more writerly. It can tell readers things at some length that are too complex or controversial for the print media. It can allow voices to be heard that contradict whoever the White House spokesman is that year. It should not be overestimated as a force for change. It is still a relatively minor phenomenon. But at the margins it may begin making a difference.  -- urlLink Juan Cole  at 3/10/2004 07:16:12 AM

       Wealthiest Americans Must Pay More    This letter was published in yesterday's Metro, under the above title (not mine), and in co-ordination with the MoveOn.org initiative to debunk Bush campaign ads as they are aired .  In a new campaign ad, George Bush claims that opponent John Kerry will raise taxes by 900 billion in the first 100 days as president.  In fact, Kerry's proposition is to cut taxes for middle- and lower-income families, while rolling back the Bush tax cuts for families making over $200,000 to pre-Bush rates.    Alternatively, President Bush has cut taxes for upper-income families, raising the cost of living for everyone else.  Think SEPTA fares are too high?  Gas bill?  Tax money can be used to defray the cost of services we all use--but not if the wealthiest Americans don't contribute.

       Saudi Allies   Some of the administration's actions have been so strange that those who reported them were initially accused of being nutty conspiracy theorists. For example, what are we to make of the post-9/11 Saudi airlift? Just days after the attack, at a time when private air travel was banned, the administration gave special clearance to flights that gathered up Saudi nationals, including a number of members of the bin Laden family, who were in the U.S. at the time. These Saudis were then allowed to leave the country, after at best cursory interviews with the F.B.I.  -- urlLink Paul Krugman

       Excerpt of a letter to a Blood-Relative   I just read an article in the New York Times that claimed sedentary lifestyles to be a leading cause of death in the US--just behind smoking.  It's really important to be active; I think it's a shame that the need is not better addressed in our society, along with countless other human needs like meaningful work, scheduling flexibility, or just more free time generally. If you've ever heard of the Israeli "kibbutz"-style of work (basically a communal system), necessary labor and manual tasks are distributed within the community, so that no matter what your professional specialty may be, everyone gets a turn doing these more physical, labor oriented tasks.  Anyway, quite a bit different from what we're used to in the States--although I can't see how we especially benefit from unemployment on one end and the stress-related health problems of working 60 hours a week on the other.  The necessary tasks of any community can be distributed sensibly; if everyone has work then no-one works too much.  It has similar applications for technology, which can be used either to produce in order to provide (people work less and benefit more), or to produce in order to profit (people are replaced by automation in the name of "productivity").  Anyway, just some thoughts on the way our economic system meets our needs as people--or doesn't, as I am inclined to think--including our need for integrated active lifestyles.  The irony is that educated professionals are among those with the least time for exercise.

       Haiti   " Haiti, again, is ablaze...  Almost nobody, however, understands that today's chaos was made in Washington--deliberately, cynically, and steadfastly. History will bear this out ."  --Jeffrey Sachs, professor of economics at Columbia University  The press coverage of Aristide fascinates me.  Here's a former Roman Catholic priest who spent his career campaigning for the poor, who was elected repeatedly by overwhelming majorities; who utilized his nation's resources to fund social services; and who was told last month he could not be protected by American troops and had to either resign or remain unprotected in the country while opposition forces overthrew his government.    The American press has generally cast Aristide as a despot, staying close to the themes offered by the administration as justification for his removal--restoring "democracy" being the most widely invoked.  In this case, American support has been denied the democratically-elected president in favor of an US-selected diplomat who arrived from Florida on Wednesday.  It's important to understand democracy as the fulfillment of US policy goals if we are to understand anything in our own newspapers.

       10   I was too tired to tell about the feminist argument anyway.  It was practically two in the morning, and I couldn't stop yawning.  The place was winding down.  A lot of the girls had stopped dancing and were socializing instead.  My friend was trying to locate the Korean stripper on account that she had disappeared.  Instead, he found this other girl he was already friendly with named Money.  Money had been holding his ornamental scarf when we came back.  She wasn't very Korean--she was Italian--but there was no point arguing about it.  That Korean girl had fled like a refugee, and the place was closing.  Despite her unfortunate moniker, Money didn't know the exchange rate either--and so descended the hand of bitter reluctance upon my wallet.  The going rate, Money said, was ten American dollars for the duration of  one song .  Every fiber of my feminist being grew suddenly taut--and I don't mean that in a good way.    While the kids were out I enjoyed a very brief opportunity to reflect on my experience that evening.  I was still very critical about the stripping enterprise.  I can't help it.  Women should not have to take off their clothes for money--least of all at drafty warehouse spaces along I-95.  Women should take off their clothes for free, at 1210 Ellsworth Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19147.  The road to equality is long--particularly if you are traveling from Northern New Jersey--but well worth the reward.  Real intimacy begins where the conspicuous stain of monetary wealth will never be detected--I live on the third floor, to the rear.

       9   A lap dance at Show and Tel is ten dollars.  Ten American dollars--not yen.  For some reason my friend still had all this yen on him, if you can imagine that.  He'd given away all his American currency in exchange for not having an opportunity to at least have sex with someone.  Anyway, the Korean stripper wouldn't accept yen as payment for a lap dance.  Yen is Japanese, after all, and the stripper was Korean.  It's not all the same to them--even when you insist it should be.  I told my friend to ask for a Japanese stripper instead.  But you could tell he wasn't too hot on that idea, on account that he just broke up with a Japanese girl.  I couldn't blame him, really.  He probably didn't want to risk having his lap danced upon by somebody too much resembling his ex-girlfriend.  She would have to be just Asian enough to create the right effect, though, that's for sure.  That's why I thought it couldn't hurt to ask.        For my part, I was against the whole idea.  It wasn't only because I knew my friend would hit me up for the cash.  It wasn't  only  that, is what I'm saying.  Because the truth of the matter is that I am something of a feminist, actually.  I'm not really a practicing feminist--I haven't been in any parades or anything--but I've dated some girls and I'm pretty up on women's issues, as a general rule.  I'm not afraid to admit it, either.  The only problem with being a feminist is that you can't admit it all the time.  Like when you're hanging around strippers, trying your damndest to be nonchalant on account that you have no money to squander on their services.  That's probably one of the worst times to present the old feminist argument--even though it's probably one of times when you really should.  That's my problem with the old feminist argument.  It always seems like the times when you really should present the old feminist argument are always the worst times to do it.  Anyway, I had a lot of respect for this Korean girl.  I didn't want to see her compromise herself by accepting my American dollars for the entertainment purposes of my friend.  But I knew all too well the old stripper feminist-counter argument.  Strippers have a feminist-counter argument which they will use whenever you try to present them with the old feminist one.  I won't elaborate on the old feminist-counter argument.  I'll just say I knew better than to try to present the old feminist argument, in this particular circumstance.  I didn't trust this Korean stripper enough that she wouldn't bring up the old feminist-counter argument right in my face.  So I just kept the old feminist argument to my damn self, even though it would have been good for everyone to hear it.

       CBS, ABC Join Axis of Evil:  Irresponsible Reporting in Time of War   If you haven't seen the pictures documenting American  urlLink sexual abuse  of Iraqi prisoners, there is one thing you can be certain of:  the entire Arab world has!   While the American response has been overwhelmingly apologetic, I found some gems that best underscore the spirit of compassionate conservatism.         Dear CBS,  Why in God's name would you choose to air such a story at this time? This is something our country didn't need to know now. Everyone in this country is hanging on for dear life to support the troops, and you have taken all our faith in goodness away. How many more reports can we watch like this before support fades?   We are losing our fight with other countries to support us, and now you have just sealed it. ... We've just lost the goal of helping anyone over there because of this show, and God help us. You are no better then those who did these horrible acts. Your reports are bringing down this country.    --Betsy Berra    We really don't know how those prisoners are behaving.... There's a line between heinous war crimes and maintaining discipline .  --Zeenithia Davis, whose husband is allegedly among the soldiers responsible   [The alleged abuses of prisoners were] stupid, kid things — pranks...  And what the [Iraqis] do to our men and women are just? The rules of the Geneva Convention, does that apply to everybody or just us?   --Terrie England   In other news, ABC's  Nightline  will not be aired tonight, at least not on any affiliate stations owned by the  urlLink Sinclair Broadcast Group .  The company has stated that tonight's scheduled program--40 minutes devoted solely to the names and pictures of American soldiers killed in Iraq--" appears to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq ."  Instead, the company will be airing an alternative piece explaining how freedom of information is a threat to the homeland, and that large corporate conglomerates are in a unique position to decide what should not be viewed by the American public.

       The Hellarity       This week the Bush administration appointed their former top UN diplomat, John Negroponte, as the new US ambassador to Iraq.  The appointment was detailed on the website of the  urlLink Coalition Provisional Authority , including a cropped picture of Negroponte speaking before one of the world's greatest anti-war works of art--Pablo Picasso's  Guernica .  The photo dates from February 5th, 2003, when Negroponte and Secretary of State Colin Powell were dispatched to make the case for war in Iraq, including Powell's now-famous, Iraq-definitely-has-weapons of mass destruction speech.   Particularly interesting are reports that the  urlLink painting was covered  before the conference under dubious pretense; the fact that this shot was somehow managed and now appears on the provisional government's website suggests a comic conspiracy of the highest order.  (Of special note:  a FOX News microphone in the foreground; Negroponte's sinister countenance.  Priceless.)

       Letter to the Editor:  Bush Eliminates Overtime    This letter will probably appear in tomorrow's Metro .  This week the Bush administration will introduce new rules making millions of workers ineligible for overtime when they work more than 40 hours a week.  After nine-months of public pressure, Bush scrapped his initial plans and introduced revisions exempting police, firefighters, and other first responders from the cuts.  Now the administration is selling the cuts as an "extension" to this sector of the workforce, with several newspapers suggesting a policy-reversal.  This is not an honest characterization of the new rules, under which many of us will lose our overtime rights.

       6   In spite of a flawed dinner strategy, I was happy to support America's new manufacturing sector.  President Bush had truly demonstrated his commitment to making sure that every American who wants work can find a job.  Unwilling to ignore the export of manufacturing jobs to the unregulated havens of the third-world, the president vowed to create more manufacturing jobs at home.  This began with 2004's famous Economic Report of the President, which asked the hard question, "What is Manufacturing, Anyway?"; and continued with exhaustive scientific inquiries into the qualitative difference between a fuel-injector and a big mac.  The findings confirmed what everyone in the administration already suspected:  Americans still make big macs.  And because the government had subsidized the export of real manufacturing to other nations, the report rightly notes that "the definition of what constitutes manufacturing is far from clear."       Millions of new manufacturing jobs could be generated instantaneously, if only we as Americans were prepared to let go of our outdated ideas about high-wages and good benefits, and embrace a new epoch of "productive flexibility."  Unions are an anachronism--appropriate at one time, perhaps, but no longer needed in a post-industrial economy in which all antagonisms between corporations and their employees have been transcended, under the guiding principle of not thinking critically, and that success "is an attitude!"

       5   By the time I finished my meal I was thoroughly disgusted.  I thought maybe the double-cheeseburger or the quarter-pounder with cheese would have been a better choice.  It definitely would have been a better value, considering that I can only afford McDonald's once or twice a year.  The only good thing about it all was that I got to drink root beer.  But then I started worrying about diabetes, which runs in my family.  When you spend a lot of time alone you can't help but become a kind of hypochondriac.  I kept imagining limbs jettisoning themselves from my body.  I have a pretty vivid imagination, especially when it comes to diabetes-related health complications.    It was Friday night and I didn't have any plans.  When you are under-employed all day like I am, the last thing you want to do on Friday night is have plans.  My only serious commitment was making sure nobody knew I was home.  There was additional 9/11 commission testimony I was dying to see, in particular Richard Clarke.  For me, C-SPAN.org on a Friday night is the height of indulgence.  I had already watched Condoleezza Rice several times, and judged her harshly.  For one thing, she was constantly smiling.  Condoleezza Rice is an attractive woman, but for anyone to smile that much indicates to me that she's working for the wrong side.  Of course, I don't mean that in a partisan way.  I mean when Satan took her to the parapet of the temple and told her that she could have all the kingdoms of the world if only she would bow down and worship him, she submitted her application for National Security Adviser.  I'm not suggesting that George Bush is the devil.  I'm saying Mr. Cheney has no business at that height with his heart condition.

       4   I got pretty depressed over my dinner.  But then these were depressing times.  The government had sold everyone a real bill of goods on the whole going to war idea.  They hoped it would be a cure to the Vietnam syndrome.  The Vietnam syndrome was where everyone figured out what a scam war is, and how eager governments are to get their people killed for political reasons.  So, for a long time America was afflicted with the Vietnam syndrome, which was really just a variety of good sense.  It was the policy planners who called it a syndrome, because it obstructed a military solution to international problems.  For many years a lot of energy was invested in curing the syndrome, and getting Americans back to a place where they would support actions that put their families in harm's way for the benefit of others.  This has been the function of war through history--to maintain or expand positions of privilege for the decision-makers at the expense people who aren't the decision-makers.  Of course, no war has ever been sold in such explicit terms.  At the Nuremberg trials, Gustave Gilbert, an intelligence officer, interviewed Nazi officer Hermann Goering on effectively selling a war:    Goering :  Why, of course the people don't want war.  Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?  Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.    Gilbert :  There is one difference:  In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.    Goering :  Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

       3   Things were going terribly in Iraq, but much worse for me at McDonald's.  I couldn't figure out what I wanted.  Not only that, there was nobody in line.  I had to look like a jackass for an interminable period.  Finally, I ordered Chicken McNuggets, specifically because of mad cow disease.  This was my special night out, after all.  I wasn't about to have it ruined by worrying over the avian flu.    I sat in the corner with my back to the wall, like the time I lost my virginity.  I was oppressed by the sun.  It was shining directly on my meal.  I would have moved but I didn't want to want to give up my station.  It was a prime vantage point over the whole place.  The reason why I wanted a prime vantage point was so I could assess any employment opportunities, should they arise.  Only I couldn't see too many employment opportunities on account that the goddam sun was shining all over my food.  I would have put my sunglasses back on but I had already eaten a fry; I had laid my glasses on the napkins because I didn't want them to touch the table.  Finally I discovered that by using the condensation from my soda I could clean my hands and emerge from this impossible quandary.  But that was only much later, after the ice had started to melt.

       2   I'm really pretty lousy on the whole war thing.  I know I've got the wrong attitude, but I don't care.  First of all, war is dangerous.  People get killed doing that shit.  Look at Iraq.  It's like a war over there.  The administration calls it a 'robust insurgency.'  Either way, Dick Cheney doesn't need me running around with rifle, getting shot at for Halliburton.  Actually, that's exactly what he needs.  Checks from Halliburton don't write themselves, after all.  My question is:  What do I have in common with Dick Cheney?  This guy made over a million dollars last year, and he wants to me to run into Falluja with a rifle?  I would have more in common with the people trying to kill me--and by that I don't mean Dick Cheney.  McDonald's has changed dramatically since the end of major combat operations in Iraq.  For one thing, there is no two-cheeseburger extra-value meal anymore.  It's just not there.  Now a number two is a quarter-pounder with cheese.  A number three is a double-cheeseburger.  They don't have the skimpy cheeseburgers with the onion shavings and the one slice of pickle anymore.  They all have tomatoes and lettuce and all these vegetables on them like you're at Wendy's.  I guess it's part of the whole "healthy" McDonald's scam--like the elimination of the "super-size" option (because it's too much for people to resist an unhealthy bargain when they see one).  In a word, lame.  The other thing that struck me was the cost.  These new meals are all the same price--$4.19, with a tax that puts them around $4.50.  That's outrageous for a meal which won't even reach the 2000 calorie threshold like the old super-size deals would.  I never ate the supersize meals because my stomach is exceedingly small.  (Think of the ratio of time Bush has spent acting as President vs. time spent clearing brush on his ranch.  That small.)  But that's not the point.  I used to be able to eat an affordably priced two cheeseburgers with fries and not experience hunger for 36 hours.  The new, healthy McDonald's did not yield a similar value, as we will soon see.

       Depressed After Condi, I Treat Myself to Dinner Out    Having nothing else to do, I secured transport after work to McDonald's for my evening repast.  I do not eat McDonald's nearly as much as a should, I decided on the way, since for a poor person it is a fine way to meet one's caloric goals for the weekend.  The truth is that I've lost a lot of weight since Condi's testimony--I'm afraid it didn't go half as badly as I had hoped--and most of what's left to lose is bone marrow, skeletal  features by now.  Also, I frequently romanticize McDonald's as a source of future employment, if my faith-based trend of social climbing downward is ever going to pay off.  So I go from time to time, just to invigorate my sense of purpose.  The last time I visited McDonald's, American forces in Iraq had only recently gained control of Baghdad.  Chief White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer oozed about the "unquenchable" taste of freedom, which reminded me of the daydreams I once had in 6th grade about Chicken McNuggets.  It was newly warm in South Philly, and patriotism was just a sports-bra away from something I could feel genuinely good about.  Tragically, my rabidly partisan hatred for our president spoiled my sharing in the experience.  But nothing spoils a two-cheeseburger extra-value meal, or the solid mass it becomes in the daily Baghdad of the digestive track.

       Bush Creates New Manufacturing Sector   Job opportunities in the American manufacturing sector are experiencing a revival this year, thanks to a new Bush administration initiative to rethink the meaning of blue-collar work.    "The definition of a manufactured product is not straightforward," states the annual Economic Report of the President.  "When a fast-food restaurant sells a hamburger, for example, is it providing a 'service' or is it combining inputs to 'manufacture' a product?"    Traditionally, manufacturing has been defined as anyone "engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products."  But the report notes that many convenient marts and fast-food chains now possess the technology to manufacture products which previously were best attempted in industrial settings only.  One example, the hi-tech  McGriddles  breakfast sandwich, features a McDonald's-patented syrup-infused bread-roll, which boasts real maple-syrup flavoring without the inconvenience and mess of conventional syrup applicators.  "The McGriddle has a reputation for being capital-intensive because of its advanced assembly process," a senior-level McDonald's spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal last week.  "But, ultimately, baking a controlled syrup-flavoring into the bun cuts costs when compared to the interminable handing-out of syrup packets."  The assembly-line method of McDonald's food production seems to fit well with the Bush administration plan to reinvent a new manufacturing sector.       "If mixing water and concentrate in a Chinese factory to produce soft drinks is classified as manufacturing," White House spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters Tuesday, "why shouldn't the American who renders the beverage to end-users share the same benefit and prestige of a manufacturing position as his Chinese counterpart?"

       Army War College Speech Gets Warm Reception From Last 28 Remaining Military Personnel in US      President Bush's 33-minute address at the United States Army War College yesterday was received with enthusiasm by the last 28 remaining military personnel in the United States.  The audience, unhindered by small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades, applauded the president's bold plan for bringing democracy to Iraq by striking the palms of their not-yet severed hands together in rapid succession.    "We are here because the president has not yet condemned us to the violent death and dismemberment which surely awaits us in Iraq," said 23-year old staff sergeant Cornelius McPhearson.  "Unlike our fellow soldiers who have gone before us, we still possess the limbs and extremities necessary to applaud the president's forward march into violence."  The president's primary message, underscored by the nuanced body language afforded him by a full set of unsevered presidential limbs, was one of steadfastness in the face of adversity.  "The struggle for freedom is never easy.  The dark hand of tyranny   is always in tact, even when temporarily cleaved from its master.  This stands in stark contrast to the human hand, which does not do so well on its own."  The president then added, snapping his fingers to rapturous applause, "I'm really glad I have both of mine."

      I have always been a great advocate of old people.  Old people may not be the most popular people in the world, but they are often times the nearest death.  This means if you don't like a person, just wait long enough and you won't have to sit through their next State of the Union address.  This works equally well when you are aged, and you grow weary of emptying your bowels all over The National Review.  As Gandhi once said, "the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts, or falling off bicycles in your soul."   I appreciated Barry's close relation in a way that he obviously did not.  I smiled politely and nodded my head as the little man entered into all manner of wild gesticulation over the possibility that he would be disappointed by the new Spiderman release.  I enjoyed hearing the critical perspective of one who walked the tightrope of existence in the way young people pass venereal disease.

       FIRE RUMSFELD   The time has come to knock Donald Rumsfeld from the top of the all-male nude pyramid once and for all.    "Beginning more than two years ago, Mr. Rumsfeld decided to overturn decades of previous practice by the U.S. military in its handling of detainees in foreign countries. His Pentagon ruled that the United States would no longer be bound by the Geneva Conventions; that Army regulations on the interrogation of prisoners would not be observed; and that many detainees would be held incommunicado and without any independent mechanism of review... Mr. Rumsfeld's decisions helped create a lawless regime in which prisoners in both Iraq and Afghanistan have been humiliated, beaten, tortured and murdered -- and in which, until recently, no one has been held accountable." -  urlLink The Washington Post   "It is time now for Mr. Rumsfeld to go, and not only because he bears personal responsibility for the scandal of Abu Ghraib. That would certainly have been enough. The United States has been humiliated to a point where government officials could not release this year's international human rights report this week for fear of being scoffed at by the rest of the world." - The New York Times, May 7, 2004, New York, New York  "Rumsfeld Must Go."  - Boston Globe, May 7, 2004, Boston, Massachusetts  "It is time for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to prepare the final document of a long and sometimes illustrious public career: his letter of resignation." - The Plain Dealer, May 7, 2004, Cleveland, Ohio  "The reality is that, if Bush is going to clean house, it makes no sense to stop with Rumsfeld. Considering how the Bush administration has made a mess of the situation in Iraq - from the wrong intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to the incredible lack of planning for the post-war situation to the entirely unnecessary alienation of allies - the whole national security team should be fired." - Newsday, May 7, 2004, New York, New York  "Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, should resign immediately. If they do not, they should be fired." - Star Tribune, May 7, 2004, Minneapolis, Minnesota  "This is not the first time we've called for the removal of Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary. Only Rumsfeld or the president can assure that it's the last." - Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 6, 2004, Seattle, Washington  "Donald Rumsfeld has to go. The secretary of Defense should tender his resignation to President George W.

      We were entering our descent into the Lincoln Tunnel when my companion regained consciousness.  The little man at our left began speaking excitedly.  "You had a nice nap, Barry," he said.  "Too much ice cream and beer last night," Barry replied.  "What did you say, Barry?"  "I said too much ice cream and beer last night."  The little man seemed pleased.  "Oh, ha-ha.  You must feel rested after your nap.  Boy, you must have been asleep for a good twenty minutes or so by my watch."  "I usually feel worse," Barry said.    Immediately I detected the eagerness the little man displayed in speaking had been met with a corresponding reluctance on the part of his much younger relation.  "I didn't see any movies this weekend.  I wanted to see Van Helsing--are you familiar with that title, Barry-- Van Helsing ?  Yes?  Well, I thought I might see that, but the  reviews were terrible.  I just thought it might be interesting  since it's based on a character from the first Dracula movie.  You probably didn't know that, did you?  Had you ever heard of him, Barry--Van Helsing?  He was a character in  the original Dracula story; I know you probably never saw the original Dracula movie; that was before your time, sure.  Anyway, I thought it might be interesting, but the reviews were terrible, Barry."  Barry could very well have written his graduate thesis on the  contemporary bastardization of Hollywood classics, but he would be damned if he were to broadcast his opinion on the subject for the benefit of the Shortline commuters into Manhattan.  Women were turning in their seats.   Women , for crying out loud!  He made a heroic effort to read his newspaper, but the little man would not be subdued.

       Spectre of Colin Powell's Blackness Haunts Cable News Circuit   Might Secretary Powell's conscience be the sword on which the Bush administration falls?  From  urlLink Juan Cole/Informed Comment :  By now most persons with a television and an interest in US affairs will have seen the bizarre scene in which Deputy Press Secretary Emily Miller, an aide to Colin Powell, attempted to pull him off camera and stop him from answering a question put by Tim Russert of Meet the Press. What is bizarre is that she actually tried to lie to Powell and convince him that Russert had finished the interview. If I were Powell, I'd try to find out for whom she is really working. When Powell told her to get out of the way and came back on camera, he made a startling admission, in bold, below.       MR. RUSSERT: Thank you very much, sir.      In February of 2003, you put your enormous personal reputation on the line before the United Nations and said that you had solid sources for the case against Saddam Hussein. It now appears that an agent called "Curve Ball" had misled the CIA by suggesting that Saddam had trucks and trains that were delivering biological chemical weapons.      How concerned are you that some of the information you shared with the world is now inaccurate and discredited?      SECRETARY POWELL: I'm very concerned. When I made that presentation in February 2003, it was based on the best information that the Central Intelligence Agency made available to me. We studied it carefully. We looked at the sourcing and the case of the mobile trucks and trains. There was multiple sourcing for that. Unfortunately, that multiple sourcing over time has turned out to be not accurate, and so I'm deeply disappointed.      But I'm also comfortable that at the time that I made the presentation it reflected the collective judgment, the sound judgment, of the intelligence community,  but it turned out that the sourcing was inaccurate and wrong and, in some cases, deliberately misleading . And for that I'm disappointed, and I regret it.    Powell for the first time has gone beyond admitting that the intel on Iraq WMD was inaccurate to calling some of it deliberately misleading. If it was deliberately misleading, however, that implies that someone deliberately misled. That is, there are human actors with intentions. If a government official deliberately misled Powell on this matter, that is clearly a crime that should be prosecuted.  So, will the other shoe now drop? Is Powell laying the groundwork for an impeachment of Douglas Feith or Paul Wolfowitz?

      At some point in our trek my companion became unconscious in his newspaper.  It was probably just as well.  The enterprising gentleman had little to learn from the likes of The New York Post, unless it was game stats or a crash course in not-thinking critically.  In Philadelphia we suffer under the malevolent reign of the Daily News, which is sort of like intellectual crack for working people.  As I watched the sun set over my companion's tripe-induced slumber, I wondered if the price we pay for literacy isn't just a more respectable form of ignorance.  William Safire, for instance.

      Of my riding companion there would be little else to report were it not for the presence of another passenger--the one that would finally provoke him.  This strange little character sat to our left, alternately balling himself up with clenched teeth and double fists; then relaxing, craning his head into the aisle and smiling at us reverentially.  I attributed this unusual behavior to old age, and did not expect anything to be meant from his pointed curiosity.    One of the finer points of public transportation is that it allows for productive work in the time one would normally be driving.  To this end I rather enjoy a long commute.  I had with me a collection of historical documents that dated back to Reconstruction; indeed, the first was a report by an agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, who had been tasked to administer relief  for those displaced by the war and initiate programs aimed at the peaceful integration of former slaves into the economy of the south.  In reviewing the period one cannot escape the elemental role the federal government played in safeguarding the welfare of southern blacks against violence sanctioned by the localities.  It's the same message, repeated a half-century later, by John Steinbeck in  The Grapes of Wrath :  The collusion of local authorities with wealthy landowners creates a unique need for federal intervention on behalf of starving Midwestern families who flooded California during the Great Depression.

      This occasion afforded me prompt service into the city, however.  I sat next to a young man of stout build who was invested in the pages of some local rag--the New York Post, probably.  I must say the entire positioning of his body did betray the earnestness he applied to this end; as such I contented myself in leaving him undisturbed.  Still, I could not help but think it strange his single-minded attempt to read, or more precisely, his physical interpretation of it--slung into the corner like a recalcitrant fetus.

       How the French Saved America   Last night I departed northern New Jersey, and the residence of my family, for an evening's ride into New York.  Naturally I did not drive.  My parents deposited me at the nearest Shortline bus terminal, amidst a throng of offspring equally deposited by their parents, and so on and so forth.  We had all come home to celebrate the holiday; now we all purposed a singular return to our underfed, motherless lives.  In years past this has made for high entertainment:  two hour delays, buses filled to standing capacity, and the unflagging impulse to throttle one's peers lest their plaintive, cellular-whines endure a solitary moment longer.  (Bear it in mind that, as regards New Yorkers, the cellular phone is an abuse far surpassing the all-male nude pyramid--not to be mistaken with the all-female nude pyramid, which not only is an altogether different sort of torture, it's jaw-droppingly naive.)

       Bringing Back the Draft    From the   urlLink Hearst News Service :  The Selective Service System's chief has proposed registering women for the military draft and requiring that young Americans regularly inform the government about whether they have training in niche specialties the armed services need.  The proposal, which the agency's acting director, Lewis Brodsky, presented to senior Pentagon officials just before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, also seeks to extend the age of draft registration to 34 years old, up from 25.  The plan, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, highlights the extent to which agency officials have planned for an expanded draft in case the administration and Congress authorize one.  "In line with today's needs, the Selective Service System's structure, programs and activities should be re-engineered toward maintaining a national inventory of American men and, for the first time, women, ages 18 through 34, with an added focus on identifying individuals with critical skills," the agency said in a Feb. 11, 2003, proposal presented to senior Pentagon officials.

       Hearts and Minds   If there's one thing suggestive of a losing proposition in Iraq, it's been underscored by public reaction to US abuses of the prisoners in their care:  Americans have minimized the importance by framing it against their larger, noble purpose; while Arabs have carried it to the conclusion that the US is no better than Saddam Hussein.  " They keep asking why we hate them? Why we detest them? Maybe they should look well in the mirror and then they will hate themselves ," said Khadija Mousa from Syria.   Abdel-Bari Atwan, editor of the pan-Arabist London newspaper, al-Quds al-Arabi, said, " The liberators are worse than the dictators. This is the straw that broke the camel's back for America . . . "That really, really is the worst atrocity. It affects the honour and pride of Muslim people. It is better to kill them than sexually abuse them ."  Professor Juan Cole of the University of Michigan writes:   " I really wonder whether, with the emergence of these photos, the game isn't over for the Americans in Iraq. Is it realistic, after the bloody siege of Fallujah and the Shiite uprising of early April, and in the wake of these revelations, to think that the US can still win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi Arab public ?"  For America, this war has been too wrapped up in an emotional response to 9/11 and the need for revenge, combined with the need to feel self-righteous and noble while acting it out.  As Americans, we don't understand Iraqis or care particularly for their plight, unless we get to congratulate ourselves for doing so every step of the way.  What is significant about Fallujah and the pictures of abuse is that it obstructs our ability to congratulate ourselves.  Our own opinion of ourselves is high so long as we are sheltered from the realities of war--but take the illusion away and we are instantly demoralized.  We have barely begun to grasp the reality of our own dead; I think it's more than fair to say that we are completely uninterested in the thousands of Iraqi dead, which our government feels no obligation even to keep count.    It's tragically striking to me how self-centered this operation has been.  We were arrogant enough to believe that we could do something without anyone else's input or approval, just because of our high opinion of ourselves.  Now reality is sinking in:  our children our being killed and the Iraqis appear ungrateful.  We feel bad about abuse pictures.  Maybe we don't want to be there at all anymore.  We tried, but the Iraqis let us down.  It wasn't our fault.  The world just wasn't ready for democracy.

       Fahrenheit Letter   Michael Moore's new film became part of the national dialogue this weekend.  If Fahrenheit 9/11 is hot, it's because it's showing us something--about government, about war, and about ourselves.  The film contains footage unlike anything Americans have seen in depth: the day to day experiences of combat soldiers in Iraq, the anguish of Iraqis who blame the US for the deaths of their loved ones, the anxieties of American military families who now question the war, the rehabilitation of American soldiers who have lost their limbs.  And while Moore makes his own observations on the meaning behind it all, I fail to see how the real lives and experiences of American soldiers count in any way as "propaganda."  The freest nation in the world shouldn't have to rely on a single man to show us what's actually happening in Iraq.

       Letting The Terrorists Win: A Plan To Keep Our Heads   I like my head.  And since there is no obvious advantage to having it separated from my body, I say let the terrorists win.  I realize it would set a bad precedent.  Terrorist forces the world-over would rejoice.  They would forever hold the mantle of being less pissed-off over the not severed heads of all Americans.  They would go back to their old jobs, like being unemployed, or starving peaceably.  But though we may be two nations, are not our goals one and the same?  Do not the terrorists pray for the immediate return of Americans to their homes and loved ones?  And do not the Americans, in turn, enjoy the full use of their heads?  Then let not our differences come between us--or, for that matter, our cutlery.  For it is written: "The man who sows his own crop will yield a bountiful harvest, but the man with no head should never drive a tractor..."  My countrymen are a proud people.  With their pride they will never part.  Unless, of course, the only alternative is their head.  After all, while pride is important, a missing head can limit your home purchasing prospects dramatically.  And try finding a reasonably priced apartment in Queen's Village anyway.    Some may call this defeatist, perhaps.  But as Jesus once said, "let he that is without his head be the first to cast a stone..."  And so I say, let America's pride be harnessed for the highest order of defeat: Don't let America lose its head!

There are no such things as "precision strikes" in residential neighborhoods. Bombs not only throw off shrapnel themselves, they create lots of deadly flying debris, including flying glass from broken windows, that can kill and maim.

       Reagan's Legacy   A letter written to The New York Times in 1998:   To the Editor:  The most striking characteristic of the network financed and organized by Osama bin Laden is that it is made up almost entirely of Ronald Reagan's "freedom fighters," the Islamic fundamentalists armed and trained by the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1980's in an effort to drive Soviet forces out of Afghanistan (front page, Aug. 24).  This network received $6 billion in United States- and Saudi-financed arms shipments in the 1980's.  Perhaps the Clinton national security team should devote some time to the overarching question of how to make it harder for networks like Mr. bin Laden's to operate.  At a minimum that would mean eliminating the kind of covert arms operations we ran with such abandon in the 1980's.  William D. Hartung New York, Aug. 24, 1998   The writer is a senior research fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School.

       The American Tradition   Which leads me to my next question: Where has American conservatism gone?   The American tradition from the revolutionary period to the present has been fixated on the dangers of power, and on the tendency of power to corrupt. And it has been quite explicit on the kind of corruption it feared. Either the state apparatus would become an aristocracy in its own right, from the love of power and privilege, or it would function in the interests of an aristocracy of corporations and moneyed interests.  -  urlLink Antiwar.com

       Anarchism    The core of the anarchist tradition, as I understand it, is that power is always illegitimate, unless it proves itself to be legitimate. So the burden of proof is always on those who claim that some authoritarian hierarchic relation is legitimate. If they can't prove it, then it should be dismantled.  -  urlLink Noam Chomsky   I wanted to say something brief about anarchism since I added the  Traditions  portion of the sidebar.  First, I really recommend the interview with Chomsky hyperlinked there.  It's one of the most accessible summaries of anarchism as a tradition, particularly within the US, that I have been able to find.  Secondly, it  is  an established intellectual tradition--not the amorphous blob of lawlessness and chaos that typically comes to mind.  There are about a million synonymous terms for it--syndicalism, libertarianism, libertarian-socialism, democratic socialism, anarcho-communism, etc.--each with their own history and meaning, but only worth knowing if you're really interested.  The elementary idea is that people should have meaningful control over their lives, and that means democratic control of both political and economic institutions.  As Americans, we already understand the political side of this.  Representative democracies operate on the idea that people control their government democratically.  They are designed to facilitate control of the political process through elected representation and by personal protections such as civil rights.  This is a central component of a libertarian, or anarchist, outlook.  The second component, however, is economic.  Democratic control of one's workplace, for instance, is barely acknowledged, even on a theoretical level, within the United States.  Corporations are authoritarian in structure, not democratic.   The only democratic control people have over private institutions comes either from the political process in the form of government regulation, or from work agreements achieved through   employee organizing (trade unions).  Anyone interested in increasing popular control over production and resources will quickly find themselves at odds with the "right" to private ownership of these things on which all of us rely for survival.

       Remembering Reagan's Racism   One of my black colleagues called Ronald Reagan a racist today.  Normally I reserve that term for special people--like Jesse Helms or Strom Thurmond--who seem to embrace the philosophy in public ways.  Because racism is so much a part of American culture and history, it's also a part of all Americans--if not in who we are, then certainly in how we behave.  If you presume a certain amount of latent racism in every American, then the term "racist" can be meaningfully preserved for only the most special of individuals.    Having failed to review the Reagan record, I initially lumped the Great Communicator in with the rest of us--well, very broadly, anyway.  Within the spectrum of racially-conditioned America, there are those who work to confront racism, and there are those who do nothing.  At best, I thought, Mr. Reagan--white, male, wealthy, Republican--did nothing.  As I told my co-workers when the debate began, "I don't know if I would call him racist.  I would say he didn't care."  Then my co-worker, "Abe"--a Liberian emigre--ran down the record.  First of all, Reagan initially opposed the creation of a Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, calling the civil rights leader a "trouble-maker."  I personally did not know this.  Another black co-worker, Greg, asked Abe how this made Reagan a racist.  Abe told him it was "clear as day."  This was not a satisfactory response for Greg.  I sensed Abe missed the sincerity of Greg's interest, misinterpreting it as a dismissal, so I tried to explain why Abe had a strong argument, since Martin Luther King, Jr. has come to personify for most Americans the goals and achievements of the civil rights movement.  For Ronald Reagan to dismiss this as "trouble-making" indicated to me that he either opposed the goals of the civil rights movement--making him a very special kind of racist--or he simply didn't understand their significance, being completely insulated from the black American experience his entire life.  I still felt myself leaning towards the latter, wanting to give the newly corpsified president the benefit of the doubt before branding him a racist.    I repeated my opinion of the former president not caring enough about black people to understand their history.    "I don't know," Greg told me.  "He sounds pretty racist."   The second point Abe articulated in the case against Reagan related to his dealings with the very racist South African government in the 1980's, and its program of racial segregation--apartheid.  I'm telling you these goddam Jim Lehrer tributes to Ronald Reagan can really fuck with your head:  I had completely forgotten about apartheid.  Anyway, if hating Martin Luther King, Jr., isn't enough, supporting a blatantly racist government and refusing to participate in its international embargo should tell you something about Ronald Reagan's opinion of colored people.   So there you have it.  Ronald Reagan, a very special racist.  Who knew?    A comprehensive analysis of Reagan's special brand of racism can be explored in this  urlLink MSNBC article .

       Remembering Reagan  (cont.)  They had worked hard in junior and senior high school, harder than most, but none of that mattered now. President Reagan, explained the form letters from the Office of Financial Aid, had slashed the federal education budget. Which is why the same grim tableau of shattered hopes and dreams was playing itself out across the country. Colleges and universities were evicting their best and brightest, straight A students, stripping them of scholarships. Some transferred to less-expensive community colleges; others dropped into the low-wage workforce. Now, nearly a quarter century later, they are still less financially secure and less educated than they should have been. Our nation is poorer for having denied them their potential.  -  urlLink Ted Rall

A number of news sources have already proclaimed Mr. Reagan the most popular president of modern times. In fact, though Mr. Reagan was very popular in 1984 and 1985, he spent the latter part of his presidency under the shadow of the Iran-Contra scandal.

       The Prisoner Abuse "Not So Bad" Syndrome   If you're like me, you work with people who don't mind a little prisoner molestation from time to time.  After all, if knocking a few scrotums together prompts the testes to name names, then the cause of liberty is well-served.  And even if the Red Cross estimate that 70-90% of the inmates were ordinary people picked up off the street, well, "All's fair in love and war," one colleague told me.  "Didn't some feminist say that?"  Scrota-knockery, here we come.    "The American public needs to understand, we're talking about rape and murder here. We're not just talking about giving people a humiliating experience; we're talking about rape and murder and some very serious charges," said Sen. Lindsay Graham, the distinguished  Republican from South Carolina, after viewing the pictures the rest of us are waiting to be leaked to the press...  The other thing my peers like to ask is why American soldiers are held to a different standard than terrorists.  After all, if the terrorists are "allowed" to run willy-nilly through the streets of Baghdad setting off road-side bombs, why can't we build nude pyramids and grab a fistful of gonads when it suits us?  Well, because we're  not fucking terrorists , dude!  We're  supposed  to be held to a different standard.  A non-raping standard, for instance.  A non-murdering standard, imagine.  A non-sodomizing standard, at least  urlLink not when it's coming out of my goddam paycheck   every week.  The difference between terrorists and American soldiers is that we, as members of a democratic nation,  are responsible for the behavior of our government .  Not fair you say?  You're goddam right it's not.  Neither is pulling the slack of your co-workers when they want to bullshit about sports all afternoon.  So what's more important?  Honoring your own standards or competing for dominance by somebody else's?

       Humanitarian Interventions?   Genuine humanitarian intervention would often be a good thing. And it is often quite easy. Right now there is much soul-searching and self-flagellation on the 10th anniversary of the Rwanda massacre, when the West would not intervene to stop it. For 100 days, people were killed at the rate of about 8000 a day. That happens be about the number of children who die every day in Southern Africa from easily treatable diseases. That's Rwanda-level killing every day, not for 100 days, but constantly. And it's far easier to stop than sending troops to Rwanda. All that's necessary is to spend pennies a day to bribe drug companies to produce the needed remedies, instead of doing what they are required to do by law: maximize profits by producing "life-style drugs" for the rich rather than life-saving drugs for the poor. That would suffice to stop ongoing Rwanda-style killing--again, not just for 100 days, and just among children in one region. Is anyone doing it? What does that tell us about the alleged humanitarian concerns over Rwanda? Or  urlLink Darfur ? Or... What it tells us, loud and clear, is that humanitarian concerns are wonderful as long as it's someone else's crimes and we do not have to do anything about them apart from striking heroic poses.  - from  urlLink Turning the Tide , the Noam Chomsky Weblog

       Bush Cuts Hurt Philly    urlLink     To the Editor:  One of the biggest scandals of the Bush administration is playing out all across Philadelphia this summer: the city wants to close eight fire engine and ladder companies.  Some of these firehouses have served our community for more than 100 years.  How exactly, in our post-9/11 world, with firefighters being our first line of defense against domestic terrorism (not to mention, say, fires), can anyone justify this?  We need new ambulances, Mayor Street tells us.  Excuse me?  Since when have Americans had to choose between one basic emergency response service and another?  If the city doesn't have money because the state doesn't have money, where is the federal government?  Where is the Department of Homeland Security?  Isn't it their job to make certain localities have the tools, equipment, and personnel needed to respond to an emergency?  There's a name for what's going on: the Bush tax-cuts.  George Bush gave the 300 billion dollar surplus he inherited from Clinton away in the form of tax-cuts to people who didn't need them--the kind who can buy their own personal fire engines, if you know what I mean.  Well, that's money that could have been used as federal aid to the states, to pay for all the stuff you and I rely on, like firefighters, or enjoy, like city pools, libraries, and affordable public transportation.

       Kerry and the Policy of Pre-emption   Correspondence with a Co-worker   Dear Abraham,  I wanted to say something about the AP article you forwarded:    urlLink Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry said he would be willing to launch a pre-emptive strike against terrorists if he had adequate intelligence of a threat.  This is actually the  opposite  of the Bush doctrine, which reserved the right to launch a pre-emptive strike against terrorists with no intelligence or proof of a threat whatsoever; and not simply a strike--a full-scale invasion and occupation.  And not against terrorists, either.  Apparently they were all in Iran.  Remember, the problem isn't the policy of pre-emption.  Pre-emption has a meaning roughly approximating what Kerry describes, as laid out by the UN Charter.  If someone is going to attack you, and you can prove it, then you can use force pre-emptively to stop the attack.  Of course, it doesn't say anything about taking over other countries.  It says you are permitted to use an amount of force proportional to the threat, etc.  And, as always, the burden of proof is on the people advocating use of force.  Anyway, what is wrongly being called Bush's "pre-emption" policy is not pre-emption at all but rather a doctrine of global dominance as laid out by the neo-cons in the National Security Strategy of 2002.  In effect, the US has the right to maintain global dominance by force against any threat, perceived, imagined, or otherwise, in order to destroy the challenge before it becomes reality.  That's not pre-emption.  That's unprovoked aggression, in the name of US interests.  Do neo-liberals tend towards militarism in solving world problems?  Yes.  But that doesn't make them the same as neo-conservatives, per se.  Yours,  Ryan

       The "Good" War   from  urlLink The Progressive      I was introduced as a veteran of the Army Air Corps, a bombardier who had flown combat missions over Europe in the last months of the war. I wasn't sure how this audience would react to what I had to say about the war, in that atmosphere of celebration, in the honoring of the dead, in the glow of a great victory accompanied by countless acts of military heroism.  This, roughly, is what I said: "I'm here to honor the two guys who were my closest buddies in the Air Corps--Joe Perry and Ed Plotkin, both of whom were killed in the last weeks of the war. And to honor all the others who died in that war. But I'm not here to honor war itself. I'm not here to honor the men in Washington who send the young to war. I'm certainly not here to honor those in authority who are now waging an immoral war in Iraq."  -  urlLink Howard Zinn

The ad ends with a succinct description of the Presidential contest: it's the corporations' choice versus the people's choice. When we tested the ad by running it in one city for a week, it produced an amazing 6% shift in the vote toward John Kerry.

       The Enlightenment Tradition   from  urlLink "Notes on Anarchism"    With the development of industrial capitalism, a new and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the Enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order. In fact, on the very same assumptions that led classical liberalism to oppose the intervention of the state in social life, capitalist social relations are also intolerable.   - Noam Chomsky  The idea here is that if you recognize government as a form of centralized authority, and you accept that centralized power is dangerous, then it stands to reason that you will view other forms of concentrated power as dangerous, also.  In other words, even someone like Adam Smith, who is credited as the founder of free-market capitalism, based his vision on a pre-industrial world: it presupposed a relative equality of property within the society, including productive property, meaning the resources and tools used to produce--land and livestock for farming, for example.  (Chomsky often notes that contemporary students of Smith never read the chapters in "Wealth of Nations" where Smith specifically warns against high concentrations of economic power.)  Modern-day conservatives, if they are honest, will acknowledge the danger of concentrated power in any form, since their (otherwise legitimate) critique of government is based on it.  So, ironically, conservatism is one of the best arguments against the type of system that Republicans currently represent.

From this comes a primary influence on the military budget, on foreign policy, military commitment and, ultimately, military action. War.

       Classical Liberalism   from  urlLink The eJournal Website    Q: Prof. Chomsky, you have said in the past that you respect "conservatism" and that there are many true "conservatives" who oppose what the Bush Administration is doing. I want to ask is there such a thing as classical conservatism and how different is that conservatism from the alleged conservatism practiced by the likes of Thatcher, Reagan, Bush 1, Brian Mulroney and Bush 2?  A: If by "conservatism" one means "classical liberalism" (a traditional conception), then, yes, I think there is much there that deserves respect.  Personally, I agree with Rudolf Rocker (and others) that classical liberal ideals were destroyed by capitalism, and that resurrecting them is a step towards advancing towards libertarian socialism (anarchism, in one sense of that term).  If by "conservatives" one means those who at least approach these ideals in some way--e.g., by opposing the resort to state violence in the interests of pathological creations of state power such as corporations--then, yes, I think there is a lot to respect in these circles as well.  But if by "conservative" one means radical statist reactionaries of the Reaganite-Thatcher-Bushite type, that's a wholly different matter. They simply defame the honorable term "conservative"--which is not to say that I would personally align myself with genuine conservatives, though (again speaking personally) I do respect them.

       The "New" Conservatives   from  urlLink What Conservatism Means     Particularly intriguing about Huntington's argument is that it perfectly predicted what was to happen in the 1960s. In that decade, there was a powerful upsurge of radicalism, associated initially with the Civil Rights movement and protest against the Vietnam War but quickly going beyond that to reject the whole fabric of American society. New Deal liberalism was denounced and rejected as Cold War liberalism or worse, and the radicals began their long march through our institutions.  It was in these circumstances that a group of liberal intellectuals, almost all of them members of the Democratic Party, many of them prominent members of the New York intellectual community, began to oppose the radical movement, to defend American institutions and values with classic conservative arguments. They were attacked from the left and derisively labeled neoconservatives. It was meant as an insult but readily accepted by Irving Kristol, the godfather of neoconservatism, and his colleagues.  They became an important force in American politics and have remained so. Many joined the Republican Party. They brought with them intellectual and polemical skills that had been in scarce supply on the Right, and by the 1980s they had seized the intellectual initiative from the Left.  Under the neoconservatives guidance, we now have a president committed not only to nation building in Iraq but also to region building throughout the Middle East. The belief that democratic institutions, behavior, and ways of thought can be exported and transplanted to societies that have no traditions of them is a profoundly unconservative, indeed a radical, belief. Conservatives traditionally have believed in the slow, organic growth of political institutions, not their imposition from without. Yet the most enthusiastic advocates of exporting democracy are American neoconservatives, which perhaps suggests that their break with their earlier modes of thought has been less than complete.

       The Hatriotism of Michael Moore       LEE WEBB: Our guest today says that director Michael Moore and others like him, actively promote an agenda he calls Hatriotism.

He is also the co-author of eight books about Islam, including the latest, Christian Jihad. Dr. Caner, welcome back to the program.  ERGUN CANER: Thank you, Lee.  WEBB: I am curious about -- Hatriotism. Tell us what it is, and tell us why you believe Michael Moore is the leading exponent of Hatriotism.  CANER: I think that what Michael Moore and others like him have done is to spit on the graves of my dead countrymen, who longed for the freedom that America has brought them. I think that Hatriotism is the new, modern, culturally relevant idea where it is popular to rouse up a crowd by making fun of America … or the administration, or the troops. The radicals are those who stand for the truth.

       The Sudan Crisis      What is happening in Sudan?  The Islamic Arab government of Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir is simultaneously trying to suppress two rebellions. One civil war, against black African rebels in the south, has been dragging on for 20 years; 2 million people have died in that conflict. In 2003, black Africans in the western region of Darfur also rose up against the government in Khartoum, the nation’s capital. El-Bashir responded with a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing. Sudan’s air force has repeatedly bombed the villages of Darfur, dropping crude bombs onto the straw-roofed huts. Then the Janjaweed—Arab militias mounted on camels and horses, armed with AK-47s and whips—sweep in to murder the men, rape the women, kidnap the children, and steal the cattle. More than 30,000 people have been slain, and 1 million have fled their homes. Most of the refugees are starving, and some are dying in the mine-strewn border region of neighboring Chad. One U.N. official has called the carnage “the world’s greatest humanitarian and human-rights catastrophe.”  -  urlLink The Week    Action : Tell Secretary of State Colin Powell and Congress to do something to  urlLink help .

       On Politics       I like discussions, and when I am asked questions, I try to answer them. It’s true that I don’t like to get involved in polemics. If I open a book and see that the author is accusing an adversary of “infantile leftism” I shut it again right away. That’s not my way of doing things; I don’t belong to the world of people who do things that way. I insist on this difference as something essential: a whole morality is at stake, the one that concerns the search for truth and the relation to the other.  -  urlLink Michel Foucault

       In America    urlLink     ...Internally, it’s a pretty free society. And there is a lot of protection of civil liberties that doesn’t come from the government; it comes from the population. There’s a deeply rooted tradition by now and they’re not going to give it up. Furthermore, civil liberties are protected by the rich and the powerful, because they benefit from them. They do not want the state to be powerful enough to carry out actions against citizens that could harm them. They want a compliant state, not a powerful state.  So a more developed form of state capitalism will tend to have civil libertarian protections. And they have these gains like freedom of speech, which is very well protected in the United States by comparative standards. That’s not a gift; it’s not in the Constitution; it’s not in the Bill of Rights, contrary to what they may teach you in school. Didn’t say anything about freedom of speech. Those were rights that were won by giving meaning to the First Amendment through struggle. In fact, it was pretty recent.  It wasn’t until the 1960s that the United States crossed the main barrier, which has not been passed by any other country to my knowledge, and eliminated--the Supreme Court eliminated--the rule of the law of seditious libel--the law that says that you can’t assault the state in words. Even if what you say is true, you can’t defame state authority, [that’s] seditious libel. As far as I know, every other country still has those restrictions, including England. But they were overcome finally in the United States in 1964, and that was in the course of the civil rights movement. It grew out of the civil rights protest. That’s the way these rights were established and pretty firmly rooted.  There is an attempt to undermine them, you’re right, but, frankly, I don’t think it’s going to get very far.  - Noam Chomsky, responding in a  urlLink Q&A session  in India

       The Role of Third-Parties in US History    urlLink     Third parties often focus on a single main issue and force it into the mainstream of American political life. It was third parties that first pressed for emancipation, female suffrage, prohibition, and an end to child labor. Socialist Eugene V. Debs lost both his 1912 and 1920 presidential runs, but much of his platform, like Social Security, ultimately formed the basis of the modern welfare state.  -  urlLink The Week

       Independence Day   This year I've resolved to feel good about the fourth of July.  There's no benefit to being the family crank at barbecues and weddings, after all.  Yesterday I even watched the FOX News channel, with its ubiquitous American flag graphics, and nonetheless felt right with the world.  Today, the vascular integrity of my brain thanked me.    For the engaged citizen, the United States can be a stroke-inducing affair, indeed.  But there's no reason to lose sensation or mobility in the left hemisphere of your body if you don't have to.  America was founded on the idea that concentrated power is dangerous and deserves to be challenged--overthrown, I think they said.  Any conservative worth his weight in ethnic-stereotypes will concede at least this much.  And that leaves all of us with a lot more to say to each other.   Last night I ate dinner with a libertarian I like to call my cousin.  One might not expect much to be shared between two family members, one who believes in expanding social programs and another who wants to dismantle them.  But while I don't know a lot about right-libertarianism beyond Ayn Rand and Adam Smith, I'm pretty sure they would both roll over in their respective graves if they saw the terrific sham masquerading as "free-trade" today:  socialized market protection for the wealthy and powerful (e.g. government bailouts), and market "discipline" for the poor (e.g. politically imposed third-world debt).  Honest conservatives understand this; at least, that's the theory Ralph Nader is banking his "I'll-draw-from-the-right, too" presidential campaign on:  classical liberals and conservatives have more in common with each other than they do with either wing of the American corporatist party, which advocates socialism for the privileged, owning classes, and "less government" for the rest of us.    The tradition of one person, one vote is much older than the tradition of one dollar, one vote.  The United States was founded on ideals that ordinary people, in pursuing their own mutual benefit, make real when their leaders don't--by challenging power and authority in the traditional, American way.

       Re: Comments   Recent strife in the "comments" portion of this blog has prompted me to make a general statement.  First, everyone is welcome to comment.      Second, I am not going to moderate any of it.  People are certainly free to say what they want, and no doubt they will--along with everything one might expect.  Thankfully, we're not responsible for what other people do, just how we carry ourselves in response.

       Richard Cohen, Abject Object of My Ire    urlLink     Dear Richard,  I watched the film last Sunday with my family and we left the theatre in tears.  Most of the other people I know who have seen the film also found it compelling, emotional, and posing important questions.  Apparently military and 9/11 families have endorsed the film and have asked the president to respond to the issues raised.  [LINK]  Re-reading your column, I'm struck by how forcefully you criticize the film without responding to it.  In fact, you don't say anything meaningful about the film at all; you simply reiterate how much you didn't like it, and then talk at length about anything else.  Assuming you did watch the film, perhaps I can remind you of its central themes: the potential conflict of interest between our heads of state and regimes that support terror; the erosion of our civil liberties under the Patriot Act; and the idea that while one class declares wars, another class fights them.  I think these are the things Americans are concerned about, thanks to this film.  Thanks,  Ryan

       National Jewish Group Applauds Presbyterian Church’s Historic Stand Against Israeli Occupation   from  urlLink Common Dreams :  Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), the largest grassroots Jewish peace group of its kind in the United States, applauds the Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) for its recent vote to explore divesting from companies who profit from the harming of "innocent people, Palestinian or Israeli." Far from being an attack on Jews, the PCUSA decision to investigate selective divestment as a way to end Israel’s 37-year occupation is in the best Judeo-Christian tradition of supporting universal human rights and justice.  This is definitely not something you see everyday.  For one thing, diverse Jewish perspectives are all but invisible in the US, having been supplanted by official Israeli positions at every turn.  Granted this is an organizational press release, not mainstream media coverage--which, incidentally, is already accusing Presbyterians of anti-semitism.    Juan Cole writes:  It really is worthwhile letting the Presbyterians know there is public support for the brave stance they have taken, since they will get enormous pressure to cave and shut up about what is being done to the Palestinian people, just as do almost all other American institutions and public individuals. The attempt to smear the church as racist for its stance, which is one of the most powerful and most effective (if completely despicable) techniques of the proponents of settler-colonialism in the Occupied Territories of Palestine, has already begun.  Call the church at 1-800-872-3283 or  urlLink email them  with your support.

       China Reacts to Homeland Security Beating   from  urlLink The World at a Glance , The Week Magazine:   China this week demanded that the U.S. conduct a high-level investigation into the beating of a Chinese tourist by a U.S. Homeland Security inspector. The tourist, businesswoman Zhao Yan, was visiting Niagara Falls when the American officer, Robert Rhodes, threw her against the wall of an inspection station, knocked her head on the floor, and beat her up. Rhodes said he mistakenly thought she was the companion of a man who had just been caught with marijuana. Pictures of a black and blue Zhao, her eyes swollen shut, dominated newspapers in her home province of Tianjin and prompted angry denunciations of the U.S. “I have been to many countries for business purposes,” Zhao told the Beijing China Daily, “and the United States is the most barbarous.” Rhodes has been charged with violating the woman’s civil rights.  This from  urlLink The Los Angeles Times :  Shopping at a Tianjin supermarket Wednesday, Zhang Weihao said women were not humiliated this way in China. "Women are supposed to be respected everywhere in the world," he said. "But apparently not in America."  Ouch.

He encouraged other independent filmmakers to join him in Florida.

       Muslim Allies   from  urlLink Informed Comment   The Muslim world was largely sympathetic to the US after the 9/11 attacks. Iranians held candlelight vigils, and governments and newspapers condemned terrorism. Bush's unprovoked attack on Iraq, however, turned people against the US. The brutal, selfish, exploitative occupation, the vicious siege of Fallujah, the tank battles in front of the shrine of Ali, a vicar of the Prophet, Abu Ghuraib, and other public relations disasters have done their work.

Now it's time for the home stretch--getting out each and every vote where it counts. MoveOn PAC is planning an incredibly ambitious, groundbreaking, precinct-level neighbor-to-neighbor campaign we're calling Leave No Voter Behind: MoveOn's Neighbor-to-Neighbor Victory Drive. We want to hire 500 organizers in the last weeks before the election to work in 10,000 key neighborhoods in battleground states to get 440,000 new votes for John Kerry to the polls.  If we can raise the first $1 million in the next 48 hours, we'll go for it.  You can sponsor a precinct in a battleground state for only $500 and make a huge difference in this election. But whether you can give $25 or $2,500, we're asking you to help launch this program today.

       Interview with Norman Mailer   from  urlLink New York Magazine   I’ve been saying for a couple of years that Bush is not a conservative. He’s what I call a flag conservative, a Flag-Con. He’s not as interested in conservative values as in empire-building. The classic conservative, someone like Pat Buchanan or, to a more complicated degree, Bill Buckley, does believe that certain values in society must be maintained. The classic conservative believes in stability. You make changes grudgingly and with a great deal of prudence. Don’t move too quickly, is the rule of thumb, because society, as they see it, is essentially a set of compromises and imbalances that can be kept going only by wisdom and, to use the word again, prudence. So you don’t go off in wild, brand-new directions. None of this characterizes Bush. As a Flag-Con, he is surrounded by the tycoons of the oil industry, plus neoconservatives, plus gung-ho militarists who believe that since we’ve created the greatest fighting machine in the history of the world, it’s a real shame not to use it.  - Norman Mailer
