       urlLink US forces  use of depleted uranium weapons is 'illegal'   
By Neil Mackay      Sunday Herald  


BRITISH and American coalition forces are using depleted uranium (DU) shells in the war against Iraq and deliberately flouting a United Nations resolution which classifies the munitions as illegal weapons of mass destruction.  

 urlLink Gary Hart's  words may haunt us - again   By Diane Carman    
Denver Post Columnist  
Sunday, March 30, 2003 - We all know what happened in 2001 when we ignored warnings from Gary Hart....It was only after 9/11 that their proposals, including establishing a department of homeland security, were taken seriously....."Now, when the generals are saying they're facing an enemy they didn't expect..." Hart paused. "That's what I was trying to warn them about two years ago."

      My son had to write a letter to pResident Bush about Iraq for his senior gov't class.  They were given 20 words - 10 of which had to be used in a letter at least 200 words long.  He is swamped with his senior courses and work so I GLADLY volunteered to write his letter for him.  I will post it as follows:  March 31, 2003
President George W. Bush
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500

Dear Mr. Bush:
The war on Iraq does not make sense to me. The connection your administration has made between Iraq and al-Qaida seems contrived. It is hard to believe that smart people would start a war based on such flimsy evidence. However, now that the war is in full swing, the missing pieces have finally begun to fall into place. It would appear that this is not really about Iraq. It is not about weapons of mass destruction, or terrorism, or Saddam Hussein. 

This war seems intended to mark the emergence of the United States as a global empire, seizing sole responsibility as planetary policeman. It is a plan by those who believe the United States must seize global domination, even if it means becoming the "imperialists" the Muslim world always claimed we were. 

Sept. 11 has given advocates of empire building a new opportunity to press their case with you and Prime Minister Tony Blair. So in questioning our role in Iraq, we are really questioning the role that the United States will play in the years and decades to come.  

The current regime in Baghdad has been provoked by our attack and acts of "imperialism".  The Iraqis have indeed decided to fight for their country - something we didn't expect.  This has brought on the bloody and deadly conflicts we have seen in Kuwait, Basra and An Nasiriyah when the Fedayeen and Republican Guard fight for their homeland.  It is also the reason we have seen our soldiers - such as Lori Piestewa - being taken prisoner.   That's one small fact they omit at the Centcom briefings from Qatar.

On 3/27/03, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld brushed aside the suggestion of imperialism, noting that the United States does not covet other nations' territory. That may be true, but 57 years after World War II we still have major bases in Germany and Japan.  This would explain why Germany, France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have expressed resistance of to join our "coalition".   Rumsfeld, Gen. Richard Myers and Secretary of State Colin Powell all express the belief that a successful war against Iraq will produce other benefits, serving a lesson for nations such as Iran, Syria, Jordan and North Korea.  I do not agree.  

The administration seems unconcerned about an exit strategy from Iraq once Saddam is toppled.  The cost of this commitment will be enormous. In 2000, we spent $281 billion on our military, more than the next 11 nations combined. By 2003, our expenditures will have risen to $378 billion. The price of maintaining an empire is always high.   

I feel that peace is best achieved by seeking alliances and international consensus - such as UN Chairman Kofie Annan has expressed.  Why is it necessary to take a more unilateral approach, accepting the global dominance that you feel history has thrust upon us?  
I feel we should make these important decisions as a democracy.  I, for one, pray for peace.
Sincerely,
Bryce

 Marching on Bablyon: Are Bush and the Religious Right Forcing the World to Act Out their Religious Fantasies?   
"Bush's obsession with attacking Iraq has been attributed to oil, to family vendetta due to his father's confrontation with Saddam, and with over-zealous terrorist-fighting efforts. However, what really lies beneath this obsession is a religious delusion, one shared, alas by many of his government appointees, including John Ashcroft, a devout Pentecostal. Bush, like Ashcroft, believes (and in fact is trying to insure) that the world is in the "end times" called for by the biblical book of Revelation - at least as interpreted by the doomsdayers, who are generally barely functional clinically classical paranoid schizophrenics..."  

A friend sent me the link to this website.  I was intrigued having been a reggae fan for years and full aware of the references to "Babylon" in Rastafarianism in addition to the regional and Biblical implications of the term.  However, when I started reading this article it scared the daylights out of me.

"On Monday, U.S. Army Gen. Tommy Franks was asked at a press conference why there were not civilian uprisings or more public expressions of pro-American sentiment in Iraq. "Fear," he answered. And I'd guess he's correct. The general said that citizens in Iraq are afraid to speak out because they will be attacked by loyalists to Saddam. He said that they have been frightened and intimidated into silence. So, who wins our war with Iraq if citizens here feel the same apprehension?"

 urlLink For Those Who Oppose War, What Now?  by Peter J. Gomes  
"By what logic, moral or otherwise, however, is a war that millions thought to be unjustified and immoral even before it occurred now made justified and moral by the fact that it is occurring? Does the fact of a conflict-in-progress nullify all questions about the legitimacy of that conflict? Are those who opposed the orchestrated drumbeat to war, and who remain unpersuaded by Bush's repeated and changing rationales for his war, now simply to acquiesce in devout silence to the course of international violence from which he has refused to be deterred? Are we to ignore our own consciences because he has determined to ignore our protests?"

      Back to work today.  It sucked.  Hard to get back into the swing of it all after a beautiful 4 day weekend.  Lots of whiners, complainers and inquisitors calling the Help Desk for assistance/reassurance.  It was tiring and am now home fighting a bad headache.  Still have to pick up the daughter from dance (what else is new) and slap something together for dinner.  I am thinking chili dogs.  

Bought a  urlLink "Front Page for Dummies"  book yesterday.  Hope it helps my addled brain with my ongoing webpage hijinx.  It can't hurt!

Sick of "the War".  I think I am "shocked and awed" enough.  Really.  Knew it was inevitable but don't like to see our  urlLink soldiers  being captured.  Still don't understand why this conflict had to be upon us forced as it is.  Don't like the stories coming out of Bush having some sort of hate on for Iraq and him saying  urlLink '" F___ Saddam.  We're taking him out.'   Those were the words of President George W. Bush, who had poked his head into the office of National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. It was March 2002, and Rice was meeting with three U.S. Senators, discussing how to deal with Iraq through the United Nations, or perhaps in a coalition with America's Middle East allies. Bush wasn't interested."  Sounds like he has some  urlLink personal  issues to deal with.

  NOW  I have a serious headache.  I am outta' here.

      Well, the weekend is almost over.  It was nice to have the Spring Break.  

I didn't get a lot done on Thursday - paperwork and more paperwork.  Getting the financial aid forms filled out for my son and getting him applied to some community colleges here.  Not sure if he will be applying to any universities or not.  He needs to figure it out as graduation day is creeping up on us like a bad pair of Hanes.

Friday started out with the daughter and I making a Walgreen's run.  Get the month's prescriptions in one fell swoop and other cosmetic/health/beauty items that might pique our interest.  She talked me into getting some hair color which has one color then you put highlights over it.  We theorized that it would blend the gray in better and I can just let it go from there.  We bought it - against my better judgement.  We got home right as the tv was showing us our "Shock and Awe".  We had been laughing about the media being all butthurt over not seeing it as promised so when the said it was going to happen we were acting silly.  Got the son up for it and were joking a bit until the bombs started falling.  Then the 3 of us became silent and watched the 10 minute barrage.  It was indeed shocking and awesome.  Awful even.  When it was over my son turned to me and said "there were people there".  I nodded - not knowing what else to say to him.  My daughter was visibly shaken like I hadn't seen her since 9/11.  There was a rawness of emotions that was hard to put a finger on.  

My daughter then wanted to do some "bonding" so we colored my hair.  Turned out too red for my liking but she swears it looks "totally cool".  Of course we must remember she is 14 and was a bit shell-shocked.  I think she liked being with Mom more than how my hair turned out.  And that's totally ok - I feel the same way.  After watching bombs drop in Baghdad the only thing I wanted to do was be with my family.

After that she leaves for the mall with friends and ends up spending the night elsewhere - as teenage girls are wont to do.  My son worked and then took his girlfriend out afterwards as teenage boys are wont to do.  I spent the afternoon and evening cleaning my house.  I figured it was therapy.  Seemed like the natural thing to do.  They may be in rubble in Iraq but my house would be clean by golly.  I tuned out the news and the carnage I had seen earlier and had been glued to for so long and just did what I needed to do.  I worked  my troubles out with Lysol.  The house was pristine when my husband came home from work.  

 Now, I Am the Terrorist   
We watched the news replay of the bombings.  He was able to verbalize what the kids and I had been feeling and I couldn't put my finger on.   He said "wasn't it just a little too 9/11?".  OMG - that's when it hit me. We had seen and felt the same thing ourselves, we Americans, on September 11 and we know how lousy that feels.  This was no different except they KNOW who did it.  ,  urlLink William Rivers Pitt  wrote it well saying "The city of Baghdad, founded in 762 A.D. under the name Madinat as-Salam – 'City of Peace' – is this day a lake of fire. The opening stage of the Bush administration's "Shock and Awe" attack plan began as night fell on Iraq, and lived terribly up to its terrible name. On September 11th, I sat in numb horror as the images of carnage unfolded before me on the television. On that day, I was the victim of terrorism, along with every other American. Today, I sit in numbed horror as more carnage unfolds. Hundreds of massive missiles have rained down on a city far away, killing indiscriminately among the young, the infirm, the old and the innocent. My government did this. My nation did this. My leaders did this. Today, I am the terrorist. We are the terrorists now, stupid underinformed terrorists who dance to the tune of a corporate media machine that will profit wildly from this attack. NBC, MSNBC and CNBC are owned by General Electric, one of the largest defense contractors on earth. We will continue to do so, and you can watch it from your couch"  The husband and I heatedly discussed this whole war and how it is graphic and amazing - awesome even - it just feels wrong.  Feels dirty and cheap and vengeful and wrong.  Jimmy Breslin writes that it's  urlLink Exhibition Not A War , "I wonder if anybody watching this Shock and Awe bombing Friday noted that Iraq didn't have a plane. There is no joy to kill the bull unless he fights. You can't call this a war. The television people, and the politicians in Washington, said this was an extraordinary exhibition of bombing that never has been seen before. They used the right word, exhibition. It's an exhibition war, not a real war. You'll take it right now, if it keeps these young men of ours alive. Take it and gag on it, for this is a total character collapse of a country that was supposed to be so far above this loathsome act. You become the thing you hate. And Friday, we did. We became the Germany of 1939."   When Clinton led America into war (with no casualties) the GOP refused to back him, saying "We support the troops but not this president." Now that the situation is reversed, the Democrats are elbowing each other out of the way to see which senator can give Bush all the support in the world.  Surreal stuff. 

In the meantime,  urlLink Thousands March in Manhattan Against War .  Many handmade signs referred to the bomb barrage on Baghdad on Friday, like the one that read ``New Yorkers remember our own shock and awe.'' Sarita Martinez, 23, who carried a homemade sign reading ``Couch Potatoes 4 Peace'' (one spud was reading a soap-opera magazine)Why was she protesting against the war in Iraq? ``My best friend is there,'' she said, clutching a dog tag. ``This is for him.'' 

Since there were no protests that were advertised here in Phoenix I did my part by planting flowers.  I spent all day Saturday ripping weeds out of the garden out front and planting tons of new flowers.  I have snapdragons, petunias, pansies, lantana, daisies, marigolds and assorted other ground covers to make my little entryway look like it belongs in freakin' Disneyland.  Felt good to give some beauty back to the earth after the war - even if it is a world away.     Using the phrase "shock and awe" is a grubby effort to find a slogan. Why try? "Blitzkrieg" is part of the world language and can't be replaced.

        SHOCK AND AWWWWWW   
With the news media poised  urlLink President Bush  announced the attack in a four-minute television speech to the nation. "On my order, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war," he said. "These are the opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign." Minutes before the speech, an internal television monitor showed the president  pumping his fist. "Feels good," he said.   With the promise of a primetime war and fireworks aptly named "shock and awe" the media outlets were ready with roofcams, gas masks, Iraqi weathercasts.  It was obvious they were ready to rumble.  However, it was to be a dissappointment for the networks.  It was no where near the display of force shown in 1991 or that was promised to them prior to the war.  By midnight it was obvious that the visuals were not going to what they wanted.  The media threw a collective temper tantrum, uttering "shock and awe, shock and awe" and immediately grilled officials when it would be clear that the "shock and awe" phase of the U.S. strike against Iraq had begun, Pentagon officials said it would be unmistakable. "You'll know it when you see it," a  urlLink Pentagon official  said. " With more than  urlLink 600 journalists  "embedded" with military units in the desert and field trips offered every day for "unilateral" journalists a lot of canned journalism has been occurring in Kuwait. Reporting for ABCNEWS,  urlLink Mike Cerre , who is traveling as an embedded journalist with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, confirmed his unit had crossed into southern Iraq. It was not immediately clear what their mission was.  Maybe nobody's running the show; early indicators are that Iraqi leadership is already collapsing. Or maybe this is devilishly clever. Pilots using satellite-guided smart bombs don't care if a city is lighted or dark; this matters not to cruise missiles, either.   

In a story on the bottom of the tv screen today; an  urlLink Arizona  nuclear plant reportedly received specific threat.   "I've been telling Arizonans, every group I talk to: Keep doing what you're doing. Go to work, go to school, go to play golf, spend money, spend more money, go shopping," Gov. Janet Napolitano said in remarks that drew applause and laughter.  However, this news sent my daughter into a frenzy wanting to panic shop at Fry's and prepare the bathroom for the long term.  I finally got her settled down and told her that we would be fine.  I couldn't honestly tell her that I was afraid as well but the thought of making the bathroom a bunker for her, her brother, her father, myself and the 2 dogs scared me even more.

           Ok, so the son didn't check in yesterday.  He's 17 and a senior in high school.  This is his Spring Break.  He's got senioritis pretty darn bad I must admit.  The problem for him is he's working this week too.  He works nights running lights at  Phoenix Theatre. He's a great kid - very responsible for his age.  Well, yesterday he had the whole day off so when I was home for lunch he and his girlfriend and buddies were heading out - probably to "the lake".  Ok, the only close lake here in Phoenix is Lake Pleasant and it was a really lousy day for a visit there but I didn't go into that then.  Not worth the argument.  Told him to check in though.  Get home from work and there's no word from him.  Even his sister hadn't heard from him.  I leave a couple messages on his cell phone to  PLEASE  check in.  Nothing.  Nada.  I mean, I never had the luxury of a cell phone as a teen but by golly I found the nearest pay phone if necessary to check in on. But no, not my lummox - he blows me off. I am getting ready for bed at 9 (ok, ok - I am a geezer and go to bed early - sue me) and I leave a final message for him.  I laid the guilt on thick - even the husband and daughter said so.  Told him how it "hurt my feelings" that he hadn't called me back.  LOL  Never heard back from though.  He was snoring away on my sofa this morning when I got up so I made  ALL SORTS OF NOISE . I ran the disposal, boiled water in the whistling teakettle, turned the news on the tv and played music on the computer.  He didn't move a muscle.  Didn't even bat an eye.  He's out cold.  It just proves the young man is impervious to guilt  and  loud noises.  Ahhhh, those teen years..... 

My 14 year-old daughter likes that new young Grammy award winning singer John Mayer.  I do too.  It's one of the few things we seem to agree on these days.  She's thinks he's great.  I think he's great and when I read this  urlLink article  I decided I like him even more.  For a 25 year-old he writes some very worldly and poetic songs and seems wise beyond his years.  I think he's worth a listen if you hadn't already.


Wore the tee shirt I had made today.  It's an iron-on transfer of the  urlLink  Patriots for Peace  poster which can be downloaded.  I chose the one for Arizona and printed it up on an iron-on transfer and slapped it on a $2 Walgreen's white tee shirt.  I made it over the weekend but wanted to wear it today on this eve of war.  I stopped at the store to get  urlLink Krispy Kreme  donuts to bring to work and you wouldn't BELIEVE the dirty looks I got from customers and employees alike.  I mean, I am not that threatening otherwise.  Why would a red/white/blue tee shirt reading "Arizona Patriots for Peace" intimidate them so much?   Just a simple white cotton tee shirt with a peaceful message.  No big whoop.  Makes me wonder about the fate of desention and debate in America.  However, it made me feel better to read the following:

"Those Americans who opposed our going to war with Iraq, who wanted the United Nations to remove those weapons without war, need not apologize for giving voice to their conscience, last year, this year or next year. In a country devoted to the freedom of debate and dissent, it is every citizen's patriotic duty to speak out, even as we wish our troops well and pray for their safe return."  urlLink Howard Dean   

 NOTE TO THE AGE IMPAIRED :  It was when Walter Cronkite started to question the Vietnam war from his platform on the CBS Evening News that middle American also turned against the war.  The "most trusted man in America," retired CBS Evening News anchor  urlLink Walter Cronkite  put aside his journalistic impartiality Tuesday night and issued a blistering dissent to President Bush's decision to wage war with Iraq. At a Drew University forum, Cronkite said he feared the war would not go smoothly, ripped the "arrogance" of Bush and his administration and wondered whether the new U.S. doctrine of "pre-emptive war" might lead to unintended, dire consequences.

 urlLink Benson's  editorial cartoon today.  In addition there's a little graphic page  urlLink here  for your enjoyment.  They may be irreverant but I think that's pretty healthy.  With all the events going on today you need to keep your sense of humor for sure.  Otherwise you will go crazy.  The folks over at the The Onion are always willing to give you a good laugh and make you forget the madness around you.  This  urlLink Onion  article is pretty funny.  I   love   good satire.  However, sometimes the truth is stranger (and funnier) than fiction.  This article about a  urlLink tractor  standoff complicating life in the nation's capital is proof of that.

      After the pResident's speech last night I got tired of the cable news networks and their constant SCREAMING about this war and the tactical implications, the talking heads, the spin doctors, the pollsters and who ever else they could drag off the street to give an opinion - no matter how ridiculous.  I was adequately medicated and decided I needed a kinder, gentler form of information.  I then switched to PBS (here in Phoenix Channel 8) and watched the excellent Frontline program  urlLink The Long Road to War  which explained the history of our dealings with Iraq and how  urlLink Wolfowitz's  theory of "preemption" creeped it's way into our administration.  Very informative for sure and I would highly recommend seeing if your area is showing it again.  Following that was Bill Moyers  urlLink Now  which was quietly informative on how things were progressing with our new ultimatum to Saddam.  Bill Moyers rocks.  It was a pleasant break from the blathering of the cable news channels.  Our local coverage was just sad as you could sense that they felt out of the loop.  Unable to scramble some team coverage using Chopper 12 and putting reporters out in the middle of no where to give us stories that relate to NOTHING.  It's a little weird here in Arizona with this war on - the majority of people here consider themselves "Goldwater Conservatives".  I just wish they would remember the quote from Barry: 

 "A government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take everything you have." 
- Barry Goldwater - 

However, poeople don't seem to think that this government is lying to us or too big and powerful considering what happened on 9/11.  This is too bad because we are letting a national case of the jitters make us believe the lies.  urlLink Lies, Damned Lies, and Ultimatums(3/17/03)  is a great breakdown of the speech.  It kind of makes my little tally look - well, feeble.  

In the meantime the folks at GlobalSecurity.org have this great  urlLink  Iraq Countdown Clock  going.   MSNBC has the countdown clock in the lower part of the tv screen too.  At lunchtime it was screaming "30:00:46" or something like that.  I didn't have the heart to see if CNN and FOX had them too.   urlLink Benson  has a really good 'toon on the subject of countdowns as well

       Events in Iraq - Final Days of Decision 
The speech lasted about 10 minutes - tops.  The tally is as follows:

pResident Bush mentioned:

Terra/Terraists - 9 times

Disarm/Disarmament - 8 times

UN Security Council/ UN - 8 times

WMD - 6 times

New/Free Iraq - 5 times

Torture/Using Gas on their own people - 4 times

Regime Change - 4 times

Coalition - 3 times

Peace/Peacefully - 3 times

Al-Queda - 1 time

France - 1 time

Resolution 1441 - 1 time

12 years - 1 time

Nuk-u-lar - 1 time

"Horra" - 1 time and perhaps my favorite 

favorite soundbites:

"Iraq is a recklessly aggressive country"

"US is exercising it's sovereign authority"

"it's not a question of authority but of will"

Saddam has 48 hours or "we will attack at a time of our choosing"

I went outside for a cigarette after the speech and here on the streets of Phoenix you can hear cheering and honking of car horns.  Made me think of something Bush said during the speech - "we are a PEACEFUL people".  

This is surreal.  Wrong, totally wrong.

Another 48 hours.....!) and they have the global equivalent of TEAM COVERAGE all over the place at worthless bunkers and ptaches of kitty litter in Kuwait.  The drumbeats are getting louder and louder.  I have my legal pad and I'm ready to tally, take notes and take names.

      Still battling the battle of Front Page. Got out the manuals from the class I took on it and I still can't get my daughter's web page to publish. Giving me fits.  I need to settle down, ignore myself and just stop obsessing - but it's hard for me to do that.  

On another note - the pResident has declared "diplomacy over" and called the UN officials out of Iraq today.  Well, I knew it would happen by St. Patrick's Day and predicted that weeks ago.  Hate it when I am right like this.  Bush will speak tonight.  Hot dog - I will be firing up the tv for that one.  Get a beer, get some pretzels (unlike Shrub I don't choke on 'em) and my trusty legal pad and paper.  I will be posting the tally of "sound bites" in tomorrows post.  Let's hope he's at least unmedicated for this press address - that last one made him look like he was on Valium.  It was scary.  

It's truly sad that it's all come down to this - a war for oil.  We, as a nation, have not attacked another soveriegn nation unless attacked since the Mexican/America skirmish.  Now we are doing it up "big time" so we can get our hands on the oil and settle a few scores.  A sad day for America for sure.

      I am in web page hell  !!!!  Heaven help me - it's a dark and lonely place.  My first attempt w/ Front Page - the Farlow Family Homepage - worked great.  Not a problem.  Able to edit it, add to it and the whole nine yards.  However, try to make a separate page for the husband and the daughter and get blanks.   Unreal.  I am following the same stinkin' procedures I used on the first one.  I cannot for the life me figure out what I am doing wrong.

However, I have pissed away and ENTIRE day doing this and have nothing but a dirty house to show for it.  

I am a loathsome individual.

The schools and the personnel there have all hit the road starting their Spring Break.  It's times like these that make me miss working 10½ months.

      Well, up early this morning.  I went to bed early after taking my daughter to dance classes for 3 hours.  I don't know where she gets the energy.  I also ran to the grocery store as we were out of toilet paper and Snausages.  That's a dangerous combo to be out of in this house.  I also came home and worked on the web page which is still giving me fits.  I swear, if brains were money I would need a loan to buy a cup of coffee.


Now some random thoughts.  I am sure glad that Elizabeth Smart was found safe and sound and is home with her family.  I welcome the change in the news from the "Showdown with Saddam" crap; but I feel so badly for the Smart family.  I think they need the time to heal.  I think the following article pretty much sums up how I feel about that.

      ai caramba!  I go to one of my favorite liberal websites - Bartcop - and it's got a prompt on there that "the website you are trying to access has been restrained".  Does this mean that the Ashcroft goons have gotten to our beloved Bart?  Please, say it isn't so.  If anyone knows anything about this then please let me know. ( houndog2@cox.net is my e-mail address.)  

In these times we need our big hammer and Bartcop was one of the few who was willing to weild it.  go to www.bartcop.com and see for yourselves.  In the meantime we have some other sites to access - thankfully.  I will post those sites here soon.

      My son got a call on his cell phone - my hounds are on the lam and are in someone's back yard chasing their chickens.  I should be having a FINE lunch break today!!!

Ok - back from basset wrangling.....geez what a seance!!! I get there and Dixie is going wild and there is a security breach in the fence and the beeeeeeee-otch left a nasty message on my answering machine that they were "viscious" (yeah - towards poultry!) and she had called animal control.  I left several messages for the wench on her machine which had one of those annoying messages done by the rugrat - UGH!    Sooooooooooooo,  so after leaving several messages with no response I do a reverse phone number look up on the computer and find out she's just around the corner.  I go down to liberate Beau the Mighty Chicken Hunter and there he is on 2 ft. of rope tied - IN THE SUN WITH NO WATER - to the tree and there's a letter to animal control to take the dog and he had only biten chickens not humans.  (Damn I hope he got himself one).  I pull a bodacious U-turn in the road and drive through her grass (where are flowers when you want them eh?) and get out and get Beauregard and yank the letter down.  Her cell phone number was on there so I call her and she begins to tell me how it's wrong to have the hole in the fence (we didn't intend for it to be there - DUH) and that Beau was poultry obsessed and Dixie had come home during the melee.  I mean she made it seem like my hounds are freakin' terrorists or something. Like they are the Bin Laden Bassets or some sort of Axis of Evil Hounds (thanks to Christian for that line) She is the sister of Pastor Billy who lives next door and drove by and let the Dixie Chicken in the back yard and noticed a big hole in the fence so she called the pound on my hound!!!  Get REAL!!!.  Now, my question is how did the dog get in their backyard with the block fence if the freakin' gate wasn't open?  And why couldn't she have brought Beauregard home - HUH?  Also - real nice compassion towards the animal and the familywho owns it by this "Christian" holier-than-thou housewife.  Damn it make me glad I am a pagan.  But I digress - the hounds are home and locked in the house.  I just hope I don't go home to carnage or hound puke with feathers in it.

        SMALL SCREEN OBSERVATIONS   
 urlLink 24  rocked - as ALWAYS - last night.  It was an action and conspiracy-packed episode with only a couple of Kim Bauer sightings.  They are pulling out all the stops for these final 4 (3 now) episodes.  Just when you think the show has  urlLink jumped the shark  it does something that totally makes the shark it's BITCH.  I love that show.  
 urlLink American Idol  was like a train wreck - as always - but somehow I have to watch because I have no life.  They actually had each of those kids sing a freakin' Neil Sedaka song - TWICE.  OMG it was sad.  However, upon watching it I have to say that Josh the Marine must go.  
Over on  urlLink IFC  they are playing an equisite documentary -  urlLink Buena Vista Social Club  which documents Ry Cooder's trip to Cuba recording Cuban music.  It's a fabulous film and makes me want to go to Cuba, drink strong coffee and daquiris and live my vicarious Hemingway fixation.

        PERSONAL MUSINGS   
 Fasting   
Since I have decided to fast I am utilizing the  urlLink Hollywood Miracle Diet .  It's not bad and it does help stave off the hunger.  The only problem with it is that you pee like a racehorse.  I guess that's a good thing since this supposed to cleanse out the toxins in the body.  Hope that includes my mother-in-law's caustic aura overload from Sunday.  They do tell you to not to drink coffee or smoke while you are doing to which I say - AS IF!!!  I can do without food but not the caffiene/nicotine combo. That's just wrong.  
My hair looks like dookie today - thought I would share.  Somehow the natural curls have decided to assume a life of their own - as they are inclined to do.  Usually I can deal with it and with enough hair spray or mouse (and squirrel LOL) can get it do what I want.  Not today.  How can I be expected to manage my life when I can't even control my hair?  
  PARENTAL RAVES   
There was a rumble at Butler Park on my way home from work yesterday.  Twenty-some-odd barechested teenagers having themselves a fight.  I got home and called 911 and the daughter heard me reporting the fray.  Then she heads out to a friend's house and calls me to inform me they are "going to Butler Park".  Well of course they were - can't miss out on a good mini-drama.  I knew that since that was an hour after the rumble they would be safe and didn't let it get to me.  
The son comes home - his car is in big trouble (what else is new eh?) and needs a new wheel bearing.  I drive him around while we get him shoes, his final paycheck from the theatre and to go order a corsage for his prom date.  We had a great time and he told me he was out of the doldrums now that he had new shoes.  Then he gave me grief for having rush-hour driving angst and on the way home the daughter called to check and see if I was with him or not - panicked that I wasn't at home - heaven forbid!  He then started teasing her saying "oh no - did we leave the back gate open again?".  Too funny.  The man-child is trying so hard to make his way and admits he's confused.  In the meantime he was a joy to be with and we had some great "one-on-one" time together.  
  POLITICAL RANTS   
  urlLink Back to the Future    
George W. Bush represents the third and most powerful wave in the right's long-running attack on the governing order created by twentieth-century liberalism. The movement's ambition is to roll back the twentieth century. For the first time since the 1920s, Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court are all singing from same hymnal and reinforcing one another.  The hard-right conservatives are overjoyed when the Supreme Court and Bush's Justice Department chip away at our civil liberties. We must ask ourselves - is this the country we want for our grandchildren or great-grandchildren?  When the Democrats find ideas and remedies that match the real experiences of Americans, then they will have their vision, and perhaps the true answer to the right wing.

 urlLink Democrat Howard Dean  is on fire!!!!    He ignited the California Democratic Convention when he pounded his fist on the podium and declared "I want my country back!".  Yes sir! He then went further on  urlLink Sunday  stating "George W. Bush ran for President on the promise that he would be ``a uniter, not a divider.'' Nothing could be further from the truth......The issue is whether we, as Americans, will continue to allow ourselves to be led down a path by this Administration to a country that is divided against itself by race, income, gender, sexual orientation and religion.......I believe equal rights can be achieved, but it will only be achieved when we have leaders in the highest offices of the land who stop pandering to bigots in exchange for a handful of votes. "  While he's stating the truth, the Kerry campaign launched a sleazy attack against Dean.  The attack started over Dean's comments in an article posted Monday on Time.com. "We have to take a different approach" to diplomacy, the former Vermont governor was quoted as saying during a campaign stop in New Hampshire . "We won't always have the strongest military."
Kerry spokesman Chris Lehane issued a statement expressing incredulity over Dean's remarks and saying that Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, would "guarantee that America has the strongest, best trained, most well-equipped military in history."  "Howard Dean's stated belief that the United States won't always have the strongest military raises serious questions about his capacity to serve as commander in chief," Lehane said. "No serious candidate for the presidency has ever before suggested that he would compromise or tolerate an erosion of America's military supremacy."   
Give me a break - Dean's point is well taken by anyone who isn't attempting to score cheap political points. Dean was referring to how strong alliances are more important than ever because they're going to be all we have if George W. Bush continues to drive the US economy into the ground and there is no one left with a job to pay for national defense.Dean was simply making an argument that history suggests is almost 100% certain to be correct: that the US won't always have the strongest military. While Howard Dean probably should have said we "might" not always have the strongest military, stating it as a certainty is probably safe, given that the United States of America is unlikely to still be in existence, much less have the strongest military by the time the sun burns out. But Such a statement in no way suggest the military we have will be weakened any time soon, or by anything a President Howard Dean would do.

  Everything new is old - again   
The rape of  urlLink Iraq  (or as future historians will doubtless call it, "The Dawn of the Shiite Empire") was planned openly several years ago by a hard-right neo-con cell led by Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld. Now it turns out that the recent saber rattling aimed at Syria -- threats of sanctions, "surgical" strikes, and "regime change" -- was also carefully planned, by the same people, long before the Bush Regime seized power.  Many of the same people who led the campaign for war against Iraq signed a report released three years ago that called for using military force to disarm  urlLink Syria  of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and to end its military presence in Lebanon.   In the meantime,  some things don't spin very well.  urlLink Exhibit A  would be Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld railing at the "media" when they ask about the elusive weapons. Before the war, the administration yammered on that Iraq had hundreds of tons of chemical weapons and thousands of gallons of biological weapons. Now Rumsfeld says we must be patient, that finding easily concealed weapons takes time.  Give me a break.  To prove that it's all about the oil we have Bush giving in to Bin Laden's terms and moving  air command posts from  urlLink Saudi Arabia  to Qatar.  what is this? Bush negotiating with terrorists? Say it isn't so!!! What happened to "Dead or Alive"? It's been  urlLink 589  days since Bush promised we'd find Bin Laden and now he's giving in to his demands.  There's a classic example of ADD - or is it just the smell of Iraqi oil that gave him amnesia?  
  PARENTAL RANTS   

The boy was a joy yesterday.  Came home in a good mood, upbeat and just a general pleasure to be with.  I had bought him a card at  urlLink Wag's  and he found it and came and hugged me heartily.  He then said to me "Mom, don't worry - I am a teen and teens act this way".  I swear that the boy has a serious case of  urlLink Peter Pan Syndrome .  Every new gray hair on my head has his name on it.    

  WORK RANTS   
Between the parental advice from those without children, the ditto-monkey rantings of pro-Bush "booo-rah's" and the a/c cranked down to 68° I am close to the edge here.  I would like to turn the air off and tell them all to stay the hell out of my body-bag.  

  PERSONAL GOALS   
Until I can get my personal life and my nervous system in line thus preventing me from upchucking anything I eat I have decided NOT TO EAT.  I am further vindicated in this decision to learn that  urlLink fasting  may improve health.

        PARENTAL LAMENTS   
My son is extremely depressed.  The pressures of high school graduation, college selection, quitting his job and being in love have caught up with him.  He is high as a kite one minute then the next minutes he's unable to function or get out of bed.  We are at a loss as to what to do.  It makes me feel totally inadequate as a parent and of course I blame myself.  I have the panic disorder and have to be on meds for that and the depression thing/panic thing runs in the family.  It's my fault that he got it.  His girlfriend talked to the husband and me last night urging us to get him help and to keep pushing him to get help and make some life decisions.  She is working on him too.  She's a good girl with a good head on her shoulders.  She is also head over heels in love with him.  I explained that the harder I push the more he gets angry that I am managing his life.  If I don't push him then I am blamed for not helping. Totally at a loss.  I bring up counseling and he's freaked out that they will put him on meds.  Won't take 'em and is afraid of not "being himself" anymore.  No amount of explaining the chemical implications of depression work on him.  I have never seen him like this and am worried sick over him.  I want to help but no amount of nagging on my part will help until HE decides he needs help.  I am between a rock and a hard place here.  
Getting parenting advice from co-workers without children of their own is bugging me - how the hell would they know what it's like?  It's easy to dispense the "armchair psychology" when they aren't living it.  The worst part of it all is it's completely unsolicited advice.

        SUNDAY EARLY MORNING   
Well, survived the birthday party.  They ate 3 huge Costco pizzas, drank all flavored beverages in the house and swam like fools in the freezing water then would get in the jacuzzi.  The boys went home around 9 and there are now 9 teenage girls stroked out on air mattresses in my living room.  To quote the Beatles - "a splendid time was had by all".  
Up listening to the gospel show on  urlLink WWOZ  from New Orleans and chatting with my sister in Austin.  I have to have the headphones on which really cramps my style. I can still enjoy the music and fellowship.

        BASTARDS - ALL OF THEM   
Ok, so I go ahead and delete my webpage and then try to republish it.  NOPE - nothing doing.  The Front Page Server Extensions on the Cox server are out of commission.  This rankles me - BIG TIME.  I get on the live tech support chat to ream "Paul" a new one - he tells me they have been down for 3 days and he's sorry as hell.  As fast as my little fingers can type I let "Paul" know just how sorry he and the freakin' Cox horse he rode in on are.  He then sheepishly gives me 3 days of credit for my high speed internet.  I tell him that is all fine and dandy but it doesn't solve my webpage issues.  I red-ass spanked the guy via the live chat - it was a moment.  He told me to use FTP and signed off like the weasel he is and leaves me STEAMING about the whole thing.  I know nothing of FTP which is why I am using the g-golly Front Page.  I am totally pissed off.  Cox are bastards - all of them.

        PARENTAL RANTS N' RAVES   
My darling ballerina daughter turns 14 years old on Saturday.  She is having a boy/girl party with a guest list as long as your arm.  The girls - about 7 of them - will be spending the night.  The boys, much to their chagrin, will NOT be spending the night. They have plans to swim and "chill" as my daughter puts it.  I am glad the party doesn't start until late in the afternoon so I have plenty of time to self-medicate beforehand.  
Now when I asked my tiny dancer what she wanted for a gift she excitedly told me she wanted  urlLink  baby blue Converse  shoes.  She was all a'twitter because baby blue is her "signature color" and Converse shoes are - apparently for the teen set - the hottest thing going.  Alrighty then.  Shows how "hip" I am that I would not know that.    So today on my lunch hour I do the mad dash to  urlLink Journeys  at Metrocenter. This store gives me no amount of a pain in the ass but I went anyway.  That's how much I love her.  I get there and tell the gnarly dudes working the place what I want and what size.  These 2 twentysomethings then begin to SHAMELESSLY suck up to me calling me "Miss", "honey" and "sweetie".  I have no idea what these guys were smoking before the shift.  I tell them I need a women's size 9 and they say there's NO WAY my feet are that big.  I tell them they are for my 14 year old daughter.  "NO WAY do you have a daughter that old" the one goatee'd lad tells me.  "WAY" says I.  "NO WAY" says the dude.  I said "WAY!" and hand him my debit card so I can escape the ridiculous pandering.   
I am happy to report that I got out of there, got the shoes bought along with an iced tea for me, all within my lunch hour.  I am a driving and shopping Goddess.

        POLITICAL RANTS   
 A Terrible Example   
Fund-raiser for GOP pleads guilty in case of   urlLink child pornography .Richard Anthony Delgaudio, a prominent Republican fund-raiser who once said former President Bill Clinton was "a lawbreaker and a terrible example to our nation's young people" pleaded guilty yesterday in Baltimore Circuit Court to production of child pornography. Delgaudio took pictures of a 16-year-old girl.   
 A History Of Hostility    
 urlLink Sen. Rick Santorum's  remarks comparing the protection of Americans' privacy in their own homes to protecting bigamy and incest came as a disappointment, but, sadly, not as a surprise. Santorum's record demonstrates a history of hostility toward equal rights for all Americans, and that hostility is reflected in the attitudes of the Republican party leaders and many of the judicial nominees of President Bush.   
 Fair and Balanced Media?   
 urlLink Clear Channel Communications  infused the Republican Party with nearly $120,000 in campaign contributions. (It contributed $25,000 to the Democrats.) That kind generosity probably isn't lost on FCC Chair Michael Powell, son of U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, and the current target of heavy lobbying by broadcast networks in favor of fewer regulations.   
 The Voice of Reason   
 urlLink Al Gore  criticized the media and the current administration's war on Iraq and suggested an "unhealthy relationship" between the two at Tuesday's Seigenthaler Lecture.

"I admire these journalists who are covering this war who are embedded, but I don't want the owners of the companies they work for to be in bed with the government," Gore said.

Citing the continued deregulation of the media industry as a major problem, Gore held the media responsible for the role it played in the months leading up to the war.

"The relative intolerance of dissent on the part of the media in America led to a completely inadequate debate prior to the beginning of this war," Gore said.

        RANDOM MUSINGS   
 urlLink Hula Dancers  on the wind-swept rim of one of the world's most active volcanoes, in raffia skirts sway to music and chants as they prepare for the Merrie Monarch, the Olympics of hula competition.  Among those dancing on the summit of Kilauea this week were 13 men from the Hula Na Mamo O Pu'uanahulu hula school who are something of a rarity. Dance veterans say the number of men trying to preserve one of Hawaii's most storied and treasured traditions has been dropping for years after a revival in the 1970s.  
If you ask me a lot of treasured traditions have dropped since the '70's.  Wonderful traditions like the 50¢ well drink and  urlLink  Wallace and Ladmo

 Tuesday night.     The tux shopping went well.  The son and I had a grand time together.  He got a classic tux with a purple vest and bow tie.  He will be lovely.  We still have to order the girlfriends corsage.    
 urlLink 24  rocked - as usual -on Tuesday night.  It was a great episode with another blessed week's repreive from seeing Kim Bauer.  Ahhh, the writers must have gotten wise to the fact that her scenes are when we take bathroom/snack breaks.  However, the previews showed lots of Kim dressed in scanty outfits and sporting a big ol' pistol.  Can't wait.    
 Wednesday   
Had some sort of intestinal bug yesterday - I will spare y'all the details.  I stayed home since the bathroom here at work is NASTY (as I have stated before and really don't need to beat that dead horse) and usually uccupido.  Anyway, I stayed home in the comfort of my own bathroom.  The Immodium finally kicked in and I slept all damned afternoon.  Got up dehydrated and drank gallons of un-cola.  Unreal.  Didn't feel bad otherwise.  I am happy to report I am back amongst the living today.   
 urlLink The West Wing  was great last night even if it didn't live up to the promoted "kidnapping" special event.  That show is still one of the best on tv.  
  WORK RANTS   
Professional Development for teachers today so the Help Desk is mighty slow.  I have gotten several calls from the daughter at home doing chores.  She's ranting and I'm ignoring it.  We did get our windows cleaned by the female custodian today - that's wonderful.  Typical how they have the woman do the windows.  The Asian custodian we usually have is useless for anything except gossip.  He would sooner get SARS than clean windows, the bathroom or vacuum.  I won't even talk about the dust in my cubicle.

        TUESDAY "EARTH DAY" RANTS   
It seems like everyone wants a piece of  urlLink  Earth Day — even the Pentagon celebrated with an exhibit of green military technologies. But there also was plenty of dissent.   
 urlLink Children  held at Camp Xray, US admits. They have not been tried or convicted of any offence but are being held as part of what the US calls its war on terror.  
Top Democrats and gay rights advocates blasted comments by  urlLink Sen. Rick Santorum  in which he appeared to compare homosexuality to incest, bigamy and adultery, and they called on the Pennsylvania Republican to repudiate the remarks.  "The White House speaks the rhetoric of compassionate conservatism, but they're silent while their chief lieutenants make divisive and hurtful comments that have no place in our politics," said Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, who is sounding more and more like a real Democrat again.  
Speaking of real Democrats -  urlLink Gov. Howard Dean  said "The President who campaigned on a platform of a humble foreign policy has instead begun implementing a foreign policy characterized by dominance, arrogance and intimidation. The tidal wave of support and goodwill that engulfed us after the tragedy of 9/11 has dried up and been replaced by undercurrents of distrust, skepticism and hostility by many who had been among our closest allies. This unilateral approach to foreign policy is a disaster."

  PERSONAL RANTS   
I take the son out to rent a tux for prom tonight.  Do I know how to rent a tux or what renting a tux entails? NOOOOOOOOOO.  I am perfectly capable of ordering the corsage and the other "girlie" stuff.  This inseam and arm length thing is just confusing to me.  At least I don't have to drive the daughter to dance.

I wrote a nasty-gram to Cox and asked them what gives.  They wrote the following back:  
"We are experiencing issues with the Web Space in your area. Our network 
engineers are aware of this situation, and are attempting to isolate, 
and resolve the problem. Currently, there is no ETA on when normal 
service will be restored. I apologize for any inconvenience you have

        HEINOUS HAIR-JINX   
Didn't get all the shampoo rinsed out of my hair this morning.  Didn't think anything about it- figured I would just go ahead and have the "greasy" look.  However, unbeknownst to me when I was outside in the warm Arizona sun during breaks at work the satanic shampoo residue wreaked havoc on my hair and bleached the bejesus out of it.  Even my daughter noticed it when she came to the Help Desk after work.  I am not a happy camper. I am not a good suicide blonde either.

        EASTER UPDATE   
Didn't even put the Easter baskets out for the kids this year.  Since my daughter was a sleep over until noon and the son SLEPT until noon I just took the Walgreen's bag full of candy and slapped it on kitchen table.  I did get no amount of grief for it and the husband did take the candy out of the bag and arrange it on the table.  Called my parents and my brother to wish them well since I hadn't gotten my act together enough to send out cards.  I did chat with my other sister on the Yahoo Messenger while listening to Gospel from New Orleans on  urlLink WWOZ .  That was fun.  Then we all went to my sister-in-laws for dinner.  We had ham and beef stroganoff and enough margaritas to keep half of Nogales happy.  It was fun.  The son took his girlfriend and the family didn't scare her off - go figure!  Came home and called my oldest sister. All in all it was a nice day.  I was able to get my laundry done too - that was a major accomplishment.

Well, ibuprofen is a wonderful thing and seems to nip headaches in the bud.  For this I am thankful.  
Had a difficult night.  Went home and took the daughter to her marathon dance class night.  Came home and saw that my son had picked up the graduation announcements from school.  There were the lovely purple and white fine stationary announcements with the little business card dealys you put in them.  There was the keychain and mortarboard tassel with "Class of '03" on them.  That's when it hit me and hit me hard.  My son is actually going to graduate from high school.  I was weepy.  Then his girlfriend came over to shanghai him and as he was getting ready to go out with her she whispered to me that she was taking him to  urlLink Scottsdale Community College  to check it out.  I then asked her if he was interested in there because whenever I bring it up he's hostile.  She said to me "he's just scared to leave you".  I then got weepier and told her that he had always been like that and she said "yes, and that's what makes him so loveable".  They left and I sat down and cried like an infant.  She's a fine young woman and is being very helpful in getting my lummox motivated.  For that alone I will be eternally grateful to her.  I can see why he loves her.  
The weather here is not as warm as I'd like it.   The current temperature is only 68° and it's windy - hence the headache and allergies issues.  I really am ready for the weather to warm up.   I know most people in Phoenix dread the summer like folks in Minnesota dread the winter.   I love it though.  I am ready for some warm rays, some time to float in the pool drinking boat drinks and wearing shorts.  I am ready to tan.  I am ready for sun tea, hot car door handles and the populace of Phoenix to say "hot enough for you?".  Bring it on.  
 POLITICAL RANTS   
 urlLink GOP Hypocrisy   Republicans set a very high standard for patriotism: if you question the President of the United States you are not patriotic enough.  

 BARRY GOLDWATER QUOTES   
Somehow I am feeling in the mood for some quotes from "Mr. Arizona".  I may not have agreed with some of his politics but dammit he always said what was on his mind.  
"Religious factions will go on imposing their will on others unless the decent people connected to them recognize that religion has no place in public policy. They must learn to make their views known without trying to make their views the only alternatives."  
"There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs. There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both. I'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.' Just who do they think they are? And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me?"  
"Now those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth, and let me remind you they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyranny."

        WEEKEND UPDATE   
 Battle of the Bloat   
Fighting the battle of the water retention.  Happens every year at this time.  When the weather warms up my feet, ankles and face swell up like blowfish. I stated taking diuretics to get the fluid out and am swilling lemon or limeade.  Not really progressing on the bloat front however.  I still look like Chairman Mao with some puffy eyelids and lips.  Not attractive at all.   Seems I have like Axis of Evil Water Retention.  However, the husband and I found ourselves alone on Friday night so we decided to go out for dinner. Went to  urlLink Yang Dynasty  down at Christown. We were silly and slappy - not quite sure why.  We got the meal w/ soup and appetizer deal. It hit the spot but it was not a good idea on my part - WAY too much salt. The whole thing was majorly salty.   I guess it serves me right but I had such a hankering for Chinese food. I could feel myself retaining water with each bite I took........HOWEVER - THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WEIRD - there was a guy behind me who was talking about SALT through the dinner. I could not make this up.  I am eating and I hear this guy go on and on about salt. Different kinds of salt, what salt is good for, the history of salt. I am thinking "shit if this man is on a date he's not getting any". I start getting the giggles when I hear him say "....and then there's sodium chloride....". He's behind me and I am trying to be discreet and look over my shoulder to get a look at King Salty there. I am craning my neck and not able to see him without doing an "Our Gang" head whip there. I get to laughing hysterically. Richard could hear them but didn't know that's what I was laughing at. I am loosing it. We ate our dinner - snarfed it in fact. Nothing left to bring home.  Truly - we were swine. On the way out I get a look at King Salty and he was short, fat, bald with a bad combover and his "date"(?) was a tall white haired woman with buck teeth and high water jeans. I was ready to have a  meltdown there. We get in the car and I explain it to Richard and we are laughing our asses off in the Cruiser when King Salty and his Sodium Sweetheart walk up to the car next to ours, get in and go home.   
 Between a Rock and a Hard Place   
When we bought our house 8 years ago it had a beautiful and very old  urlLink Australian Bottle Tree  which we believe was planted shortly after the house was built in 1957.  The tree was wicked huge.  It was a spectacular tree - gave us a lot of shade which here in the desert is a luxury.  Well, 2 years ago the branches and leaves started falling off and we noticed that things weren't right with the tree.  Many calls and a few "tree doctors" later we discover it had  urlLink  Texas Root Rot  (another BAD thing to come out of the Lone Star State).  The tree had to be cut down.  We were all devastated and depressed that such an old and beautiful tree would die like that and leave us shadeless.  We did nothing to the yard for a long time - as if in mourning.  Long story short - we got over the grief and have tried almost everythng known to be reisistant to the fungus in the soil and been able to grow nothing but bodacious weeds.  So, after months of deliberation and free rock from my father - we put desert landscaping down in the bricked area in our front yard where the tree used to be.  It's about half the yard separated from the rest by brick.  It took all day Sunday for us to bring loads of  urlLink river rock  down from my father's house up the road a piece and lay it out in our front yard.  We finally fnished and have the rocked part of the yard and the grassed part of the yard.  Best of both worlds kind of thing.  I am not the biggest fan of the rocked yards.  Even though I am a native Arizonan the desert "xeriscaping" has never been a favorite of mine.  However, we now have it along with lots of other people here in Phabulous Phoenix.  The weeds are gone so it's a solution to our "neighborhood blight" problem.  (Thanks again to the Fascist neighbor who reported us to the City of Phoenix Weed and Tool Shed Police)  But the front yard now looks good and best of all it looks FINISHED. We just have some small time planting to do out there and then it will be low maintainence and DONE.  I will be putting terra cotta pots out in the rock to bring in some plants and color.  I am thinking some flowering plant that likes full sun and heat for that rock out there will be a heat island unto itself when summer comes.  I am just glad I have my little floral covered entryway which is a small oasis of fragrance and color in our desert domain.  
 Endless Love   
Richard told me that when Bryce came home Sat. and asked him "Dad, how do you know the moment you fall in love?". The moment you fall in love. Unbelieveable.  I guess he told him there was no moment and that after the initial giddiness and "crush" thing passes you know you are in love when you can't imagine being with anyone else. Good answer. Then Bryce asked him how we handled him being away at college when I was still a junior in high school, etc. Richard told him point blank it was never any master plan - it just happened. We are the exception to the rule and it usually doesn't work like that and he couldn't explain how or what made it work. He thinks he covered it ok and was afraid to tell me about it.  I told him it's not the girlfriend herself I object to - it's how he's so STUPID in love.  The whole thing struck me silly and I got to feeling middle-aged.  For the rest of the night I was singing "FROM THIS MOMENT......" very loud for the rest of the night until the whole family told me to SHUT UP.  Sometimes it's best not to tell me the details..............  
 Parental Rants   
I know that the son's government teacher told me there was a test today (4/14) so I nagged him all weekend.  He left me a nasty voice mail telling me I lied - no test today and that he owes me a weekend of "badgering" to pay me back.  Somehow I feel I am getting the raw end of this deal.  The minor mom-nagging he got was no where near the magnitude of teen-badgering that I will be receiving.  I do live a charmed life.

 Bush issues new warning to  urlLink Syria    
President Bush warned Syria on Sunday not to harbor fleeing Iraqi leaders and asked for patience as the United States and its coalition allies restore order in Iraq. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said earlier Sunday that some top members of Saddam Hussein’s government had taken refuge in Syria.  Bush also contended that Syria has chemical weapons, a charge made in recent CIA reports and one that has been denied by Syria.Bush warned Syria and the other members of his “axis of evil,” Iran and North Korea, that Iraq’s example shows “we’re serious about stopping weapons of mass destruction.”

 urlLink European  leaders, meanwhile, urged Washington to tone down its rhetoric and stressed the need for dialogue with Damascus.

The dinner at the mother-in-law's house last night was heinous.  I won't go into detail but it involved fondue and kabobs made from meat frozen from Christmas.  Say no more.   
The son is in love.  Quit his job under the premise of "not keeping up with schoolwork" and wanting to graduate in 6 short weeks.  However, since the departure from his little job he has not done any homework but has instead spent every non-school waking hour with his beloved.  He's mooney-eyed and twitterpated and "revolting" as my husband so eloquently stated.  Hard for us, as high-school sweethearts, to tell him that he doesn't want to get serious about anyone right now.  We are not the pillars of authority on this matter.  
The daughter has a new outfit and will go to the school's talent show and dance tonight.  She is hotly pursuing her own personal "hottie".  After the dance there will be 2 - count 'em 2 - teenage girls spending the night at our house.  Have mercy.

The definitive answer on the  urlLink shoe  issue that's been haunting me for days."IT IS ONE of the strongest insults in the Arab world — sticking the sole of your shoe in somebody’s face, in a culture where the foot is considered the dirtiest part of the body. And flogging someone with your footwear, says Georgetown University Arab studies professor Samer Shehata, is a certain-sure symbol of disrespect.  So that explains why Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed Sahhaf said that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and President Bush “only deserve to be hit with shoes.”

        PERSONAL/PARENTING RANTS   
Going to my mother-in-law's house for dinner tonight.  Big-ass family thing since the husband's brother is in town from Atlanta with one of his sons checking out colleges.  We will have the whole family (4 kids) and their spouses and children there. A regular madhouse.  Too many people and not enough chairs.  We will eat way too much.  Then they will sing or play games.  Forever.  Can you tell I am STOKED to go?   
My son still can't decide what he wants to be when he grows up.  I feel his pain.  He will probably go to community college and "find himself" while living at home for a couple years.  He went with his father and uncle and cousin up to  urlLink NAU  to have a look-see yesterday.  I was really, really hoping that the sight of some fine looking Lumberjack coeds would make him want to change his mind and attend there.  This would entail moving away by 2 hours and moving into a dorm.  I think this would be a good idea but he doesn't think he knows what to major in yet.  urlLink GCC  here he comes.

One of my co-workers was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  He has a blood clot in his leg.  His foot had been hurting and he went into the doctor - luckily.  He is being treated pharmaceutically today and if nothing improves they will get more agressive.  Not sure what that means and I really don't like to think about it.  Surgery is never fun and I do hope that he doesn't have to undergo any.  It makes one worry.  It also gives one time to reflect on how lucky we are to afford health care and to have access to that care.  Can't imagine what it would be like to not have that luxury.....

 urlLink Unit 5: Hospitality and Friendship   
According to Arab customs, the soles of your shoes should never face a person.   

Another Theory:  
"An archaeologist came running out. He had been looking after this remote site for 10 years, all on his own and he was just steeped in it. And he was so proud to have people there and to show us round. At the very end he asked if we could take a photograph so that he could believe that people had actually come to see it again. Then this man, who had come out at five in the morning, with his immaculate white shirt and his pressed trousers, said, "But please don't take a photograph of my  urlLink shoes ." His shoes were so battered, because shoes cost about two years salary. This proud and educated man, who spoke five languages and is a world acknowledged authority in archaeology, said, "Don't take a photograph of my shoes.""

There has got to be a significance to it.  Sort of like "fart in your general direction" or something - must be pretty heinous.  They are ALL doing it - old men, young men, young boys - all of them taking off their shoes and SMACKIN' the statue.

Went grocery shopping yesterday.  To Albertsons.  Not quite sure why but it put me in a foul mood for the day.  I didn't have a miserable time there or anything.  It went well.  Commando raid - got the essentials.  Got home and the family helped put it away without the usual "locusts to the field" plague on the incoming provisions.  Not quite sure why it put me in such a miserable snit - but it did.  Was just flat out snarky to the family for the rest of the day.  Needless to say I was not their favorite person.    

I was the favorite of the dogs, however.  They snuggled me, foul mood and all, for the day.  It was grand.  

I have decided I am watching way too much coverage of the war.  I now know where the different divisions and towns are.  It's sad and needs to be stopped.  When I heard that  urlLink David Bloom  had died from a pulmonary embolism it made me realize how fragile it all is.  I had enjoyed this man's coverage from the front, riding with the 3rd Infantry on NBC/MSNBC. He showed a spirit and zest for his profession and his reports harkend back to Edward R. Murrow reporting from rooftops in London during the bliztkreig.  It was fine work and he, and his family, should be proud.  He will be missed.  It was his passing that made me realize I am watching too much war coverage.  There is so much more of life going on around us - we need to appreciate it.  We need to live.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The United States will have to go back to the bitterly divided U.N. Security Council for approval to tap Iraqi oil revenues for reconstruction or to award contracts to modernize the oil industry, a senior U.N. official said. The Bush administration has made oil central to its postwar plans, choosing a former U.S. oil executive to resuscitate Iraq's oil industry and saying it wants to use the nation's vast reserves to finance rebuilding.   

But Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said Thursday the United States as an occupying power in Iraq doesn't have authority over its oil riches.

I go into the living room with him and he informs me - "no, I don't want to talk about college - I want to talk about 'stuff'".  Damn, this has all the earmarks of some major league teen angst and I am not really up for it.  He then informs me that on Monday, when I called him in sick to do homework and he did jack squat, that his girlfriend had ditched school too.  What's more she came over to our house and hung out while they "made out".  What's even worse is that her mother found out and went medevial on her ass by grounding her, taking her phone away and not letting her see Bryce for a while.  He was visibly upset over it.  I then asked him, as parents must, if "anything happened" while they were here.  He told me "God NO - I am not ready for sex".  Ok, he's a 17 year old boy and I shouldn't but I still believe him.  So I then had to go into parental mode and tell him how he needs to make sure that he doesn't allow this girl to do things she knows are going to get her in trouble and that he needs to be more respectful of her and her mother's wishes.  He agrees but by the time we've hashed it out and I am on my way out to pick up Rose from the dance studio, the girlfriend's mother calls (her daughter actually) and wants to come talk to me after I get back from getting Rose.  Joy.  I tell Brcye thanks a lot.  He leaves for work like the WEASEL he is and I am stuck waiting for the mad mother of his girlfriend.  The mom shows up and we have a heart-to-heart talk.  The woman is deaf, a single mom and doing her level best to keep things in control.  I have to give her credit.  We talked for along time and have decided that we will talk to these teens and get them to realize they have responsibilites and to not jeopardize their priveleges of seeing each other.  My husband gets home and I tell him the saga of angst and he agrees that he will "talk to the boy".  However, I have maternal angst over this.  It's one thing for your father to tell you to respect the girl and the wishes of her mother and it's quite another to have your radical feminist mother tell you to WISE UP.  I have a feeling this seance is just unfolding...................
Rose has 3 hours of dance tonight which is why it makes Thursdays one of my favorite nights of the week.  I drop her off at 5 and don't pick her up until 8.  It's beautiful because I get to use the computer to work on my webs and chat with my sister.  It even better that she comes home from this 3 hour extravaganza totally exhausted with sore feet and it keeps her from busting my chops for a little while.

Losers, whiners and tenured teachers too stupid to own computers.  I mean, I have one of the loudest, laziest and WORST computers in the world but you don't hear me whining and crying because I can't do anything without my computer making so much grinding noise I think it's going to take off except for the fact it can't handle that much torque.  
On a comfort note - the weather is only in the low 70's today so I took the opportunity to turn the blasted a/c off in here.  I feel so much more comfortable.

"What has happened is clear. Bush wanted war on Iraq, period. He is surrounded by a mob of yes-men who also wanted war, and so they made sure that only the rosiest of predictions were listened to in the planning stages...... Bush only wanted to hear good news about the progress towards combat, and so he got it, and so here we are. These same rosy wrong predictions were disseminated to a media machine that was all too eager to accept them at face value.

 urlLink "24"  rocked the house last night for sure.  I think that show gets better and better with each episode.  I do love the plot, action and acting in that show with the exception of the daughter - Kim Bauer.  She must die.  No one can get kidnapped as often as that girl.  If the character weren't so STUPID maybe the writers could figure out something for her to do rather than run from one kidnapping to another with her breast jiggling and the wind whistling between her ears.    

 urlLink "American Idol"  was insipid - as usual.  They had to sing disco tunes and everyone wondered why they sucked.  WELL, it was  disco  they were singing there!!!  Man, that show is an like a train wreck - you just can't look away.  

Tonight is the best tv show on the airwaves- period.   urlLink "The West Wing"  is wonderful.  That show is  so  good it's almost painful to watch.  If only our real president were as smart, honest and decent as the one Martin Sheen portrays.  Life stops at our house on Wed. nights for that show.  It's a must see.

I drive my daughter to dance classes on M, W and TH.  I don't mind.  Well, ok - most of the time I don't mind.  I do enjoy those Tuesday evenings when I don't have to drive her anywhere though.  However, she has determined that since she's got a free schedule on that night she needs to go start hanging out at the Boys Volleyball games because the boy she has a "crush" on is there.  Geez, I had forgotten about being 14 and having crushes.  Anyhoo, last night I am driving her after work/school to a jr high in the area where the game is.  Rush hour.  Cramped my style for sure.  I ranted to her about her planning things on MY night of no driving and how she was being selfish about it.  She's already talking of her Friday night plans which OF COURSE mean me driving her somewhere.  Why the idea!!!  I am going to have to figure out how to nip this in the bud. 
On a weirder note: we drop by my parents house to drop off papers and there is my little mumselle in flip-flops (hot pink) and socks.  Good heavens.  I told the daughter that if I ever did that it was time to put me in the home.  She agreed she would.

I work in a portable building.  That's not the problem.  I am not fond of the way it sounds like you are walking in a double-wide trailer as you go get coffee but that is really not that big of a deal.  It's a good size building for the 6 of us in here and we have nice furniture and cubicle walls like a  real  building.  I like that it has a nice window on my side of the building and I can look out over the preschoolers at the school next door to the District Office.  However, the bathroom for our building is  NASTY .   I mean, I try not to use public restrooms anyway but that'sanother story altogether.  This bathroom (and I use the term loosely) is fouler than most.  It is one step above a j-john.  Truly.  We have a full time custodiall staff but they don't seem to see the  FILTH .  I cannot believe that's the same bathroom that people use when they come to District for training.   ICK .  Now some office prankster has decided to slap moronic cartoons of the "Dilbert" ilk in there.  I am not sure if they were trying to make the experience better for us or what.  I will say the only thing that will help is if the custodians  bring in the Pine-Sol and have their way with it.  
And why oh why, when it's 70 degrees and beautiful outside must we have the air conditioner on and cranked down to 60-something?  Makes no sense to me.

Hearing oral arguments on admissions policies at the University of Michigan and its law school, the justices aggressively questioned lawyers for plaintiffs and the school. The Bush administration’s top lawyer, also took part, arguing that the university’s law school program is a "thinly disguised quota"

this is what Arnett said: 
 "America is re-appraising the battlefield, delaying the war, maybe a week, and re-writing the war plan. The first war plan has failed because of Iraqi resistance now they are trying to write another war plan." 
I agree Iraqi TV was the wrong place to tell the truth, but consider: 
 The American assault  HAS  stopped or slowed to a crawl. 
We can say it's for re-grouping, or re-supplying, or we can tell the truth. 
The White House has been screaming cakewalk for months, and even the head general admitted 
"This isn't the fight we war-gamed against."  
 Last Friday, Britain's Army chief, Mike Jackson said, "Armies cannot keep moving forever without stopping from time to time to regroup, to ensure their supplies are up. It's a pause while people get sorted out for what comes next." 
 I feel sorry for the young men and women, and I do mean young. Some of these kids are 20 years old and they were told all they'd have to do is welcome the surrendering cowards - but the cowards surprised us and fought back. 
 So Peter Arnett gets fired for telling the truth at the wrong time to the wrong people. The truth is bad if it's on Iraqi TV

The son used his parental-given day of hookie from school to do  JACK SQUAT .  He told us he'd be working on missing homework since he's been so busy working at the theatre.   HA!   Once again we fell for the ruse set by a 17 year old.  We have only ourselves to blame.  However, we did have a nice family dinner together - the first one for a long time.  As the kids get older those are just so hard to schedule yet they mean so much to us.  We had big-ass steaks, big-ass baked potatos and salad.  It was grand for sure.  All through dinner my son kept saying he "didn't want it to end".  It's the bittersweet feeling of knowing that he is exiting childhood and entering adulthood that is so hard on him.  He doesn't think we remember the feeling either and that's too bad.  I think it's something we all face and struggle dealing with.  I wouldn't want to go back and be 18 again.  The future is laid out right in front of you there with all the sparkle and promise of a better life while the longing for things to remain as they were in your youth is tugging at you in reverse.  It's rough.   Frank Zappa once said that "the best navigators don't know where they are going until they get there and then they are still not sure".  
At least we have our daughter to bring us back into parenting form as we deal with a boy-crazy, 26 days from being 14 and "almost a freshman in high school" teenage girl.  She still looks at us in disgust and says  "CHA ~~  WHATEVER!"

        GRADUATION OVERLOAD   
Graduation - a time of reflection, contemplation and exhaustion.   


It all started Wednesday night with a trip to my nephew's graduation on the field - like in days of yore - at  urlLink Greenway High .  It was hot, loud and the kids were on the field like when we all graduated lo those many years ago.  Had a real community feel to it.  It was a nice ceremony and my sister got to see her son graduate and interact with her much to the chagrin of her estranged husband - but that's another rant in itself. 
Then yesterday we had my daughter's graduation from junior high which was bittersweet for her as most of her friends that she has been with since kindergarten will now to to a different high school from her.  She looked lovely even through the tears. 
Then my son's graduation was last evening at the  urlLink Assembly of God  church where it was a packed house.  Huge facility with big screen tv's to see the action.  He was splendid in his purple cap and gown and very, very proud of himself.  The whole thing was videotaped and his picture taken getting his diploma.  His face while he got that diploma is beyond description.  It was awesome.  I am so proud of my boy. 
We all went out after that ceremony to  urlLink Applebee's  to schmooze before his all night parties.  Oi Vay!    
However, I couldn't be prouder of  urlLink MY GRADUATES  - one from 8th grade and one from high school.  This fills my mother's heart with many emotions.  The range of emotion is somewhere between Christmas and being buried alive.   

On a personal observation I must say that the  urlLink graduation speeches  this year were bordering on the sublime to the insane.  The bulk of the speeches this year seemed to have a whimsical aspect hence the using of Dr. Suess'  urlLink "Oh The Places You'll Go"  as a theme for inspirational philosophy.  I guess it's a good change from the  urlLink "Tao of Pooh"  from a few years back.

        urlLink ">Migraines  suck.  Down all day yesterday with one.  Had to be the angst of the weekend.  My older sister flew in from Austin - she had angst and issues a'plenty.  Then the  urlLink nephew's wedding  where he didn't invite my oldest sister (his mother) because he's got a beef that she and his father and getting divorced.  Then there are my parents trying not to take sides and be "neutral" when all that really means is the pump me for the info that the sisters gave me.  My brother is blissfully out of the loop.  Add into that family angst a wedding and a Memorial BBQ and this week where is so busy I won't have time to think and you have the makin's of a beauty of a migraine.  I was down yesterday with it and even though I took big-ass meds for it I can't see me to shake it.    
Did go out on Monday and get the son his  urlLink Palm Zire 71  for his high school graduation presents.  He's delighted.  He was taking digital cameras of the weekend parties and listening to his mp3's on the sucker.  It's a beauty and now I long to trade in my measly M100 for one of the new ones.    
Got the daughter eyeliner and nail polish for the graduation festivities.  Both in her signature color -  urlLink baby blue.  Good gift for a junior high graduation.

Although we didn't win the car for Bryce it's not that big a deal - we will get him the  urlLink Palm Zire 71  instead.  It could be worse - much, much worse.  Just would have been cool.  
However, what is totally cool is that my older sister is flying in from Austin, TX today and will hanging at my house tonight swapping stories and having cocktails by the pool.  We intend to do facials, pedicures and she's going to trim my hair.  My oldest sister will come over after the  urlLink Diamondbacks Game.  .  Then we shall stay up until the wee hour having a total  urlLink ya-ya sisterhood  night.  Even my petite ya-ya will be joining us. Should be a spiritual moment.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress gave its final approval Friday to $330 billion in new tax cuts for families, investors and businesses, handing President Bush a victory despite sharply curtailing his plan for lifting the economy from its knees.

   urlLink BUSH'S BASKET   
In the annals of infotainment, few moments match the sight of George Bush leaping from the cockpit of a fighter jet and striding across the deck of a carrier at sea. Top Gun: The Pseudo Event enchanted the public, horrified liberals, and galvanized the press. Suddenly media mavens noticed that Bush's handlers have elevated the photo-op to pure cinema. So what else is new? Actually there was something novel about this occasion, but it passed utterly below the radar. Discretion prevented anyone from mentioning that Bush's outfit gave him a very vivid basket. This was the first a time a president literally showed his balls. Check it out—your subconscious already has. This manly exhibition was no accident. The media team that timed Bush's appearance to catch just the right tone of sunlight must have chosen that uniform and had him try it on. I can't prove they gave him a sock job, but clearly they thought long and hard about the crotch shot.  

 DEAN WATCH  
 urlLink DEAN:  LAST VOICE OF MODERATION GONE FROM BUSH ADMINISTRATION.  Howard Dean today commented on the resignation of Christie Whitman from the Environmental Protection Agency and spoke out against the Bush Administration's disastrous environmental record.  "Administrator Whitman was one of the few voices of moderation in the Bush Administration. Unfortunately, her voice was muted by the Bush-Cheney obsession with rewarding their friends in the oil industry by rolling back decades of bipartisan progress on protecting our environment," Dean said. 
 DEAN:  DEMOCRATS SHOULD STAND UP FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS AND UNION MEMBERS.  "The DLC staff can say what they want about me, but they owe an apology to the 1.3 million members of AFSCME. Our teachers, our health care workers, and our state and local public servants don't need a lesson from Washington insiders about the needs and concerns of middle- and working-class families. What they need is a Democratic Party that will stand up for them."

Careful to put the administration spin on all events,  urlLink Fleischer  sometimes frustrated reporters by refusing to answer tough questions. He had an uneasy relationship with some senior Bush aides, too, but said his leaving was his idea.Fleischer, who said he wants to leave before the re-election campaign gears up, said his meeting ended with the president kissing him on the forehead  
  DEM WATCH   
Democratic presidential contender  urlLink Sen. John Kerry  criticized President Bush’s anti-terrorism efforts. “The administration has not done enough of the hard work of diplomacy, reaching out to nations, building the kind of support network” needed to catch and deter terrorists, Kerry said.  Kerry, once seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, is tied with former Vermont governor Howard Dean in New Hampshire polls.

 urlLink Boiling points   The dreaded day has come, and we all survived. We hit 100 degrees for the first time on Friday.  It's a purely artificial benchmark, but reaching 100, the century mark, forces Valley residents to face reality: a long, hot summer.

 urlLink The New Gender Gap   
From kindergarten to grad school, boys are becoming the second sex .  The trouble isn't limited to school. Once a young man is out of the house, he's more likely than his sister to boomerang back home and sponge off his mom and dad. It all adds up to the fact that before he reaches adulthood, a young man is more likely than he was 30 years ago to end up in the new and growing class of underachiever -- what the British call the "sink group."  
 urlLink Alpha Girls   
They use their intelligence and ability to empathize to wage complicated battles with other girls, aiming to damage relationships or reputations.They use phrases like “no offense, but . . .” when they are clearly intending to offend.

  POLITICAL RANTS & RAVES   

 LYING BIG - TEXAS STYLE   
 urlLink Task Force 75  -- the armed services unit charged with locating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction -- is packing up in frustration after repeated efforts to turn up any evidence of Hussein's weapons programs yielded nothing.  George W. Bush's 2000 campaign for the presidency was based in large part on the idea that Bush was  urlLink honest  while Clinton and Gore were liars. The phrase "little lies" stuck to Gore early, and he never shook it.
All of which makes it surprising that the media do not pay more attention to the ways in which Bush and his White House say whatever is necessary, even if they have to admit later that what they said the first time wasn't exactly true.  George W.  urlLink Bush does not lie about sex ,only about war and peace. Most particularly he has consistently lied about Iraq's nuclear capabilities as well as its missile-delivery capabilities.  Bush frightened Americans by claiming that Iraq possessed aircraft that could be used "for missions targeting the United States." He insisted that a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency revealed the Iraqis to be "six months away from developing a weapon." Both of these statements are BOLD FACED LIES, but they worked. Nearly three-quarters of Americans surveyed think that Saddam is currently helping Al Qaeda; 71 percent think it is likely he was personally involved in the 9/11 attacks.  
 DEMOCRAT OF THE FUTURE   
Howard Dean may falter, but he’s already made history: the first  urlLink Web-launched candidate  to go mainstream in the era of BlackBerry and Bluetooth.  Nationwide, thousands of Howard Dean supporters gathered at 250  functions on the same night, drawn not by calls or cards from the campaign but by a Web site, Meetup.com, whose founders didn’t envision it as an election tool.  
 urlLink Howard Dean  is right. Health care for everyone is a moral imperative. And he's out there telling Republicans that they should be ashamed of themselves for not supporting it. That's a real moral stand -- and a winning message for Democrats, too.  Health care as homeland security - To Bush, homeland security is an excuse for government restrictions on liberty, an ideal to which he pays rhetorical lip-service while cutting funds. Dean's healthcare proposal, however, would have a real impact. It would save money in the long run, by reducing the state cost of health care - and it would save lives.

After my splendid Mother's Day yesterday where I received the  urlLink Pasta Pro , a clean house and a trip to  urlLink Olive Garden  for dinner (even though I am supposed be boycotting them for sponsoring Rush Limbaugh) I was feeling mighty bloatational.  I drank only water w/ lemon today and came home to work out.  I did my  urlLink Karen Voight's Strong and Smooth Moves  workout tape.  I have not execised since my hysterectomy in November and it was grueling.  The abwork was especially rough.  I am resolved to keep it up, take off the poundage and firm up my flabby old body.  
 PERSONAL VINDICATION   
Argued with my dyed-in-the-wool Yankee father about Bush yesterday. Even though he's not a fan of the war or Bush he got upset when I told him Bush was AWOL from the National Guard.  He felt that he had experience as a Guardsman and deserved our respect as Commander in Chief.  So today I sent him the  urlLink link  that documents it and he sent me back an e-mail stating "It seems to be substantiated, so I have to say you are right. 
Where were the Democrats who should have pointed all of this out during
the election ?  And are they ready to bring it up in 2004?  Dad" - YES!   I think there's hope for my dear dad yet.

Well, imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning to discover that my wonderful husband had stayed up all night cleaning my house for me!!  I am truly blessed to be married to such an amazing man.  I love him so much and he does love me - rants and all. I am weepy just thinking that after all these years and all our trials and tribulations he still loves me enough to do something so selfless.  I am truly blessed.

I stayed up WAY to late last night.  I was working on my  urlLink webpage  and have gotten it pretty well finished.  I was stressing and obsessing until it finally posted and looks pretty up and walkin' good if I do say so myself.  Now I just have to nag the son and husband to get some info to me so I can do their part of it.  It was WAY past my 9 p.m. bedtime when I finally hit the hay and I am paying for it this morning.  I am totally slap-happy and it's only 7 a.m.  
Got an e-mail from Dan who wanted pictures of the oragami on the neighbor's trees. So there I am at 6 a.m. in my barefeet and wet hair sneaking across the street with the digital camera to take a picture of it for him. I RAN back home in a fit of giggles.  I just hope no one saw me for they will send me to the looney-bin.

        PERSONAL MUSINGS/OBSERVATIONS   
We have some weird-ass snowbird neighbors.  They are from upstate NY - not that there's anything wrong with that...however, the guy is in his mid-60's probably and has this raging lawn fetish.  He's one of those guys that mows the lawn in patterns so it looks like a baseball stadium...real anal stuff.  He is always out there mowing, watering and pruning his beloved winter lawn.  The day we were digging our front yard to prepare for laying the rock he came running over all excited - I think he had a putting green ideal in his head.  When we told him it was going to be rocked he turned on his heel and walked away.  He also has his wife out there cutting up the tree/bush trimmings with kitchen shears and putting the tiny pieces into Hefty lawn bags.  It's a surreal scene we deal with all winter.  But that's not what has me wigged out right now - it's his mulberry trees. 
All last weekend he was out there pruning the stinkin' mulberry trees like they were bonsai or something.  Then the wife was cutting up the dead branches he cut out into perfect little 2" sticks for disposal.  Wigged me out.  Imagine my surprise today when I go outside and there around the trunk of each tree are these little white paper dealys.  They look like origami leprchaun pipes.  Each of his 4 mulberry trees have them at the base of the trunk.  I am TOTALLY confused as to why they are there but suspect it may be some sort of arborist prescription for dead mulberry branches.  I have to say - if he thinks our rock looks ugly then he should take a look at the paper hash pipes on his trees.

 urlLink Full Disclosure Eyed on Halliburton Deal    
Halliburton Co.'s emergency, no-bid contract to work on Iraq's oil wells must be fully disclosed, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
 says, pointing to the Army's admission that the company has a far more lucrative role than originally believed.  Halliburton, the US oil services giant once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney has done business in Iran, Iraq and Libya for years despite US embargoes, according to documents released by Waxman.   A letter from Representative Henry Waxman, obtained Tuesday, said  urlLink Halliburton's  dealings with countries cited by Washington as state sponsors of terrorism or members of the so-called "axis of evil" dates back to the 1980s.  
 Playing 'Top Gun' for the cameras   
 urlLink Bush  emerged from the jet and declared major combat over in Iraq. In a political world driven by image and pictures, he has much to gain from that perfect media moment. Perception is reality, right? Democrats have launched criticism that the president's dramatic arrival on the USS Abraham Lincoln was little more than a campaign event for a president up for re-election in 2004 Rep. Waxman seeking a General Accounting Office investigation of the costs. 
In an interview with  urlLink CNN , Waxman said Bush used the troops as a "political prop for his re-election campaign" and called on the Bush campaign to reimburse taxpayers for the costs.   
 DIRTY POLITICS   
The Bush administration and the nation's intelligence agencies are  urlLink blocking  the release of sensitive information about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, delaying publication of a 900-page congressional report on how the terrorist assault happened.  
Intelligence officials insist the information must be kept secret for national security reasons. But some of the information is already broadly available on the Internet or has been revealed in interim reports on the investigation, leading to charges that the administration is simply trying to avoid enshrining embarrassing details in the report.  

 NOT EVERYONE IS AMUSED   
Quotes   
"A great lie has been told. There were no weapons of mass destruction, and Iraq never posed any threat. 
Inspections worked. The fact is that the United Nations disarmed Iraq. The war was never about getting 
rid of weapons of mass destruction. It was about getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He lied to send us to war. 
His lie caused the death of over 130 American soldiers and thousands of Iraqis. He is a murderer.   
George W. Bush does not have the right to represent the American people, if he told a lie. 
And he told a whopper. George W. Bush's war on Iraq was waged on a bodyguard of lies. 
I want the president impeached because he lied to the Congress of the United States.   
What happened in Baghdad last month was not in accordance with international law. 
What happened in Baghdad last month was a west Texas lynching. We can't allow a bunch 
of neoconservatives to hijack America. It’s not a right-wing fraternity pin-the American flag, 
we own it, the American people. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the other face 
of patriotism-the people of the United States. The other face of patriotism is the American 
citizen who gets up in the morning and carries out the duties and responsibilities of citizenship.

 A TRUE DEMOCRAT FIGHTS BACK!   
 urlLink Gov. Howard Dean  gives 'em all hell.    



"The great unspoken political lie, which comes from stages like this, is "elect me and I'll solve all of your problems.

The great unspoken truth is that the future of this country rests in your hands, not mine.

You have the power to rise up and take this country back. You have the power to give this party the backbone to challenge this President, and all of the harm he has done to our country. You have the power to create jobs, balance the budget, and bring us our dream, which Harry Truman put in our platform in 1948 - health care for every American.

The reason people don't vote in this country is that we don't give them a reason to vote. This campaign is about giving all of you a reason to vote.

Abraham Lincoln said, "A government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth." President Bush has forgotten the ordinary people of this country.

It's time to take our party back and it's time to take our country back."  

 urlLink Howard Fineman  says Dean is still
the Democrat to watch.  He says "Remember: To win the Democratic nomination, you need only Democratic votes -and plugged-in Democrats at that. In that small universe, you don't have to play the role of Top Gun to win."

After printing out a speech by Ghandi about how he would not eat until there was peace not out of obligation but out of will the family all pitched in to help me and stop fighting for the weekend.  I am happy to report that I broke the fast on Sat. morning with a mango.  It was - needless to say - delicious.  
The son had a good time at his  urlLink prom  and looked very handsome in his tux.  His date was beautiful in her dress and I am happy to report that they were home by curfew.  They even had enough time to do a quick jacuzzi before he took her home.  I think the nuances of this curfew and being in trouble thing is sinking in on them.  He was in a great mood for the entire weekend and was actually social with us.  I have gotten his graduation announcements prepared but have told him if he wants the money to start rolling in he better start lickin' envelopes.  So far - no licking has gone on.  
Since the daughter was at a sleepover on Sat. after her recital pictures the husband and I had the evening to ourselves.

"My condemnation applies also to those jellyfish congressional Democrats who are so loath to offend the greedy among us that they go blithely along with the tax-cutters.

  PATRIOT ACT II    
On Thursday, Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee defeated a White House attempt to give the CIA and the Pentagon new and unusual authority to investigate U.S. citizens. It would have been the first time in U.S. history that these two institutions were openly authorized to probe into the lives of Americans. In a closed-door meeting of the Intelligence Committee, Democrats rejected a measure that would have allowed the CIA and the Pentagon to issue "national security letters" requiring Internet providers, credit-card companies and other institutions to cough up the personal and financial records of their customers

 urlLink The Secrets of September 11    

"The tensions over the release of 9-11 related material seems especially relevant—if not ironic—in light of recent reports that the president’s political advisers have devised an unusual re-election strategy that essentially uses the story of September 11 as the liftoff for his campaign. The White House is delaying the Republican nominating convention, scheduled for New York City, until the first week in September 2004—the latest in the party’s history. That would allow Bush’s acceptance speech, now slated for Sept. 2, to meld seamlessly into 9-11 commemoration events due to take place in the city the next week"

Found out the son snuck out of the house to meet up with the girlfriend in the wee hours last night.  He's in so much trouble he has no idea.  I will ground his sorry ass so hard it will hurt his whole family.  I just hope that the girlfriend doesn't get grounded from prom after we've forked out so much moolah on the event.  If she is -well, bummer - they have no one to blame but themselves.  I am totally pissed at the kids.  I pity the fools.

  urlLink Today marks anniversary of Crane slaying  
During the early morning hours 25 years ago today, someone crept into unit 132-A of the Winfield Scott Apartments in Scottsdale.  The intruder grabbed a heavy object, likely a camera tripod, and bludgeoned actor Bob Crane to death as he slept. The killer never was convicted. The case thrust Scottsdale into the national spotlight.

In eight short days, beginning on Sunday, June 22nd, tens of thousands of Americans have contributed over $2.1 million online to  urlLink Governor Dean's  campaign for President, in an unprecedented and historic surge of support unmatched by any Presidential candidate of either party in history.  The press, pundits and the other campaigns are stunned.  As Governor Dean has said, "We are the great grassroots campaign of the modern era, built from mouse-pads, shoe leather and hope."  urlLink How big is the Dean phenomenon?   Even before Dean reported his total some Democratic strategists in Washington had begun to regard him as the man to beat. Money matters not only because it pays for TV advertising and hiring organizers in early caucus and primary states such as Iowa, but because it impresses potential donors and creates a sense of momentum.

  ANN COULTER IS A BITCH   
This blonde anorexic facsist must be stopped.  She has just published a book called  urlLink "Treason"  Reexamining the sixty-year history of the Cold War and beyond—including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers–Alger Hiss affair, Ronald Reagan’s challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall,” the Gulf War, and our present war on terrorism—Coulter contends that liberals have been horribly wrong in all their political analyses and policy prescriptions. McCarthy, she says, was exonerated by the Venona Papers if not before and was basically right about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government. Hiss, she says, turned out to be a high-ranking Soviet spy (who consulted Roosevelt at Yalta). Reagan, ridiculed throughout his presidency, ended up winning the Cold War in the history according to Coulter. And she thinks that her personal savior George W. Bush, also an object of ridicule, has performed exceptionally in responding to America’s newest threats at home and abroad.  “Liberals have a preternatural gift for always striking a position on the side of treason,” says Coulter. “Everyone says liberals love America, too. No, they don’t.” This woman is a major loon and major facist.  She is intolerant and catty as evidenced by her comment on ABC’s “Good Morning America” Tuesday where she answered Diane Sawyer's question of "who will sell more books -she or Hillary Clinton by stating  urlLink “I think she has a three-to-one pound advantage over me,”  said Coulter, “but we’ll see.”  Who the hell does this waif think she is?  Typical of the "neo-cons" of today - they get personal in their attacks.  Then, last night she was on  urlLink "Scarborough Country"  last night where she and  urlLink ol' Joe   were having a mutual admiration society.  It was disgusting.  The woman needs to be stopped from opening her toxic pie-hole.  I only hope that someday her bad kharma catches up with her.

Going to a political meeting tonight to watch  urlLink Howard Dean  make his candidacy official.  Democrat Dean has sought to redefine and broaden his liberal, anti-war campaign with the formal announcement of his candidacy Monday, promising to “take our country back” from “toxic” special interests and “irrelevant” party politics.
In a call to disenchanted voters of all political stripes, Dean said: 
“You have the power to rid Washington of the politics of money. 
“You have the power to give Americans a reason to vote again. 
“You have the power to restore our nation to fiscal sanity and bring jobs back to our people. 
“You have the power to take back the Democratic Party. 
“You have the power to take our country back. And we have the power to take the White House back in 2004.”  
 Dean  says "It is a call to every American, regardless of party, to join together in common purpose and for the common good to save and restore all that it means to be an American......Most importantly, I have wanted my party to stand up for what we believe in again.

 urlLink O’Connor wields immense power   
Apart from her role in abortion decisions, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has been a tie-breaking vote on racial preferences and on racial gerrymandering of congressional districts.
She was appointed to the Arizona state senate in 1969 and was then elected to two two-year terms. In 1975, she won an election as a judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court. 
O’Connor’s stint there led Arizona’s Democratic governor, Bruce Babbitt, to select her as his first appointee to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 1980. 
Less than two years later, on July 7, 1981, President Ronald Reagan fulfilled a campaign pledge by announcing that he was nominating the first woman to the Supreme Court. 
O’Connor was born in El Paso, Texas on March 26, 1930. She grew up on the 160,000-acre Lazy B cattle ranch that her grandfather had established in 1880 on the Arizona-New Mexico border.

        EVE OF THE SUMMER SOLSTICE MUSINGS   
 urlLink Summer Solstice  in 2003, summer begins June 21, 3:10 P.M. EDT .  Oh boy, the first day of summer in Phoenix.............ahhhhhh, let the games begin.   I always wince when I hear the phrase  urlLink "…but it’s a dry heat"....  because wet or dry, 110+ is hot.  You can say "dry heat" all you want but when you peel your wet ass off the car seat it doesn't seem like it makes much difference but actually it is indeed a  urlLink DRY HEAT  .
You see in Phoenix, you sweat, but you don't know it. You can feel your body undergoing the process of sweating, but the moisture evaporates so quickly from your skin that no sweat actually develops. It's like the atmosphere sucks the water right out of your body. For that reason Phoenix has been named the  urlLink sweatiest city in the US  by the makers of Old Spice deodorant products. And that's why you take a water bottle with you everywhere - in the car, to the mall, or on a walk if you are feeling so bold. You have to make sure you don't dehydrate. They even passed a law here that no restaurant can refuse anyone a glass of water for any reason. It's a matter of life and death sometimes. 
The evaporative cooling effect is perhaps the hardest for non-Arizonans to fathom. 

Ah yes, summer in the desert.  Soon and very soon we shall ALL be crazy from the heat.

Well, worked until just 10:30 yesterday.  Had an appointment for a  urlLink mammogram  at 11 a.m. - have to have those yearly now since I am "at that age" says the doctor.  A real treat.  The place was mobbed and it took damned near an hour and half to get through that process.   At least this year the technician was different so I didn't get ridiculed about my diminuitive breast size like the last 2 years.   
Went to the dentist after that and got my sore tooth looked at.  Seems as though I have a fractured molar under a filling.  I will go in July 14 where they will remove the old silver filling, bond and seal the fracture and put a new filling - tooth colored instead of silver - which will bond up and hold the fracture.  The dentist said that my sore jaw was from favoring the tooth and grinding my teeth at night.  He was a very nice man and he gave me  urlLink hydrocodone  for pain.  This is a very, very good thing.

 urlLink Why President Bush fell off a Segway in Kennebunkport  
"You have to turn it on," explained Segway spokeswoman Stacy Ferguson, whose office had spoken to White House officials after the incident. In all likelihood, she said, Bush "didn't see the display." (That display is green, with a smiley face, if the unit is ready to go. Maybe the president didn't see the blank screen.) The president was holding a tennis racket when he got on, so perhaps he was distracted. "We have been saying that the Segway is great on the sidewalk, but it's not meant for the tennis court," ventured Ferguson -- though the president was on a driveway. In any event, it's now clear that Middle Eastern policy isn't the only area in which Bush can be unbalanced from time to time.  
 urlLink Former Aide Takes Aim at War on Terror  
Five days before the war began in Iraq, as President Bush prepared to raise the terrorism threat level to orange, a top White House counterterrorism adviser unlocked the steel door to his office, an intelligence vault secured by an electronic keypad, a combination lock and an alarm. He sat down and turned to his inbox. 
"Things were dicey," said Rand Beers, recalling the stack of classified reports about plots to shoot, bomb, burn and poison Americans. He stared at the color-coded threats for five minutes. Then he called his wife: I'm quitting.
Beers's resignation surprised Washington, but what he did next was even more astounding. Eight weeks after leaving the Bush White House, he volunteered as national security adviser for Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), a Democratic candidate for president, in a campaign to oust his former boss. All of which points to a question: What does this intelligence insider know?   


 urlLink Howard Dean "I will tell you why people should choose me over George W. Bush. Some of us opposed the Iraq War and some of us supported it. But all of us believe what President Bush is doing in Iraq now is a travesty. His administration was so eager to rush to war, based on phony evidence, that it didn't give serious thought to the aftermath. All of us think that he's playing roulette with nuclear weapons. The world is a more dangerous place as a result of Bush's adventures and his failure to take homeland security seriously. "

  POLITICAL RANT   
There are no real winners in the $6.4 billion  urlLink state budget  package adopted by the Legislature last week. 

Classroom education funding, which makes up nearly half of the state General Fund, clearly became the highest priority of lawmakers and activists. Basic state aid to school districts would grow by 2 percent over this year, as required by a voter-approved law, and other programs such as early childhood education would remain intact. 

But it's hard for  Valley parents and educators to believe schools would be "fully funded" when districts are laying off teachers and the budget includes a policy change related to utility expenses that would cost some districts millions of dollars. 

"We're not completely happy. Arizona is 49th in per pupil spending, and it's going to stay 49th in per pupil spending," said Chuck Essigs, adviser to the superintendent in the Mesa Unified School District and director of government relations for the Arizona Association of School Business Officials. "But we appreciate the governor and Legislature doing what they can in the difficult economic times we're facing. They did make education a priority."

Bush and Ashcroft have shown that they can pluck the emotional string of Americans on the terrorist threat, and parlay it into colossal popularity ratings in the polls.

 urlLink Bob Crane's Condo  for Sale on EBay 
The actor lived in the Scottsdale condo before he was bludgeoned to death with a tripod in a hotel room on June 29, 1978. 
Real estate agent Ardy Haines said the current owners, Ron and Pat Herbst, hope to cash in on the publicity surrounding the 25th anniversary of Crane's death.  
* here's a sniglet of personal information in relation to the above story.  My friend's father was stage manager at the theatre Crane was working at.  She would work summers for the theatre by doing housecleaning on the condo that they rented for the stars of the shows.  She would clean the condo that good ol' Bob would do his wild stuff in.  She would go in and clean in the mornings and if she had not called in sick on June 29, 1978 she would have been the one to find Bob dead.   Weird huh?  She has always lived a charmed life.

  PARENTAL RANTS   
The son had his 18th birthday party last night.  Well, actually it started at 3.  They swam in the pool, listened to music and painted up my son's car.  I had a full time job trying to keep a close eye on some of the "couples" who would sneak off to bathrooms, closets and tool sheds to play grab-ass.  I swear these kids have no shame.  Anyhoooooooo, we feed them burgers and Mtn. Dew and Doritos and the son opens his gifts which he's thrilled with.  I go to my meeting and come back to find them playing a game - that's cool.  I go to bed at around 10:30 and they are loud but I get to sleep ok.  Leave the husband in charge.  Well, about 2 a.m. we are awakened to the spotlight from the  urlLink Phoenix Police  helicopter shining in our bedroom window.  It was like being in S. Central there.  My son is running in telling his father that the cops followed them home and had the spotlight on them out front and they needed his help.  My husband gets up and gets dressed and goes outside.   There were 6 squad cars and the chopper in front of our house.  One cop is putting one carload of kids on the sidewalk with their hands over their heads and my husband is trying to get a straight story as to what is going on since it sure looked like the freakin' crime of the century out there.  We find out that the kids went for a drive and stopped at the grocery store and bought some  urlLink limes  which were on sale 6 for $1.  Then they went cruising in 2 separate cars and while driving down 19th Avenue towards home they started a silly game of pitching the limes at each other - trying to throw them in the car windows.  Well, a concerned citizen of Phoenix called 9-1-1 and reported that there was a case of "road rage in progress".  Seems the citizen construed the limes for something more ominous.  Well, after my husband found that out and the one cop in charge said "we have a lot of racehorses on this!" he got the cops called off and only one patrol car stayed behind and hipped my husband that they were going to "scare the kids straight".  He pulled a story out of his ass that they would "fine" the kids - but it would show up on their parent's water bill.  Told them to prepare their parents for a $500 water bill.  Some of the kids were freaking out and a couple of the guys knew it was BS and were calling the cops "Keystone Cops" and "Barney Fifes".  My husband got them to stifle long enough for the authorities to leave then told them it was all a ruse.  He then told them to go home, disperse, intermarry and move into condominiums.  I found out the whole story this morning and am just disappointed in the way they treated those limes.  No respect for perfectly good citrus.  I mean,  I have gin and tonic in the house.   It's a shame.

 Arizona House of Representatives adjourns without budget  
 urlLink The House's  attempt to approve a budget ground to a stalemate late Tuesday night, leaving the fates of the $6.4 billion compromise plan and an unrelated bill to help universities build $400 million in research labs up in the air.....Rep. Gary Pierce, R-Mesa, told the moderates he and his fellow conservatives were uncomfortable with the Senate's compromise budget, which took spending to $6.4 billion, up from $6.2 million, and restored dozens of education and social service programs that the House had voted to cut.

        PARENTAL RAVES   
18 years ago today the doctor said "it's a boy" and placed a tiny person across my belly.  My husband and I were shocked and awed to say the least.  He was the perfect, most beautiful baby boy in the world.  He grew into the worst 2 year old on the face of the planet and had, still has, a remarkable creative steak that would have us "on a boat, right?" when on our waterbed, making "throwing machines" out of buckets and broom handles and computers out of Legos and egg crates.  He was obsessed with "Ghostbusters" and dreamed of being one someday. I hope he does.  He developed a keen sense of humor, of irony and justice.  He is a remarkable man and a wonderful son.  He has shown me how to be a better parent and most importantly a better person.   I am so blessed to have been given this fine human to share the last 18 years with.   
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRYCE!!!!  
 PERSONAL RANTS   
Cuts and layoffs at work.  Our department lost 2 people and many more with hours cut.  Emergency Board Meeting tonight - shame I won't make it.  People are missing the big picture here.  The blame lies not with the schools, the school administrators or even our Board - the blame lies squarely with the Arizona State Legislature who refused to come up with a budget that adequately funds education.   Arizona is a sadder state for this reason.  My workplace is a sadder place for the same reason.  
Tonight I go to a meeting with Arizona Democrats and have my name put on the floor for nomination as Precinct Chairperson for Orangewood Precinct.  I am working for a greater good now.  I owe it to my children.

With tongue planted firmly in cheek: 
 urlLink Luxury SUV Buyers Win Desperately Needed Tax Break 
Drivers of luxury sport-utility vehicles who sat through gridlock traffic over the Memorial Day 
weekend now have a real reason to celebrate. President Bush has signed into law the Jobs and 
Growth Reconciliation Act, which increases deductions to $100,000 for vehicles weighing 
over 6,000 pounds. So now, instead of suffering the humiliation of a cramped "ordinary" SUV, 
drivers are encouraged to Super Size to a more roomy ride.   
 urlLink Standard Operating Procedure  
The mystery of Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction has become a lot less mysterious.......And anyone who talks about an "intelligence failure" is missing the point. The problem lay not with intelligence professionals, but with the Bush and Blair administrations. They wanted a war, so they demanded reports supporting their case, while dismissing contrary evidence.....It's long past time for this administration to be held accountable. Over the last two years we've become accustomed to the pattern. Each time the administration comes up with another whopper, partisan supporters — a group that includes a large segment of the news media — obediently insist that black is white and up is down. Meanwhile the "liberal" media report only that some people say that black is black and up is up. And some Democratic politicians offer the administration invaluable cover by making excuses and playing down the extent of the lies.  
 urlLink Where's The Outrage?  
Bush has been misleading the public about critical elements of his presidency, and yet there has been no outcry. Sure, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has been screaming about Bush's lies, as have a few other liberal pundits ( moi, included). The Democrats have taken a stab at branding him a deceiver. For awhile, they pushed the mantra, he says one thing, and does another. But that never took off. Bush's approval ratings remain in the mid-60s, not astronomically high, but higher than he deserves. He has gotten away with much. He sold his original tax cuts package with several whopping lies.   
 urlLink Arizona Senate leaders agree to budget plan  
Senate Republican and Democratic leaders shook hands Thursday on a 2004 budget compromise that would restore money for adult literacy, preschools and dozens of other programs involving education, social services and health care.Two developments cleared the way for Thursday's compromise. The Bush administration tax cut gave the state an unexpected $350 million one-time federal bailout. And state senators agreed to use Gov. Janet Napolitano's more optimistic revenue projections for fiscal 2004. While Democrats forced dozens of concessions, the plan is not veto-proof because several Democrats, and presumably Napolitano, remain unhappy that state agencies and universities must absorb $46 million in increased health insurance and retirement costs for employees, which the governor has called a back-door cut.

As opposition and dissident Labour MPs piled pressure on the Government, Mr Blair said the allegations by Ms Short were "completely and totally untrue".
Over the weekend, Ms Short, who resigned from Mr Blair's cabinet after the war, said she had concluded that "the Prime Minister had decided to go to war in August some time and he duped us all along".

Home at lunch and it's a lummox-fest.  Teenage boys sprawled all over my house.  Eating my food, drinking my soda, suckin' up all my oxygen.  I asked them how the job searches were going and got no response.  Tried to explain the nuances of the budget cuts going on at my workplace - it was lost on them.   They are just righteously indignant and want to "protest".  Raging against the machine as it were.  Ahhhh, youth.

 urlLink The principals  of all 32 schools in the Washington Elementary School District are urging School Board members to reconsider where to cut $12 million from the district's budget.   We must cut our budgets and keep the "same level of service".  I am not sure how this is done.   Times are lean and no one is safe from being cut.  I guess this is what our pResident meant by "no child left behind" 
This harkens me back to the "good old days" when we had Reagan and Bush41 in office and I was constantly getting laid off.  Nothing like the trickle down theory.  Never trickles down to us bottom feeders.  All I can say to my coworkers who are whining over possibly losing their jobs is "I didn't vote Republican".  You get what you vote for don't you? 
Just to cover all bases I went on line and looked for jobs.  Found a job as a dancer in  urlLink the Bahamas  but they are age-discriminatory.  I am past the age limit by 19 years.  The bastards.  I could dance my ass off in the Bahamas.  I mean, I have been getting up every morning at 4:30 to do my work out and have lost probably 10 lbs.  I could lose more, dye my hair to cover the gray and have Botox - just let me go to the Bahamas!!!!!!

The stress of the week - weddings, graduations, etc finally caught up with me and I have a miserable chest cold.  This is wrong.  It surely sucks when you have a cold and it's 105 degrees outside.  No way to get comfortable.  I have found that gin and tonics help.  However, it makes me feel slovenly and useless.  I am watching some great tv - mostly  urlLink IFC .  I have seen  urlLink "American History X"  and enjoyed it - even though it was dark.  I also watched  urlLink "Afterglow"  with Nick Nolte and Julie Christy which was good too.  
 The husband and I did leave the house long enough to go to  urlLink Fry's  for food.  This was good as we now have 2 teenagers in the house for the long hot summer.  We came home with bags of groceries and it was like locusts on the fields - they can eat it faster than we can bring it in.  Unreal.  They seem to like  urlLink Gushers  best.

        A STEAMY DOG DAY   
The storm did hit Phoenix last night. If fact the year's first large  urlLink monsoon storm  roared through the Valley , snapping telephone poles, setting houses and trees on fire and forcing Sky Harbor International Airport to shut down for 40 minutes.  Our power went out briefly and came on by the time we had found the candles - much to the kids' chagrin.  It was a classic Arizona monsoon with the wind kicking up, the dust rolling through first and then the blessed rain falling in torrents washing the dirt and heat away. However, the clouds have cleared today and we are hot and steamy here in the Valley.  I am hoping for a repeat performance tonight.    
I woke up this morning to exercise and decided to change my routine.  Instead of doing Karen Voight's  urlLink Strong and Smooth Moves  and give the  urlLink Streamlined Fitness  a try.  BIG MISTAKE. I am so used to the first tape and it has become like a Zen thing for me that I almost forget I am doing it.  Hard to explain but meditational.  Well, doing the new tape this morning just resulted in my FLAILING myself through the workout and not feeling like I did any exercise at all.  I think I shall stick to the tried and true workout tape. 
Then I decided to weigh myself on the scales which have been known for a while to be "lying bastards" (my husband said those immortal words the day we got them) and found that either he's right and they do lie like dogs or I have only lost 10 lbs after working out for 3 months. This hurts my feelings dammit.  Maybe I need one of those new  urlLink body fat scales  with features that make measuring and recording my body-fat percentages easier than ever -- not an altogether welcome improvement.  Rumor has it it's the best way to find out the ugly truth.    
Speaking of ugly truth - they say that  urlLink small pay raises  are being seen through 2004.  Employers (like MINE) are dispensing notably smaller pay raises this year — well below the 4 percent-plus increases routine before the economy lost its footing — and workers should not expect much improvement in 2004.    
 From the Irony and the Outrage Department:   
 urlLink Air marshals pulled from key flights  
Despite renewed warnings about possible airline hijackings, the Transportation Security Administration has alerted federal air marshals that as of Friday they will no longer be covering cross-country or international flights.  
but then the public reacts with outrage and *poof*  
 urlLink Flip-flop on air marshal schedules  
In an apparent reversal of policy, the Transportation Security Administration will immediately begin scheduling air marshals back on cross-country and international flights, MSNBC.com has learned. The move comes less than 24 hours after MSNBC.com reported that air marshals were being pulled from those flights because of budget problems associated with the costs of overnight lodging for the marshals.  
For the first time ever in his life,  urlLink Bush on Wednesday accepted personal responsibility  for a controversial portion of last winter’s State of the Union address in which he asserted that Saddam Hussein was seeking nuclear material in Africa. 
Perhaps that could be the reason that  urlLink less than half of US would vote to return Bush to White House? 
Less than half of Americans surveyed -- only 47 percent -- would vote for President George W. Bush the 2004 election, according to a Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll published. Some 41 percent of those polled said they would vote for the yet-to-be-chosen Democratic candidate. There are nine Democrats vying for their party's nomination.  I guess the American public finally woke up and were APPALLED!!!!

However, I read about the Danish beagle who's owners are threatened by the  urlLink Dognapper  with death if with a demand of a $10,000 ransom is not met.

In a move reminiscent of a walkout by House Democrats a few months ago, 11 of the state Senate’s 12 Democrats fled Texas for Albuquerque, N.M., protesting a second special session on congressional redistricting.  I saw we all meet in N.M. for some drinks and Mexican food.  We could have a blast.

Had a fine and restful weekend. Did nothing special but did get my house  somewhat  clean.  It's not spotless but the dog hair, dust and clutter is gone so that's ½ the battle there.  After we had all cleaned the  urlLink hounds  couldn't smell themselves on the furniture/carpet and that put them in a really snarky mood.  They can be such bitter beasts.

"I am optimistic because I see hopeful signs," Bush said, citing strong home sales, low inflation and high productivity. 

The president ran through a familiar list of priorities: tax cuts, accountability standards for schools and teachers, and faith-based social programs. On the international front, Bush outlined his commitment to fighting AIDS in Africa, highlighted his decision to station U.S. military resources off the coast of Liberia to help bring order there, and said the United States is making progress in the war on terrorism.

Ok - went home early from work on Wednesday thinking I am having a  urlLink migraine headache  - had to leave work before lunch as I felt my head was in a vice.  I got home before the hurling set in and let the kids know that I was home sick.  I then applied a Migraine Ice pad, put on eyeshades, took some meds and slept all afternoon.   
I awoke to a house full of teenagers.  I appeared from the room looking very lovely and they all dispersed - which was what I wanted all along.  The daughter went to a friend's to spend the night and the son went to work.  I sat with the chills and a  urlLink fever .

         WEEKEND HOUNDOG TALES (no pun intended)  
Had a lovely weekend and got some things accomplished and many things not accomplished.  I can live with that.  It was a relatively relaxing weekend which is always a refreshing change of pace.  I love the summer weekends where I can take it easy, enjoy the season and do what I truly  NEED  to do.    
 Friday night   
     We decided to go and try a new restaurant in the strip mall by our house.  It used to be a bad taco joint and now it's Greek - called Gryo House.  I am not a fan of the gyros myself but the husband loves 'em.  I did notice that they had  urlLink Falafel  on the menu.  Now, let's get this straight - I love a good falafel.  When we lived in Boulder they were everywhere and I developed a taste for the things.  We got some and decided they were OK.  Not the best I have had but they hit the spot.  They were something different for a change.   
 Saturday  
     I had plans of cleaning and doing a little work on my  urlLink suntan   but my daughter had other plans for my day.  She had been saving all the babysitting money, graduation and even some change rifled from the furniture and determined since we pay so much for her dance lessons that she wanted to buy her own school clothes.  It's unnecessary but it's a big deal to her.  Fine.  So she decides that she needs to go to good ol'  urlLink Ross  .  She loves that place.  She also suggests that since it's down at the same mall - I should go to get a haircut at  urlLink Supercuts   as it "provides hip hairstyles at an affordable price".  I took it personally and took a good look at myself in the mirror before we went and realized that the streaks I put in my hair a couple of weeks ago, when factored with the sun and the pool chlorine look HEINOUS.  We were down at the mall by 10:30 a.m.  I got my name in on the haircut waiting list from hell.   
     Then she and I decide to peruse the mall.  We stumble in to  urlLink Bath and Body Works  where they have the most delightful  urlLink Coconut Lime Verbena  scent going this summer.  Anyone who knows me will tell you of my obsession with limes - particularly key limes - not to mention coconut.  I used to tan, in my heyday, with  urlLink Hawaiian Tropic Oil  (sans sunscreen in those days) and have been seen in stores whiffing the oil just as sensory recall of the lazy hot days of my youth, lounging by the pool french frying myself into a golden honey-glow.   
     But I digress.........This stuff was almost as good.It immediately got me thinking of  urlLink Harry Nilsson's- Lime And Coconut   and pretty soon I was sniffing, spraying and  urlLink singing  the song.  This amused the daughter to no end as I sang and bought some body splash, shower gel, and candles in the scent. I got the daughter a bottle of some "Tangerine Mango" splash.  Fruity - but not tropical enough for me by golly.  Mine's a lovely little scent though - yo-ho - which puts me in an island mood and makes me want to bake a  urlLink Coconut-Lime Pie , cook up some  urlLink Coconut Lime Chicken , drink several  urlLink Coconut-Lime Rickey's  and book myself the deluxe suite at  urlLink Lime and Da Coconut Caribbean Villa Rentals :: U.S. Virgin Islands  .  Needless to say the stuff rocked my world and brightened up my humid summer day.  I got a good haircut by the Russian stylist complete with a "special" mint deep condition which was most cooling.  However, it did little to fix the gnarly streaks in my hair.  
     That accomplished we then went teenage girl clothes shopping and the daughter got great deals on some great clothes.  We went home and I cleaned the hell out of my filthy kitchen, did some laundry and promptly took a nap - as I am want to do. 
     That evening the daughter, husband and myself went to see  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl   and let me just say THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!  Johnny Depp was grand and the whole pirate thing (while smelling of coconut/lime) just got me.  The  whole  thing worked for me.  A job well done and I say " YO-HO " and 2 thumbs up for it.  
     We decided that next week we go see  urlLink Seabiscuit  since the promos look so cool, the book was so good and I am such a sucker for a horse movie.  
 Sunday  
      Got up and chatted via Yahoo Messenger to my sister in Texas while listening to the Gospel Show on  urlLink WWOZ  from New Orleans.  It's a ritual.   After that I did some more laundry and cleaned up the living room a bit.  Dealt with animals creating mayhem in my house and then determined that I needed to suit up and go float in my pool.  I did that and had my tunes going out back and a tureen of iced tea.  I floated for a couple of hours and it was very relaxing.  I got it out of the way before the heat set in and then took the daugther to finish up her shopping at  urlLink Target .  She got some good stuff and I procured some temporary BROWN hair color to try and see if I can cover up my heinous streaked mop.  Went home and hung out in the pool some more and made a late dinner of lasagna.  I went to bed early.  Too bad I did as we segue into.....  
  HEATHER WITH THE WEATHER   
Finally  urlLink Mother Nature is on her way as monsoon season kicks off .  She turned the knob on the Valley's monsoon this weekend and forecasters immediately began predicting downpours.  Severe thunderstorm warnings were issued late Sunday for east-central Maricopa County. Rain began falling in the West Valley and portions of central Phoenix.  urlLink Storm ushered in the monsoon   with white flashes of lightning that lit up the night sky Sunday, letting the Valley know that after a close call last week, the monsoon had finally arrived.   Of course the irony of this entire situation is that I was SOUND ASLEEP last night and didn't hear any of it.  I have been waiting, ranting and raving about the stinkin' monsoon for over a week now and it finally decides to show up and I am sleeping.  This is unfair and wrong and it truly bums me to zero.  However, The National Weather Service meteorologists in Phoenix say storms could hit the Valley tonight, with a 30 percent chance of rain predicted today and Tuesday  

 you know you've been waiting for it:   
  RANDOM POLITICAL RANTS   
     After the lovely relaxing weekend and the monoon finally hitting I have some rant in this category.  Bear with me - it's a lot.  Two days of pent up anger towards our government as it stands right now.  Of course, the things I am ranting about would all  fall under the "We told you so" category.  The headlines are chock full of it today.  It also falls under the  "If you aren't appalled then you haven't been paying attention"  category.  Hell, even the  urlLink Comics  are making fun of the Cowboy in Chief

The insurgency against American troops in Iraq continued on Monday with a new daylight attack that killed an American soldier and his Iraqi interpreter in north Baghdad. Monday’s ambush followed a similar attack on Sunday in which two soldiers were killed.

ABC's "Good Morning America" showed soldiers from the Third Infantry Division in Iraq criticizing Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and questioning their mission.

Well, they brought it on, and now my nephew is dead." 
 urlLink 16 US troops killed in Taliban attack  
Sixteen US troops and several Afghan militiamen were killed in two separate encounters near Spin Buldak and Urzagan on Friday night.

 urlLink U.S. Embassy in Liberia hit  
The U.S. Embassy in Liberia was hit by mortar fire Monday amid a rebel attack on the capital. One round hit the commissary building of the huge compound, located by the sea and surrounded by concrete walls topped with barbed wire. The U.S. military evacuated 23 Americans from the country and deployed 41 Marines overnight to reinforce security at the embassy in what could be a prelude to a 2,000-strong force.

     What this all means to us grunts in the trenches is that the pResident is ENTRIRELY beatable.  Of course, the Dems and the media are just now starting to WAKE UP and question things and realize that the urlLink  USA Patriot Act  Violates Civil Rights   -  NO..........REALLY?  
     In the meantime and between time - the  urlLink Green Party ponders it's 2004 strategy  to wreak havoc on the election.  They seem to be favoring ousting the current administration but there is not Dem that they like either.  In fact....the mere mention of one name in particular draws scorn from Greens: Howard Dean, who some strategists now see as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.

        PERSONAL RANTS N' RAVES ON A STICKY FRIDAY  
The morning edition of the paper reported: 
 urlLink Monsoon strikes out before hitting Phoenix  
"Close, but no cigar," said Tony Haffer, meteorologist in charge at the weather service's Phoenix office.  
Now this is just sad.......I mean, we get to use the "dry heat" thing a lot and if it's going to be "wet hot" why can't we have some weather - some storms - to spice it up and give us water?  My hair is BEYOND huge due to the humidity which really boggles my mind because when I went to  urlLink Maui  and to  urlLink New Orleans  where it's pretty damned humid my hair looked GREAT!  Same thing when we would go back to  urlLink New Hampshire  summers as a kid.  My hair would be awesome.  A thing of freakin' beauty!!!  So just what gives with a small amount of humidity in the desert heat and my hair going Janis Joplin on my ass?  It somehow doesn't seem fair...........and speaking of not fair - let's look at the
 urlLink  lottery results . Why the hell can't I win big money?  It would sure make my life a lot easier and fun too.  College for the boy, boarding school for the girl and a deluxe condo for the husband, hounds and me.  Ahhhh, that would be the life wouldn't it?    
I would also like to have won the urlLink  Worst Writing Award .  That would have been fun.  I think I shall work all year on winning next year.  Make it a personal improvement goal.  
 Who am I trying to kid?  
  POLITICAL RANTS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES  
Alterman rocks.  Plain and simple.  He can sum the whole thing up.  Like this: 
 urlLink 'Lyndon B. Bush'?  
At some point, something had to give. Yes, much of the mainstream media treated George W. Bush with Lewinsky-like devotion, but could it really go on forever? The Bush people seemed to think it could, and in their hubris lies their demise. 

It was an amazing run. They won the presidency by losing an election. They bankrupted the treasury, trashed the environment, turned the nation's system of justice over to religious fanatics and, finally, deceived the nation into an unprovoked war. They probably would have gotten away with that too, except they forgot to make any sensible plans about how to run the place afterward. ("Dude, where's my 'coalition'?") In the ensuing chaos and guerrilla warfare against the vulnerable and undermanned US forces, well, somebody was bound to start asking questions.   
 urlLink Benson's View  is right on - it IS a stinkin' house of cards!  
Now - how about a good conspiracy theory?  This is choice....... 
 urlLink Body found in U.K. fuels Iraq row  
Adding mystery to the controversy over pre-war intelligence gathering, British police said a body found Friday matches the description of a missing British Ministry of Defense adviser. The adviser had been suspected of being a source for a news report that Britain doctored information on Iraq’s weapons programs in order to bolster the case for war.  
Now isn't that convienient?

We did have a bit of a wind storm last night - but it wasn't a  urlLink Haboob .  It did cover the Valley with dust and give us that "Phoenix smell" of heat, dirt, sweat and chlorine you find nowhere else in the world.  The  urlLink  cicadas   are singing and calling for the rain giving a tune to the heat.  The humidity is on the rise and the barometer is falling - whatever that means.  Beats me but I do know it's making life miserable for us  urlLink Girls with Curls  - the frizz factor is intense.  It goes well with the tan I am told.  I think I need to buy some  urlLink hair product  in bulk if the rains don't start soon.   
Once the rain starts the desert will come alive with activity and we shall all be washed clean of the dirt and dust of the Valley.

Took great care of me and loaded me up so high and wide with novocaine that I STILL cannot feel the right half of my face and it's been over 2 hours!  I am talking like a damned drunk here.  Anyhoooooo, I asked about painkillers and they said call tomorrow if it was bad as that might mean I need a crown.

Today was the day I was SUPPOSSED to get my sore tooth taken care of.  Had an appointment for 3 and everything.  Figured that since I was having that done I would go an get the follow-up
 urlLink mammogram  since the last one in June showed an "area" that needed further testing.  Joy.  Since I had those two app'ts all lined up I thought I would be extremely productive and take the daughter to get her 
 urlLink panoramic x-ray  while I had arranged the entire day off with general leave.  Make the most of it as it were.  WRONG.  The damned dentist calls me Friday at 2:30 to reschedule for Tuesday at 3 instead.  I was pissed since it was too late to reschedule the other app'ts and that meant I would have to take the day off anway since the app't times were throughout the day and then take a couple MORE hours off Tues. to go to the dentist.  I was truly pissed to have my near idyllic schedule messed with.   
But I did make the most of the time off on this truly hot day by doing the errands and then coming home to do some laundry, do some cleaning and best of all - take a nap.  I love my naps.   The nap made perfect sense considering we  urlLink hit a record high 116 degrees  today and we will now have to wait to see if Tropical Storm Claudette can jump-start the summer thunderstorm season later this week.  
 urlLink Seduced by the Sun   
"In summertime, the feel of warm sun on bare skin can be seductive enough to overrule reason. Is there anything more sensual than a tan line, marking the border between, say, a sun-burnished hipbone and regions below? Silently, yet with authority, a tan speaks of youth and sex, and evokes memories involving all the senses: the smell of the ocean, the sound of crickets, the taste of ripe fruit.....The same attention to detail was once typical of aggressive sunbathing methods. Cardboard reflectors covered with aluminum foil, plastic eye protectors, egg timers, cans of Tab and tubes of Bain de Soleil were essential to the serious tanner who came of age in the bronze age. The elixir promised a "St. Tropez tan" to would-be sophisticates, and whatever that was, it sounded so elegant. The amber goo seemed to improve the color and texture of skin on contact."

 urlLink Jimmy Buffett  and fans on the “Margaritaville” ethos 
Jimmy isn’t just a musician, he’s a lifestyle. 
Where exactly is the fictitious Margaritaville? It’s in the tropics somewhere between the port of indecision and southwest of disorder, but no parallels of latitude or longitude mark the spot exactly. You don’t have to be a navigator to get there. Palm trees provide the camouflage, passports are not required and island music rules. No waiting lines for anything. There is a beach and thatched roof bar perched on the edge of the turquoise sea where you can always find a barstool. There are lots of lies and loads of stories.

DEAN SAYS THOSE IN ADMINISTRATION WHO MISLED NATION SHOULD RESIGN  
"Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's statement yesterday - that he only found out that the Niger documents were forgeries -- "within recent days" was stunning. 
"What is now clear is that there are those in this administration that misled the President, misled the nation, and misled the world in making the case for the war in Iraq. 
"They know who they are. And they should resign today. "  
 urlLink Democrats Speak Softly On Gun Control  
The gun owners' Democratic favorite is former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. "My position is keep the background checks and the ban on assault weapons," he said, "but let states do what they want." With that view, he told the chairmen, "I can run in the West."

 urlLink Sausage-Suited Woman  Hit by Baseball Player Getting His Bat ... With Autograph 
The young woman inside the Italian sausage costume says she'll accept an apology from Pittsburgh first baseman Randall Simon, but all she really wants is the bat he swatted her with as she ran past the Pirates' dugout. 
With one swing Wednesday night, Simon sent 19-year-old Mandy Block tumbling to the ground in the heavy costume. A fellow racer dressed as a hot dog also fell.

        HEATHER WITH THE WEATHER   
Hot.  A  urlLink MONSTER  ridge of high pressure will park itself right over top of Arizona. We should see record breaking heat by Wednesday and Thursday with little relief in wind or rain. Some far away storms over the weekend could bring some blowing dust.  
 urlLink Searing heat could break 1934 record   
A high-heat warning signaling dangerous temperatures for all ages is expected today or Thursday. Temperatures are projected to hit 116 degrees Thursday, said David Runyan, National Weather Service meteorologist. The record for the day is 115 degrees set July 10, 1934.   

 urlLink Shade elusive in parking lots  
The mean summer temperatures  found at 15 commercial parking lots with different types of surface were: turf, 90 degrees; decomposed granite, 111; concrete, 117; and asphalt, 138.  


 urlLink Monsoon late, but why complain?  
The average length of the monsoon is just 56 days, but it accounts for more than a third of our annual rainfall. So it's a pretty important time for us, free water courtesy of Mother Nature and all. 

We think the season will start within the next five to 10 days, way before the record late start of July 25, 1987.

 urlLink Pullen  is pushing wrong buttons  
In Phoenix, we have mayoral candidate Randy Pullen blasting away at a day labor center for immigrants. He has chimed in also against identification for immigrants that allows them to cash their checks and send money home and about undocumented immigrants as a group too saturated with cop-killers and drug pushers. He calls for having local police act as branches of the immigration authorities.  Pullen's statements say less factually about immigrants than about Pullen.
Let's get this out of the way. No, they don't say Pullen is a racist. They say merely that that he very much wants to be mayor of Phoenix, doesn't care what he has to do to get there and is unfamiliar with the complexity of the immigration issue. Mostly, they say that he knows an emotional wedge issue when he sees one.

        RANDOM WHINING   
Work was killer today.  Hard to get back into the swing of it after almost a week off and being in Vegas for part of that week.  It wasn't busy but it was rough as a cob to get motivated.  I didn't even work out this morning due to lack of motivation.  This is not good.  
The son has been working at the dance studio doing renovations for them.  He's anxious to get paid.  He also got called back by  urlLink  Phoenix Theatre  to work a touring production of  urlLink  How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying  .  He's excited and so am I.  It will be good for him to work more.  He does still need to register for  urlLink GCC  classes.  
I did get the daughter to the Ballet Boutique for new  urlLink pointe shoes  since her others were toast.  She was thrilled. We then went to  urlLink  Macy's  and  urlLink MAC   at  urlLink  Biltmore Fashion Park  to use gift certificates she got at her dance recital.  We had a good time and laughed at the "snootiness" of the clientele.  She got some good deals and we left pronto.  We just don't fit in with that crowd. 
Came home to find the mother in law invited us for pizza to celebrate her husband's birthday.  The husband and kids went but I begged off.  I don't need that abuse after shopping the Biltmore with a 14 year old girl.

        HAPPY 4TH OF JULY   
 urlLink HAPPY 4TH OF JULY AMERICA  
Here's the  urlLink Bill of Rights  - I suggest we all take today to re-read it and try to live up to it.  America will be having lots of  urlLink  celebrations  around the country and celebrating our freedom.  Let's all stay dedicated to those freedoms shall we?  
  VEGAS RECAP   
We had a good flight up to Vegas - delayed by an hour due to faulty equipment.  We got checked in to the  urlLink Tropicana  and although we weren't thrilled with our  urlLink  Garden Room  on the first floor with a view of the parking lot after called the front desk we realized we couldn't switch to a better one. We found that the Trop is one of the oldest hotels in Vegas and we enjoyed that history aspect of it.  We also found that the  urlLink Tropicanna  may be the next casino to be imploded to make way for another Mega-Resort. This week we’ve heard a new bit of news that seems to confirm that something is indeed up at the Trop. I’m not sure about regular rooms, but the Trop will not accept any convention bookings beyond April 2004. If true, we’ve heard that the Trop may only demolish a portion of the resort and not the entire complex.  So we made the best of it and enjoyed our  urlLink view   
 We did join the  urlLink Winner's Club  which allowed us to get free stuff after playing the  urlLink slots  for a couple hours we got free tickets to see  urlLink  The Folies Bergere .  In a way, "Les Folies Bergere" may be the longest running entertainment of its type in the world. Born in Paris in 1866, the  urlLink Folies  went on to become the international word in sophisticated Parisian entertainment. Reincarnated in Las Vegas, the "Folies" has continued to pay tribute to spectacle style casino entertainment, first rate variety acts, and the top Vegas showgirls for over a half-century now. 

Jerry Jackson recently re-vamped the show to bring audiences a "sexier-than-ever" extravaganza, which includes "The Best of Folies Bergere," and the popular 1860's style "Bal au Versailles" number. Jackson sees the new, improved  urlLink "Folies"  as a "salute to women, from the days of the music hall up to today." Currently the cast of 55 is joined by those "Two Funny Guys: Mario and Daniel."   The show had the headresses and barebreasted beauties of long ago Vegas along with one of the prettiest  urlLink pas de deux  I have ever seen.  

However, after walking the strip and going up to see Caesar's Palace and looking around the Strip we have decided that by far our favorite hotel yet is the medium priced  urlLink  Flamingo  which is centrally located and soon with be having a new urlLink  Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville  will open at the Flamingo in November.  That sealed the deal and made it so we will stay there from now on.  We love that place and that's the hotel where the Elvis slot machine paid me $600 once.  
I am sorry to report that I had NO luck on the slots this trip.  We didn't lose a lot of money but we made none either.  Even the Wall of Elvis at the MGM had no breaks for me.  Bummer.  I am still extremely disappointed in the King.  

  DEAN WATCH   
 urlLink Should Dean Fear His Early Success?  
 by Howard Fineman. (R-whore)  
"This feels like Groundhog Day: Here I am writing about  urlLink Howard Dean  again for about the sixth time (in Newsweek or here on the Web) this year. But there is a valid reason: The guy is and will remain a central character—perhaps the central character—in the Democratic presidential campaign of 2004.
Dean has come so far so fast that the serio-comic question inside the Beltway right now is whether this formerly obscure insurgent has insurged too fast. The theory goes that he is a frontrunner now, and that, as such, he will be whacked like a pinata and that all manner of pink-wrapped liberal candy will fall out and voters will recoil in horror. At least that’s what the spinners are saying."

         urlLink YO' SHORTY  - IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY    
 urlLink HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!  
 urlLink Virgo's Birthday  
 urlLink today's horoscope   
That's right - wedged between  urlLink Madonna's on August 16  and  urlLink Michael Jackson's on August 29  there is my birthday on  urlLink August 27.   All 3 of us born the same month of the same year.  Must have been something WILD in the cosmos besides  urlLink   Sputnik  that August of 1958.  Turning  urlLink  45  which brings calls for wisdom.  Forty-five is neither here nor there. When you're 45, you're too old to be young and too young for the hotel discount. You hope where you've been will help you get where you're going, but even after 45 years, you don't know.  You're in the eye of the  urlLink hurricane , halfway to something.  I keep thinking of the lyrics to  urlLink A PIRATE LOOKS AT 40  by Jimmy Buffett and these lines sum it up for me:  
Yes I am a pirate, two hundred years too late 
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder 
I'm an over-forty victim of fate 
Arriving too late, arriving too late  
In keeping with the pirate and carribean theme  I hope that my family fulfills my middle-aged crazy  urlLink Hemingway  fantasy by taking me to  urlLink Bahama Breeze  for some  urlLink  Conch Fritters   and  urlLink Key Lime Pie . YA MON, that's the ticket.    
For an early birthday and anniversary gift my parents took my family to the  urlLink D-Backs  game Monday night and I finally got to see Randy Johnson, the Big Unit, throw.   It was fabulous.  The Diamondbacks won and scored 8 points so that means we got coupons for a free chalupa at  urlLink Taco Bell .  Nothing better than a win and a free chalupa!!!  We all had dinner at  urlLink TGI Friday's  before the game where I had a chicken caesar salad bigger than my head.  IT RANG MY CHIMES.  All in all I must say it was a grand time at the ballpark with the folks.    
  STILL MARRIED AFTER ALL THESE YEARS   
On Saturday the husband and I will celebrate our  urlLink 23rd Wedding Anniversary  .  We have booked a room at the  urlLink  Radisson Resort & Spa Scottsdale Hotel  and since it's off season here in the Valley we got a bodacious deal.  We are planning to go hang by the pool, relax, eat and reconnect.  We will be there from Thursday through Sunday.  It will be great.  We are hoping to get out to  urlLink Casino Arizona   to see the Showstoppers which everyone says is hilarious - Michael Jackson and Elvis impersonators et al.  Should be a HOOT!  Might play some slots too.  Then on Saturday - the actual anniversary itself - we will be going to see the  urlLink Azz Izz Band  play a gig in Scottsdale.  We go see them almost every year on our anniversary and the band usually announces the event.  We dance our butts off and have a great time but pay for it the next day with sore muscles and heads which will make us realize that we aren't kids anymore.    I just wish I could afford to have a body wrap at  urlLink The Mist Spa   at the Radisson. That would indeed take years off my middle-aged body and psyche to boot.  Maybe if I win big at the slots I will.  Of course, everyone needs a dream.    
All in all it should be a grand time and good to get away from work, kids, dogs, cat and house for a weekend.  We try to do this every anniversary to keep our marriage fresh and connected and so far it has seemed to work.  After 23 years of marriage I can honestly say I love my husband as much as when we started dating in 1975 or got married that steamy August day in 1980.

        AH GEEZ, GAS AGAIN!   
The gas stories around here in Phoenix are intense and a hot topic.  Of course, there's a guy in the cubicle next to me at work (the Milkman) who has serious gas issues - but they don't involve his car.........but I digress........  

 urlLink More pipeline woes, but lines ease  
Broken conduit ruptures in test; Calif. line shut down.  But pipeline company Kinder Morgan Energy Partners stuck to its promise to reopen a stretch of line between Tucson and Phoenix this weekend. There were fewer lines at besieged gas stations.  
 urlLink It's time to enforce the Law of the Line  
In the days to come there will be more tough questions about the crisis and who should face penalties. Politicians? The owners of the fractured line, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners? The station owners who gouged customers? There will be investigations, lawsuits and even threats of criminal prosecution. But formal inquiries are cumbersome, and the courts are slow. It would be better to act now and send the suspects to a local gas station to face the Law of the Line. Where justice, if not service, is sure and swift. And there is no appeal.  
 urlLink Experts see long-term Valley gas crunch >br>
The lines are gone. The pumps are running. The pipeline that brings gasoline to the Valley will eventually be fixed. 
 
 
 

     But even as the short-term crisis that choked the flow of gasoline slowly fades, motorists here will still face the lingering prospect of volatile prices, tight supplies and the possibility that outages will come again, according to independent analysts and representatives of the petroleum industry. 
      
      The Valley is facing a long-term gasoline crunch fueled by its dependence on aging refineries already running near capacity, vulnerable pipelines and no new options if things go bad again.  
 urlLink Benson's View   
  ENERGY SCAM   
 urlLink Energy Dept. Will Take Control of Blackout Investigation  Energy Department officials said that the investigation would employ hundreds of experts from federal agencies, national laboratories and the organizations that control the flow of electricity on the nation's power grid, and would take responsibility for discovering an answer outside an industry organization that had been leading the initial inquiry.  
  IN MEMORIAM   
 urlLink Cancer claims longtime congressman Rhodes  
Elected in 1952, Rhodes served in Congress until retiring in 1982. When his successor, John McCain, opted to run for the Senate in 1986, Rhodes' son, Jay, ran for the seat and ultimately won three terms. During his years in Congress, Rhodes worked closely with Goldwater, R-Ariz., and Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., to give Arizona clout not normally afforded a state with a small population.  
  ZEVON IS FADING LIKE A FLARE   
Watched the documentary about  urlLink Warren Zevon   on VH1 last night.  It's very poignant and it follows the songwriter through his personal journey with this terminal illness and chronicles the development, production, and impact of his album The Wind.  It's sad to see a man so driven in so much pain.  I wish him godspeed on his journey and hope he realizes how much we will all miss his music.

        CLASSICAL GAS  
The news that the  urlLink gas pipeline fails high-pressure test  means that  the 48-year-old pipeline isn't ready to start bringing 60,000 barrels of gasoline to the Valley after being closed for three weeks. A 4-mile segment of the pipe failed a high-pressure test about 3 a.m.  We were told earlier that  urlLink repairs, EPA ruling are positive signs in gas ordeal 
and the end of zooming prices, long lines at the pump and increasingly short tempers among consumers who can't find gas.  However, it appears that Phoenix can look forward to more gas shortages and lines at the pump that form as fast as a  urlLink flash mob .  For many, the  urlLink quest for fuel fills the day 
For some motorists, finding gas was like a cruel shell game as they waited in line, only to be turned away at the last minute. 
      
     An unlucky route choice could mean a fruitless drive for a dozen or so miles without encountering an active pump.     I for one am sick of driving only to be stuck in traffic heading for the pumps or run down by nimrods following tankers down the road.

        BLACKOUT 2003 - MORE ENERGY CONSPIRACY THEORIES   
 urlLink Utility Officers Gave to Bush   
The top two executives of FirstEnergy Corp., the Ohio-based utility that is a focus of investigations into last week's cascading blackouts, are key financial supporters of President Bush, according to campaign records.  Bush's campaign had no comment.   
 urlLink Blackout Probe Focuses on Ohio Utility  
Millions Spent on Political Connections 

Consumer groups say FirstEnergy has been able to avoid tight scrutiny because it has spent millions of dollars on lobbyists and campaign contributions. 

In 2002, FirstEnergy gave $1,044,807 to political parties — 70 percent to Republicans and 29 percent to Democrats — the 10th-largest amount contributed by an energy and natural resources company and the sixth-largest amount contributed by an electric utility, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. FirstEnergy spent another $2,259,975 on lobbying in 2002 

In June, the CEO of FirstEnergy, Peter Burg, hosted a fund-raiser for Vice President Dick Cheney that raised $600,000 for President Bush's re-election campaign. 

And when he first prepared to move into the White House, Bush appointed the president of FirstEnergy, Anthony Alexander, to serve on the administration's energy transition team.

        MORE ARIZONA GAS GAFFS   
 urlLink Company says pipeline shut down for safety  
A broken fuel pipeline that has caused Valley gas stations to run dry and motorists to run for the nearest pump could be reopened immediately at 80 percent capacity without testing it, but the company that operates it decided to close it, a federal official said Monday.   
 urlLink Phoenix Running On Empty   
Executives from Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, the Houston company that operates the pipeline, met with federal regulators Thursday in Houston, where their plan to test the line for safety and fix the rupture was approved. 

But company officials say it would be one or two weeks before the pipeline is running again. The pipeline is now undergoing testing to make sure it can withstand the pressure of the gas when it is operating again. 

The Arizona Corporation Commission, which oversees pipeline safety, is expecting to have an investigation into the line break finished within two months, spokeswoman Heather Murphy said. 

About 70 percent of the gas Phoenix uses comes from California, and the rest from Texas.   
Texas huh?  Hmmmmmm..........what else comes from Texas?

        ARIZONA NEWS   
 urlLink Lack of gas stuns Valley, more shortages expected    After days of skyrocketing gas prices, local drivers encountered more bad news at the pump Sunday: 

No gas at all. 

Hundreds of Valley gas stations ran out of fuel, leading to long lines and short fuses as anxious motorists searched for open stations with working pumps. The weekend outages were much worse than expected, leading Gov. Janet Napolitano to cut short her trip to the National Governors Association Conference in Indianapolis and return to the Valley today to address the issue.  
If Janet doesn't watch her step then she will soon be suffering the same fate as California Gov. Gray Davis.  Energy shortages are the things that the Republicans are drooling over because it gets the constituents angry and ready to recall.  It also might be because she snubbed the pResident when he came to visit the fire site earlier this month.......but wait - there's more!!!!  
 urlLink  Ruptured line creates gas crunch in Phoenix - Aug. 18, 2003  
Motorists drove on fumes from gas station to gas station Sunday night, searching for one that still had fuel. The stations still open had drivers lined up for hours waiting for their chance to pump -- and pay an increasingly high price for the privilege.   
 urlLink Benson's View   
 urlLink Rafting Napolitano sells Ariz. down river  
President George Bush invited the governor to be with him during his visit to the site of the "Aspen" fire outside Tucson on Monday. It was a late invitation, but she should have accepted.Instead, Gov. Napolitano was on the Colorado River when the president said that his Healthy Forests Initiative was the best possible plan for dealing with wildfires.

If she had been there she could have pointed out flaws in the initiative and perhaps suggested some improvements and compromises. Instead, it was left to the protesters who were kept miles away at the bottom of the hill.

 urlLink Troops in Iraq face pay cut / Pentagon says tough duty bonuses are budget-buster  
The Pentagon wants to cut the pay of its 148,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, who are already contending with guerrilla-style attacks, homesickness and 120- degree-plus heat. 

Unless Congress and President Bush take quick action when Congress returns after Labor Day, the uniformed Americans in Iraq and the 9,000 in Afghanistan will lose a pay increase approved last April of $75 a month in "imminent danger pay" and $150 a month in "family separation allowances."   
 urlLink Nude 'David' offends neighbors

        ANOTHER LOST WEEKEND   
Well here it is the end of the weekend and I haven't accomplished a damned thing.  After the week I had I didn't have the energy or inclination to do a single thing.  School started Monday and we were inundated with phone calls from teachers and staff to reset passwords, get printers working and to set up the new teachers.  It was a bear with 3 of us working our butts off and one milking like there's no tomorrow.  We answered a record number of calls and I am feeling the exhaustion.  I am sure the kids are too.   urlLink Valley kids  had to  brave heat, and the start of class.  Valley youngsters returning to school spent the day wiping beads of sweat from their foreheads and making do with scorching water from campus drinking fountains.  urlLink Record temperatures hit the Valley . The mercury reached 116 degrees Sunday, breaking the prior record of 115 for the day set in 1933, a National Weather Service spokesman said. 
     Sunday also tied the record for the hottest day it has ever been in the month of August. Temperatures also reached 116 in August in 1972 and 1975.  At least we didn't have the problems the East Coast had.  We were comfy in our air conditioning as  urlLink a major power outage hits New York, other large cities.   Those poor people.  Funny how the press didn't mock them like they did the  urlLink French  during their heat wave.  What bastards.  But it was the kind of weather that made you want to go get a  urlLink  tall iced cappuccino  despite the conundrum and excruciating tension of Starbucks.  
Time for some rants........  
  ARIZONA RANTS   
Sick to death (no pun intended) of hearing about  urlLink Ted Williams’ DNA missing After Williams died July 5, 2002, his body was taken by private jet to the company in Scottsdale, Ariz. There, Williams’ body was separated from his head in a procedure called neuroseparation, according to the magazine.  Now, this is just a wrong thing and so damned disrespectful of The Splendid Splinter.    
  BUSH RANTS   
 At least I had solice in knowing that there were  urlLink no dog days of summer for Bush  as sixteen words, 45 minutes,28 days bedevil the pResident.  Couldn't happen to a better guy if you ask me.    
 urlLink Support for Bush on Iraq stabilizes  - thank God. 
The return to a polarized political climate, coming so quickly after a period of relative unity during the height of the fighting in Iraq, foreshadows a contentious reelection campaign for the president. The public mood also carries risks for the president’s Democratic challengers, who are attempting to appeal to the strong anti-Bush sentiment within their party without jeopardizing the need to attract independent and swing voters in next year’s general election.  
Good news is that the  urlLink Kentucky Gubernatorial Race Is Test for Bush on Economy  : With scathing attacks on the White House , the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, has turned Kentucky, which has voted with the winner in every presidential election since 1964, into a closely watched bellwether of the 2004 presidential campaign, analysts say.   
  AHH-NOLD RANTS   
Living so close to California and the NONSENSE going on out there it's hard to ignore.  But I don't understand how the Republicans can lambast any celebrity who goes against Bush et al yet embrace this "actor" as a breath of fresh air.  He is not a virtuous man. 
 urlLink Schwarzenegger didn't cast a ballot in 5 of past 11 elections   Labeled by polls the early leader in California's recall election, he did not vote in five of the past 11 statewide elections, records revealed Monday.   
 urlLink The World According to Arnold : "Memorable Quotes From Would-Be Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger" - worth a read to find out what a tool he is.  
  DEAN WATCH   
 urlLink From early peaks, candidates can fall  Gary Hart, Phil Gramm, Ross Perot, Bill Bradley. What do they all have in common? They’re all past presidential candidates who once rode high during the campaign but then, according to the media, “peaked too soon.”DOES HOWARD Dean belong in that club? Well, he’s passed the first requirement for membership. He’s become a media darling. That’s what good poll numbers, flashy fund-raising, and covers of newsweeklies will do for you. Now we wait for step two of the initiation rites, when the media writes him off as peaking too soon.  
 urlLink Dean's List  
To beat Bush, just speak the truth ... LOUDLY.   Dean is pushing with all his might to get that pendulum swinging in his favor by offering something no other Democrat has yet to offer: an alternative to the "Republican-Lite" (as Russ Feingold described it) of the Democratic Leadership Council -- which embraces the likes of Joe Lieberman. As I've stated numerous times in this space, and in public forums, nobody likes a bully -- which is what Bush and his backers are. But quivering cowards -- what  urlLink Bartcop.com  calls "pink tutu Democrat[s]" -- are even less appealing.

Saw  urlLink Seabiscuit  last weekend.  EXCELLENT movie.  Nothing like good horse story.  
Today's plans include laundry, light housecleaning, a  urlLink boat drink  and  urlLink working on my tan   
And in closing just let me say - I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO WORK TOMORROW.

        WEEKEND RAMBLINGS   
Damn, it has been one long-ass week.  The daughter was away at urlLink  Band Camp  and the son was working (go figure!).  It's just as well they were busy or out of pocket as I have been worthless.  It has been particularly hellish at work with the new school year starting up on Monday and the Office Staff and Teachers returning this week.  The  urlLink Help Desk  answered a bazillion calls.  Ok, ok.....that's a gross exageration in the same vein as urlLink  "Saddam had nukes"  but it feels like we did that many.  I know that on Wednesday and Thursday I did 61 calls each day.  Weird that I would do the same number 2 days in a row.  I told everyone that if I did 61 calls yesterday then I was going to go to Vegas and put all my money (all $20 of it) on the number 61 at the roulette table.  Alas - I only did 54 calls yesterday.  Of course that is more calls than the  urlLink Milkman  did - he did half the amount of everyone else.   Then he trashes the rest of us to the people who call in.  The urlLink  Milkman  is on my short list.  Anyone who has been or is currently on my short list knows the wrath that incur.  
Don't get me wrong - I love my 2 older  urlLink sisters  but they are both getting divorced and the stories and woes they tell are aging me in dog years.  I will always love and support them because they are my sisters, my blood, but I have to keep the drama all in perspective and not let it affect my life and my marriage which will be 23 years strong on the 30th of this month.  I can listen and give them emotional support but I have to work hard on not letting it consume me.   
I have to keep reminding myself that I am the mother of 2 teenagers.  They are teenagers in every sense of the word.  It's strange to watch them mature and chart their own course.  No longer the babies I held and took care of.  Mick Jagger was right when he sang "what a drag it is getting old".  However, I did have some encouragement when I read an article that said 
 urlLink teens say they get along with parents .  At first I said GET OUT - but the more I think about it the more I think it true with my kids.  They are great and share their lives with us.  I am blessed for that.  
They say that the  urlLink ‘6 degrees’ theory holds true online .  Wild.  I may have to research that and see if it's true.  It would be amazing if it does.

        AUGUST ALREADY   
Here it is August already.  Back to school for the daughter on August 11 and goes to marching band camp next week.  The son takes 3 classes at community college on the 25th.  Work will pick up big time when school starts the 11th, my birthday is the 27th and I want an iQue urlLink  - a PDA that knows where it is .  This would help my directional dyslexia. But I digress, in additon my husband and I celebrate our  urlLink 23rd wedding anniversary  on the 30th.  Busy month and this weekend is merely the calm before the storm.  
 Home Alone.......Almost   
For years my husband would take the kids camping and leave me alone for a weekend to a week.  I used to look forward to this August tradition.  I would seize the moment to clean house and purge the crap from the kids rooms.  It was always a cleansing pre-birthday ritual and it help me hang onto my sanity.  However, in recent years the camping trips have been shorter and I haven't had the time to adequately purge.  
This weekend my husband took the daughter and another of her friend's up north to the cooler climate to camp.  The  urlLink lummox  decided not to go this weekend.  He does have to work today and said he was 'too busy".  We should read this as he didn't want to be away from the girlfriend.  So needless to say this bummed me to zero as it changes my plans to clean.  He stayed home and harshed my buzz and sucked up all my oxygen. 
However, I got home from work on Friday and since I was still fired up about the slacking and milking action of a co-worker; I ignored the teenagers in my living room watching tv and went to my room and cleaned out my closet and dresser drawers.  I bagged up 5 lawn size trash bags of unused/unwanted clothes.  I took them to the charity drop off right away as well.  I have decided that I really need a  urlLink closet organizer  for the what are now the few shoes and clothes I have.  It felt good to get something accomplished.  I finished up right as the teenagers left and then I went to town on the  urlLink mini blinds  in my  urlLink kitchen  which were heinous.  By the time I finished that gig I was exhausted and went to bed and slept the deep sleep of the EXHAUSTED. 
Yesterday I got up and had my way with the rest of the house and did laundry - even the curtains.  I was an obsessed woman for sure.  I used my new  urlLink Swiffer Wetjet  on the floor and scrubbed the whole house with  urlLink Orange Glo .  Much to the urlLink  hounds  chagrin I used  urlLink Febreeze  on the furniture and carpet deodorizer on the carpet.  It no longer has their whiffage and they are bummed.  Too bad.  I won't even talk about the amount of dog hair that I vacuumed up out of this house.  I swear, they are only there to make hair!! 
After that I cleaned myself up and ordered  urlLink pizza  for the teenagers who had come BACK to suck up my oxygen.  We ate and by 9 p.m. they were gone as quickly as they had appeared.  I then had a pleasant evening alone in my clean house.  
Today's plan involve not much more than  urlLink sunbathing  with a float in the pool and a blender of  urlLink piña coladas  and some  urlLink reggae  music blaring.  Ahhhh, the life of leasure until the troops return home this evening.  
  DEAN WATCH   
Even though my Dean yard sign fell down during the monsoon it will be going back up and I am still keeping an eye on him.  
 urlLink The Left’s Mr. Right? 
IN YOUR FACE: His willingness to go after Bush on Iraq thrilled long-suffering liberals. And his unexpected success at fund-raising gave him crucial momentum. But is Howard Dean the Democrats’ path back to power—or a recipe for another 49-state defeat?

 urlLink Dressed to kill   
 Why are Liberia’s young soldiers decked out in fright wigs and feather boas?  
According to the soldiers themselves, cross-dressing is a military mind game, a tactic that instills fear in their rivals. It also makes the soldiers feel more invincible. This belief is founded on a regional superstition which holds that soldiers can “confuse the enemy’s bullets” by assuming two identities simultaneously. Though the accoutrements and garb look bizarre to Western eyes, they are, in a sense, variations on the camouflage uniforms and face paint American soldiers use to bolster their sense of invisibility (and, therefore, immunity) during combat. Since flak jackets or infrared goggles aren’t available to the destitute Liberian fighters, they opt for evening gowns and frilly blouses.

        WHAT A DIFFERENCE A WEEK MAKES   
I am amazed at how much has changed in my little life in the past week.  I leave for 5 days and come home to find my house cleaned by my husband, my son actually narrowing career choices down from several hundred to a handfull and my daughter maturing into a young woman before my eyes.  My  urlLink bassets  are getting along with the  urlLink Cleo the Cat  and my muscles are weak and flabby from taking a week off from not  urlLink exercising .  I still wouldn't trade my vacation for the world.  
However you have to love the fallout this week from  Robert Novak's article  urlLink "Mission to Niger" . The  urlLink  FBI will probe the White House over the CIA leak  and it will be interesting to see just  urlLink how damaging a leak  it will be for the pResident.  I think it's going to be  substantial- they are already calling it "Revenge-gate" and FINALLY  urlLink Democrats are seeking an independent investigation into  the leak .  Perhaps the best thing to come out of thise HEINOUS breach of trust is that  urlLink doubt grows over prewar intelligence .  For those who feel that the lies don't matter they should look at  urlLink President Bush's "Bring Them On" Picture Album   
  Quote of the Day  

"I'm a doctor.  I believe if you have a theory and a fact comes along that disproves the theory, you throw out the theory.  Republicans believe if a fact comes along that disproves your theory, you throw out the fact."

        "THAT'S RIGHT - YOU'RE NOT FROM TEXAS  
 urlLink but Texas wants you anyway"  - L.Lovett  
Back from a wonderful vacation in  urlLink Austin  .  The weather was lovely, the company of my sisters and cousin were awesome and we all had a great time.  If you are going to live in  urlLink Texas  then Austin in the ONLY place to live.  Sure, there were some redneck elements what with the  urlLink University of Texas  playing that weekend - but otherwise the town is funky, cool and very artsy.  It was a blast!  
My oldest sister and I flew out of here Wednesday evening arriving late in Austin.  My cousin had gotten there earlier in the evening from New Hampshire.  We stayed up until the wee hours visiting and catching up.  It was a great start to our  urlLink Ya-Ya  weekend.  
We got up Thursday morning and went to get manicures and pedicures.  It was a hilarious sight to see all 4 of us lined up getting our toenails and fingernails painted.  We got a case of the giggles which amused the salon workers to no end.  After that we did a little  urlLink Target  shopping for essentials like a new coffeemaker for my sister who lives in Austin but couldn't find her coffeemaker.  This was wrong and we all knew it.  After the shopping trip we then went down to  urlLink Threadgill's 
where I got to have the chicken fried steak I was dreaming of.  It sure hit the spot.  We then went back to my sister's house and watched  urlLink Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood  and layed low and got ready for a night on the town.  We went down to the Sixth Street area in Austin where there is a happening music scene.  It was jumpin' for a Thursday night and we started out at  urlLink Pete's Dueling Piano Bar   which was a hoot - lots of drunk Texans and sing-a-longs with the 2 pianos.  We then ambled down to the  urlLink 311 Club  where we saw a terrific 3 man rythym and blues band.  They did a lot of Texas blues, Motown and we danced like fools. We went back to my sister's house after that and stayed up talking into the wee hours again.  
Friday morning we got up and went for a walk with the dogs in the glorious rain!!!  It was a treat for us Zonies and my curly hair went into  urlLink dreadlocks  from the humidity.  ya-mon - I loved it and the dogs thought they had died and gone to heaven having 4 women walk them.  We then went back and visited and took naps before we got ready to go out.  We went to dinner at  urlLink Trudy's North Star  and I had a margarita and a  urlLink Chile Relleno  that couldn't be beat.  We then drove to see my nephew play with the  urlLink Anderson High School Trojan Band .  We went home after the game exhausted but had a terrific time.  Again - for 4 women too exhausted to go out we stayed up talking until the wee hours again.   
Saturday we went down to  urlLink Old Pecan Street Arts Festival  .  We stopped on the way there at  urlLink Opal Divine's   for lunch and then went down to the  urlLink Festival .  There was a lot of arts & crafts stuff and plenty of live music to boot.  We listened to a good zydeco band -  urlLink Dr Zog   and had a great time just watching the people of Austin.  It did my heart good to see many Dean supporters in t-shirts at the festival and someone had spray painted on the sidewalks with stencil "your president lied" - all of this in Bush's home state.  I was delightfully happy.  Anyhoo, after the festival we were tired and we hung out at my sister's house and sang karaoke with the little player she got for her birthday.  In honor of her impending divorce we had her singing  urlLink I Will Survive  and other empowering songs while we laughed and talked once again into the wee hours of the night.    
Sunday we packed and got ready to leave.  We got to the airport and had our tearful good-byes and promised that we would make this an annual event.  We cried and hugged and waved goodbye to my sister from the curb.  My other sister, cousin and I then went into the airport and I had a bbq brisket sandwich from  urlLink The Salt Lick Barbecue Restaurant  there in the airport.  We said goodbye to my cousin and got on our plane back to hot Phoenix.  It was good to be home and I feel rejuvinated and ready to deal with my family/coworkers/life after my ya-ya weekend.    
  POLITICAL RANTS   
 urlLink Independent probe of leak urged  
Charging that the Bush administration cannot credibly investigate itself, Democrats are calling for an independent probe of accusations that senior White House officials revealed the identity of a CIA agent to syndicated columnist Robert Novak in violation of a federal law barring identification of covert operatives. Meanwhile, the husband of the agent whose name was made public, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV, leveled the finger of suspicion at White House political adviser Karl Rove, telling MSNBC TV on Monday, “My sources tell me that at a minimum Mr. Rove condoned it.” 
 urlLink Iraq, 9/11 still linked by Cheney  
Vice President Cheney has continued to suggest that an Iraqi intelligence agent met with a Sept. 11, 2001, hijacker five months before the attacks, even as the story was falling apart under scrutiny by the FBI, CIA and the foreign government that first made the allegation. 
 urlLink Free Pass for the President  
Until now George W. Bush has been uncommonly lucky. He has managed to turn a budget surplus into the most monumental deficit in history, in part because of ill-conceived tax cuts. He mounted a war in Iraq with the promise of weapons of mass destruction that have never materialized. He went after two sworn enemies, Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, and has managed to apprehend neither despite the most expensive intelligence-gathering apparatus on earth. He used Saddam and Al Qaeda in the same sentence in his State of the Union address, then had to confess that his innuendo had false underpinnings. He traveled the other day to the United Nations to ask for help from a body whose members he treated with utter, unilateral contempt not long ago.
        To truly appreciate what a free pass the president has gotten, it is necessary only to imagine what the response from Republicans—and reporters—would have been if Bill Clinton had been responsible for one of those things, much less all of them.

        A FEW RANTS BEFORE I LEAVE   
As I prepare to depart Phoenix for Austin I have a few passing rants.    Even though  urlLink Clark's entry is reshaping the 2004 race  I have vowed to continue to support Dean.  However, I have also taken  urlLink The Pledge  and urge all Democrats to do the same.  We have a common enemy and his name is Bush.  Let's not lose sight of that.   
However, it makes my heart soar to hear  urlLink Dean assail Bush and the Republican Right   Dean reminded a raucous crowd that Bostonians of an earlier time rebelled against tyranny and argued that the today's political environment demands a similar response. 
"They had a king named George who had forgotten his people and only listened to special interest," he said. The extreme right wing has shown nothing but contempt for democracy," Dean said. Pointing to a flag on the platform, he said, "This flag does not belong to Rush Limbaugh, Jerry Falwell, John Ashcroft , Tom DeLay and Dick Cheney . This flag belongs to us and we want our country." Dean recalled the founders who outlined the vision for the nation's Constitution. "But at every turn," Dean said, "the Bush administration has turned the Constitution on its head." He said the administration has divided the country "by race, gender, income, religion and sexual orientation." And he said Bush and his team "have capitalized on domestic fears of terrorism for political gain."

        TOO OLD TO ROCK N' ROLL - TOO YOUNG TO DIE  
Ok, I got a miserable  urlLink hang over .  I have no one to blame but myself.  It's the result of 4 - count 'em - 4  urlLink Cosmopolitans  at the  urlLink Amsterdam Bar  after the  urlLink Zoni Awards .  I am sorry to report that the husband didn't win but several of our friends did.  It was fun, we were dressed to the 9's and it was worth it to see the drunken gay men try to pick up on my husband.  Of course, my state is not conducive to wanting to answer phones today and hear people whine about their computers.  Ah well, such is life.  I only have to get through today and tomorrow then have my vacation.  Good thing.  I guess I can't blame my age for not knowing that much alcohol would give me a raging hangover as they are now saying that  urlLink Menopause is not tied to forgetfulness .  There goes a perfectly good excuse - dammit.    The one shining spot in my otherwise foggy morning was reading that  urlLink Gen. Wes Clark is tied with pResident Bush in poll .

        GENERAL MONDAY MALAISE   
Had quite a weekend.  Argued with the husband Friday after being left home alone with NO phone call until almost 9 p.m.  The daughter was  urlLink marching  at the football game, the son was at  urlLink the theatre  for work and I was home with the  urlLink bassets  and the cat.  I felt pitiful and middle-aged sitting there all by myself on a Friday night waiting for a phone call like some distressed debutante. When the husand arrived home he walked into a hornet's nest.  Poor sap.  I went to bed after I had exhausted myself reaming him.    
The husband then further messed with his heartbeat by waking me up at 5 a.m. on Sat. I got up with a pinched muscle or SOMETHING in the chest - had mondo chest pains.  So I did the  urlLink Salute to the Sun  and loosened myself up the proceeded to clean the bejesus out of my FILTHY  urlLink kitchen .  When I finished that the husband was awake and I reamed him yet again then took a nap.  It was a grand nap.  
When I got up from the nap the husband was trying his damnest to make nice and suggested that the daughter and we go to  urlLink Souper Salad  for dinner then go see  urlLink Matchstick Men  while the daughter and a friend went to a simultaneous showing of  urlLink Secondhand Lions .  It was a splendid idea and we all enjoyed our respective movies.  The daughter and her friend liked theirs for the Haley Joel Osmont teen hunk factor while I like our movie for the Nick Cage factor.  The husband was just damned glad to get the heat off of him for a change.  
Sunday consisted of a major  urlLink Costco  run where there was plenty of free samples which makes the trip worthwhile.  We grazed and shopped our way through there.  I was slightly manic and pleased that we were able to find the  urlLink Margaritaville Shrimp  I had been dreaming about. We had that for dinner and it was delicious.  However, we did have to stop at the "non-bulk" grocery store for soda and cat food.  It made me realize that  urlLink  owning a cat really is madness .  The irony there is that it's not even really my cat!!!  
Tonight is going to suck as I have to get all  urlLink CHI-CHI   for the annual trek to the 
 urlLink AriZoni Awards  where the husband is up for Best Stage Design for Contract Theatre.  He won last year and I sure hope he wins again this year or my having to put on a formal will be for naught.  
Getting excited for my trip to  urlLink Austin   for my sister's  urlLink 50th birthday .  My oldest sister and I are flying out Wed. after work and my cousin is flying in from New Hampshire earlier in the evening on Wed.   We will be there through Sunday and will see the nephew march in the  urlLink band  at the football game -I can't wait!!!!  High school football is an obsession in Texas.  We will have a grand time yakking and having a "girl's weekend" which we all so desperately need what with divorces, kids, dogs, cats and husbands driving us crazy.  It will be a grand time for sure!!!.  We are all stoked to go to Texas and eat at  urlLink Threadgill's,   have some cocktails and  go out and hear some good Texas style 
 urlLink music  .   
  TEXAS-SIZE POLITICAL RANTS    
I love how the tide is turning and the  urlLink White House is ambushed by criticism from America's military community .  Add that to how pResident  urlLink Bush responds to Kennedy's criticism of Iraq policies   and describes it as "uncivil".  What a whiner!  All  Sen.  Kennedy said last week was that the case for going to war against Iraq was a fraud "made up in Texas" to give Republicans a political boost. He also alleged that the money for the war is being used to bribe foreign leaders to send troops.  I guess that hurt the usurper's feelings.  WAH.  However, even though he's going to ask for the U.N. to help ol'  urlLink Bush won't offer Iraq concessions .  There's a smart move and a way to win friends and influence nations.  Dolt.  He ought to stick to what he does  urlLink best    
  DEAN WATCH   
 urlLink Kerry, Dean in N.H. showdown  
Democratic presidential front-runner Howard Dean and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry are squaring off in an increasingly bruising battle to win the Jan. 27 New Hampshire primary, which would give one of them a big, perhaps decisive, boost toward becoming the Democratic nominee.  
 urlLink Dean is driven by the grass roots  
“It’s just extraordinary,” said Dick Morris, a political consultant who advised Bill Clinton. “It’s part of a new era — back to basics. Howard Dean is using the Internet in an entirely guerrilla marketing approach. By this process, he’s developed a massive grass-roots list. It’s active and participatory, and people feel engaged. ... You’re brought in by friends and family. It’s bottom-up, and people love that; they feel empowered.” Dean campaign manager Joe Trippi said that anecdotal evidence suggests Dean’s supporters are a mixed bag of the party’s liberal base, reinvigorated Democrats who had either dropped out of the process or were never engaged and political independents who supported Ross Perot in 1992 and favored Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in 2000. Trippi said he believes they will go to the polls for Dean.

        FEAR AND LOATHING IN PHOENIX   
Home from work and having myself a doozy of a  urlLink Panic Attack  .  Haven't had one like this in a long while.  Had to take an extra  urlLink  XANAX® .  Not sure what set me off - I often don't know.  I think it might have had something to do with the near miss on the way home.  Since I live near a retirement home there is a large number of  urlLink Phantom Cars .  Usually they are benign - just a pair of gnarled fingers and a tuft of gray hair behind the wheel of some late-model Buick.  However, today I almost had one hit me on the way home.  I had the a/c off in the  urlLink  Cruiser   and this one came so close to t-boning me that I could smell the Ben-Gay on the arthritic hands.  Just add that to the list of reasons why I hate to drive - even in the cool car.  I had visions of an accident that would total my first new car in 17 years.  Luckily the old man/woman(???) got control of the Buick before it careened into me.  I have been amping my guts out ever since.  I am not blaming the geezer for all of it though - it could be the iron taxi-schedule I have with the daughter and my upcoming flight to Texas to see me sister.  Who know?  That's the deal with these attacks - they come out of the blue.  Hopefully the meds will kick in soon.  
Luckily the trip to the vet went well yesterday.  The cat was spayed in the nick of time as Dr. Tracey said that lil' Cleo was in the early stages of heat.  Dodged that bullet.  The bassets were fabulous and rode well in the car and tried their best to keep the drooling to a minimun.  I do have some slobber marks in the car though.  They were very good for their exam, shots and nail clipping.  However, it was a little too much excitement for one of them as there was dog-urp in the backseat when we got home.  The cat is laying low and taking it easy - I feel her pain.  I had the same surgery in November and know that all she wants to do now is sleep and read books.  
  MINOR WEATHER OBSESSION   
All the coverage of the hurricane has me longing for the sea.  It would be so awesome to see the power of the weather and the sea.  Someday I hope to.  What I do find wild is that  urlLink more than a million customers are without power  as a reult of Izzy.   urlLink Hurricane Isabel Pounded the East Coast  spreading rain across North Carolina and Virginia and into Maryland, Delaware and parts of West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The federal government shut down in Washington.  That proves some good can come from this storm.

        RANDOM THOUGHTS   
Ahhh, Autumn is in the air here in Phoenix with the mornings being cool and lovely and the daytime temp's only going into the high-90's.  Makes us Zonies want to break out the cider and decorate for Halloween.  I do miss seeing the fall foliage we saw in Colorado at this time of year and the opportunity to wear jeans without threat of chaffe.  However, I do not miss the white stuff.  
The cat gets spayed today.  Hoorah!!!!  She's been begging for it.  She got taken in to see Dr. Tracey this morning and we will pick her up this afternoon.  The kids and I will take the bassets in at 5 for their annual shots and then we shall have the ride from hell home.  I am thinking that we need to take the obie-wand to smack the hounds and keep them in line while we have the yowlie-cat in the crate in the back of my Cruiser.  Should be a real flying circus.    
In a show of America's good - albeit delayed and morbid - good taste - the urlLink last albums by Zevon, Cash fly off shelves . Nothing like death to make us realize what we had and how much we'll miss them.

  POLITICAL RANTS   
Finally,  urlLink  House Democrats call on Bush to fire advisers on Iraq  .  A little too little too late I am afraid.  Meanwhile, BIG TIME Dick Cheney calls the  urlLink   Halliburton questions 'a political cheap shot' .   So what's an oil man to do?  Well, fire up the rhetoric and start alleging that  urlLink Syria Is Seeking Banned Arms   That's a good diversion - fire up that war on "terrah".  
  DEAN/CLARK WATCH   
And so  urlLink the race is on for the un-Dean .  He has a lot of appeal, and potential, but his main attraction is he can be a cowboy like Bush, but can work with the world.   urlLink Sizing up the Wesley Clark effect  it seems he will be a formidable candidate who will have a serious impact on the race, even if he doesn’t win.  He will be known as the  urlLink Foreign Policy Candidate  
and unless Clark can turn his expertise into aggressively naked politics, he may never be heard at all.  I like Clark, but would prefer to see him as Dean's running mate in November of 2004.

I also have lots of  urlLink Hemingway  that is 200 pages or so but since I like Hemingway he's not interested.  The kid is a maroon - he writes beautifully but reading is torture for him.

And, so, here we are. Two years has passed since a terrorist act on US soil left more than three thousand people dead; US citizens and citizens from dozens of other nations.And during those two years, we - and the world - have waited for a full and factual investigation by the Bush Administration, on whose watch this horrific crime occurred. 

We continue to wait. 

Not only has the Bush Administration failed to conduct an official inquiry into this massacre, it has also attempted - successfully, so far - to impede, delay and ultimately halt any attempt to unravel the awful truths of September 11, 2001.   
 urlLink Ashcroft booed at meeting
  
With fists and middle fingers upraised, a booing, hissing and chanting crowd of about 1,200 people awaited United States Attorney General John Ashcroft when he arrived at Faneuil Hall at Boston University Tuesday morning, decrying his support of what some protesters called government policies undermining civil rights.

Ashcroft was bombarded by cries of "Shame!" and the sound of the "Imperial Death March" from the movie "Star Wars" as he entered a meeting with law enforcement officials in Faneuil Hall.  
 urlLink Foreign Views of U.S. Darken Since Sept. 11  
In the two years since Sept. 11, 2001, the view of the United States as a victim of terrorism that deserved the world's sympathy and support has given way to a widespread vision of America as an imperial power that has defied world opinion through unjustified and unilateral use of military force.

 urlLink Clark reportedly asked to join Dean  
Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean has asked retired Army general Wesley Clark to join his campaign, if the former NATO commander does not jump into the race himself next week, and the two men discussed the vice presidency at a weekend meeting in California, sources familiar with the discussions said.  While it would represent a gamble for both men to team up so early in the campaign, such a move would rattle an already unpredictable nomination campaign. Dean and Clark have two things in common that if combined could prove formidable among Democratic voters: They both opposed the war in Iraq, and both are generating excitement on the Internet and with grass-roots activists.
       But a Dean-Clark alliance would also underscore the relative inexperience that both men have in national campaigns.  However, now the reports are that  urlLink Clark rules out vice presidential bid for now . In the meantime  urlLink Dean takes fire but stays out front.   That must be the reason  urlLink fellow Democrats pile on Dean  - even comparing him to Newt Gingrich!!!!  They have gotten desperate.

 urlLink Democrats clash in 2nd fall debate  
SEN. JOSEPH LIEBERMAN accused former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean of turning his back on Israel, and the Democratic presidential front-runner shot back that he and former President Bill Clinton held the same view on the issue.
       “It doesn’t help...to demagogue this issue,” Dean quickly added in the sharpest clash of the young Democratic debate season.  
 urlLink There’s a Chill in the Air  
Dean has risen through shrewd use of the Net and opposition to an increasingly unpopular war in Iraq. But he and his advisers rightly think his best sales point is his image as an antipolitical politician, a country doctor turned governor who boasts of “my directness and my unwillingness to bend” as he bluntly diagnoses all the ills of American life. But the record is more complicated than that, of course, especially as Dean moves from grass-roots obscurity on the Democratic left to a leading contender.  His critics say that the good doctor can bend it like Beckham when he has to.

        POLITICAL RANTS N' RAVES   
As I sit here getting ready to go to my District 11 Democrats meeting I have a few rants and raves.  I am excited about tonight's meeting as there will be representatives from most of the Democratic Presidential Candidates there to give us information.  This will be a good oppurtunity to stock up on some Dean buttons, placards and stickers.  The weather here in Phoenix is windy and stormy and I can't help but feel it's the winds of change........  
Now onto the rants: 
 urlLink Democrats demand details on Iraq  
IT SURE SMELLS LIKE VIETNAM 
       On the Senate floor Monday, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said there isn’t enough money to meet Bush’s own education goals, “and yet we’re going to ask the American taxpayers to keep coughing up money for this quagmire that we’re in now in Iraq. This may not be Vietnam, but boy, it sure smells like it,” he said. “And every time I see these bills coming down for the money, it’s costing like Vietnam, too.”  
 urlLink Britain warned US to expect September 11 al-Qaeda hijackings

"I think this is the fourth attempt to undermine democracy in this country by the right wing of the Republican Party since the 2000 elections," said Dean. 

Other examples, he said, were the refusal by the "conservative-dominated United States Supreme Court" to order a recount of the votes in Florida during the 2000 presidential election and separate GOP-led redistricting efforts in Colorado and Texas that could result in a loss of seats currently held by Democrats.

        POLITICAL RANTS   
 urlLink Bush’s address to the American people  last night really got me going.  It was approximately 15 minutes long and consisted of 2260 words all adding up to $87 billion needed for further exploitation of Iraq's oil for the betterment of America.  Along the way Bush mangled his way through the speech and the tally of words used is as follows:  
Iraq/Iraqi = 45 
War on Terrah/Terrah/Terrah-ism/Terrah-ists = 28 
Free/Freedom (but not Freedom Fries) = 16 
Aghganistan/Aghgani (but not Aghgan Hound) = 9 
Tyrant/Dictator (but not himself) = 6 
Saddam = 5 
September 11 = 4 
Coalition = 3 
Al-Qaida = 3 
Regime (said nastily)= 3 
WMD = 1 
Osama (remember Osama?  this was a war about Osama....) = 0  
The whole thing frosted me.  I think was got me even more riled than the speech was  having  urlLink Sen. Joe Biden  give the Democratic viewpoint.   Democrat MY ASS - Biden's nose is so far up Bush's butt he hasn't smelled air since Usurption Day.  It's time for that man to either change his party or quit since he is NOT earning his money.   
Luckily,  urlLink Bush request fires up critics, advisers  and a domestic battle was being fought Monday over those billions and the bigger policy picture. Democratic presidential hopefuls poured criticism on the president, while Bush’s advisers defended his request, which would come on top of the $79 billion approved in April for the initial costs of the war and its aftermath and for worldwide efforts against "terrah-ism".  
 urlLink Time for a New Patriotism?   “Go ahead, make ads wearing that flight suit on the aircraft carrier; visit Ground Zero with a bullhorn during the GOP convention next year in New York; try to ‘Dukakisize’ the Democratic nominee as an unpatriotic weenie. This time, it ain’t working.” And, by the way, “We told you so on the failure of your go-it-alone arrogance abroad and your job-killing, feed-the-rich economy at home.”   
I finally got to watch the Democratic Candidate Debate that was NOT aired in Phoenix on Thursday.  NO, it was aired later on C-Span and I was able to catch it on Sunday.  What slayed me was how  urlLink Lieberman opens anti-Dean offensive  warning that “the Bush recession would be followed by the Dean Depression”.  He's got some nerve.  In fact, all of the Senators/Representative (with the sole exception of Kuchinich) have their nerve criticizing the pResident when they are the ones who voted for EVERY SINGLE THING THE MAN ASKED FOR!!!

        PARENTAL RANTS N' RAVES   
My son was in a car accident yesterday afternoon.  Neither he nor his girlfriend who was riding in the car were hurt - thank God.   The guy he hit was hurt as was his Ford Focus.  It was mangled.  (*note to self - never buy a Ford Focus) My poor son is despondent as this is the Bronco II my parents just bought for him from my brother.   He has had it for less than a week.   Now it's undriveable.  I shudder to think what the insurance premium will look like now.   I am glad we didn't sell the old Toyota Tercel 4WD Of Hell as he is back to driving that POS.  It breaks my heart to see him so disappointed but yet I am so damned angry with him at the same time.   Parenting is a bitch.  
Of course, I then read this article about  urlLink Cultural references for 18-year-olds  and realize that I am working beyond my capacity here.   It's a good thing I had the gray in my hair covered up or I would look older than I feel.

CAMPAIGN 2004 already has been an amazing show, and it hasn’t even started.

An obscurity a few months ago, he is the frontrunner now, and everyone knows it.

        A WITTLE WEST AND WEWAXATION   
Well, the weekend was sublime.  My long weekend started with no work on Wednesday the 27th - my birthday.  I saw the troops off and then did a power workout.  I suspect it had something to do with me being middle-aged crazy.  After the workout I hosed myself down and took myself to  urlLink Elements Salon  and got my skanky blonde highlights removed.  Had a wonderful hair color experience where my stylist, Manuela, took my hair back to it's original dark brown color.  She said it was the  urlLink Redken  color that "thinks it's a conditioner" so she applied the goo and had me sit under the dryer to let it soak in while I drank iced tea and had the foot massager on.  It was GLORIOUS.  When it was all over with I tried not to act SHOCKED and AWED at the $80 price tag for the new coif.  I was determined not to look like the rube I am so I whipped out my credit card and put it on that fabulous piece of plastic along with a generous $5 tip to Manuela.  I have NEVER in my life spent that much money on my dome but figured it was my 45th birthday and I was long overdue.  I promptly went home after the coiffure and took a long and lovely birthday nap.   
 When I awoke the family was there and ready to take me to  urlLink Applebee's  for dinner where I had the delicious  urlLink Garlic-Crusted Shrimp Caesar Salad .   I also had a grande margarita as well.  It hit the spot.  Then we went home where I opened my gifts of some  urlLink Coconut Lime Verbena  candles for our romantic weekend, a  urlLink Coca Cola Tiffany Phone  that looks awesome in my  urlLink  Coke kitchen  and a coupon for a manicure and pedicure.  Then they brought out a Key Lime Pie from  urlLink Costco  that was bigger than our collective heads - THAT hit the spot for sure.  It was a grand birthday and I felt extremely special.  
Then on Thursday we got the kids to school and did some troubleshooting of car problems for the son (what else is new eh?) and packed up for our romantic getaway.  I ran down to the mall and got my manicure and pedicure which was marvelous and so self-indulgent.  The husband and I finally  left the house at 4 p.m. after getting the kids squared away and we got to the  urlLink Radisson  around 5.  We settled in our room which was located away from the main pool and very secluded.   We did a tour of the resort and spa then ran to the store to get some minor provisions of snacks, wine and such.  We then went to eat at  urlLink Sweet Tomatoes  and then went back to the resort for a late-night dip in the hot tub and did some laps in the pool since we were the only ones out there.    
On Friday I awoke early and went to the  urlLink Mist Spa  there at the resort and took the 9 a.m.  urlLink yoga  class.  It was great and got me in the mood to work out.  The husband joined me at 10 and we went to the fitness room and worked out on the cycles, did the free weights and the other weight equipment for an hour.  After that we both went to our respective gender sides of the spa and did a  urlLink dry sauna , then a  urlLink steam sauna  and followed it by a relaxing whirlpool soak.  It sure felt good after the 2 hours of exercise.  We then met in the common area and drank our weight in the delicious tropical iced tea there before heading back to our room and spent some time talking - just us. We didn't discuss kids, work or politics - it was wonderful.  After that we went to the pool for the rest of the afternoon and did  some sunning, swimming and sopping up of piña coladas.    
That evening we got dressed up and went to dinner at  urlLink Red Lobster.   We then raced out to try and catch the  urlLink Showstoppers  at Arizona Casino.  Unfortunately it was sold out.  Go figure.  So we ambled around the casino and I blew $20 on slots and the husband tried his hand at video blackjack since the tables were PACKED.  While we were checking out the blackjack tables who did I spot but  urlLink Superintendent Tom Reale  dropping big time bucks at the high dollar table.  Needless to say this weirded me out and we left pronto before he recognized "Help Desk Heather".  We went back to our room and found that there was a leak somewhere which made our carpet wet but decided against calling the desk to report it until morning.  
Got up the next morning with the flood worse so we called the front desk and they sent a repairman who determined the water heater broke so we were moved to an "upgraded" room poolside.   It was a bigger room but not as secluded as our other room and had more noise of kids in the pool.  We figured it was only for one more night so what the hell.  After we moved we went back to the spa and did a  urlLink water aerobics  class then the weight room, saunas and whirlpools again.  I also took the opportunity to use the spa bath products and slather myself down with green tea lotion and go out into the  urlLink  zen rock garden  and do some meditation.  As I was there meditating it made me realize how relaxing our weekend had been without external distractions and that our shoulders did indeed rest below our earlobes for the first time in months.  It was a sublime revelation.  After the mediation we drank more tea then retired to our room for the afternoon.  
That evening we went out for our anniversary to  urlLink The 5 and Diner  for dinner which was very reminiscant of our honeymoon 23 years prior where we ate at  urlLink Bob's Big Boy  in Flagstaff, AZ.  We had excellent sandwiches and hadn't realized how hungry we were.  We then went to  urlLink  The Longshot Bar and Grill   to see the  urlLink Azz Izz Band  play.  The band was thrilled to see us and made a big deal of announcing our anniversary - one of 3 other couples in the place celebrating.  We have been going to see them for over 10 years now and they always are so nice to us and let us dance our geezerly butts off.  We stayed there until they were done playing then we went back to our room.  
Woke up sore from dancing but relaxed still.  We packed leisurely and checked out then went to  urlLink The Good Egg  for a brunch of Eggs Benedict.  We then took our time getting home where the kids, dogs and cat were all thrilled to see us.   We unpacked and were still in such a state of thorough relaxation that we both promptly took naps.  The kids then went out that evening leaving us to our own devices so it was like the weekend was extended a bit.  
Yesterday, Labor Day, was another lazy day of laundry and napping.  I talke to my sister and set up the trip we are taking later this month to see our other sister in Austin, TX on her 50th birthday.  That will be very exciting - a cousin from New Hampshire is even flying in for it!! It will be a real Ya-Ya Weekend.  The rest of the day was spent with the kids and my husband and myself lounging around.  We all agreed that we didn't want to go back to work or school.  However, reality set in around 10 p.m. and we all went to bed to prepare ourselves for the week ahead.  
In retrospect, it was so nice not to have anything to rant or rave about.  I am sure this relaxed state can't continue forever - and that's a shame.

        HAPPY HALLOWEEN  
Up late last night carving  urlLink pumpkins  and getting the kids (the husband is included in this classification) ready for tonight's festivities.  Saw that the hubby's alien head idea morphed into a complete alien BODY and head costume complete with spine, intestines and flesh colored paint.  (Those pictures will be posted at another time.)  He's going to scare the living daylights out of the kids.  Truly - it's a gruesome sight - 6'6" of nasty foam alien.   Suffice to say I will be glad to get out of the house and go to the football game, watch the daughter march in the band and leave the "men" in charge of Halloween this year.  I just hope I have a house to return to when the night is over.

 urlLink U.S. Rejected Davis on Aid to Clear Trees : "The Bush administration took six months to evaluate Gov. Gray Davis' emergency request last spring for $430 million to clear dead trees from fire-prone areas of Southern California.
The request was finally denied Oct. 24, only hours before wildfires roared out of control in what has become the largest fire disaster in California history."  
 urlLink Private Firms Do U.S. Military's Work
 : "By paying civilians to handle military tasks, the Bush administration is freeing up U.S. troops to fight. But the use of contractors also hides the true costs of war.
Their dead aren't added to official body counts. Their duties - and profits - are hidden by close-mouthed executives who won't give details to Congress"

        BOO BABY!   
 urlLink The History and Customs of Halloween  vary from country to country, state to state and even family to family.  In our household  urlLink Halloween   is celebrated with a vengence.  The husband goes all out and last night he was up until the wee hours constructing a HUGE  urlLink alien head  out of a balloon and spray foam.  This looks to beat out the  urlLink voodoo  theme (complete with a dozen foam  urlLink shrunken heads ) of last year, the  urlLink radioactive  theme of 2 years ago which almost resulted in my kitchen being burnt down and even the  urlLink glo-in-the-dark  masks and blacklight fest of 3 years ago that scared the bejesus out of the neighborhood children.  What used to be a fun holiday of a few  urlLink pumpkins , some rubber bats and major amounts of  urlLink candy  has now been turned into a major suburban theatrical extravaganza.  We have people drive up to see our house which is easy to spot because it has a  urlLink Jacob's Ladder  on the roof as a beacon to all.  I have resigned myself to this and usually stay out of it. I just let the husband be the master  urlLink stagehand  and  urlLink ham  that he is and revel in his child-like joy.   
 I am in charge of the jack-o-lanterns though.  I do a hell of a  urlLink jack-o-lantern  and think that perhaps pumpkin is my medium.  I have several stencils created already and think I will also join in on the  urlLink The Peace Pumpkin Project .  However, my BIG pumpkin will be a  urlLink One-Term President  lantern.   
Speaking of one-term presidents......  
  BUSH RANTS   
 urlLink Poll: Iraq War Drains Confidence in Bush  
In the latest poll, released Tuesday, 40 percent said the war in Iraq has made them less confident of Bush's ability to handle the country's other big problems, while 27 percent said it has made them more confident. Another third, 32 percent, said it hasn't made much difference in their opinions. 
 urlLink 'Mission Accomplished' Whodunit   Six months after he spoke on an aircraft carrier deck under a banner proclaiming "Mission Accomplished," President Bush disavowed any connection with the war message. Later, the White House changed its story and said there was a link.

 urlLink  Howard Dean Defends Record on Minorities   
Dean called himself a "vigorous supporter" of affirmative action and explained the 1995 remark to reporters while in Las Vegas for two private fund-raisers. 
 urlLink Taking Bush head-on, Dean is riding high  
His 'fire in the belly' is drawing fervent support from war critics -- and increasing attacks from his Democratic rivals. 
 urlLink The persistence of Howard Dean  
 Dean is reverting to the very same theme that he started with: Why don’t Democrats stand up and fight President Bush? It is the remarkable consistency of the Dean message that has brought him success. Not only is he relentlessly “on message,” as the consultants say, but his message is what rank-and-file Democrats hunger for.

Dean in AZ  The race for Arizona is close. A statewide poll done this month had former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and retired Gen.

        PERSONAL RANTS AND RAVES   
What a weekend it was.  Went home with what I thought was a headache on Thursday and by nightfall I knew it was not just a headache.  Had to stay home again on Friday as I had the aches and chills and sore throat thing going.  Begs the question - is it a  urlLink cold or flu?   So I slept a lot and layed around the house watching obtuse and artsy movies on the  urlLink The Independent Film Channel .   I was feeling a little better by Saturday so went down to  urlLink Tucson  to watch the daughter's band compete in 

 urlLink BandDay .  It was a grand day and I popped aspirin and sat in the shade while the bands played.  We saw some outstanding bands - especially the  urlLink "Pride of Arizona"  - they were awesome and the high school kids sure were impressed seeing those college students play like there was no tomorrow.  On the way back from Tucson we stopped at  urlLink Cracker Barrel  and I got some turkey soup which helped a lot.  The daughter's band didn't place this time and they have one more festival this weekend to see if they get to go to the State Band Competition.  They are sure working hard and they are excited that the Washington High School football team is high in the division  urlLink football rankings  and will go to the State Playoffs.  That gives them more chances to perform at halftime.  Very exciting.   
However, I had to go visit my parents and do laundry yesterday which didn't allow me a lot of time to rest up so today I still feel like hell.  Got a headache, sore throat and feel just exhausted.  I am going to be early tonight and hope to nip whatever this bad ju-ju is.

Work was weird.  First day with the Milkman officially gone.  Kind of strange not to hear vulgar noises or call-milking coming from his cubicle.  Of course the Deputy was thrilled and moved into the vacated cubicle forthwith.  I just kept the interaction to a minimun and tuned him out.  Had a  urlLink Slim-Fast Dutch Chocolate  meal bar for breakfast with my coffee.  Then at lunch I felt a wild hair and ran back to  urlLink Target  to purchase the  urlLink Bun and Thigh Max .  I had seen the informercial and - much to my chagrin - it looked intriguing and since my ol' pal gravity is working it's magic on my ass I went for the thing.  What the hell eh?  Beats the ehll out of squats.  
 
I got back to work and had a  urlLink Slim-Fast Orange-Pineapple  shake for lunch.  I finished up the afternoon working hard since it was just me n' the Deputy on the phones.  The  urlLink Straw Boss  will be back tomorrow and then it will - hopefully - ease up. 
 
Came on home to discover that the husband is once again - working late.  OF COURSE.  Why should I expect otherwise?  The son goes off to his gal's house to grill up some burgers and have himself a family bbq.  The daughter is off to band rehearsal and I find myself once again home alone and hostile.  I see them all off and the worked the  urlLink "Buttmaster General"  till my legs were shaking and I was calmer.

        PRESONAL RANTS   
Ok, maybe it's because I ran out of my hormones or maybe it's because the husband had to work today or maybe it's just a prelude to  urlLink Empty-nest syndrome .  I have idea but I am in a foul mood today.  Woke up still steamed at the husband for having to  urlLink work  today.  I mean, the dishwasher needs repair and there is something foul going on with the fridge as well.  We got grass up to our ass in the front yard and yet he has to WORK.  This is probably why I am pissed.   Soooooooo, I had to get the daugther down to the school to get her band bus and head out for the  urlLink Canyon Del Oro Band Invitational .  Came home and since it was such a lovely day I decided to take the  urlLink bassets  for a walk.  I leash them up and they are rearing to go.  We head out and get down to  urlLink  Butler Park  with lots of drooling and slobbering and visiting with people along the way.  At the park there are lots of children playing so of course the hounds decide they need to whore it up with them.  Fine - whatever.  After 20 minutes of this I decide it's time to come home.  Uh-uh.  Nope - not happening - I am faced with dueling  urlLink Flat Basset  . It involves the Basset flattening itself onto the ground, often with legs spread out. The dog no longer weighs its original weight, but thousands of pounds and is virtually an immovable. I commence to DRAG them back home.  It's ugly and I am sweating like a mule.  I get to the intersection of 19th and Northern and a family having a yard sale thinks this sight is hilarious and I am sure it was.  At the time I didn't think so.  They take pity on me and "hound-sit" while I run - literally - home to get the car since when I called home there was - of course - no one home.  I get the Cruiser and pick them up and as soon as we pull up into the driveway and I open the car door the Axis of Evil Bassets BOLT down the street!!!  I had to then run - AGAIN -  after them and herd them back home.  I was pissed!!!!  So then the son comes home with his girlfriend wanting to cook eggs here and I proceed to bust his chops and he leaves.  I then go to  urlLink Walgreen's   for my meds and  urlLink  Albertson's  for groceries since I have some Diet Coke, mayo and a tortilla in the house.  I am still sweaty and looking my best.  I am sure I scared the other shoppers.  I get home with a full load of groceries and unload those out of the car and as soon as I shut the car door THAT'S when the son comes out of his room and asks if I need any help. I didn't even know he had come home.  ARGGGGH.  I snapped at him and he then went back to his room.  After this seance I then go and take a nap.  I sure needed it.  Got up and hosed down so that I am  physically  ready to go to  urlLink Phoenix Theatre  to see "Chicago" with the husband tonight - but not emotionally.  Rather have a sharp stick in the eye quite frankly but will have to go and be the dutiful  urlLink trophy wife .  I think it best if the husband keep his interaction with me to a minimum and buy me a few  urlLink Rumthing Specials .  It's going to be a very bumpy night.

Gen Boykin, the general leading the hunt for Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. has repeatedly told Christian groups and prayer meetings that President George W Bush was chosen by God to lead the global fight against Satan.

 urlLink  Democrats' Rallying Cry: Anybody but Bush  
You've got to remember the sense that George Bush didn't win the election to begin with - that the election was stolen in Florida - and that he's taking this country down the wrong path with both foreign and domestic policy, that he's giving away our natural resources to his friends.  Dean is leading in key state polls and fund raising on the strength of his anti-war, anti-establishment message, and the belief that he is standing up to Bush while his Washington-based rivals waver.

        PLAYOFF FEVER  
 urlLink Elimi-NOT! Sox bash back in Bronx  They arrived at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday with a 30 mph wind howling in their faces. And that was somehow fitting on a day pressure was right in their face. 
To send this riveting American League Championship Series to a Game 7. 
I know I won't be able to sleep tonight - too excited!!!!!  
 urlLink The Cubs Cubbed out  
Destiny? Fate? The fan in Game 6? Whatever. The Cubs were unable to end their long, strange drought because Ivan Rodriguez, Miguel Cabrera and these remarkably resilient Marlins won their third straight game to clinch the National League pennant.   
 urlLink BartCop says:  
"Baseball playoffs 

 As of Monday night, the Sox are 2-2 and the Cubbies are 3-2. 
 There's a chance it'll be the Red Sox vs the Cubs in the World Series. 

 This is scary damn stuff. 
 This is like Britney winning the Grammy. 
 Or  bartcop.com  winning "most intelligent website." 

 You non-baseball fans might need help putting this is perspective. 
 But just in case, ... your great-grandfather was too young to remember the last Cubs Series. 

 This is like some goddamn non-Sol comet. 
 It only swings around every 178 years - the Red Sox vs the Cubs in the World Series. 

 If you have a diety, pray to it. 
 I want to see this comet streak across the sky. 

 Seriously, I grew up Catholic and baseball. 
 This weird convergence could mean something"  
I guess we don't have to worry about that anymore.

  HALLOWEEN APPROACHING   
Halloween is my husband's favorite holiday and he always outdoes himself on the fright factor.  However, it looks like  urlLink This year's big movies spark Halloween buying.  When the clock strikes Halloween this year, don't be surprised if it's Neo, Roxie Hart and Captain Jack Sparrow asking, "Trick or treat?" -- instead of the ghost, the ghoul and the goblin. 

If you haven't guessed already, Halloween is getting a heavy dose of Hollywood this year, with the hot costumes inspired by a few blockbuster hits, such as "Matrix Reloaded," "Chicago" and "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."

 urlLink Asteroid Gets Within 52,000 Miles of Earth  
PHOENIX - An asteroid discovered by Arizona astronomers last month passed within 52,000 miles of Earth — the closest documented approach of an asteroid that didn't collide with the atmosphere. 


Close encounters with asteroids of its size, about 3 to 6 meters in diameter, are not unusual, astronomers believe, but catching images and documenting orbits of those asteroids are difficult.  

  SOME POLITICAL RANTS IN SPITE OF BEING BUMMED BY THE BOSOX    urlLink  Dean, Kerry Exchange Insults Over Iraq  
Democrat Howard Dean and John Kerry traded insults Monday over the war in Iraq, with Kerry faulting his presidential rival for a lack of policy and Dean complaining that "we wouldn't be there if it weren't for Democrats like Senator Kerry."   

 urlLink Dean and Clark's civil union  
When Clark entered the race 10 days ago, many saw him as the stop-Dean candidate, drafted by party leaders to head off the former Vermont governor's grass-roots insurgence. Suddenly, the remarkable bottom-up movement that catapulted Dean to the top of the Democratic pack was being trumped by a top-down attempt to impose an arguably more electable candidate on the party. The man who energized followers by excoriating Democrats for acting like Republicans was now being challenged by a Democrat who, until recently, may have actually been a Republican.

   

The latest scrap between the two candidates started Saturday, the first anniversary of House passage of the congressional resolution authorizing the use of military force in Iraq. To bolster its argument that Kerry had switched sides since voting for the measure, the Dean campaign issued a list of quotes from the Massachusetts senator that it said highlighted his inconsistencies.

  THE REASON GAME 3 WAS SO UGLY  
 urlLink J.Lo, Affleck Attend Red Sox-Yankees Game  
This is EXACTLY the sort of thing that puts bad juju on the BoSox and makes them lose.  Should have known that nothing good could come from a game that these two were attending.  They stole the Sox' mojo and made for the bad vibes present at Game 3.  They should be banned from Fenway.  However, they can attend all the Yankee Stadium games they can stomach.  
 MY BELOVED BOSOX BAD PRESS  
 urlLink Role reversal: Red Sox now the bad guys  
They’ve already done the impossible by making the Yankees look like the good guys. They may as go all the way and win the darned ALCS and go on to replay that 1918 World Series with the Cubs.   

 urlLink Rain cools off Yanks-BoSox   "No baseball and no fights. But plenty of rain, fines, apologies and finger-pointing at Fenway Park.Game 4 of the AL championship series was rained out Sunday, giving the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox a day to reflect on the nastiness of their basebrawl game the day before."  
 CUBS ONE GAME AWAY....   
 urlLink Marlins Send NLCS Back to Chicago  Marlins Send NLCS Back to Chicago.  Josh Beckett and the Florida Marlins put history on hold — at least for a couple of days. With the Chicago Cubs set to clinch their first World Series trip in 58 years, Beckett buzzed Sammy Sosa in pitching a two-hitter and leading the Marlins to a 4-0 win Sunday in Game 5 of the NL championship series. Even more notable: Beckett became the first pitcher to throw a postseason shutout against the Cubs since Babe Ruth did it for Boston in the 1918 World Series opener.

It was a brutal game with emotions on high.   urlLink 2 Yanks may face charges .  The Yankees denied the players were to blame.

 urlLink BoSox fans try to exorcise demons  
Twenty miles north of Yankee Stadium the Babe’s grave in Gate of Heaven cemetery was drawing heavy traffic.

        STRANGE DAYS INDEED - MOST PECULIAR MAMA   
Was it the rain or was it the  urlLink full moon ?  I have no idea.  The day went from weird to weirder though.  We started out the day with a beautiful  urlLink "autumn" rain  that lasted most of the morning and cleared up to a steamy day.  We all enjoyed the weather and the cooler temps.  We had the windows open at work and enjoyed the smell of the rain that only Phoenix has.  However, the calm was DURING the storm.  
They let the Milkman go at work.  He got called up to Human Resources and I worked the Help Desk alone.  Finally went out for break around 2:30 and was told by my lead to "stay on break until further notice".  They gave the Milkman his walking papers and had him clean out his cubicle.  I guess it was bad vibes boy and girls!  I stayed out of the office in the other building until it was time to clock out and go home.  Had to have them hand me my stuff through the window.  Wild.I have to say that I will miss him - not his belching, farting and slacking - but his HUGE presence.  I didn't get to say goodbye.  
  PARENTAL RAVES   
Then come home to find that the son had cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom.  I ALMOST SWOONED!!!!!!  Then he left shortly after I got home to go get a HAIRCUT!!!!  Short - like  urlLink Keanu Reeves  - to go with his  urlLink Neo  costume for Halloween.  UNREAL. 
Got the daughter ready and took her to the game.  Came home and waited for the husband and we went to the game, in our Band Booster tee shirts, together and watched the game.  It was  urlLink AN UGLY HOMECOMING WIN   The Rams won - but just barely.  One of the biggest rivalries in high school football and one of the ugliest games ever watched.  Many of us parents in the stands got silly and bored and proceeded to yell to "Spirit Man" - a kid dressed in purple just standing around.  We were goading him to run with the flag and screamed "run Spirit Man, RUN".  Too funny.We watched our kids' high school beat our alma mater by only one point.  
 The husband got choked up to see the  urlLink Sunnyslope band  - all 19 members of it play.  He had been drum major of that band in 1975 when they were 100 strong and they won State Awards.  It was bittersweet for him.  The daughter's  urlLink WHS Purple Pride Band   did great and rocked the house though.  They played their awesome  urlLink Santana  show and they marched like their lives depended on it.  It was beautiful.  Her date for tonight's dance did the saxophone solo and was great.  They had the Homecoming Royalty crowned at halftime and for the first time in over 25 years they had a real live ram on the field.  The last ram they had was kidnapped and dyed green  by Sunnyslope and when given back to Washington it was then spray painted purple which killed the original Rammy.  This year's Rammy had a purple W banner on him and he stood proud during the coronation of the court.  
The ending fireworks display with the Purple Pride band playing was the highlight of the game.  
  BASEBALL (RED SOX) FEVER - I GOT IT   
 urlLink It doesn't get any better than Game 3  
Clemens was many things to Red Sox fans while winning 192 games and becoming the greatest pitcher in the team’s history, but in the end he became only one thing. He became a traitor because he chose to slip into Yankee pinstripes before his career ended and for this he can never be forgiven. That is simply how it is and how it will be when he takes the mound to challenge the hero who replaced him, Pedro Martinez.  
 urlLink Boston has become nation of hope    The Red Sox’ quixotic 85-year quest for a World Series championship — which they haven’t won since selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees at the end of World War I — has etched itself indelibly, and painfully, on the local psyche. It is as much a part of Boston as Puritanism and baked beans.  Three wins away from the World Series, the ranks of Red Sox Nation — as the devout legion of fans across New England united mostly by their years of shared misery call themselves — swell by the day.  
 urlLink Clemens-Martinez duel takes Game 3 spotlight : "Clemens vs. Martinez. It's more than a baseball game."And given that it is Roger Clemens' final start in Fenway Park, where he spent the first 13 seasons of his major league career, emotions are sure to be high today when he pitches against Pedro Martinez in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.  
 urlLink Unlikely hero propels Cubs to Game 3 win  In a tense duel that typified October baseball, Glanville delivered the tiebreaking hit in the 11th inning and Chicago got the final out on a crazy play to beat the Marlins 5-4 Friday night for a 2-1 lead in the NL championship series.

        DEBATE UPDATE   
Had a grand time at the debate party last night.  There were several thousand Dean supporters who all gathered to watch the debate together.  It was fun to see the  urlLink Democrats blast Bush — and Clark.  Dean accused several rivals of giving Bush “a blank check to go to war in Iraq” by voting for or voicing support for a congressional resolution last year.  I think that for the most part they all did very well expressing their viewpoints and most of them tried to put  urlLink Clark in the Hot Seat.   My favorite part - of course - was  urlLink Dean, running on the left as a Washington outsider , saying the party hasn't taken a strong enough stand against Bush and his policies. 

"Why do you think I am where I am, having come from no place at the end of January? It's because I've gone out and given 50 percent of Americans who have given up on voting in this country a reason to vote again," he said. 

"We have to have the values of the Democratic Party, but in Washington, the culture is, 'Say whatever it takes to get elected.' And the minute you're willing to say whatever it takes to get elected, you lose, because the American people are not nearly as dumb as the people in Washington think we are."    It was a lot of fun and I met a lot of great people there who are as committed as me to ousting Bush.  I also saw a lot of people I had met at the  urlLink Meetups  and the  urlLink District 11 Democrats  meetings.  My co-worker,  urlLink Kevin , was there as well and we shared some drinks and did a lot of rallying.  The best part was when Dean himself came and spoke to the group.  It was very exciting and felt grand to be part of something big.

  HOMECOMING WEEKEND   
Tonight is  urlLink Washington High School's  Homecoming game.  My darling daughter will be marching in the  urlLink WHS Purple Pride Marching Band  when her school matches up against the husband and my alma mater -  urlLink Sunnyslope High School.   It's a classice rivalry that has been going on for decades.  Washington is  urlLink ranked #4 in 4A  in the Arizona  urlLink High School Football rankings . It's been raining here all day so tonight's game should be a good one - we will be nice and cool and see which team is the better mudder.  So today I am wearing my Band Booster t-shirt which made the daughter very happy - thrilled in fact.  She got a little weepy when I took her to band practice this morning because of it.  Then I blared the  urlLink Beach Boys: Be True To Your School  on the way to practice and we sang along loud and proud.  I told her she probably thought I was crazy and she said "that's what I love about you Mom".  It choked me up that my daughter embraces my insanity.    
  MY CAR UGLY?

Thanks heavens the  urlLink Red Sox come out swinging  last night and gave NY the spanking they so deserve.  I was also thrilled to see the  urlLink Cubs pulled even  in their series.  My dream of a Red Sox/Cubs World Series seems closer than ever.  However, in more BIZARRE baseball news -  
 urlLink Kerry, Dean In Sox Squabble   
Kerry last month accused Dean, the former Vermont governor and current front-runner for the Democratic nomination, of being a Yankees fan. 

Dean, a New York native, called the accusation insulting, and insisted he backs Boston. 

"Howard Dean has a relationship with the Yankees that goes way back so we hope he is willing to put some chowder behind his childhood team," Kerry spokeswoman Kelley Benander said. 

Dean, however, told reporters in Iowa that he's rooting for the Red Sox. He's also pulling for the Chicago Cubs to beat the Florida Marlins in the National League Championship Series.  "I always root for the underdog," Dean said. "Those are the two biggest underdogs." 
With Boston preparing to face archrival New York in the American League Championship Series, Kerry, D-Mass. said Tuesday that if New York beats Boston in the best-of-seven series that begins Wednesday, he'll send New England clam chowder to Dean's campaign. He wants Manhattan chowder from Dean if Boston wins.

I expect them to really go after each other," Pederson said. "I don't think that's all bad. All the candidates realize that this is the time to carve out a niche for themselves and get above the field. The focus of the country is on Arizona. We've never been on the political stage like this before."  I hope to win the raffle for tickets to the actual debate and if so ask Dean if he is really a closet NY Yankees fan.

We also got her some jewelry (aka bling bling) to match along with a purse.  I breezed through  urlLink Old Navy  and snagged myself some new khakis and some long sleeved t-shirts for when/if it ever cools down here.  We also got some excellent joe at  urlLink The Coffee Plantation .  We had a grand "girl time" at  urlLink Metrocenter  and she's all set for Saturday's dance.    
The son is going to the same dance with his girlfriend who is still a senior.  I guess he's wearing the same suit he wore before.  I asked him yesterday what he was wearing and he went off on how he needed a coat like Neo from  urlLink "The Matrix" .  I ordered him one from  urlLink EBay  thinking he and his girlfriend were going to Homecoming as Neo and Trinity.  I busted a hump getting the damned coat.  When I told him I got it in time for the dance he said "we aren't wearing them then - that's for Halloween - wearing that to Homecoming would be WRONG".  I felt like a dork and relieved at the same time.  However, now his girlfriend thinks it might be cool to go in costume.  Have mercy on us all.

However, I then have to decide whether to go to the  urlLink Dean Meetup   and do something that makes a difference in the world or to stay home and watch  urlLink  The West Wing .  In additon to the The West Wing; the  urlLink Boston Red Sox  are in the playoffs tonight.  Ok, Ok, I know what y'all are thinking - tape the tv show, listen to the game on the radio and go to the meetup after taking the daughter to dance.  It's just not the same and makes for a hectic night for me.  I have no idea when I will watch the taped shows (I have last week's on tape too) and we all know that the  urlLink Cubs, Red Sox playoff berths mean the end is near .

        THANKSGIVING   
We had many reasons for giving thanks.  My son is over his ranting and raving of Tuesday night, my daughter is growing into a beautiful girl, my husband and I are both happy in our marriage of 23 years and have jobs.  We have many things to be grateful for.  They say that 
 urlLink Thanksgiving  is a collective feast which  presents a simple ceremony that focuses on gratitude and the ties that bind us as Americans.  Our family had a grand  urlLink  Thanksgiving .  My sister flew in from Texas, my oldest sister was there for the first time in 2 years.  Both of them are going through  
 urlLink divorces  and this was especially poignant for them.  My brother and his new bride and baby were there.  It was the first time in over 23 years that the 4 of us siblings had been at the same table for Thanksgiving.  It was a joyous and relaxing day filled with laughter and tears.  It was truly a reason for thanks.  

  PLAYOFFS OVER FOR RAMS - BUMMER   
As we were whipped up into a semi-playoff fever with the sister from Texas (band mom supreme) there to finally see the daughter march with band.  We adorned ourselves in purple and showed up at Glendale Community College for the games with high hopes and dreams of the State Championships.  Alas, it was not to be as 
 urlLink Cactus rolled over Washington .  It was a sad end to a glorious season and we all could not be prouder of our team and band for making it that far.  Next year.......  
  PRESIDENTIAL THANKSGIVING GRANDSTANDING RANTS   

 urlLink The turkey has landed  
Bush cooked up a secret mission to give thanks to his troops 
 urlLink Bush Surprises Troops in Iraq   
Bush quietly slipped away from his Texas ranch Wednesday and flew to Washington, where he changed planes and picked up a few staff members for the long flight to the Iraqi capital. The presidential visit had been planned for almost six weeks but was tightly held, even by a small media pool traveling with him, until after Bush left Baghdad. 

With a tear in his eye, Bush stunned 600 soldiers at a Thanksgiving celebration in the makeshift military base at Baghdad International Airport. He burst onstage with little warning and told them they are "defeating the terrorists here in Iraq so we don't have to face them in our own country.  
 urlLink An Indelible Moment in A War and Presidency  : "In contrast to Bush's carrier landing, which they immediately branded a stunt, Bush's critics yesterday did not begrudge him the trip to Iraq, nor the necessary secrecy, nor even the disinformation the White House used to lead people to believe he would be at home on his ranch in Texas all day. Rather, they said the visit may come to reinforce their view that the administration has led the United States into a lonely occupation of Iraq without an obvious exit strategy. 
Bush's entourage was fitted with ballistic vests, and the plane came in with neither running lights nor cabin lights, parking on a dark landing strip. 'The message to the Iraqis is Bush doesn't think their country is secure,' said Sidney Blumenthal, a former adviser to Clinton. 'It underscores the insecurity, and it conveys insularity.' " 
 urlLink  Bush Visit to Iraq Becomes Talk of Baghdad  
President Bush's surprise visit to Iraq was the talk of Baghdad's teahouses, kebab shops and mosques Friday, with many Iraqis asking why he didn't take advantage of his trip to see firsthand how his rule has treated them. 
 urlLink  Rice Defends Bush's Surprise Iraq Visit  "Bush said he thought Americans would be understanding about the deception because it was important for soldiers at risk to know that the commander in chief and the country supported them and appreciated their sacrifices. 
He told reporters that Americans understand that if the trip had been announced 'it would have put me in harm's way. It would have put others in harm's way, including yourselves" 
 urlLink  President's visit pumps up troops : "'Thanksgiving has got to be hard for young troops that know that their families are gathered in, having dinner and the turkey feast and everything,' Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One following the visit to Baghdad.
'I felt like at this point, that it ... would help them to see their president.'" 
Hey, Governor!  
  Did you even invite Al Gore to go along?

His "Invest for Success" plan would fully fund Head Start, double enrollment in Early Head Start, offer preschool to every 4-year-old and provide child care for another 1.4 million children, according to an outline of the plan obtained by The Associated Press.  
 urlLink  HOWARD DEAN FOR PRESIDENT  
But the rubber would really tear up the road at the presidential debates, where Dean's dry, sardonic Long Island wit would devastate the hapless Bush--and charm television viewers. His natural pugnacity could help Dems deal more aggressively than usual with the nasty attack ads they can expect in the campaign ahead. Frankly, the other Democratic contenders don't have what it takes to stand up to Karl Rove's brutal war machine. Maybe it's premature to endorse Gov. Dean. But right now, given the information we have available, he's the preferred candidate of us Anybody But Bushies.  


By the time he leaves Phoenix three hours and 40 minutes later, the president will have added well over $1 million to the Bush-Cheney campaign coffers, surpassing the $925,000 that federal records show he raised from Arizona residents in his entire 2000 campaign.

        MID-LIFE MID-WEEK RANTS   
Here it is another middle of the week.  Wednesday - "all day" - as my mother says.  Seems like it's taking forever for Friday to get here.  I am training the new guy at work - The Milkman's replacement.  He seems like a very nice young man.  Hard to get past a young man only 4 years older than my son working with me.  Kind of weird becoming one of the "older people" in the office.    Man, it's weird.  Never used to think I was this old. Welcome to mid-life eh?   
Working myself up into another   urlLink playoff  frenzy.  It's almost sad.  Getting whipped up for high school football again.  I just find the whole process and what it does to these young kids amazing.  I know that for a lot of the players they will be looking back at these "glory days" and telling their children.  It's bittersweet.    
Went and saw  urlLink  'Matrix' Revolutions  last week.  I liked it.  I didn't think it as good as the first two - which I LOVED - but it rang the chimes of this "geek".  I have been telling myself all week that "there is always choice".  Kind of a nice mantra.

Currently  urlLink  U.S. Troops pull bodies from Iraq chopper wrecks  and retrieved bodies and wreckage on Sunday from two Black Hawk helicopters which came down under fire in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, killing at least 17 soldiers. The heaviest U.S. loss of life in a single incident since the invasion of Iraq in March came on Saturday just hours after Washington set the country on a swifter passage to self-rule in a bid to calm Iraqi anger at occupation. 
Then it's determined - amazingly - that there is  urlLink no sign Saddam transferred WMD  at all.  A new study by an independent military and intelligence expert who toured Iraq recently found no evidence that Saddam Hussein tried to transfer weapons of mass destruction to terrorists.    
Once again - seems we were led down the wrong path and still have the nerve to act surprised when we think we see insurgance.   urlLink WHY WE FIGHT  brings up a good point when it states:  
 "You are joining a broad and diverse coalition dedicated to one principle: Iraq for Iraqis. Our leaders include generals of President Saddam Hussein's secular government as well as fundamentalist Islamists. We are Sunni and Shia, Iraqi and foreign, Arab and Kurdish. Though we differ on what kind of future our country should have after liberation and many of us suffered under Saddam, we are fighting side by side because there is no dignity under the brutal and oppressive jackboot of the U.S. Coalition Provisional Authority or their Vichyite lapdogs on the Governing Council, headed by embezzler Ahmed Chalabi."

The next day was the  urlLink Peoria High School Marching Band Invitational   and I decided that watching the  urlLink WHS Purple Pride Marching Band   was way more important than cleaning house.  I went and spent the day watching some grand bands.  The Purple Pride band did AWESOME - but they did not get the excellent ranking they needed to get them to the State Championships.  The daughter was most bummed and bawled like an infant on my shoulder after we had sat in the rain all day to hear the results.  It tore me up and as a freshman band mom this was difficult for me to take.  My first instinct was to go ream the judges a new one but I got her calmed down and dropped off at the school to go see the  urlLink Bands of America .  The husband and I then went out for dinner and I went to bed early after we got home.  I was too tired for words.   
Sunday was a day full of cleaning, laundry and general sloth.  The pace we go at is amazing.  We basically hung out and napped and putzed between naps.  Kind of sad actually.    
The week at work has been wild so far.  I don't think we are busy because we are shorthanded as the Milkman never did that much work anyway.  However, this week has been busy with calls that fall into the category of: 
1.  Passwords 
2.  Printers 
3.  Pinheads 
The weather hasn't helped either - we went from over 100 degrees 3 weeks ago to barely over 70 degrees this week.  That really makes the desert dwellers lose their minds so traffic and the calls to the Help Desk have been crazy.  
What's more my  urlLink PT Cruiser  is in the shop for warrranty repair so I don't have my stylin' wheels.  No lunch for me today or tomorrow either.   Have I already said I will be glad when this week is over?  
  POLITICAL FUNNY STUFF

 urlLink Al Sharpton to Host 'Saturday Night Live'  
Sharpton will host the Dec. 6 show, which also will feature Pink as the musical guest. It could be a natural fit for the preacher, who often uses humor to promote his long-shot candidacy and is known to crack up his rivals during debates.  
  FULL BLOWN POLITICAL RANTS   
 urlLink High court questions Bush officials' secrecy  
The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Bush administration to explain the secrecy surrounding the detention of one of the immigrants arrested after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
 urlLink Baghdad Made Last-Ditch Try to Avoid War  
Just days before U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq, officials claiming to speak for a frantic Iraqi regime made a last-ditch effort to avert the war, but U.S. officials rebuffed the overture, Pentagon officials said Thursday. 
 urlLink CBS Cancels Reagan Mini-Series Amid Controversy  
A statement from the Viacom Inc.-owned network said the decision was "based solely on our reaction to seeing the final film, not the controversy that erupted around a draft of the script."

  DEAN WATCH   
 urlLink Dean comment sparks Democratic name-calling free-for-all
  
A comment by Howard Dean about Confederate flags and pickup trucks has embroiled the leading Democrats in Iowa’s presidential caucuses in a name-calling donnybrook. 
 urlLink Dean expresses 'regret' over flag flap  
“I regret the pain that I have caused, but I will tell you there is no easy way to do this and there will be pain as we discuss it and we must face this together hand in hand as Dr. King and Abraham Lincoln asked us to do,” Dean said.  
  SPEAKING OF RASTAS......

 urlLink  Lawyer Gets Rapped for Singing Bob Marley Tune  
The lawyer for a man convicted of shooting and killing a policeman apologized on Monday for singing the Bob Marley hit "I Shot The Sheriff" as he was leaving the courtroom.  "I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense," the lawyer sang while pacing a corridor. "It's the story of my client," he replied when a journalist warned him that his performance had been caught on tape.

        CHRISTMAS EVE   
It's Christmas Eve.  The tree is finally decorated as of Tuesday.  The shopping and wrapping is finished as of Wednesday.  The house is cleaned, food purchased and we are having a tranquil night - just the 4 of us - watching  urlLink 'A Christmas Story'   and waiting for  urlLink  Santa  .  We are together and happy and healthy and this is what is important and to realize we are very blessed. 
 
Here in Phoenix families are gathered and they eat  urlLink tamales  and light  urlLink luminarias .  As in years past, many will join in  urlLink Las Posadas  to represent one of the ways the Hispanic culture influences the Valley religiously.  Processions of people follow individuals portraying Mary and Joseph from home to home looking for a place to take them in before the birth of their son, Jesus.  It's a beautiful tradition. 
Other regions have different traditions that are not as beautiful.  Take the  urlLink  `Naked Elves'   for example.  What began as a practical joke has evolved into an odd yuletide tradition: Grown men wearing red boxer shorts, Santa hats and lighted suspenders as they travel around Birmingham singing off-key carols.  

 urlLink Ho, ho, humbug  
Not everyone has reason to celebrate the holiday as the majority of the American populace does.  
  ANOTHER BUSH LIE   
 urlLink Saddam was held by Kurdish forces, drugged and left for US troops  
The embedded reporters went along with this week-old lie so they could priase Bush.  Lie after lie, week after week, and nobody calls Bush on it but a few websites.  When is somebody going to call Bush on his mountains of lies that have killed thousands? 
As in just in time for Holiday angst;  urlLink Nation's threat level goes to orange, or high risk of terrorist attack .  
Bush needs a distraction after phoney Saddam capture.  
Bush said Osama was "of no concern," and that's why he wernt after the "real" threat - Saddam, 
 a trembling old man with no weapons of mass distruction and no means to deliver any such weapons.  If the Al Qaeda threat is real, and they are preparing to attack us on American soil, then why are we half-way around the globe bullying countries like Iraq?  Maybe we should go to a  urlLink Code Red

        HOLIDAZE   
Yikes. Here it is a week before Christmas.  The kids are out of school until January and it's been crazy and hectic.  So hectic I haven't blogged in 2 weeks.  That's just wrong.  Especially since there is so much going on.  Ah well, an update and then I can get to that later. 
Since the 5th of December my life has been  nonstop holiday errands.  We've had band concerts, we've had dance recitals, we've had parties and commitments out the ying-yang. (and we all know how painful that can be)  My daughter got her braces off and the son has finished his first semester at community college.  The husband did about 3 side gigs for the holidays and I have spent my time driving people places or going shopping.  I am happy to report that I have my shopping done.  I hope.  I have been to  urlLink JCPenney , to  urlLink Target , to  urlLink Old Navy , to  urlLink Best Buy  and ultimately to  urlLink Cost Plus World Market  for the "gift basket goods".  Seems like as the kids all get bigger and the family grows there is more and more.  It's not a wonder that people are saying " urlLink Lighten up, will you?" .  It makes you realize how holiday stress is affected by age and gender.  Almost 52 percent of the women responding, ages 35 to 54, said their stress levels go up during the holidays. By contrast, 40 percent of surveyed men in the same age bracket said their stress levels increase with the holidays.   I believe it.  My  urlLink Holiday Stress  level is way up there.  This is why  urlLink Americans lose sleep over holidays .  If that's not enough they now say that  urlLink  even dogs get the blues at Holiday Time .  The holidays are just not a good time for the family dog.  Since I am so much like the family dog I think it's safe to say that the holidays are not good for me either.  I am exhausted and we have a week to go.  We have the celebration with the husband's family this Sunday and still NO CLUE what my family is doing.  The uncertainty of that doesn't help my psyche one bit.  
It think I have a plan though..... I will continue to look for the beauty in the season.  The beauty of the smile from a stranger, the beauty in the lights strung up on houses and the look of wonder on the children's faces.    
  LOCAL NEWS   
Arizona has been strange the past couple of weeks.  First off - this news from a school in the district I work for:  
 urlLink School face scanner to search for sex offenders  "School face scanner to search for sex offenders" 
"If it works one time, locates one missing child or saves a child from a sexual attack, I feel it's worth it," said Arpaio, a tough-talking sheriff who has previously gained notoriety for his chain gangs and prison-issued pink underwear.  
Then we have the grand information that  urlLink Flu outbreak widespread in 24 states  and on Thursday, the CDC added Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia to the list of states with widespread flu activity, meaning outbreaks of influenza or increases in influenza-like illnesses and lab-confirmed influenza samples in at least half the state.  Glad I had my flu shot.  However, going out and seeing people hacking and sneezing give you pause for concern.  
Sometimes I think that I should scare up the scratch and move outta' town.  I saw that  urlLink  Tortilla Flat is for Sale on EBay  
Tortilla Flat is a little spot of land with a few wood buildings near the Salt River Lakes and is for sale on the Internet for $5.5 million.   I could raise me up a brood o' bassets out there.  Wouldn't need high fences.  Might even get a pony.    
  MISC. THOUGHTS   
 urlLink How Monty Python changed the world    
  DEAN WATCH   
It sure been a busy couple of weeks for Dr. Dean.  First off he gets an endorsement and  urlLink Gore urges Dems to rally around Dean  
Al Gore  endorsed Howard Dean's presidential bid praising the front-runner's fervent opposition to the Iraq war while urging Democrats to unite behind Dean five weeks before the first votes are cast. Gore, who captured the popular vote but lost the electoral count to George W. Bush, said Dean's stance against the war, above all else, swayed him.  Of course  urlLink Gore's backing propels Dean  to the front of the Democratic pack which in turn has  urlLink  rivals gang up on Dean, Gore in debate .  The final faceoff of the year found Dean's rivals passing on their usual criticism of his policies, focused as they were on Gore's blockbuster endorsement. They appealed to the independent streak of voters here, and suggested the former vice president's support smacked of old-style party machine politics.  Dean fired back: "If you guys are upset that Al Gore is endorsing me, attack me, don't attack Al Gore. ... I don't think he deserves to be attacked by anybody up here. He doesn't; he's not a boss. He's a fundamentally decent human being. We share a lot of values."   It's been a boon to Dean's campaign and the Arizona Republic had this interview with  urlLink Howard Dean  when he came to Arizona on Tuesday.  It seems that 
 urlLink Dean talks to Arizona on a series of issues  during a grueling day of appearances Tuesday in Arizona.  Dean expressed misgivings about guest-worker programs and said undocumented workers should be able to earn the right to become citizens.  In addition  urlLink Dean talked defense as he arrived in the Valley  and a new poll shows Dean breaking away from the pack of nine Democratic candidates in the Feb. 3 Arizona primary race, with a relatively large number of voters still undecided.   urlLink Dean Working to Be Seen as Foreign Policy Centrist   and says  urlLink   America Not Safer After Capture .  Of course this has made the looms come out of the woodwork and attack him.  Now we all know that  urlLink Ann Coulter is Completely Nuts   when she writes: 
"VEGAN COMPUTER GEEKS FOR DEAN - The cover story in this week's New York Times magazine described Howard Dean's hardcore support as consisting primarily of impotent nosepickers hoping to make some friends and unsuccessful auditioners for Gap commercials. That is to say, the followers (as opposed to leaders) of tomorrow."  
This woman is nuttier than my Grandmother's fruitcake - and uglier too.  
  PHONY BUSH BALONEY   
It's been a wild month for our pResident.  He flies to Baghdad to server decorative turkey to the troops, only to find upon his return the press kissing his ass and everyone saying the economy is in a "turnaround".  Ha!!!  If the economy is so good them why is  urlLink  IBM moving 4,700 hi-tech jobs to Asia?   This is one of the biggest such actions yet in the technology industry. 
Then, Dubya's ol' buddy Uncle Dick gets in hot water as a  urlLink Pentagon audit finds Halliburton overcharged .  A Pentagon audit of Halliburton, the oil services firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney, has found the company overcharged for fuel it brought into Kuwait from Iraq.   In fact,  urlLink  Halliburton may have overcharged millions .  So true to form, our pResident runs damage control and announces that  urlLink  U.S. expects overcharge money back .  
 Yikes, that's rich. 
Then to add to his string of broken promises  urlLink Bush backs off pledge to fund Global AIDS Fight
 .  The Wall Street Journal reports, "President Bush plans to ask Congress for relatively small funding increases to fight AIDS and poverty in the developing world, stepping back from his highly publicized pledge to spend huge sums to help fight them."1 The President's decision is just the latest step in a calculated effort to slowly - but surely - abandon his own commitment to fully fund the global fight against AIDS. 
And if that wasn't enough (and it really is isn't it?)  
 urlLink  9/11 Investigative Committee Chair says  "Attack Was Preventable"  . For the first time, the chairman of the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks is saying publicly that 9/11 could have and should have been prevented.   
Could it be that the press and the public are FINALLY wising up?  We can only hope.  
  SADDAM   
 urlLink Saddam Hussein Captured Alive Near Tikrit .  That was the news on Sunday and it's been the news since then.  I suspect we shall have a "Total Saddam Christmas".  I guess it's good news.  I want to know how  urlLink Saddam was found, but bin Laden is still at large .  (not to mention the anthrax attacker)  Many analysts argue that with bin Laden still free and possibly planning more attacks on U.S. soil and elsewhere, including perhaps in Iraq itself, he poses a far more potent threat than the former Iraqi leader.
 urlLink  Saddam Arrest Cheer Fades Into Iraqi Ire at U.S. .  Many were ecstatic to see Saddam captured and hoped he would answer for his deeds but said they would not rush to thank America -- in their eyes the source of their problems since a U.S.-led coalition toppled Saddam in April.  
 urlLink Saddam, So Not Worth It   Dubya, now that you've got your dime-store thug, can you stop the warmongering and death? 
 urlLink OK, we got him; what happens now?

 urlLink Signs of the Season  
 urlLink Some pearls of wisdom to help raise holiday spirits   
  SMOKE, MIRRORS AND FAKE TURKEY   
 urlLink As White House Changes Story, British Airways Refutes Bush Story of Pilot Sighting  
In his trip to Baghdad, President Bush said he would have immediately turned around had his cover been blown. In trying to play up the secrecy and dangerous nature of the trip, Bush's aides said that a British Airways pilot spotted the president's plane, radioing, "Did I just see Air Force One?" The White House said Air Force One responded: "Gulfstream 5" - a code word to disguise the plane - and the British Airways pilot "seemed to sense he was in on a secret and replied 'Oh.'"

But now it appears the story was a complete fabrication, designed only to hype the story. According to Reuters, "British Airways said yesterday that none of its pilots made contact with President Bush's plane during its secret flight to Baghdad on Thanksgiving, contradicting White House reports of a midair exchange that nearly prompted Bush to call off his trip." 
 urlLink The Bird Was Fake  
In the most widely published image from his Thanksgiving day trip to Baghdad, the beaming president is wearing an Army workout jacket and surrounded by soldiers as he cradles a huge platter laden with a golden-brown turkey. But as a small sign of the many ways the White House maximized the impact of the 21/2-hour stop at the Baghdad airport, administration officials said yesterday that Bush picked up a decoration, not a serving plate. Military sources said a trophy turkey is a standard feature of holiday chow lines.  



  DEAN WATCH   
 urlLink Dean grilled, stands ground  
In the hourlong question-and-answer session broadcast on MSNBC's "Hardball," part of a series of discussions with the Democratic candidates, Dean seemed to enjoy himself as he volleyed with Matthews, getting in a few laugh lines, most at the expense of President Bush.

Asked whether Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein should be tried in the United States or the Hague should they be captured, Dean responded that the issue was premature for discussion because "the president can't find either one of them."

 urlLink Conservatives want Reagan on dimes  
Supporters of the “Ronald Reagan Dime Act” said Roosevelt and his government-expanding New Deal represented decades past, while Reagan’s conservative, anti-communist administration ushered in society as it exists today.   “IF THEY WANT to find another way to honor Ronald Reagan, I’m happy to join with them, but leave the dime alone,” said Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass.

The Denver Zoo's four orangutans are smelling pretty good these days — they're getting daily aromatherapy treatments. That means the 20-year-old ape Mias gets chamomile on his right ear, basil and angelica on his nose, and fennel, eucalyptus and frankincense on his forehead.

       urlLink  No Child Left Behind law leaves schools' old ways behind   According to a recent study by the Center for Basic Education, a Washington-based think tank, many U.S. schools are reporting a narrowing of the curriculum as a result of the new emphasis on reading and math. The impact of No Child Left Behind has been particularly great in schools with large minority populations which tend to have lower test scores and are under the most pressure to improve.  Roughly eight in 10 principals of such schools surveyed by the center reported an increase in instructional time for math and reading over the past three years. A third of these principals reported a loss of instructional time for the arts, and 42 percent anticipated further cuts in arts education.  What a shame this is when we have to turn to  urlLink VH1 Save The Music   
Meanwhile, Ashcroft has too much time on his hands as evidenced by the actions at a school district near us.   urlLink FBI raids Deer Valley school district; reasons remain a mystery   The site houses the district's information services and technology offices, essentially the "brains" of the district's computer system, said Timothy Tait, a district spokesman.  School officials were not warned in advance and know nothing about the reason for the action,, Tait said.  Susan Herskovits, an FBI spokeswoman, said agents were expected to remain on site throughout the day but she refused to disclose the reason for the sweep.  "It's a federal search warrant but it's under seal, so we can't talk about what we're looking for or the nature of the case," Herskovits said.   urlLink FBI raids school office in Glendale  and elsewhere in the country raided schools and other targets in a national crackdown on pirated music CDs and movies.  Don't they have terrorists to chase?   
Here in Arizona  urlLink students who passed pushed to retake AIMS .  About 50,000 Arizona sophomores are taking the high school AIMS math test today because they have to, but some juniors and seniors have been enticed to voluntarily take it again. Last year, at the urging of Arizona's newly elected schools chief, Tom Horne, state officials allowed schools to receive extra credit for students who not only passed the test but placed in the top "exceeds standards" category in the reading, writing and math sections. Giving schools a better public ranking for improving AIMS scores forces schools to focus on the needs of average and bright children. Without that incentive, Horne fears these students will be ignored and schools will focus time, money and energy on bringing kids at the bottom up to passing.

       urlLink The Race Heats Up   After weeks of increasingly violent news from Iraq, presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts now leads the president in a two-way trial heat by seven points (50 percent to 43 percent), according to the latest NEWSWEEK poll. Even after adding independent candidate Ralph Nader to the hypothetical race, Kerry enjoys a four-point lead (46 percent to 42 percent), with Nader drawing 4 percent of the vote.

 urlLink Smarty Jones: Running from the heart   by  Gene Lyons  
"Things are lousy 
on the political front, and polls show Americans feeling apprehensive and uneasy. But there’s 
far too much competition for attention in today’s diffuse and omnipresent news media, and these 
days you can place a bet on almost anything. Even so, millions of Americans who don’t have a 
dime on the race will cheer themselves hoarse watching Smarty Jones make his stretch run at 
the Belmont on June 5 and, win or lose, an awful lot of them will have tears in their eyes.  

I’m sure I will. I’m not a big racing fan in that I rarely go to the track, but Smarty Jones’ 
perfectly timed, heedless charge around the final turn and into the lead at the Preakness got me 
up and yelling so loudly that Buffy, the office spaniel, got all charged up and ran around barking. 
Even Beverly, the basset hound, was roused from her afternoon power nap.  

Mine was not unusual behavior. During ESPN’s program about the great Secretariat, the only 
non-human in its "100 Greatest Athletes of the 20 th Century" series, the horse’s biographer, 
William Nack, described thousands weeping openly while watching his astonishing 31-length 
victory in the 1973 Belmont Stakes.  
Exactly why people react so emotionally to racehorses is hard to say. From an animal lover’s 
perspective, there’s plenty to criticize about the thoroughbred industry. But even if you’ve never 
ridden or touched a horse, there’s just something about them that captures the human imagination. 
Prehistoric cave paintings in France demonstrate an early fascination with their power and beauty."

        urlLink      blue rose  It is the  urlLink "Holy Grail" of horticulture   and soon it could make the perfect present for Mother's Day: scientists have found a way to produce a blue rose.A chance discovery in a laboratory means that they will be able to create the blue rose "within a year" and it is expected to go on sale to the public soon after that.  Roses come in many colours - from pink to yellow, peach and red - but, until now, no one has found a way to create a natural blue rose and the quest has acquired an almost mystical significance among breeders.   Excellent.  Just like in  urlLink The Glass Menagerie   with the frail and shy Laura (whose nickname, "Blue Roses," refers directly back to Tennesee Williams' real-life sister).  It's awesome.  Years ago I purchased a specialty rose bush - a "blue" variety.  It's a beautiful platinum lavender but I wouldn't call it blue.  When these blue ones are available - I will have one.

The Big Unit struck out eight to become the fourth pitcher to fan 4,000, but the Diamondbacks lost their franchise-record 11th straight game, 3-2 to the San Diego Padres. "I just really wanted to enjoy this as much as I did the (perfect) game in Atlanta, but it's very hard to enjoy something when you lose a ballgame," Johnson said. "Because that's all I live for now."

June 24, 2004 
The former member of the executive branch delivers a timely history lesson on the rationale for limited executive power. Gore says what too few Democrats have been willing to say since 9/11—that what Americans should be most fearful of is not Al Qaeda, but how the government exploits our fear of terrorism to expand its powers. Our nation will always face dangers, but to weaken our democratic system in the name of security will be our undoing.

 urlLink  Voters Shift in Favor of Kerry   More than one-third of those questioned in the nationwide poll said they didn't know enough about Kerry to decide whether he would be a better president than Bush. And when asked which candidate was more likely to flip-flop on issues, almost twice as many named Kerry than Bush. Yet Kerry led Bush by 51% to 44% nationally in a two-way matchup, and by 48% to 42% in a three-way race, with independent Ralph Nader drawing 4%.  Lifting Kerry is a powerful tailwind of dissatisfaction with the nation's course and Bush's answers for challenges at home and abroad. Nearly three-fifths believe the nation is on the wrong track, the highest level a Times poll has recorded during Bush's presidency. Also, 56% said America "needs to move in a new direction" because Bush's policies have not improved the country. Just 39% say America is better off because of his agenda. 
 urlLink Poll: Voters Say Iraq Didn't Merit War   A majority of American registered voters now say conditions in Iraq did not merit war, but most are reluctant to abandon efforts there, according to a new Los Angeles Times poll. Voters are increasingly concerned that Iraq is a quagmire America cannot escape, and they are doubtful that a democratic government will be established there, according to the poll published in Friday editions of the Times. Fifty-three percent of respondents said the situation in Iraq did not merit war, while 43 percent said war was justified. When the same question was asked for Times polls in March and November, the numbers were precisely reversed.

"We have it in our power to change the world again. But only if we're true to our ideals and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight. As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House....My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge. 

Remember the hours after Sept. 11, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon. When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us. 

I am proud that after Sept. 11 all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats. There were no Republicans. There were only Americans. How we wish it had stayed that way. 

Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities and I do because some issues just aren't all that simple. Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so. As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence. I will immediately reform the intelligence system so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics. And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to......"As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower. 

In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals. 

We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared......America can do better. And help is on the way.....My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.....These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values. We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.......Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out. But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine. 

It is time to reach for the next dream. It is time to look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are still to come."

 urlLink Standing Ovation For Al Sharpton  One of many standing ovations went on for a minute after he told delegates that after the nation failed to deliver on Civil War-era promises of '40 acres and mule' to freed slaves, 'we didn't get the mule so we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us.' "Mr. President, the reason we are fighting so hard, the reason we took Florida so seriously, is our right to vote wasn't gained because of our age," Sharpton said. "Our vote was soaked in the blood of martyrs, soaked in the blood of (civil rights activists) Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner, soaked in the blood of four little girls in Birmingham. This vote is sacred to us. This vote can't be bargained away. This vote can't be given away. "In all due respect, Mr. President, read my lips: Our vote is not for sale."

It is a sacred gift, sanctified by those who have lived it and those who have died defending it. My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called "opinionated," is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish. My only hope is that, one day soon, women — who have all earned the right to their opinions — instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are. 
Tonight I want to remember my mother's warmth, generosity, wisdom, and hopefulness, and thank her for all the sacrifices she made on our behalf, like so many other mothers. 
This evening, I want to acknowledge and honor the women of this world, whose wise voices for much too long have been excluded and discounted. It is time for the world to hear women's voices, in full and at last. "

A few of these folks, needless to say, are just grinding a political axe and they should he ashamed of themselves. But many are well-meaning and sincere. Their belief is just that, an article of faith, and they are entitled to it........The tide of history is with us. Like all generations who have come before ours, we are motivated by a thirst for knowledge and compelled to see others in need as fellow angels on an often difficult path, deserving of our compassion. 

In a few months, we will face a choice. Yes, between two candidates and two parties, but more than that. We have a chance to take a giant stride forward for the good of all humanity. We can choose between the future and the past, between reason and ignorance, between true compassion and mere ideology. This is our moment, and we must not falter."

  urlLink   Jimmy Carter      tells it like it is   

"In repudiating extremism we need to recommit ourselves to a few common-sense principles that should transcend partisan differences. First, we cannot enhance our own security if we place in jeopardy what is most precious to us, namely, the centrality of human rights in our daily lives and in global affairs. Second, we cannot maintain our historic self-confidence as a people if we generate public panic. Third, we cannot do our duty as citizens and patriots if we pursue an agenda that polarizes and divides our country. Next, we cannot be true to ourselves if we mistreat others. And finally, in the world at large we cannot lead if our leaders mislead. You can't be a war president one day and claim to be a peace president the next, depending on the latest political polls. When our national security requires military action, John Kerry has already proven in Vietnam that he will not hesitate to act. And as a proven defender of our national security, John Kerry will strengthen the global alliance against terrorism while avoiding unnecessary wars. Ultimately, the issue is whether America will provide global leadership that springs from the unity and integrity of the American people or whether extremist doctrines and the manipulation of truth will define America's role in the world. At stake is nothing less than our nation's soul. " 
President Carter - THANK YOU!

"I’ll be candid with you. I had hoped to be back here this week under different circumstances, running for re-election. But you know the old saying: you win some, you lose some. And then there’s that little-known third category. I didn’t come here tonight to talk about the past. After all, I don’t want you to think I lie awake at night counting and recounting sheep. I prefer to focus on the future because I know from my own experience that America is a land of opportunity, where every little boy and girl has a chance to grow up and win the popular vote........The first lesson is this: take it from me -- every vote counts. In our Democracy, every vote has power. And never forget: that power is yours. Don’t let anyone take it away or talk you into throwing it away. In our Democracy, every vote has power. And never forget: that power is yours. Don’t let anyone take it away or talk you into throwing it away. And let’s make sure that this time every vote is counted." 


 urlLink Gore hammered Bush too! . GO AL!!!! 


"When policies are clearly not working, we can change them. If our leaders make mistakes, we can hold them accountable — even if they never admit their mistakes," said the man who won the popular vote in 2000 but lost the White House. Gore won the popular vote in 2000 but lost the White House when the Supreme Court halted a recount of the Florida vote. To those still disappointed, or angry about it, he said, "I want you to remember all of those feelings. But then I want you to do with them what I have done: Focus them fully and completely on putting John Kerry and John Edwards in the White House." The former vice president has assailed Bush sharply the last two years, accusing him of having "twisted values and atrocious policies." "Has the promise of compassionate conservatism been fulfilled? Or do those words now ring hollow," he asked, invoking Bush's campaign slogan from 2000. "For that matter, are the economic policies really conservative at all? Did you expect, for example, the largest deficits in history ... And the loss of a million jobs." "Regardless of your opinion at the beginning of this war, isn't it now obvious that the way the war has been managed by the administration has gotten us into very serious trouble?" he asked. And on the war on terrorism, he said, "wouldn't we be safer with a president who didn't insist on confusing al-Qaida with Iraq."

       &nbsp;    FINALLY FIXED MY HAIR!    &nbsp;   urlLink     

Thank goodness I went and got my hair fixed on Saturday!&nbsp; It was buggin' the bejesus out of me as you all know.&nbsp; As you can see it's a lot better than I had described on Friday.&nbsp; I took myself down to the  urlLink salon  and had a very nice young woman named Pam work on it. She was very good at not mocking my attempts to blend the gray. This was greatly appreciated. Truly. I explained to her that I was  urlLink going back to gray  but I couldn't deal with the blonde stuff I had in there. She was not judgemental and she determined that I needed some  urlLink lowlighting   in to offset the oncoming gray and the blonde.  She did a weave of my natural medium brown into what was ruined.  She also conditioned the hell out of it.  Then she gave me a nice cut with more layers so as not to get the "pyramid effect" of bushiness.  (NO BUSH!)  I am very happy with it and it was well worth the $85 and $10 tip that it set me back.  The money was worth not going through life with bad hair.

        urlLink        urlLink HAVING A BAD HAIR LIFE      For a while now I have been trying to "delicately" deal with my  urlLink graying hair .&nbsp; Unlike others my age and IQ I decided to try and go it gracefully and let nature take it's course.&nbsp; However, being the shortest person in the household means that everyone looks down on the top of my head.&nbsp; I was starting to get comments about the gray and mild references to skunks.&nbsp; So with that in mind I totally screwed up my hair.&nbsp;    &nbsp; 
I have always been a  urlLink Curly Girl  and had come to grips with my  urlLink naturally curly  hair. However, the addition of the gray stripe down my dome was bothering me.

  urlLink    

I decided to try  blending  the gray in by using  urlLink Frost and Tip . I slapped the cap on and did a minimal amount of hair. IT DID NOTHING but add a few stingy yellow highlights by my ears. No clue why it didn't take. So, I decided to give the  urlLink L'Oreal Colour Rays  a try. Figured that painting the highlights, this time in white-ish, would be better. Again - NADA. I got a few rank streaks in some weird-ass places is all. 

However, now my hair is  urlLink frizzy and fried  in a big way. BIG WAY is the operative phrase. I look like  urlLink Carrot Top  with streaks. It's sad. I mean - it's really, really  urlLink bad hair . The husband has informed me that I just need to break down, not be so cheap and go to the  urlLink salon  to get it fixed. Caramba. I know I should but hate the thought of it. I know I need it fixed but am afraid of coming out of there with another raggedy old  urlLink Shag , or worse yet - a  urlLink Mullet  !!!!!!

Any suggestions or submissions will be greatly appreciated. Put "BAD HAIR" in the subject line.

Thank you for letting me whine.

       &nbsp;    HOT TIME SUMMER IN THE CITY     urlLink    
   Phoenix News   

 urlLink Valley is really cookin' but not like last year . It isn't what you want to hear, not with the office thermostat set at 82 degrees and the threat of rolling blackouts. But as hot as it was out there, nearly record-tying hot on Wednesday, it was not as hot as last year. Wednesday's high of 111 degrees - which was hot, don't let anyone tell you otherwise - fell 1 degree short of the record for the day. But last summer was worse. The average high temperature through the first 21 days of July last year was 110.6 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. This year, the average through Wednesday was just over 106 degrees. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory on Wednesday in part because of the heat and humidity combination. Today's forecast calls for more of the same, with a high near 112, but the big high-pressure system that's cooking the state will shift a little by Friday and conditions could moderate, with highs dropping below the 110-degree mark. There's also a 20 percent chance of a rain shower by late Friday. 
We are all trying to  urlLink stay cool with aesthetic movement . This is the interesting part: Ceiling fans with four blades will actually move more air than five blades, and three blades will move more air than four blades. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that the extra blade puts more load on the motor, so the revolutions per minute are fewer. Not much less but a bit. The reason most people prefer five-bladed fans is aesthetics, when most people are decorating, they seem to prefer groupings in odd numbers. OK, one last thing about ceiling fans. They cool you off by pushing air across your skin. If you aren't there, they aren't cooling anything. So save energy by turning them off when you're not in the room.
  
 urlLink 200-plus campaign TV ads per household . If yours is a metropolitan Phoenix household with "average" television-viewing habits, you've been subjected to more than 200 commercials touting John Kerry or George W. Bush in the early stages of their presidential campaigns, a study reveals. Phoenix, as the most populous market in a state counted among 21 that could prove crucial in the Nov. 2 general election, ranked 37th among 93 markets nationwide in the concentration of ads, according to a joint analysis by the Nielsen Monitor-Plus ratings organization and the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project. Democrat Kerry and three groups backing him with their own commercials outpaced President Bush's ad coverage in the Phoenix market by a 3-2 ratio, according to the study.   
 urlLink Arizona was al-Qaida hotbed . Osama bin Laden's top agent for procuring weapons of mass destruction was among several key al-Qaida figures who attended the University of Arizona or lived in Tucson during the 1980s and early 1990s, according to the Sept. 11 commission's final report, released Thursday. The highly anticipated 567-page report also refers to more than a dozen other individuals who lived in Arizona from the 1990s through Sept. 11, 2001, and who were targeted in terrorism investigations after hijackers smashed jetliners into the Pentagon and World Trade Center.

 urlLink Celebrities declare own war -- on Bush . In what's shaping up as one of the nastiest presidential races in decades, Bush-bashing is turning into an en vogue celebrity sport. But unsolicited anti-Bush rhetoric, which appears to be spinning out of control, is alienating both Republicans and Democrats.

Winding up her summer tour across Europe, Bonnie Raitt drew thunderous applause at the Stockholm Jazz Festival for dedicating a classic to President George Bush. "We're gonna sing this for George Bush because he's out of here, people!" Raitt crowed Tuesday night before she launched into the opening licks of "Your Good Thing (Is About to End)," a cover that was featured on her 1979 album, "The Glow."  
 
Here's a couple of guys speaking out: 
 
 urlLink Ice Cream Entrepreneur Totes Bush Effigy . The co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream is on the road, towing a 12-foot-tall effigy of President Bush with fake flames shooting out of the pants.  urlLink Ben Cohen  says it's an acceptable way to point out what he calls the president's lies. "In a polite society, you don't go up to a person and look at them in the face and say, 'You're a liar,'" Cohen said in a telephone interview before arriving in Spokane, the next stop on the Pants on Fire Tour. The tour began last November on Long Island, N.Y., and will continue until the Nov. 2 elections. It has been to Florida, Texas, Arizona and Colorado.

  RANT 'N RAVING IN THE FREE WORLD

   Wednesday   



Work was pretty busy. A lot of the year-round teachers and new teachers are coming back and getting set up. We kept pretty busy and that was good as it made the day go a lot faster. A lot of our dept. are taking their vacations or getting ready to take their vacations and this hurt my feelings big time. I am pretty frosted that I didn't get a request in before the rule about not taking time off around the beginning of school came down. Seems like I won't get to take any time this summer when everyone else is and it bugs me. 

  




Saw that the daughter was online most of the day since I can see her  urlLink AIM  on my  urlLink iBook  at work. She kept messaging me about what time her dance class was and what there was to eat, etc. So, when I came home and to get her for her 6 o'clock ballet class and found she hadn't unloaded the dishwasher or done any of the stuff we'd asked I was riled. I didn't even get a chance to pee before taking her to class and she took umbrage to me saying "you didn't unload the dishwasher like you were asked". 
  






Dropped her off and came home and unloaded the dishwasher and took out the recyle and the dirty trash that the son had been asked to do. I then went outside and swept the pool for the husband. The son came out mid-way in this process, dangled his big hair legs over the side of the pool and watched me. He said "you know Dad does that every night". I said I knew and now he wouldn't have to. Then he said "you look angry" and I said my neck hurt. He watched me until I got right up to the end then asked if I wanted him to do it. I told him at that point to forget it but it sure would have been nice if he'd volunteered when he saw me grimacing in pain as I did it. I also told him it would have been grand if he'd taken the trash out which he then said he didn't do because he wasn't ASKED. I told him that was bullshit and he got cheesed off. 
  






The husband then got home and flounced in the chair and slapped a goddam bag o' chips on his face like a feedbag again. I said that the daughter needed to be picked up at 7 and he went out back to start putzing at the time she had to be picked up so that's when I went to get her. Neither of the guys who heard me say she needed to be picked up at 7 offered to get her. I was not amused. 


  



Get down there and sat outside the studio in the car for about 10 minutes while the daughter is in there yakking away to her "dance friends". She was not even making an effort to see if I was out there waiting or to care. I then started to back out and drive away - figured I would teach her a lesson by leaving. She then saw THAT and ran out to get in the car and asked what I was doing and I told her that I didn't have all night to wait for her. Then turned on my  urlLink Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World  
- just to annoy her. (she hates Neil Young) So on the way home she proceeded to tell me what a bad attitude I had and how I had been "pissy" since I got home. Then she said "I get the computer when we get home". I asked her what she needed it for and she said  urlLink AIM . I told her fine - not up for the fight over it and that really riled her piles. Brat. 


  




Went out in the kitchen and heated up some  urlLink Old El Paso taco meat , some shells, shredded lettuce and got some cheese and slapped all that on the table for them with 3 plates. Told them dinner was ready and they were all skippy over that. Then they say there was no place set for me and they asked if was eating and I said no. They asked why and I said I didn't feel like it. I sat outside and watched the lovely sunset while they ate. When they finished I went in and cleaned up the kitchen since the bastards can't handle the nuances of that either. 

  





The daughter THEN told me that my father called around 5 and is still having computer problems and wanted me to go up there tomorrow to fix it and he would buy us lunch. She said he would call back around 8. She then turned on  urlLink MTV  to watch  urlLink Yellowcard  in concert WHILE she chatted on the computer. The son came out and said he was going to the movies with The girlfriend to see "  urlLink Napolen Dynamte  " which he had promised his sister he would take her to see. She got upset that he would see it without her and before her and he then said he would take her some other time. Yeah right. 
  






Of course since it was 8 p.m. the husband decided to start working on the bathroom. Typical. I got ready for bed, took a muscle relaxant and waited for my father to call - which he did right on time. He's frustrated and I will be going up there tomorrow around 11 and then he will take me and the daughter (if she goes) to lunch or he will pay me. I would rather have the cash but whatever. Just thrilled to death to go do my job on my day off for him. He wants me to explain it to him as I do it so it will mean screaming in his good ear while I troubleshoot the bitch. I would rather be shot. Truly, it's not going to be any fun at all. The man simply can't handle the  urlLink Windows XP  and I would like to string up the dork who talked him into that.  urlLink Windows 98  was so much easier for him to deal with. It ought to be a real circus. 


  




So I hit the hay at 8:30 while the husband was pounding and rattling around in the bathroom until about 2 a.m. Not sure WTF he was doing since it looks NO different today. Whatever. I have resigned myself to the fact it won't be done for a couple months and I will live with it. I am NOT going to bitch about it. 
  





   THURSDAY   







I have no clue why I am not losing weight. I do the  urlLink Gazelle , the weights, eat fruit and salad for breakfast and lunch. I am cutting way back in the evenings too and not grazing. I have probably cut around 300 calories or more from my intake and I am working out which is suppossed to be burning it right? I know I am toning and perhaps building muscle but c'mon - the muscle is not THAT heavy. It's hurting my feelings. I do think the  urlLink Phase 2  before meals w/ carbs and just cutting back on the "bad carbs" has helped get rid of the gut fat. I don't feel as bloated as I was. I am still carrying some baggage around the arms, upper hips and hamhocks. 

  





Well, my work day was relatively slow until the end. One of the Office Managers from the year-round schools called with a list of 14 new teachers, teachers who had moved rooms and teachers who had left. This came in about 3. René and I split those names up and busting a move putting them on the server, putting them in and taking them out of the addressbook and our Remedy system and writing up work orders to have their voice mail cleared. We were cranking from around 3:30 to 5:30. I guess it was a good thing for it made that last couple hours sail by. We were glad to leave the joint knowing we won't do 10 hours again this year. We go back to 8 hours 5 days a week on Monday. Of course from the looks of things we will be busy. However, I did have to enter one name that got me laughing like a hyena - I was slappy. Get this - his name is Daryl Blowers. His logon name and e-mail address will be dblower Can you handle it? DBLOWER! 
  






Came home in still a bit of a snit. I had swung by  urlLink Wag's  and got my meds, some shampoo, body wash, body wash, soda and cigs. I drive up and the recycle bin was still on the curb - no one had deemed the task worthy enough of bringing it back to the carport like it should be. Came in and there were dirty dishes stacked in the sink - even though the dishwasher was dirty. Didn't feel that task worth of their efforts either. I got inside from schlepping the bin back up to the carport and loading the dishwasher. The son ran out when he heard me unloading the  urlLink Wag's  bag expecting there to be more groceries than that. The daughter proceeded to try and SUCK UP to boot. I was very quiet - hadn't said word one to them. They asked "what's wrong?". I told them "nothing - what the hell do I have to be upset about? " That sent the son to his room to sulk and the daughter went to get ready for dance. I had decided I was not going to get into it with them for they obviously wanted that. I was going to be MUM and do what I needed to do. No Nagging. Well, as I am driving The daughter to dance she started yapping saying "I don't know what happened to you at work or if you are still pissed about last night but whatever it is I DIDN'T DO IT and I am not going to get a guilt trip over whatever it is". I didn't say one word back. NADA. Zip. After about 5 minutes she finally said "I am sure you think it's my fault and I'm sorry for whatever it is ok?". Again - I said nothing. We go the studio in silence and I said I would see her at 8:30. 


  




Came home and did the same to The husband and The son. They would ask "what's wrong?" to which I would reply "nothing is wrong". Then they would ask why I wasn't saying anything to which I replied I had nothing to say. That shut them both up big time. LOL 




  


Went and got The daughter at 8:30 and came home and made some frozen  urlLink Birdseye Voila  stuff with 13g of carbs per serving - Garlic Chicken and Vegetables. Microwaved that up and slapped it on the table. I did eat with them but didn't talk much. I think they got the drift when after dinner I loaded up the dishwasher, wiped the table down and ran the damned washer. I am sick of nagging them and if they can't see what needs to be done then fuck them and I just need to ignore myself and do it. Accept it. Not worth the fight over who will help me. If it doesn't get done and the place goes to shit - so be it. I will do what I can and anyone who wants to help is free to do so and gets the cash and prizes. If you don't - your loss. Not nagging anymore - it's too exhausting. 

  






   FRIDAY   






Up earlier than I had liked thanks to the  urlLink hounds  who decided that since the husband was up getting ready for work then by golly I should be up too! Bastards. Beau wallowing on top of me on the bed and Dixie with her head laying on the mattress right next to my dome, breathing down my face and whimpering - what a morning greeting that was! LOL 



  




So I am going up to My parent’s around 11. I dread it. If My father wants me to explain it then he's going to sitting there with me screaming into his good ear. Shit - it's a regular busman's holiday. I just hope he didn't pooch the sucker too badly. I had it working slick on Sunday - really I did. Then going to LUNCH with them. Cripes - the fun never ends does it? Shit. I will be coming home RIGHT after lunch - no shopping with Mom or anything like that. I want to take a damned nap. LOL

That ought to fire up the Dems and maybe inject some much needed FIGHT into the base! 
  


 urlLink No Computer for Kerry As He Writes Speech  Kerry said he writes in long hand, then cuts and pastes pieces of the speech to reorganize his thoughts. He uses old-fashioned scissors and glue, not the computer keystrokes modern writers are accustomed to. "I find that this" — he moves his fingers like he's typing on an imaginary keyboard — "somehow becomes the concentration. ... It interrupts the flow for me." Kerry says he'll continue working on the speech during a long weekend at his family's beachfront home on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts. "The sea is important to me," he said. "I get a lot out of being close to it. It's my connection. It's where I've always been. It's where I get a peace of mind and creativity." 

  




 urlLink Mrs. Clinton Will Be in Boston, but Not at the Microphone . It is not exactly clear why Mrs. Clinton was not on the list. But Democrats familiar with the situation said the answer was simple: she did not ask to speak, while other officials did. It has already been announced that former Presidents Carter and Clinton will be speaking that evening.  urlLink Dems pick Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano to speak at convention  July 27, joining Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and others who will talk about Sen. John Kerry's and Sen. John Edwards' "service to the nation and fight for the average American," convention officials announced. It also signals the first-term governor's emerging visibility on the national scene.

 urlLink Kerry's speech to NAACP digs at Bush . Kerry, taking advantage of a spat between the NAACP and the White House, accused President Bush on Thursday of dividing America by race and wealth, and promised as president to represent “all of the people." The president may be too busy to talk to you,” Kerry told the partisan crowd, “but I have news for you: He’s going to have plenty of time after Nov. 2.” Kerry said he is “going to the homes of ordinary citizens across this nation and talking with them about the values that matter most to them — values you live by every day — family, responsibility, service, opportunity, inclusion, fairness, faith.” 

  
 urlLink Kerry Didn't Read Iraq Report Before Vote . "Along with other senators, he was briefed on the contents of the NIE (National Intelligence Estimate) by (then-CIA Director) George Tenet and other administration intelligence officials," said Kerry spokesman Phil Singer. Kerry's campaign has challenged Bush to say whether he read the complete intelligence report before deciding to go to war, or whether he just read a one-page summary, which Democrats say gave him none of the dissenting views included in the full version. The Kerry campaign stepped up the attack on Wednesday, sending out an e-mail with the headline, "Did anyone in the White House read the full National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq?" 
  

 urlLink CIA's Acting Chief Says Threat Highest Since 9/11 . The terrorist threat against the United States in the run-up to the November election is as serious as at any time since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, acting CIA Director John McLaughlin said on Tuesday. "This is about as serious a threat environment as I have seen since 9/11," said McLaughlin, the deputy director. "The quality of the information we have now is such that we have high confidence that the nation needs to be on guard," McLaughlin told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
  
 urlLink U.S. Treasury says likely to hit debt limit in Oct  . The U.S. government will likely reach its federal debt limit in early October, a top Treasury official said in written remarks, giving fresh details on when the politically sensitive ceiling will need to be raised. The $7.384 trillion debt limit may need attention before the November election, Timothy Bitsberger, Treasury's nominee for assistant secretary for financial markets, said in a document obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. 
  
 urlLink Group: 6M May Lose Overtime Protection . Disputing Bush administration estimates, a labor-backed think tank said Wednesday that new federal rules will remove overtime protections for at least 6 million U.S. workers. The study by the Economic Policy Institute was released a day after three former Labor Department officials said in a report requested by the AFL-CIO that "large numbers" of employees entitled to overtime would no longer get it when the new rules take effect Aug. 23.

 urlLink More rain possible; hundreds still have no power . The first monsoon thunderstorm of the year dumped nearly 2 inches of rain on the Valley Tuesday night, and damaged at least four homes while cutting power to nearly 15,000 residents. About 9,500 APS customers suffered outages ranging from a few minutes to several hours, said spokesman Alan Bunnell. About 1,500 homes in central Phoenix from Bethany Home to McDowell roads and 35th Avenue to 28th Street are still without power. (whew - dodged that bullet by about 3 miles!)

 urlLink Kerry, Edwards Begin First Campaign Swing . An upbeat John Kerry campaigned for the first time with running mate John Edwards on Wednesday and boasted that the Democratic team has a "better vision, better ideas" than its Republican counterpart - and joked, "we've got better hair." They challenge  urlLink President Bush: Flip-Flopper-In-Chief  on a high note.  urlLink  Voters Like VP Choice  .  A majority of all voters, and seven in ten Democrats, say they are glad that Edwards was chosen. Only one in ten think Kerry should have named someone else. By more than two to one, voters think Edwards has the right experience to be a good vice president, though many are not sure he has enough experience to be a good president.  urlLink Tough Talk, Banter Kick Off 4-Man Campaign . President Bush on Wednesday curtly dismissed freshman Sen. John Edwards' credentials to be vice president while Democratic challenger John Kerry and his running mate rallied voters in battleground states. "Dick Cheney can be president," Bush declared, and Kerry suggested that was part of the problem. "He doesn't have a record to run on, he's just got a record to run away from, and he's attacking everyone," Kerry said of Bush. He said Edwards has "more experience and better judgment than George Bush when he became president." Bush was in his second term as Texas governor.  
Even our ol' pal  urlLink  Nader approves of Kerry's pick .  Last February on “Hardball,” MSNBC’s Chris Matthews asked Ralph Nader who he wanted to see running against George W. Bush on the Democratic ticket. He said then, “Kerry and Edwards is better than Bush.”

Lay, who insists he knew nothing of any wrongdoing and was misled by underlings, was taken away with his hands cuffed behind him to be charged.  
However, in related news  urlLink The Nation's Liberals Suffering From Outrage Fatigue . 
According to a study released Monday by the Hammond Political Research Group, many of the nation's liberals are suffering from a vastly diminished sense of outrage.
"With so many right-wing shams to choose from, it's simply too daunting for the average, left-leaning citizen to maintain a sense of anger," said Rachel Neas, the study's director. "By our estimation, roughly 70 percent of liberals are experiencing some degree of lethargy resulting from a glut of civil-liberties abuses, education funding cuts, and exorbitant military expenditures."
Of the liberals afflicted with fatigue, many said they are still haunted by the specters of their former outrage.

"I can't even look at the back of my Volvo anymore," said one Syracuse, NY liberal who wished to remain anonymous. "My 'Lick Bush' and 'Four More Wars' bumper stickers just remind me of the angry feelings I can't sustain. I still have a MoveOn.org sign hanging up in my cubicle at work, but if someone starts to talk about Cheney, I can't take it. I'm like, 'Yes, we all hate Cheney. He's an evil puppet-master. Yes, Bush is dumb. This is obvious. How many times can we say it? Now, excuse me, will you let me through so I can microwave my burrito?'"

        urlLink      urlLink Substation fire poses blackout threat in Phoenix  . Phoenix faces the threat of rolling blackouts on Wednesday after a fire at a major power substation reduced the amount of electricity that could be moved into the city, a utility spokesman said. "So far, we have managed to avoid any involuntary curtailments but we are in a very tight situation and tomorrow (Wednesday) will be even tighter," Alan Bunnell, a spokesman for utility Arizona Public Service, said on Tuesday. Bunnell said the utility was "having an aggressive conservation push" in a bid to avert rolling blackouts with temperatures in Phoenix seen climbing to around 109 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday. The fire broke out at the West Wing substation in the metropolitan Phoenix area on Sunday. It took until late Tuesday evening to totally control the blaze and put it out. The substation is operated and partly owned by APS, a unit of Pinnacle West Capital Corp. . The other part-owner is another Phoenix-based utility, Salt River Project. For the rest of the week the  urlLink Valley faces power pinch . Residents and businesses can brace themselves for weeks - maybe months - of voluntary power conservation and possible blackouts as a result of a massive fire at a power substation near Sun City. Governments are instructing employees to turn up the thermostats and turn off the lights. Businesses appear to be following suit. Tuesday passed without any forced outages, but supply was tight for parts of the day, said Alan Bunnell, an APS spokesman. He cautioned that there will be more challenges as power demands rise today, Thursday and Friday. 
 urlLink What to expect if blackouts are forced : 
•  No advanced warning.  Although the power companies will attempt to publicize the fact that outages will occur, you will not be able to find out if or when your neighborhood will be hit. 


•  Won't last long.  The outages would last 30 to 60 minutes for APS customers and about 20 minutes for Salt River Project customers. 


•  During peak hours.  The power companies expect the outages to occur during peak usage hours, which are 4 to 6 p.m. 


•  Sporadic.  The power companies would cut electricity one circuit at a time in different areas around the Valley. APS says each circuit serves about 1,000 customers. It is possible that one neighbor would have power and another wouldn't. But customers would not be hit by more than one outage per day. 


•  Food won't spoil.  Department of Health Services officials advise keeping refrigerators and freezers closed. But food in the fridge is usually OK up to two hours without electricity. Freezer food can last even longer. 


•  Don't panic.  Health officials don't expect outages in the half-hour range to seriously affect people's health. They advise residents to stay inside, drink ice water, relax, not engage in a lot of physical activity and keep windows and doors closed to keep cool air inside. 


•  Drive carefully.  Traffic lights would go out in areas affected by outages.

 urlLink Bands Gather to Stump Against Bush . More than 20 musical acts — including Bruce Springsteen , Pearl Jam and the Dixie Chicks — will perform fund-raising concerts one month before the Nov. 2 election in an effort to unseat President Bush. Other artists participating in the shows include hip-hoppers Jurassic 5, John Mellencamp , Bonnie Raitt , Jackson Browne , Babyface, Bright Eyes and the Dave Matthews Band. Springsteen said he didn't fear any backlash over going public with his personal politics. "It's a pretty clear-cut decision in November," said Springsteen, whose songs have provided a backdrop for some Kerry events. "We're chipping in our two cents. That's all we're trying to do."

Hey, that's great, you know [for] corporate bigwigs, wealthy, well-to-do guitar players, but we've also watched services get cut, after-school programs for people that need it the most, we've watched rollback on environmental regulations, and a foreign policy that I think put at risk the lives of the very bravest young men and women under what ended up to be discredited circumstances.

What I do believe is I believe that John Kerry and John Edwards — I don't think they have all the answers, but right now for the problems we have, I haven't seen anybody who does …. "

 My neice invited me to a party on Saturday night. She's a sweet 20-something gal. The invitation said it would be a "women's party". I figured it would be the typical margarita and candle/kitchen gadget party they always have so I told her I would be there. I show up and find out it's a  urlLink Passion Party ! Good lord. There sit a bunch of 20-somethings and my sisters-in-law while some housewife explains and shows us different types of  urlLink dildos .  UNREAL.  I was trying to be polite and not make snide comments but it was hard. (no pun intended)  What really floored me was how the ENTIRE group went wild over the  urlLink Jack Rabbit Vibrator  .  WTF?  My sisters-in-law were filling out order forms for hundreds of dollars of marital aids.  It was surreal at best.  I ordered the minimal amount of body salt scrub and glittery lotion but NO marital aids to their chagrin.  I just found it strange that the neice would invite her mother and aunts to this party.  There are certain things you really don't want to know about people.  It was just weird to be sitting there drinking a margarita watching women go wild over this stuff.  Maybe it's because I had a  urlLink Hysterectomy  a couple years ago - but this kind of stuff just didn't excite me at all.

   HOW MANY POLLS DOES IT TAKE TO GET A BOUNCE?   
  urlLink     
 The "bounce".  Everyone has been talking about the bounce that Kerry needed from the convention.  However, true to form it's a mess.  urlLink Polls Mixed on Kerry Post-Convention Gain  - no really?  What a surprise.  First we hear that  urlLink Kerry-Edwards leads by five points over Bush-Cheney  . Then to confuse it more we have the registered vs. "likely: voter numbers by the  urlLink Gallup Poll  .  THEN add more confusion by the  urlLink ABCNEWS Poll  Which shows a tepid bounce for Kerry. From what I read in all of these it seems that Kerry gained five to eight points among registered voters on issues and attributes alike, while Bush lost about as many. And after a convention that focused heavily on his military experience in Vietnam, Kerry leads Bush as 'better qualified to be commander-in-chief,' by 52 percent to 44 percent. But who really knows?  They are keeping us afraid by issuing terror alerts and suggesting that those of us unhappy should just go on  urlLink Prozac .  It's enough to make me want to get a  urlLink CyberTan  and go ahead and get a  urlLink a new identity .  Let's let them campaign, debate and let us vote.  Enough already.
