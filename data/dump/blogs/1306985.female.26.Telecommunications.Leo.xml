        i changed my blogspot address...my original reason was i don't want him to be updated with my activities anymore. coz its like, he's there watching me from a distance and im inside a glass or something.   seesh!and what i hated most is that it is quite obvious that he doesn't want to communicate with me. like i emailed him and asked how he was...he would just reply that he's ok and was sorry he wasn't calling or writing.i even called him...last week of may. we talked for a maximum of 4 or 5 minutes only. i felt excited to talk to him but at his end...i dunno!   i kinda confirmed that he IS deliberately avoiding me. i read his blog for last week and he wrote it there. not communicating so that "things won't get complicated". i rest my case.   it saddens me...but im still hoping. i'll just pray for him and for everything that is happening right now to both of us.

      Guys tell: What matters most   By Matthew Sakey        For all their similarities, guys also display great variance. As satisfying as it would be to cynically insist that every man on earth is interested only in willingness to copulate, bust size, leg length and sympathy to scheduling issues during football season (in that order), it's not a fair judgment. Many qualities guys look for are intangible, so if you're in the market, be advised that most men value these features above all others.   1. Tolerance This is often interpreted as "sympathy to scheduling issues during football season," but it's really much broader than that. Guys like what they like â€” whatever that may be, and it will certainly differ from guy to guy â€” and though they might make an effort to respect your feelings about their pastimes and viewpoints, they're not likely to change them for you. Guys want to be with women who don't roll their eyes when they head out to play D&D or insist that a visit to the shoe store is more important than hockey playoffs. Respect their idiosyncrasies and they'll respect yours.   2. Compatibility with friends His friends aren't necessarily going to become your friends, but you need to be able to stand their presence. In fact, it would help if you like them a little, always remembering that they are his friends, so a certain boundary needs to be respected. There will be times when he wants to be with them rather than you, and if you like them it'll help clarify why. Similarly, a guy's friends and his relationship do not fill the same section of his heart: he needs both, and prefers when they fit together comfortably.   3. Honesty and decency Men don't like being cheated on or lied to any more than women do. If you're a chew 'em up and spit 'em out type, your life will be a string of one-night stands followed by a bitter spinsterhood. You man must feel he can trust you without question, and it is your behavior that will ensure he does.   4. Independence This is a tricky one, and it doesn't apply to every man in the wild, but there's a good chance he prefers to be with someone who can own and operate their daily lives. The complaint that he needs his "space" when a relationship sours is actually an indication that he feels constricted by your failure to manage your own affairs and respect his occasional need for privacy. You made it to adulthood without him; surely you can continue being self-sufficient now.   5. Comprehension of differences Men, being from Mars, think before they feel. When men discuss problems, they do not commiserate, they offer solutions. This creates a huge communication gap in relationships, because a woman wants emotional support while the guy uncomprehendingly suggests a resolution. Neither side is right or wrong, but women are hard wired to be feelers and men are hard wired to be thinkers. Understanding that he is not being callous or short when he tells you what he thinks rather than what he feels will score you lots of points.   Men are complicated beasts, and it's no wonder that women still struggle to figure out what motivates them. We're all people, but there are some fundamental differences, and equally fundamental misconceptions, in what each gender wants from the other. But men aren't the shallow goobers they're sometimes made out to be, and giving them the benefit of the doubt in this will mean lots of potential mates from which to choose.

       i can't believe that things would turn out this way for me...i try not to think negatively about the situation but i can't help it. ok, maybe im just feeling bad about nothing. i might be over reacting. hey,i don't want to shout or what. but i just feel so bad already. as if nothing happened! ok,so he might be "too busy" with his "new life" right now. and obviously, im not even a part of his so-called "new life" now.   evaluating everything that i've done in the past: i wasn't quiet aggressive nor complacent. a couple of times,i've been forward (but in a good way, i guess). coz it's really obvious that he needs a little pushing or shove from his side. and i believe i let him out a little. (which im really happy about) i've been honest with myself and to him all the time.

          hi! i was suppose to write you a letter and send it to you there but i read your blog the other day and you've transferred na pala.   anyways, i really wanted it written coz email seems impersonal (just for this particular one).   i really don't know where to begin....   the past few months, i admit that i really felt sad. we've lost touch. i don't know if its just me but i really felt that you've been avoiding me.almost all of the time, im the one who would initiate the first move to email you.maybe you have your reasons like you're just too busy adjusting to your new life there and looking for a job and preparing coz you'll be moving out to your new home. so i tried to understand you.   i really don't want to make you think that im pushing myself too much on you.that i could be this "bitch" bugging you all the time and being nosy as well. i gave you space.i continued reading your blogs and honestly you got me worried when you mentioned that you're not doing "good" in this adjustment phase.you seem to have doubts,apprehensions,regrets (maybe) and other "mixed" emotions about this transition that you're in right now.   and as your friend, i do empathize with you coz i have been in this stage also just recently.i was just ahead of you for a couple of months.but in those months that i was out of work,no income,far from home...i felt like giving up.i did feel down most of the time and also depressed.maybe im just good in hiding and dealing with it.you never knew about it nor did my closest friends and my family.instead of sulking and surrendering, i fought back.you ask where i got my strength? 1)my family and friends who believe in me 2)my drive to reach my ambition 3)you.   those days when i was just in my aunt's apartment&nbsp;still waiting for news of our canada trip and at the same time trying to find a job here in manila...i was really&nbsp;so confused and very lost&nbsp;and i felt like my life IS going down.i hurriedly resigned from my job of 5 yrs and i left my home (family and friends) with such a short notice.im in the starting line again...starting from scratch...new environment away from home.i was so used to my life back home that what i did (of leaving it all) was such a big leap.and when i was faced with the reality that our trip will not push through after all..i somehow panicked.what will i do?there is no job waiting for me back home...i have to find one soon.there were bills to pay and i have to&nbsp;contribute with my aunt's apartment also.   but all these time...you never heard me&nbsp;talking about this...or me complaining or worrying or whatever...honestly,everytime we talked during those times i felt very happy and relieved...you were like my refuge...talking to you made me forget about the "storm" i was going through...   when i would have problems,i would try my best to solve it on my own...i&nbsp;never share my worries with other people (especially my family) coz i don't want other people to worry about me...i tell myself that i can handle it...coz i really believe that God would never give us any problems we cant solve.all the answers are there...we just have to look for it and along the way we should be sensitive and patient in searching for the answers.   with all these things im sharing with you right now...you ask: where is these all&nbsp;going?   ok...honestly, right now, i just feel so angry with you & myself. why? coz of the fact that you are "shutting" me off (again). i ask myself what did i do to deserve this kind of treatment from you? if your memory serves you right...you did this to me before...again...if i just let my "maldita" me get in the way...hindi na rin kita papansinin...and i just want to reiterate again...i don't want to do this to you coz i know you don't deserve this kind of treatment from me...i don't want to lose a friend nor do i want to gain an enemy in the process...but im just so hurt with all your "cold treatment".   i dont want to nag or anything...i just want you to know how ive been feeling in the last months...there is never a day that i dont think of you and how you are coping with the phase you're in now...   i really feel bad also coz when i sent you some forwarded emails where you have to answer it...you do answer it...BUT you don't answer MY personal email to you...and what really ticked me off the other day was...you even have a&nbsp;second (not even a minute) to post that "..." comment in myspace.com. again, i ask you:what was that suppose to mean??? and fyi (even if you ask me or not/if you care or not) he IS not my boyfrient (right he is NOT) but my coworker who is not even my close gf (girlfriend) at work but IS my gf (GAYfriend)...yup!he IS so gay!!!more girly that me for that matter...   honesty...honesty...i really cant explain it but ive grown to connect with you way back and in truth, ive learned to love you in some way also...thats why it really hurts me so much right now to see whats happening between us....   i just feel&nbsp;really, really&nbsp;sad if ill lose you as a friend...as ive said&nbsp;before...boyfriends or girlfriends or even husbands or wives get separated but once you've found a true friend...they will be with you for life and accept you for what you are...   sometimes i tell myself..."bakit ko pa pagsisiksikan ang sarili ko to a person who doesn't want me...when there are still a lot of&nbsp;people out there who would want to have me for their friend"...again rich...i just want to save our friendship...   i don't expect you to answer me back anymore...bahala ka na...this will be my last email for now and i wont even bother you with my forwarded emails as well...im not really&nbsp;locking my door to you...i would just close it for now coz it appears that im not yet welcome in your life...   lastly...salamat talaga for all the calls and talks we had before...i did look forward to&nbsp;it everytime...thanks a lot for listening and talking to me....i really appreciate it...thank you again....as&nbsp;always...you take care of yourself...&nbsp;

       almost everyday, especially when im alone, i keep on thinking about him. ha! and i don't even try to think if he is also thinking about me or not. the fact is,i am just so worried about him and his situation right now. i'm so torn with the idea of just leaving him alone and giving him a time out or if i should call or email him or send him a card.(now i think ill send him an e card instead)   if i give him time off...the question is:until when? if i do write him...well,it would rather be a very long one. it would be some sort of a "goodbye-for-now-until-you're- stable-or-fine-with-yourself" type of letter. basically, i just want to be honest with him and be frank.   geez! i just try to calm myself most of the time when i try to think about all these. coz there is a part of me that seems to be angry with him and another part kept telling me to be a rational being, be patient and just let it be.   time IS of the essence, i believe. but then again, i don't want him to think that im like "meddling so much" with his life.   LIFe is truly unfair and who says its not complicated?

       i don't want to close my doors to him or anything. i'm still hoping against hope that everything will turn out positive. i'll continue to wait. whenever...whatever.... i really don't want to turn my back on him. my options will still be open. anything could happen. i just want to be prepared for any eventually. but for now, life goes on....

      the week that was...had a good start on the 24th...got so mad at work on the 25th, that i was "literally" shouting at the top of my lungs explaining to my superiors 'coz they think i'm doing the wrong thing with my work.  didn't report for work on the 26th.  my alibi: LBM 'coz i changed the milk that i was drinking.  hehe for them...  i just stayed home, watched tv and slept.  grouchy all day at work on the 27th.  take note: i was snobbing one of my superiors and didn't eat lunch with him.  i felt so mad for what they told me the other day that i felt so depressed...so i bought six new fabrics and went to my maninay lou to have it made.  yippy, she finished my dress (which was with her last december) and wore it today at work.  TGIF!  issah and i went to pay our last respects to mrs. juventina maypa.(RIP)  she used to be the student aid directress in la salle.  so that would mean she's in charge of all the scholars in the university.  its the first time i had a major "clash" with my junior officer since he was assigned in our branch.  actually, i never thought that i would have an argument with sir miko ever.  he seemed so approachable and he's like a big brother to us at the branch.  but that day, i just felt exhausted of explaining to them 'coz all i'm saying seems to fall on deaf ears.  even if i turn the world up side down, my explanations are futile.  as if!!! as if i stole money or something!!!it was just a matter of my good judgement, fast decision-making, gut-feeling and riskless-self that bugged them that afternoon.  they reprimanded me 'coz i just did the transaction without informing them.  of course, i directly informed our manager 'coz i know if i ask them they won't approve it.  i could really feel myself getting red and the heat rising to my head while i explained at the top of my voice.  i completely lost my appetite (i was eating pandesal and pork bar-b-que)  i didn't feel anything afterwards.  i just frowned while finishing my transaction that afternoon and i immediately went out of the bank by 5:30 pm.    to hell with them!!!  i have my pride too...as if they can ask favors from the other staff?  if they wanted something done..all of them ask for my help...but me?i solve it by myself..to the point that i would sometimes try my best to find all the possible solutions but if its useless...that's when i would consult them. (but these are just very rare cases 'coz most of the time, i do solve it on my own).  not that i'm exagerrating or something, but its really true that all of them rely on me for help.  hmmp!  thanks to me and if not for me, they would be so LOST!  they will have their day!!! lintik lang ang walang ganti!

      we had an outing yesterday with my co-employees at the bank.  we went to Guintubdan, La Carolota.  it was the first time for most of us.  we trekked for the falls.  it was a 30 minute or so walk.  we were all catching our breaths.  whew!  but we made it.  the water was chilly ice.  you can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness.  we only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls.  another 30 minutes of trekking.  but the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking.  its like you can hear yourself being one with nature.  soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth.  the cold air and water were enough to make you be lulled to sleep.  after the trip, we went back to the pavilion and prepared lunch.  i felt sleepy.  so while waiting for lunch, i slept. (one of my officer's supervised the cooking so all of us girls just waited, hehe!)  food trip...tilapia, squid, bangus, pork bbq, grilled pork, tinolang manok, ripe mangoes and watermelon.  fiesta to the max.    all of us girls stayed in the pavilion the rest of the afternoon while the boys trekked to another waterfalls.  just enjoyed looking at the scenery since the pavilion overlooked some parts of negros.  even mount kanlaon was visible already.     we used a different route when we went back to bacolod.  it was the first time i felt proud to be born in negros.  why?  because we are a hundredtimes better than cebu and manila in terms of abundant trees.  our mountains still have a lot of greens in them.  i especially loved the pine trees.  its as if i was in baguio.  even the zigzag roads were like that of canon road too.  (fyi, i haven't been to baguio but its just the ones i see on tv)  we passed buenos aires in ma-ao.  the last stop was in our manager's poulty farm.  we enjoyed the fresh eggs picking.  each of us had a dozen eggs to take home.  yippy!!!  sigh!!  the day was very tiring but very fun indeed.  i got a tan too.  our next outing will be on april 9...salvador benedicto.  looking forward to it.

      last monday, march 10, apple (she works in the treasury dept. of our bank) has been bugging me to apply for a position in our treasury dept.  she wants me to take her place.  why? coz she's not happy there anymore.  besides, her present position requires her to undergo the officership training program and she doesn't want to become an officer either.  i have no problem deciding.  of course, i'll apply but what kept me back was having to ask my bos' approval on the matter.  so i kept postponing it and told apple that i'll hand in my application tomorrow.  so this afternoon, i asked my manager.  good thing he accepted it nicely and even saying that "much as he would like to keep me with the branch", he also wanted me to advance in my career and have my own job growth also.  i was so relieved afterwards.  thank god.  so tomorrow, i'll let him sign my application.      i pray that i'll get the position.  it would really be a breather for me after 5 years of staying in the branch.  a new direction and a new environment.  i'll be able to understand the banking process in a different perspective.

      got nothing to do...so i was just opening my old emails.  last feb 19, richie n. informed me (thru email) of his online diary website.  it was such a long time since i heard from him (or got an email for that matter).  i didn't try to view that website up until tonight.  right!...coz i've got nothing to do.  this site is kinda cool and so i signed up too. :)  thanks to richie.  i have always loved writing my thoughts.  high school...had my diary.  college...didn't write that much but i kept a journal too.  and when i browse through those books, i would find myself smiling (and sometimes laughing) for it indeed had my out-of-this world thoughts, feelings, views, or opinions.  my work involves a lot of writing and at the end of the day my fingers hurt or get tired already.  so i kinda stopped the writing stuff.  typing is no problem for me.  i'd be better off typing than let me write for that matter.  so this explains why i'll have fun writing here.  since we are in the "IT" or "NET" age or whatever you call it, this site is surely a blessing.  :)  no more paper to write on.  more trees to save (yippy!).  you can even share this to your friend who is living in the other side of the world.  privacy?  well, i have nothing to hide nor do i have any millions.  so i guess nobody out there would be interested in having this site monitored or something.  hehe!  just something i'll enjoy and have fun with.

      holy week..long vacation..already over...and where did i end up this time?  miriam,apple and i went to maricon's place in himamaylan..2 hr ride..160 km (more or less) away from bacolod.  ate and slept most of the time..while miriam and apple played tong-its and mahjong..i was either sleeping or dipping myself in the cute swimming pool (haha..its about 2 ft high, so i guess you can call it an oversized tub already).  the place is around 4 hectares most of which is the fish pond where they grow and breed bangus/tilapia/alimango/shrimp.  a lot of fruit trees like mango, santol, pineapple, banana, kasoy and many others surround the whole area.  sigh!the place is so quiet, calm, peaceful, relaxing..a little hot but thanks to the cool sea breeze..i already felt relieved.  if only i could stay their forever...you really get to "clear" your thoughts when you are in a place like that..that's why maricon's family call it paradise..it is PARADISE!  we get to take home a bagful of mangoes..its mango season right now..ill definitely go back there one of this days...thanks to maricon and her family..especially mama linda (her mom).

      just another huhum week for my simple life...  highlights....  had dinner with ronald and miriam last night.  we don't get to hang out with ronald anymore for a couple of months now since maricon (his wife) got pregnant.  she's in manila right now..being closely monitored by her obgyne. that's why ronald has to go to manila all the time..to be there for her.  sigh! we miss maricon so much...but we are very happy for both of them coz after 4 years..they're gonna have a baby..this baby is really a survivor..maricon already had two miscarriages..bless this child..we can't wait for her to be born...(right its a girl!)  shockingly,surprisingly,unexpectedly...richie called me last night. i thought it was dan coz before my celfone rang...i got a text message from him (actually, the message was sent..early part of the morning).  i used my postpaid number the whole day and when i got home, that's when i reverted to my prepaid number...i just remembered that..i emailed my number to richie before...touched by the effort that he kept it.  had a nice conversation with him and i sort of learned some things about the navy stuff or so...

        Though we’ve know each other for just a short while, I feel the sincere friendship you’ve shown me.  Thank you very much for the happy memories we had together. We may not see each other day by day, but our bond of friendship will surely remain.  Happy memories are always treasured. I pray that I’m a part of your happy memories.  Life is a constant change. I’m hoping that our friendship will still remain.  Your beautiful smile always lights up a gloomy face. Thanks for sharing your smile with me.  Smile, my friend and remember the good old times. Weren’t we happy and delighted of life’s simple pleasures?  People come and go… But friends stick together through thick and thin.  Rivers, valleys and mountains may set us apart… Yet, the happy moments will be treasured in my heart.  I like you very much… Can we be friends?  We laughed and cried, sang songs and talked about life… I never knew that our friendship could last this long.  We learn a lot from our mistakes. Thanks for correcting my errors.  It is really God’s will that we become friends. And I’m grateful to Him for your love and presence.  I hope that our friendship will go on though we may not see each other too often. Just remember our happy times together.  Smile and think of our happy moments together… Thank you for remembering me.  Friends bring out the best and the worst in me. Thanks for being my friend.  I feel secure and comfortable when you’re around. I hope this good vibration continues.  A common experience binds people together. I hope you’ll remember what we’ve gone through.  Friendship makes people belong. I’m glad to be a part of your circle of friends.  My dearest friend, may God continue to guide you all the days of your life. Never forget that I’m here, praying for your safety.  We’ve been through a lot of  ups and downs in life, my friend. I’m lucky to have known you all these years.  I’m sorry for hurting your feelings. I hope we can still be friends.  Friends become closer when they learn to forgive and forget. Thanks for your forgiveness.  Just dropping by to say, “hope you’re doing fine and you’re ok”. Miss you then, miss you now…I wish my message reaches you somehow.

      "all my life, i prayed for someone like you. and i thank god, that i finally found you."  kc and jojo...1998..its been awhile since i heard this song.  i just listened to it being played on the radio. i don't know why, but everytime i hear the song it still gives me that shiver and makes my heart skip and race...and....i dunno!!!one of my favorite songs... but the one which im kinda attached to...but i just want to remember the song...nothing more...coz the rest is history..that i don't want to dwell on, but one that i'm still thankful for until now.. even if i still regret my decisions but because of those decisions...my life had a different turn..it made me realize that there is always a reason for everything...

      it's like i'm back from a deep and long slumber...  ok..janis is going to boston,massachuset on the 15th..we will say our goodbyes to her on the 12th, when she's going to manila already with her sister and bro-in-law..i'm planning a last farewell gimik for her this saturday..dinner and all with cheng, rainier, llewelyn,roy (not sure if he'll go with us), tan-tan and geralyn...just thinking about it now makes me sad...i'm still in the stage of trying to accept the fact that one of my very best friends will be going out of the country soon...ya! i know she'll be back next year but its like a part of me will always be missing. janis and i have gone through a lot...we practically know each other's secrets and the little regretful things we did back then...i have always been the strong-willed person in our barkada..unlike janis..who is so good..you can't even tell if she's already mad with you or not..sometimes, i would even scold her for being so soft-hearted..when its already obvious that people are taking advantage of her kindness...i'm really going to miss scolding her...actually, i think not...she's just a phone call away...and of course, the email sermons from me will always reach her..haha!i'm gonna give her a very big and long hug when she leaves...i'll terribly miss her..god bless her out there..  nisa will be on maternity leave by next week..prepare myself...for 3 long months of doing everything in the new accounts..i'm programming myself not to expect help coz i know...i'll just be disappointed...i've done it once...and that was for almost 6 months...i can do it again!!!i'll live through this...i will!!!waaaaaahhhhh!!!!i'm praying that i'll be patient...all the way...

      One more month to go….  Time really flies.  Yup!  I deliberately avoided counting the days and even don’t look at any calendar for too long.  And before  I knew it…ha! A month has gone by already…yippy!!!  A lot of good things have happened at work.  For starters, last June 16, our newly-hired employee already started working.  Obviously, Irene had to help me out at the new accounts.  She learns fast.  I’m really impressed.  By the second day at work, she’s already opening most of the new accounts.  Minimal mistakes also…She catches up with everything that I taught her.  Hm?  Maybe I’m just a good teacher after all.  Haha!    Another good thing that’s going to happen at work…Irene will take my place.  Actually, I’m still going to be with the new accounts but I’ll be working in the backroom.  When Nisa comes back, Kristin (she’s a teller) and me, will be the new partners.  Not too much pressure anymore, unlike when I’m working in front of a lot people.  All of them wanting to be served all at once.  Our supervisors are done with our semi-annual ratings.  My, I’m so happy because I got an over-all rating of 97%.  If upper management will approve my rating, my boss recommended me for promotion from a level 2 to level 8.  Wow indeed!  As in like I literally “jumped” in my position level.  Well deserved..As they keep telling me.  Hehe! And even long overdue for that matter.  I’m really praying I’ll get it.  My Saturday classes already started.  Good thing I know someone inside the class.  At least I’ll have a buddy when group works and projects come in.

      life is indeed a roller coaster of events...  happiness times two last wednesday...Dan's box and janis' letter arrived.  I really appreciate Dan’s thoughtfulness…he sent me all these stuffed toys, chocolates and foodstuff, camping mattress, ‘hawaiian-inspired’ fabrics, scented candles, lotion and cologne, van gogh’s starry night, a hard-bound journal, picture frame, bag, cap, a tshirt for me and my bro, brain teaser game, and an accessory toy where you can make bracelets, earrings and necklaces made of colored paper patterns (which I gave to my cousin).  I shared the chocolates with my friends and will give some of the stuffed toys to my two inaanak.  Dan is really so good to me…I can’t seem to measure up with all the kindness he has shown me…  Janis sent me a letter with pictures of Boston… downtown area and Harvard university.  She’s not yet working since she still has to take the nclex.  however, there is still no scheduled exam yet…so all she does there is study… she misses us a lot and would cry… but, she’s holding on… I’ll  write her tomorrow.  Thursday… I was fighting back the tears, but I can’t,  so I turned my back from my workplace (where more than four persons are waiting for me to finish their bank transactions) and I headed for the CR… it was indeed a comfort room for me. And I just started to cry.  I stayed there for a good 15-20 minutes…crying my heart out.  It was already past 2 pm and I haven’t eaten lunch yet…work and time pressure coupled with a hungry stomach bugged me down… and that would definitely make anyone breakdown into tears.  I was just so drained: physically and emotionally… I’m so overworked and my superiors know it, but they can’t do anything about it.    I’ve always wished and prayed that I deserve a better job… one which I will enjoy and love doing, with good compensation, of course… my present work is not making me happy anymore and with a very obvious fact that I’m not well-compensated either… but I’m just waiting for the results of my application with our treasury dept. and passing the LET next yr.  hopefully, things will turn out in its proper place…i'm praying...

      Ok…so where do I begin?  My day was kinda ok…until lunch time came…I heard my co-workers talking at the back.  Our Clearing Dept. will be needing a staff to replace one of their personnel named Ronnie.  They were asking for the reason why Ronnie will transfer.  And you know the reason why?  He got accepted with the Treasury Dept.    I felt my heart dropping..my whole body getting numb.. I was in the verge of crying… I kept my mouth shut...I didn’t talk to anyone… I kept myself busy..acting as if I didn’t care about what they were talking and all…wow...of all the things…by far…I think this is the worst insult I’ve encountered in my whole banking career…another reality in life…another testament…especially in this cruel world of greed and power…”Its not what you know that counts…its whom you know.”  I thought there were only three of us who applied for treasury…me., Ferrer (from Loans Dept.) and Gary (from Cash Center).  Among us three…(not that I’m bragging or what) I’m the most qualified because I’m already familiar with some of the transactions with Treasury… unlike the two guys…they both handle two different depts. Not related in any way with treasury…and what about Ronnie?  Hey…he  is with our Clearing dept…another separate dept. not related with treasury…so how come he got the position? Don’t have a clue…he may be older than me…and he just joined our bank the same year I did or just a year earlier…but the point is…knowledge of bank products and services?…I know more things that he does…  Am I sour graping or what?  Well, I could just go on with this…but I’ll stop…ok…I just want to get out some steam…. I’m just really hurt with the outcome.  Life is really unfair!…but then again…maybe God has other plans for me…yup! I did pray for Him to give me this position…but He didn’t give it to me…and so He has other plans…maybe better plans for me… so again…I just go back…everything does happen for a reason… whatever the reason…only God knows…so... His will be done….

           I'll be sending this essay next week to our Treasury Dept.  I'm scheduled to be interviewed on July 17.  Nervous and excited at the same time...Can't wait for the day to come.  I'm really praying to GOD that i get the position..I pray I do get it...       I have been with our bank for five years now.  And I have considered Gatuslao-Bacolod branch as my second home.  My branch head, Atty. Henry S. Yap and two junior officers, Arly P. Famoso and Michael Conrad M. Topacio, whom I consider my mentors, have always encouraged us to take on the challenge of becoming officers if an opportunity comes.  It has been one of my aspirations to become a bank officer.  When I was informed of the opening with the Treasury Desk - Bacolod, I requested for my superiors’ approval and submitted my application with Ma’am Bettina Ascalon.       My work in the new accounts helped me to understand and deal with all kinds of people and to cater to their different banking needs.  I learned to market and cross-sell our bank products and services.  I also gained knowledge in terms of branch operations.  The seminars and lectures I’ve undergone aided me to better comprehend the job I’ve been handling.       The entire banking system is very complex.  Being assigned to the branch for five years has enabled me to know just a part of what banking is about.  If I’ll be given the option to work with the Treasury Department, it will allow me to discover more and better appreciate banking per se.  As of now, I’m only familiar with a fraction of the treasury transactions.  This opening will indeed be a new test for me and make me grow as a person and likewise for my career advancement.

      everything at work seems ok...kinda busy as always...but we're getting by each day...tired but enjoying ourselves with a few laughs and all...and the thing i enjoy the most are the times we eat out...all of us...officers and staff...and the videoke sessions...singing our hearts out and dancing to all the songs...  school?  maybe its because im taking one subject right now thats why i don't feel like im studying or anything...i call it "the detached feeling" from school...its our midterms tomorrow and i haven't started with my studying yet...tsk!tsk!bad me. :(  love life? duh! sounds alien to me right now.  haha!  with my work and school...that doesn't leave me time for a date...yikes!  i dunno, maybe im just preoccupied with my life right now...planning for my own future and all...well, they say the right one will just come along.  im patient and im still waiting.  there is this question that i read in a book..."when the right one comes, are you prepared?" haha! that definitely hit me...i dunno if im doing anything right now to prepare myself...yup! but i do pray to God that He will help me prepare when that right one comes...

      yup! its just the age and the years...but nothing has changed.  that is what we usually think.  but honestly, some things have indeed become different.  as we grow older, we look at life in a different perspective. our views and opinions about everything do change...and as we grow older, we become realistic.    oh my!i don't know why, but i've been trying to recall my life...my 26 years...and i would laugh at myself because a lot of things i did with my life right now is far off from what i thought and expected my life would be...choosing decisions in our life can greatly affect us...i would sometimes tell myself...ten years ago, i wouldn't expect myself to act, think, or say anything in a certain manner...well, i guess, that is part of becoming mature...or maybe im just getting wiser (or dumber) haha!  one thing for sure...im more cautious and i think a lot before deciding...i can't blame anyone, only myself.

      Jumping from bad news to good news…  So I didn’t get a shot with treasury…Fine with me.  Well, at least I got my request from my officers.  At last, they transferred me..  I’ll do the backroom transactions for our branch and my new partner is Tin-Tin (she’s also a teller).  I turned over most of my work to Irene (our new hiree).  I started last July 31.  I’m informing most of the clients of my transfer.  For now, I’m still adjusting with my new work.  This transition period is really new to me.  And I’m quiet confused myself because a lot of things have to be learned all at once, and at the same time many clients are still looking for me.  Good thing I once handled this position.  So it’s like, I just have to review what I did before.  No more “people-pressure”.  All day, I’m just at the back…facing the computer to encode the accounting entries for the day, print reports, read and answer the emails of the officers, and answer the phone of course.  Haha! Sounds easy?  Yup…you bet!  A hundred times easier compared to being in front.  I’ll definitely show the officers that I’ll do better with my new job.  And I’ll really love it more.

      A month and a half since I transferred at the back… I’m doing well and loving my work.  Still a few prioritizing and organization to do… Some bank files to read…All is well…  I still haven’t started with my LET review yet…Time frame…I’ll start January 1, 2004.  “BER” months…It’s going to be busy again at the bank…longer nights…shorter days…more time to sleep…hopefully.  Before the year ends…I wish I can have another vacation again…First week of December…  my friend plans to take me to Boracay.   I’ve been there a decade ago…when the island still doesn’t have electricity and not much resto bars and discos.

       when loving someone, never regret what you did...only regret what you never did.  its not a matter of finding the right person but its a matter of being the right person for the one you choose to love.    being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect.  it just means you've decided to see life beyond imperfections.  so don't say you're happy because everything is alright.  be happy because everything sucks but you're doing just fine.

      October 20, 2003  Manic Monday!  It was kinda “hell” at the bank today.  A lot of people were queuing.  Since we didn’t open last Saturday, many depositors had to do their transactions today.  And my, we encoded a lot of checks today.  Sorry but no amounts, but the number of pieces…hm? Well, I can best describe it in terms of thickness.  So its about more than 6 inches thick or high, whatever you want to call it.  And all morning, I was just helping out in endorsing the checks and segregating it.  Not to mention, I had to call clients and answer to bank queries over the phone.  Talk about having a lot of hands and keeping my ears and eyes alert to all the people coming in and out of the bank.  (yup! I’m assigned in the backroom but my table is somewhat near the vault.  So I better be “aware” of the people coming near my area.)  I was getting “grouchy” already since my superiors are “ordering” me around to do this, check that out, call this number, give this to whoever and all that stuff.  Hey!!! Even Supergirl had her weakness!  So I was kinda answering back to them and to the point that I was “spitting” out sarcasm.  At times, I would ignore them altogether and just continue with my work.  And again, Kristin and I ate lunch at about 2 pm or so.    And what really blew me off today?  When my manager was saying that I can’t have my vacation leave this December.  Yeah, I know that we are not allowed to have a vacation on December but well, I already asked permission from my junior officer.    I’m looking forward to this vacation.  I definitely deserve a break!  No one can stop me.    October 19, 2003  Highlight of the annual Masskara Festival here in our city.  I am home alone…just listening to the music cds given by Irene (my co-worker).  She let me choose songs from her pc and “burned” it for me…and that’s nine cds all in all.  She’s so good.  My bro is asking me to buy the modem for the pc.  I’ll look for one next week and hopefully again…this time…it will be fixed…  Ok… on the lighter side… some good news I just got this Monday morning at work.  I got promoted!  Actually, I still haven’t received a letter from our HRD of my change in job level.  But well, a very good proof is my payslip.  Yup!  I did get an increase.  Not much but the fact that I got promoted is already good news for me.  I’m really thankful to my officers, especially to our manager.  THANK YOU GOD for everything.       October 14, 2003  Its been 3 weeks and the pc’s modem is not yet fixed.  Gr!!!  Hopefully, next Saturday morning I’ll be home when the technician fixes it.  So how’s life been to me?  So far…so good.   I’m finished with my class for the semester.  Work at the bank?  Bearable.  But the one thing I still can’t seem to accomplish…gaining weight.  Ha!  Its easy for others, but for me?  No way.  Its like an impossible dream.  I’m a mere 77 lbs. only.  My goal: to gain 10 or 15 lbs.  Sounds simple.  I do eat but my stomach gets full easily.  As my brother tells me, I just have high metabolism.  So I easily “burn” what I eat.  And another thing, I move so fast while working.  I can’t seem to stay in one place for too long.  As my officers and co-workers tell me, that I’m so “alert” and my manager even calls me SUPERWOMAN.  Haha!  The only skinny superwoman on earth.  Sigh!  Everytime I see someone way back in my high school and college days, they tell me I’m still the same.  I never gained anything.  But the one thing I’m thankful for, I was never sickly.

      The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful • Stop me and steal my breath • Emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky • Never revealing their depth • Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love • I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips • Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above • I'll be your cryin' shoulder • I'll be love suicide • I'll be better when I'm older • I'll be the greatest fan of your life • Rain falls angry on the tin roof • As we lie awake in my bed • You're my survival, you're my living proof • My love is alive and not dead • Tell me that we belong together • Dress it up in the trappings of love • I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips • Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above • Chorus • I've dropped out, burned up, fought my way back from the dead • Tuned in, turned on, remembered the thing you said •

      i didn't report for work yesterday...i decided to visit cheng and helped babysit her two kids.  its really true what they say... when you have problems or "stressed" out, just look at the babies and you'll feel relaxed and all your worries seem to vanish in an instant.  i just cant help but stare at baby paolo...so fragile and innocent...holding him was like my responsibility for that time...to make sure that he burps after he was fed...to make sure he doesn't cry and that im holding him properly or something like i might break a bone in his tiny body...  my...such a small creature...and he was carried by my friend for nine months!life's a miracle!  just looking at him makes me smile...at that moment...he was like my refuge.

      So lately, I've been wonderin Who will be there to take my place When I'm gone, you'll need love To light the shadows on your face If a great wave should fall It would fall upon us all And between the sand and stone Could you make it on your own  If I could, then I would I'll go wherever you will go Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go  And maybe, I'll find out The way to make it back someday To watch you, to guide you Through the darkest of your days If a great wave should fall It would fall upon us all Well I hope there's someone out there Who can bring me back to you  If I could, then I would I'll go wherever you will go Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go  Runaway with my heart Runaway with my hope Runaway with my love  I know now, just quite how My life and love might still go on In your heart and your mind I'll stay with you for all of time  If I could, then I would I'll go wherever you will go Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go  If I could turn back time I'll go wherever you will go If I could make you mine I'll go wherever you will go

       spend all your time waiting for that second chance for a break that would make it okay there's always one reason to feel not good enough and it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction oh beautiful release memory seeps from my veins let me be empty and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there  so tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn there's vultures and thieves at your back and the storm keeps on twisting you keep on building the lie that you make up for all that you lack it don't make no difference escaping one last time it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here       There were bells on a hill  But I never heard them ringing  No I never heard them at all  Till there was you   There were birds in the sky  But I never saw them winging  No I never saw them at all  Till there was you   Then there was music and wonderful roses  They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you   There was love all around  But I never heard it singing  No I never heard it at all  Till there was you   Then there was music and wonderful roses  They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you   There was love all around  But I never heard it singing  No I never heard it at all  Till there was you   Till there was you

       Didn't they say that I would make a mistake Didn't they say you were gonna be trouble People told me you were too much to take I could see it, I didn't wanna know I let you in and you let me down You pushed me up and you turned my whole life around Left me feel that I had no where to go I was alone, how was I too know that You'll be there, when I needed somebody You'll be there, the only one who can help me  I had a picture of you in my mind Never knew it could be so wrong Why'd it take me so long just to find The friend that was there all along  Who'd believe that after all we've been through I'd be able to put my whole trust in you Goes to show you can't forgive and forget Looking back, I have no regrets cause  You'll be there, when I needed somebody You'll be there, the only one to help me  I had a picture of you in my mind Never knew it could be so wrong Why'd it take me so long just to find The friend that was there all along  You'll be there, when I needed somebody You'll be there, the only one to help me  I had a picture of you in my mind Never knew it could be so wrong Why'd it take me so long just to find The friend that was there all along  Had a picture of you in my mind Never knew it could be so wrong Why'd it take me so long just to find The friend that was there all along  Had a picture of you in my mind All along Never knew it could be so wrong All along Why'd it take me so long just to find Why'd it take me so long baby The friend that was there all along Why'd it take me so long baby

      my bos, sir arly (he's my direct supervisor at the bank), was rushed to the hospital yesterday afternoon.  he was in the parking lot when his arms felt numb and in seconds he was down on the ground having a seizure.  good thing a guard saw him and asked for help.   we were so shocked.  our iloilo trip was cancelled.  we visited him today and the results of his CAT scan showed a raptured vein in his brain.he looked ok but with a bruise on his right cheek due to the fall.the doctor said the blood clot can be "dissolved".but sir arly will have to go to manila to be thoroughly examined by specialists.just to be sure that his condition is ok.  we were all so worried about what happened to him.and he is like a father to us and our barkada too.he makes us laugh a lot.the branch is unusually quiet if he is not around.  we're all praying that his condition will improve.

      i was the commentator at christina's wedding today (she's my high school classmate). it was a simple wedding,attended by relatives and close friends.  i love attending weddings...especially if i play a certain role...it just makes me happy to help out (in any way) what my friends wanted me to accomplish on their special day.

      it was vincent's birthday yesterday...my classmates and i visited him...his family offered mass for him and we headed to the memorial park afterwards...rest in peace....  just a thought...there is a time in our life when we meet a person,know him,be friends with him and sometimes we end up having bad memories and experiences with that person....time truly heals all wounds and who would have thought that you could become good friends again.we meet more people in our lives.however,as time goes by,this person enters our life again.so its like you have to meet the wrong persons first and then you come back again?its like you have taken the wrong turns but in the end, you'll still get to your destination.its like you took the rocky road or crooked road....life...very confusing

      I have learned  I've learned - that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them.  I've learned - that no matter how much I care, some people just don't care back.  I've learned - that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.  I've learned - that it's not what you have in your life but who you have in your life that counts.  I've learned - that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better know something.  I've learned - that you shouldn't compare yourself to the best others can do.  I've learned - that you can do something in an instant that will give you heartache for life.  I've learned - that it's taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.  I've learned - that you should always leave loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.  I've learned - that you can keep going long after you think you can't.  I've learned - that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel.  I've learned - that either you control your attitude or it controls you.  I've learned - that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades and there had better be something else to take its place.  I've learned - that heroes are the people who do what has to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of the consequences.  I've learned - that money is a lousy way of keeping score.  I've learned - that my best friend and I can do anything or nothing and have the best time.  I've learned - that sometimes the people you expect to kick you when you're down will be the ones to help you get back up.  I've learned - that sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.  I've learned - that true friendship continues to grow, even over the longest distance. Same goes for true love.  I've learned - that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.   I've learned - that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.  I've learned - that you should never tell a child their dreams are unlikely or outlandish. Few things are more humiliating, and what a tragedy it would be if they believed it.  I've learned - that your family won't always be there for you. It may seem funny, but people you aren't related to can take care of you and love you and teach you to trust people again. Families aren't biological.  I've learned - that no matter how good a friend is, they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that.  I've learned - that it isn't always enough to be forgiven by others. Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself.  I've learned - that no matter how bad your heart is broken the world doesn't stop for your grief.  I've learned - that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.  I've learned - that just because two people argue, it doesn't mean they don t love each other And just because they don't argue, it doesn't mean they do.  I've learned - that we don't have to change friends if we understand that friends change.  I've learned - that you shouldn't be so eager to find out a secret. It could change your life forever.  I've learned - that two people can look at the exact same thing and see something totally different.  I've learned - that no matter how you try to protect your children, they will eventually get hurt and you will hurt in the process.  I've learned - that your life can be changed in a matter of hours by people who don t even know you.  I've learned - that even when you think you have no more to give, when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.  I've learned - that credentials on the wall do not make you a decent human being.  I've learned - that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon.  I've learned - that it's hard to determine where to draw the line between being nice and not hurting people's feelings and standing up for what you believe

       All The Love In The World  I'm not looking for someone to talk to I've got my friend, I'm more than O.K. I've got more than a girl could wish for I live my dreams but it's not all they say Still I believe (I'm missing) I'm missing something real I need someone who really sees me...  (Don't wanna wake...) Don't wanna wake up alone anymore Still believing you'll walk through my door All I need is to know it's for sure Then I'll give... all the love in the world  I've often wondered if love's an illusion Just to get you through the loneliest days I can't criticize it I have no hesitation My imagination just stole me away (Still...) Still I believe (I'm missing) I'm missing something real I need someone who really sees me...  (Don't wanna wake...) Don't wanna wake up alone anymore Still believing you'll walk through my door All I need is to know it's for sure Then I'll give... all the love in the world  Love's for a lifetime not for a moment So how could I throw it away Yeah I'm only human And nights grow colder With no-one to love me that way Yeah I need someone who really sees me...  (Don't wanna wake...) And i won't wake up alone anymore Still believing you'll walk through my door You'll reach for me and I'll know it's for sure Then I'll give all the love in the world (Don't wanna wake up alone anymore...)     When You Say Nothing At All  It's amazing how you Can speak right to my heart Without saying a word You can light up the dark Try as I may I can never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing  The smile on your face Lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes  Saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand  Says you'll catch me wherever I fall You say it best When you say nothing at all  All day long I can hear  People talking out loud But when you hold me near You drown out the crowd Try as they may They can never defy What's being said  Between your heart and mine  The smile on your face Lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes  Saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand  Says you'll catch me wherever I fall You say it best When you say nothing at all  The smile on your face Lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes  Saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand  Says you'll catch me wherever I fall You say it best When you say nothing at all You say it best When you say nothing at all You say it best When you say nothing at all  That smile on your face The truth in your eyes The touch of your hand Lets me know that you need me  You say it best when you say nothing at all (Nothing at all) You say it best when you say nothing at all (Nothing at all) You say it best when you say nothing at all (Nothing at all)

      HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!  God has been so good to me and my family this 2003.  I may not be the religious or prayerful type but in my heart I’m just so thankful for all the blessings.  Since I started working, this is the first time that I truly enjoyed the Christmas holiday.  Even if I ended up in the hospital (with my insignificant sickness-as Doc Rainier was saying), I still felt happy, happy, happy.  Welcome 2004!!!  So for the whole month of January, I’ll still laze around…first half of which I’ll spend here in Bacolod and the next half, until February and we take off for good, I’ll be in Manila already.  Priorities for the year: (1)career; (2)love; (3)health; (4)finances.  CAREER – Learn a lot from the company. Good working relationship with boss and colleagues.  Don’t overwork.  Enjoy the job (as much as possible).  LOVE – Be open.  Take the risk.  Listen.    HEALTH – Gain 20 lbs. (big challenge for me!) Eat more.  Ask bro to help me with an exercise program.   FINANCES – Settle all my credit cards.  Pay mom.  Full payment for my house and insurance.

      a beautiful and intelligent woman said: "I know nothing is definite and sure in life.  But if you will be mine in this lifetime, I will never give you away!" whoa! was this a line from a movie or what?  gosh!!! the best thing i've heard so far!  after reading this text message (at 1130pm), i momentarily lost my sleepiness and widely opened my eyes...and i was smiling and grinning (not to mention quitely stopped myself from giggling coz everyone is asleep).  wow!if someone said this to you...what would you think or feel? what's your initial reaction?ha!maybe i would blink a dozen times...smile...and have this faraway look on my face...just so that i would think that its reality and not a dream.

       Goodbye To You    Of all the things I've believed in  I just want to get it over with  Tears form behind my eyes  But I do not cry  Counting the days that pass me by   I've been searching deep down in my soul  Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old  It feels like I'm starting all over again  The last three years were just pretend  And I said,   Goodbye to you  Goodbye to everything I thought I knew  You were the one I loved  The one thing that I tried to hold on to   I still get lost in your eyes  And it seems that I can't live a day without you  Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away  To a place where I am blinded by the light  But it's not right   Goodbye to you  Goodbye to everything I thought I knew  You were the one I loved  The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time  I want what's yours and I want what's mine  I want you  But I'm not giving in this time   Goodbye to you  Goodbye to everything I thought I knew  You were the one I loved  The one thing that I tried to hold on to  The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And when the stars fall  I will lie awake  You're my shooting star.    Are You Happy Now?    No, don't just walk away Pretending everything's ok And you don't care about me And I know there's just no use When all your lies become your truths and I don't care  Could you look me in the eye And tell me that you're happy now Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased Are you happy now? Are you happy now?   You took all there was to take And left me with an empty plate  And you don't care about it  And I, I've given up this game  And leaving you with all the blame cause I don't care  Could you look me in the eye?  And tell me that you're happy now Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased Are you happy now? Are you happy now?  Do you really have everything you want? You can never give somethin' you ain't got. You can't run away from yourself  Could you look me in the eye?  And tell me that you`re happy now Come on tell it to my face or have I been erased  Are you happy now? Are you happy now?  Would you look me in the eye? Could you look me in the eye? I've had that all I can take And I'm about to break Cause I'm happy now Are you happy now?

      Till There Was You   There were bells on a hill  But I never heard them ringing  No I never heard them at all  Till there was you   There were birds in the sky  But I never saw them winging  No I never saw them at all  Till there was you   Then there was music and wonderful roses  They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you   There was love all around  But I never heard it singing  No I never heard it at all  Till there was you   Then there was music and wonderful roses  They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you   There was love all around  But I never heard it singing  No I never heard it at all  Till there was you   Till there was you

      I Wanna Be With You    I try but I can't seem to get myself  To think of anything but you  Your breath on my face  Your warm gentle kiss, I taste the truth  I taste the truth   We know what I came here for  So I won`t ask for more   Chorus  I wanna be with you  If only for a night  To be the one whose in your arms  Who holds you tight  I wanna be with you  There's nothing more to say  There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way  I wanna be with you   So I`ll hold you tonight  Like I would if you were mine  To hold forever more  And I`ll saver each touch that I wanted  So much to feel before (To feel before)  How beautiful it is  Just to be like this   Repeat Chorus   Oh baby  I can`t fight this feeling anymore  It drives me crazy when I try to  So call my name  Take my hand  Make my wish  Baby, your command?   Yeah  I wanna be with you  There's nothing more to say  There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way  (I wanna be) I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you)  I wanna be with you  Wanna be with you (Yeah)  (I wanna be with you) I wanna be  I wanna be with you  (I wanna be)  (I wanna be)  (I wanna be with you) Yeah  (I wanna be with you)  I wanna be, I wanna be baby  I wanna be  (I wanna be with you)  I wanna be with you, yeah  I wanna be with you  I wanna be with you

      its really frustrating if you wanted to say something but you're kinda scared of saying it for the mere fact that the other person would think of it in another way or misinterpret everything....i told myself that i would be more open and frank about things but then...i just stop...its really a battle for me!but AGAIN,if i don't say or do anything...i'll just end up regretting it because i JUST didn't join in or made any efforts for that matter...like i'm  a spectator in a game or something....DILEMMA?maybe....  am i too good or just plain stupid?  people are right...most of us just know how to deal with any situation if it happened to someone else but if it happens to US...man we are soooo LOST!grrrr!!!!  i really don't know how to start this and handle anything....: (

      had a good weekend...of being with friends i mean...i didn't study at all [ bad me! :( ]  eduard went back to UK yesterday...so we had dinner and drinks last saturday...it was all his treat...josil,ina,froilan,debbie,tintin,kenneth,rolly,mizpah with bf eumer and me were the attendees...we had fun...and to think i was kinda the "topic" of conversation especially last night....i  tried my best not to give in with their teasings and all...even if deep inside i was beginning to lose my temper...i just smiled and kept quiet most of the time...right!they know me so well that i won't get angry even with all their jokes...;p oh well!i'm still ok...i'm cool....         The Road Not Taken  Robert Frost     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.

      i'll definitely have my new life here in manila...i've kinda accepted the fact that our trip IS cancelled forever...the concern right now is to get back what mommy gave to them....  all of my friends and relatives would definitely BE worried....like the money issue and all....honestly i am too, but i just don't like to worry so much about it....i wanna be focused with my training (for now) and try to move on with my life....pick up where i left off....  again...GOD has other plans for me....maybe its not yet my time....i'm dissappointed but then again i won't try to blame anyone for everything that is happening right now....He has his reasons....i don't know yet...but i'm trying to embrace what is coming my way now....  i don't feel that sad....but there is a part of me that wants to cry

       I Knew I Loved You  SAVAGE GARDEN   Maybe it's intuition But some things you just don't question Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant And there it goes I think I've found my best friend   I know that it might sound more than a little crazy But I believe   I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I knew I loved you before I met you I have been waiting all my life   There's just no rhyme or reason Only this sense of completion And in your eyes I see the missing pieces I'm searching for I think I've found my best friend   I know that it might sound more than a little crazy But I believe   I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I knew I loved you before I met you I have been waiting all my life   A thousand angels dance around you I am complete now that I've found you   I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I knew I loved you before I met you I have been waiting all my life

       My Immortal  by Evanescence     I'm so tired of being here Supressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  You used to captivate me by your resonating mind Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me

For fear of embarrassing the other person, or ourselves, we hesitate to say the actual words "I love you". So we try to communicate the idea in other words. We say "take care" or "don't drive too fast" or "be good".   But really, these are just other ways of saying "I love you". "You are important to me", "I care what happens to you", and  don't want you to get hurt" all mean "I love you". We are sometimes very strange people. The only thing we want to say, and the one thing that we should say, is the one thing we don?t say. And yet because the feeling is so real, and the need to say it is so strong, we are driven to use other words and signs to say what we really mean. And many times the meaning never gets communicated at all and the other person is left feeling unloved and unwanted.   Therefore, I believe we have to listen for love in the words that people are saying to us. Sometimes the explicit words are necessary, but more often, the manner of saying things is even more important. A joyous insult carries more affection and love within the sentiments, which are expressed insincerely. An impulsive hug says "I love you" even though the words might be saying something very different.   Any expression of a person?s concern for another says "I love you". Sometimes the expression is clumsy, sometimes even cruel. Sometimes we must look and listen very intently for the love that it contains.   We say "I love you" in many ways - with birthday gifts, and little notes, with smiles and sometimes with tears. Sometimes we show our love by just keeping quiet and not saying a word, at other times by speaking out, even harshly. We show our love sometimes by impulsiveness.   Many times we have to show our love by forgiving someone who has not listened to the love we have tried to express. The problem is listening for love is that we don't always understand the language of love, which the other person is using. A girl may use tears or emotions to say what she wants to say, and her boyfriend may not understand her because he expects her to be talking his language.   We have to force ourselves to really listen for love. The problem with our world is that people rarely listen to each other. They hear the words, but they don't listen to the actions that accompany the words or the expression on the face. Or people listen only for rejection or misunderstanding. They do not see the love that is there just beneath the surface, even if the words are angry.   Simon and Garfunkel wrote that very haunting song, The Sound of Silence . It goes: Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking; people hearing without listening; people writing songs that voices never shared, because no one dared disturb the sound of silence... It is a terrifying picture of our modern world, a world without communication and without love.   We have to listen for love in those around us. If we listen intently we will discover that we are a lot more loved than we realise.  Just listen!

      the lines are down tonight...it started around 12mn...its now 415am and we are just here...waiting...i doubt,we'll still accept calls...45 more minutes and we're going home already...so we are just here...talking...surfing...sleeping...might as well do some writing now....  latest news with my teachers' board application...the birth certificate that was issued to me had my original name...its not chona mae but bebel!!!i was so angry that i felt like all the blood was rising to my head and giving me the red face...i was shaking all over and tried to call mommy about it...yah!and i can hear myself almost shouting to hear coz with all the hassles that this examination is giving me...i haven't had my sleep yet coz after my shift i immediately went straight to prc...and so mom told me to just forego the exam...so i told her that i would just reimburse the exam fee...and when i went to the cashier...they won't honor the receipt anymore coz reimbursement can only be given 24 hours from original payment date...and the cashier told me i could get it but it would take a lot longer and i would have to write their officer or something...i was already fuming mad and i just decided to leave...to hell with them!!!...and as always,i was almost going to break out into tears again but i controlled myself...i was really fighting back the tears...my plan now is to try to ask for ina's help...if she can still help me out with my birth certificate then i'll go on...if not...maybe it is meant to be....i still have two weeks before the deadline to submit my papers....hope so

       "If You're Not The One" Daniel Bedingfield    If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I could stay in your arms

       Iris goo g00 dolls   And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now  And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life 'Cause sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am

      and last friday,i did get five sales...well,4 net and 1 fall-out...not to good but i'm still hanging on to this one for now....  i'm praying that i'll be able to take the teachers' board this august 29 and get english as my major....coz when i filed my application with the prc last week,there was a question with the authenticity of my birth certificate and to top it off, the "bitch" employee told me that i can't get english as my major...that my only options were either math or business technology...who the hell does she think she is? at her own terms...she's letting me choose the subjects i least like...even if i told her that my cousin (who also graduated in business management-the same course as i am) took this exam 2 years ago...and that girl said.."oh well, she just got lucky." ha! stupid reply!!!well...she'll see how i'll get lucky too...haha!  last week...the other week (i mean) a lot of things have been on my mind...i realized that since i've been here in manila...i am left to decide on my own...well, its a good thing but i never realized that it could be this much....its like i should be making a good decision everytime coz if not...it would greatly affect me or my future for that matter....and do i have a future right now?im praying that i do have one coz for now its seems like my objectives are for short term basis only...yup!its all just a year or two year span....but as much as possible i try to keep my options open and flexible...and of course, its not just one game plan but i have around 3 or maybe 4 plans right now on what im going to do next...but the important thing for me right now is...try to save..."for the rainy season that is"....  another thing...i dunno if this is something i should take note of or not...my tl (team leader) boss max told me in a palm reading session...that i have my goals or objectives in life and i do my best to achieve it...that i do have some kinda focus or something...but then i would meet someone...boss max said something like i won't entirely give up what i wanted to achieve...but what he was trying to say was this person would somehow be a "driving force in my life"...whoa!maybe that person will give me more direction?i'm praying....

      "with age comes wisdom" and also add stupidity to that....  sometimes i feel like im in limbo...sometimes i feel like im in charge with my life...i dunno!  sometimes i just want to cry...sometimes i try so hard to be brave....  in moments like these, i wish that i am still back home. yup!mom is in charge and sometimes i would feel so useless...well, actually its more of being so dependent to her for so long (like 5 yrs. since i started working) and now that im alone here in manila...i kinda miss it too....but then again, i tell myself...how will i handle my life now?  am i making sense?

       I WILL BE HERE   Tomorrow morning when you wake up And the sun does not appear Ah ha-a-ah I, I will be here If in the dark we lose sight of love Hold my hand and have no fear 'Cause ah ha-a-ah I, I will be here  Chorus 1: I will be here When you feel like being quiet When you need to speak your mind I will listen  And I will be here When the laughter turns to crying  Through the winning, losing and trying We'll be together 'Cause I will be here  Tomorrow morning if you wake up And the future is unclear Ah ha-a-ah I, I'll be here  As sure as seasons are made for change Our lifetimes are made for years So ah ha-a-ah I, I will be here  Chorus 2: I will be here You can cry on my shoulder When the mirror tells us we're older I will hold you And I will be here To watch you grow in beauty And tell you all the things you are to me I will be here  Bridge: I will be true to the promise I have made To you and to the one who gave you to me Ooh ooh ooh Ah ha-a-ah I, I will be here  Coda: And just as sure as seasons are made for change Our lifetimes are made for years ' So ah ha-a-ah I, & ha-I will be here We'll be together forever 'Coz I will be here I will be here    TELL ME (side a)   There are nights when I can't help but cry, And I wonder why you had to leave me  Why did it have to end so soon? When you said that you would never leave me  CHORUS: Tell me, where did I go wrong? What did I do to make you change your mind completely? When I thought this love would never end But if this love's not ours to have, I'll let it go with your goodbye.  Why did it have to end so soon? When you said that you would never leave me  CHORUS: Tell me, where did I go wrong? What did I do to make you change your mind completely? When I thought this love would never end But if this love's not ours to have, I'll let it go with your goodbye.   Let Me Be The One - Jimmy Bondoc   Somebody told me that you’re leaving I didn’t know.  Somebody told me you're unhappy but it doesn’t show.  Somebody told me that you don’t want me no more. no more So, you're walking out the door.  Nobody told me that you’ve been crying every night.  Nobody told me you’ve been dying but didn’t want to fight. Nobody told me that you fell out of love for me.  So I’m setting you free.  *Let me be the one to break it up. So, you won’t have to make excuses. We don’t need to find a setup where Someone wins and someone losses  We just have to say our love was true But has now become a lie. So now I’m telling you I love you  One last time and goodbye.  Somebody told me you still love me I don’t know why. Nobody told me that you only needed time to fly.  Somebody told me that you want to come back when  Our love is real again.   Chorus*   Just turn around and walk away  you don’t have to live like this No no. But if you love me still then stay. Don’t keep me waiting for that final kiss We could work together through this task  Or we can work through it apart.  I just need to get this off my chest  That you will always have my heart.  Let me be the one.     passenger's seat -stephen speaks-   i look at her and have to smile as we go driving for a while her hair blowing in the open window of my car,and as we go, the traffic lights i watch them glimmer in her eyes in the darkness of the evening and,  -chorus- i've got all that i need right here in the passenger's seat oh and i can't keep my eyes on the road knowing that she's inches from me  we stop to get something to drink my mind clouds and i can't think scared to death to say i love her then the moon peeks from the clouds i hear my heartbeat it's so loud try to tell her simply, that    THE GIFT (Jim Brickman)    Winter snow is falling down  Children laughing all around  Lights are turning on  like a fairy tale come true.   Sitting by the fire we made  You're the answer when i prayed  I would find someone  and baby I found you.   All I want is to hold you forever  All I need is you more every day  You saved my heart  from being broken apart  You gave your love away  and I'm thankful every day  for the gift.   Watching as you softly sleep  What I'd give if I could keep  Just this moment  if only time stood still.   But the colors fade away  And the years will make us grey  But baby in my eyes  You'll still be beautiful.   All I want is to hold you forever  All I need is you more every day  You saved my heart  from being broken apart  You gave your love away  And I'm thankful every day  for the gift.   All I want is to hold you forever  All I need is you more every day  You saved my heart  from being broken apart  You gave your love away  I can't find the words to say  That I'm thankful every day  for the gift.    STAY Lisa Loeb & The Nine Stories   You say I only hear what I want to.  You say I talk so all the time so.   And I thought what I felt was simple,  And I thought that I don't belong,  And now that I am leaving,  Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you.  Yeah, I missed you.   And you say I only hear what I want to:  I don't listen hard,  I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running  Or to anyone, anywhere,  I don't understand if you really care,  I'm only hearing negative: "no, no, no."   So I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up,  And this woman was singing my song:  "The lover's in love, and the other's run away,  The lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay."   Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was  Dying since the day they were born.  Well, this is not that:  I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown.   And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure.   You try to tell me that I'm clever,  But that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you.   You said that I was naive,  And I thought that I was strong.  I thought, "hey I can leave, I can leave."  But now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you.   You said, "I caught you 'cause I want you and one day I'll let you go."  You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know  You're just scared to lose.  And you say, "Stay."   You say I only hear what I want to

      patience...patience....  it makes me sad to think that something good could just be taken away from me in just a wink of an eye.  oh well, actually not in a wink, but its like fading away slowly.  its bothering me.  i hate it!  and again i just remembered: nothing is permanent in this world, only change.  patience...more patience....

      maybe one of the reasons why i feel so uncertain with my life right now is mainly because i don't have a stable job yet...or i still can't decide for myself what i really, really wanted to do...(with regards to my career that is).i don't know what im going to do for the next three years of my life...why three?coz i'll be thirty by then and usually when you're in your thirties its not that easy to find work.companies would prefer fresh graduates over the "thirties bunch".  i also felt frustrated because after all the schooling i did for my course in education, i won't be able to take the board exams this august.why?because of the discrepancy in my birth certificate.seeeshh!mom also confirmed that since im a commerce graduate,i have to take the MATH specialization (which i really refuse to take).unless ofcourse, i take additional classes or so in english (which means expenses again),i MIGHT be able to get the board exams next year.yup!there is only one teachers' board every year...and that means i have to wait another year!!!depressing...frustrating!!!grrr!!!  this week...is judgement week for me...if i dont get 18% for my stats...sigh!i will be kicked out...sob!sob!and to think i already love RMH!but well...AT&T decides our fate in this case...:( sad...sad....=0

            Eight Gifts That Don't Cost Anything   &nbsp;  1) THE GIFT OF LISTENING...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; But you must REALLY listen. No interrupting, no daydreaming, no planning,&nbsp;your response. Just listening.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  2) THE GIFT OF AFFECTION...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Be generous with appropriate hugs, kisses, pats on the back and handholds.&nbsp;Let these small actions demonstrate the love you have&nbsp;for family and&nbsp; friends.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  3) THE GIFT OF LAUGHTER...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Clip cartoons. Share articles and funny stories. Your&nbsp;gift will say, "I&nbsp;love to laugh with you."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  4) THE GIFT OF A WRITTEN NOTE...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It can be a simple "Thanks for the help" note or a full sonnet. A brief,&nbsp;handwritten note may be remembered for a lifetime, and may even change a&nbsp;life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  5) THE GIFT OF A COMPLIMENT...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; A simple and sincere, "You look great in red," "You did a super job" or&nbsp; "That was a wonderful meal" can make someone's day.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  6) THE GIFT OF A FAVOR...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Every day, go out of your way to do something kind.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  7) THE GIFT OF SOLITUDE...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; There are times when we want nothing better than to be left alone. Be sensitive to those times and give the gift of solitude  &nbsp; &nbsp; to others.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  8) THE GIFT OF A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The easiest way to feel good is to extend a kind word to someone, really&nbsp; it's not that hard to say, Hello or Thank You.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Friends are a very rare jewel, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear, they share a word of&nbsp; praise, and they always want to open their hearts to us. Show your friends how much you care.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        how has my everyday life been? so far ok, but not too good.&nbsp; hey, im not really complaining here.&nbsp; it's just that it seems like im missing some things and a lot of people.&nbsp; a part of me wants to go home.&nbsp; but just to visit my family and friends. another part of me is like in the panic stage: to go abroad or find a job outside of here.&nbsp; and the other me just wants to accept everything that IS happening right now... lay back and that's it!     &nbsp;

         A LITTLE BIT      By MYMP        &nbsp;    I was kinda hesitant to tell you      Should i let you know?      i Was never really like this before      Need I say more?      Or maybe Im confused when you are near me      I dont know what to do or I should be      There's only one thing in my mind That's you and me        &nbsp;    Chous:      I'm a little bit of CRAZY      i'm a little bit of a FOOL      I'm a little bit of LONELY      I'm a little bit of all      Oh I need a cure      Just a little bit of YOU...And I will fall        &nbsp;    Im always on the run to see you      Would you allow me to?      It wasnt my intention to hurt you      This feeling is true

        How Did You Know     &nbsp;    1 I remember so well      The day that you came into my life      You asked for my name      You had the most beautiful smile        &nbsp;    2 My life started to change      I wake up each day feeling alright      With you right by my side      Makes me feel things would work out just fine        &nbsp;    Chorus:      How did you know      I needed someone like you in my life      That there’s an empty space in my heart      You came at the right time in my life        &nbsp;    I’ll never forget how you brought the sun to shine in my life      And ease all the worries and fears that I have      I guess what I’m really trying to say      It’s not everyday that someone like you comes my way      No words can express how much I love you

Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow,   for better, for worse, I will love you    With every beat if my heart.)     From this moment life has begun   From this moment you are the one   Right beside you is where I belong   From this moment on     From this moment I have been blessed   I live only for your happiness   And for your love I'd give my last breath   From this moment on     &nbsp;   I give my hand to you with all my heart   Can't wait to live my life with you can't wait to start   You and I will never be apart   My dreams came true because of you     From this moment as long as I live   I will love you, I promise you this   There is nothing I wouldn't give   From this moment on     You're the reason I believe in love   And you're the answer to my prayers from up above   All we need is just the two of us   My dreams came true because of you     From this moment as long as I live   I will love you, I promise you this   There is nothing I wouldn't give   From this moment    &nbsp;  I will love you as long as I live   From this moment on

       When I was little, I used to believe in the concept of one best friend,and then I started to become a woman. And then I found out that if you allow your heart to open up, God will show you the best in many friends. One friend's best is needed when you're going through things with your man. Another friend's best is needed when you're going through things with your momma. Another when you want to shop, share, heal, hurt, joke, or just be.&nbsp;   One friend will say let's pray together, another let's cry together, another let's fight together, another let's walk away together... One friend will meet your spiritual need, another your shoe fetish, another your love for movies, another will be with you in your season of confusion, another will be your clarifier, another the wind beneath your wings...&nbsp;   But what ever their assignment in your life, on whatever the occasion, on whatever the day, or where ever you need them to meet you with their gym shoes on and hair pulled back or to hold you back from making a complete fool of yourself... those are your best friends.&nbsp;   It may all be wrapped up in one woman, but for many it's wrapped up in several... one from 7th grade, one from high school, several from the college years, a couple from old jobs, several from  church, on some days your mother, on others your sisters, and on some days it's the one that you needed just for that day or week that you needed someone with a fresh perspective, or the one who didn't know all your baggage, or the one who would just listen without judging... those are good girlfriends/best friends.&nbsp;   Men are wonderful, husbands are excellent, boyfriends are awesome, male friends are riceless... but if you've ever had a real good girlfriend, then you know there's nothing like her!&nbsp;   I thank God for girlfriends, those who honor intimacy, those who hold trust, and those who just got your back when you feel like life is just too heavy!I thank God for you. The special bond we  share, that's unique to us. The words we've shared. The prayers we've sent up. The laughs, the tears, the phone calls, the emails, the shopping, the movies, the lunches, the dinners, the late night talks, afternoon talks, the weekend talks, the talking, talking, talking and the listening, listening, listening....&nbsp;   So whether you've been there 20 minutes or 20 years, I love you!&nbsp;

         THE PREMISE of this article lies on the principle that sometimes, loving a person doesn't mean it has to be romantic and loving a person for the rest of your life doesn't mean you have to end up marrying them. Can a man and a woman just be friends? I'd say yes and they should be./  &nbsp;  *Hindi dahil kinaibigan ka, liligawan ka na.* Not every guy who befriends you has an ulterior motive. Get over yourself. Don't flatter yourself. There is a reason why he befriended you, but don't automatically assume that it's because he wants to be your so-called boyfriend. If this will be the principle you'll follow every time someone asks you to be his friend, you're gonna miss a great deal from the friendship.  &nbsp;  *Hindi dahil mabait sa iyo, nililigawan ka na*. There are people who are naturally sweet and kind. There are people who are innately good and no matter how wicked you seem, they just find it so easy to be kind to you. It doesn't mean he is courting you. Don't put yourself through  unnecessary stress trying to figure out if he's courting you or not. Because I think if he is, you won't have to guess, you'll know and you'll be very certain about it.  &nbsp;  *Hindi dahil he talks to you a lot, he loves you na.* You don't befriend a person if you absolutely abhor him, right? Chances are you make sense when he talks to you, or you're probably very patient listening to him. The two of you probably connect on some level but why does it always have to be assumed to be romantic? Being two intelligent, mature human  beings, you need to accept that it's nice to share a cup of coffee over a stimulating conversation, and that you don't have to automatically put romantic connotation to it. Relieve yourself of the pressure. It's just coffee and a shared interest.  &nbsp;  *Hindi dahil cute ang friend mo, crush/love mo na siya. *This is the most amusing thing that hit me lately. People always assume that because your friend is cute or should I say, hot (because cute is a word you describe your high school crush while hot is a word you use to describe a hunk), "lakas amats mo na for repapips!" Let me just say this, at least from my own personal experience, I'm just nearsighted, I haven't gone blind. I can still appreciate God's creation! However, there will always be weird things, crazy things, stupid things that will keep you, believe me, from having a crush on him. First of all, you'd know his history with women, enough to judge what's good for you. Second, don't you just hate it when a guy who's absolutely always put together, who looks intelligent enough pronounces the word country as "kawntri" and the word mango as "meynggo." Call me crazy for judging a person just because he can't pronounce these words right. I admit, I'm crazy.  &nbsp;  *Hindi dahil you hang out with each other most of the time, you'd end up being boyfriend-girlfriend.* Self-explanatory... There are a thousand, no million different reasons why things don't always turn out that way. There is no one proven formula. For all we know, the reason why he likes hanging out with you is because he likes getting kikay tips from you. He probably plans on being kikay himself and he needs a mentor.  &nbsp;  *A dinner with a guy friend does not necessarily mean equate to a date. *Especially if you're paying for your share no. Hello? Three things to consider: the place, the topic and how the two of you actually planned to meet. First, how it was planned. If it were a date expect that he would ask you out at least three days before the actual date to give you some lead time, to give you the notion that you are not just a filler on his schedule. Second, the place. If it were a real date, the both of you would want real food and a place where you could really talk things  through. Don't go out with a guy to a movie on Friday night if you're really serious about him. Going to a movie is more like treating him like a "filler" just because you had nothing to do on a Friday night so you might as well go out. Topic. Ha! You wouldn't be talking about chikang artista, chikang opisina or argue if the one girl's boobs are real or not. You would be probably talking about sensible, quite personal stuff.  &nbsp;  */I therefore conclude that platonic relationships are never complicated; people just have tendencies to complicate them./*&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       u can't make people love you--we all know that. but we can love ourselves the way nobody else can, & that's the most wonderful thing  when you're stressed & overwhelmed, turn to people around you. value your friends. hold on to fun & loving moments that make life worth living.  we will always encounter challenges that make us feel less than we really are. what matters is that we can pick ourselves up.  the darkest hour is the best time to see the stars. it is when life seems most harsh & painful that the most wonderful blessings arrive.  follow your hopes & dreams. some opportunities come once in a lifetime. it's better to try than always wonder wat could have been.

       (They Long To Be) Close To You Carpenters   Why do birds suddenly appear Every time you are near? Just like me, they long to be Close to you.  Why do stars fall down from the sky Every time you walk by? Just like me, they long to be Close to you.  On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And starlight in your eyes of blue.  That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Just like me, they long to be Close to you.  On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And starlight in your eyes of blue.  That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Just like me, they long to be Close to you. Just like me (Just like me) They long to be Close to you.
