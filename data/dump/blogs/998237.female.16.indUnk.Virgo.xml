      "So Many Ways"  There must be so many ways to say goodbye I'm breaking up again But just when I thought I could hear her voice It echoes in my head I'm sorry if I say the wrong things I'm sorry if you feel that I don't want you anymore But how can I believe any words that she says to me When everything comes out wrong She's built and torn down anyone that gets close to her heart To her heart There must be so many ways to say goodbye But I can't seem to think of one this time So many ways to say goodbye  Even if she isn't mine I'm still losing my mind She's calling me again But I was so convinced I'd never hear her voice She says hello How can you ever breathe without me Cause I can see this happening all over again I think I want it to How can I believe any words that she says to me  When everything comes out wrong She's built and torn down anyone that gets close to her heart There must be so many ways to say goodbye But I can't seem to think of one this time There must be so many ways to say goodbye  Even if she isn't mine I'm still losing my mind She's built and torn down anyone She's built and torn down anyone that comes close to her heart To her heart There must be so many ways to say goodbye But I can't seem to think of one this time So many ways to say goodbye  Even if she isn't mine I'm still losing my mind

      Spadazzle One day, while at a carnival, I was minding my own business, then all of a sudden I spotted an old friend. After realizing that I did not want to talk to this person, I began to run through the crowd. Apparently I did not get away in time because the person began to follow me. Each turn I took, there she was, following. I began to panic, racing through the crowd, I desperately searched for a place to hide. Alas! the church doors had been left open. I scurried inside, with not a hope of ever knowing, I did not slow down, I run down to the basement where I found there to be nothing. A room and nothing more, I began, in a hurried panic, to run back up the stairs but found myself face to face with this person. Now in a state of emergency I ran back to the basement and began to claw at the walls in a desperate attempt to make an escape but this task proved useless for when I looked at my fingers, they had been worn down to the knuckles. Now with no other option I ran up the stairs and pushed the advancer of mine down the stairs, I heard a loud snapping noise, I recognized the sound and knew that she had broken her legs. I stood there staring blankly into the darkness of the basement room when what do I see? but her walking on her hands. I froze, I knew not what to do. Then right before my eyes she collapsed, her shoulders had dislocated. What luck! I thought. I realized that she lay now unconscious, so being the gentleman that I am, I took her to the nearby hospital.  10 or so years later I had stepped into my profession of body guarding. I had a received a new assignment. This new assignment required the use of my services as a protector of a psychiatrist at a local center for misguided children. I never got to meet with the person I was protecting, my job consisted of sitting outsider her office and to run in if anything went wrong.  One day while I sat outside the office I heard an abnormal sound. There was an 8 year old in the office and I thought to myself, well what could go wrong with an 8 year old, he couldn’t be too hard to control. After reviewing this I decided that it was the right decision to not go in. A few seconds later the same sound only louder penetrated my ears and I burst into the room. As I stand in the doorway, looking around the office, I spot the psychiatrist for the first time. In shock I took a step back, for it was the person whom I had brought to the hospital after she had broken her legs and arms. I took another look to see what the screaming was about. In a rage of mixed confusion and anger I saw the 8 year old forcing himself on the psychiatrist. I quickly reached for my gun and pulled it out, and then unloaded the chamber into the child’s back. The child lay motionless in a pool of his own blood. I grabbed the psychiatrist and we swung out the window on a nearby vine into the forest. While in the forest we had a picnic and debated what to do with the rest of out day. We finally decided that the best option would be to go ice-skating.  Ice-skating later proved to be the wrong idea. While performing simple tricks, a mistake was made. This trick required me to lift my partner above my head. In the process of doing this her ice skate blade came into contact with the front of my face, slicing it open like a knife through warm butter. She rightfully so took me to the hospital, there while on a stretcher awaiting deployment to the OR, I asked for her hand in marriage. Lying in a state of unconsciousness I told her that I had not a real ring but a spider ring that I had gotten out of a quarter machine earlier that day. She, not being able to resist my stud like ways, said yes.  After the wedding we move into a pretty castle, where we breed pink ponies. 2 years later we have our first child. He is a disappointment and is constantly getting in trouble with the law and at school. One day I decide that I am done dealing with him so I introduce the back of his head to the shovel. Not sure whether he is dead or knocked out, I lay him to his final rest under the cement of the basement floor. There he lays, to this day, undisturbed in his eternal sleep. 3 years after this incident, we make the decision to have more children. In the up bringing of these children we realize that they are not perfect, but they are good kids.  As the years go on, the children grow up without much trouble. The children go on with their lives and move out, and to no surprise we are soon forgotten. 25 years later, now my wife and I are 102 years old and the government confronts us with a proposition. They are interested in purchasing our land property so they could build an airport. We refuse and the government went on to build the airport around our house. Old and senile, I sit on the front porch in a diaper and shotgun in had. I also have a pink poodle that sits loyally at my side. In a previous conflict with my poodle, I had my left nipple bitten off. My wife, who sits in the basement all day with her thousands of cats, got tired of changing my diapers got me a helper monkey. This monkey did all the household chores, and when it would slip up, we would throw cats at it.  Not long after this, we sat in the living room watching the lion king. Now we both could feel the hand of death close at hand and we died of simultaneous heart attacks. Considering no one remembered about us we sat in our house until out bodies decayed and out skulls rolled off of our skeletons. When we were discovered, 7 years later, they could not tell for sure whose skull was whose. For this we were buried in the same casket. Now to this day you can go out and read our tombstone, which reads, “Here lies Teddie and Kevin, looking upon you, but not from heaven!”

      yea well chicago fuckin sucks i dont think i want to come back here anymore i mean i look forward to this this is like what i live for and right now it sucks and i fuckin hate it i mean if i could i would get on a plane right now and leave but the only reason y im not is cuz kevins here and im even getting bored with that i havent gone out since saturday and nobody even bothers to call i mean it seem slike nobody wants me around i mean cassie ditched monday and yesterday and i have a feeling its gonna happen agian today she says shes gonna call and pick me up but she goes out with christina instead and it fuckin sucks and it seems like the only time gina calls is when she has a problems that she needs me to fix and i fuckin hate it like i would so go home right now cuz thats how bad i feel everytime i come here i cause everyone else problems and i dont think its worth it anymore i just wanan go away and never come back really im serious everywhere i go it seems like nothing is good i fuckin hate mylife and right now i wish i didnt have one i come here to see people and they fuckin shit all over me and i wish i could actually say something and tell people how i feel but i cant so u no when gina and cass actually call and we actually go out i will put a big smile on my face and act as if NOTHING is wrong and they will never no cuz thats the way i am i dont want to cuz problems but it seems i always do or people always blame them on me cuz theres no one else so today im probably gonna sit at home cuz my so called "friends" are not gonna call and forget about me so i might as well sit here and die cuz nobodys gonna no anyway so whats the difference if i live or die because right now it seems like nobody cares so i guess i might as well die today everyone comes to me when there life is so bad and so horrible and they dont even seem to wonder how bad mine can get and then shit on me to make it worse u no fuck that im fuckin done im done with everything im giving up yes im a quitter teddie hawkins is giving up on life u no theres gonna be people tthat r gonna read this and be like o look shes crying out for attention shes feeling sorry for herself but u guys have no fuckin idea cuz u dont ask everyone thinks im so fuckin happy all the time and im not i fuckin hate life and i want to end it

      i told you right from the start. a knife up to your throat for one put through my heart. couldn't hold on and this i should've known. thinking back as i walk the night alone. i told you that my love was true. i asked you to walk away if you don't feel like i do. you whispered that you would be mine always. i felt myself slipping away. i love you forever, 'til death do us part. night gives no rest and i cannot sleep. when i can i see your face, it's tattooed on my dreams. purple heart pumps sorrow through my veins. i awaken, i'm calling out your name. i often think back to that night... the moment when i found out that our love was a lie. felt like i would die, i couldn't stand the pain. and there's nothing left except one thing, i've gotta see you again. i love you forever, 'til death do us part. forever is over, forever is over. it's over, it's over, it ended on that night... that i took your fucking life.

      "A Place In My Heart"  I saw her today, Oh God I miss her smile. A pleasant memory Of things in life worthwhile.  [Chorus:] We used to walk and we used to talk We used laugh and we used to cry And there will always be a place in my heart for her.  I thought of her today, Of years together spent. A pleasant memory Of places that we went.

          i can still remember it wasn't long ago. things you used to tell me, you said i had to know. told me that you loved me and that you always would. then i said i loved you. you said that that was good. girl, you made a promise, said you'd never want me to go. oh no! indian giver, indian giver, you took your love away from me. indian giver, indian giver, took back the love you gave to me. baby, i was feeling the way i want to feel. you had me believing the love we had was real. things we did together you said they'd never end. "now until forever." yeah, that was what you said. girl, when i was down, i knew you'd always be there. oh, yeah! indian giver, indian giver, you took your love away from me. indian giver, indian giver, took back the love you gave to me.

      ok well this little message right about here goes out to kevin because he needs to learn how to actually trust people....first off i didnt do shit abd for u to break up with me because u ASSUMED i had someone else on my mind was soo wrong of u i cant believe u would actually think that i would do that to u....then obviously all the shit u have ever said to me wasnt true because u didnt even talk to me before u made the decsion to break up with me...and whats gonna happen when u do realize tomorrow that what u did was wrong and that i do realy love u and i do really care about u and everything and u try to apologize like u do every fuckin time u pull shit like this and i dont take u back because i actually sat down and talked to some people and i think they knocked some send into me...because what they said so makes sense....for u to make me feel this way( the crying, the shakening, the puking, the cutting the everything) then ur not worth it and im probably better on my own right? but it hurts so much to say that cuz i really do love u and i really do care about u and all that shit u said to me the night before i really did believe but i guess it wasnt true and theres a part of me thats wants to tell myseld everythign will be fine and it will be like nothing ever happened but theres another part of me that says maybe this is better because then i wont have to think about u all the time and i can move on with my life but then i dont want to cuz i REALLY do love u but the thing i dont understand is i didnt do ANYTHING! really i didnt do anything and everyone i talked to tonight didnt understand either they all said they no i would never ever ever ever ever cheat on u in any possible way ever and for u to not understand that its fucked up seriously fucked up how can u be so closed minded so inconsiderate so wrong to think that someone who tells u they love u and means it with all their heart and would give the world to u would ever want to hurt u in anyway i dont understand it and obviously if u really think i liked this kid or really was obssesed with him u really dont no me at all

      The microwave beaming My heart is screaming  1 minute gone by  Another 30 seconds I feel like Im gonna die 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 There goes the gun  A moment of silence Blood on the floor My head hit the door And Where are you now? Not coming home tonight Probably got to drunk Got in a fight And its to late 1 in the morning No second chance No further warning  You'll turn off the light Dont even realize  Dont even care that i killed myself tonight  And there I lie  In the bathroom tub  All full of blood Dripping down the side And Im so sorry Didnt know you would cry  And Im so sorry  That I had to die  By: Me (TP)

      Happy Someday  it's just another old sunday  a few more hours till it's monday  the weekend's almost over  i feel myself getting older  it's becoming more and more apparent  i'm turning out like my parents  i hate going to bed early  but i gotta go work for a man  who doesn't know my name  makes me wear a uniform  so eveybody looks the same  but i can't be late  i got those credit card bills i gotta pay  hey hey hey im gonna be happy someday  then finally it's friday  im thinking life is going my way  but there's nothing to do  guess i'll hang out with my friends and i know  we'll end up at a show  where they'll drink away the dreams  they gave up on so long ago  but i can't complain cuz i've been  right there doing the same  hey hey hey i'm gonna be happy someday  someday i'll be happy  someone tell me when will that be  somewhere i lost track of what's right  and now i'm stuck on the sidelines  what doesn't kill you makes you stronger  not gonna take it any longer  it's time to take back control of my life  someday i'll have everything  i'll get paid money just to sing  a new car and a big house  a few kids runnin' around  im gonna marry my girlfriend  and fall in love all over again  someday i'll have it all  hey hey hey i'm gonna be happy someday     A Lonely September  I'm sittin' here all by myself  just trying to think of something to do  I'm trying to think of something  anything just to keep me from thinking of you  But you know it's not working out  cuz you're all that's on my mind  One thought of you is all it takes  to leave the rest of the world behind  I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did   And i didn't mean to get so close and share what we did   And i didn't mean to fall in love but i did   And you didn't mean to love me back but i know you do    I'm sittin' here trying to convince myself  that you're not the one for me   But the more i think the less i believe  and then the more i want you here with me   You know the holidays are coming up  i don't want to spend them alone  Memories of chistmas time with you  might kill me if i'm on my own   And I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did   And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did   And I didn't mean to fall in love but i did   And you didn't mean to love me back    I know it's not the smartest thing to do  We just can't seem to get it right   but what i wouldn't give to have  one more chance tonight   im sittin' here tryin' to entertain myself  with this old guitar  But with all my inspiration gone  it's not gettin' me very far   I look around my room and  everything i see reminds me of you   Oh please baby won't you take my hand  we've got nothing left to prove    Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did   And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did   And I didn't mean to fall in love but i did   And you didn't mean to love me back but i know you did   And I didn't mean to meet you then when we were just kids   And I didn't mean to give you chills with the way that i kiss   And I didn't mean to fall in love but i did   And you didn't mean to love me back but i know you did   Don't say you didn't love me back cuz you know you did  No you didn't mean to love me back but you did    "Clavicle"  Been on top of the world since about six months ago  Marking the first time I laid eyes on you  I lost all train of thought as I entered the room  Saw what looked like really good food then I saw you  And so did you   I want to wake up naked next to you  Kissing the curve in your clavicle  Kissing your clavicle   Been on top of the world since about 1 week ago  Marking a time when I was drunk enough to talk to you  I lost all train of thought as your eyes met mine  Told you I thought you were gorgeous You gave me your phone number, I gave you mine  Before you left I said that you can bet  I'll be bothering you soon  You said "No bother, please do"   I've called you twice  It's been a hellish fight  To not think about you all the time  Sitting around waiting for your call   I want to wake up naked next to you  Kissing the curve in your clavicle  Kissing your clavicle  I want to wake up naked next to you  Kissing the curve in your clavicle

      "Perfect Stranger"  Schizophrenic nightmares sending shivers down my spine I may be a little twisted, but I swear that my life is fine  [Chorus:] I'm living with a perfect stranger, is there anybody home? I'm living with a perfect stranger, but I find myself alone  Well I'm still working to make life better, though I've fallen from God's grace I'm standing still in a shattered mirror, staring at somebody else's face  [Chorus]  Just when things are back on track, I sabotage myself These are all certain telltale signs of my decaying mental health Nobody's Home!!!!!

      alright well im still at cassies listening to Alkaline Trio and watching some disney movie....the one with the teacher that pretends hes dead and the red head that goes and finds out what went wrong..whats that called?...hmm i dont no ANYWAY yea so cassie is still at greeks...and im really bored i was thinking earlier today what kinda old person im gonna be...am i gonna be the weird old lady down the street with the smelly house that cant show her face in the sunlight or the cute lil old lady that have 100 different colored socks to match every outfit...ha i was sitting at Dominicks with my mom today watching all the people walk to their cars and i saw this one guy..he had 2 little kids with him..they were so cute and the dad and his 2 kids were playing on the lil merry-go-round and having a great time but as i watched more i could tel the dad was a huge alky and it made me really sad..i wanted to cry...these poor lil kids have to grow up knowing daddys a drunk..it really makes u think and u have to say to urself god damn im so lucky and its totally not fair that u get to grow up with lil problems u think are so huge and these poor lil kids out there dont have familes or comfort or places to go to and they grow up knowing mommys a slut, the person they call daddy could be some random man on the street or mommys always so sad 2 depressed to go on, the man they call dad is always drunk, yells all the time it really makes u think is ur life all that bad? its such a horrible thought to think about all those kids out there that have NOTHING and while we sit in our 4 bedroom house with so much food in the fridge to make us fat for weeks we still complain while its 20 below and we sit at home with the heat on curled up on the couch watching some movie complaining were so bored u gotta think what about those people that live in the box in the alley and those lil babies with crack whore moms that leave them in the street to die...its such a horrible world we have these inconciderate lil bitches that piss fits because they got pepporoni pizza instead of cheese and theres those people that if their lucky they might get something to eat for that week i wish i could do something about it i wish i could help...i mean i sit here and complain and complain about how BAD my life is and how i want to kill myself and blah blah blah but really when u think abotu it my life is gold compared to some...yea i have some fucked up things in my life but to others they would KILL to have what i have its so sad to watch these stuck up kids complain because their HORRIBLE parents got them braces and for their birthday they only got 27 presents instead of 29 it makes me sick to my stomach it just makes u think haha sorry i did tihnk haha alright well im out peace

      well i got alot accomplished today..i slept alot...talked to some old friends and lost a very close friend....today june 11th 2003 kevin daly decided im not "worth his time anymore" and hes not gonna "put up with my shit" cuz u no i have so much shit to put up with...yet after saying he doesnt want to be friends with me he unblocks me..now ladies and gentlemen of the jury does that make sense...i think not..his reason of choice for this matter was because...hes not "gonna waste space on his block list with crap like me" high five kevin daly u r the king of giving bad excuses ..now normally you people would think, "omg how horrible!", "she must be heartbroken"  but let me inform u, i teddie hawkins am not upset the slightest bit, because for i have finally realized this waste of space given the name kevin daly is not worth my effort of getting upset over cuz it not only cause more stress but its bad for my health so for everyone out there reading this i would like to reassure u that im OKAY! and kevin daly has no effect what-so-ever on my life,now i would like to give out some advice to my new friend roxanne...well roxanne i wish u the best of luck and hope kevin daly is good 2 you but beware one day he might just wake up and decided youre not "worth his time anymore" but roxanne dont fret because when that day comes i promise you, you wont be upset...well now everyone i hope u and many others can learn from my expeirence....When life gives you shit, You must make lemonade out of it...and i teddie hawkins have made my lemonade..goodnight everyone

      theres a butterfly caught in a spider web...i want to help it but im afraid...just like im afriad to help my own self...i wish i could help it, it doesnt deserve to die..the twisting webs raped around its fluttering wings struggling to be free helplessly wasting its last containment of energy until finally it realizes theres no point realizing that in just a split second its body will be dead and destroyed...i am just like the butterfly a helpless creature only meant to die.....i want to be free just like the butterfly that screams....free me   omg the things i come up with haha wow i havent done that in awhile..i look at something and then all of a sudden like the change of the weather i start writing and writing and writing untill i come up with some twisted form of literature that scares people...even myself

      i had a nervous break down..well at least thats what i call them...havent been like this in a long time i guess maybe its the time i have to myself...the amount of time i have to think..i try to keep busy but theres only so much i can do by myself or maybe its the fact that my family talks way to much shit about me....they act like i have no ears to hear...teddie will never be like that...she will never look like that...teddie this and teddie that...im still shaking and im about to throw up in a few minutes...im crying...when was the last time i cried?i cant handle myself anymore i feel a great deal of pressure pushing down on me and i cant get away from it...y do i have to make everyone else happy? y does my own family push me about how i look? i barely have enough self convidence to get me up in the morning i dont need my own flesh and blood telling me im ugly im fat nobody will ever like me like the way i am...telling me im a horrible person i thought family was suppose to be there for u i thought family was the only group of people that accept u for who u are? i guess i was wrong..i guess i was wrong about alot of things..but who do i turn to now? im left with no one...gina and cassie r over since i left im invisible theyre to rapped up in their own world and i dont blame them...the only one i got solid comfort from for a year was kevin but he cant comfort me anymore.....he would say "its not his job anymore" and everyone else doesnt no me well enough to actually help me i guess u can say im alone im drowning myself deeper and deeper i go...im gonna be the cause of my own death the thought of knowing ur alone is so scary excepically when ur biggest fear is urself

      ok so shanna still is mad at me its so dumb because shes the one that read MY mail she had no right to do that and i was fucking kidding about what i said in the letter to MY friend cass i mean seriously if i didnt like shanna and wanted to talk shit about her i wouldnt say "o i think shanna is a lesbian" i would say omg i hate her but i dont...i dont understand y she doesnt believe me o wait yea i do because she fuckin assumed i meant something i didnt and she wont listen to the real story i mean y would i sit here and stress all this out and be all upset and try and make it better if i was lieing if i was lieing it would mean that i really DONT want shanna to be my friend but i do so y would i go through all the trouble? do u get what im saying? its so stupid I AM NOT LIEING!!!!!!! and shanna im fuckin sorry i hurt u but i didnt mean it like that for the 100th time..  on a lighter note... I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH JOSH IN THE HOT TUB! yea well theresa asked me today if i did and she said EVERYONE is saying i did so i thought i would clear that one up 2   on a even lighter note... i saw freddy vs jason today it was funny i laughed kinda scary but funny   on a even lighter lighter note... im tired and just burped...but im gonna go in my room and debate if i should call shanna and apologize..i dont even no y im saying sorry but since im such a nice person and really didnt mean to hurt her ill say im sorry cuz i really am  peace out my friends

      NOSTALGIA i bet that you love me like i love you but i should know that gambling just don't pay so i look up to the sky and i wonder what it'll be like in days gone by as i sit and bathe in the wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come i always used to dream of the past but like they say yesterday never comes sometimes there's a song in my brain and i feel that my heart knows the refrain i guess it's just the music that brings on nostalgia for an age yet to come ah nostalgia for an age yet to come nostalgia for an age yet to come about the future i only can reminisce for what i've had is what i'll never get and although this may sound strange my future and my past are presently disarranged and i'm surfing on a wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come i look i only see what i don't know all that was strong invincible is slain takes more than sunshine to make everything fine and i feel like i'm trapped in the middle of time with this constant feeling of nostalgia for an age yet to come ah nostalgia for an age yet to come about the future i only can reminisce for what i've had is what i'll never get and although this may sound strange my future and my past are presently disarranged and i'm surfing on a wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come i look i only see what i don't know all that was strong invincible is slain takes more than sunshine to make everything fine and i feel like i'm caught in the middle of time and this constant feeling of nostalgia for an age yet to come ah nostalgia for an age yet to come nostalgia for an age yet to come nostalgia for an age yet to come

       NICE GUYS FINISH LAST:   have u ever felt like youre little world was flipped upside down and you were holding on by a thread of survial? okay well thats what i feel like. i am getting to the point where i just want to puke all over everyone. im so sick of people acting like theyre 4th grade bitches. i didnt do shit to anyone. do i sit here and talk shit about people in my blog, no...i did once and yes i do say that was a mistake and when i was asked to take it out i did, but really it almost makes me laugh when someone says o dont vote for teddie, lets all hate teddie...like its really gonna piss me off when i dont win a stupid election in photo club. i mean come on people, its photo club and i personally dont care if youre mad at me or not. i do care to a certain point tho, like i care when people i care about are pissed at me for other peoples problems, that i just dont get. can someone please inform me on what the point of talking shit about someone is? i mean if you dont like me, dont like me...u dont have to talk about it every 4 seconds. the one thing i dont get tho, is what did i do to you? i never once said ew shes a skank behind your back, sure i said things but i said them to your face and you knew how i felt, i have opioions on things too, if i didnt i wouldnt be human. i try so hard to make sure everyone is happy and i always try to see the best sides of things but i guess that doesnt matter anymore. so u lied, sure lieing is bad but im over it, i dont care anymore, but the fact that this situation has been dragged and stabbed 100 times has made me feel y should i talk to u anymore? y should i try make things better? because today i was going to do that, today i was gonna try and make things better, because thats what i do, im the nice guy. but the fact that these other people need to stretch everything into a mini soap opera makes me not care anymore. if you hate me, hate me more power to u, if u wanna talk shit about me, talk shit about me high five to u just keep it to urself. im done trying i seriously am, y should i bend backwards for anyone anymore, i feel sick now because today i actually though maybe things can work out but i guess not, i just cant believe that i was willing to make things better and i was willing to say i was sorry and i was willing to work somehting out but after today and after hearing all the shit that went down im done. i guess nice guys really do finish last, and im in last place.

      im eating mashed potatoes...i made them myself  i watched bubble boy today what a great movie ( i didnt go to weight training) god damn im so badass  school is boring  i am possibly the most confusingest person i have ever met before in my life is that even possible?  is it possible to be in love with someone without knowing their name? hmm i wonder  my stomach hurts now   ive come to the conclusion that i am no longer going to write into detail while writing in my blog because this way i can same something withtout explaining EVERYTHING so then YOU people that read this really dont know what im talking about..kinda like a top secret code...i feel like harriet the spy  o i have a new floor in my house its totally badass   i really dont no what im writing about anymore its kinda jibberish i should make a new blog one of these days..im kinda out growing this one...ive had it for like ever im very attached hmm i want some lemonade...god damn captin random jeeze i talk about my blog and then say o yea i want some lemonade..that was really my thought pattern to i didnt stop for 5 min and then decided i need some lemonade i was really thinking about how i need a new blog and then i wanted some lemonade...i dont get myself  my dad has been a jackass about my future lately, every night he comes into my room and says "this is the year teddie, gotta kick some ass"  but really im so sick of hearing "so, teddie what are u gonna do for a living, live in a box?" i so cleaverly respond to this by saying "y yes of course thats my dream to live in a box under a bridge and eat crickets for the rest of my life" people r so stupid i really dont no what i wanna do with my life, i thought i wanted to be a pyschiatrist but just the fact that i can barely spell the profession makes me think twice, i told my dad i wanted to be a writer he said "yea be a writer if u want a one bedroom crap apartment with no running water" who needs running water anyway? and its not like im gonna be living with anyone else except for myself so y would i need more than 1 bedroom? my dad is all into me making money, and living it large, i dont want to "live it large" i wanna live it small, i would rather get up every morning happy with the what im doing than force myself to wake up and suffer through the day thats just me i guess the little things in life make me happy   ok well im done writing for today but i bet you 100$ i will post at least 1 more time tonight, what? i cant help it

      i just want to get one thing straight i have a fuckin mother i dont need some stupid bitch that thinks they can take over come into my life that im perfectly happy with and change it around ok granted my mother isnt exactlly ur everyday come home cook me dinner clean the house mother she might be a little slutty and kinda skanky and a bit bipolar and sure she calls me a bitch and says im a disgrace but i love her non the less she is MY mother and i dont need a new one and for my fuckin dad to sit there and stab me in the god damn back like that is fuckin bullshit who does she think she is to come into my fuckin family and think she can take it upon herself to change the rules around..i was prefectly happy with the way my life was going no problems, no worries, my dad never really made a big deal about where i was and now she decided that SHE wants to no who im with, where im going, and blahblahblah she wants me to call every 5 fuckin minutes and blahblahblah i love it how during this lil "heart to heart" my dad didnt say one fuckin word god damn it pisses me off...i just want my life back to the way it used to be like lil problems like this realy get me mad...it just makes me think about all those nasty things i had to go through back in the day and i hate thinking about that i really dont like this at all it just makes me think what would of happened if my mom wasnt a slut and dint get knocked up by some heroin addict from califorina and what if i never moved to florida and i stayed in chicago what would my life be like? god damn i hate when i do this...one thing gets me started and the next thing i no im crying hystrically and rambling on and on about how bad my life really isnt, ok sure i feel like cinderella with a wicked step mom that really isnt my step mom (yet) and ive probably gone through more growing up and realizing people arent who they seem then any normal adult ive met i swear...from the words of wisdom by gina valerugo "teddie u should be more fucked up then u really are" i dunno man i just dont no...well now that u no basically almost every thing about my life except for the horrible details u probably dont wanna hear...ill move on......wow thats all i have to say is wow...okay well cheating and lieing is one of my big things that i cannot stand considering my mother did it for 3 years and kevin did it to god damn u just cant trust anyone these days but anyway i dunno i mean i can sit here and but im not going to cuz A) i personally dont give a flying fuck about what she does anymore and B) its really none of my business...so im just gonna back off... ha wow god damn im in a bad fuckin mood tonight watch out!! is there any respectable noncheating nonlieing people in this world?!?!?!?!?!

      well i havent really written much of anything lately, im just sick of writing in here i was gonna stop but some people convinced me that i shouldnt, anyway im talking to kevin ALOT lately, pretty freaky stuff hes changed so much,well not like so much but its like he just doesnt care bout anything anymore..he should,he has alot of potential but i guess no motivation, hes probably scared to grow up and move on alone...maybe hes scared to be alone in general so hes changing everything about him to make himself more likable? i personally thought he was fine the way he is...o well, tony is a Kumon worker now, like me! wooo hooo other than that theres nothing else i wish to add

      teddie is emo tonight, yes EMO now shut up   And I'm still here waiting there To catch you if you fall. I don't know why I care so much When I shouldn't care at all.  Finally got the nerve to tell you How much you mean to me you said that I was your best friend, A real sweet guy, but that's all I'd ever be.  I guess that I'm wrong for falling in love, But you're still the one that I'm dreaming of. I guess that it's you I want to hold onto, But you're holding onto someone else.  If I had one wish this is what it would be... I'd ask you to spend all your time with me, That we'd be together forever. We'd buy a small house in south central L.A. Raise lots of kids then we'd both join a gang Just as long as we're together.  The things you make me wanna do I'd rob a quik-e-mart for you I'd go to the pound and let all the cats go free Just as long as you'd be with me.  Today I woke up alone wishing you were here with me, I wanted us to be something that we'd probably never be. Today you called me up and said you'd see me at our show, But now I'm stuck debating if I even wanna go. (ha i laugh at this one) (its scray how true these things can be)  okay im done being emo on my blog  incase anyone was wondering that wasnt one giant song it was a combination of Ataris lyrics dork
