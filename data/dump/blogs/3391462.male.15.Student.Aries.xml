      I am excited for Summer, I have tons plans but the most exciting that I get to go to Italy, My brother is there on a Study Abroad program. My brother is the biggest person in my life over anyone else that could possible impact me, my brother is well my hero, to say the least he is my inspiration to do the things that I do, participate in the ways that I act and try to act. Sure life is touch but I still know that my brother is there for me and will love me no matter the situation. I mean he is 20 about to be 21 and has been through the same hard path that I am taking so little hints and tips are always accepted. He knows how to be a teenager and then moving up to becoming an adult, more responsibility. My brother can handle almost anything thrown at him, and I look up to him for support about all the issues that I face, being that as it may he is the one person that I know can help me. Better then 100 social workers he is the man with the plan! And will soon teach me how to drive like a man! ADAM I LOVE BEING YOUR BROTHER!

      There is one thing that I have learned about highschool, it's really first impressions and the way that you make your impressions and the way that you act those first weeks really impact your way of life at home and school. Don't come off too strong because it can scare away people and you will need to work back their respect. The Fact is that I have ADD and making friends is a hard thing to come by but once you connect with those people that you know like you, you have hit the jackpot. After Months I figured out where in the "ranking" I was (mentally) among the students I tried hard to get to the top as fast as I could. But knowing my place, I knew that I couldn't acheive my goals alone. There is a point where you try to become friends with the most popular kids and you know they don't like you but you still want to be around them because of their coolness. I am one of those people that believe in Karma so to speak I mean I am Jewish and that is fun and all, but there are parts in the day that suck but are replaced with laughs and high fives. I then think to myself, I will make it, there is always true hope for the people that have worse desires. Just think before you act, and try to make the good times good and have fun! Thank you Cathleen you are one of my dearest friends!

      I went to Public school for the past 2 years. I was surprised by the number of kids like 400 estimated in EACH GRADE! I like the public life, there is more diversity and you are just another person in the crowd and by the time that you noticed the school year is up. $15,100 is pretty expensive and quoting Lauren Smilanich "High Class" people seem to be an overstatement. People need to understand that they aren't the finest of the fine because they are on a free ride in an expensive car, they believe that they can judge people because they are better than others and I am the one person here that cannot stand it! I don't understand why people can just be there and pick and choose the people that they like based on the looks and the perchance lack of dignity that other have from trying to deal with them. It just sickens me! At public school we had none of this, because there where so many races in the school that people liked the company of other races, at our school a black kid or Asian is a rarity at best. The ability to receive help is the best thing possible and the fact is that the more help the better, you can slack off and get bad grade and feel like the man, but not many people get that being a good kid can do better for you in the long run. I just think that there is a barrier somewhere that should have been broken between the public and private, just because a school is public doesn't mean they are all poor, and because there are a lot of kids are stuck up at my school doesn't mean that in fact all private school kids are snobs. Don't Judge it makes worse of the situation.

      Normally at the stage in High school, there are those cute couples that have always been together and have always been there for each other. Also there are older guys dating younger girls and there is no real problem with that but it is the relationships that are thrown away because they want to decide that they want to date. But the love really was suppose to just really be a friend relationship, once you take the extra step then the entire relationship and then both people realize this and once they break up the relationship that they had before it goes with it as well. But also there relationships that work. When younger girls date older men they really don't think about the relationship long term, Especially if the age margin is big. Guys in highschool have one thing on their mind, Girls. Hormone are active and change behavior drastically. School is probably the last thing that we think about, other than finals. This segment is really for the guys, no offense to ladies at the moment but the more preppie the girl the less that you can trust them the more of a gut feeling that you have the least you can trust it. You need to wait there and let the women go to you. It is simple, girls and women are just as confused as you are about life at the moment. They aren't sure of certain actions and how to respond to different things. But the one thing that I have caught onto are facial expressions and body language, it isn't that hard to catch on. If you sit by a girl that may like you, you can tell from the expression of another girl that may be her friend that is trying to make eye contact with her. Look at their eyes the way they look. Simple "hints" so to speak to women is gibberish to guys. As much so I don't get it, especially when the idea of a hint in on the table, another girl has to tell you that a hint was there. Guys are totally different in behavior then girls, and everyone knows that. But it is the girl that spends 30 minutes to re-apply make up after gym or before school that bugs me. Girls don't need make up. It really doesn't make anyone prettier or better than anyone else, it just makes others unaware of your true colors. People should like you the way you are and if you have to act differently to become that person that it really shouldn't be worth it. Be your own person, fight back a little inside and stand tall!

      Improvisation being probably the best elective besides Study Hall, is the best class. Even though it is a pass or fail course, everything is made up, acting it doesn't matter if it is bad but if you take the effort to act it. The laughs and the clapping bring rejuvenate the soul of the person acting. The feeling of a good joke and the response from the audience makes all the different. The different games and the recycling of the people bring fresh ideas into the society with ideas and new laughs. Even though all of this is fun there are always the people that seem to dislike the class, don't like to participate and feel that they don't need to participate. There is one girl in my improvisation class that rarely likes to participate and will make her stay as long as possible try too hard to get laughs and make the experience so dull that they suck the fun out of the moment, she is pretty stupid, like she makes Jessica Simpson look like Einstein. But besides that the rest of the class likes to participate and makes the rest of the class period extremely hilarious.

      The weekend is always started at the end of school on Friday. When your plans from Monday become a reality and the fun begins! The joy of the last period passes very quickly and the joy of of the ability to sleep in comes into affect. Even as the day goes by many just stay at home and they Instant Message their plans and procrastinate the making of plans until Friday, and by that time people have been made plans and then you and your computer TV and your "comfort zone" are the fun place to be. The movies that you rent and the DVDs that you see are all great. The ideal plan is to always have a person on call, the person you call always turn to. The friend! The weekend is your time to relax do what you want and then do homework when you feel like! Like I said before judging is the worst way to be caught in a sticky situation, I have learned from experience that there are ways to change the views people think of you. Try to listen, ignore the people that say bad things and talk to those that are interested in what you have to say

      The feel of getting up too early is a common when school restarts on Monday. Except when there is a holiday, then sleep in and enjoy! Weekends are the way for the brain to get it's sleep in instead of sitting in on class after class. So you heard it from me and enjoy that Sunday and when Monday comes it goes the slowest yes, but it will go all uphill from there. Go in with a Cheer. Thursday will be my day to shine, Jazz II audition and I know that I will make it but I have nervous habit of bad things when I am under pressure and I get super pressured, but hopefully I can pull through and get it done. Doing extra-curricular activities are a great way to meet people that have a same interest then you and you know that because they are trying the same thing that you are. Give it a shot and if you don't suceed try, and try until you give up and try for something else.

      There are people that have always looked at another person with the same respect or anger. I just don't understand why he or she says this way even though it pushes the respect others have towards him or her. Now one thing that I have learned is that girls are very sensitive towards hate towards other people but they seem to have the idea that if they do it to other girls or a boy that it seems to be cool, because they are always laughing at some point. Differences should be able to resolved with apologies and forgiveness but many won't accept the "defeat" of apologizing. Seemingly thinging that it will be down their repututation and the "coolness" that they spread around. You have to act responsibly and say "Yes, I did that and I am sorry," Stupid Pussies that think that they are too good for that are pricks and aren't good enough to other people. But, the one thing, the one thing that really pisses me off is that these people are the popular kids, the ones that everyone respect for some outrageous reason, they are using you and if they see it good enough hit you, it isn't worth it. So throw down differences and embrace who you are and if anyone gives you guff, screw it you are better than that!

      Everyone has their own ideas about life. Giving other people chances to regain their trust is what life is all about. Having a perception of another person isn't always how you think about them. You should always expand your thoughts and feel open to outside comments. Constructive criticism is what separates just plan criticism because constructive is helpful not ever hurtful. Being able to say what is on your mind shouldn't be taken away from you. It is what makes our country different from so many others, the ability to comment about a topic and not be shushed no matter how unusual it may. Obsequious the right word to explain the lifestyle that young teens live towards females of the same age or close to it. Agree for the sake of agreeing to please is the stupidest thing ever, that and voting for Republican because you have always been a republican. You need to think outside the box and fight your first thought, just think about something before you talk, Jumping to a conclusion without all the fact is wrong. THINK!

      This is probably the funniest teacher of 3 that I know, He is funny to people and makes humorous puns about people while they are there or aren't. He just mocks people for the hour and 15 minutes that we have together. This is probably the best study hall ever. The people don't talk except for the a hand full of people that nag his constantly and make the period worth while. I had the best Jazz Audition Ms. Wantock said that it was great! She told me I had to work on somethings but no ones perfect. Drums are great this is like my 2nd Year on drums and I have been getting better, the weird part is that no one believes me that I play percussion, even though I have a Zildjian sticker on my Laptop. TODAY WAS AWESOME!!!!!

      Finals are the dreaded audit of the brain, the essence of ever teachers life begins with "You can now turn your papers over and begin." But think of the goodness, you finish you finals you get a whole 3 months of joy and fun to deal with. Believe me you want that, the ability to sleep in when you want where you want and call friends anytime in the weekday and they can't say that they have homework. You get to catch up with you pals and talk about the future. Finals is like taking a big sponge and sucking all of the knowledge out of your brain then you squeeze it and all of that knowledge just flows onto the paper. As you may have heard I now have tons to look forward to because I MADE JAZZ BAND. Along within my other chums we can Jazz it out and hang out after concerts. Life is great!

              This is gonna take awhile so sit down… We left the day after school ended, and we flew into Amsterdam at like 8 there time 1 our time IN THE MORNING and then we waited for 2 hours then flew from Amsterdam to Venice then we took a water taxi (personal boat) with a driver to drive us to our hotel. Then My brother met us there at the hotel Santa Marina and we put our stuff in our room and immediately left for exploration. My brother was quite the map looker so he led us everywhere. We saw lots of scultures and a lot of Pigeons so many is it was freaky because there were people there that actually sold like dried corn to give to the pigeons. Were were very close to a piazza and there were lots of churches and bell towers there. We went to Murano and Burano, Murano very well know for the glass blowing there and Burano for Lace. We stayed in Venice for 3 or 4 days then went to Rome. We had a private tour of just our family to Nero's Palace, Colloseum, and Roman Forum, all very nice places. We got there and we hiked around a lot then went back to our Hotel to find out that the air conditioning was always turned off after 6 CHEAP BASTARDS! and the streets were so noisey. and the rooms were very small. We saw everything that Rome had to offer the fountains like the Trevy Fountain and the other Obelisks and churches that were around the city. Since our family had read the book "Angels & Demons" which is a mystery book and it takes place in Rome so we had a "Angels and Demons" tour that we did ourselves. After our 3 days in Rome we went to Lucca, we went to Quico Terra (5 villages) and we hiked 4 of them which was quite enough and went back to out hotel we stayed in Lucca for 2 days. Then we went to Florence which is where my brother had been studying for the past 3 months. He led us to every big church sculpture garden, museum, painting, and piazza, forum anything you could think of we tried to try. We were in Florence for 4 days then took the train to Prague, The train to Vienna was 12 hours overnight train now the train is like sleeping in a damn submarine you get llike a 5' x 1' square of heaven all for yourself and you can't move for else you could fall. then we got to the train station in Vienna, and waited for an hour and took the train from Vienna to Prague and met our relatives at the station, the train ride was 5 hours. Inca was the women and her son Michael who was in his 30- 40's and was a very successful dubbing director, he took American movies and dubbed then into Czech. He had the coolest surround sound - Home Entertainment center ever! Adam Turned 21 on the 19th a day before Father's Day. we saw the oldest Synogogue in the World, yes it even beats out the ones in Israel. We enjoyed a good 4 days in Prague and it's sites and places then we came home. If you would like anymore information about my trip please set up an appointment or IM me. Many of you have presants waiting for opening!

           I am having lots of fun at this day camp, yes I know what you are all thinking day camp is for babies, but it isn't. I finally met someone that shares interests and common knowledge as I do about things. So fun, fun, fun. Anyways the one thing that got to me is that people are busy all the time! Like not some of the time...All of the time! Just bugs me that when you ask someone what they are doing a couple weeks from the time you ask them, they don't make other plans, they work you in! So it is eating me alittle but no pain no game. I mean there are lots of people that I would love to hang out with but they just don't have the time for me! Anyway fun in the SUN!
