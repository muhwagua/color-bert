       Chicken pot PAH   Open ends of pouchy thing they wrap it in, and look at the directions.  It says something like, "For big super hot microwaves, nuke it for 5 1/2 minutes or so."  I got clever, and decided to not only stick it in the microwave for a bit longer than that (6:15 minutes), but on power level 80.  Damn, I felt like I was finessing that pastry-capped little bowl of chickeny gloopy goodness.  It did turn out really well, actually.  Microwave gourmet cooking.  It's the new millennium.

       Pizza ma non Cilantro   some amount of left over pizza Coke(tm) ice (optional) cilantro (way optional)  Locate your leftover pizza.  Slap desired portion onto a plate.  (A paper plate is fine, some paper towels will do in an extreme pinch.)  Set microwave to one-minute and nine seconds and nuke away.  (Adjust time according to portion size and microwave power.)  OK, you now have approximately sixty seconds to scour your refrigerator for fresh cilantro, or your cupboards for dried cilantro.  (Advanced losers can try both, at your own risk.)  If you find cilantro, immediately swear and toss it into the dustbin.  Alternatively, cilantro makes excellent fodder for your garbage disposal, if it is working.  Serve Coke(tm) over ice and enjoy most good pizza!  (Careful it may be hot!)

      1 can beans (I like navy beans, m'self) 2 small cans tomato sauce  onion fresh cilantro green pepper garlic whatever the hell else you want  Open the can of beans.  Dump it in a pot.  Open the cans of tomato sauce.  Dump in the same pot.  Slice the non-end, non-yucky, yes-edible bits of onion into the pot.  Rinse off the cilantro and tear off bits to dump into the pot (alternately, shake in some dried cilantro).  Slice in the green pepper, or not.  Dump in some garlic, or garlic powder if you're a plebe.  My grandma puts pumpkin pieces in her beans sometimes, but it's not necessary.  There's also these little envelopes of ham flavor you can dump in, although if you're doing it full bore you can also acheive the effect by frying a few small pieces of country (salt-cured) ham in the pot before adding the beans, etc.  If the rice and beans are going to be a side dish, you can stop here.  If it's going to be a main course, you can dump in some separately cooked meat or meat substitute (ground beef, bacon, crumbled soy burger, etc).  Simmer on medium high until it smells good and the onion is clear and limp.  Stir once in a while so it doesn't burn at the bottom.  Serve over white rice cooked separately, preferably in a nifty rice cooker which is only $20 at walmart, you cheap bastards.

      First, throw out the rest of the leftover fish that gave you food poisoning.  3 cups filtered water in microwavable bowl, heat for 12 minutes, or until boiling.  Add packet of Lipton chicken noodle soup.  Nuke again for 5 minutes.  let sit for a couple minutes.  Don't forget the oven mitts, as the bowl will be hot hot hot.  Ladle out high-sodium broth and re-hydrated noodles and diced chicken meat into a small bowl.  Eat slowly.

      1 baby. White is best. After all, it is the other, other white meat. Alternatively you could use a half-white, half-asian baby. The genetic mixing of flavors is truly something to savor. 1 white onion, minced 1 tomato, finely chopped 1 green bell pepper, chopped 1 red bell pepper, chopped 2 cups peanut oil  Heat the peanut oil in a wok (authentic cookware!). Add the baby, onion, tomato, and peppers. Saute evenly. Be sure to turn the baby often for even cooking.  Serve with a nice bottle of tsingtao beer or some sake.

      When you get off the bus, make a right into the parking lot of the garishly-lit convenience store.  Purchase one side dish of spinach souffle, as well as some chicken and noodle frozen dinner, or a turkey tetrazzini thing.  The spinach souffle does taste better if you over-cook it in the microwave, so leave it a bit longer - the crusty edges and stuff will begin to brown and harden ever so slightly, and they're just  tasty  that way.  The chicken/turkey/noodle/rice dish won't have some sort of apple compote component this time, but that's OK.  Because you bought Sour Skittles for dessert.

       post-holiday diet meltdown lunch   Come home for lunch cranky and irritated. Look in the freezer...yep, all those friggin' diet meals are still there, though the supply has diminished some over the last couple of weeks. Grab the first one within reach. Doesn't matter what kind, natch, because you've already had all the varieties at least twice. Open the box and cut a slit in the film cover. On your way to the microwave, spot the Wavy Lay's Hidden Valley Ranch flavor chips. Put meal into microwave, set timer for 6 1/2 minutes. Before closing the door all the way, sneak one chip out of the bag.  Mmmmm.  Eat a few more and contemplate the meal in the microwave.  Casually stroll into the bathroom, weigh yourself, and reconfirm that you've still got two pounds to go until you reach your goal.  Return to the microwave.  After a moment, say firmly: "Fuck it!". Take the meal out of the microwave, replace the meal in the box, and return the box to the freezer.  Continue eating the Wavy Lay's without counting and be sure to wash them down with a Diet Coke.

      Thickly sliced Wheat Berry bread, baked a few days previously in the bread machine.  Thin layer of mayonnaise, Hellman's.  Consider slicing tomato, but it's so late, and you've been working so hard, and there's nothing quite so annoying as gluey gooey little tomato guts spooged all over a plate, so you just go with lettuce as the vegetable. It's iceberg lettuce, but come on, the crispy cold wateriness of it just  makes  the sandwich, you know?  Romaine and other greens usually just serve to make the sandwich feel dryer and more unwieldly, no matter how much healthier it is.  Anyway.  Bread, mayo, lettuce.  Now, open the vacuum-sealed re-sealable package of lean turkey cold cuts, and lay several slices (as they are very thin) over the lettuce.  Press it all together into this lush-looking cheap sandwich, and tie it up in a plastic bag.  Add to the lunch bag one cup of chocolate pudding, as well as the tangerine your girlfriend was going to leave on the table at Clarke's, but you took it because, well, waste not, want not.  And it was a pretty little tangerine, and you so need your vitamin C and all.  Munch happily by the cold windows in the lunch area, taking a few meditative minutes to really peel that tangerine carefully, as its skin is so much thinner than your run-of-the-mill oranges.

      Chicken Sacrifice    First get an oblivious roomate with a substance abuse problem. Turn in early while dipshit roomie goes out drinking. Sleep peacefully until about 4am. When the stench of war rouses you from your slumber, sit up and try to make sense of what you are smelling. It will be an intense death smell that makes you wish you had a second floor fire escape. Since you don't have one of those, force yourself downstairs despite thick clouds of foul smelling smoke with tears streaming from your half awake eyes. Eject dumbass roomate from recliner using handy lever on side of chair. He will wake up somewhat but is still very drunk. As always, expect nothing useful from him and steel yourself for a trip into the source of the death fumes. Disregard the smoke alarm upstairs for now, and grab a shirt or something to use as an oven mitt. A saucepan will be emitting a plume of hellish greasy black smoke. Grab that pan and get it outside. Open a lot of windows while wondering aloud how the fuck anyone could sleep 10 feet from that. Oh, and turn off the burner which is still glowing brightly on the highest setting. Go back to bed. In the morning examine the remains in the pan on your back porch. It should look like Pompeiian archaeological dig. Foamy black shit with bits of ribcage and bone knuckles protruding from it. This was half of a chicken at one point, but your worthless roomate's drunken hubris has alchemically transformed it into an igneous fossil that is now one with the pan. Leave windows open for 7-9 weeks until you are sure the smell is not coming out of the furniture. Place furniture on curb. Serves two.

      So we're at the grocery store with 180.00 worth of stoner food in the cart and realize that we can't leave without sterno for the fondue. We ask a dudeman where it is and he sends us the next aisle over. We find cans of sterno and a  metal can of  'fondue fuel'. 'Fondue fuel' is about 6 bucks a can and curious to see what makes this particlular flammable expensive I read the back and find that it is denatured alcohol. That's all it is. So we decide that we will not be ripped off for a solvent and check the pharmacy section, don't see it. We go to Walgreens and are told to go try a hardware store. So we do, We walk in and this  urlLink differently abled  man assists us. I ask for denatured alcohol.  Anything else?   Yeah. Matches. Long ones.    So the owner of the store is all 'matches and alcohol, eh'? and we tell him that we're making fondue. Then he asks 'Is this for the Super Bowl?'.   uh   So all parts assembled we smoke up and fall asleep, and then it's the next day. I chop fruit, other shit happens during the day. and then it's time for dinner. The fondue pot moves from being a living room knicknack to a cooking utensil.  I practice lighting the fuel, she grates a motherlode of gruyere and emmenthaler. We realize that we have no idea how to make fondue. We ask online. People tell us to 'use linux'. I run out for wine. She figures it out.  We forget the brandy, but don't notice. We eat pears and apples and french bread until she scrapes something out of the bottom of the pot. declares it burnt. gives up eating and goes for the pipe.  the end

       pie and mako's stoner fries  you will need the following: potatoes (three i think) some sort of oil or other lubricant one package of mccormick oven potato fries seasoning  wake up at 7am (after falling into a pot-induced stupor at 8pm the following evening) to sounds of the girl chopping up potatoes in the kitchen.  get up, smoke bowl.  wander out to the kitchen and read the back of the potato seasoning packet carefully.  preheat the oven to 400 degrees and grease up the bottom of some sort of pan (we used glass but i think metal would work as well).  throw the potato strips into a  plastic bag or large bowl.  giggle at mention of the word 'bowl' on mccormick seasoning packet.  shake or stir potatoes around until they are coated with the seasoning.  empty potatoes  into the pan and bake for 30 minutes.  check potatoes and find them to be undercooked.  agree strongly with your cooking patner's stoner epiphany to add shredded cheese to potatoes.  bake for another ten minutes (i meant the potatoes, stoner).  eat cheesy fries with ketchup.  best.   breakfast.  ever.

        Procrastination Scrambled Eggs     You will need:   Eggs Real Butter Heavy Cream A Pot A Metal Bowl larger than the pot  Think about what work will be like today.  It's going to be hell.  Decide to make eggs instead of getting to work on time.  Fill the pot with about an inch of water and bring to boil.  You being a little late is not going to kill the company.  Put an oven mitt on your non-dominant hand and put the bowl over the pot.  There should be some room for steam.  Dump 3 or 4 eggs into the bowl with a pat of butter (1 Tbsp), about a tablespoon of heavy cream, and a pinch of salt.  Whisk constantly while holding the bowl.  Think of how cold it is outside and how miserable your commute is going to be.  Scrape the edges of the bowl with the whisk and continue whisking for a few minutes until the eggs reach desired consistency.  Put eggs on a roll, toast, or english muffin.  Watch cartoons and think about what would happen if you never went to work again.  Contemplate going back to sleep.  Eventually decide to go to work but feel all warm on your way.

      When moving out of the apartment you've shared for a couple of years with an ex, be sure to rummage carefully in the large rotating shelf thingy at the corner of the countertop in your kitchen.  There, you will find a veritable treasure trove of environmentally-unfriendly individual serving boxes of cereal.  A few, like Total, you'll feel tempted to throw away, cos you don't like Total, but there will be a few lovely boxes of Golden Grahams, an inordinate number of plain Cheerios, and happily, like manna from heaven, a few boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios.  When the afternoon wears thin, and you're feeling a bit noshy, but knowing that candy will not help you stay awake and alert, go ahead and open up that desk drawer, the one that's got these little boxes stacked neatly next to each other - you brought them in a couple of weeks ago for a moment just like this one, and you had forgotten about them until just now.  Rip open the top of the box, tug out the plastic bag inside, and snip the very top of the bag off with your scissors.  Pour several Cheerios into your hand and toss them back like popcorn, or go the more genteel route, picking them out of the bag like little tiny multi-grain hoop-shaped bon bons.  Wash down with cold water.  Or coffee.

      tea by guest loser  prak   Boil one kettle of water. Once the water is hot pour into a tea pot containing one of your favorite tea bags. Wander off and forget you did this.  Only return once the pot is completely cold. Microwave tea pot to reheat it.  (About ten minutes) Wander off to bed at some point before hearing the beep. Wake in the morning thinking about how nice a cup of tea would be.  Wonder where the pot ran off to. Sometime around lunch realize what happened and nuke tea again. Forget while reading book.  (Television, video games, or wandering off with friends also will work) In the late evening, while trying to procrastinate something (your choice here, personally I like school work but anything  would work,) think about making a cup of tea. Realize how sad your life is that tea has become a day and a half long ordeal. Nuke tea.  While waiting for tea to heat start writing about this process and only at the end realize your tea finished a number of  minutes ago and now is very likely well on its way to being cold again.

       Enchilada Casserole   I actually made my own sauce for this one...it's amazingly quick and easy.  Enchilada Sauce: 2 tbsps vegetable oil 2 tbsps flour 1/4 chili powder 2 cups water 1/4 cup tomato sauce salt and garlic powder to taste  Heat oil; mix in flour and cook for one minute.  Add chili powder and heat for another minute before adding the water.  Use a wisk to make sure lumps are out.  Add tomato sauce, then salt and garlic powder to taste.  Turn low and simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  You can always add more water if sauce seems to thick.   Casserole: Yellow Onion - diced Meat of choice - about a pound Corn tortillas - white or yellow, cut into thick strips one small can of diced chili peppers Grated cheese of choice - cheddar and/or jalepeno jack enchilada sauce  While the sauce is simmering, cut up and cook an onion in another pan until it begins to get soft.  Add and brown the meat.  The meat and the sauce usually end up finishing about the same time, so then you're ready to start assembling the casserole.   Put a bit of the sauce in the bottom of a casserole-type dish.  Layer your meat, the diced chilis, tortilla strips and cheese.  Keep layering the sauce, beef, chilis, tortillas and cheese until you reach the top of the pan.  End with a layer of the tortillas and then  pour any remaining sauce over the top and sides ( you definitely don't want dry enchiladas!).  Top with cheese.  Heat for about 30 min. in a 350F oven.  When the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted, you're ready to grub.  I serve with a small salad - lettuce, tomato, avocado, etc - and some sour cream.  Yummy.

      Guest loser: Boz from  urlLink grand ennui    Peanut Butter for Two (serves one)    Take the peanut butter out of the fridge.   Put it in the microwave on low for 30 seconds to make it easier to spread.   Enjoy the arc show because you didn’t get all the foil off when you opened the jar the first time.   Get four slices of bread, two of which will no doubt be heals because who remembers to buy bread with the world in crisis.   Apply the peanut butter liberally using a stainless steel knife, because all the plastic ones are broken.   Get set to pour a glass of nice cold milk when you notice the expiration date is 12-24-02, drink water instead.   Sit down in front of your computer and pretend to have witty and sparkling conversation with the picture of Shania Twain, or  celebrity of your choice, that you have just downloaded from the internet.   Come to the realization that it isn’t going to get any better than this.

        Post-Breakup Dinner for One     you will need:   Brownies Vanilla Ice Cream Caramel sauce or melted caramel cubes  Buy brownies, make brownies, whatever.  Nothing matters anymore.  We made brownies together one time from a mix.  We were both drunk but they came out great.  Buy caramel in the ice cream fixins aisle at the grocery store or in starbucks.  She used to get a hot chocolate at starbucks, extra hot, with whipped cream.  We would sit and make fun of passersby.  Put a brownie in the microwave for a minute with the jar or a small dish of caramel on the side.  Then put a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on the hot brownie.  She liked vanilla.  She’s probably eating vanilla ice cream with some other guy right now.  Some guy who likes classical music and doesn’t mind hanging out with her stupid rich friends.  Pour the caramel over the ice cream.  Try to prevent tears from falling on the dish.  Eat while watching her favorite show.  Then finish the ice cream straight out of the container with a large spoon.  I hope she rots in hell.  I love her.  I don’t know how I’m going to live without her.   Bitch.

      2 packets Lipton Cheddar Broccoli Rice for Losers 1 packet hot dogs  Put the amount of water it says on the packets in a pot.  Realize the packet calls for butter, which you do not have due to a tragic Act of SevenYearOld.  Realize the measuring spoons are dirty and there's no hot water, due to hosing off the SevenYearOld after the butter incident.  Add a random splash of oil and call it good enough.  Cut the hot dogs into the oily watery faux-cheesy rice crap, put a lid over it and run to haul the kid away from where he's attempting to pull one of the hard drives out of the computer.  Pull the cheesy broccoli rice hot dog casserole off the stove when you start to smell burning.  Tend to where you burned yourself trying to keep the child from thrusting his hand into lava hot casserole.  Feed the child and count the minutes until the little snot will fall asleep so that you can ferret through your kitchen to see if you have anything alcoholic on the shelves.  Think that people who hate children might have a point.

      Ok, Stoner Pizza  We all love french bread pizza right?  But did you know you can also make it, and not just buy it from the freezer section?  Do this: Buy french bread, pizza sauce, some shredded mozarella. Cut french bread in half down the middle, and then slice it in half, like a sandwich, dude spread some sauce, put on some cheese, and some basil and other spices put in oven at 400 for about 20 minutes.  Tasty.

       A  guest entry tonight from a fan called correa   *************** thai monk soup ***************  ingredients:  - one packet of chicken or beef ramen - one sprig of fresh cilantro (yeah, i said sprig. so.) - sesame oil and soy sauce (mini-packets will work)  1.) follow ingredients on ramen (or ghetto noodle brand of choice), making  sure to stir with a pair of questionable chopsticks you found in the sink. the  heat of the soup will kill any germs. also be sure to "test" one of the  noodles and scold your mouth, otherwise you may actually enjoy the rest of the  soup.  2.) turn off the heat and add the rest of the ingredients, to taste.  3.) serve in a bowl of some sort and eat with the aforementioned (still)  questionable chopsticks. make a point of leaving your saucepan, bowl and  chopsticks in the sink for someone else to wash. eventually.

Then peruse the office fridge for food items that have been left and eat everything you can find.  Laugh heartily.

        variation on a theme   Fry half a vidalia and half a red onion in canola with a little basil. Put two pieces of bread side by side on the tray for the toaster oven. Put the fried onions on top of that, then cover it all with shredded mozzarella. Put this in the toaster oven for 5 or so minutes. You now have an open face grilled cheese. Eat with knife and fork. For extra loser cred, have ketchup on the side for dipping.

Sandwich Ingredients: Louis Rich Low Fat Turkey Bologna  White Bread of some kind or another Squirt or two of Mustard (French's yellow stuff) Squish it all together; wash it down with a diet coke.

      Excellent biscuits. Eat them with a lot of butter and your favorite jelly (I like strawberry), or with gravy, or creamed chipped beef, or whatever.  2 cups of flour a tablespoon baking powder  a teaspoon salt  a tablespoon sugar  about 1/3 cup shortening (maybe slightly more) about a cup of milk (maybe slightly less)       In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. A slotted spoon works fine.  Stir in the shortening, a little at a time, until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Don't be anal, but if you find any big lumps of shortening, squish them in better.  Gradually stir in milk until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. You might not need the whole cup, so try to make an executive decision.  At this point, the dough gets pretty hard to stir and you'll briefly wonder whether this shit is really worth it. It is.  Put the dough onto a floured surface (like, the countertop, dude) and work it LIGHTLY a couple of times with your hands so that the lump of dough seems to generally stay together. You need to learn, fucker, that kneading does not a tender biscuit make, so don't overdo it. It won't be completely smooth, but will be floury and sort of unkempt-looking. Get over it.    Pat or roll the dough out to approximately 1 inch thick.  Two or three rolls with the pin will get you where you want to go. This isn't rocket science. Cut biscuits out of the dough with a large cutter - at least 2" to 3" (bigger is always better, as you well know) or any large glass/plastic tumbler dipped in flour. Repeat until all dough is used. The more you work the dough, the less fluffy your biscuits will be, so the ones you cut at the end after re-rolling the dough a few times may not rise as high or be as fluffy as the first few. Do your best. They'll still taste good.  Brush off any excess flour and place biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet.   Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the oven that you preheated to 425 F or until they look golden brown enough for you. This is enough dough for six ex-large biscuits, if you do it right.

      Goyim Gourmet Latke's  2 russet potatos, peeled and shredded 1 egg  some flour - you decide what is right for you my friend 1 small onion, chopped  i reccomend grabbing handfuls of the potato shreddings and squeezing the water out, then add the flour. alternately just add more flour. you are looking for a fairly dry consistency but still some moisture. crack the egg and throw it in. add that onion, joe. mix it up good. heat up some vegetable oil in a pan, the more you use the crispier they will be i think, you could use a little and cook them like pancakes, or alot and cook them like deep fried.  serve with ketchup and for an added treat, some campbell's cream of mushroom soup !

      Let's hear it for  urlLink Mott Cromby  again   Mustard and Relish Deviled Eggs   All you need for this delectable loser snack is 3 or 4 or 5 eggs, some ordinary yellow mustard, and relish. Mustard and relish, as you know, never go bad - which is why everyone always seems to have a partially used container of each in the fridge!  Boil the eggs for as long as you're supposed to boil them to make hard-boiled eggs. This might be 3-4 minutes, or it might be more like 8-10. If you're not sure, ask someone else in the house or, as a last resort, call Mom. (Warning: if your Mom is the type to worry about the loserish tendecies of offspring with chronically bare refrigerators, you might not want to bother her. But if you're certain your Mom doesn't give a crap, call her, because it's sort of a prerequiste even among the most deliquent Moms to know this sort of stuff.)  So you've got your hard-boiled eggs. Cool them by dumping out the boiling water and replacing with cold water from the tap. Then de-shell them the best you can. There's an art to this. Enough said.  Once the eggs are peeled, cut them in half and remove each portion of yolk with a teaspoon. Put the naked yolks in a bowl, the peeled half-whites on a paper plate, and let everything cool in the fridge for a while. Go drink another beer. Or four.  Later, crumble the cooled yolks in the bowl with a fork, stirring in quantities of mustard and relish to taste, until you have a sickly-looking greenish yellow paste. Apply the paste to the yolkless concavites of the egg whites and voila! They're not yolkless anymore!  Eat and think to yourself how it's not half-bad. This more or less tasty snack that can, as always, be considerably livened up by snapping on your metaphorical beer-goggles.  (Note: If you've used some kind of fancy mustard, like Grey Poupon, you are way ahead of the game. Sweet relish or dill works equally well. That other kind of relish with the bits of red stuff in it works really well. And if you're entertaining, rolling the egg whites in paprika or chili powder can impart a measure of credibility, while keeping the snack comfortably within the parameters of loserdom.)

       Ladies man and shambling mound  urlLink Paul Robinson  shares his recipe for slop:   1 Large Can Chili 4-5 packs ramen  (Adjust for more or less people) 1 can Mr. Pibb / Dr. Pepper / The Skipper or equivalent (optional)  Cook Ramen in boiling water according to directions on package, only using about 1/2 the amount of water usually specified on package, which means about 1 cup water for each pack.  This makes the ramen a bit firmer than usual.  You may add the flavoring pouch for taste if desired.  Cook the chili in a separate pan.  Mix the ramen into the chili without adding the water from the ramen.  The chili may be a bit thick.  Thin the chili with some of the broth from the Ramen according to how much chili gravy you want..  For a sweeter taste, use some Dr. Pepper in place of water.  Note that Dr. Pepper type soft drinks are the ONLY ones you can do this with, Dr. Pepper type is the only soft drink that you can heat and it is drinkable.  Any other soft drink will go bad when exposed to heat.  When it's hot, it's ready.  When you see what it looks like, you'll know why I call it "Slop."

      From guest loser Mark:  OK, here is my recipe for  Delightful One Bean Loser Salad:   Find bowl in heap of dirty dishes in the sink, and wash only it, using shampoo since you're out of dishwashing liquid. Open that can of garbanzo beans that has been in the cupboard since before you moved in. Drain liquid from beans, and if you're feeling energetic, rinse them. All this can be accomplished without removing beans, if you are a clever loser. OK,  now  remove the beans, putting them in your one clean bowl. Dig around in refrigerator for that  one bottle of blue cheese dressing that is one tenth full and hasn't gone bad. Pour on top of beans, mix and eat! Mmmmmm! Now put bowl back on pile in sink, and wonder if you can afford to invest in paper plates.  I used this recipe two nights ago. I should be on cable TV, no?

       Not necessarily a recipe, more a lifestyle   Get really big bag of hard cheezies. Not nacho or other non-traditional somesuch.  urlLink Hawkin's  is best. Open.  line them up on the arm of a comfortable chair in the living room. go from smallest to biggest. use the other arm of the chair if you need to. don't lay out a tea-towel under them or anything.  eat from small to large. or large to small if you must, but that's a little mental.  alternate hard-crunching with slowly letting cheezie melt. do not use dip. preserve the integrity of the cheezie. long may it reign.

       whomp of grain in a goddamn bowl  or, loser tabouli   tabouli was on sale last week! you like it, so you bought a box of mix. now you'd like to enjoy it. here's how: pour the bag of stuff inside the box into a bowl. forget that you have a clean, appropriately sized bowl in the dishwasher and use the way too big one. add however much water they want you to.  add 1 tablespoon of olive oil rather than the recommended 2 tablespoons. your ass isn't getting any smaller, bessie. lucky you! grape tomatoes were also on sale and you got a humdinger of a boxful. cut them lengthwise and toss them in until it looks like as many as you'd want in your snack. stir it around. cover it with saran wrap and put it in the refrigerator. the box says it will be ready in an hour but i have found the box to be a lying, thieving ne'er-do-well. i'd give it a couple hours. when you are ready to eat it, stir it around some more. transition some portion to a smaller bowl for an individual serving if that is the sort of thing you prefer.

      makin' bacon.   whether you're the man or the woman, bring it home.  put bacon on a dish, one of those microwave, ribbed, hard-plastic ones if you've got one but who in god's name does? put bacon in the nuker for 4 minutes. turn the sizzling strips over onto other side, pausing just to swear at bacon burning fingers mercilessly. another 2 minutes. while exposing tasty pork strips to electromagnetic waves, get soft white bread or the butts in the freezer and toast. slather with butter, then the bacon, (sop up excess grease with SUBWAY napkins in kitchen drawer but leave a glisten) then the lettuce, then the razor-thin tomato slices THEN the mayonnaise. mayo must sit right beside the tomatoes, because they are inseparable.  enjoy delicious sandwich. and more importantly, amazing home aroma.  bacon is the new pirates of the internet.

      valentine's day is over, and according to the candy marketing machine, that means it's easter! while we have almost two whole months to enjoy our favorite easter candy, the c*db*ry creme egg, this glorious season will be over far too soon. friends, take advantage of those day-after-easter blowout sugar sales. buy a case of creme eggs. put them in your freezer. take them out one at a time and let them come to room temperature for an hour or so for original creme-y goodness, or eat at any stage of frozen for a chewy treat. you'll thank me in a few more months when all you can think about is licking the creme out of a chocolate egg.

       Shame Snack   1) Go to little sandwich shop in your building with the crazy bi-polar waitress lady. 2) Order whatever you think will make her the least mad. 3) Do not find ATM card. Freak out. 4) Have bi-polar lady give you the sandwich and tell you to "pay me when you find the card later". 5) Thank her, go back to work. 6) Completely forget about this episode for a good 2 weeks. 7) Suddenly remember, avoid first floor of your building all together.  8) Think about what a terrible person you are.

       Corporate Power Breakfast for One   Stand at the counter, looking sort of lost and tired.  Find change purse.  Find wallet, find that little packet of breath mints you thought you'd lost.  Get distracted, and then annoyed when there's no one there to help you.  Look hungry, smile.  People like when you smile, otherwise you're a  urlLink sucky customer .  Order cinnamon scone, grasp it firmly in hand as you shift wallet, purse, change purse, and juggle ID card to get through to the elevator banks and up to your floor.  Sit at desk, check Wall Street Journal for stock price, boot up computer.  Break scone into little crumbly sweet fattening morsels.  Eat slowly, wash down with ice water.  At least it's Friday.

       really good veggie soup   clean out freezer assemble half-eaten bags of frozen vegetables from those spirited grocery store trips where you vow you are going to start eating better.  throw vegetables (my selection included broccoli, cauliflower, peas, carrots, mushrooms, and corn) into that avocado green crockpot you got at a garage sale for $2.  throw in a can of stewed tomatoes because if you don't that can is just going to sit in the cupboard for the next 6 months until you move.  honestly, who the hell bought a can of stewed tomatoes?  throw in some tomato juice and some spicy hot V8 and stir the stuff around.  add more of either liquid if the mixture isn't quite as soupy as you desire.  turn the crockpot on high and ignore for about five hours.  if you happen to walk past the crockpot, feel free to poke a wooden spoon in there and stir things up. accompany soup with a large chunk of crusty bread.

      Guest loser  urlLink andy  has 2 recipes and a field trip.    I have two recipes for you, but first, go to the store.  Get a chunk of feta cheese (pre-crumbled if they have it), a tomato, some olive oil, some French or Italian bread, and some fresh parsley.  Also buy some Yuengling, some chips, and some honey (if you don't already have these).   The First Recipe:  This is a good recipe that you can use to fake culinary sophistication.  Dice your tomato (that means cut it up pretty small).  Put the pieces in a cereal bowl.  If you bought a chunk of feta that was about three times bigger than a zippo, cut half of it off and crumble it into the cereal bowl.  It will crumble easily, so don't get carried away.  Then get your parsley and tear a bunch of the leaves off.  Use something sharp to chop them up pretty small.  Add these to the bowl, so that there are enough that you notice them, but not enough that there are too many.  Slice the bread.  Put it in the oven and toast it.  Check it every minute or two to see if it's crisp.  Take it out when it is.  Drizzle a little olive oil on it.  Go back to your cereal bowl and mix up the contents pretty good.  Then you put some on the bread and voila, an easy snack, or appetizer, or whatever.  Takes about 5-10 minutes, not counting the grocery trip.   The Second Recipe  A fast easy snack for the loser with the munchies:  tortilla chips and honey.  Step 1: Put honey on chip Step 2: Eat Step 3: Wash down with beer Step 4: Repeat

      A late night snack that's sure to keep you up even later:  Take one flour tortilla from the fridge and warm it slightly in the microwave. Spread a bit of cream cheese on it.  Spread a bit of spicy sweet mustard on it. Top with a few slices of your favorite lunchmeat - pastrami, ham, turkey; this recipe does not work well with tofu products. Roll and consume.  May be cut into multiple little rolly-things if more food is desired.  If you need that little taste of sweet after consuming such a scrumptious late night treat, dip a spoon in the leftover chocolate frosting and lick clean.

      Guest loser  Panacea  has something for you eligible cooking man-losers   Bachelor Chicken Dinner   Suitable for sort of impressing your date, at least if they aren't vegetarian anyway.  About half an hour before they are supposed to come over, pull two frozen boneless chicken breasts out ofthe freezer.  (Or more, if you are into that sort of thing.)Rub with oil, then sprinkle with Cajun seasoning blendwhich is the cooking loser's friend because it covers up freezer burn pretty well. Wrap each piece of chicken in tin foil and throw them in the oven which you now remember you should have turned on to 350F before you started this project so it would have time to preheat. (Make sure the chicken packets have the open side of the foil up because if enough crud accumulates in  the bottom of your oven you will set off the smoke alarm.)  Take two (or however many) potatoes which are not too scrungy (cut off any sprouty bits), scrub and slash the long way, wrap in foil and throw in the oven with the chicken.  Fix yourself a drink.  Hope your date shows up on time.Decide what the hell, if they don't show up at least you will have leftovers.   When your date shows up, fix them a drink, but don't start making snooky on the couch because dinner's in the oven.   When the chicken and potatoes have been in there for about 45 minutes, go back in the kitchen and throwsome frozen veggies or pre-cut carrots in the steamer basket. (Those stupid folding steamer baskets youcan get for under five bucks US are really the loser's friend, because you can steam veggies in them and *NOT GET THE POT DIRTY* because steam is just boiling water and if it's boiled, it's clean, right?) Steaming the veggies will take between five and ten minutes depending on whether they were fresh or frozen, what they were (carrots take longer than broccoli) and how cooked you want them.  About this time the oven should be hissing and might even be belching black smoke if you didn't listen to what I said about putting the seam in the tin foil on the top.  Turn the oven off.  With potholders or tongs pull out the little foil-wrapped gobbies of chicken and potatoes, and throw some bread in the hot-but-off oven to warm up while you peel the foil off and put the chicken and taters on plates.  Then serve your steamed veggies, and hot bread, butter on the side and a nice glass of wine (or several).  And look, no nasty roasting pan!  Just a bunch of tin foil you can wad up and put in your neighbors' recycling bin!

        Diet Eggnog     you will need:   2 tbsp heavy cream 1 raw egg 1 tbsp powdered milk whole milk 1/8 tsp vanilla  Combine all ingredients except whole milk in glass, then fill the rest of the way with milk.  Sure, it's high in fat but it tastes great.  And it's diet because with the raw egg there's a slim chance that you'll get salmonella and lose like 30 pounds.  Separate the egg and beat the white before adding for extra fluffiness.

      Guest loser  urlLink Boz  is back again   Potato Chip Sando   Take 2 slices of bread, any kind, I prefer white bread, because … well because I am so white bread. Take 1 slice of your favorite luncheon meat, mine is bologna because I am full of it. Spread your favorite sando spread liberally, because, yes, you guessed it, I am a liberal, on both pieces of bread. Place luncheon meat on one slice of bread. Open a bag of potato chips, stale chips will not do. Take at least half a dozen whole chips and cover the luncheon meat side of the sando. Take the other piece of bread and scrunch the sando together. Eat, and enjoy the sando while pretending that the crunching chip sounds are crunching lettuce sounds, thus deluding yourself into believing that you have a healthy diet. Lather, rinse, repeat.

       GT   Drive home from work. Think about how nice it would be to have a drink. Consider beer, find it tiring. Head to grocery store. Peruse liquor aisle. Think that  being able to buy all sorts of booze in the grocery store at damn near any time you want is a small perk to living in Missouri.   select 9.00 bottle of Seagram's gin add 2 bottles of Vess tonic water and 2 limes  Head home. Realize it's been about 2 years since you've made ice and unless the ice fairy magically visits your apartment in the next 5 minutes there won't be any. Stop at 7-11. Scrape change out of cupholder in car and buy a bag of ice. Go home for real this time.   Slice lime into wedges, beat the ever lovin shiznit out of the bag of ice to dislodge pieces to fit in short tumbler. Fill about 1/4 of the glass with gin. Pause. Ponder. Fill about 1/3 of the glass with gin.  Open bottle of tonic water. Curse as it spooges all over the counter and the floor. Fill the rest of the glass with the tonic water and squeeze a bit o' lime on top. Drop lime in glass. Sigh. Chill out on futon.

      Guest loser  Ryan  makes us a sammich!   First, check all three bags of mostly-gone bread bags to see which one has the least chance of having mold on a piece other than the butt.  Mix and match any two pieces that won't crumble to the ground when picked up.  Plug in $9.99 Sandwich maker from Target (that's Tar-jay).  Wait until the green light comes on.  Meanwhile, pray one of those cheap packets of America's Choice lunchmeat (so they say) in your fridge hasn't expired.  If a skin that normally doesn't appear around turkey is hanging on, pull it off.  Do not try to figure out what it is!  Grab a slice of cheese.  If no slices are left and you have a packet of Parmesan cheese left over from the night before when you ordered Papa John's, you can substitute, although it doesn't melt real well.  Then put contents between the two sorry pieces of bread and place on one side of the sandwich maker that you have been too lazy to clean for the past month.  Expect the sandwich to stick to surface because of this.  Close lid and turn on radio.  Play air guitar for approximately one minute.  The green light should be off.  Lift lid and grab the sharpest thing in your drawer or sink if not one utensil is left in the drawer.  Saw back and forth until sandwich comes loose.  Do not look at sandwich before eating.  Throw in mouth while concentrating on anything other than the taste that is exuding from the object you are cosuming.  Repeat all steps if hunger feeling has not gone away.  Or just eat a piece of bread plain because that did not taste very good anyway.  :)

       Coffee Crack   Hit snooze alarm at least three times.  Get up after untangling yourself from the veritable swaddling clothes you've created for yourself out of bedsheet, comforter, quilt, and a few articles of clothing you neglected to toss onto the floor before you dropped off into oblivionsweetoblivion the night before.  Bladder's full, right?  So take care of that before anything else, even if your adorable cat is glaring at you from the kitchen table, glaring, seething, pawing at that piece of tissue paper you left there, the  crinkle crinkle rasp  noise just about driving you insane.  She knows this, too.  She very well fucking knows this.  It's only her cuteness that keeps you from killing her, after all.  It's now 6:19 AM, and the cat wants her kibble.  Feed cats, then stumble over to the pantry for the large white coffee mug that says, "Hi, my name is Chad, and I'll be your coffee mug today."  It is a pleasing mug, if somewhat plain, for it does not taper at any point - its mouth is as wide as its base, and it sits solidly wherever you place it.  After filling it with filtered water, place it (solidly) onto the rotating dish in the microwave, hit two-oh-oh, and set that puppy to 'waving.  While that does its radioactive-surely-it-must-be-carcinogenic dance, check e-mail.  Wait hungrily for that prolonged beep.  Rescue Chad the Mug from the microwave, and shuffle to the pantry once more to retrieve International Foods' coffee powder sugar crap in either White Chocolate Froo Froo or Bitter Carbo Explosion Orange Cappuccino.  Dump two very healthy rounded tablespoons on top of the heated water, being careful to dip the spoon into the mug along the side so that the powder does not stick to the spoon in a slimy gunge, and will therefore mix into the water pleasingly, creating a hot, sweet, slightly coffee-like liquid that you may then sip at leisure while ripping songs to MP3 and putting on boots, etc.  For added Crack-ness, a half-spoon of Taster's Choice will give you extra added oomph and nastiness that will certainly wake you up the right way.  Viva la Coffee Crack!

      Guest loser  Thena  gives us   Blurp ... because that was the noise it made when you tried to get it out of the saucepan.   Step 1:  Version A:  Prepare a box of the cheapest no-frills macaroni and pseudocheese according to package directions, except you can leave out the butter if you don't have any;  OR  Version B:  Cook the noodles from a package of Ramen, then drain them and add as much of the seasoning packet as you can stand to the damp noodles (they look like brains, don't they?);  OR  Version C:  Discovering that you have no ramen or macaroni-and-food-coloring left in the cabinet, scrape together the dregs of three or four kinds of dried pasta, you know, the stuff that's been left in the bag forever because there was too much to throw out but not enough to actually bother cooking? Well, dump it all together and cook it, drain, then add a can of cream-of-anything soup, and if you're feeling frisky, one of the following: curry powder, chili powder, garlic salt, italian salad dressing, lemon pepper, barbecue flavoring, bouillon (mixing too many of these is not recommended);  You can eat it at this point but for genuine blurp, continue to  Step 2:  To whatever version of pasta plus vaguely flavored sauce, add some combination of freezer-burnt vegetables (usually peas or broccoli), leftover meat, or that little chunk of cheese you found in the secret compartment in the fridge (making sure to remove all mold that isn't supposed to be there; if this leaves you with no cheese, skip it.)    You might have to add a little butter, oil or water if the result looks like it's going to stick to the pan.  You are aiming for a texture wetter than cookie dough and stickier than soup.  When everything you threw in there is heated through, and the cheese is all melted and gooey, eat it straight from the pan over the stove, because if you try to serve it into a dish like the civilized person your mother swore you would never grow up into, it will make a really disgusting noise.  It actually tastes pretty good, though.

       Rigatoni Carbonotsogood   Boil a bag rigatoni noodles. About 2/3 of the way through start making the sauce. I used the Knorr kind that comes in an envelope. In fact, I used two. Not because it was so amazing that I thought doubling it would make it that much more better, but because I had 16 oz. of pasta and one envelope is good for 8. Drain pasta. Pour sauce on top. Mix profusely. Open a Newcastle. Shovel forkful of pasta in face. Take a another bite because you think you missed something. Yeah. Something that tastes like carbonara sauce. Eye directions on Knorr envelope making sure sauce was made correctly. Eat rest of bowl because you're hungry. Stare at large pot on stove that contains pasta with library paste. Put in gladware. Curse because you know that pot is not going to be easy to clean. Consider tossing some garlic salt on the leftovers tomorrow. Shrug.

Note that it isn't that much. Realize there is a kitchen full of pudding cups a few feet away. Start assembling lunch.  Fry up some potatoes and onions. We've been through this before. Pack those up in one of those gladware containers. 1 blood orange 1 regular orange 1 granola bar 1 vanilla yogurt 1 pudding cup 1 fruit cup 1 ziploc bag of carrot chips accompanied by a small cup of hummus 1 envelope of kikkoman instant wakame  Stuff most of this into lunchbox and  the rest in the bookbag.

       Lentils for Peace  from guest loser Panacea  Need: two cooking pots with lids dried lentils rice onion bits (dried) curry powder salt and pepper yogurt (optional)   In first, two cups dried lentils and four cups water. In second, two cups rice and four cups water.  Starting at the same time, bring both to full rolling boil.   Stir the rice, turn the heat down to lowest setting, and cover. Stir the lentils, turn heat down to lowest setting, add 1/4  cup dehydrated onion chips, 1 tablespoon curry powder,  salt and pepper (or Cajun spice blend, why -don't- you have  this?) to taste, stir again and cover.   Let simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring the lentils  occasionally but leaving rice alone.    Put cooked rice in beat-up old cake pan, forming a ring. Put lentils into center of ring and over rice. If not vegan, put a splop of plain yogurt on top.  Wrap in tin foil and towel and take to protest / potluck.  Share.

       shrimp scampi for losers   50 mg Benadryl one bag of frozen pre-cooked shrimp (i bought mine with the little tails already ripped off, because i am an especially lazy cooking loser) something oily (i used olive oil, but the only reason i have it is because i stole it from my ex) minced garlic in a jar.  once you start buying this stuff, you will wonder how you ever lived without it. lemon juice.  i just used the reaLemon stuff in the squeeze bottle.  the benadryl is important when you are a cooking loser with a shrimp allergy.  shrimp is probably my favorite food, so omitting it from my life is not an option at this point in time.  once you've swallowed the benadryl, you're in business.    thaw shrimp.  grab a pan or a wok or something.  saute garlic in whatever oily stuff you have around until the little garlic chunks are soft.  throw in the shrimp, add some salt and pepper and stir it around.  keep stirring until your entire kitchen smells like garlic shrimp and your stomach is ready to revolt against you because you haven't eaten all day.  add some lemon juice and serve it up.  watch closely for hives over the next 24 hours.

       Fat and Gooey Tuesday  from guest loser Peggy  - Plan on making gumbo for a festive, Mardi Gras-themed family dinner. - Have 11-year-old remind you at 5:30 that he has basketball practice in an hour, and he has  invited his friend to stay for dinner before practice. - Preheat oven to 425 degrees for Jack's frozen cheese pizza. - Have husband walk in from work and ask "What's burning?" - Open oven door and find remains of Keebler Fudge Stripe Cookie package that you had hidden in   there away from 16-year old son, who would eat them all and not leave any for his brother's   lunchbox. - Remove oven rack and melted cookie package from oven (with mitts), and place on top of stove,   then open kitchen window to fan smoke out before the fire department shows up because the    alarm system is connected to them when the smoke detector goes off. It would not be the first   time. (See: Infamous Indoor Ancho Chile Toasting incident of 1999.) - Throw cookie package in sink, and notice that the sections of cookies have fused into a   not-unattractive, nouveau-towerish sort of mass. Briefly consider serving these as dessert,   perhaps with ice cream. Discard idea after getting whiff of noxious melted cellophane.  - Put cookie mass down disposal. - Peel melted plastic off oven rack, which comes off surprisingly easily. - Let oven air out a few minutes and put pizza in. Serve with applsauce and   milk.

       tedious grillin' (not for when you are high)   get some fresh asparagus. it should be a decent size and not that pencil thin stuff. i am serious. while you're at the store, also pick up some soy sauce, sesame oil, a garlic bulb and some sesame seeds. ok, soak some bamboo skewers for a couple hours in water. get two skewers, and use them to make raft looking things out of the asparagus - put one through the bottom of the stalk and one about two inches up from that. be careful to do it through a thick part, or your asparagus might break and you'll get all pissed off and throw it really hard at the sink. each raft should have something like 6-8 stalks of asparagus on it.  ok, is your grill ready? if it's not, you had better turn it on now. while it is warming up, put one tablespoon of soy sauce and two tablespoons of sesame oil and a couple cloves of minced garlic in a bowl and stir them all around. carry your plate of asparagus rafts, the marinade bowl and the sesame seeds outside to the grill. brush one side of the rafts with the marinade and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. put it marinade side down on the grill, and brush the top (unmarinated) side with the marinade and give it some seeds too. turn it over after about 3 minutes and let the other side cook for about that long. use your own good judgment to tell when they're cooked enough. i trust you.  maybe you want to grill some other stuff too. don't worry. just wrap your rafts in some foil and put them in the oven on the "warm" setting. they'll just sit and happily marinate a little more and be great when whatever else you are grilling is done. i am serious about not trying to do this while you're high. many have tried, few have succeeded. enjoy your goddamn rafts.

       hell yeah! a snack!   this is pretty easy to make. the only trouble is having the right ingredients on hand all at the same time since your babydaddy likes avocados too and might eat them first.  anyway. acquire half of a ripe avocado. cut it into flattish pieces. put the pieces on some bread. take another piece of bread and put a piece of monterey jack cheese on it. put your bread and ingredients together and you have a great sandwich! you do!!! you are a beautiful butterfly. a good dessert for this snack is a bowl of that new s'morez cereal without milk.

       urlLink nerdy girl rebecca  is a loser:   Loser Sandwich   The situation: You would make burritos if you could, but all you have is tortillas and a can of refried beans.  The cheese has gone bad to the point where you can't just cut off the moldy parts and use the rest and you've got no veggies that you're willing to touch at this point, even if it means getting them out of the refrigerator and into the trash where they rightfully belong.  You are considering a call to HAZMAT as broccoli is surely not supposed to look like that.  At least you think it was broccoli.  With the burrito plan down the drain, you decide to settle for a sandwich, but the bread is even moldier than the cheese, except for that baguette you purchased on a whim two weeks ago and never ate (hard as a rock).  Also, you don't seem to have adequate sandwich fixin's available.  Solution: Not to despair!  You've got peanut butter, right?  And tortillas.  Spread peanut butter over half of a tortilla.  Then it's just a matter of finding something complimentary to top off the peanut butter.  I prefer Cool Whip or, if it's available, some good, old fashioned honey.  Other possibilities include syrup, jelly, and powdered sugar.  If you're not in the mood for something sweet, consider ketchup or experiement with other condiments.  Or, if you've just ended a relationship, you've probably got some chocolate syrup lying around, so you might as well just squeeze that out on top of the peanut butter.  Fold tortilla in half and enjoy.

       Popped My Cherry Pan Mushrooms   - Be struck by the delicious prospect of fried, breaded mushrooms in your very own home! Purchase them at your corporate food emporium of choice.  - They've sat in the freezer for a while, and now you're ready to tuck in. Open the box. Do not be dissuaded by the clumped frozen mass that is the entire contents of the box. Refer to directions. Think: oh, shit. I thought this was an oven thing. Well, it isn't! You need a Fry Daddy. Don't have one? Break out that frying pan, tiger! Whoops - where's the vegetable oil? Thank god, you've got some.  - Cover bottom of pan w/ veg. oil. Turn up that heat - but not too much! When shit seems hot, dump in that frozen, breaded mass that is your tasty mushrooms.  - Oh shit! The clumped mass is burning on one side! Turn that shit quick!  - Ok, it's black on one side. No worry; it's just crispy. Figure: you'll just cook 'em till their soft. Think about which salad dressing remnant you're going to dip this shit in, and how great  that'll  make it taste.  - Admit that the fuckers are black beyond belief now, and taste like pan. Taste. Nope, you were wrong! They taste like  ass.   - Turn off stove, let the shit cool, then bag it up and toss it. Or, if you have no pets, just toss the nasty shit.  - Order pizza. Drink all inebriates within reach. If no money, find friend or other loser associate to enable such end.

       White, Charming Trash   Look at the price of fresh asparagus and balk. But buy it anyway, it's better than fetid. Boil or steam the asparagus. I don't know how long because I just keep chomping into a test one to see if it's done. Take it out of water when it's at desired consistency and let cool. Now take the whitest bread you know (Wonder is better than French) and spread a little butter on some slices, a little cream cheese on others. Then roll the cooled asparagus in the white bread. Yes, the crusts  must  be cut off beforehand.  Cut the rolls in half or into more bite-size pieces.  Arrange on lovely Melmac serving dishes. Wear pearls. Garnish with cocktail(s). Well, always garnish meal with cocktail(s).

       Oatmeal Pan     Set oven to 375 degrees. Make sure there's nothing in it, like a baking pan, aluminum foil, or a plastic bowling ball. Double check for those bowling balls, because they are black, easy to miss, and make one hell of a stinky mess when they melt.   Start with two and a half sticks of butter. Read the directions, discovering you have to beat this into 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of regular sugar.   Fuck that. Nuke the butter for a minute or so until it's melted, then beat in the sugars.   Toss in a raw egg. It's generally better to remove the shell first, but that's just me.   Add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Resist the urge to chug the vanilla bottle. It's never worth it.   Mix everything together. Note how the egg white forms this "window" into the rest of the mix. It's all yellow, except for where the brown sugar shows through.   Stare at the directions some more and think to yourself that you should have read it sooner and mixed this shit beforehand.   Take the box of baking soda out of the fridge, remove one teaspoon, dump it in the mix. If you just put the box in the mix, start over and figure out the damn pronoun correctly, dumbass. Then put the box back in the fridge so it can continue to suck up the fungal odor from all the rotting leftovers.   Add in one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Mix well.   Add in one and a half cups of flour. Mix quickly. Continue until you feel the burn in your forearms.   Add in three cups of oats. Mix well. If you're doing this correctly, you will end up with Popeye-sized forearms. This is a harmless side effect, unless you're in that 0.01% of the population who lives with a multi-jointed skinny woman and a very large mumbling man. These people should take spinach quickly, rather than putting up with the five minutes of abuse that's sure to follow before you finally get pissed off enough to  finally  take it.   Form the batter into lumps and put them on an ungreased cookie sheet.   Get all macho and fit the entire mix on to the cookie sheet at once. Feel proud.   Lick your fingers. You'll die from the salmonella in the raw egg, but who cares? It's delicious!   Put the cookies in the oven to bake for 8-9 minutes. Or, more like fifteen, because it never looks right after just nine.   Remove the cookie sheet. The lumps have now flattened and merged into a gigantic lumpy mass with a handful of gaps where you didn't put the lumps close enough together.   Use a knife to cut the mass into squarish or circlish shapes. Resist the urge to look up "squarish" and "circlish" in the dictionary.   Eat. Do not share.

      Mott Cromby has  urlLink a friend  and he's a cooking loser, too   Gourmet Vegetable Melt   1 bag of frozen peas, corn, or other favorite frozen vegetable 1 bag of shredded mozzerella cheese  First off, don't buy cheese in a chunk.  Don't kid yourself.  You're not going to shred it.  Just buy the pre-shredded stuff.  Sometimes it's actually cheaper. My pal Mott Cromby suggests that if you're really hard up, some crumbled-up Kraft Singles slices will suffice.  Pour vegetables into a normal soup/cereal bowl.  Fill the bowl almost to the top; some settling will occur during cooking.  Gently jiggle the bowl so that the top of the vegetable pile becomes fairly flat.  Sprinkle mozzerella cheese generously over the veggies.  Don't be afraid to use too much - cheese just molds in the fridge anyway.  If you're feeling adventurous, fill the bowl halfway, sprinkle with cheese, then pour in more veggies and sprinkle again.  It's like a layer cake, with no cake.  Microwave for five or six minutes.  This is longer than it seems like it should take, but remember, these are some densely packed frozen veggies.  There will be a few in the middle that won't ever thaw no matter how long you microwave them.  The goal is to get most of the vegetables at least soft and the cheese melted.  You can always entertain yourself by watching the bowl spin around and pinching more shredded cheese from the bag.  When you remove the bowl from the microwave, it will be hot.  Microwaves heat dishes just as much as food, regardless of the hype.  If you don't have oven mitts - and you don't - a towel or two will do, as will the overly long sleeve of your shirt.  If you're lucky, some of the cheese will have dribbled down in the cracks between the veggies and combined with the melted ice that formerly encrusted said veggies to form a smooth, watery cheese sauce.  Most of it will remain in a rapidly hardening shell on top. Stab repeatedly with fork and enjoy!

       Imperial Chicken    You need:  * some boneless skinless chicken breasts (4 is good, but whatever) * 1 1/2 to 2 cups of breadcrumbs (put some slices of bread in the oven on 250 for about 20-30 minutes if you need to make them) * Parmesan cheese, maybe 1/2 a cup - here's where I'm going to get picky on your ass. Get some decent Parmesan, if you can. That powdered shit just isn't going to cut it. Di Giorno Parmesan, which can be found in most deli cases by the other cheese, is pretty good for this recipe. Any actually-grated Parmesan will do. * spices like oregano, basil, parsley (Italian Seasoning works fine) * a stick of butter or margarine (1/2 cup) * some garlic - garlic powder works ok, I guess, if you're a total loser, but aspire to something better and get real garlic...either pre-minced in a jar or fresh. * juice of half a lemon (dude, if you don't have this, don't panic) * Some milk (or mayonnaise, or both) * paprika (if you don't have this, don't panic either)  In some kind of container or bowl, mix together about a cup and a half to two cups of bread crumbs with a big handful of Parmesan cheese, a bunch of spices (you've got to do some individual thinking here), salt and pepper to taste. Set aside for a bit.  In the interim, melt the stick of butter with the garlic and juice of half a lemon (i.e. cut a small lemon in half, rid yourself of most of the seeds, squeeze actual lemon over the small saucepan into the butter & garlic). If you don't have a lemon, things will turn out all right anyway.  Get out the chicken breasts. Run them under the kitchen faucet a few seconds and dry them with a paper towel. Then, dunk them in the milk (a mixture of milk and a couple of tbsp of mayo works well for better cohesion, or you can just put some mayo, but they'll be a little greasier). For gods sake, dunk them in something so the breadcrumbs will stick.  After dunking them or mayo-ing them, roll them in the bread crumb mixture. Lay in a 13x9 baking pan (which will fit a maximum of 5 large chicken breasts). Repeat until all chicken breasts are breaded and laid. When breasts are arranged in the pan, dump the remaining breadcrumb mixture over them evenly. Drizzle the butter/garlic/lemon crap over the breaded chicken breasts evenly. Throw some more parmesan cheese over the top of it all. Sprinkle with paprika. If you don't have paprika, it's clearly not going to matter. Do without, if you must.  Put the baking dish with the chicken, etc. in it into the oven, which is set to 350 degrees, for about 40 minutes. After that, take everything out of the oven and serve with a salad or rice or both or something.  Get fat. Be happy.

WHen they are done spread them on a cookie sheet. Salt and pepper them and then douse them with the mustard vinagrette. When they have cooled stir in the rest of the ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate until serving time.   Mustard vinagrette. just use equal parts white vinegar and olive oil. Add dijon and salt and pepper and dried thyme til it tastes to your liking. (some people like more vinegar than others) IMPORTANT NOTE: crappy  olive oil = crappy food.

        Tomato and Basil Sandwiches       You'll need:    * Some mayo (or Nayo, but ick).  * Four slices of nice soft white bread. If your grocery store has that "Kid's Choice" white or the equivalent, grab it.  * One big red ripe tomato, sliced into approximately 6-8 slices. Don't buy that 6-pack, 99-cent, picked-green-off-the-vine shit. Pay the god-forsaken extra 20 cents for a real tomato. The best case scenario is waiting until the beginning of July and purchasing some lovely red home-grown gems from a vegetable stand, much like the one my grandparents have every year. In desperation, grocery store tomatoes must be tolerated.  * Swiss cheese. One bread-sized slice is enough for one sandwich, so you're going to need two.  * Approximately 10-12 basil leaves. Fresh basil can be found in the produce section of your local supermarket. If it cannot, you should plot a store bombing and then shop at Trader Joe's before making this recipe.    Instructions:    Put some mayo on one side of those four slices of that delicious bread.  On two slices, put a big slice of Swiss cheese.  On the other two slices, arrange 5-6 leaves of basil each to cover bread, just as if it were lettuce.  On top of the basil, lay 3-4 thick slices of tomato.  Slap those sandwich halves together and eat! You made two sandwiches because that is how many you will want to eat, minimum.  Go take a good look in the mirror. You're not a loser anymore, babes.

Heat up a little canola in a pan. Toss chunks of seitan in, and of course, the vidalia onion. Look, people. I LIKE ONIONS, OK? Realize seitan is not completely defrosted. Have at it with one of your decent knives and then crank the heat up a little bit on the burner. Retrieve metal spatula from sink because this is the only spatula you have left since the plastic one caught fire last week. Move stuff around in pan. You know. Look for bread. Find whole wheat pitas in freezer. Defrost a few in the microwave. Move stuff around in pan again. Open another Anchor. Slice tomato. Coat inside of pita with Nayonnaise. Lick knife. Think to self  'goddammit, I will learn to like vegan mayonnaise. The taste of this will grow on me eventually. I swear' . Dump now brown seitan and onions in pita. Toss on some tomatoes and shredded cheese. Eat. Surprise self at how good it really is.

       Necanthrope  claims he's not a stoner but this recipe begs to differ.  INGREDIENTS  1 package of shredded cheese, mixed, preferably of dubious age 2 soft flour tortillas 1 dollop of olive oil  Very, very lightly coat the inside of a pan with the olive oil.  this is just  to slightly brown the tortillas.  I personally use the same pan that I cooked  hash browns in earlier, it works well after you drain it out and wipe it  down, leaving a slight residue of oil.  Place the pan on high heat, and place the first tortilla in it.  Sprinkle it  with cheese, trying not to get outside of the circle.  Good luck with that.   Make it as thick as you like.  I'm a huge fuckin' fatty, so I go pretty  heavy.   Place the second tortilla on top.  let it cook for 2 minutes, then flip it  over with a spatula.  the underside should be heavily browned by the oil.    Let cook for two more minutes.  Slide onto a plate and cut into quarters.  Voila!

       tuna loser casserole ii  or, i'm in a goddamn hurry and granola bars just aren't cutting it for dinner anymore  first, you need one cup of minute rice and a cup of water.  owning up to the fact that i have minute rice is embarrassing for me, so you should be proud of me for posting this. dump the rice and the water in a pyrex bowl.  microwave for five minutes.  use this time to look for your car keys.  when done, take the bowl out of the microwave and add: one can of cream of whatever soup one can of tuna.  amazingly enough, i had no cans of tuna, but some of those somewhat less loser-like hermetically sealed foil envelopes of tuna that costs about twice as much, so i used one of those instead.  stir the mess around until it looks somewhat uniform in consistency.  insert fork, cover in saran wrap and take to work.

      Guest loser Caitlin:   urlLink Styrofoamkitty  Banana Bread  3 over-ripe bananas 1 cup sugar 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter (melted) -- not margarine, or it will taste like ass 1 egg 2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans) or chocolate chips if you have a sweet tooth  mash bananas with a fork--they should be old and black because you bought them with all good intentions of eating healthier, but you suck, so you let them rot on the counter instead stir in sugar until it's a gloppy mess pour in butter, mix well beat in egg with a fork stir in flour and salt and baking soda just until mixed stir in nuts or chips  generously grease and lightly flour a loaf pan, pour in batter, bake 1 hour at 325 or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean  Viola, now you are a Baking Loser.  This bread, when stale, makes awesome french toast--don't do anything but fry it in some butter on both sides and serve it up with syrup.  Your pancreas will fail and you will go into congestive heart failure, but you will die happy.

        the BEST bowl of cereal ever     you will need:   - box of Fruity Pebbles - quart of heavy cream  It really should be after 1am for this recipe.  Strip to pajamas and turn the lights off.  Find Ron Popeil on TV.   Fill large bowl (like a salad bowl) with Fruity Pebbles.  Fill with heavy cream.  Microwave for 1 minute.    Repeat until you finish the entire box of Fruit Pebbles. DO NOT attempt this with any other cereal.

      From  urlLink  Kurt :  Cooking Loser Ramen a.k.a. Male Bachelor Ramen:   1: Place package of dry ramen on counter.  2: Crush noodles with fist, taking care not to pop open the bag and scatter your potential meal.  3: open package and remove seasoning packet  4: open seasoning packet, and dump onto ramen crumbs  5: close package and shake to distrubute seasoning  6: Consume with fingers, while standing over sink, wash down with beer.   actually, this was what I, and my friends used to eat for recess when we were in the third grade   also this:  Mom is looking in the kitchen cupboards:   Mom: "What happened to all the Jello?"  Myself: "I ate it"  Mom closes door looks incredulously at myself  Mom: "You ate it?"  Myself: "I ate it for recess snack"  Mom: "Who made it?"

       Orgasm-Inducing Coconut Macaroons  One big bag of Baker's Angel Flake Coconut one 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk 2 teaspoons vanilla  Preheat oven to 350. mix that shit up in a big bowl.  Grease a cookie sheet like your life depended on it.  Seriously, you may think it's greasy enough?  But it's not.  Grease it some more.  I like the spray-oil like Pam, only I use the organic kind because I'm a fruit.  Drop the cookies onto a tray with teaspoons.  Use the tines of a fork to push the errant little coconut flakes back onto the cookies.  Mash them a little so they're not TOO round, but not until they're flat, either.  Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool on wax paper or a cookie rack.  Wipe off the cookie sheet with a paper towel and re-grease the cookie sheet for the next batch.  Rinse the spatula between batches, too.    These are best after a couple of days, sitting in Glad-Ware or something.  They get really chewy and yum.  Enjoy!

Apologizing in advance,   pie  From  urlLink Stu Savory , it's the               RECIPE FOR MAKING LOVE     INGREDIENTS:                              4 Laughing eyes                             4 Well-shaped legs                             4 Loving arms                             2 Firm milk containers                             2 Nuts                             1 Fur-lined mixing bowl                             1 Firm banana   DIRECTIONS :                1. Look into laughing eyes.                2. Spread well-shaped legs with loving arms.                3. Squeeze and massage milk containers very gently.                4. Gently add firm banana to mixing bowl,                     working in and out until   well creamed. For best results, continue to                     knead milk containers.                5.

       Buta Dofu   urlLink Pink Lotus   makes this one:  I make buta dofu, which is sliced pork and tofu in a miso sauce. It's really easy and you can serve it over rice. If you're veggie, take out the pork and add some spinach.     Brown meat.  Deglaze pan with sake.  Combine 1/4 c. miso with 1/4 or so of water.  Add cubed tofu to pan with spinach.  Pour miso over tofu.  Add a tblsp. or more of soy sauce (and a little more sake).  Cook until everything's warm.

       Tofu & Rice  Put 1 cup rice on to boil with 2 cups water.  Put a little salt in there, cover it with a lid, when it starts to boil, put the heat on so low, it's almost out.  Don't stir the rice.  Steam for 20 minutes, or until done.   (I like brown rice, but it takes 40 minutes, and we are losers, so screw that.)  While rice is steaming:    Oven to 350.  Pour a little oil into a cookie sheet that's got sides on it---roll the pan around so the oil coats evenly, or use that Pam cooking spray.  Let it heat up in the oven.  Mix up some curry powder with some loose bullion powder (of your choosing--I prefer vegetarian beef) (you can use salt and pepper if you are lame) in a big plastic baggie.  Drain a cube of Firm Tofu.  Wrap it in a clean kitchen towel and gently press the excess water out of the tofu block.  Cut the tofu into strips or cubes.  Put it in the baggie.  Shake, shake, shake your booty.  Arrange the tofu strips / cubes on the hot oil tray so that they're not touching.  The tofu should sizzle when you put it on the tray.  Bake for about 5-10 minutes, until the bottoms start to look browned and crispy.  Turn with a spatula at this point.  Cook another 5 minutes to brown the other side.  Remove and drain on paper towels.    Turn the oven off.    Check the rice.  Throw some frozen broccoli in a bowl.  Salt it, throw a pat of butter on top.  Nuke it for 2-3 minutes.     Voila.  Baked curry tofu, rice and broccoli.  You will be a cooking loser no more.

      From Rosie:   So I had a girlie night with a friend who recently dumped her boyfriend so we could have dinner, wine, and whine.  In the end, we chronically dieting girls nixed the honey glazed salmon with shiitakes and sesame spinach in favor for nachos and beer.  Low fat nachos and light beer, but good nonetheless.   Nachos for Nuerotics:   1/2 bag good nacho chips 1 can low fat turkey chili (Trader Joe's preferred) 1 heap of guacamole for cheaters (mash two avocados, one jalapeno, a fist full of chopped oregano, and a dollop op salsa) light or fat free sour cream salsa jalapenos olives   Put a layer of chips in casserole dish.  Sprinkle with cheese and pretend it is soy cheese.  More chips.  More cheese.  Microwave chili until hot and pour on top of chips and cheese.  Put in pre-heated 350 degree oven for about a beer (ten minutes?  a little less?).  Remove from oven and top with all other goo.  Drink with light beer and feel proud that you have convinced yourself you are eating light and it only SEEMS unhealthy!

       Poor Man's Tiramisu  from Panacea  Take two slices stale Wonder Bread (or other disgustingly soft, white bread that you know is made with paste instead of whatever they put in health food bread).  Toast lightly.  If it's stale enough, you don't have to toast it at all.  Spread Nutella (tm) or other chocolate spread on one piece of bread. Spread cream cheese on the other.  You could use mascarpone but you're a poor loser and that shit is expensive, so philly will do.  Assemble sandwich with the sticky sides in.  If you can't figure out how to do this, you are more of a loser than I thought.  Cut sandwich into three or four "fingers" and dunk in cold coffee, as strong as you can get it.  Play Billy Joel's "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant" in the background and pretend you are there.

       Supah Easy Hummus   Ingredients:  One can garbanzo beans At least part of a bulb of garlic.  Or, if you're going for total loser, a jar of that minced/crushed garlic A lemon, if you really care A jar of tahini sauce (you can find it most places now.  take a look in the 'ethnic' sections of your major-chain grocery store.) Olive oil Paprika Carrots and/or pita bread and/or bagel chips and/or sourdough bread  Open can of garbanzo beans.  Leave lid in place as you strain water into a good-sized bowl.  Dump beans sans bean water into blender.  Open jar of tahini.  Take a spoon and glop in one or two spoonfuls into blender.  Ratio?  I dunno.  Go easy on the tahini.  It tastes bland and all, but it really takes over if you use too much.  I'd say if you've got a medium-sized can of garbanzos (chickpeas, in case you don't know they're the same thing), a heaping tablespoon (or big spoon out of your flatware drawer) should do you fine for now.  Take a little of the bean water and pour it into the blender.  Not too much.  Take garlic cloves, like maybe two or three smallish ones for one can of garbanzos, crush them, put mushy garlic in blender.  If you're using pre-crushed stuff, about a teaspoon is good.  Or, like, twice as much as what you'd put on your toothpaste if the garlic were toothpaste.  Remember, you can taste it later and add more if you need.  Blend it!  Aww yeah, blend blend blend.  Get a long-handled spoon to mush the whole beans down in case it all gets mucked up and stuck down by the blades.  Add a little more bean water if it's really cement-like, but not too much!  Blend until it's the consistency of oatmeal, and then squeeze the juice of 1/3 of a nice-sized lemon into it.  Blend until fairly smooth, but lumps are OK.  Scoop hummus onto a shallow bowl or platter, and smoosh it with the flat of a spoon until it's all even - you can get fancy and kinda make ridged patterns across the top like you'd do with frosting a cake.  Take your bottle of olive oil and sploosh a little across the surface of the hummus.  Not too much!  Then dust with paprika.   Wow, it looks so nice!  Scoop it up with baby carrots or pita bread, or even toast up some sourdough and use it as a spread on that.  You can even make sandwiches with it, you know, cut up a red onion, get some sprouts, a slice of a soft white cheese, maybe some turkey ...

       Chocolate Pound Cake  From  urlLink The Church Ladies' Divine Desserts  book, which you should go buy because you wish you cooked like a southern baptist black woman.  (Reprinted completely without permission, but really, go buy that book.)  2 sticks butter 1/2 cup shortening 3 cups sugar 5 large eggs 6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder pinch of salt 1 cup whole milk 1 tablespoon vanilla powdered sugar  Preheat the oven to 325.   Cream together the butter, shortening, sugar and eggs in a gigantic mixing bowl.  Seriously, find a really big one, you'll thank me for this later.  Use an electric mixer and beat until creamy. In a small bowl, combine the milk and vanilla. In a medium bowl, sift together the cocoa, flour, baking powder and salt. Add a third of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, beating with the mixer until combined.   Add a third of the milk mixture to the butter mixture.  Beat well.  Keep alternating the flour and milk mixture to the batter until it's all combined. Grease and flour a large Bundt pan.   Pour in the batter.   Bake 1 hour, 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.   Cool slightly, remove from pan.  Sift powdered sugar over the cake.   Serve to your rich granny and she'll die happy and leave you all her money.  I'm baking this cake right now, and after licking the batter off my finger, I think I came a little.  I'm not joking.   xo styro.

      Pizza Doubleheader from Anya   Pizza Florentine   Ingredients:  Pizza crust or thin focaccia bread 1 jar alfredo sauce 1 chicken breast 1 package frozen chopped spinach 2+ cups. fontina, smoked mozzarella, or whatever good melting cheese you prefer 1.5 T. olive oil 2-3 cloves garlic Cajun seasoning (not mandatory) Cayenne pepper (optional)  Instructions:  Unwrap crust and brush on olive oil. Using a garlic press, crush garlic onto crust and spread around on crust evenly. Bake at 350 degrees just until crust starts to change color (you don’t want to cook the crust anymore or else it will burn later). Next heat up an iron skillet, or other pan if you don’t have a skillet. I like to season my chicken with my Dad’s Cajun seasoning, which basically is just an all purpose meat seasoning. Emeril’s will do or just some S & P if you don’t have any of those. While you are doing this defrost the spinach in the microwave per the directions. Next grill the chicken in the pan until cooked. Remove and “pull” the chicken which just means shred it with two forks. Take out the spinach and drain with your hands. Grate your cheese, depending on how much you prefer. Spread the alfredo sauce on the crust just enough so you can’t see the crust. I like a light sprinkling of cayenne pepper so I put it on now so that it doesn’t all stick to my lips and burn the fire out of me; if you don’t like spicy foods, leave it off. Next sprinkle the cheese on, a rule of thumb for pizza cheese is no sauce showing through, but I like extra cheese so I add more. (Save some cheese for the end though.) Then add the drained spinach, you won’t need it all, probably only about ¾ of the package. Next add the chicken. Last, sprinkle the rest of the cheese on; this will keep the chicken from falling off when you cut and pick up the pizza slice. Bake at 400 degrees until the pizza is golden brown and the middle of the pizza is bubbly.  You can add or change this pizza to your liking. I often add black olives, pepperoni, feta cheese or blue cheese.  and 	  Pizza a la ex-boyfriend   This was my ex’s favorite recipe.  First you must get high and eat all of my granola bars as an hors devours, in one sitting. Be sure to leave a granola trail around the house especially in the bathroom near the toilet. (EW!)  You’ll need one Totino’s frozen combo pizza Crush up half a bag of my favorite croutons, please leave the bag open so they are stale for me later Rip up some of that nasty processed orange crap you call cheese, maybe 2 or 3 Strategically throw it all on top of your combo pizza Don’t forget the layer of black pepper and salt Bake at anywhere from 250-525, (depending on how high you are or if you have been hanging out with Jack this evening) Swear when the over starts smoking from the orange plastic dripping off the pizza onto the burners. Eat your culinary masterpiece at warp speed being sure to burn your tongue and lips. Wash down with a Heineken, or 7.  As for dessert, empty a bag of Swanson chicken nuggets onto the cookie sheet, cook and eat.  Don’t forget the lake of Ranch dressing you simply must have to accompany your dish.  Trust me, this will be a hit with all the family.

       Pesto Linguine, Balsamic Grilled Chicken, Garlicky Green Beans   Put the coals on the grill and get the grilll good and hot.  (All the coals should be covered in ash and red on the inside, but not flaming any longer.)  Marinate boneless chicken breasts in a gallon-size Ziplock with 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/3 cup olive oil, juice of one lemon, a tablespoon of rock salt and some freshly ground pepper.    While chicken is marinating, make the pesto. Boil whole wheat pasta according to package directions.  Drain and stir in a little olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking.  Puree together about 1 cup fresh basil, 3-4 cloves (NOT bulbs, genius) garlic, 1/4 cup pine nuts, 1/4-1/2 cup olive oil and a handful of freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Put some salt and pepper in there to taste.  Stir pesto into pasta.  Leave out on counter to become room-temp.  Take an old rag, soak it in vegetable oil (any kind will do) and grease down the grill before you put it over the hot coals.  (This is so the chicken doesn't stick.)  Cook the chicken breasts about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through.  (Test them by cutting one of the thickest parts with a knife.)  Flip only once, and cook covered.  While chicken is cooking, get a frying pan somewhat hot on the stove.  Crush two cloves of garlic with the flat side of a knife, and throw them in the hot pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil and a tablespoon of butter.  When the butter is melted, throw in about a half pound of green beans.  Stir them around a little to get them good and oily, and throw in a handful of pine nuts if you like.  This is where I also put some rock salt into the pan, but you can use regular salt if you're a total loser.  Let them cook about 5 minutes, stirring a couple of times so they don't burn.  The pan will probably smoke a little, so unplug the battery in your fire alarm.   When the beans are done (taste testing them is the only way to test for firmness), put them in a bowl, squeeze a little fresh lemon juice on top.  I also made garlic bread:  Smash 2 cloves of garlic and melt them in 2 tablespoons of butter and a little salt.  Cut a loaf of crusty bread on the diagonal and put it on a piece of tin foil.  Drizzle the butter over the cuts in the bread.  Bake in the oven at 350 while you make the beans.  Voila.  You are a goddamn genius.  Just like me.

      from Catherine, at http://berlinblog.blogspot.com   Kiss the Cook    Yesterday, my husband instant messaged me with this: "The basic underpinnings of a gas grill are really quite simple: First come burners to create heat. Above them you'll find some type of system to disperse the heat from the burners. Above those lie the cooking grates. Let's look under the hood to get a better sense of what you should be looking for."    What hood?    "Do you want gas or charcoal,"  he continued, using the psychology of a parent who avoids a "no" by not allowing "no" to be a choice.   "Charcoal," I thought. I could see bricks glowing half white. Matches and lighter fluid.  Sooty hands.  No scary gas grills with propane tanks that explode and result in warehouse fires.  No dials that go "click . . . click . . . click" like a bomb.   Why do we even have to get a grill?  Can't we do take out all summer?  Work hard and come home to someone else's home cooking.  Sounds like summer to me.  Or how about a blender?  We could get a blender instead.      But what I said was, "Well, I prefer charcoal, but if we get gas, we can use it all year round, even when it snows."    This grill attraction is such a guy thing.  Why not get as excited over the prospect of making long-cooked oatmeal at the kitchen stove?  Heat, food, utensils.  It's all the same, and safer and no flies or mosquitoes.  So I raised the subject in the office.  "Hey guys, what do you think about cooking outside?"   urlLink Bill  said all in one breath and without a pause: "You know what kind you want get a big one but don't fall for the external burner and don't go nuts with accessories I bought the cast iron box for wood chips but chips wrapped in aluminum foil packages work better you want a brush with a long handle but those forks and spatulas are pointless."    okaaaaaay.     Other responses:   "Don't ask me.  I don't grill.  I burned pasta on the stove once.  I dropped one pre-cooked piece of spaghetti into the burner, and the flame travelled up the length of the piece and caught the rest of the pasta sticking out of the too-small pan.  The sink was full of dishes.  I had to put it out in the bathtub. "   "I had a hamburger catch fire in a toaster oven once."    "When i was about five, we had a beer keg that my stepfather rigged up and we used as a grill. After grilling for dinner, we played dodge ball.  Running from the ball, I tried to hide behind the beer keg-grill, and put both palms on it to duck.  I spent the next 4 hours in the emergency room with second degree burns on my palms."    "We never grilled.  My dad drank instead.  If he ever got close to a grill, I think he would have caught on fire."   It sounded like the set of News Radio.

       Loaves and Fishes  (feeds 1, not 5000)  Pull package of Tilapia out of freezer. It's the kind in the blue packaging. Note that on the back is a blurb that this is the fish the Jesus H. Christ himself used at the loaves and fishes hoedown in Galilee a few years ago. Wonder if the company is run by fundamentalists. Wonder why you bothered going grocery shopping if this is really going to make that much.  Also note that you don't really know how to make fish.  But the first step is defrosting, so you set it in a bowl of water for a while.  While waiting on that, dig through fridge for side dishes. Find a package of store brand crescent rolls that expired in December. Figure they won't kill you if they have to be baked at 375 degrees.   Hey! The fish has thawed. Pull out largest frying pan you have and toss some olive oil and roasted garlic in there. Get it warming up on low heat. Beat one egg and a little milk in a bowl . NO NO NO, don't drink it. Dip the fish in there and then in some of those Progresso Dago Breadcrumbs in the blue can.  Not in the blue can itself, but on a plate. Get the fish slowly frying in the pan and preheat the oven. While preheating, hear something pop. It's the rolls, because you set them on top of a preheating oven. Consider a few of them a casualty and arrange the rest on an airbake sheet and shove it in the oven. Turn the fish. Wait a bit. Pour self glass of milk. Fish is done!. Drain them on a few paper towels.   Now, using the olive oil and garlic still in the pan, toss in a bucket of mushrooms that were about to go anyway and some red onion. Crank the heat to HOT HOT HOT and when the onions are about carmelized, the rolls are finished, and there you have it. Dinner.   Grab Brita pitcher out of fridge. Pour into goblet stolen from an ex boyfriend. Notice that it doesn't turn into wine.

       whole roasted chicken with lemon, parsely and garlic   ingredients:  1 small roasting chicken, whole 1 lemon, sliced thinly 2 cups parsley, stemless 3 cloves garlic, minced butter  salt and pepper  preheat oven to 425°F  wash chicken and cavity, removing neck, gizzards, etc.  season inside of cavity with salt and pepper.  using a knife if needed, pull the skin away from the meat, but don't remove it.  stuff the skin with minced garlic, parsley and lemon slices.  fill as much of the skin as possible.  brush the outside of the chicken with butter, season with salt and pepper, and put in the oven.  cook on one side for 35-45 minutes, basting with either butter, its own juices or both.  carefully turn over and continue cooking (another 25-35 minutes usually) basting at least once.  remove when juices run clear and skin is golden brown.  let cool, and serve.  *this is so simple, easy, smells and tastes delicious, and gives people the impression you are skilled in the kitchen.  though the cooking time is long, it affords you the chance to make side dishes, drink copious amounts of white wine, or chat.

      Squash!  Take a pyrex baking dish or sturdy cookie sheet and spray it evenly for five seconds with Pam butter cooking spray.  Preheat oven to 400&deg;F.  Cut one acorn squash and one butternut squash lengthwise.  Find a knife with a bit of a serrated edge, or else you will find yourself with a handy new weapon called Knife-cum-squash as the sharp single blade seals itself inside the hard rind.  Once you've more or less split those fuckers in half, take a spoon and scoop out the near pumpkin-like seeds and dump them into the trash.  Lay each half fleshy side down in the baking dish/sheet.  Slide dish/tray into oven.  Set timer for 40 minutes, or go watch an episode of the X-Files you have on tape, fast-forwarding through the commercials, natch.  At 40 minutes, turn the halves over so their fleshy underbellies show to the sky.  Go another ten minutes at full blast.  Bring the dish/sheet out, and let cool for one or two minutes.  Pinning down the halves carefully with a fork, scoop out the mushy (cooked sweet potato consistency) insides onto your plate.  Salt, pepper, cinnamon, brown sugar, whatever you think might go well with this somewhat sweet squash.  Me, I didn't have brown sugar, and I like savory, so after the cinnamon, I added a really tiny pinch of ground cumin.  Whatever floats your boat.  Add a bit of some butter product (or sour cream, if you want the baked potato effect), and dig in.  It's quite filling.  Very healthy.  I really shouldn't have posted something so healthy to this blog.  Sorry about that.  It won't happen again.  Add more sour cream to the damn squash if you're a true cooking loser.  More butter, more syrup.

      DAYMENTED'S LUNCH AT WORK a tomato and an avocado. Chop up both, put in bowl, add salt & pepper.  If I'm special and have un-moldy bread, I'll mush up the above and add a slice of pepperjack cheese and there's a sandwich. It's better with toasted bread, but we don't have a toaster at work.

      Chicken Parmesan  Ingredients:  Two (or more) chicken breasts 1 Egg, beaten Parmesan cheese Seasoned bread-crumbs  Beat the egg in a bowl and dip chicken into the egg.  Once you've coated the chicken in the egg, you won't be able to tell which came first.  And it won't matter... but I digress.  Pour some Parmesan cheese on a plate and dip the chicken into the Parmesan, coating nicely on both sides.  Next, pour breadcrumbs onto a plate and repeat the same procedure, turning and moving chicken until it's covered nicely.  I have one of those George Foreman grills, and I love it for cooking meats and such.  This would also work in a pan with a bit of oil (to prevent sticking), or even baking it in the oven (350F for about 40 min or until chicken is completely done and white -not pink- all the way through).  On the GF grill, it takes maybe 15 minutes (give or take, depending on the size of your breasts), turning the pieces about half way through.  You can eat the chicken as is, or serve with your favorite pasta sauce and melt some lovely mozzarella cheese on top.   Tonight, I was hungry and not really up for the whole pasta and sauce thing, so I had the chicken plain.  It was lovely and tender and tasty.  Enjoy!

       Mom’s Chicken Casserole   Ingredients:  3 chicken breasts box of stuffing (I use Stove Top) can of peas (8-or-so-ounce size . . . feel free to use more if you  really  like peas) gravy (jars . . . whatever brand works for you . . . try 30 to 36 ounces)  Start by boiling the chicken breasts in advance; you want to give them time to cool, so I do this the night before and stick them in the refrigerator. Start the actual prep work by tearing the chicken breasts into little bits . . . putting the little bits into a medium-sized mixing bowl. It helps things go more smoothly if you toss some of the little bits to your Siamese cat who is meowing psychotically at your feet and threatening to jump on the counter. (And don’t CUT the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces because you’ll mess up the texture.  Geez .) Once you’ve finished tearing up those breasts (heh), dump in the peas and jars of gravy. Add some seasoning if you want; personally, I add a little pepper. Mix it all up with a handy-dandy mixing spoon.  Next, make the stuffing according to the directions on the box. While the water's boiling, find your casserole dish . . . preferably one with a top/lid. (Now, I should’ve added this to the prep work, as I couldn’t fucking  find  my casserole dish and had to settle for two smaller substitutes.) When the stuffing is done, use your mixing spoon to coat the sides of the casserole dish with the stuffing. Once the stuffing is even on the sides, dump in the chicken/pea/gravy mush. Ideally this will fill up and cover the stuffing area. Put the lid on your casserole dish and put the dish in the oven. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes with the lid on, and another 15 minutes with the lid off.   Goes nice with dinner rolls and cheap white table wine . . . perhaps a $6 Riesling.   NOTE: If you use more chicken (like I did), compensate with more gravy and a bigger casserole dish. Otherwise, your casserole will be dry.

       Chicken, Stuffing and Cans of Stuff   1) Get a glass rectangular thing whats good for baking. 2) Put three tablespoons of butter in it. The stuffing box says &frac14; cup, but you don't need that much artery clogging goo. 3) Nuke a cup and a half of water for a minute or three. 4) Pour hot water slowly over butter, thus melting and mixing it the easiest way. 5) Set oven to 375 because you forgot to do it earlier. 6) Get four chicken breast halves, remove fat and skin and ickies and shit. Yes, shit. There's shit on almost all chicken. That's why you wash your hands so much when this is over, optionally moving slowly from side to side and murmuring about leper outcasts unclean. 7) Dump box of stuffing into butterwater. Don't bother mixing it or fluffing it or anything, as long as it's even. 8) Slap those chicken breasts on top of the stuffing. Wash hands again. 9) Discover some lovely hot sauce, the kind that leaves blisters. Put it on just one of the chickens, because the kiddies you are also cooking for are little babies who cry when they lose 0.5% of their tongue, much less the 67% this shit sloughs away. 10) Find an old can of enchilada sauce in the pantry. Shrug to yourself and pour it on the other three. 11) Pop the whole shebang, sans cover, into the oven for 30-40 minutes. 12) Yum.

       Second Cousin to Wicked Good Pumpkin Seeds   Cut open top of pumpkin, roll up your sleeves, and remove all the slimy seeds from the innards of le pumpkin.  Rinse them off as best you can, removing all the goo, etc.  Pre-heat oven to 300&deg;.  Pull out a cookie sheet and spread the seeds over it.  Take some olive oil, perhaps a tablespoon, and glomp it on top of the seeds.  Mush the seeds around until they're well-coated with the oil.  Take about a tablespoon of garlic powder, and sprinkle it over the seeds.  Mush around the seeds a bit to get the powder all over.  Repeat with Lawry's Seasoned Salt.  Mush mush mush.  Spread the seeds out again, and then slide the sheet into the oven.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Eat the seeds whole once they've cooled slightly.  Salty and savory.  Mmmm.

       Guest loser Anya eats lunch on a budget:   Wake up late and throw on some mascara and tie your hair up, because, ya’ know, if you’re late again you will be living with moms again. Since you have no time to steal some ravioli from your loser roommate, run out the door and hope that your clothes match. Make it to work on time, catch up on your daily blogs and your email till around 9:30. Finally it’s noon, time for lunch!! Remember you don’t have jack to eat. Scrounge around in the freezer, find that old Lean Cuisine somebody left that’s been sitting in there since before you started a year ago. Nuke it for 8 minutes to try and evaporate some of the melted ice block that was attached. Discover, to your astonishment, that it is definitely nasty as hell. Decide to drive to Wendy’s to get a Jr. Bacon Cheese since you borrowed a dollar from your neighbor you pretend to like. Hope you don’t run out of gas on the way; thank god Wendy’s is only a block away.

      Totally vegetarian penne pasta   Take 4 oz. uncooked pasta, put it in a bowl.  Take a big ol' pot, fill it with enough water that the pasta will be submerged and can swim around nicely in a big boil, and set it on your stove.  Turn that burner on high, and salt the water a tiny bit.  Grab a couple portabella mushroom caps, about a cup and a half of water or vegetable broth, and a splash (two tablespoons or so) of red cooking wine, and set it on a brisk simmer on another burner.  Crush some garlic - perhaps as much as a 1/3 of a bulb, put it in with the liquid the mushrooms are cooking in.  Water should be at a boil in the pot, so dump in the pasta.  I used a whole wheat pasta, and even though it said 10 minutes, I am not much of an al dente girl, so I went for 15.  The portabella should be nice and cooked by now, so go ahead and transfer the liquid and the shrooms to the canister that should have been packaged with your stick blender.  Blend the mushrooms and the garlic and the broth and the wine together, until you get this weird-looking sort of pesto goop out of it.  Drain the pasta, and put half of it into a shallow bowl.  Dump half of your pesto stuff in it.  For added substance and protein, take a Boca smoked sausage (fake meat! mmm.), nuke it, or fry it up according to the packaging, then chop half of it into small pieces and throw that in with your dish.  Pack up the other half of everything and stick it in a container to bring to work tomorrow.

       You guys. Help this poor girl out.    Dear Cooking Losers,  My roommates and I moved into a fab new house a couple months ago only to discover that the people who lived here before us at planted, oh, five million or so tomato plants in our yard.  Why could someone possibly need SO MANY tomatoes?  I do not know.  But they keep coming each and every day.  I have had ENOUGH of the salsa, the tomato sandwiches, the mozzarella salads.. We're running out of ideas here.  And so, I turn to you, cooking losers, with a request.  Please, please give me new and exciting ideas about what I can make with this abundance of tomatoes before they all go bad.  Thank you much,  urlLink jennn

       Beans. Rice. In the same place.    Find box of Zatarians long grain and wild rice in the pantry.  Ignore for months since rice is the food of last resort, much like soup.  Go broke. Consider box of rice again. Dig it out and discover a can of chili red beans.    so, you make the rice like it says on the box and about 15 minutes into the 25 that it's supposed to sit on the stove, you dump the can of beans in it. they're mild beans, so you liberally add some cayenne pepper to it. not great, but not half bad either.

       Pumpkin Soup   So you buy this pie pumpkin from the grocery store on a whim, right?  You've been cooking squash (dead easy), so you  should  have the hang of this, but you're a little nervous about roasting up a pumpkin.  Don't be.  Super easy, even for a loser like you.  Pre-heat oven to 425&deg;.  Cut pumpkin into quarters and cut out/scoop out with hands most of the goop and all of the seeds.  Wrap each quarter of the 'kin with tin foil so that it folds over at the top, like a little sealed pouch.  Before you do that, though, put a healthy pat of butter in the bowl of the quarter.  You can also take a bit of any of the following and dust the surface of the flesh before sealing: lemon pepper, garlic powder, allspice, or cinnamon.  Place the foil-wrapped quarters onto a cookie sheet, and slide into the super-hot oven.  Set that timer for 45 minutes.  When the timer goes off,  carefully  pry open one of the foil pouches and give the 'kin a good poke with a fork or spoon.  The flesh of the squash should be fairly soft, and considerably darker than when it was raw.  Ideally, you should be able to scoop out the flesh with a regular spoon without difficulty. If it's not done after 45, keep on re-admitting the pumpkin to the fiery depths of your stove in ten minute increments until it's done.  When you've achieved this, set the cookie sheet to cool for a few minutes, so you're not burning yourself with steaming hot lemon pepper butter mush.  Scoop as much as you can from each rind into a largish bowl.  Get out a potato masher, or, if you're a true loser, the biggest fork you can find.  Mush that stuff as smooth as possible.  If you're a faux loser, get out the stick blender and make that stuff a gorgeous orange puree.  Add enough chicken broth/water to make it a soupy consistency, and transfer this all to a pot where you'll have it on "Low."  Stir the goop as you slowly add stuff like: salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, allspice, cinnamon, sugar.  Do this to taste: I made mine a bit savory, but that's because I can't make my brain understand sweet soups, really.  Right before you're ready to serve/consume, add a small container of either half and half, or heavy whipping cream.  Turn off heat, so you don't scald the cream, and serve.  I got a bit jiggy wid it and added half of a green apple, diced into little tiny pieces.  It gave the soup a tart sweetness to remind you of pie, but it was definitely a savory soup.  Don't be afraid to add lots of seasonings - pumpkin can be pretty damn boring on its own.  It's only when you add all the flavorings that you start getting that recognizable pie thing going on.  I put two cinnamon sticks into the pot so that they would soak up moisture and then continue to season the leftovers as they sit in the fridge.

      "pasta con brocolli": 1. look through your fridge.  find that all you have is half an onion and a stalk of brocolli.  also, you have some condiments.  2. smell the onion and realize that it reaks.  more than onions are supposed to.  throw the half onion away.  get the brocolli out of the fridge.  3. look in the freezer.  find that all you have are five supermarket brand, frozen pizzas.  pull out a frozen pizza.  4. turn the oven on at 425 degrees.  you don't need to look at the pizza instructions to know the cooking temperature.  pizza is the only thing that you know how to cook in an oven, so that's the only oven temperature that you've ever used.  and you eat so many of these frozen pizzas that you have memorized the instructions.  5. wash and break apart the brocolli.  snap the stems so that your large brocolli tree becomes several small brocolli trees.  put them on the pizza.  6. put the pizza in the oven.  if you have a timer, set it for about 15 minutes.  or you can do the smell test.  when you can smell the pizza from where you are watching tv, it is done.  if it isn't done, it won't particularly matter.  because you are a starving bachelor who will eat anything and who no longer is concerned with things like adequate cooking or spending the rest of your life in a loveless and meaningless existence.  all you hope for, besides a decently cooked pasta con brocolli every once in a while, is that, when you die alone in your apartment, you will have had the foresight to put some pants on beforehand.    7. once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a while.  garnish with whatever you have lying around that you think might be good on it.  garlic salt and/or hot sauce seem to work well.    8. once the pizza is cooled, take it and sit down in your folding beach chair that you have in the living room because you needed some kind of seating to replace the couch your roommate took with him when he moved out.  pick up the entire pizza and eat it without cutting it at all.  normally, you could have cut it into slices.  but your roommate that moved out owned the pizza cutter, in addition to all of the knives.  9. use your lap as your dinner table and try to think of ways to rationalize to yourself why it would be acceptible to be as excited as you are about the recent introduction of the speed channel and tech tv to your cable tv lineup.    10. realize that there is no way to justify such a thing.  console yourself with the notion that eating so much of this "pasta con brocolli" on a regular basis will surely shorten your lifespan and put a mercifully early end to this farce that you call your personal life.

       Calamari 2.0   Find that local international grocery (Global Foods, 421 N Kirkwood Rd. Kirkwood, MO 63122) stocks pre cut frozen squid rings. Thank god. None of that gut, clean and slice crap from last year. Same international grocery also stocks english fish and chip batter. Totally cool.  A few weeks later a houseguest is over and suggests you make squid. Go to independent bookstore. Go down the street to another international grocery and fail to find cocktail sauce, but leave with crab chips, wasabi peas, and chinese biscuits. Stop at another grocery for a lemon and cocktail sauce.   Defrost squid in large plastic collander. Liberally squeeze half a lemon over it. Roll in flour and dip in the batter you've made according to the directions. Drop about 1- pieces at a time into pot of boiling canola (hint: boiling olive oil smokes and is gross. Canola works great). You have 2 MINUTES MAX to do this, any longer and you're going to end up with batter dipped Goodyear. Drain on layers of paper towels and eat with more lemon and cocktail sauce.

       Stew   Acquire a pound or so of stew meat from your local warehouse-type grocery sore. Slice it into pieces small enough that you won't choke on and massage a little generic seasoning on them. Let it sit in some burgundy from a box and red wine vinaigrette salad dressing overnight. Every few hours or whenever you think of it, pick up the tupperware with the meat and shake it, shake it, shake it like polaroid picture.   Sometime later the next day clean up your pot o'crock and dump in half a bag of sliced carrots, a few chopped up celery stalks,  diced red and white onions, and a chopped potato. 4 cups of water and a bag of Knorr soup mix follow. Ignore. 2 hours.  Toss the meat in. Watch everything turn purple. Ignore for a couple more hours. Make the egg noodles seperately. I tried to just toss those in with the stew once and they disintegrated into some sort of beef flavored paste. Gross.   Remove about 3 1/2 cups of the juice in the strew. You'll put this in a pot with some flour until you reduce it into gravy.   Serve on top of the noodles and maybe with some of those crescent rolls from a can.

      oh my gosh! the date was great! she came over! stayed the night! now it's 10am and... oh no! what's for breakfast?    Morning After French Toast   4 slices of bread 1 egg milk 1 banana honey or maple syrup cinnamon and/or nutmeg  Begin by warming up your Foreman Grill. Slice banana width-wise into 1/4" pieces. When the orange light indicates the grill is hot and ready, mix your egg in a bowl with a splash of milk and whisk together. Add in a dash of cinnamon and/or nutmeg.  Assemble a 'sandwich' by placing the banana slices between two pieces of bread. Carefully dip the sandwich into the egg mixture, laying the bread flat in the bowl and allowing the egg to soak in. Flip over and soak opposite side. When entire sandwich is coated in egg, place on Foreman Grill and close the lid. Cook approximately 5 minutes, or until egg is lightly browned and cooked thoroughly.   Slice sandwich diagonally for a nice presentation. Top with a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.

       SOME SORT OF BOSNIAN SALAD I TRIED TO REPRODUCE   Chop cucumbers.  As many as you want. I think I had 4.  Put half a container (approx 8 oz) of plain yogurt on top of that. Make sure you get the yogurt with the arabic label from the international grocery store. Oh my, is it ever yummy. Have I ever told you people how much I love dairy products? I could eat it plain with a spoon. I could also do that with sour cream and wash it down with whole milk, but I digress. Rip up some little pieces of cilantro and toss that on top. Put the lid on the tupperware and shake it until everything is pretty much evenly coated. Eat. And eat. And eat.

       COBBLAH   Melt 1 stick o'butter in a 13x9 glass pan. I don't know the temperature. Supposed to be 375, but my oven is way way off, so I put it at 450.  I really need to get an oven thermometer and see just how off it is.   Mix 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugah, 1 cup milk, 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon in a bowl.  Once the butter has melted, pour all this stuff in the glass pan. It will look soupy, that's all ok. Patience, child.  Add 2 cans of apricot halves. I used the lite kind in pear juice. Also one can o'peaches. Again, I used the light can in juice. Not that syrupy spooge.  Bake until done.  Serve to self and other person of choosing. Eat half the pan. Swear to be good until after dinner. Go out to  urlLink Botanical Garden .  Rationalize making pot of coffee when you come home so you can have more cobbler. Make pot of coffee. Ignore it. Eat rest of cobbler.

      Happy Fun Potato Wedges  Get you some good bakers.  Run them under water, remove the worst of the eyes and blemishes, run them under water again.  Cut them in half the long way. Now take those halves and cut them in thirds the long way. Put the potatoes "back together" and then wrap them in aluminum foil (they're still damp, right?). Put them in the oven for 3-4 hours at 325.  Take the potatoes out and unwrap them. Set the oven to 450. Break apart the potatoes and put them on a pan that has aluminum foil on it. Sprinkle cheese and bacon on top of the potato wedges. Place back in the oven for 10 minutes.  Serve the wedges with sour cream.

       salmon with dijon dill sauce (for losers)  or  you can take the girl out of the pacific northwest, but you can't expect her not to bitch and whine about eating vacuum packed frozen fish    for the sauce: 1 spoon sized glop of sour cream another glop of mayo a somewhat smaller glop of dijon mustard (i suppose yellow mustard could be substituted if you are more of a loser than i am) some dill some lemon juice some sea salt  mix this all around in a bowl.  cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit in the fridge for a while.  in the meantime, throw some salmon in the oven or on the george foreman grill or in a frying pan until your chances of food poisoning are outweighed by the threat of mercury poisoning.  top it off with the sauce, serve with some asparagus.  ta da.

      Jaybird's Happy Fun Atkins/South Beach Friendly Salad With Chicken Breasts  Prep: Chicken breasts, cut into halves or thirds. 1/4 bottle of well-shaken Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar dressing.  Throw the above into a gallon Ziploc bag for 20 minutes or so.  Meal: Marinaded chicken breasts. Tbs of olive oil Lawry's Seasoning Salt Frank's Red Hot  Add the olive oil and Frank's Red Hot to a frying pan and get it hot to the point where there are just barely wisps of smoke. Add the chicken. Sprinkle the Lawry's to taste. After 30 seconds or so, flip the chicken and sprinkle again. Then turn the oven down to about a "5" and cover. Flip occasionally over the next 10-15 minutes.  While the chicken is cooking, prepare the salad: Romaine Lettuce Grape or cherry tomatoes Pepperjack cheese cubes Girardi's Caesar Salad Dressing.  Mix the above in a ziploc bag (different one than the one you marinated the chicken in) and put in a wide dish. Put the chicken breasts on top of the salad.  Eat with a loved one and talk about when you used to eat bread.

       Shortcut Porkchops   My friends and relatives marinate their chops in a lot of fancy stuff, but I discovered that all you need is salt.  All you need are: Coarse Salt Pork chops A grill/broiler  Rub salt on each side of the porkchop. Grill for 15 minutes on each side or 'til golden brown. Just serve it with BBQ sauce on the side. Ta-da! Done.

      I'm pretty sure I have posted both of these before, but:   sesame noodles:  cooked spaghetti noodles (i like thin spaghetti) rinsed in cold water  in a gallon-size ziplock baggie, combine: 1/4 cup sesame oil 2-3 tbsp  urlLink Sriracha sauce  (chili sauce) 1-2 tbsp  urlLink fish sauce  1-2 tbsp sweet sauce (or 1 tbsp sugar) (You can find the sweet sauce with the other sauces & bottles of flavorings in most any vietnamese or asian grocery) 2-3 tbsp  urlLink rice wine vinegar  juice of 1/2 a lime 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger 2 tablespoons water (this is not an exact science--you make it to your tastes.  Key elements in asian cooking are balancing the sweet, the salty, & the spicy.)  put cold noodles in ziplock baggie with sauce, shake 'em around, soak for 2-3 hours, then let them get room-temp before serving. garnish with sesame seeds and chopped basil and cilantro.         coleslaw:  in gallon-size ziplock baggie, mix: 1/4 cup salad oil (vegetable, corn, whatever) 2 tbsp sesame oil 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 2-3 tbsp sweet sauce (or 1 tbsp sugar) 2 tbsp lime juice black pepper red pepper flakes --combine well.  add one finely-sliced head of regular cabbage, let sit in fridge for 1-2 hours, stir in chopped fresh basil and fresh shredded carrots just before serving.  garnish with sesame seeds.

       Krabby Patties   Defrost approx 1lb of synthetic crab. People, this is the midwest. This is all we get for 4.00/lb here. Mix together one egg, 1/2 cup of Contadina 2 cheese breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup of Progresso Italian breadcrumbs, some celery salt, tarragon, basil, and 1/4 cup of mayo (not miracle whip). Once that becomes pasty, toss in your stringy fake crab and mash with your hands. Once that Alaskan Pollock looks like a Jackson Pollock, squash it into 6 reasonably uniform patties. Fry 5 min on each side in some canola. Take a wild guess as to what sauce you're supposed to use and eat them with mayo. Yeah, like I really want to make my own aioli after trying to build a retarded powerpoint presentation all day.  Bonus: I also made a salad.  One bag of lettuce. I used 'Field Greens' One tomato - chopped One tub of feta cheese Some sliced red onion and some sliced black olives and a healthy dose of balsamic vinaigrette  All of this goes into a large freezer bag. Then you shake it. Shake it. Shake it like a __________________. Dump into Corningwear bowl.

      Prissy Pizza for Pennies  Ok, this one is actually sinfully easy :  1 - pizza crust dough (get one from your local pizzera, or Pillsbury refrigerated dough is good too! find it near the crescent rolls and tubes of cookie dough) 1 - container ricotta cheese 1 - head of garlic 1 - chicken breast (I buy the "tenders" which is the presliced breast meat 'cause I'm a lazy jerk) 1 cup - mozzarella cheese (did I spell that wrong? It looks weird to me) 1 cup - chopped asparagus or broccoli or any other pizza friendly veggie extra virgin olive oil  Chop garlic into small pieces. Sautee chicken in pan with olive oil and garlic - adjust for preference (I personally LOVE garlic and use a million cloves). When chicken is 3/4 cooked (still slightly pink) toss in chopped asparagus or broccoli to cook slightly and soften (and coat them with garlic goodness!!). Cook chicken thoroughly and dice into bite size pieces. I usually just jab at the chicken while it's cooking to break it up. 2 part benefit : already sliced and it cooks faster!  On a cookie sheet, lay out your pizza dough and brush lightly with olive oil. Top with more garlic if you really like bad breath. Then make a thin layer of ricotta cheese across the crust. If you're working with the Pillsbury dough, you'll get a rectangular dough, so you can fill it end-to-end. Once the ricotta is in place, top pizza with chicken and veggies of your choice. Lastly, add mozzarella on top.   Follow crust baking directions (usually around 10 minutes) and ta-da! You have pizza.  Thrifty Tips : * use left over chicken or veggies * you will need only a small amount of mozzarella on this one - you can even skip it if it's too expensive for you * cut your pizza "sicilian style" into small squares to make portions smaller and your food budget go further  This pizza is ridiculously easy and sorta fun to make, but for some reason people are always really impressed by it. I think it throws them for a loop that there aren't any pepperoni!

      I, Wifely, celebrated my birthday yesterday. It was heavenly.  I love my husband very much. He treated me like a queen! He gave me tons of presents, and didn't allow me to do any of the household chores. Ah, freedom! Though I did spend most of the day in bed (due to my stubborn cramps), it was wonderfully relaxing.   My wifely advice for today? Don't stop having fun. H gave me a mini-aquarium, several Mighty Beanz toys, Neil Gaiman's Coraline, DVDs galore, and a playset I've wanted for so long. I don't remember the title of the set, but it's got tons of little plastic monkeys and sticks. It's similar to the stack of Unos. You roll a die, take out a stick from a tree similar to the color that appears on the die, careful not to let any monkeys slip out. Oh it was so much fun!!!  We were laughing like little kids. We were maneuvering our sticks, giggling everytime monkeys would fall out of the tree and all. Ah, it was so much fun.  If you marry someone who can make you laugh from the belly, you picked the right one. :)

       Baking soda is my best friend!  => I put a container of it inside our fridge last night and it smells a lot better now. Or should I say, the lack of it smelling makes it smell better? You get the picture. Whatever! It takes the yucky odors out! => I sprinkled some BS (haha!) on a slightly damp sponge, wiped my kitchen counter with it, then rinsed my counter with water. Amazing! Okay, it looks clean. Maybe it's only psychological that it looks whit er  and clean er . =>I sprinkled some BS in our wastebaskets. Let's see if no funky smell comes out them when we go home tonight. =>There are a million other uses of baking soda. Thank you,  urlLink Arm and Hammer! . Click on the tour link, and you'll discover the many uses of BS for different parts of your house. I have yet to try using it for cleaning silverware, but I'll try it soon. And I'll let you know how it turns out!   Fluffy rice was a surprise hit!  =>My fluffy rice, thanks to  urlLink Ganns , was a hit with my family. Fluffy rice is 1 1/4 cup of water for every 1 cup of rice. =>My husband, however, prefers his rice a bit dry, so I think fluffy rice will be limited to family visits. Guess it's back to 1:1 at our place!

      It helps prevent dandruff, this  urlLink site  said. And so I tried it.  I was about to reach for my regular shampoo brand (let's call it Brand X, in the tradition of TV commercial lingo), when I remembered this tidbit I had learned during my net surfing yesterday. Hmmm. I reached for the bottle of Listerine and did my thing with a cap full of that mouthwash.  It was cool on the scalp. Of course, there wasn't any lather. It rinsed out quite quickly.   And so. My hair is scent-less today. My scalp is kinda itchy. I feel like I'm going to have dandruff instead of preventing my scalp from flaking. Argh! I'm having a bad hair day. My hair has a life of its own! No amount of Cream Silk Leave-on Conditioner can tame it.  I therefore conclude that Listerine is best for your mouth. And now I'm off to Propaganda to have my hair brought back to life.   On the side, did you know that Listerine was originally a foot bath? Maybe I should try that out.

      H (for Hubby) and I flipped through an album of our baby pictures, and we couldn't stop giggling and making fun of each other. As a baby, he was cute and cuddly. As a grown-up, he still is! And as for me, as a baby, I was... brown. As a grown-up, I'm... still brown. It's extremely fun comparing how we both evolved from such little chumps to big chumps.   Baby picture viewing is a wonderful bonding experience. You not only talk about each other's childhood, but you also imagine your own baby. Will baby get his eyes? My height? (I hope not.) His temper? My smile? And then both of you smile lovingly at each other, and poof! You go and try to create your own baby. (Just kidding! Really! We parked the album afterwards and watched the news.)  It's different when you look at baby pics when you're married versus when you're just going out. It's somehow more real now. It's more real in the sense that in a couple of months or so, both of you'll be carrying inside you a clone of that baby you saw in the old pics. Now,  that's  bonding.

      1 small tomato, chopped 1 small onion, chopped 3-4 cloves garlic, crushed 2 small cans of Purefoods Corned Beef  1 tbsp. olive oil (I use Canola oil)  Saute the garlic and onion bits in oil. Mix in the tomato bits. When slightly brown, mix in corned beef. Keep on flippin' and mixin' and fryin' till corned beef is a bit dry (just the way you like it). Yummy.   This is the 1st breakfast I've prepared so far that I didn't overcook. Though I did drop the chopping knife one time (almost piercing my mom-in-law's foot...it was an accident, I promise!), that was the only mishap in this corned beef experience. Whew.

      Imagine you're The Flash. Grab a slipper quickly. Do not bother if you should use the left or the right slipper. Aim. Throw it at the targeted roach with as much force as possible.    This is a guarantee you won't kill that roach:  Scream. Think whether you should use the right or the left slipper. Throw the slipper in random areas repeatedly (throw, pick up slipper, throw, pick up slipper, repeat as many times as you can) hoping to pin down that roach. Watch roach scurrying out of the room. Scream.   That roach better be out of the house tonight otherwise it's gonna get it!

I rarely had to lift a finger when I lived at my parents' place, hence my ignorance of housework, no matter how matter basic it is. So these things, no matter how primal even, are big things to me. And I'm mighty proud of myself.   Bring on the wifely duties!

      Part of being a good wife is staying healthy for yourself and for your husband (so you don't give him a headache when you have one.) Here's one way I try keeping healthy.  Breakfast is one Fuji apple and one cup of Nestle Hi-Calcium Zero Percent Fat Yogurt. Mmmmmmm. I like Fuji apples because they're more crunchy than the small red ones (whatever you call them) and more tasty. It's a great way to fill your tummy and lasts me all the way till lunch time. No mini snacks in between anymore. Wash it down with OJ or a big bottle of mineral water. Mmmmmm!

      H was sick last weekend, so I was stuck with dish-washing the whole of Sunday. Yeck. But I've discovered a way to lighten the load! Nope, it's not a new dishwashing detergent. Nope, it's not a magic sponge. It's singing. Ta-da!   I try remembering songs from my childhood. I see if I still memorize them. Then I sing to my heart's content, nevermind the jumbled lyrics and weird tunes. Before I knew it, I was done with the dishes!  So sing, sing, sing! It won't only make time fly faster, but you'll feel better afterwards too. No more "Huhuhu I'm so tired" feeling. It's more of a "Whew, I'm tired but that was fun" feeling.   So there. But please don't get any ideas to make me official dishwasher of any event okay? I'd still stay away from the chore if I could.

      Those who know me know that I'm very fond of personality tests. I'm about to give you one but I won't include the interpretations yet. I'll collect your answers first  and then  give you the interpretation in a couple of days.  Imagine you're about to sky-dive. You're in the plane, 20,000 feet up in the air! Your companions jump off the plane one by one. And now, it's YOUR turn! What thoughts are going on in your head as you prepare to jump off?   And so you jump off the plane! What do you do? Do you scream? If so, what do you scream?   Finally, you've landed safely on the ground. You're getting your parachute together when you see your instructor running towards you and shouting something. What is he saying?  Please leave your answers on the comment page.   P.S. The lesson for the day: Don't go through the day without sharing laughter with your partner. :)

      Open 2 packs of Knorr Cup-a-Soup. Pour both in one cup with hot water. Ta-da!  Thick and creamy soup. A very good way to fill up, especially if you're on a diet. Well, it's also twice the MSG so make sure to drink lots of water when you eat it.  (I recommend the Tom Yum flavored Cup-a-Soup... Mmmmm!)

      Being married is no excuse for you to not hang out with your single friends. But neither is it a reason for your single friends not to hang out with you anymore. Let me tell you a story.   I had a very enlightening evening with  urlLink valkyrie . She's a very close friend of mine from college. I truly enjoyed every second of our evening together -- from watching a basketball game to stuffing ourselves with chips to grabbing tea and cheescake to that heavenly choc-nut ice cream to the quiet walk back to my office to the sweet good night hug. It was a night full of girl talk and woman talk -- a combination of both.  I learned a lot that night. I've been wanting to hang out with my old friends for the longest time, but somehow I felt like they didn't want to anymore because I now tick M instead of S on that status box. It's been a long time since I've had a heart to heart talk with anyone other than my husband and my mother. And so that dinner with valkyrie was good for me.   Two lessons from wifely for this entry. One is this:  Keep good friendships alive.   Having a relationship with your husband is of course important, but trying to keep connections strong with some friends is just as important. I was able to pour my heart out to valkyrie in a way that's different from me pouring my heart out to H.  (That's a good thing, don't get me wrong.)  And a good friend listens to you and understands you the way no other person does.  Second lesson:  "I think real friendship is when there are no more expectations. I think it's when you just learn to really trust in your friends and not expect anything anymore."   After we had that insight, I then understood that  hey, if they don't wanna hang with me, then that's fine. I try, or will try, to understand why. I'm still okay with them and don't hold any grudge anymore.  That's one of the tests of true friendship I suppose. And I'm really happy that I consider what I have with valkyrie as true friendship.   So there. Hang out with your friends once in awhile. Hang out with your friends more often. It's good for your heart, it's good for your married life.    Thank you  urlLink valkyrie,  for being a true friend, and for helping me learn another life (wife?) lesson. :)

      After each time I use the toilet, I pour a capful of Zonrox (the lemon-scented one works for me) in the bowl to make sure it's super duper clean.  Little things make a big difference! That way, when it's bathroom-cleaning-time, it won't be as difficult to clean.  Ta-da!

      Back in my parents' house, we didn't usually run out of stock in the kitchen or in the bathroom cabinet. There was always enough toilet paper, toothpaste, milk, junk food, whatever. It's my Mom's philosophy to have at least two of everything at home, for everyone's convenience.  I've started applying that practice in my new home. Two of everything. Toilet paper seems to be the fastest thing that goes so every grocery trip means a purchase of Joy bathroom tissue. There was one time we ran out of Head & Shoulders for H, and he won't use any other brand but that. Thanks to "2 of Everything," we had a spare Head & Shoulders on our bathroom shelf. It saves a lot of headache and unnecessary whining.  Of course, when you're trying out a new brand, this practice shouldn't apply. And you have to keep track of what you have on stock. I lost track of my sardines stock, and now I have at least 6 cans of it in the cupboard. Eep! No sardine shopping in the next couple of months for us.

          When you need a boost, either with work or household chores, you can always trust energy drinks to help you out. They are our refrigerator staples as you can see!  These are the reasons why I can't excuse myself from housework. No "I'm too tired to wash the dishes" or "I'm feeling weak and can't lift the broom." Haha! But they're also great boosters when I can't find the energy to go shopping or when I need to go to work.

      Well, we do have a washing machine; it was a wedding gift but we haven't even opened the box yet (Woah... What if it was just a box for a washing machine but what's inside the box is just a bunch of junk? Or better yet, tons of money? We haven't checked that!). So anyway, how do I wash our undies?  I take a basin of water. Then I pour out maybe a handful of Tide Ultra with Nature Fresh scent (nothing else will do!) -- I don't measure it anymore, I just feel that about a handful is enough. Then I do that shaky-shaky bit with my hand (Whaddaya call that? Agitate the water?) till the water's all foamy. And then I pour half a cup of fabric conditioner into the water. Shaky-shaky again. Then I put in our undies (of course, I wash them with tap water prior to putting 'em into the soapy water). I soak them overnight.  When I wake up in the morning, the undies are ready for rinsing! So I rinse them till there's no more trace of soap and then hang them to dry.  I tried this process without fabric conditioner before and sheesh, our undies felt like they were starched!!! As in they could've stood on their own if you propped them up on the table or something. And when you wear them, they're not really comfortable, you know. Haha! So fabric conditioner is the way to go. And use Downy. I use the pink one. :)

      Babies sure have a way of melting your heart, don't they? Meet my very 1st niece!    urlLink Isabella   urlLink We'll hear the pitter patter of these soon!    Sigh. This woman wants to have a baby. I think the more you think about it though, the more it won't happen and so... I won't pressure H for a kid first.  I'll just keep praying and praying!

      So you may never have been into cars, tennis or basketball. But taking an interest in what HE likes is one way to keep the sparks alive in your marriage!  I was never into toys for little boys. I'm talking Masked Rider, Voltes V, X-Men and Marvel superheroes. I was a girly girl when I was a kid so my playthings either had long hair, pink ribbons or different pictures on their bellies (guess what characters I'm referring to!). H loves this little toy shop in QC. It's a Sunday tradition to go there and spend two hours going through crates of these little robots and Star Wars figurines. I used to look at the girly stationery and let him do the toy-hunting on his own; how was I to know what a cool robot was and what wasn't?   That changed when he asked me to hoard the crates with him. He wanted to share his love for robots and anime figurines with me. How could I resist a little boy's plea? So one Sunday I knelt down beside him and sifted through loads of little toys. It was pretty tiresome at first. A robot is a robot is a robot. Then I started finding little trinkets myself. Little Doraemon toys. What looked like anime collectible figurines (I don't know what they're called, they just looked cute). I started hunting for what H wanted to collect: Disney figurines. I found an inch-tall mini Princess Aurora plastic doll. What a find! I started to love toy hoarding and now I know who Masked Rider is.  Sundays aren't complete without trips to that toy store. And trips to that toy store aren't fun if we don't go together. We found another way to bond AND we found a way to bring out the kids in us. We're looking forward to Sundays at the toy store with a future baby H or baby Wifely. Haha!  As for my interests, well, H has discovered the beauty of foot spas (in fact, he invites me to have foot spas more often than I invite him!), the phenomenon that is Friendster (thanks to my love of online communication) and the benefit of exfoliating. :D

      I'm not kidding, we really have a First Aid cabinet, though we haven't mounted it on the wall yet. It's just settled on top of one of those boxes we have in our living room (which is filled with lots of other stuff that we have yet to fix... but that's another story.)  Our First Aid Cabinet is filled with all kinds of medicine - from the usual Ponstan, Advil and Biogesic tablets, to Diatabs, cotton balls, Betadine, band-aid strips, to lots more... even Chinese watermelon powder that's used to cure mouth sores or  singaw.  It's been very, very helpful because we've suffered the occasional knife cuts (mostly H's) while cooking, headaches, stomachaches... and the First Aid Cabinet's just a walk away from the kitchen.Super helpful. It's a great way to organize all the emergency medication.  When H cut himself, I rushed to the F.A.C. and immediately got cotton and betadine. After washing his cut with Safeguard, I went into nurse mode, cleaned his cut with Betadine and cotton then wrapped it with a band-aid. My knees were shaking because I hate blood, but a wife's gotta do what a wife's gotta do. That was one of the proudest moments I've ever had. Heehee.  So yes, do not underestimate the importance of a first aid cabinet!!!

       To make room for the right side of the page, I'm making an "archive" of sorts for my tips. :)   Just like them,  urlLink the book  is OUT! Thanks to this new bible, the Fab 5 will finally be a part of my living room. :)  "Scenery without solace is meaningless." -- The Five People You Meet in Heaven   "Our days are happier when we give people a bit of our heart rather than a piece of our mind." What good deed can you perform today? Spread the love!  Thinking of a fancy getaway but have no time to go out of town? Book yourself into a nearby hotel. Forget household chores. Forget work. Indulge in this quiet time and take things really slow. No need to rush for anything! Savor the breakfast buffet. Get a bubble bath. Eat that chocolate mint on your pillow. Relax in the cozy sheets. Sweet bliss!  Give the TV a break! Unplug the entertainment box and grab a book. You not only catch up on your reading, you have peace and quiet AND you're saving electricity!  They say if you do something straight for 21 days, it eventually develops into a habit. I tried doing that with one particular chore: sweeping our whole place before I leave for work. I have been doing it every other day and so I don't know if this theory works yet. Try the 21-day habit-building theory and let me know if it works!   Caring for your teeth means caring for your toothbrush too! Do try to soak your toothbrush's head in mouthwash for one minute. This will help get rid of those germs and give you a cleaner, healthier brushing experience.  Cheese Omelet in 3 easy steps: Beat 3 eggs. Pour into a frying pan. Add sliced cheese. Voila!  When you are given a compliment, resist the urge to say anything else except "Thank you."   It takes 8 minutes to make a hard-boiled egg. 4 minutes for a soft-boiled egg. 45 seconds for a quail egg. 2 minutes and something seconds for many quail eggs.  When buying raw meat from the grocery, make sure you have an ice chest in your car. This is where you store your raw meats, to avoid the build-up of bacteria on your food.  To make the cooking process flow more smoothly, prepare bowls, utensils and measured ingredients before cooking.   Peel away from you, never towards you, unless you have a death wish.  Use baking soda to put out fires. But if you have a lot of money, you can use salt instead.   Donâ€™t use ointment/oil-based treatments on burns; it will just make it hurt more! Do not use butter (bec. it's oil!) or toothpaste (bec. it has chemicals that may be harmful) for that burn either. Instead, use cream-based treatments. You can also put your burn under cold running water for 5 minutes.  Never try to catch a falling knife.  SM Makati is my best friend. Why? Their supermarket is well-organized and tres clean. In my book, they have the cheapest prices around too. What more could you ask for?  Watch  Shrek 2 !!!  If you want to truly pamper yourself, try The Spa on Jupiter Street -- it's their best branch. The facilities are incredibly well-maintained. The service is wonderful. It is by far the best spa I've ever been to. I'm definitely going back for more!  Routines aren't all that bad. Associate a day with a particular chore so there's no excuse not to do that chore, or say you forgot all about it. Tuesdays are laundry days for me. Hence, Laundry Tuesdays. I go to the laundromat every Tuesday and claim my laundry every Thursday. Routine helps. (I have yet to think of what chores to associate with the remaining days of the week..... hmmm....)  I love Palmolive Aromatherapy Essentials' Lavender Body Wash! It smells absolutely heavenly. I love soaping myself all over with it. I feel squeaky clean and very feminine when I step out of the shower!  I've never outgrown my love for Cerelac. This baby food makes a good afternoon snack! Mmm!  Use paper plates, plastic glasses, spoons and forks when not expecting company, or when your home is a mess. No worries of washing the dishes!  "Time does not change us. It just unfolds us." --Max Frisch  "Cheaper by the Dozen" -- the movie starring Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff and Tom Welling is a really light and funny movie. Watch it after a long day with family members in complete attendance!  Selecta's Choco Peanut Ice Cream on a Stick is incredibly yummmmy. :) It even has what seems like CHOCNUT bits in it!  Let's try to live out this beautiful quote: "I value the friend who for me finds time on his calendar, but I cherish the friend who for me does not consult his calendar." (Robert Brault)  Stop saying "I'll work when the clock strikes (a particular hour and minute)." JUST GET TO WORK!!! Otherwise, you'll end up procrastinating more. (This message is especially for me).  It's never too late to take the training wheels off your bike. (I will take them off soon I promise!!!)  Add a slice of cheese to your strawberry jam sandwich. Mmmmm. Sounds weird? Don't knock it till you've tried it!  Try new Twin Popsies Dalandan. It's too sweet for my taste, but it's okay. Maybe they're giving Nestle Lemonade's Ice Lolly a run for its money? Hmmmm. I still like the Nestle one better though.  1000 mg of Vitamin C everyday helps your resistance! Works for us!  I'm no coffee expert, but barako was the best coffee I've ever tasted. Mmmm. I tried a cup in Adriatico a couple of weeks back. Now this makes me want to visit Figaro... and Batangas!  Share interests. H doesn't like reading, but now he's actually reading books. Never mind if it's about wrestling or ghosts, at least he's beginning to discover the joy of books. :)  Prayer helps.  Don't scrimp on photographs. When your memory goes, they are all you'll have left of yesterday.  Sunsilk Nutricare Pink + Pantene Conditioner = Soft, smooth hair :D  Jollibee's Sausage Sandwich is scrumptious. It's a complete breakfast -- thick bread, sunny side up, and a large sausage patty. I love it!  Fried chicken is a party staple. We didn't serve any last night, and my sister was looking for chicken. Oh well, maybe next party!  Blue is a bad color for a kitchen. Experts say the color weakens one's appetite. So if you're on a diet, maybe you should try installing a blue light bulb in your kitchen.  Playing "Twister" (especially if it's with a wacky 8-year-old) is a great way to exercise.  I like the Jollibee LOTR tumbler. It doesn't have a hole for the straw, so I can use it as my own water tumbler. I can leave it (with the lid on) in the ref. So whenever I need a quick sip of H20, I just grab my tumbler. No more getting a glass and pouring from pitchers.  Create a humor file. Get a box and will it with quotes, anecdotes, pictures, jokes, stories that make you laugh. Draw a card out every once in a while when you wanna crack up or just feel better. :) Interesting huh!  For the new year, wear something you've never worn before. I got really pretty dangling earrings from my aunt. I never thought I'd wear earrings 2 1/2 inches long. I wore them today and hey, they grew on me. I love 'em! I'll start wearing more of them next year! So you try something new too! :)  Try to make sure your checkbook's always balanced!  Ube from Baguio topped with Nestle Cream is heavenly. You'll be oooohing with each spoonful. Careful though, 'cause if you eat too much, you might cry your way to the bathroom.  Play Christmas music while wrapping gifts. It'll put you in a cheerier mood and wrapping time will fly by quickly!  Learn something new for this year's X'mas celebration. Try baking bread or mixing up some alcohol-free punch for everyone!  Pray together.  Be more active in taking care of yourself, woman. Get a pap smear at least once a year &amp; have your breasts checked by your OB-gyn.  When going on a trip, choose sachets over bottles as much as possible. They're space savers, anti-spill, anti-mess and you can throw 'em away after using them!  Don't forget to pamper yourself! Getting a manicure, a pedicure and a foot spa can do wonders for your relaxation. Mmmm!  Drinking hot green tea everyday reduces the risk of heart disease. And it helps a lot with digestion, too. :)  When you go on a diet, it helps to have a diet buddy. The motivation is higher because of the support you give to and get from each other!  A childhood favorite: Put condensed milk on boiled corn on the cob. Bite into the corny sweetness. Yum. Repeat process - pour condensed milk on the corn. Ooooh sweet heaven.  To avoid getting mugged, don't bring a wallet when you go to Divisoria. Put money in your pockets, hidden pockets in your bag, in your hankies, even your shoes.  Rub salt on fingers to get rid of fishy, oniony, garlicky and other stinky smells.  Eucalyptus is the best candle scent for bathrooms. It soothes AND awakens your senses at the same time. It's a really refreshing scent. Light a euca-scented candle when you're using the toilet (you know!) and while bathing. Just make sure to put out the candle before leaving the bathroom. Never leave a burning candle unattended!  After a spat, take a cool bath! (Alone, together -- that's up to you!) The cold water will literally cool you down, so you go back to your sweetie in a calmer mood.  Clean your aircon's filter often. The less you do it, the more dirt accumulates, the harder it will be for your a/c to function, the higher your electric bill will be. (Must I tell you about the air you'll be breathing too?) So clean, clean, clean it!  The little things count: Like preparing your wife's toothbrush while she dresses up for work, or laying out his pajamas on the bed as he prepares for bedtime.  2 Kimy Bulilitz (Milk Ice Cream Bars -tastes like Nido!) is equal to one glass of milk. Mmmm!  Use T-shirts as pillowcases!  Leave your shoes outside your bedroom, that way, you don't bring in yucky yucky elements into the bedroom. We're putting a shoe rack right outside my bedroom door so I can "park" my shoes before entering the most sacredplace at home.:)  "Life is HOW we are, not who we are or what we have." This simple statement has significantly changed my outlook on life the past couple of days.  Have a bottle of water on your bedside table as much as possible as a thirst quencher, or using it to wash out something from your eye. A REAL emergency.  "Isang patak kaya ang 'sang katutak" says Joy Dishwashing Liquid. Well... hindi rin eh.  Don't leave peppermint scented sachets in your closet for too long. They're bound to emit some kind of odor that will make you want to barf.  Go out on a date with your husband. Never stop the courtship. :)  Place the alarm clock far away from you to avoid repeated (and failed) pressing of the snooze button. It's a sure way to wake you up!  Bring a cookbook along with you when you go shopping. If a meal does pop up in your head, you can double-check the ingredients right away.  Find time to be on your own even if you're both in the house. My alone time lasts for around 30 minutes -- waking up ahead of him, heating my bath water, reading a book, taking a shower. Spending time with yourself is a great way to focus on your personal needs. Tune in to what your body's telling you. Tune out all the work and home stress. Then after that, cuddle back with the hubby.  Using a different pair of slippers for the bathroom and for the rest of the house is the best way to kiss watery slipper prints goodbye!  Never leave your trash IN the trash can for more than 3 nights, unless you want the smell of wet garbage to welcome you home after a hard day's work  Heating a hard-boiled egg in the microwave sets the pace for making egg salad. Heat. Jump from seat when you hear KABOOM! Tada -- mashed eggs galore. Never do this more than once in your lifetime.  3 tablespoons of Tang Pomelo in one regular-sized glass is enough to give you a big sugar headache.

      You know those little baon-sized cans of fruit cocktail you can buy at the grocery?   I keep around 3-4 of them in the ref all the time. They're perfect emergency desserts. We had no dessert one night and we were craving for dolce (as my grandfather calls it), so I got two bowls and emptied a can in each of the bowls. Since it was ice cold, it was sooo good. Slightly frozen sweet delights.   We had La Cremeria Strawberry Fields Ice Cream once, and topped it off with the fruity treats. That was also a delicious way to end dinner.  They're pretty cheap. You can get the regular Fruit Cocktail mix, or get one's that purely Peaches. That's also divine. :)

      I'm terribly, terribly sick. I missed out on a wonderful dinner with friends and that doesn't make me feel any better at all! *boohoo* I don't know where I caught this flu bug, but I sure wanna squish it so badly. Problem is, I don't have the energy to do that.  Ooh my wifely tip. Do go home. By home I mean your parents' place. That's where I'm recuperating now. I feel much more comfortable here so my folks don't mind that I nurture myself to health here. H is also with me. We both acknowledge that when you're sick, you gotta go all out with the comforts of familiarity so you can get better faster.

      Do not underestimate the power of media when it comes to inspiring/helping you out with domestic stuff!  There's this show called Hidden Hills. My friend Karen told me about it. She said it was amusing and really relevant to us married couples. I caught parts of it last night and hey! It's pretty cool! I think I'll be watching that more often.   There's also a comic strip called  For Better or For Worse.  Go to comics.com and look for the strip. It has funny insights about married life and family life.

      And now the ultimate picker-upper. Here's a poem called "Phenomenal Woman" by Maya Angelou. Hope it inspires you just as it inspired me.   ~*~   Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.  I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size  But when I start to tell them,  they think I'm telling lies.   I say, It's in the reach of my arms,  The span of my hips,  The stride of my step,  The curl of my lips.  I'm a woman  Phenomenally.  Phenomenal woman,  That's me.   I walk into a room  Just as cool as you please,  And to a man,  The fellows stand or  Fall down on their knees.  Then they swarm around me,  A hive of honey bees.   I say, It's the fire in my eyes,  And the flash of my teeth,  The swing of my waist,  And the joy in my feet.  I'm a woman  Phenomenally.  Phenomenal woman,  That's me.   Men themselves have wondered  What they see in me.  They try so much  But they can't touch  My inner mystery.  When I try to show them,  They say they still can't see.   I say, It's in the arch of my back,  The sun of my smile,  The ride of my breasts,  The grace of my style.  I'm a woman  Phenomenally.  Phenomenal woman,  That's me.   Now you understand  Just why my head's not bowed.  I don't shout or jump about  Or have to talk real loud.  When you see me passing,  It ought to make you proud.   I say, It's in the click of my heels,  The bend of my hair,  the palm of my hand,  The need for my care.  'Cause I'm a woman  Phenomenally.  Phenomenal woman,  That's me.

      When H and I went on an out-of-town trip this weekend, I made sure I had a hairdryer. I was sure the cold Baguio air would leave my hair either too flat or too up and about (think static galore!). That's why before the trip, I went to this appliance store (I forgot the name... it starts with the letter A). I bought a P315 3D hairdryer. It wasn't that bad at all! Even if it were so cheap, it served its purpose. It was also very compact, the type that folds in two, so I saved a lot of space in my bag.   Most importantly, I had great hair. Heehee.

      Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium-sized saucepan. Peel an apple, cut into quarters, cut into quarters some more and then place in saucepan. Sprinkle sugar over it and stir. Pour 1/4 cup water, stir, cover pan tightly and let sit for 10 minutes, Cool, then mash with fork to desired consistency.   I tried this last night and it was a hit with my 8yo cousin. She loved it so much she asked me to prepare some for Christmas dinner. I asked her if she'd help me and she eagerly said yes! She finished most of it too. Haha! I'll make some more again soon - a whole bottle of it, just for her!

      Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium-sized saucepan. Crumble toasted bread into it. Sprinkle a generous amount of sugar (I used 1 tablespoon). Stir. Add milk (just enough to soak the bread a wee bit). Cover with lid tightly and let sit for 5 minutes over low heat. Cool, then mash with fork to desired consistency. Serve with jelly on top!  Yummmmmmmmmy. That was today's merienda. I got it from a book called "The Art of Expecting." It said that this was a great replacement to sweet cookies 'cause it's much healthier. It's also great comfort food for kids. Well, it sure comforted me!

      I almost lost hope in several areas in my life the past couple of weeks. I'd wallow in self-pity, cry a bit, and keep on wondering what would become of my life. During the lowest moments, I cried and prayed to Him. "What is your plan? Why am I going through this?" I felt terrible that I felt terrible. I had so many blessings, but I was ultra-myopic at those times. All I could see were my frustrations -- the other things that made me happy I had set aside. When I calmed down, I closed my eyes and listened. And He whispered in my heart two things:  On Frustration #1: "Have faith." On Frustration #2: "Just do your best and it will come to you." (Sorta like "If you build it, they will come." Very  Field of Dreams! )  I felt a lot better after that. I said sorry to Him for my selfishness, then thanked Him for His patience with me, and for all the blessings he has showered upon me.  It's amazing what prayer can do.

      Magnolia is selling this new product: hotdog-flavored cheese. They're packed in a sausage-like shape (well, think of it as one giant chorizo), with the word "PROCESSED" even bigger than the Magnolia branding of the product.  #1, I don't I think I'll ever buy this because of how processed this food (?) is. Hotdogs are already scraps of leftover meat that are stuffed and shaped into one long log and sold to kids. And now they're putting it in cheese?!  #2, I'm glad the producers are truthful by placing "PROCESSED" on the wrapper-- in fact, it's the first word I saw once I got attracted to the chorizo-shaped packaging. But it's also the first thing that makes me cringe and put the product back on the shelf and head on my way to the yogurt section.  Okay, I'll admit I do eat hotdogs. In fact, I love cheesedogs. But this hotdog-flavored cheese just grossed me out. *shivers* To each his own!

       I have to admit that I'm not always price-conscious about things, but I am budget-conscious. Ha! There's a difference between those two, and you know it. I'm not the type of person who'd compare one product's price with another, and choose the cheaper one. I've always chosen a product based on its quality. For example, I can never imagine myself using Surf, so I'm a Tide person. I can't bring myself to use Lifebuoy, I'm a Safeguard and Dove person. Tried and tested always works better for me, but I'll give new ones a chance. If I find something though that's cheap AND has wonderful quality, that brand definitely has my loyalty. I found a great place that I think will have that loyalty.   Divisoria was a blast. My friends and I went there this weekend, and I only spent P2,700 (approximately US$50). I bought bags and bags of goodies! I was able to buy a thermos for only P60. The original price was P80 (which is already really cheap), but going to Divisoria means haggling is a given. The thermos is of really good quality, and it probably costs around P250 in malls. I bought 5 of them on the spot. Those will make perfect Christmas presents to my coffee-loving friends and those who travel, too. I bought H a really cool Hulk t-shirt for only P120 and a Hulk sando for only P100. Those cost probably more than 500 and 250 (respectively) in outside boutiques. Oh I bought a lot more than those, including wonderful shirts for yours truly. My BEST buy was a pair of jeans that fit sooooo well -- it hugged my butt and legs perfectly, without the discomfort of having to worry about VSP (visible panty lines) or that they look too much like leggings already. All I have to do is have them altered because they're too long (all pants are always too long for me since I'm only 5 feet tall). The jeans cost only P350.  I will now frequent Divisoria more often. Getting there is terrible; it's far from where I live so think traffic jams galore, there's not that much parking space (so it's best if you have a driver), and the entrance to Divi Mall stinks. Plus, there are lots of pedicabs going around the place who don't give a damn whether they run over your feet or not. There was one pedicab speeding towards MY SIDE OF THE ROAD. I think he was expecting that I'd move to the edge of the road (which was filled with stinky garbage.) I didn't budge. I just kept on walking, ignoring the pedicab speeding towards me. When it was about six inches in front of me, it swerved to the right, its rightful place on the road. See? He was just psyching me out. When he saw that I didn't budge, he just went his usual route. Sheesh. I think that driver was tripping on me because he thought I was just a city girl. Well, THIS city girl won't take crap from anyone. My friends, who were walking behind me, shouted "OH MY GOD!" right before that stupid driver swerved back to his side of the road. You know what the driver did? He mimicked my friend and went, "Oh my god!" That's when I knew he really was tripping on us. HA! If they think they can push us around just because we're from the city, he thought wrong. Had he ran over my foot, I would've chased him down the street and probably threw stones at him. Anyway, I shared this with you because you really have to be super alert and streetsmart when you go there.   Despite that almost-squashed-by-a-pedicab experience, I'm still eager to go back to Divisoria Mall. I have lots more goodies to buy and lots more haggling to practice. :)   In other news, I got my period this week. So there is no baby girl yet. We'll try again!

      There's a new Sunsilk in the grocery. It looked cool so I bought it. It's called "Sunsilk NutriCare with Olea Nutrium." I chose that because it's the one that makes your hair extra soft and silky. (That's what it said on the bottle anyway). I tried it and I loved it! I used to shampoo and conditioner with Pantene, but I think my hair was getting tired of that brand.  Good thing for this new Sunsilk. It's really great. After one usage, my hair already felt softer, and for lack of a better term, was "flatter." I have wavy short hair so you can imagine the mess I wake up to. (I look like Astroboy or Einstein) -- but that's not my point! My point is I always have to blowdry my hair because it's always a mess. NOW, I don't have to blowdry because my hair's "flatter." But since I go to work everyday and have meetings almost everyday, I have to blowdry it, and now my hair looks fabulous.  Of course, that's all just me. It's a lot better than my hair before. Yehey Sunsilk NutriCare!  Even my husband likes it -- not on me, on him! He uses it too!  Check it out. It's the one in the pink bottle!

      I read somewhere (The  urlLink Baby Names  website, I think) that if you're aiming for a baby girl (Ha! No pun intended...), you gotta make whoopee 2 to 4 days before ovulation. Also, when making whoopee, there are certain positions that you gotta get into if you want to have a baby girl or boy -- since the little Ys are sprinters, you and the husband have to be as close as possible. You know what I mean. And since Xs are marathon runners (kinda slow but have more stamina and endurance than the Ys), you do the opposite thing (Don't get too close!).   I have other theories which I've read about, but I don't know if they're true. Urhm. Let me validate them first.

      My fingers are freezing as I type this. There aren't that many people here in the office and so it's colder than usual. Maybe I should buy gloves and wear them everytime I'm here at work. Oooh, then I can buy some kind of hand-moisturizing lotion so my hands stay soft even while I'm working. Good idea.

       I shiver at the sight of blood...  H and I are planning to get a blood/RH compatibility test when he arrives home from Bangkok. We just want to make sure our blood types are a-ok with each other before we get really serious on that babymaking thang. I'm kinda nervous. I've been reading up on this and if the results aren't good, the doctors (on the net anyway) say I'd have to be treated (ala injected) with some kinda hormone thing. Oi oi oi oi oi oi. Wish us luck!   In other news...  Christmas Eve was a blast.  Wifely tip...  the charm of "real" photographs, meaning, those we have hard copies of, is still different from the ones taken with a digicam. There's a warmer, fuzzier feeling when you're holding the photographs in one hand and passing the pictures from one pair of hands to another... unlike the computerized ones where you have to use the mouse. And you can't ship your computer everywhere you go. It's great for keeping in touch, so relatives abroad can still be a part of the celebration. But for keepsakes, hard copies are still the best. That's why H always carries our digicam, and I carry my trusty KB10. :D

      This is a tip from my cousin-in-law, Ate Jenny! She and her hubby, my Kuya Bee-Boy, are expecting a baby next year. They're trying to squeeze in some personal time together now, way before the baby arrives. :) She has a point! Once the baby comes, there might not be enough time to go on those romantic dates anymore. It'll all be about the baby! So now, they try to watch at least 3 movies a week.   I think that's a great idea. January's coming along, the future-grannies (my Mom and H's mom) are asking me almost everyday about their future grandchild, my biological clock's going berserk, and H always grabs the chance to spend time with our 8-yo-cousin, Max. I think we're gonna have a baby first quarter next year (cross those fingers!) so we might as well get into movie marathon mode already. :D Ooooh. And well, it's the Metro Manila Film Festival soon... maybe we can start with that!  P.S. Another thing I was thinking of was Discovery Suites' Wellness Package. It's a weekend for two at their hotel, with body scrubs, meals and massages in the package. I'll check it out sometime... looks like a very relaxing and very interesting holiday gift for both of us busy bumblebees.

      I was on sick leave yesterday. I played The Sims for 8 straight hours!!! My butt hurt so much. I didn't eat, go to the bathroom or take a nap. I ignored my aching tummy. After that equivalent-to-a-working-day-Sims-moment, I took a long shower then started wrapping the rest of our Christmas gifts. This time, my back hurt. Argh. I had an aching back and an aching butt. Then H comes home from work, with a backache too. I gave him a massage to feel tons better. As for me, my back and butt still hurt. Maybe I should start running around the office. :D  I love listening to 88.3 (FM). Different versions of "A Grown-Up Christmas List" were played last night -- Natalie Cole, Kelly Clarkson, Amy Grant, etc. I don't remember if they had Michael Buble (Love his X'mas CD!).  That was my gift-wrapping music.    Wifely tip: Do NOT buy those cheap Scotch tape rolls in Greenhills.   I know they're really inexpensive, but well, you do get what you pay for. Halfway through my wrapping, some of the tapes were coming off! Grrrrrrrr. I had to double-tape them.  Next time, I'm buying 3M.

       1. Did you believe in Santa when you were young?  Oh yes. Didn't all kids? I remember waking up to a strawberry writing pad when I was younger.  And coming home to a Teddy Bear backpack after a Christmas Eve dinner. I even wrote him a week before Christmas, I think. I'd leave them on top of the piano or inside a stocking. I miss those innocent days.  2. Did you hang christmas stockings on christmas eve?  Not all the time. Santa usually left his presents by my bed or on top of the piano. My gifts were usually too big to be placed inside a stocking. :D  3. So far, what was the most memorable gift you received on Christmas and from whom?  Memorable, but not in a good way. Haha! My parents gave me a pencil sharpener when I was 13. It was an electric sharpener and I was flabbergasted when I opened it. What the heck would I do with that? Sharpen pencils, yes, but I could do that in school. It was so impersonal. I wanted to cry when I unwrapped it.  4. When and how did you learn the real truth about santa?  Third grade! I still remember my classmate (Kukay, she was called) talking about how she didn't believe in Santa because she knew her parents were posing as Santa. I was so disillusioned. I didn't want to believe her, but she was so insistent. I wanted to cry.  5. Did you have holiday traditions in your home when you were growing up?  See #3 of my previous blog entry. :)  6. Did you mail your holiday cards already?  No. Dang it.

       1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?  When I feel the crisp air on my skin and a slight breeze blow through my hair, I know it's Christmas time. Having a humid, scorching, sweaty Christmas just isn't right.   2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?  Christmas Eve. At my grandparens' home in Project 6. With my husband, my immediate family, my cousins, aunts and uncles, niece, etc. It would be great if our cousins and aunts and uncles in the States could also come home for the holidays.   3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?  Christmas Eve at my grandparens' home in Project 6.  Tons of picture-taking by the Christmas tree -- with the whole clan! Fruit salad care of my sister. Raffle care of me. Opening of the gifts at 12. Reading out the gifts care of me.  Handing out the gifts care of my cousin Maxine. Overflowing chestnuts. Overflowing love and laughter. Wrappers crumpled all over the floor. My grandmother picking up the scraps so she can recycle the wrappers. Ah, I love Christmas traditions.   4. Do you do anything to help the needy?  This year, I became a fairy godmother to two less-fortunate children. Last year, and we're planning it this year as well, we're giving out chocolates and cookies to streetkids.   5. What one gift would you like for yourself?  For myself? An all-expenses paid trip to Boracay. H and I will stay in one of the best resorts there, we get massages everyday and swim in the beach every morning and night, we party everyday and have our quiet moments too. Hey, that doesn't sound bad. Maybe we should do that for Valentine's.

      I tried drinking one tablet. I wanted to see whether it really was going to make me more energetic. It was quite effective. I took it in the morning, then I was still wide awake and alert at around 5pm. That is a feat for me. I tend to become sluggish around 3-5 pm; my body starts craving for siesta around that time. So anyway, I was able to work more. I think that energy was sustained till around 8pm. Then I became my usual sleepy self at 9-10. I should take Rogin-E more often.

      Random thoughts...   I like Michael Buble's Christmas album. There are only 5 songs in it, though, phooey. H and I played it last night when we got home, and we sang along to it. It made for a cheerier night than usual.   I can't wait to start wrapping presents. We already started last weekend but we're not even halfway done! And we haven't even completed our Christmas list yet! Yikes! I love the pressure though. This is the only pressure I like -- Christmas shopping. H noted that we've bought a LOT of presents this year, far more than we did the year before. I think it's because I feel the spirit of giving more. TRUE! I was so giddy wrapping my sisters' presents; I was giggling and beaming because I knew they would LOVE our presents. Is that the Christmas spirit? :) I think it is.   I also think I'll be preparing something edible for our family Christmas party. Usually, I just help arrange the family games. This year, I wanna do that AND prepare a little something. So far, it's a cross between potato latkes with applesauce and choco mud pies... hmmm...    Another reason why I feel so good this Christmas is that I've been helping some charities in little ways. I've "sponsored" two needy children and am in charge of granting their Christmas wishes. They both wished for toys and books, and a new school bag, so that's what they're getting from me. And maybe even more. I'm really looking forward to this weekend for that. I'll go to the mall and see how I can grant their wishes.   H and I are reading "The Purpose-Driven Life," and we try to read one chapter a day, and reflect on that day's readings. We do that before we turn the lights out. It's a great way to bond before going to sleep. :)    I feel the Christmas spirit! And its biggest evidence is the pile of paperwork right here on my office desk that I am blatantly ignoring. I just have a silly grin in my face and have visions of sugarplums dancing in my head.

      Funny. My friend chooses her drinking glasses at home based on this: how her hand fits into it. So she can clean it easily, she says. She's right! I have a hard time cleaning my drinking glasses at home. I have to "fold" my hands in a weird way so it gets into the glasses thoroughly. The next time I buy drinking glasses for us, that'll be the most basic thing to look for. It should be cleaning-hand-friendly!

      I got a breast ultrasound last weekend. I've been feeling some breast pain the past weeks and was really worried. So, I went to the doctor last Saturday. After two hours, my test came out as negative. What a relief. The doctor just asked me to keep monitoring the pain, that is, if it does come back again. I think it's just stress. But I'm glad I went for that check-up. At least I know there's no lumpy thing anywhere near my breasts. I should get an ultrasound once a year. Funny thing is, I've had it twice this year. Paranoid? Nah, just really health-conscious.     P.S. Some readers think I'm a middle-aged housewife. Heehee. Can't blame them -- this blog is all about household stuff. Haha! To clarify, I'm a 26-year-old full-time careerwoman, working in the fast-paced advertising industry, who manages to squeeze in some time to sweep the floors and dust the furniture. ;)

There are some things I'd like to do for him, like cook him dinner and fix up the house for him... but it's never just for him alone, it's ultimately for both of us.

Since I'm such a photo buff (a very eager amateur to be exact), I am sure I'll enjoy this. Next time I will get the Holga model. Maybe on my birthday. :D

      I brought work home last night, but as fate would have it, I ended up not working. H's laptop couldn't read my diskette. I almost moped because I had my heart set on finishing my report last night, but then I thought moping wouldn't do anything. It was a blessing in disguise. As I calmed down, H turned off his laptop and started sharing stories with me. We both have been so busy we haven't had the change to just sit and talk about anything beyond the everyday topics (work, officemates, movies, family, etc.). But last night, as we settled in the dining room,  I held his hand and he just talked and talked. I listened, and when I talked, he listened.   It made me realize how much quality time mattered. I knew by theory that a couple should always talk, and we do talk, but last night was pretty different. We talked about faith, our beliefs, our fears of the future, our hopes. And though in our hearts we already knew we were doing this, we pledged our support for each other in whatever endeavor each of us takes. It brought us even closer and made us understand each other a bit more.  I'm also thankful we have our own place to live -- there's nothing like settling after a long day's work in a place you can call your own. No in-laws running around, no parental units to be aware of, no siblings to grab the remote control. We talked for a long time, just the two of us, in our dining room. And though we continously talked, it was a quiet, peaceful time for both of us. And to think we wouldn't have had that kind of conversation had I worked on my report all evening.

      That's the 4th commandment right? Anyway, I honored my Dad last night in a wild, happy way: we gave him a surprise party! 'Twas my idea, and it was perfect because everyone close to our family was present (even my in-laws and my sister's boyfriend's father!). As soon as he stepped into the dark house, we turned the lights on, yelled "Happy Birthday!!!", and my sister's band played the Happy Birthday song.  The look on his face was unforgettable. He was mucho touched and he kept smiling and beaming all night.  I've never given anyone a surprise birthday party before... well not one wherein I was the main party organizer. I was really happy because he looked like he had so much fun - he even sang with the band. Several of the guests went up to the band and sang along too. 'Twas hilarious. And sometimes Daddy would sit down in one corner, bop his head to the music and just keep on smiling. He really didn't expect this party.   My wifely step is this...  do something special for your parents even if you're already part of a couple-unit.  I've been so focused on managing my own household now that I usually just visit the folks, hang with them, that's it. I wanted to show my Dad how much people cared for him, hence a surprise birthday party. I'm proud to say that everyone we invited showed up. Hooray! He told my cousin it was his best birthday ever. It makes me happy that he's happy. (And though he doesn't read this blog, I'll shout it out anyway,   I love you Daddy! Happy birthday!  )

      There's something soothing about scrapbooks. Well, the soothing feeling not only comes from reading, but more from making it -- getting the scrapbook together. I learned a scrapbook technique from B, a good friend. She said it truly relaxed her and gave her peace. I wanted to try it myself, too. Here's the technique she shared with me:  1. Get old magazines.  2. Cut out  anything that interests you.  It could be an article, a picture, a quote, a word, ANYTHING. If you like dogs, cut them out. If you like flowers, cut them out. If you like mushy quotes, cut them out! Just keep on cutting!  3. Cut in waves, curls, whatever. The fun thing is you don't have to worry about cutting in straight lines (unless you're really obsessive compulsive!). Flip through the pages, read a bit, then cut some more!  4. After cutting each piece out, I place it in a box so they won't fly away or get lost among the magazines.  5. When I've had my fill of cutting, I take out all the pieces from the box and lay them on the table.  6. I get my scrapbook (I got mine from National Bookstore) and my glue. I randomly grab cutouts and glue them onto the scrapbook. If you want to put things together, like if you want to create themes, go ahead. My style is to just grab a cutout and paste, grab a cutout and paste.  7. Feel the relaxation and that smile pasted on your face. It feels goooooood!  It doesn't matter if it looks like there's no synergy among the pictures or words. You'll probably end up pasting a picture of a pitcher next to a quote about marriage (like I did!). It doesn't matter! Remember: you cut these pieces out because they're things you're interested in! They're things that probably make you laugh, smile, blush, dream, sleep peacefully, sigh romantically, etcetera etcetera etcetera.   It would be a fun read, especially if you're in a nostalgic mood, want to be perked up or you're just plain bored. The scrapbook will transport you to a place where only you dance in that cutout meadow, where only you can meditate in that cutout seashore, where only you can imagine what's going on between you and the cute pic of a guy you cut out, where only you can feel the sensuality and comfort of Indian silk pillows. It's a scrapbook filled with your desires. All the words, all the pictures there are YOURS.   I'm glad I took on this little hobby. It relaxes me after a long day of work. It really soothes my nerves and somehow revives me. Here, some samples of what I've done so far. Click on each for its slightly bigger version.       urlLink      urlLink      urlLink         I always thought that scrapbooks were a great way to keep trinkets and reminders of the past, but now I understand that scrapbooks are an even better way to keep dreams and pictures of things that give you happiness and inner peace.

      Pond's has this new unique item - aromatherapy oils trapped in little gel capsules. There are 4 oils with a distinct purpose: to energize (green), relax (lavender), romance (red),  be happy (pink). You twist the capsule open, and dab the oil onto your pulse points -- temples, wrist, sides of the throat. I had a headache last Saturday (because I played H's Gameboy Advance in the car -- bad girl!), and so I thought it would be perfect to try this new Pond's beauty item out.   I tried the lavender one. Mmmmmm. I love that scent. There was a lot of oil in that tiny capsule. The scent isn't overpowering, but it is enough to give you a momentary sense of relaxation. I dabbed the excess oil onto my hanky and just inhaled it every once in awhile. Did it relax me? A bit. It helped. But what really relaxed me was the shuteye I got afterwards. :)   Trivia: Did you know that there are  16  pulse points in our bodies? There are points on the ankles, behind the knees, on either side of the pubic bone, inside the elbows, either side of the throat, at the wrist and the temples, as well as one point at the breastbone, and another point between both of the breasts. Thanks to  urlLink this site  for that information! I'd say this is very useful info!

Come what may, I just pray that we will have an exciting AND peaceful new year!  (And I wish the same for you guys too!)

      I've always been a collector. I've collected stationery and stickers during my gradeschool days. I've tried collecting some books like Sweet Valley Twins and Sweet Valley High (eep!) during my teenybopper days, and later on, Dragonlance. Right now, I like collecting notebooks and scrapbooks.  The country girl in me wants to start collecting pitchers. I saw a feature in O (one of my favorite magazines) about pitchers, and my heart just screamed "Whoopee! Pitchers!" They come in all shapes and sizes. It would be fun to display them in one cupboard. And they're practical! Or I can use them as a flower vase, a goldfish bowl,  maybe even a candle holder, for smaller pitchers. How interesting! Maybe I will start collecting pitchers. I saw a couple of interesting ones being sold at a discount last Christmas. Dang, I missed out on those. No wonder I felt some kind of affinity towards them then. Maybe I was meant to be a pitcher collector. Teehee.

      I don't have a jewelry box because I don't own that much jewelry. Most of my accessories are very casual, like beads, so I just hang them from little wooden knobs on the wall. But I love earrings, and I've been looking for a good place to keep my growing collection. I've bought a plastic tray for it, but it didn't come out very organized. This morning, I discovered a new home for my earrings by accident.  You know those little pill box that have dividers? Some even have "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday..." labeled on each little box. I have a plain blue plastic pill box with eight  slots that I discovered in my closet this morning. I was holding one pair of earrings in one hand, wondering where to place them this time, when I saw that blue pill box.   A lightbulb flashed in my head! Why not put one pair of earrings per slot in the pillbox? I dropped the pair of earrings in one slot and ta-da! Perfect! I think I'll buy the bigger, longer versions of those pillboxes and place my earrings there. A great way to organize earrings! Maybe even rings too!

      Happy New Year! H and I celebrated New Year's Eve in our own apartment. We wanted to start a tradition. Since that was our first New Year's celebration as husband and wife, we decided to celebrate it alone. We shopped for our Media Noche in the afternoon, watched a DVD of "Lord of the Rings: Two Towers" in the early evening. When it was around 10pm, we started cooking our midnight feast. It was a very simple midnight dinner - we had pasta (our first attempt at making spaghetti --  wifely tip:  when the sauce gets too thin, add tomato catsup), corned beef (our favorite), garlic bread (I burnt the toast, as usual!), chestnuts, grapes, queso de bola, and Coca-Cola. At 11:30pm, we lit our Prosperity Candles given by my mom-in-law. Prosperity candles are a great idea for a Christmas present next year! They come in a set of 7; each candle has a different color and has a specific meaning. For example, a pink candle means love, green=money, red=health, orange=career, purple=spiritual growth, blue=peace, yellow=intelligence. The spirit behind the candles is this: you light them all at 11:30. At exactly 12 midnight (New Year's eve!), you put them out. Then you arrange the candles from the shortest to the tallest. The candle that burnt the fastest (the shortest one) is the FIRST fortune of yours that will be granted in the new year. The next short one is the second fortune that will be granted, and so on and so forth.  Our fortunes that will be granted in 2004 (per the Prosperity Candles) in chronological order are as follows: 1) Love, 2) Money, 3) Spiritual Growth, 4)Career, 5) Health, 6) Intelligence, 7) Peace. :) Not bad!  As my MIL said, maybe this year will be blessed with a baby because love was the #1 fortune. Let's wait and see! Happy New Year everyone!

      Lovely hand-in-hand stroll around Greenbelt. Wonderful spicy dinner at Banana Leaf -- perfect orders, great service, interesting conversations. Relaxing foot reflexology (for him) and a foot spa (for me) as we caught up on the Hollywood buzz. To end, two Haagen-Dazs strawberry ice cream cones as we walked hand-in-hand around the streets of the seemingly quiet metro. 9 months and we still behave like lovestruck teenagers. :)

       An early morning conversation this morning, at work:  Me: "I got a body skill! I saw a gym and then went to the punching bag 'til I gained one body point." H: "How'd you do that?! Where were you?" Me: "I just walked and walked and saw this gym. There was even a boxing ring and a mirror so you can practice your charisma." H: "Whoa!"  An officemate passes by.  Officemate: "Oi! I thought a couple of buddies were talking. I didn't think it was a husband and wife talking that way!"  That was nice. :) Nothing like Game Boy Advance talk to bring out our inner geeks.   It's our 9th month wedding anniversary today. I don't know if we're doing anything special. We might catch a movie. Hmmm, depends on the workload for today.  Tip: Always have a certified copy of your marriage certificate on hand!!! It's such a hassle to wait for a week or two. I have mine delivered by  urlLink e-census.  It's pretty convenient, but I always forget to order an extra set whenever I need one. You never know when you need one! Now I know better.

      Last week, the household help at my parents' place had a day off work. Patti, my younger sister, was the designated cook. So here's the story... Patti's cooking pancakes in the kitchen.   Maxine, my 8-yo-cousin (shouting from the dining room):  Ate Patti nasaan na yun pancakes?   (Where are my pancakes?)    Patti (flipping pancakes in the kitchen):  Wait lang!  Maxine (already hungry):  Asan na yun pancakes?   (Where are the pancakes?)    Patti:  Wait lang Maxine!  Maxine:  FASTER, SLUT!!!  Patti freezes, dumbfounded. Mama and Jennie also stop what they're doing in surprise.    Patti:  Maxine, what did you say?!?!?!  Maxine looks at the floor.   Patti:  Maxine, do you know what slut means?!?!?!?!!?  Maxine keeps her chin down, quiet. Patti tries to control her anger, but tries to control her laughter at the same time. Patti:  A slut is a prostitute! (Patti rambles on what slut means)  Maxine looks up and defiantly shouts: Hindi no! Ang ibig sabihin non animal na mabagal!!!   (Of course not! It means it's a slow animal!)    Patti is quiet, then bursts out laughing. Patti:  "Maxine, sloth yun! Hindi slut! Wala ka namang H eh."   ("Maxine, that's a sloth. Not slut! You didn't have an H.")    Giggles burst all over the room from the girls.

      Thanks for all the get-well-soon wishes. :) I have slightly recovered from that very bad bout with cough and colds. A bit of a cold is still lingering, but it's not as bad. Thanks again, dear friends. Now on to my ramblings...  I finished  urlLink  The DaVinci Code   in two days flat.  I simply could not put the book down. I loved it, I loved it, I loved it. There's a lot of speculation involved though. Maybe that's why it didn't get good reviews on Amazon. But since I don't rely much on what the critics think, I read the book anyway. Loved it. It makes me want to read up more on the Holy Grail. Maybe I should find a copy of "The Woman with the Alabaster Jar..." Anyway, I'm now starting to read The Valkyries by Paulo Coelho and The Nanny Diaries (though I have a really hard time starting to read this one...).  I tried to change the look of my blog yesterday but failed miserably. I have yet to learn more about web page design.   The American Idol auditions are funny with a capital F. I can't believe some people who tried out think they are Broadway material. Some had really really bad voices. I could sing better than them. And I'm no Broadway singer. I'm just a good videoke singer. But you gotta admire their drive and their guts to try out. For me, that offsets their bad voices.  What's the wifely tip for today.... hmmm... lemme think... okay this one: When words fail you, when solutions are beyond your grasp, when control eludes you, and you can't bear seeing your hubby so sad, the best thing you can give him is a warm embrace.  That will help assure him that things can get better, that things won't be that bad. :) Ah, the power of touch!

      I've been so sick the past couple of days. I got a cold and now I have cough (with phlegm... ew!). I really want to rest. I just want to lie in bed and stare at the ceiling then eventually drift off to sleep. But here I am at work, waiting for my meeting.  As H told me (and this is my wifely tip), "Go home already. You'll never run out of work. And when you get sick, all you're going to get from the office is flowers anyway. Go home and rest." -- short of saying there's a time to work and a time to rest.  Another tip is to take Benadryl Antihistamine capsules (25mg): 1 tablet 3x a day. It's really effective. My coughing subsided after a day of taking it. But I haven't fully recovered yet so here I am coughing like an old woman. But of course, ask your doctor first before taking these meds.  Here's wishing the rest of you are in better health.

      I tried your Avocado Donut and I will not mince words: It sucks. It is an offense to avocados and avocado lovers everywhere!!! I am an avocado fanatic -- avocado is my favorite ice cream yogurt flavor, and I can't get enough of fresh avocados (never mind if it has a million calories in it). Your doughnut with avocado frosting was something else. It smelled funny, and tasted even funnier. It had a weird chemical taste to it, and an even more appalling aftertaste. Thank goodness I had a cup of coffee beside me to wash that first bite down. I took another bite, hoping that the first bite was just a fluke, but nooo. It was even worse than the first. That was the beginning of the end of my love affair with you.  To make up for that twice-bitten doughnut, I bought my favorite Dunkin' Donut -- strawberry filled. It is a classic. Well, it  was   a classic. The doughnut was full of air, for crying out loud, and there was not much  strawberry filling at all. I remember the days when I'd bite into it and strawberry jelly would ooze out the sides, and I'd lick it joyously. But now, I had to get to the center of the doughnut to taste the strawberry jelly. It seemed that there was less than a teaspoon of jelly in it. I felt so cheated. You can't call that a strawberry- filled  doughnut.   This is the end of my love affair with Dunkin Donuts. I have been a loyal customer but now, I shall break my loyalty. You were our family doughnut!!! I will miss the days when my family and I would buy a dozen doughnuts and Munchkins from you. I remember when my sister fell on her face while munching on your strawberry-filled doughnut. There was jam all over her mouth, tears streaming down her cheeks, but your strawberry filled doughnut padded her fall, saving her teeth from breaking.   I am back on my quest for the best strawberry-filled doughnut.  Good thing there's Country Style, Mister Donuts and the new Gonuts Donuts that I have yet to try. Sadly, Dunkin Donuts, you will no longer be on my list. You have broken my heart. Adios.

      We finally moved in and boy, are our bodies aching or what! We started most of the packing last Thursday, and it has been a long three days. I am so glad we've finally settled with all our things at the condo. Now all we gotta do is clean the place up and unpack. That will take some time I think, but we're not rushing.  The very first piece we bought for the condo was a zen fountain. It's so awesome. I gotta take a picture of it sometime. We bought 3 rocks that have the following engraved on them: "Bloom" (my pick), "Health" and "Celebration" (H's picks). We have one side of our living room that we call our "relaxation corner." So we're gonna put that fountain on the table, along with some scented candles. Oooh yeah.   Though we live in the middle of the city, we try to find ways to still be in touch with nature. We got a couple of CDs on nature sounds: the peaceful crashing of the waves, the sweet chirping of birds, the refreshing sound of the summer rain, those things. It's pretty interesting and make you forget you're living in a condo.   We've also agreed on a theme for our new home: country living! After much debate, we've finally settled for mint green, sky blue and cedar as the main colors. Let's see if we remain faithful to that!   When you don't see eye-to-eye on  furninshings or other home stuff, take it easy! H and I walk around the mall a bit more, buy old home design magazines and check out the pictures. No need to rush! We still haven't found the perfect bedsheets or the perfect slipcover for the couch, but we'll get there. Slowly but surely, we'll transform this bare white place into a cozy home. :)

      I'm feeling so sick I wanna throw up. I've been on a no-meat diet the past week or so because I'm supporting hubby's cholesterol-free diet.  I sorta cheated today and bought pancit palabok from Red Ribbon. Halfway through the dish, I was feeling queasy already. Three quarters through the dish, I couldn't take it anymore. I felt the oil swimming in my throat and head. Guilt and oil don't mix very well.  I threw out the remains of the palabok and am now in Queasyland. The good thing is, this will keep me off meat and oily food for a long time, I'll be thin! The bad thing is, I don't know how long this queasiness will last.  *mentally barfs*  Yuck, that doesn't work. I feel worse. Oh well. This is what I get for eating those noodles.   The wonderful thing about going on a diet together is that you empathize with each other. I feel the difficulty as well of not getting to eat that fried milkfish that we both really like, or that crunchy bacon. And I would never even dream of eating those sausages while he eats his steamed veggies across me. That's evil! So we stick it out together, get our grilled tuna kebabs and just laugh at how hard it is to eat healthy. We just imagine how thin we'll be after we get used to this meat-free diet. That pulls us through even more!

      A really bad case of PMS has put me in the dumps today. Thank goodness for my morning coffee and my toasted bagel -- morning comfort food. Mmmmm. I'm slightly cheerier now. What's your morning picker-upper?  Side story: We've sold most of our big stuff already (washing machine, air conditioner...) and have given out some little things already (bread box, coasters, salt and pepper shaker, napkin holder, a plastic shelf...). Anyone want to buy  urlLink a dining set ?  Beabear gets first dibs though. ;) If you're interested, send me an e-mail.

       Story #1:  I bought the soundtrack of  Something's Gotta Give  last night. *dreamy smiles* I'm listening to it right now, here, at work. It's so nice. So romantic. When we move to our new place, I'm gonna prepare a special dinner for the hubby, by candlelight no less. I need easy-to-prepare dishes though as I am no professional cook. Oh well, I can always get takeout at Italianni's and put it on nice china. Hehehe. I highly recommend this soundtrack for those quiet moments with your sweetie.    Story #2: "Love Actually"  was awesome. The hubby was less than enthusiastic since he didn't like Notting Hill. I was extremely relieved when I saw him smiling during the opening credits. Whew! We both loved loved loved this film. Love is everywhere! Love is all around you! I will buy the DVD and play it during our Christmas party. Hahaha! That is, I remember to do that. I'll get the OST sometime. If you haven't seen it, go go go.  Indulge the romantic within you. Go, go, go!

      There's this new junkfood I discovered through my officemate -- Oishi's  Oheya!   They're corn chips. Period. Nothing more. What's good about it is that it's cheap and yummy. Haha!    urlLink Clover Chips  are always a hit when served at parties. That's exactly what I did yesterday at my parents' party. My cousins took turns eating out of the bag. Yummy. Cheese is my favorite flavor.  Other party snacks that you can serve that will always satisfy your guests are:  urlLink Chiz Curls, Chippy,  and  urlLink Nagaraya  cracker nuts.  Mmmmm. I'm craving for Nagaraya now. Original flavor.    ~*~*~*~    Belated Friday Five, borrowed from  urlLink Tin :    If you: 1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  Delicious, healthy food. The kinds of food that are super yummy but are not fattening. I'll think up a juicy steak that's still good for the heart. Sounds like a very difficult restaurant to start up.   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  A variety of books, writing materials (paper, journals, pens, pencils), giftwrapper, paper bags, bookmarks. I'll call the store "Papyrus."    3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  Being a romantic, it'll probably be, duh, a romance novel. Haha!   4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  I'd teach Arts and Crafts. :)   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  Easy listening. Norah Jones-ish. That is, if I had her voice!

      Well, we got the condo! :) We've signed our contract (yey!) and we start moving in stuff at the end of the month.   We've been packing our stuff and boy, do my joints ache or what!!! My clothes are almost organized (see previous entry!), and now it's time to fix our furniture and appliances. Does anyone want to buy a slightly used aircon? Or a slightly used dining table with 6 chairs? Maybe I should post pics here. The place we're getting is fully furnished so our furniture have no place in the condo.  Any moving out tips? I'm buying a lot of garbage bags (to put my clothes in, as we have a shortage of suitcases), a couple of balikbayan boxes (that's where we'll put the smaller stuff like clocks, tupperware, gosh, my shoes, etc.). And we still have to disassemble our bed! That's gonna be a tough task. And our curtains! Whatever will we do with our curtains now! We need blinds for our condo, not those curtains anymore.   The truth is I'm more excited than I am frantic about this moving thing. Still, I'd really appreciate moving out tips. :D

      I cleaned out my bedroom this weekend and ended up with 2 huge boxes of old clothes. Surprisingly, I found it easy to part with my old shirts and dresses. I found it hard to part with my jeans. :( A lot of them no longer fit me, so I have no choice but to give them away.  Selling them or making bags out of my old jeans crossed my mind... but I realized that more people need these clothes than I need a denim bag or extra cash. I mean, extra cash would always be nice, but I know I'd feel guilty thinking that there's a person out there with no shirt to wear. So I folded the clothes and put them in a box labeled "Toni's Wear-Them-Well Donations." I said a bit of a prayer while packing them -- a prayer that whoever would receive the clothes would, er, wear them well.   This was a weekend that was good for the soul. :)

      H and I have decided to move to a new place. We've viewed several condos, but we've fallen in love with the last one we saw. We're hoping we can close the deal with the owner by Friday.  Though I can be spontaneous and just go with the flow of the moment, times like these I can't sit still until it is formalized on paper.  This will be the longest three days of my life. Friends, I ask that you keep us in our prayers, that we will be able to finally move to a place where we feel secure and happy. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

       This post is especially for those watch-lovers out there.   I wear a wristwatch practically everyday because of work meetings, appointments, etc. If I don't have my watch, I have my cell phone by my side so I can check on the time. Though being aware of the time does help you avoid tardiness and meet deadlines, sometimes you just have to let go of watching the time.  Pick a day (preferably the weekend!) when you won't wear your watch. You'll be surprised at how events go by so joyously. You live the moment, and not have any baggage on what to do next or up to what time you can only enjoy that moment. Yesterday was an eye-opener for me. It happened by accident.  I forgot to wear my watch! I went about my "spring-cleaning" and didn't feel any pressure to finish up at a particular time. As a result of that, I actually got more work done. After the cleaning chore, H and I visited my folks at Pleasantville (a.k.a. Suburbia!) and enjoyed the rest of the afternoon and evening there. We ate yummy take-out food, had a lot of laughs with my cousin Maxine and her folks, hammed it up for my sister's videocam. All of us even stayed in the neighborhood playground. My sister and I lay side by side on the double-slide, watching the sky turn from blue to pink. It was soooo relaxing. We rode bicycles (I rode the one with training wheels) and went round and round the block. It was g-l-o-r-i-o-u-s. Dinner was fun because we all ate together and even used our hands. Fun fun fun! A lot of good times happened yesterday.   If I had a watch, I would've probably been pestering H to go home already, since we had work the next day. I would've probably stopped biking after 30 minutes, ate an afternoon snack for 30, taken a siesta for 30... you know the drill. Being without a watch felt so liberating.  I felt a kind of fun I didn't feel in ages -- the kind of fun you feel when you're a kid. You play and play like there's no tomorrow. That's exactly the fun I felt.  It's good for the heart. It's good for the soul.  It's a Monday, meetings are abound, and my watch is back on my left wrist. I look forward to the weekend again, when my wrist will be watch-free, and time won't restrict me from spreading my arms out wide and running around the village with my family like we're all 5-year-olds again.

      Wifely tip before the survey thing: When God closes a door, he opens a window. Keep believing in that line. Never lose hope. Will expound on that more when I can spill the beans on good news. In the meantime, survey says...     1. Name three good things about yourself.  1- I care about other peopleâ€™s happiness. 2- Iâ€™m very sincere. 3- I know when to speak and when not to.   2. Name three bad things about yourself.  1- Iâ€™m insecure. 2- I procrastinate. 3- I get irritated easily.   3. Name three things you can do, or have done, that most people can't or haven't.  1- I have written a poem on the back of a teabagâ€™s packet. 2- I have never given up on love despite numerous heartbreaks. 3- I can write for a whole day.   4. Name three emotions you feel most often.  1- Frustration 2- Deep love 3- Happiness   5.

      For those in the Philippines, you guys gotta try this out: Jollibee's Tuna Pie. It's yummmmy. And it only costs P16.00! Better than a Doritos craving, money-wise. It's really not that bad. You have to try it.

      At my parents' house, there's always a ton of jam bottles, jelly bottles, peanut butter jars, all filled to the brim because nobody's eating 'em. The folks at home usually eat whatever's laid out for them, not in the mood to look into the cupboard and the ref unless really necessary. So what has happened is that we've accumulated quite a number of strawberry jam bottles from Baguio, peanut butter of different brands, untouched guava jelly, etc.  Solution? Lay them all out on the dining table beside a basket of Pugon pandesal. One jar of strawberry jam has been finished in a couple of days. The second bottle of strawberry jam is on its way. Can't believe the solution was that simple!

      I couldn't get into Blogger over the past 2 weeks! My fingers were itching to blog but the computer just wouldn't cooperate with me... but anyway!   Some nice kwento (stories): - Last Thursday, I cleaned the bathroom for the first time in my whole life! I felt so proud. Heehee. (Background: I was never raised to perform household chores. So this is a mighty achievement for me!) Now I clean the bathroom every other day.  - I'm excited! Mama and I are watching the Bocelli concert on Friday. Ooooh. I hope it's good. I bought the tickets as a special gift for her. I hope she enjoys! - Here's a nice "meal" I discovered: H and I LOVE  urlLink Zaragoza's Spanish Sardines in Olive Oil.   Totally healthy and yummy! H likes his with rice. As for me, I grab two slices of wheat bread and use the sardines as palaman (filling). Mmm mmm good. It's always on my shopping list. ;)   Some not-so-nice kwento: - Our water heater tank BURST last week. Ugh. Our kitchen and part of the dining area was flooded, man! I had to stay up till midnight wiping the mess up. It's fixed now, but we still need to find a replacement. We've had no hot water for the past week. =( The good thing is it's still a very hot summer here, so the cold water is welcoming. We're back to heating water in the kettle and pouring it into the bath water. Finding a replacement is not an easy task, but we target to have one installed by the end of summer. - Termites might be eating into my closet! I say "might be eating" because it still has to be fully checked out. For now, I dig my office clothes straight out of a suitcase. - My grandfather (how ironic... my previous entry was about him and my grandma) got hospitalized this week. An aneurysm was found in his abdomen. Plus a lump the size of a fist in his left lung. Not exactly good news. More tests are being conducted. I'm asking for prayers for his speedy recovery. I've exhausted myself of tears already. That's a good thing, considering I'm helping out in the hospital by running errands like photocopying stuff, buying people's lunches, those things. I'd be too tired to cry. We're all trying to be strong for Wowo. Please do pray he gets better.  And now... gotta catch up on reading your blogs!!!

      I called up Wowo and Maymee this afternoon to update them on some little things (paperwork and stuff). The supposed 5-minute talk turned out to be much longer, and I missed them a lot.  Maymee and I talked about the Thanksgiving Mass I wanted to offer (she sells Mass cards). I wanted to give thanks to Him for our new home. She sounded very interested in our new condo unit. She says she and Wowo want to visit us soon. I told her we'd have to clean up the condo first. Heehee. I feel the pressure! She used to be a Home Economics teacher, you see. She's very particular about order at home!  Wowo and I laughed as he told the story of him trying to call me on my cell phone over and over, only to have the operator say "This line is no longer connected." Turns out he was calling my cell phone number of 4 years ago. He said his cell phone was suffering from Alzheimer's. Heehee.  Wowo and Maymee are my maternal grandparents. They're 82 and 81 years old, respectively. I don't see them that often anymore. When I lived with my folks in Quezon City, their home was just a 5-minute drive away. I rarely see them now. I don't even talk to them on the phone that much. Though I was with them last Good Friday, it feels like it has been many months since we were together.  As we were saying our goodbyes, I told my grandmother that I loved her. She said she loved me too. Now my grandfather is kinda military-ish so I'm not as demonstrative to him. Hence, I told Maymee, "Please tell Wowo that I love him." She goes, "Papa! Toni says she loves you very much." Then she puts Wowo on the line (who apparently didn't hear her) and he goes, "Toni?" I go, "Wowo! I love you!" He laughs (I can picture his toothy smile and chinky eyes in my head) and says, "Thank you!" Then we say bye-bye.  I was kinda teary-eyed after that phone call. I've always been very vocal about my feelings with my own parents, but not too much with my grandparents. I'd hug them and kiss them but not say those words that often. I know it's because I'm  nahihiya  (kinda embarrassed) to do that. And now I wonder, why should I be ashamed? I won't let my Wowo's military posture to get to me. I know he's a mushy old bear within. :) And Maymee is just sunshine and roses to me.  Grandparents are truly wonderful. They give you a different kind of comfort and love. It's as fuzzy as a blankie and as soothing as a cup of hot cocoa. Do constantly pray for their strength and their health. And do tell them you love them every chance you get.

      "You're a gift from God. You owe it to yourself to constantly improve yourself."  Wise words from a friend. It was mentioned so casually during a breakfast conversation but it hit me really hard.   I have decided to: a) Stop cursing. Being in the advertising industry has influenced me to curse every now and then (haha!), so I will avoid all temptation and all impulses to say the F and the S word. b) Get my poems together. The idea of a book has always been in my head. I have the title in my head, a bit of the layout, but that's it... it's all in my head. I already know the steps on how to publish a book, hopefully I see it through. c) Read more. The more you read, the wider your vocabulary gets. More wisdom from the same friend. I've bought a lot of books and magazines over the past months, but never had enough time to read them all. I will try to read more and watch TV less.  I know I have to do a lot more, but hey, I'm taking baby steps. These are my April resolutions. I know! I'll have a monthly resolution thing. Yeah, that'll be a good reminder. :)

      I hope you don't ever have a reason to do this, but in case you do, here's a pretty helpful first aid tip in temporarily treating a bloody cut: Use a sanitary napkin -- wrap it around (or cover) that bloody wound.   I wish I had remembered that tip. I read it once in a print ad for the Army. It's been in my head for the longest time, labeled "Stock Knowledge." H ran to me with a bloody finger yesterday -- he had cut his left index finger deeply with a big cutter. It was a gross sight, blood was dripping all over his hand. I'll spare you the rest of the gory details. All I could do was grab as many tissue sheets as possible to wrap around his wounded finger. We rushed to the ER. Four little stitches equalled ounces of pain. I was holding on to his right hand the whole time, asking him to squeeze my hand every time the treatment would hurt. I was leaning over him the whole time, whispering words of assurance in his ear, even singing to him a little lullabye to calm him down (much to his embarassment haha!).   He's been treated, we're continuing to treat his cut, we've got all the medication and supplies (gauze, tape, etc) needed, but my legs still turn to jelly everytime we talk about the accident. We're thankful that it wasn't any worse. We're thankful that it didn't happen to his right hand (he's a rightie). We're thankful that we weren't hysterical yesterday. He told me I didn't appear panicky. The truth was, everything was a blur but I did manage to stay calm. I just kept praying for strength (his and mine -- I'm scared of blood!) and comfort. In the meantime, we're steering clear of sharp objects.  So... have a sanitary napkin on hand all the time if possible, and be careful when using sharp objects.  And oh... Happy Easter!

      To take candle wax off your shoes or jeans, do this simple procedure: a) Put a cube of ice over the wax stains to make them a bit harder, a bit more solid. b) Place a paper napkin over the wax stain. c) Iron over the paper towel -- the stain'll stick to the paper towel.  -- Advice from my Mom after she saw the million candle wax drops stuck to my jeans and rubber shoes after yesterday's procession. :)

      I made my very first ice cream! I went to a cooking seminar today, sponsored by Work. Yipee! One of our many assigned recipes was Peanut Butter Ice Cream. I'm sharing it with you:  Ingredients: Eggs, whole, 2 pieces Sugar, 150 grams Peanut butter, chunky, 150 grams  Whipping creme, (liquid) 400 ml Milk, 400 ml Chocolate Chips (semi-sweet), 120 grams   Preparation: 1. Whisk eggs and sugar until light, add the peanut butter and mix until smooth. 2. Mix whipping creme and milk. Stir the chocolate chips. 3. Transfer mixture to ice cream maker and process. (When the mixture looks thick enough, then it's practically done. It took us around an hour for processing.) 4. Freeze in covered container until ready to serve.  It was delicious. Yum yum yum. It was as good as Selecta's Chocopeanut ice cream. It was really easy! I would love to do this recipe for my family but I don't have an ice cream maker. And to do it manually is way too tiring. But I am definitely keeping this recipe on file... who knows? Maybe someone's gonna gift me with an ice cream maker or H & I splurge on one sometime. This recipe is for keeps!

      "Follow your hopes and dreams. Some opportunities come once in a lifetime. It's better to try than always wonder what could have been."  I had a phone interview today for a company abroad. I knew I was too junior for what they wanted, but I went for it anyway. I was seriously contemplating on not continuing that interview anymore. But I'm glad I pushed through with it. I had a nice chat with the company head. We were very honest with each other, she telling me my working experience was short of 2 years of what they needed, me telling her the same thing. Still the talk went beautifully and I was able to share some of my passions about advertising with her. I think it turned out pretty well. She did say that when the time comes for them to beef up their team, she'd give me a call. I said that was very much fine with me.   I'm happy the interview went well. I'm happy that she liked me. But most of all, I'm happy that I did go for the interview, even if some doubts were pulling me down last week. I never would've opened this door had I listened to those doubts in my head.   I may not have been meant to walk through THIS door, but I'm glad I was able to open it for awhile and chat with the person on the other end. I have a feeling a similar door will open for me soon. Hopefully, I walk through that door. Let's wait and see. :)

      I keep a little notebook with me everywhere I go. I take it out everytime I read a magazine or a book. I don't like using highlighter or writing on the pages of my books, so whenever a passage strikes me, I write it down in my little notebook. It's a good source of inspiration and a pretty good way to start generating ideas, especially when you're having a mental block. I just whip out my little blue friend and ta-da! Quotes and inspirations galore. More importantly, my books are spared of semi-fluorescent markers.

      One year ago today, I was dressed in a flowing white gown and he in a barong tagalog. I carried a bouquet of pink and orange gerberas and a wide smile on my face. He wore a nervous grin on his face and beads of sweat decorated his forehead. I walked down the aisle to our wedding song, "The Prayer", and he waited at the altar, tears shining in his eyes. What bonded us the best was not the "You may kiss the bride" bit, but the embrace we shared after that first kiss as husband and wife. It was the embrace that would start a life of warm embraces, a life of holding each other come what may.   One year ago today was the beginning of many happy days together. I can't wait to see what this second year of togetherness will bring us. :)

      I got a lot of flack from my friends last Friday night. As I gave my best friend a hug, he goes, "Why do you smell like a man?!" My girl friend shrieks, "Ikaw pala yon!!!!!" (So that was you!!!)  Uh-oh. Looks like my Johnson's Baby Cologne didn't work. I reluctantly took out the small pink bottle and told them it was called "Morning Dew" and well... didn't I smell like the morning dew? (Haha...)  A fit of hysterical shrieks and giggles burst out. And a big N-O too. A couple more friends arrived and after letting them smell the cologne, they did say it did smell like a man's musk. A friend recommended Bench. Maybe I'll drop by that store sometime.  Oh well. We left the "Morning Dew" bottle at the coffee shop. Maybe a guy would pick it up, and hopefully, he uses it and gets compliments like, "You're so manly!"  Lesson learned! If it smells like a man, well, it's not for me.

      Gifts don't have to be grand. Gifts don't have to come only on an occasion. I find that gifts are best liked if they're unexpected too.   H came home last night with a grocery bag saying, "I have a surprise for you!" He whipped out 3 packs of  urlLink Lucky Me Supreme (Sotanghon Soup) . He said, "Sometimes you tell me that you're hungry but there's nothing to eat here, and I know you like these..." ( Like  these? I  love  these!) And then he told me he had another surprise. He took out 3 Selecta ChocoPeanut Ice Cream Bars. My favorite! I was jumping up and down. And finally, because he knew I craved for chocolate every now and then, he bought me a bar of Toblerone. Mmm.  It was really sweet. The funny thing was, I had a surprise for him too. I surprised him with a big dinner from Aristocrat. (Delivery is my best friend!) We had a feast with the Chicken Barbeque, Atsara, BBQ sauce, Java Rice, Crab and Corn soup, Sotanghon Soup, and pancit canton. We indulged ourselves by washing down the yummy dinner with ice cold Coca-Cola. I had my ChocoPeanut dessert.  And then we watched our favorite silly show, Blind Date. After that, I snoozed beside him on the couch wrapped like a lumpia in my rainbow-colored sarong (it was cold!) while he watched a Titanic documentary.  That's how we usually spend our weeknights. Our little "lambingans." And the little surprises come often, too. These little things make me feel ten-feet-tall. :)

      I subscribe to Globe's HerInspiration, and they send out daily doses of inspiration like this one. I loved this particular message. I forwarded this quote to about all my friends last night:  "There are times we have so many questions and seem to have no answers. The answers will soon come. Enjoy life's little surprises."  I don't think I'm the most spontaneous person in this world. I'm probably about 80% a planner, and 20% a spontaneous gal. Yep, I'm into schedules and routines and planning things out. I've started loosening up since H and I got together --- thank goodness! So many questions have been filling my head lately. When will we have children? Will I ever get a raise? Where will I be by the time I'm 30? What should I have accomplished by then? When is the best time to buy that kitchen shelf? How much will termite control cost? What time should I leave the house tomorrow morning?   When I got that text message, it hit home. Yup. I can't be in control all the time. I should let go of all the questions in my head, even for just a moment. It's difficult, but it has to be done.   As H would say, "Wifey, relaaaaax."  *reluctantly lets go of her pen and To-Do list.....*  (Okay, Husby! I'll try my best!)

      I can't help it. After a day of work, I always, ALWAYS have spare change in my pocket. I have a coin purse in my bag but still loose change finds it way to my jeans pocket. I think if I do the Dance of Joy (remember  urlLink Perfect Strangers ?), a certain jingling and chiming would help keep the beat of the dance.  Solution? The money box. We bought a really nice looking wooden box from  urlLink Landmark  (Cheap finds! Value finds!). Whenever we arrive home, we head for it and empty our pockets. As of this morning, I think there was about 30-something pesos in change there... a mix of 25 centavo coins, 1 peso coins, 5 peso and 10 peso coins.  The other good thing about it is whenever we're in need for spare change, we don't have to go looking under the couch or in the pockets of my office bag. I need spare change whenever I ride the cab or when I need to get coffee from the vending machine at work, so our money box is a big convenience. Meanwhile, I'll work my way up to putting in paper bills in the money box sometime...  (I still do the Dance of Joy in my weird and wacky moments, but the jingling and chiming's all in my head now.)

      Guess what my Dad gave my Mom for Mother's Day? An electric toothbrush. You read that right. An electric toothbrush.  We were all in the family car last Sunday when he asked my younger sister to take out his present. It was in a beautiful paper bag. My Mom looked so excited! She reached into the paper bag, and a lopsided smile flashed across her face. An electric toothbrush. My sisters and I broke into giggles in the backseat.  My Mom was obviously disturbed by this, well, appliance. How totally unromantic right? Wrong. While my Mom flipped the toothbrush over and over (trying to get to love it I guess), my Dad continued driving and started to tell her why this was such a great toothbrush.  "There's a timer so you brush your upper set of teeth for 1 minute... When the vibrating stops, you turn it on again because it's time to brush your lower set of teeth. So you know when to start and stop brushing..."  My Mom softened up a bit after hearing Dad enthusiastically tell her about the features of this electric toothbrush. I think he really thought it was romantic. It's the thought that counts. :) And at least he's concerned about my Mom's oral health!

      I miss my girlfriends. They're all over the country, and I see them once in a blue moon. My best friend is a guy. My other best friend is my husband, who is, obviously, a guy. (Is it possible to have two best friends, by the way?) I digress. I was talking about girlfriends.  I'm not exactly  kikay  1 , but I do have my girlie moments. For example, I want to have my eyebrows threaded, get a haircut, possibly some highlights, get a facial, get a massage, go shopping, go window-shopping, all those girlie things. But I'm stuck in  losyang 2  land  for now. Though I CAN be kikay and do those kikay stuff on my own, it's not as fun as doing with a friend.   My officemate and I were talking about girlfriends once, and I realized I didn't have a constant girl buddy. By constant I mean someone I see every week, or every other week, someone I can talk girl stuff with. I have a lot of girlfriends, but not one who's really close to me, proximity-wise as well.   It's not a terrible case. I'm very happy with the circle of friends I have. I just miss having to chatter endlessly while getting your nails done together. Come to think of it, I've never done that with a friend.   Having guys for best friends is huge fun and a huge advantage. But a girl best friend? That's still entirely different, and someone I wish I had. There'll be that constant buddy I can watch girly movies with or just talk and do girl stuff with.   But for now, I'll be going to the parlor alone, cherishing my quiet time before walking back out into the noisy city. For now, I'll be reading through fashion magazines alone, still wondering whether this outfit would make my hips look big. For now, I'll be watching girly movies with my officemates, or just be catching them on DVD so I can watch them at home. For now (and as always), I'll be looking forward to the elusive and precious coffee and dinner dates my girlfriends and I have. (Miss you, beautiful girls of LHC!)   Lucky are those who have these best girly buddies. Treasure them, cherish them, have fun with them, the way only girls can.    1  Very girlie. Hmmm. I can't think of an apt translation for this word.  2  A woman letting herself go. Haha!

Or is this too much? I wonder. I wonder. *slaps her forehead* I forgot to buy Calcium tablets.    Wishing they could do MY home  Finally saw Queer Eye for the Straight Guy on ETC! last night. I've fallen in love with the show. I wish the Fab Five were my friends. I wish they could help fix up our home and my wardrobe. Heehee.   Loving the new look!

      Ever since Day 1 of my married life, people have been asking me if I'm pregnant or already have kids. I tell them in my usual cheery voice, "Coming soon!" I don't mind the questioning really. What I do mind is when they ask, "So are you pregnant yet?" and then they reach out and touch my tummy. Even total strangers do that. Well, okay, not strangers... acquaintances is more the appropriate term.   I'm a demonstrative person. I like hugging people, holding on to their arms, giving them a pat on the back. I only do this however to people close to me. So it really irritates me when people who I hardly consider close friends reach out and touch my tummy. I wanna say, "Watch the hand! You're invading my personal space!"   Receiving a pat on the back from an acquaintance for a job well done is fine. But a pat on the tummy? All I do is freeze. Sometimes I inhale so they don't feel my love handles (LOL!). The truth is I get really annoyed. I mean, I don't do that to my pregnant friends. If I wanna feel their tummy, I ask for permission first.   I just had to let that out. Just because you're asking or concerned if your friend's pregnant, it doesn't give you the right to reach out and touch her tummy! Never forget the concept of personal space, man!   Maybe I should wear a shirt that says, "No, I am not yet pregnant so don't even think of touching my tummy." Heehee.

      I'm not a die-hard classical music fan, but I do like listening to it to relax. To help me appreciate classical music, I try imagining a story while the music plays. I make the stories up in my head! If the music's all tinkly and light, I imagine bunnies hopping in the meadow. If it's low and loud, I imagine sharks in the ocean circling a tugboat. Letting my imagination run wild was what I did at the Bocelli concert last Friday.   I thank Bocelli for making my Mom have a fantastic time. She was in tears while at the concert! She was even humming along to the songs. I was at the concert more for her, than for him. I was super happy that she enjoyed herself.  I thank Bocelli for sparking in me my old love of writing short stories. With all the songs he sang, stories unfolded in my head. My imagination ran wild -- I thought of little girl's tales, rainbows and butterflies... children's stories! I had a bunch of children's stories in my memory as we stepped out of the concert. I couldn't wait to write them down!  The next day, I wrote two of the stories that popped in my head. I wanted to see how it would turn out so I read them both to my 9-year-old cousin, Maxine. She LOVED them! And I was so happy. I loved seeing her eyes widen and her smile grow bigger while I read the story out loud. And when the second story was done, she said, "Ang ganda!" ("It's beautiful!"). That made my day!!!  I now want to buy all of Bocelli's CDs. I can't wait to just put them on the player and listen to them during the weekend, sit lazily on the couch and listen to his heavenly voice. Then I'll just let my imagination wander. And more short stories will come out.  Another way to get the creative juices flowing! :)

      Sinigang is one of the most popular Filipino soupy dishes. This is a very simple meat and vegetable tamarind-based soup we eat with rice. The most popular meat used is pork (Sinigang na Baboy). For alternatives, one can also use beef, shrimp or milkfish. Other souring ingredients can also be used aside from tamarind. For example, some cooks use calamansi or kamias. They taste just as yummy and work especially well with shrimp and milkfish. I am loyal to the Knorr tamarind-soup base though.  A friend of mine told me that she had experimented with another version of Sinigang --  Sinigang na Tuyo.  Now, "tuyo" is a dry, salted fish. It is usually fried in oil and eaten with fried rice ("sinangag"). One can also have a healthy serving of tomatoes on the side to add some sweetness to this tuyo-and-rice meal. Oh, Filipino food is yummy. Anyway, Sinigang na Tuyo sounded pretty adventurous so I decided to try it myself this weekend.  My mom's cook had prepared Sinigang na Baboy already, so I just used part of the mixture for my "experiment." I had the uncooked tuyo soaked in water first, so the scales could be removed more easily. Afterwards, we mixed in the tuyo with the small helping of the Knorr tamarind-soup base and vegetables. I let it simmer until the fish looked cooked enough.  The verdict? The tamarind-based soup was pleasantly sour, with just the right spike of saltiness from the tuyo. The tuyo was not too fabulous. I think I should've fried it a bit prior to placing it in the soup for simmering. Frying might have given the tuyo a more "vibrant" flavor.  I could eat the soup on its own. I could eat the tuyo alone. But I couldn't eat the soup and the tuyo in one spoonful. It was just too salty. I've never eaten anything saltier than that dish! I couldn't eat too much of everything for fear of what could happen to my kidneys.   My Dad liked it, though I think he was just being polite. H called it "Poor Man's Sinigang," as tuyo is regular fare among the lower-class here in the Philippines. I think this experiment is worth another try, only this time, I won't use a tamarind-soup base, maybe a kamias or calamansi soup base for a less sour taste. I'd also fry the tuyo for more flavor, maybe even make sure the tuyo I get is not too salty -- if that's possible.   P.S. Here's a link to  urlLink the usual Sinigang Recipe .

      Did you know that an average mind can only retain 7 units at any given time?  So instead of saying: "Honey, I just took a shower so I still feel fresh and I don't want to smell bad could you take out the trash because it really stinks outside and I don't want to have to take a shower again?"  Say this instead: "Honey, could you take out the trash?"  Happy weekend everyone!

      Dalawang beses nahulog panty ko nung isang gabi.*  I decided to go home early last Tuesday because I was feeling bad (emotionally) at work. I was home around 7:30-ish. Ha! I immediately flopped down on the couch and turned the TV on. Lo and behold, it was my long-time crush on TV, my one and only Tom Welling. I had forgotten about Smallville. It had lost its novelty on me after the first season, though Tom Welling still carried a special place in my heart. So there I was just staring at the TV screen, swooning over Tom Welling. Nevermind if the plot was wishy-washy. He had a semi-love scene (make-out scene in their underwear) with another "mutant" girl so woohoo! I just love big strong arms (as long as they're not Schwarzenegger-ish).  Commercial break! So I channel-surfed again and woah, Ally McBeal on Channel 9. Ally had gotten on my nerves after two or three seasons (she's bordering on pathetic). It was a rerun, and was the 1st episode wherein my other love, James Marsden, appeared. (That's Cyclops of X-Men the movie to you who don't know who he is).   Babe heaven! I switched from Ch 9 to Ch 23 to fulfill my hunk quota factor. They both have something in common -- they're pretty boys (but not lady-like in their beauty, like, hmmm, let's say, LEGOLAS, who I really don't like that much.) They both have dark brown hair and piercing blue eyes. [insert swooning Toni here]  When H came home, I immediately went into my schoolgirl crush mode, telling him exactly every detail of why they made me swoon. He just shook his head, laughed and was amused with my very highschoolish way of crushing on these guys.  Sigh! They are so handsome. I will make it a point to come home early on Tuesdays. Never mind the workload. I'll never run out of work. But my Tom Welling factor? James Marsden? That only comes once a week.  Maybe I should make Tom my love my desktop wallpaper? And James as my screensaver?  Sigh. Too bad they're married. Oh wait. So am I. Hahaha. I lust and love them both!     * "My panties fell twice the other night." Heehee. It's a Filipino expression for a certain kind of attraction.

      Goodbye,  urlLink Mattie Stepanek .  Mattie is a 14-year-old boy who struggled with a rare form of muscular dystrophy. You can read more about him through the link above. He passed away yesterday, June 22nd. Mattie was a very special kid. I first  urlLink saw him in Oprah  and immediately grew to admire this little boy. He wrote poetry. He's a genius of a poet. His poems are composed of the simplest words, yet when put together they create a connection with whoever reads it. His poetry has a way of tugging your heart and bringing tears to your eyes.  urlLink You should hear him read his poetry out loud.  It gives a totally different spin to his poems. Maybe because I can't fathom how such a young and innocent child could write about life's celebrations and even death -- but that is why Mattie is special. He possessed a maturity some of us don't even have. I bought his book once, but never got around to reading it. I was just happy I had part of Mattie's poetry with me.   Here's one of his beautiful poems from the book "Journey Through Heartsongs." It reminds us to be grateful for all the miracles that come our way, may they be big or small. Celebrate these miracles.    Prayer for a Journey   Thank You, God, Not just for life, But for our journey through life. Life is a miracle, And a journey through life Is so full of so many more miracles If we travel with our Heartsongs. Thank You, God, For blessing me with the  Gift of Heartsongs, So that I can enjoy my miracles.   April 1998 Â© Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek   Be safe, Mattie. As you go on another journey, your poetry remains with us and will live on in our hearts. I promise to listen to my Heartsongs more closely. This is what I have learned from you, and I thank you, thank you, for this legacy.

      Even if we live in a tiny condo unit, H and I have our own quiet corners. This is the area where one can leave the other undisturbed. This is the spot where one can be left in his or her reverie, where one feels most rested and calm.   When I was still single and lived with my folks, my Mom's quiet corner was her candlemaking area. It was where she could freely experiment with her candle creations without being bugged by any of us. My Dad's quiet corner is his garden. I continue to be amazed at the hours he spends here, planting trees and flowers. He would come back into the house a bit before sunset, dirty and sweaty, but very much fulfilled. My sister has her quiet corner in front of the television set in our dining room. When she's seated there, nobody is supposed to bug her. It's HER chair, HER spot, HER time alone. She grunts at each one who attempts to talk to her.  In our condo, I've found my quiet corner. It's the right half of our little couch. Why this spot? For one thing, that side is right beside the air conditioner. (Heehee.) Plus, this right half is parallel to a window. I can read in peace there. I can daydream. H knows not to bug me when my nose is buried in a Dragonlance book, or when I'm holding my journal and pen. I love that spot. I like that the couch is neither too soft or too hard. It's just right. I love feeling the aircon's cool caress on my skin when I daydream. I like seeing the sun rays flow through the window blinds and land on our wooden floor. It's a magical little nook for me.  The ironic thing is, H's quiet corner is on the left half of the couch. This is where he usually sits when he watches TV, his favorite way to unwind at the end of the day. Now our couch is only about 4 feet wide so that doesn't leave us much solace, if you literally mean finding comfort in being alone, with no other people near you. Then again, solace isn't only about proximity. It could mean finding comfort in what you alone are doing, regardless if the person next to you is 1 foot away or three miles away. While the TV blares on, H relaxes. Not far from where he is, I'm curled up into a ball with my novel, oblivious to the sounds of the television. I am in my own world, hearing only the roars of the dragons or the sweet exchanges of a man and a woman. We rarely talk to each other for a couple of hours while this happens -- we let each other unwind, recharge, relax. It's an unwritten and unspoken understanding we've reached.  Where's your quiet corner? :)

       Question:   There's a video I want to share with you. How do I upload one on the net so you can see it? Help!   Sharing:   My friend B emailed me yesterday and part of her note went, "I really admire you......for your simplicity and maturity...but most of all, for embracing love and life quietly but passionately." That made me feel warm all over. That is a lesson I'd also like to share with you. You can celebrate life in your own little way, even if it's in small, quiet ways, like I do.   I'm turning 27 in around a month's time (July 30).  27 . I can't believe a quarter of my life has flown by so fast. It's been a wonderful 26 years really. I've been through so many heartaches, hardship and troubles, but I've had my share of laughter, success and celebrations. Life is good. Life is always good.   This brings to mind another question: If you didn't know how old you were, how old do you think you'd be?

      In my humble opinion:  Dulcinea's Churros are way better than Max Brenner's Churros. Then again, maybe that's because I'm not a chocolate person. I also like the Dulcinea ones because they're long and fat, more for my money.  Wendy's Frosty is best partnered with french fries. The mix of a hot salty french fry and the cool semi-frozen Frosty in your mouth is sheer indulgence.  Dunkin Donuts' Strawberry-Filled is still the best. Never mind if I get a random air-filled one. It still tastes better than any other strawberry-filled donut I've tasted.  A healthy relationship with your boss is critical in your career. I'm really happy that my boss isn't just a colleague but a dear, dear, dear friend to me and H. Our one-on-one meetings that are scheduled for 1 hour extend up to 4 hours sometimes because of major girl talk. I do love her as a boss and a friend.  Drinking 2 liters of water a day is healthy. Even if I have to walk to the loo every hour on the hour, that's okay. Get a 1 liter thermos and make sure you fill it twice daily. It makes it easier to track how much you've taken already.  Happy weekend bloggers!

      A colleague and I were talking about his children, and I brought up the subject of educational plans. H & I have considered getting such a plan, even if we don't have children yet. My colleague said it's a big help -- his daughter's yearly tuition is P90,000, and P70,000 of that is care of the plan. I didn't ask how much he paid for the whole plan (I thought it was too personal a question), but he strongly recommended that I get one for my future kids. After much talk about the expenses of raising a child, my heart wanted to scream out loud, "Enough! Enough!" That's 90 freaking thousand for a fourth-grader. Woah. By the time I have a kid and she becomes a fourth-grader, who knows what inflation would've done to that tuition? Yikes.  How do you manage your children's school fees? Do you have an educational plan? Or do you plan on getting one? I am now seeking tips as I am totally clueless when it comes to this. I have an ever-ready insurance agent, but I'd like to get opinions from different people before getting in touch with her.  Tips on this will be highly appreciated. :)

      I am a peanut butter lover. More specifically, I am a  crunchy  peanut butter lover. I put peanut butter on everything. I had it for breakfast just now, along with some sweet apples. Note how I said I had peanut butter WITH apples, not apples with peanut butter. That's an entirely different thing. After I finished the apples, I ate about two teaspoonfuls of peanut butter. Oh, heaven.  My hunt for the best crunchy peanut butter is over. This peanut butter has so many nuts, is not too oily, not too creamy... it's just right.  And the award goes to  urlLink Peter Pan !   *Oscars music plays*  And now... my late Friday Five, taken from  urlLink Tin :  1. If the world were to suddenly end right now, what do you wish you would have done?  I wish I could've gone to Disneyworld and Universal Studios with my husband. That's our dream vacation.    2. How many times do you hit the snooze button before getting out of bed?  Three times. If I hit it more than 3x, I wake up an hour late. Yow.   3. What cartoon do you enjoy watching from the present (or the past)?  Jimmy Neutron. The Fairy Oddparents. As Told by Ginger. When I was a kid, I loved Beverly Hills Teens, Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake, Shirt Tales, Rainbow Brite, Gummi Bears, and oh, so much more.   4. If you could go to any time and/or place in history, where/when would it be?  Sixties. Flower power!   5. If your life were a movie, what would it be rated and why?  R-18. Nothing too radical, but it's not for the naive.

       urlLink Tet  had an incredible entry on Mark Macapagal's piece called  urlLink Doing the Little Things . In a nutshell, he talks about the value of little gifts in a relationship: listening attentively, for example. I share in his sentiment that though the grand things in life will always be well-appreciated, it's those little things that can make or break a relationship -- sticking it out when the going gets rough, being extremely patient, being there by just being a listener. I've always believed that the ordinary can be extraordinary, that the simple can be sweet.  Every night, I prepare H's pajamas. I lay them out on the bed, alongside his underwear and his towel. I also prepare our nightly vitamins, placing the whole set (Vit E, C, etc...) in two little containers (his and mine). I hand this to him along with a mug of water to wash the vitamins down. I place a dollop of Close-up on his toothbrush before he prepares for bed. Little things, really. I don't complain when I do them at all. I've gotten used to doing these, think nothing much of it, and assumed that it meant as much to him as it did to me -- a nightly ritual of love and care. Turns out it was more than that to him. He told me that he loves telling his friends about how I take care of him, how I watch over him with even the littlest details. I didn't know he noticed every little thing I did for him. It made me really happy.  Think about the last time you did something special for your hubby, your loved ones. Now think about the last time you did something 'little' that you didn't think would generate such large results. Gifts don't have to be grand. Sometimes, the warmest embrace or the sweetest kiss or pajamas prepared nightly are the grandest gifts you can give someone.

      Donâ€™t use stainless spoons on stainless pans â€“ the scraping can release harmful chemicals and toxins that are harmful to your health. For constant friction, use wooden spoons.  Got a wonderful pedicure over lunch. Going to the salon always makes me feel better. My toenails are now painted a frosted tangerine/beige-ish color. I usually have them painted in pink or a white sheen. Ta-da, felt a bit more adventurous today hence that almost orange color -- didn't realize that such a pretty color combo would look good on my toenails. Yey!  And oh... I got promoted yesterday. I couldn't stop grinning and giving my thanks to God for this great blessing. Over the past few weeks, I've been pretty down in the dumps career-wise -- I'll spare you the details. This will finally give my spirit a boost. Salamat, God. Thank you, God. Life is so full of surprises.

      First up: Could you  urlLink indulge me here  please? :)  Second: Lesson learned.  Don't be afraid to ask. Last weekend when buying ingredients for the crab and corn soup, my spirits deflated when I couldn't find any coriander in the grocery. Total bummer since I love coriander. I was walking through the other aisles getting other ingredients when I saw a lady with coriander in her cart. WHAT?! I had already searched the whole veggies section and didn't find a single bunch labeled coriander! I went back to the veggies and looked for it again. Lucky for me there was a staff member there.   "Sir, meron po kayong coriander?" (Sir, do you have any coriander?) "Meron po. Ayan po sa dulo." (Yes, ma'am. It's at the end of this row." "Mmmm....'Wansoy'? Coriander po yun?" (Wansoy? That's coriander?) "Oo." (Yes.) "Aaaah. Salamat." (Thanks.)  Geez. Me and my limited Pinoy vocabulary. So ayan. Wansoy = coriander.  Third: Major menstrual cramps. What do you do? I just let it pass. Iâ€™m not a pill popper. Some remedies people have shared with me: Cerveza Negra (Tried it, helped only a wee bit), Orgasm (Ha-ha), Midol (Ainâ€™t a pill popper), Hot water bag (Donâ€™t have one here at work). I usually take a sick leave on Day 1 because thatâ€™s when itâ€™s most painful. (cringes in pain at her work desk). Help me, help me!

      Had a blast with the family yesterday. To make the day extra special, I offered to prepare lunch. Me cook? Yowza! Not a very common thing to see! But I've been wanting to try this recipe since I got back from that cooking workshop of 2 weeks back. This is what I prepared: Crab and Corn Soup and Grilled Porkchops. C'est magnifique!    Crab and Corn Soup    Yield: approx. 10 servings    Ingredients:  Fish Stock Asian (or Chicken Broth), 1.3 ltr Ginger, fresh, sliced, 5 gr Coriander, fresh, chopped, 5 gr Corn, creamed, sweet, 400 gr Corn flour, approx 20 gr Water to dissolve corn flour, 80 ml Crab meat cooked shredded, 200 gr Sesame oil, 10 ml Soya sauce, 10 ml Pepper white ground, 2 gr Eggs whole, 4-5 pcs Spring onions sliced, 10 gr Fresh coriander, 10 gr   Preparation:  1. Add sliced ginger and fresh chopped coriander to the prepared stock, bring to a boil. 2. Add the creamed corn and shredded crab meat. 3. Thicken with corn flour (Maizena) dissolved in water, simmer for 2-3 minutes. 4. Add sesame oil, soya sauce, season with white pepper. 5. Stir in the eggs slightly mixed. 6. Garnish with spring onions and coriander.    Grilled Pork Chops     Ingredients:  Pork chops (Quantity depends on how many are dining) Salt   Preparation:  Rub salt on each side of the meat. Put the meat on a broiler pan or rack and set it on the highest oven shelf (approx 4" away from the heat). Broil/grill for 10-15 minutes on each side until golden brown.  It took me around 30 to 40 minutes to prepare and cook everything. Not bad at all. It would've been faster if there was less chitchat, but that's what makes cooking fun too!  My picky sisters gobbled it all up. Ah, success. My Mom asked for the recipe. H was extremely proud (and full)! He kept saying, "Marunong na magluto Wifey ko!" (My Wifey already knows how to cook!) Dad ate the leftover soup because he was late for lunch.   For dessert, we had Chocopeanut Ice cream. Nah, I didn't make it myself. No ice cream maker, remember? H and I just bought half a gallon from the nearby grocery. It was still a great way to end lunch!  I shared a recipe for Shrimp and Mango Salad with my Mom and youngest sister later in the day. Mom goes, "That's what you're making next time you visit!" Not a problem. I'm starting to get more comfortable in the kitchen and I feel the kitchen warming up to me.  At last!

      My cute niece Isabella. Adorable!               I had an entry last month about  urlLink missing hanging out with my girlfriends.  I guess God heard me, because a couple of days after that entry, I got together with some close friends from college. In spite of our busy schedules, we managed to get together and do a really girly thing... we saw Dirty Dancing 2 (Havana Nights). Heehee. A couple of weeks after that, I hung out with  urlLink my other group of girlfriends  from my old ad agency. We wined, dined and behaved like very good bad girls. Yesterday, I had a great lunch with a  urlLink friend  I met online way back in '98. We meet at least once a year (not counting chance encounters). It's been great catching up with friends and forming pacts to have lunch again in the next month, in the next year. This weekend, even though I know the trip is gonna tire me, I'm going to visit the group of girlfriends closest to my heart -- my Mom and my two younger sisters. I can't wait. Though we keep in touch through text messaging and many phone calls, it's still a big difference when you're actually hanging out with them of course. I miss them.  Daddy sent me a text message out of the blue last night: "How r u toni, i luv u." Awww. I love my Dad.  I've gotten hooked on Jollibee's Sausage Sandwich (with Egg). Bad, bad girl. I've eaten it for 2 breakfasts in a row. I better not make it three. I don't want to put on extra weight.  TGIF! I can't wait for this day to be over. I just want to hang out with H and then visit my family.  And here's today's tip: Set your ref at 5 degrees Celsius. This is when bacteria sleeps. Higher than that can cause bacteria to wake up and procreate. But from experience: I set our ref at 5 degrees Celsius as soon as I got back from our cooking workshop. After a couple of hours, my bananas froze. Ho-hum. Instant banana popsicles with sleeping bacteria. Doesn't sound too bad at all.  Note, 2:02 PM: My aunt just emailed me:  hi  toni girl.. when your bananas freeze just put one in a blender,  add a cup of  non-fat or low fat milk (depends on the size of the banana) for a healthy smoothie.  i freeze my ripe bananas on purpose.  Now why didn't I think of that?

      Donâ€™t use wooden cutting boards. Cutting into the wood opens up its pores. This is a trap for bacteria (salmonella, streptococculoccus ek ek ekâ€¦), especially if you use it to chop raw (worse, bloody) meat. The meat's blood and raw pieces can seep into the wood and contaminate the other food you'll be chopping.   It is best to use plastic chopping boards. In fact, try to keep several chopping boards in the kitchen and color code them. Red is for meat, white is for vegetables. This is more hygienic.  Another reason why you shouldnâ€™t use wooden cutting boards is that you can get splinters in your food. Instant toothpick that you might swallow accidentally. Ouch.

      Do you have a theme song, like Ally McBeal? The type of song you sing over and over in your head to make you feel better, to put a bounce in your step, to get you back on track? I don't. I do have a mantra though, and it's worked for me.    Warrior's stance, shield and lance. The grace and the charm of a maiden.   I say that over and over in my head when I'm faced with a difficult situation. I've used that for a job interview, for a difficult presentation, even just plain walking down a street. I find that I start walking with my chin up and shoulders back. I feel strong and feminine at the same time.  I made that mantra up. I combined strength and grace in a mantra because that's what I usually need. I feel more powerful after that.  Try it yourself. Think of one, two or three things that will make you feel more powerful, or if you want it the other way, that will make you feel at peace. They can be one and the same, or you can have different mantras for different moods of yours. I like mine because I can apply it to any situation.   Feel free to use my mantra. I wanted to share it with you. Grrrl power rules.  All together now, ommmmmm.....

      I'm turning 27 tomorrow. Do&nbsp;I feel my age? The truth is I feel older than 27. I feel I'm 30. I think it's because I got tired of the craziness of youth early on and embraced the adult life immediately. I've gotten over my workaholic phase a long time ago. I've established a routine to keep my little household running well. I've gotten into the groove of my job. I've been managing my finances pretty fairly. However, I still have a lot to learn as I am far from mastering these things. I get tired just thinking of all the things I have yet to accomplish. Does one ever stop growing up?   My birthday wish is for me to have fun and relax. I wish that I can take hold of myself and strengthen my childlike wonder. I wish that I could lessen my being a worrywart. I wish that I could get to see life outside office windows and experience walking along the seashore once again. More than that, I wish that people around me would let go of their worldly cares and dance with the wind. It's no fun celebrating life by myself.   So as I blow out the 27 candles on my birthday cake, I hope that I am not the only one wishing for all these to come true. I hope that you'll blow out the candles along with me, so we can all experience this one big wish -- to celebrate love, wonder, happiness, friendship, family, marriage, freedom, serenity and life  together . =)

      "Kailangan kasi ang katawan sinasanay. Kung maaga ka nagigising, edi makakaiwas ka sa trapik. Kung uma-umaga eh alas-kwatro ang gising mo, alas singko nasa daan, mild lang ang trapik non. Wala kang rason ma-late. Dapat ganong lang, sanayan. Kahit walang pasok, magigising ka ng alas-kwatro, tingnan mo. Tapos maiisip mo na, ay Sabado pala, tulog pa ako. O diba ang sarap 'non?"*  Words of wisdom from yet another cab driver. As usual, the city traffic was heavy and I went about my usual staring off into space mode. Then I remembered a line from  urlLink the book I was reading last night , "Strangers are just family you have yet to know." I'll give this a try. After small talk with the driver about the terrible jam, I asked a question that's a sure-fire way to have a conversation with any cab driver, "Saan po kayo naka-garahe?" (Where's your taxi based?) And so we talked for the whole ride -- well, he talked and I listened. And that quote up there was one of the things I learned from him. I felt a bit guilty because that is so true for me. I keep indulging myself with "5 more minutes" and I hit the snooze button again and again. I do get more sleep but I end up in heavier traffic. What a headache. And so his advice was very timely.  I will try to make getting up at 5 am part of my 21-day-habit-building activity.   * Translation: "Your body needs to get used to it. If you wake up early, you'll avoid traffic. If you wake up everyday at 4 a.m., you'll be on the road at 5 a.m. with only mild traffic. You won't have any reason to be late. It's a matter of habit. Even when there's no work, you'll find yourself waking up at 4 a.m., you'll see! Then you'd think, oh it's a Saturday, I'll sleep some more. Isn't that good?"

       Cinderella, Cinderella  H & I swept and&nbsp;scrubbed almost the whole day yesterday. To keep our spirits up, we put on some music. Who can beat the  urlLink music from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy ? I love "All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)" and "You Promised Me." Playing upbeat music while doing household chores helps lighten the load and liven the mood.&nbsp;We played the CD three times in a row. I really think the music helped because before we knew it, the afternoon had passed us by. Now our place is cleaner and much more organized. At last!   Wishing Upon A Star Works  In other news, I finally got to scratch some items off my wish list. *dances for joy*   urlLink  One Question   And in more news, I've started a new blogging community&nbsp;I lifted the idea from its  urlLink livejournal counterpart . I started the LJ one early this year, and the responses to the community have been really interesting. To widen the circle, I've decided to bring this to Blogger. Check  urlLink one question  out sometime to learn more about it. If you want to be a member (so you can post questions), just send an e-mail my way

       urlLink Tet  requested for some tips on losing weight. Hmmm. The best tip is still to exercise regularly and eat right! Here's a little something on that "eat right" bit. My Mom, my sisters and I used to devour this soup.  urlLink It's part of a 7-day diet . The question is, did we lose weight? I think I did. I felt lighter after that diet phase. My Mom lost weight significantly! It was amazing. They say that this soup contains "almost no calories." So the more you eat, the more you burn. YOU be the judge. And hey, consult your doctor first if you can take this soup!   We eventually ended up taking the soup even if we weren't on the 7-day diet. If you're a vegetable lover like me, oh yum, this one's for you.&nbsp;I found it really delicious. I would eat it alongside my regular viand and rice meal.    urlLink Here's the recipe &nbsp;and the 7-day diet.&nbsp;We had to make some adjustments to the recipe and the soup was still delicious. For example, we used Knorr Chicken Cube bouillon instead of a vegetable bouillon. No seaweed. No spices. No hot pepper.   The same yummy fat-free soup!

      What tip can I offer today? Well, based on what I learned from this survey, it's to be optimistic and hang in there. Life isn't all that bad, even if at a certain point in your life you feel like everything's crumbling around you. In God's graces, things will work out for you. Life has a lot of good surprises in store for us. As long as you keep that positive attitude, you'll be okay.    &nbsp;   10 Years Ago, I...   1. Still lived in my parentsâ€™ home.  2. Wanted to get a job in Finance.  3. Had a sort-of crush on my male best friend.    5 Years Ago, I...   1. Thought Iâ€™d never get married.  2. Was a workaholic.  3. Partied every night.    3 Years Ago, I...   1. Didnâ€™t have a boyfriend.  2. Was a lot thinner than I am now!!!  3. Partied every other night.    A Year Ago, I...   1. Learned how to operate a mini-gas stove.  2. Cooked Sinigang na Hipon for the very first time. 3. Started  Wifely Steps.  (Happy 1st year anniversary!)   This Year, I...   1. Cleaned the bathroom for the first time.  2. Made a kick-ass Crab &amp; Corn soup.  3. Became most conscious about budgeting household expenses.  &nbsp;   Yesterday, I...   1. Amused myself with lessons from "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."  2. Learned that the 21-day habit thing is working for my making-the-bed-as-soon-as-I-get-out-of-it-chore.  3. Had Spicy Tuyo, Fried Egg, Achara and Rice for dinner.    Today, I...   1. Tried The Grindâ€™s "Fitness Groove" and found the workout a bit boring.  2. Worked too hard.  3.

      So what's the difference between sheets that are 50% polyester/50% cotton and 30% polyester/70% cotton? The latter may be of a softer texture but is prone to "himulmol." (I think that translates to  urlLink pilling  in English.) Since H has allergies to those little things, we thought it best to go with the 50/50. Our friendly SM saleslady also said that the 30/70 make is prone to have more wrinkles ("Gusutin," she said). Hey, who wants wrinkles? And so we got a wonderful geometric blue and white fitted sheet, two pillowcases and a flat sheet. I was expecting it to be a bit rough to the touch but it wasn't so bad after all.  &nbsp;  In other news, I picked out my [advanced] birthday gift from H yesterday. Yipee! I got a 5 1/2 ft. tall walnut bookshelf. Oooh, I can't wait to place all my books there. I can scratch this item off my wish list. :D  &nbsp;  Have a great week everyone! And I have a tagboard now, by the way. :D

      I have been trying to get back in shape. I started my aerobic workouts this week. I can't believe that after only three mornings of exercising, I feel so much better about myself. I really hope I maintain this motivation to make myself healthier!  &nbsp;  I have tried going to several gyms in the past, but over the years I have come to realize that I work out better when I'm on my own. I get bored with equipment. I feel uncomfortable with too many people around me. This is a cliche, but my biggest competitor is my own self. I can pump my arms faster, stomp harder, jump higher when I work out on my own. It also comes with the fact that I don't worry about looking like a fool to other people, that's why I give it my all.  &nbsp;  I have pretty old VCD copies of MTV's The Grind workout. They are so much fun! I love it because of the dancing. They take the usual aerobic steps and twist them into hip, dynamic ways of dancing. I have other favorites - Karen Voight, Denise Austin, someonewhosenameIforgot, Billy Blanks' Taebo, but I find myself going back to The Grind, just because they're just more fun.  &nbsp;  To stay in or get back in shape, search for a form of exercise that will continually motivate you. Try to find out what workout works best for you and your personality. This will make getting out of bed easier for you, and hopefully, give you a healthier glow before you even know it!&nbsp;      urlLink  Follow-up questions:     urlLink  catsudon     asked,&nbsp; "Who was your Philosophy 101/102 teacher?"  My answer is Mr. Mike Mariano.    urlLink  Lissa    says,  "Sana magkita tayo one day ulit, 'no?" (I hope we see each other someday again!)  To which I say, Lissa, I really think we will see each other someday. :)

      Thanks to all those who indulged me in  urlLink my last entry.  I have to admit that I had a lot of fun! Why don't you guys try the Q&A thing on your blogs?    urlLink Linnor ,  urlLink tiptoes  &  urlLink Mitch  asked:   Where do you work and where did you study?  I work in an advertising agency based in Makati. I studied in Ateneo de Manila University. One big fight! :)   urlLink Junnie  asked several Ms. Universe questions:  1. What is the essence of a true woman?  Though Sushmita Sen said that the essence of a true woman is to be a mother, I disagree. Not everyone is meant to be one, after all. I answer this question with a character from the Dragonlance series: Laurana, the Golden General. She was the epitome of true beauty and was raised a very sheltered princess. Following the whispers of her heart, she broke through this stereotype and used her intelligence, strength, compassion to lead her people to victory against the Knights of Takhisis. A true woman does not take things sitting down. She is not submissive. She does not permit herself to be boxed in. I believe that a true woman acknowledges her passions and wholeheartedly pursues them. She does not permit femininity to be a disadvantage, but just like Laurana, turns her subtle strength into an advantage. This is what I strongly believe to be the essence of a true woman. I thank you. Mabuhay Philippines! [Bow!]  2. Should a wife be left doing the household work even if she is working herself?  No. I believe that marriage is a partnership so that means managing finances together, taking care of the kids together, working on the household chores together.  3. What is your measure of a wife's success? Healthy kids or loving husband. choose only one.  Thank you, Judge Number 1. I will go with Loving Husband. I believe in the quote â€˜The best gift a husband can give his wife is to show how much he loves her in front of their children.â€™ To have a loving relationship with my husband would help my children learn the values of trust, honesty and respect between two people, and where better place to start learning those values than at home? Who better to teach them these values but their parents? I thank you.    urlLink Ruth  asked:  â€œWhat makes you frustrated? Furious? Envious? Jealous? Act negatively? Your failures?â€   urlLink CG  asked:  â€What sets you off?â€  Whenever Iâ€™m about to burst with anger, H would say, â€œUh-oh, here comes the Wifey Monsterâ€¦â€ And so I turn into a Wifey Monster because of the following things: Plans that do not push through. When I cancel on someone. Working with idiots. Telemarketers â€“ I truly believe this service is a nuisance. When I set my heart on something and I canâ€™t seem to get it no matter what I do. Fat days. A messy bathroom. Highly inconsiderate people (for example, those who play very loud heavy metal music for all the employees to hear in the middle of a busy workday). Running out of money. Getting my feet wet accidentally when I walk on a street after a rainy day. Slow computers. As for my failures, I hate it that I wasnâ€™t able to finish my Masterâ€™s. Oh well, someday I will.    urlLink 233  asked:   If life on earth would have been over tomorrow,  1) What would be your utmost regret?  That I didnâ€™t get the chance to be a mother.  2) What would be your prime consolation?  That I did get a semi-experience in raising children through my kid cousins, niece and to some extent, my husband. Hehe.   urlLink Justice  asked:  1) What are your fave dishes?  I love Sinigang na Baboy. Tuyo. Adobong Manok. Tortang Talong. Inihaw na Tilapia. Galunggong. Angel hair pasta with tomato sauce. Tawilis. Shakeyâ€™s Garlic & Cheese Pizza with extra anchovies and pineapples. Iâ€™m getting hungry.  2) Do you have insecurities?  Oh yes. I donâ€™t like how my body looks. I think Iâ€™m really fat. Itâ€™s all in the mind though, but still, my weight makes me feel insecure.  3) (same as R's question) What makes you furious?  So many things. See my answers to her questions!  4) What's your best asset? (terms of character ha?)  I am very compassionate.   5) Where in manila do you come from?  Mabuhay Philippines! My name is Toni and Iâ€™m from Quezon Cityyyyyy!   urlLink Tin  asked:  What are your views on homosexuality?  I support the decisions these people make about their sexuality. I do not look at them any differently. I highly respect them for having the courage to come out and not feel that their sexuality is a trap or a handicap.    urlLink Pie  asked:   1. Do you prefer English or Tagalog?  I prefer English. I was raised speaking English. I think in English. I believe that the Filipino language is very beautiful, however I donâ€™t speak it well enough.  2. Have you ever been to the states?  Yes I have been to the States! I have relatives all over. I am looking forward to going back there sometime.  3. From what I understand the gap between the Filipino upper and lower classes is massive. Being on the upper end of that, how does that make you feel about living there?  Simple. I honestly fear for my security everyday. Itâ€™s something I have come to cope with. I wonâ€™t discuss poverty. I wonâ€™t discuss how the upper class can also deter my security. I wonâ€™t go into the crimes that happen daily. This isnâ€™t the place for that. But really pie, I do fear for the safety of everyone, most especially that of my loved onesâ€™.   urlLink Carmela  asked:  What is the most endearing thing you've done for your husband?  For his birthday last year, I collected notes and pictures from his friends and family from all over the world. I put them all in one scrapbook and added some artistic touches. He wasnâ€™t expecting it at all. He was so touched!   urlLink Jeanny  asked:  1. Whatâ€™s your real name, as in your first and last name?  Just call me Toni. For security reasons, we donâ€™t want to post our full names now, do we? = )   2. What are your fave book/s?  Veronika Decides to Die. The Alchemist. The Valkyries. The Dragonlance Chronicles. The Trouble with Thirteen. Good in Bed. In Her Shoes. The DaVinci Code. By The River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept.  3. Who was the last person that made you cry?  Peter Parker. I cried during one of the scenes in Spiderman.  4. Lastly, what is the best part of being a wifey?  Being together forever with my Husby.   urlLink Yupki  asked:  1. What are your guilty pleasures?  Getting a full body massage, a body scrub, pedicure and manicure. Buying tons of books. Eating ice cream. Eating Pringles (original flavor) and washing it down with ice-cold Coca-Cola.   2. Famous person (living or dead) you'd like to meet?  OPRAH WINFREY! I just want to give her a hug.  3. What do you do when something angers you?  I visualize ripping his/her hair out and snapping back, but thatâ€™s as far as I go. I usually keep quiet for awhile to collect all my thoughts. And then I answer back with stern words. Very stern words.

      Don't you find it amusing when people think that who you are in your blog is who you are in real life? I don't think this blog even captures 50% of who I really am! Sometimes we think we know each other so well because of what we read from each other's blogs -- but as  urlLink dieselnights  said, "We don't really know them, we just know what they want us to know."   And so, I'd like you to ask me something you want to (or should?) know about me. It could be something obvious, or it could be something you have no idea about. I won't bite so go ahead! Ask me a question. :)

        "Let us not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless when facing them." - Rabindranath Tagore    Isn't that such a beautiful quote? It applies to the smallest challenge to the biggest obstacle one might face. And so this weekend, I tried living that quote out. I got my butt off the couch -- a big Sunday achievement!   Cubao Tripping.  Instead of the usual resting we do on a Sunday, H and I got off our butts and rode the MRT to Cubao. We visited Farmer's Plaza. I was surprised that it has developed really well. A year ago, it was had a pretty chaotic layout and quite a rowdy crowd, but this time, it was surprisingly peaceful. We walked around, checking out the new stores and the families doing their Sunday malling.    4th floor, Bargain Books.  National Bookstore, Cubao, has a huge floor full of bargain books. It was my first time there and I was overwhelmed by the number of books! (I was also overwhelmed by the smell of used books, but oh well.) I didn't buy anything, but I did enjoy going through each aisle. I'll go back there someday and hoard children's books (I collect' em).   Remember Fiesta Carnival?  After that short trip to the mall, we found ourselves in a lot where a Ferris Wheel stood. A few steps forward and we saw a Caterpillar and a couple more rides. Where were we?! It took awhile before we understood it -- we were standing in the middle of Fiesta Carnival. We were saddened by this move. I remember Fiesta Carnival being INSIDE a really big building with a super high ceiling and food carts all around. They were moved out recently, and are now settled in what was once a huge parking lot. It was quite sad. H and I went to the Shooting Range for some fun. The sun was blaring hot though, so we had to drop our guns and seek refuge in the nearest mall.   Beat the heat!  We then trooped to the SM Food Court to get hotdogs and sodas. I really like A&W's Coney Dog and Rootbeer Float. Mmmmm. So we just sat there, laughing about our Sunday adventure, sipping on our ice cold drinks and just let ourselves cool off.  We didn't really plan on this field trip of sorts. It was very much spur of the moment. Being one who likes everything planned, I found it hard to say yes to what H proposed, but decided to go for it anyway. I remembered the quote and so I put on my rubber shoes and said, Okay! Let's go!  Face your  katamaran  (laziness). Face your boring routines. Be fearless when doing so! Be open to having an adventure, even if it's just as near as Cubao. Who knows? Today Cubao, tomorrow  urlLink Barcelona!

      A hotdog sandwich, popcorn and a large-sized soda is the best movie food combo for me. I can hold my hotdog sandwich in my right hand, put the tumbler on my lap and eat popcorn with my left hand, and when I get thirsty, just reach for my drink with my left hand. Ah yes, I've mastered the art of eating in a moviehouse.  Yesterday, I saw  urlLink Mean Girls  with my fellow not-so-mean girls. It was a fun movie. Did Lindsay Lohan get a boob job? Or is it just puberty that made her get such big breasts (like what Britney says about hers)? It's another one of those high school life, high school cliques stories. You know the drill: a new girl enters high school, she feels out of place, she finds friends who are as "weird" as she is, the hottest clique likes her, so she joins that clique, conflicts develop, she's back all alone, etcetera etcetera. No matter how predictable it was, I had fun watching that movie.  After work, I wanted to see another chick flick because I was on a "girly film high." And so my girl friend B and I decided to catch the grammatically incorrect  urlLink "The Prince & Me."  It was a disaster. I was squirming in my seat halfway through the film. It was a wonder why we both didn't walk out. Maybe because I wanted my money's worth? And the Prince wasn't even cute!   So if you're on a chick flick rampage, catch Mean Girls, drop The Prince and Me. Aw shucks, we should've just seen an art film instead.

      I love flowers. I especially love daisies, gerberas and sunflowers. I find that gazing at flowers is therapeutic for me. I can get lost in their vibrant colors, the smooth skin of their petals, their garden fresh scent.   Try bringing flowers into your home. It'll help a room come alive and feel more homey. Always have a fresh vase of flowers when a guest comes over. It's a sign of sincerely welcoming your guest. If you have a yard, try turning even one corner into a garden of greens and bright colors. It will definitely cheer your yard up!  Here are some pictures of my Dad's garden blossoms. I wish I had inherited his green thumb!

      H and I have a weekly movie date. It's a regular schedule I look forward to every week. Greenbelt 3 is our favorite movie date place because of the well-behaved crowd (no ringing cell phones in the middle of a movie),  urlLink Chimara  - where I get my favorite low-cholesterol & still delicious popcorn,  urlLink Sureseats  - I'm able to reserve my tickets online, Timezone - where we play before and after a movie. During weekends or on not-so-late week nights, we watch a DVD in our condo. Here are a list of our recent favorites we'd like to share with you. Hopefully you can still catch them at the local cinema, if not, go rent a copy from your local video store!   urlLink  Beautiful Boxer  . This is a true story based on Thailand's famous transvestite boxer. Nong Toom believed that she was a woman trapped in a man's body. She kickboxed her way to fame and fortune so she could reach her 'ultimate goal of femininity'. It's a "Triumph of the Human Spirit" kind of film with a twist. To quote a line from the film that struck me: "The hardest thing is trying not to forget who you want to be." A lot will surely sympathize with Nong Toom as we too have whispers deep within our hearts that we listen to and want to be at peace with. If you're in Manila, do try to catch it at  urlLink Cinemanila.  (As a bonus, H & I got to meet and shake hands with the director last night. How cool is that! And on a girly note, check out the guy named Nat, Nong Toom's friend. He's a cutie!!!)    urlLink Spider-man 2  . I dare not write a synopsis of this film as everyone knows about this anyway. All I can say is, it's better than the first, Tobey's extra cute, there's a part where he spoofs the back pains that were supposed to keep him from filming this sequel, I wonder why they didn't pursue the Aunt May/Doc Ock romance, and it's a movie that kept me at the edge of my seat with my hand doing a rhythmic up and down motion from the popcorn tumbler to my mouth. I LOVED IT! Hmmm. That was a mouthful.    urlLink Azumi  . If you like samurai flicks, this is a must-see. It's about a young, beautiful heroine trained since childhood to serve as the ultimate assassin. It's a bloody film, but you won't care for the blood one bit because of the beautiful Azumi and her swift, flowing and very graceful samurai moves. This has grrrl power written all over it -- in blood no less.    urlLink Drumline  . If you like drums, you HAVE to see this. Devon Miles is a young, super-talented drummer who earns a music scholarship to Atlanta A and T university, hoping to land a spot in the uni's renowned marching band's drumline. Miles is a headstrong character though, wanting to beat to the sound of his own drum, breaking away from the sound of the whole band. It's a pretty predictable film, especially with the romance factor in, but the fantastic drumline showdowns make up for its predictability. I should look into getting the film's official soundtrack.    urlLink Sleepless in Seattle  . Okay, so this isn't a recent fave, but I saw it on cable recently so it's here in my list. This has been my favorite movie ever since it was shown in '93. If you haven't seen this, shame, shame, shame! (Kidding!) Anyway, the tagline says it all: "What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only someone for you?" And of course, my favorite line in the film: "I knew it the very first time I touched her. It was like coming home... only to no home I'd ever known... I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car and I knew. It was like... magic." Aaah, yes. This is a movie that will keep you holding hands with your date all throughout.  That's it. Get your popcorn out! Enjoy the movies!

      I don't converse with taxi drivers. Whenever they would try to start a conversation with me, it's either a political issue or a religious issue. I consider politics and religion two very touchy subjects. And so while the driver complains about the increase in gasoline prices or FPJ losing the presidential race, I just nod my head, give him sympathetic looks but absorb everything he's saying. As one who studies consumer research, it's highly important for me to be observant of these things.  It's also difficult to engage in a discussion with the driver, as my opinion is most of the time poles apart from his. It was especially hard during the election fever. I would just bite my lip and listen to the driver campaign for FPJ. Though I wanted to do my part in convincing him that their were better presidential bets, I just kept my mouth zipped. After all, my life was in the hands of this stranger driving the car.   This morning was no different. The taxi driver complained about the fare reduction in the other regions of the country, complained about how the jeepneys had it going great for them. I listened to him intently as a researcher. But there was one more thing he said that struck not my brain anymore, but my heart:  "Kaya nga ako, nagpapasalamat na ako na wala akong sakit. Kahit na maraming problema diyan, basta walang sakit, masaya na ako. Basta nakakakain ng tatlong beses isang araw, nakakapamasahe, basta walang sakit. Pinapasadiyos ko nalang."*  I looked at him and wondered if he was an angel in some way. It was as if he was telling me exactly what I needed to here. I myself have been pretty preoccupied with problems such as budgetting, our furniture, my yoyo-ing weight... but when he said those words, I felt my heart ache with a bit of shame and optimism at the same time. Here was a man who had not lost hope. Here was a man who strived hard everyday. Here was a man who was thankful for things we normally take for granted.   He was right. I said a silent prayer, asking God to bless this man and his day. I thanked God for sending this particular driver to me on a dreary Thursday morning.   Mr. Taxi Driver, wherever you are, thank you for reminding me about the little things I have forgotten. Thank you for reminding me that things aren't all that bad. You've touched my life, and you don't even know it.   * Translation: "I'm really thankful I'm not sick. Even if there are a lot of problems, as long as I'm healthy, I'm happy. As long as I get to eat three meals a day, am able to work, as long as I don't get sick. I leave it all up to God."

        I honestly don't remember when I learned how to play  urlLink mahjong . I do remember that it is an informal rite to adulthood in our family. I started with putting the bricks together to form a pyramid, a house or stack them next to each other caterpillar-style to create a domino effect. I think it was around sixth grade when my cousins and I started observing our aunts and grandparents "wash the tiles" and shout out "Bunot," "Todas," "Todo chow," and many more. We wondered why they could play till the wee hours of the morning.  When we tried our little hands at the game, the next generation of mahjong players was born. When we each experienced our first win and shouted out "Todas!!!!" it was as if we were welcomed into a circle only grownups could belong to. It was as if we were given badges that said "I am no longer a kid." Though we each had an aunt or an uncle coaching us from behind our seats, we felt like adults. From then on, parties would have two mahjong tables: one for the oldies, one for the newbies (and a circle of chairs for our coaches). The stakes at the oldies' table were much higher and my cousins and I weren't ready for that. Our little newbie stakes would have to do.  Mahjong. I owe a lot of my family bonding to this game. My cousins and I would talk about life and love over Kangs and Chows. With time we got better (and older), and so our aunts and uncles would join in the game. The game bridged generations. Maymee (my maternal grandmother) took pride in playing the game with her grandchildren. She would never lose on purpose, and since she's a REALLY good player, we grandkids were challenged even more. It was her way of training us, I guess. In between mahjong tutorials, she would tell us how she and Wowo (my grandfather) met. While she and three of the grandkids played mahjong, the rest of the clan would always be nearby eating turon, maruya and fried kamote, listening intently to her stories.  Our family parties are never complete without mahjong. The game has broken the generation gaps in our families. It has brought in-laws closer. I think this game is one reason why my relatives and I do end up being close to another. Sure, we have our little misunderstandings once in a while, but there's nothing like a good game of mahjong to tie everyone back together.  For as long as there are little ones willing to learn the game, mahjong will live on in our family and continue to glue our clan together.

      I have a lot of reasons why I love what I do for a living. This is just one reason why I love my job: My work is not limited to a computer at my desk -- I get out in the wild, whether city or country, and study how people go about their daily lives.  Last Monday, I had fieldwork in Batangas. The problem was that it had rained the previous evening, so on Monday the ground was soft and muddy. We went through a very rural area -- so rural the houses were kilometers away from each other. To get to each house took extreme effort! We had to climb muddy, slippery hills, cross a makeshift bridge, hold on to the wild flora to keep from slipping deep into the dirt. I was not prepared for this trip at all. I had my heavy boots on that's why I kept sinking into the mud with each step I took. My jeans were soaked with sweat and yes, a lot of mud. We all smelled like muddy pigs by nightfall.  I was exhausted. I am far from being in good shape! I was huffing and puffing for most of the time. It was all worth it though. Each muddy step took us deeper into rural Batangas, and I was amazed at the greenery all around us. The mountains looked like big broccoli flowers (what an analogy). The rice fields were an amazing symmetry of yellow and green. The air was crisp and fresh, a welcome respite from the seemingly compressed city air.  I grew up spending part of my summer vacations in Batangas. I haven't returned to the country since my teen years. The memories of my home province coming alive shielded me from the blaring sun. I enjoyed every minute of the journey, never mind my expensive boots being drenched in mud. I can always buy another pair of boots, I thought, but experiences like these are hard to come by.  Is it the laidback atmosphere that makes people from the province more friendly? We were never short of smiles and greetings from the locals. They offered kind words and helping hands when we all appeared lost. I missed hearing the Batangas punto (accent). I was waiting for someone to say "Ala eh!" but this was a stereotype that didn't emerge that day.  I remembered a day I had spent at my Uncle's home in one Batangas province. My Batangueno relatives told stories like there was no tomorrow and "ala eh's" spiked each sentence. I listened eagerly to their stories while eating spoonfuls of macapuno. On our way home that day, my cousin and I got into a conversation and it was halfway through our talk when we realized we had developed our own Batangueno punto. We had a hoot speaking with the punto but after half an hour or so, it was back to our regular Manila talk.  Back to my Monday Batangas experience. I went home brimming with so many stories and gave H an earful! There was me almost falling into the mud, the breathtaking Batangas scenery, the 5-hour trek without a single drop of water to drink, walking through vast areas of corn reminiscent of Signs or Field of Dreams, successfully crossing a makeshift bridge that made me feel like a Fear Factor champion, the search for residences in the wild that made me feel like I was in the Amazing Race.  My Batangas trip made me realize that going out in the wild is good for my soul. I was walking the muddy trail when I caught sight of those lush mountains. I stopped my trek and said a prayer. I said a prayer as I stared into the rice paddies. I said a prayer when I closed my eyes and felt the fresh breeze kiss my face. I felt so blessed to have witnessed such beautiful creations. I couldn't thank Him enough for these beautiful gifts of nature.  My trip also rekindled my love for travel. I get tickled by the thought of travel when I look at my blogger friends' photographs and read their stories. Batangas was the final nudge. I have to see more of the country, I thought. I have to get out of the city, not for work, but for myself. I've stopped traveling the past years, mostly because of work, but this time, I'm not letting anything stop me from putting on those traveling shoes.  Where to next? I don't know yet. I do know that I will definitely go back to Batangas. I want to eat Batangas bibingka IN Batangas, not here in Manila. I want to feel the crisp Batangas air again. I want to feel my childhood memories envelope me once again. More importantly, I want to share this experience with H and create new memories with him. The mountains, the people, the  urlLink balisong , the barako, the bibingka -- I want to share all these with him. Maybe he'll even have the Batangas punto after spending a weekend there. Now that would make for an interesting experience.

       First things first  Thank you for all the beautiful greetings! You made my birthday even more special. I had a blast reading through all your birthday comments. My deepest gratitude to you all!   Hitting two birthdays with one party  Mama's birthday falls on the 31st, so last Saturday we had a joint celebration with the people closest to our hearts. We had a small gathering at my parents' house with a lot of love going all around! The food was scrumptious, the drinks were overflowing, the music was groovy, the gifts were awesome, the mah jong gamers lasted till late evening, the hugs were everywhere, the laughter was loud and jolly. I wish my relatives in the States could have joined us, but we made up for that with loooooooooooong long-distance calls. I had a super-birthday.   My party tip  Nobody was on a diet on that day. Nobody was allowed to have a diet! We had so much food, each one cooked by family members. The highlight of lunch was  urlLink Charlie's Pritchon . Oh yum yum yum. Think lechon (roasted pig) served peking duck style. Oh yum. The lechon is fried and chopped into biteable pieces, then wrapped in individually sized pita breads with cucumber slivers, then covered with your choice of sauce: hoisin (my favorite), honey lemon, honey mustard, liver, chili tagalog and white garlic. My 9-year-old cousin likes having a combination of sauces in her pritchon. The crunchiness of the pritchon mingles combined with the tangy sauce, juicy cucumber and pita bread is a heavenly feast. Try having Charlie's Pritchon served instead of the usual fried chicken or lechon. The mixing and matching of sauces, plus the new twist to lechon makes for an unforgettable and belly-filling party experience. Dang, I can't wait for the next party.
