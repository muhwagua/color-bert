      Good Morning Folks,  This is my way of just giving you an opportunity of looking at my mindframe everyday. I am not going to e-mail everyday because you all will get sick of me. Well, All is well on the eastern front of my world. I went home yesterday and hung out with my parent and that is always a good thing. My dad is kinda worried because his job is not doing well. Shit, how can Ieven tell him that my job is on it's last legs too. We have a meeting today and who knows what else will happen. I just keep that positive mindset and everything will fall into place.   I stood home last night watching TV and actually got to catch NYPD blue. That is one of the best shows still left on the Boob Tube . Everything comes and goes and it is basically crap. Yet, they tend to keep me as an avid watcher. Nothing else really turned me on last night, not even the porno that I so gratuitously receive. I kinda get sick of porn after a while. Every single woman starts looking and sounding alike after several strokes from a 25 inch wang that double as a can / tripod.   Today is good ol Wednesday and I am taking off Tomorrow and Friday. Tomorrow I am just taking some " Me " time. I wanted to take it on the weekend but I did so much and I want to be left alone. I know that being alone sucks but hey, I like to be alone. I have always been a loner and I know I will die alone.  Ok... On to Poetry news... What can I say... Next Tuesday is Acentos and I will be there with my partner in tow ( or vice versa ). We have an HBO Def Poet in the likeness of Emanuel Xavier. Shit should be off the hook.   All is good  Peace Love Swallow like a fat chic on an Easter Ham  >)))">

      Wow, last night was an interesting slam. That is in my eyes of course. I made it to Bar 13 through a headache that wanted to rip my eyes out of my head and make me swallow the little juice that fills up my eyebals. That is the type of headache that I had last night. I even asked Lenny to go to the store for me and pick up some advils. You know it was bad if I had to ask someone to get me Advils. It was the Hot and cold shit that was killing me yesterday.  Ok, Back to 13. Last night was the Mini showcase, feature, semi-final slam. The showcase was a nice mix of who knows what. My headache was pounding and I barely remembered my name last night. I think I remember Nasdak reading because he had a good bye party so he was kinda the honored guest and all.   I am going to get to the feature beause this girls is beyond incredible. Her name is Maya Azuzena and she was belting out some tunes last night that made people cry. I am not relgious in the least, she had me singing along with her gospel and all. She has a voice and displays it with such a fucking ferocity that it makes hairs stand on end.  The slam cam and went and now some fears are seriously coming into play. This chic Claudia made the finals with her quirky little Poetry and just plain ol weirdness. Shappy made it and I was happy. I love his style and I had fiath in him. What kills me is that his homstead of Urbana failed to get him into the finals. Maybe Shappy should get a Bar 13 homestead. Second place was this Claudia chic. I knew after the second time around the judges were digging her. Not by the scores but by who was judging. That is another story. Marty came in Third and I was happy for her. I admire the hell out of Marty. She is really genuine. The brain that she has in her head is not even right. How can someone have that much knowledge. Some fuckers were discounting Marty for this final but I had faith in her. She did well and I am proud of her.  So, another Monday come and gone from " A little bit Louder urlLink   " mondays. I went home and made my usual White Castle stop. Oscar actually owes me some food that little bastard. I am pretty good the way things are turning out with me. I might have an opportunity to write for a magazine. I am thinking of starting school in September. I am reading poet after poet. Life is really coming together.  Next week is Acentos and I am happy about that. I have put flyers on cars and tonight I am going out to do some more spots. We need to do our thing to get everyone out.   OK, How do I feel today?? well, I am good. I kinda thirsty for more but if I rush it, I will get all fucked up. I am taking my time to get things done on my pace. I just became an Official member of the LouderARTS project and that was kinda weird. I didn't think I had what it took to get in but they thought otherwise. I am still feeling out what is the purpose of this Louder thing. They are all kinda hard to figure out but as always, everything takes time.   So, Today, I will be off to buy a poetry book. I have so many suggestions to take up.   Ok  I love you like a skinny chic loves sticking a finger down her throat to throw up and maintain that anorexic curvy body that strictly resembles a q-tip.  Peace  >)))">

      Well, I am not tryig to make this blog entry all fancy and schmancy. It is just a small thought that jumped headfirst through my arms and hit my fingertips to be released through the keyboard. Thoughts are kinda nutty most of the time. When some one says think before you speak ". They mean the hell out of that!!!!! If I let loose of every thought, I wouldn't have friends, sex, or maybe even a life.  Well, this weekend was excellent. Going backwards, yesterday was a great day in which I hung with the fellas. I also got to see my little god daughter. It was so coool to see her. Then My Man's little son was there and he was a trip. That little kid has to be a comedian in the making.   So, no poetry to be mentioned for the night and we had an awesome time. Talking and bonding and everything else. Life is good.

       White Castle, Good Deed, Influx of nerds   Hello folks, I hope that when you all grace the eyes on your computer screen and you see my blog that you will get immediately horny and give a brotha an offer for a good sexual act. I am broke so any idea of getting paid is out of the question.  Yesterday was a good day. I left my job a little bit late and that threw a wrench into my plans. I like to go home and visit my parents and mess with them for a little while. Funny thing is, I just called my moms while I was writing this and she was in the hospital most of the day with a fucked up case of acid reflux. That shit runs in our family and it is the worst thing in the world. I rather have a heart attack several times over with a buttplug  used as a revival kit. She is ok though. My mother and I have a weird relationship. We have been getting closer over the years but when I was young, I was hating that lady. My pops is just my pops, he is just there and never says anything. He is cool though. I would give him a kidney if I had to.  Back to yesterday, went to White Castle ( I am addicted ). I am just waiting for them motherfuckers at 13 to have another whitie eating contest, I would win that shit hands down. I would predict........ 10 in two mins!!!!! Who dares challenge me?!!!!!! So, I brought me a few and I remembered Shappy's Diary and how he loves Whities. Shappy and I aren't to the point that I ask him about his family but he hasn't given me reason to hate him. So, I did my good deed for the year and brought him 15 white castles as a gift from fellow white castle impressario. He seemed pretty happy with them and I hope he enjoyed them. I put them in the bar and Moonshine was looking at them and I was like, ok, shappy could enjoy about 3 after Moonshine is done. :)  The nerd slam was somewhat decent yesterday. Yet, it was kinda dead. Shappy tried to make the best out of it but he couldn't really pull it off. I still had a good time. Poetry is always good with me. OMX showed up and we pretty much just gigged on this one dude that was " just weird " .  Our evening was capped with a conversation with Cool Breeze, Celena, Shawn Randall. Talked about the blog and made our move away. I wanted to head to Kay's cafe and BEHOLD  We just drove around and spoke about some candid topics last night and it was a good night. We came up with some ideas in which we have to implement to some of our other endeavors ( Acentos , louder, Workshops ).  I have a busy weekend with some meetings, an art gallery opening in the Bronx in which I will read a poem, BBQ, maybe the Nuyo tonight to support Rob Neil.  OK, nothing profound and prophet laden today. Just typical nonsense from me.  Take care  Peace, Love

       Seafood, Porn, Friendship, getting my ass whoooooped in pool   As you read from the title, not everything is really in that order. Last night was a regression to my Pool night. My rather slimmed down best bud picked me up last night on a spontaneous note to go shoot some pool. Oh man, I haven't shot a decent game of pool in a long time. I used to go every single thursday as my " guys night out ". Eric and I actually got pretty good. Tom started going for the past year or two but he is not that good. :) Actually he is good also.  Last night we just shot some pool and got around the basics of conversations. 5 pool games later, I refuse to lose a 6th time, so I called it a night. Fuck that nigga. I played damned good last night but I just couldn't get the win. I really don't care if I win or not, I play well and I am happy. Plus, I don't tend to get all competitive over a pool game where recreation is all we are getting out of it. Why even stress it??? IF I was playing against someone I didn't know or for money, I tend to bring it up to another level. I tend to play down to whoever I am up against. I do this and I have no clue why. Funny thing is, I do that in poetry also. When I am around scrub poets, I read scrubby. Since I am surrounded by these awesome poets,  I have to keep that shit on another level cause these motherfuckers make you look like shit.  Left the pool hall and headed to City Island and had the " seafood ". Yes, I had seafood last night.  I actually put into my system the stuff that gets me incredibly  " Randy BABY".!!!! 10 jumbo fried Shrimp and 6 large bottle neck clams ( RAW )!!!! You all know that myth that seafood is nature's viagra??? Well, myth or not, I eat seafood and I am about to molest the nearest watermelon possible!!!!!   ok, let me get back to my dawg Eric, we had a nice conversation about mostly everything. Our lives, weddings, friends, worries, kids, relationships. It felt kinda good that he supported my decision to be alone. He even understood it because he knows me. That kinda made me feel that my decision was the right one. We spoke about his wedding and that was cool. I can't believe that he is getting married. He is not doing that bootleg city hall marraige nonsense. He is actually doing the off the hook huge ass wedding. I am happy for him, his fiance is a great girl. Even thought she don't like me, I know she is a great girl. Why she don't like me??? heehee, I won't write that here.  So, after several good laughs and tidbits of life, he dropped me off at home. I was working my piece for the Dark future slam but that damned SEAFOOD GOT ALL UP IN MY SYSTEM!!!!!! So, I pick up the phone and call one of those sex lines. LOL.. Just joking! I did call thos back in 97 when I broke up with my ex and she took almost 700 bucks from me. The phone was under her name so I called the sex lines and just had a normal conversation with teh sex operators. They were loving me. I would call and just say, " No sex talk " tell me about you ". So 900 dollars later, I think I got my paybacks. Back to my seafood release from last night.  I picked up the phone to make a 2am booty. I put the phone down. I realized, booty calls are wrong. Plus, Oscar would have been mad at me if I called him at 2am. LOL... Don't get me wrong, I am not gay but 10 years in jail, if you are my cell mate, you better be strong and a good fighter.  So, three hours of porn and I was good. Any other information is not pertinant to write here.   Tonight is Urbana's Nerd slam. I don't think I could slam in that. I am going to protest and have someone start a ghetto slam.  Only poems about ghetto and slums allowed.  I am actually deliberating about going to Kay's Cafe to see Ebony Washington and rip her a new asshole for not showing Acentos love. Even though some people would say we don't need it, I still love to give guilt trips.  So, with my wrist hurting like hell after three hours of porn .....uh....... I mean .......typing. I will bid you farewell.   Take care  Fish

       LIfe is good   I come to work today and I feel really good. I have been in a mental rut for a while now but today I woke up, farted, rolled out of bed and smiled. Things like this is what makes me wonder why does life get hard??  You all know that I am the happiest go lucky person out there. Nothing in my life can be bad enough to make me suffer and be miserable. Yet, when I know others are hurting and in dire need of a shoulder, hug, friendly smile. I tend to suffer for them.  I feel for people so much and it hurts me to see them hurting. Funny thing is, it's like a vicious cycle. If I am the one doing the hurting to somebody, I hurt also. Hold on, I am doing the hurting so how can I hurt???  Easy, I am the lacky that has caused emotional pain to someone, that is not cool.  I have this problem and someone might think that alot of people are like this. Well, I tend to give things thought for too much time. IF I am having a conversation with you and you mention that they are laying people off in your job and your job is in jeapordy, I will tell you, " You will be ok ". Then I am off and I will feel this weight on these shoulders that will literally crush me into the ground.   I have shed many tears this week over my life getting pulled in 30 different directions. I have gone into seclusion somewhat because my constant need to be alone is hurting tooo many people. My dad's job teetering on the edge. My friends in finacial straits. I have too much to worry about. The way I used to counter this was the good ol fashioned " Fuck it ". I would just wake up and say " Fuck everything " and walk a happy strut across my ghetto.  Thing is, I can't say that to my writing, I have never had something that I have loved so much in my life. I love to just write. Whatever the case might be, Poetry, journal, letter, screenplay for my first porno. I love to just get my fingers moving on a keyboard and type some shit.  I am good . I am happy today.  Last night was Acentos and it was actually pretty good. I got there a little bit toooo late because of fucking traffic but that it was a good time to get there. The crowd was pretty consistant as it has stood that way since day one. The features last night were good. Michelle Kotler from the Community Word Project had to be the most grateful feature we have had at Acentos. She is completely adamant about her cause to help the less fortunate and I felt that it was heartfelt. Rachelle Street read one of her poems about her kids. Lisa read a poem in which I would hate to go up against in a slam. That girl has a great heart and you can feel that she is good people.  The crowd was good last night and the open Mic was very strong. Shit, suprisingly strong actually.  I got to sell 5 Cd's last night and i WAS  happy about that.  I am pimpin those cd's like my rent depended on it. I even sold one on the train this morning. I am telling you, This big intimidating body works well to scare people into buying product.  At the start of the night, the cd's weren't going to sell for 15. Yet, with the courtesy of the Acentos Founders, we sold them for ten and they went pretty good. I hope the powers that be will realize that 10 is better then 15.  sidenote : Ja-rule is going to get killed real soon. Mark my words  Back to our program.  Hope you are all well  Be good.  Peace.

      Why  First and Foremost, I would like to thank anyone and everyone who has read my blog and sent me notes of encouragement, notes of thanks, notes of appreciation and sex offers. As A man, it is hard to turn down  hours and hours of gratuitous sex, yet, I tend to stick with just women.  So guys, enough of that ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well, I am back at my job and my weekend was ok. I would write about it but it have already put it in here.   Here is a little didiy I could write about. This morning I am coming in on the train and in walks this huge ( 6 ft 5 ) woman. She has to weigh an even 200 solid. Nice skin, Long hair, Long legs that never seemed to end. Large round dark eyes that seemd hypnotic at some point. Her throat also contain a huge adams apple that seem to bobble with every click of her gum. Now people, forgive my ignorance ( or bliss ) but, I always thought that women don't have adams apples. This was one of the biggest she/ he I have ever seen. I am telling you. HUGE!!!!! I have always wondered why do people do this??? Is it genetic? Is it confusion? Is it that they like to wear female clothing? What??? Can anyone scoop me??? Don't e-mail me some intellectual thesis. Just tell me, why!!!!! I have nothing against a brotha that wnat to grow hair take hormones and even wear high heels. Damn, it is just confusing. You see this incredible woman ( or man ) and they are packing. The scary part is that they are usually packing some serious meat. Not only is she 6 ft 5 but she is carrying around 9 inches flaccid. That is not cool.   So, in my current state of being alone, I feel safe.   Let me run,   Peace, Love.  :)

       Fish ALMIGHTY!!!   LOL. I think the best thing I love about my bloggers is that I laugh from the very start of my entry. I don't give it much thought about how I am going to start it but it makes me laugh as soon as I type.  Well, yesterday was a cool day. I was home and I decided to head out and about and take on my little ghetto of the Bronx. The weather was really bad yesterday though. Then again, today wasn't much better neither.   I hung out with a friend yesterday ( Primarily because she has the movie connect and I didn't have to spend a dime ),  I headed to catch that " Bruce Almighty ". It was actually a pretty cool flick. Carrey had the whole " typical Carrey " thing going on and the movie had it's moments.  One particular part of the movie had him trying to make a prayer to God and he just wanted to best for his girl that caught him in a lip lock with another girl. So he prayed that he wanted nothing but happiness and health for his girl. He wanted her to find someone that will treat her and love her the way she needs to be treated. He wanted her to find happiness at an unconditional state.   That part of the movie hit home. I have always felt that when you have something or someone and you feel you can't treat them right, let them go. Let them go to find true happiness and love and whatever else tickles the pickles. I have done that in my life and I felt it was the right decision. Why be with someone uphappy??? You see, when you're unhappy, you will bring others down with you. I never want to bring others down with misery, pain, and some stupid shit. Some people are quick to point out, "Fish, you sound depressed ". I counter, " yea, I need to move to another country ".  Sure enough, I have given that sooo much thought over the past couple of years. Just to get up and go and just bounce. Thing is, I have soooo much stuff in my apartment, I could just put it in storage and go out and be gone. Being here alone seems selfish, being alone in another state is freedom. My parole ends on Oct 7, 2003. After that date, who knows where I will be. I could go to Florida and live there with a few freinds until my feet get grounded.  I could go to California and stay out there.  Whre would be writers paradise ? Where would I be most constructive with my writing ??? I vote California. I could maybe start writing a ghetto sitcom for UPN!  LOL  So much to think, So much to do.  Am I going to write some profound prodigal shit?>???? Nope. I am just writing what is on my mind. I guess my mind is not profound. :)  Tommorrow is  urlLink Acentos  and I am looking forward to it.  This venue is really doing well. Oscar has been doing some shit and I look up to that little motherfucker more and more. I thought for a while that LOUDER was the only features we were going to have, sure enough, he has gotten some good people to come feature. Tomorrow is Michelle Kotler he is a sweeheart and probably one of the most important people in the poetry  scene.  Ok, I am done  be good  Peace, Love, Swallow

       Gasoline and Paint and two hours of my time   Well, ajax, dawn, absolutely nothing removes the smell of gasoline. Yeserday was a rather interesting day that tested my temper. A day in which every iota of my patience was tested. I almost failed.    I was mostly in my house yesterday writing and ediitng my work. I was ready to hit Poetically Incorrect and give them something new. Behold, I get to my car and I see a flat bottle of White shoe griffinth in the street next to my car. I am walking towards my car saying........... " no..........step.........no....step...no.........step.........no......step..........FUCKK!!!!!!!!!!! White paint on the whole back quarter panel of my car, my tire, my rim. I thought that going to the car wash would remedy this situation and I would make it on time to the open mic. Go to the car wash and pay 4 bucks and go through...... Not a damned positive result. So, I am stuck with the dilema of going to the open mic in a bad mood and fucking somebody up or getting some gasoline and removing the paint. I chose option " B ". YOu people know that I take care of my car better then what I treat certain people.   I head to the gas station in hopes that it would come out quick and it took two hours of hardcore elbow grease to get the paint out. I cursed the mother of the bastard that dropped that bottle in te street. I wished death upon them every moment of my waking day. Then, I thought, what if it was my dad that dropped the bottle in the street?? Well, FUCK HIM TOO!!!!!!!!!  So, after two hours of gas wiping and actually getting kinda high. I headed home and I didn't want to be bothered. I woke up today after three showers and I can still smell the gas within skin. NO poetry, no rading, no writing, no jerking off ( My dick would smell like gas ). I was really hating life. but........  Good News, I got a phone call today from the " Bronx Academy of Letters ". This is a new High School in The Bronx that will concentrate on Writing and Poetry. June 3rd is the first open house and I was invited to speak to the man in charge and everything seems promising. Let's see how we can make this good for Louder and me Financially.  Ok, I feel better today .  I am sorry for those Phone calls I didn't take yesterday. I was a little bit busy wiping shit down.  Peace, Love, Do anal, swallow, and THREESOMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Edits, edits, edits   Yes, I am gettting ready like hel for this Dark Future slam at Bowery. I think I have my Apocalypse thing down good. I will post it here and get some insight from the three people that surf my blog.   Yesterday was my day to go the Freshstart meeting. Simplly put, it was a waste of time. What i said at the meeting, I could have said it on e-mail and the phone. I hope it is good brownie points for Louder and me. At least I walked in Professionally as possible and spoke pretty articulate.   This is my weekend and it seems that I will veg at home at my lap top writing and editing. I have two poems for the dark future slam and I need one more. I am working hard for that slam. I think I am going comedic for the last poem. If I have a good lead, I think I could pull off a funny poem. Then again, I am to new to use strategy.   Tell me what you think about this poem, just leave the comment in the Guesbook.  Peace   Fisrt Round Poem on July 3rd  " Destruction on Dependance Day"   MY APOCALYPSE The winds of Apocalypse have been transformed into the sands of Armageddon.

       Plays, prose, Poetry, and some other crazyness   Good morning folks,  ANother installment of my blog today. I just thought of something. Many of the blogs that read tend to write about some deep minding life altering moments and revelations. I tend to just write about my previous day and how I felt about it. Hmmmm.... Ok..... Let me enter some profound shit now.  " Go to bed with itchy ass, wake with smelly finger "  Ok  I'm a prophet.  Well, last night my Partner and I headed to the " Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance ". They had a show consisting of (from what I saw) Comedy, short excerpts of plays, Spoken word, interpretive dance with Poetry. This was the first time that I headed to this spot. I fell instantly in love with this spot. It had a dance floor ( not a dance floor like a club). It was for shows and stuff. The establishment had bleacher seating and great lighting. It wasn't Radio City Music hall but to see something like this in Hunts Point, it was awesome.  The show consisted of several people going up when their time was due. They did whatever they were supposed to perform and then move on. I would write what I liked most about the show but I will write about the worst moment. ( it makes for better writing )  So, I have been around the Spoken Word scene and I hae seen some winners ( Can you smell the sarcasm ?). I have seen some dudes read a poem for 9 mins and said absolutey NOTHING. I have seen some people just plain suck!! If You want a list of who they are , e-mail me and I will gladly tell you. Now, last night this dude went up and he ran an excerpt of his one man show. It was a 5 page poem of how he was living with someone that refused to flush after he used the bathroom. I give the guy credit that he got a set of balls that clank to get up there and read total garbage. He siad that writing to him was therapeauticand an alternative to a life of violence. I thought he was going to read some shit that would make Buddha go " YOU da MAn ". Yet, he actually made me want to leave. Wait, I did leave after him. I wasn't going to let this guy taint what little I have learned with saying " load and camode", Joint and Point, rush and flush" .  I supported brotha Guy last night while he read his poetry. He did his thing and most of the poetry was actually really good. One our our next features also read last night and SHIT....... Oscar made an excellent pick last night. He did really well.  Since last night I was almost Oscar's date, I had to take him out to dinner to negate everything. That motherfucker was about to put a skirt on me. He paid for my ticket to the show and brought me a soda. I said, oh no, this motherfucker is thinking some shit. So, I went and brought some popeye's chciken last night. I love that place. It is one step after White Castle.  I came home last night and made a quick shot to the bed. I was tired and I had to get up early to get here today. As you can see by this entry, that didn't happen.  We have a long weekend and I don't have plans at all. I am most likely going to Poetically Incorrect Saturday. After that, my weekend is open and most likely I will just edit and edit and edit and edit some pieces. I have two slams coming up and I am really preparing for them. I need to at least be competitive.  So let me write some more personal attributes of my life. I am feeling ok today. I was really out of it for a little bit but I am back on track and I am just " staying grounded ". These are probably the best words I have ever heard come from anyone's mouth. I have so much going on and want to go to so many places, I have lost track of who I was and what got me here. So, my life is my life and I needed to get it together. I feel better and I am happier today then what I was .  So, on that note. I hope you all have a great weekend and eat some BBQ!!!  Sign my guest book at least before you fucking leave!!!!!!  Peace, Love, Bless not stress  Fish

       Sushi and tits   Wow, what a combination!!!!!!  Yesterday was a better day then most. I felt pretty good and did sevewral things that I could consider constructive. I sold 2 more Cd's and I have three on hold until the money gets to my hands from Albany and Florida.I am going National with " 5 past 13 ". I am going to call my ex in California and tell her to get in contact with her co-workers that are mainly spread around the fucking globe. It is just a little self-defeating that I have to pay postage out of my own pocket. That is ok, I'll charge my company!!  LOL  Last night was a really nice night. I was invited to a small dinner/ going away party at Ray's house ( fellow poet ). His friend Elaine is going back to Monetreal so we all got together in his house and had a " Take out " party. Everyone that got there just ordered take out food. I have been in the mood for sushi for such a long time, so I ordered some sushi and it was ok. We all had a nice time just talking about a variety of topics. Ray and several people headed to the room and started jamming and that was awesome. Live music in one of the most laid back atmosphere's I have been in a very long time.  After the sushi ( Which made my stomach twist in several different directions ), we made our way out of there. It has been a long time so I headed to one of my pre-poetry jaunts in Queens. Dumbarton's IS ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought the place was going to be different but not one single thing has changed.  The only thing missing was the smoke. Besides that, about 10 girls dancing and trying to make money. I knew 2 of them from my " going to a strip bar everyday " days. They acted like if I died. " Whre you been?" , " Oh my God, Where have you been "?... oooooooohhhhhhhhh............ fuck you!!!! This one Dominican chic was high as fuck. I gave her my voucher to get her away from me and she drank her shot and it went straight to her head. She is straight up crazy. I asked her about doing a bachalor party in September but sure enough, she was pissed at me because I didn't get a dance with her.  I waved good bye to her and she actually rolled her eyes at me. I was like, damn, they are pretty hard up for money these days. So, my search for strippers for this party has officially started.   So..... sushi and tetas for the evening.  Not much really impressed me. They had this one chic that was pushing at least 280 pounds. I am joking you not. SHe had the ass of walrus and elephant mixed. What amazed me was that she was actually gettting guys to buy dances. Shallow Hal is in effect!!!!!!!!!  :)  Peace

       Good Freakin Morning!!!   Just got to work and I am writing to my hearts content. I feel much better today. As you know from yesterday's entry, I was hating the world and I chose to stay away from everybody. Today, I am not in the " I hope everybody dies " mode. If you would have died yesterday, I wouldn't even have paid the news any mind. Today, I might care. :-)  Well, I spent most of my evening writing last night and fiddling with my new phone. I brought a house phone with caller I.D and answering from AT&T. It cost 89 bucks at the store. Yet, catch a crackhead with a box of them selling them for 20 bucks each and you offer him ten bucks take it or leave it, and, hip hip hoooray...........new phone!! It is kinda cool. It is nice and loud ( my hearing is fucked up) and it has an answering machine with caller I.D. I can't go wrong for 10 dollars  Yesterday, a young lady signed my guestbook ( yes, PEOPLE CAN DO THAT YA BASTARDS) and she mentioned that she was on my list several years back. You see, when I first had access to e-mail in my job, that is when I really started writing some serious shit. I used to steal every single e-mail possible and just send out these e-mails that I called " Fishism's ". They were just simple rantings and freewrites about whatever topic I felt about sharing. Basically, the brunt of them were about fat chics and blowjobs. I just went overboard and wrote the most raunchy and nasty notes that would make people go " oh god that guy is sick ". Still, people tended to read them and they loved them. When I started writing Poetry 90% of the time, I stopped writing my fishism to concentrate more on my poetry and all the work that I had to get done.Some people will never forget those Fishisms and all the crazy content that went with them.  I am taking this opportunity to come back from my little mental hole that I dug yesterday. There are soo many people that I love and I can't live without.   Firstly, Eric and Oscar... These two dudes are my heart. Eric with 9 years of a hardcore friendship that has helped me through the lowest moments of my life. Oscar that single handedly jumped start my writing and has grown to be probably the most influential man in my writing in the past 2 years.  I think about these two and no matter how bad things are, we have had some moments that put a smile on my face.  There is my moms and pops, I need nothing else to say that these two people have pumped life into me. I love them dearly.  So many people and not enough time to show that love.  I feel good today.   I got love for all of you that have graced this blog today. I hope all is well.  Peace Love Bless not stress  Thanks for that e-mail dude..... the e-mail  " fell in my Lap" and it made sense.

       I am in the house   Well, I am at home and I will stay here. I wanted to show some love to the first time " Poetry Hill " at st Nicks but with the bad mood that I am in, I won't be to productive haveing people look at me wondering if I wanted to kill everything and everybody.   So, time to write some profound, prodigal shit. Here goes............  My life as Fish...    I am 32 years old and it seems that is the only thing that is good in my life.  I am a writer with a forte in Poetry. I have taken part in Slams, facilitated workshops, ran venue's, bonded with some great people. This is about as positive as it gets.  I am the perfect image of a ghetto nightmare. I have stories that makes the average human being cringe. I am saddened every day of my waking life by memories of suicide, murder, incarceration, drug use, abandonment. My Poetry talks about my life and every fucked up moment I could think of in the ghetto. Is this poetry?? How much longer will people take my images and rants of ghetto jaunts. How much writing can I possibly do until someone pulls my card and says " Can you write anythng else besides ghetto stuff?" After I break their jaw, then what?  Today was a hard day for me. I spent most of my day alone and only spoke to one friend in which I never thought I would confide in. She helped me because she too is going to something similar with a break-up with someone that she has spent 18 months with. I have someone in my life tat I am completely torn over. I wanted this woman in every sense of the word. I chased her down and I won her heart. I treated her as I treat any woman that I know is worthy to be treated as a queen. I introduced her to my parents and I was convinced that my life was going to be with this beautiful, sexy, intelligient woman. Somewhere along the line, I found myself getting increasingly aggravated. I found myself disagreeing and arguing over the smallest of reasons. I wanted to be best left alone more and more. My yearning for commitment grew strong while my taste for the solitary eclipsed almost everything. I continously battle demonsto progress in life. I knew in my life that I was destined to be a failure. I accepted it and I made it work for me. As my destiny proved incorrect, I amwriting my way into a placce in history. Someone has to write about something. That person will be me. Unfortunately, it seems that I will do this alone.  There is a woman that is incredible in every sense of the word and I can't be with her.  I have gone through several relationships and this is the end result. I am the failure in relationships and I have to fix that. I have to take some important steps to become something better. Hopefully, I can do this and be fair to any woman that comes into my life. My life..... MY life....... My life is really sucking today.  This would make for a great poem but it is just more out and out bullshit that I am writing in this journal to get it out f my system. I keep a seprate journal that I have written in for about 9 years now. Every single day, I write what I feel and it turns out to be a good way to get it out of my system.  I was really close to saying fuck everything today. I used to be very self-destructive and not care about shit. Just put everything behind me and keep on walking. For some reason, I have pt so much energy and love into my writing, I can't give up on it. Writing never gave up on me, I can't give up on it. There is so much that I would love to do and get done. I am ust taking my time and letting things come to me as they see fit. I am not a chaser of some things. I let things kinda fall in my lap. That is how my life and writing pretty much has gone, My uppercase fell in my lap and I made that a night to remember. My collective membership fell in my lap, my features, my hosting, my venue. Then again, did it fall in my lap or did I work hard to make it all pay off?  Well, time to go work on my Dignity piece. I feel like shit but my words heal. It is weird  I ranted and made no sense but that is the purpose of this..... Just to write and get things out

       Everything is good?   Well, yesterday was a good day. I had some work to do because my co-worker decided to take the day off. I don't mind, most of my day I spent switching around this blog and creating havoc. I posted some shit yesterday and if you didn't still the code, too bad. I know I pushed the issue yesterday with some immoral shit, but you know what??? I say anything in front of anybody at anytime. I am not a hypocrite. I pride myself by that motto. If I don't like you, I am not talking to you. So, here goes, if I never at anytime have even muttered a " hello" to you or attempted to engage in a conversation, this means I don't like you. Most likely, you won't like me netiehr so it's best to keep your distance. I have a persona of the nicest guy in the world, until you get on my bad side. I have a temper and I wouldn't want anyone to see that bad side.  I am not much in a good mood today as you can tell from the start of my blog. I am really close to just going away for a little while. Things are getting complicated and I am hating it. No Poetry, No Bar 13,no reading,no visits, No hanging out, No phone calls, no writing, no teaching,no nothing!!! I hate when things happen and they get me more confused and fucked up in the head. I am writing this through fucking tears right now. My life is going great with the new people in my life. The collective are a great bunch and I am loving them. Eric is my heart and I miss him so fucking dearly.  all Positive right?? Well, My dad might lose his job.  My mother is not happy just staying home.I don't know what I want in my life!!!!!!! I want get away from everything . Everytime, something happens, it makes my life worse. I don't want to speak to anybody right now. No therapists, doctors, friends, God. I want to crawl into a little hole and forget about everything positive and negative and just be alone.   Just need some time.... maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe till the day I die.   ( sigh )  I started this at 8:30am and I still haven't hit publish.  I am going to try and do something positive here.   The lovingly sexy Lynne mentioned that she will partake in the Dark Future slam. This defintely has made me go up several notches. The best feature I have had thus far was at First Wednesday because Lynne and Rog were my Co-features. If I am competing against Lynne, I have to get my Apocalypse and Headlines down to a science. I also have to write one more and I am thinking of doing a " Ghetto Matrix " type of theme.  The bar was really good yesterday. The open mic was decent and I read a piece by one of the fellas I teach over at Rikers Island. I had to tweak the piece a little bit because of the grammer issue. It was a good read and I was pretty happy. The feature was Tony Brown from Massachusets. His poetry was awesome. The images that came from his voice were hands down incredible. I got his chapbook and I was excited about reading it.  Afte Tony was the Head to head slam between Shappy and Guy. The highlight....... No fucking doubt about it.... Guy reading " Quacky ". He had the bar and me in tears. Even though it was Shappy's work, he played it to a key!!! Guy is the man. Even though Shappy beat him 3 rounds too 2. So, urbana is still under 2 slams to 1. The next head to head is Dawn -vs- Lynne. If the terms are accepted, that should be a good match. I wonder how long this is going to go for. 5 slam limit???? Best out of 5 slams ??? I would love to see other matches too....  Big George -vs- Seve Moonshine -vs- Ed Their little retarded DJ - Vs - Frant ( DJ Hot nuts )  That would be fun....  Well, let me go be in a bad mood.  I will catch all of you soon.  Peace        Not the Point

       Opinion of first time Poetry Listener   What's up folks,   Just got to the job early and I have to tell you that I hate coming here early. Last night I headed out with a couple of friends for birthday dinner. It was owed to me since January. So, I collected last night. It was cool hanging out with these two girls because they were such an important part of my life for many years. We were almost inseparabe for a while. So, being with them last night, it was really cool.  We headed to eat at a small place that ignited a furious sense of patriotism. Thy loved the spot and I am glad that we hung out. We kept everything more on a general level because I didn't want to get into gushing of emotions. The 3 of us hung last night and all three of us have been jaded in relationships. One girl was dumped after 9 years. Another was dumped after 7 years. I told my significant other that I needed to be alone after 4 months but it hurt just the same. So, My shoulder wasn't palnning on bing cried on last night so everything was kept on a " nice talkative level"  Heading to the restaurant, they asked me about my poetry and I ran down my list of what I have been doing. I mentioned the CD and the magic words were said " I would love to hear it" . Heehee.......I threw on the Cd and mentioned Roger and went to track four. About 3 mins later and I had a whole new look at the newbie coming to Bar 13. She said that she doesn't dig " hate " poetry. I was like " hate " poetry ??? I proceeded to tell her that there is a huge difference between " hate " poetry and " reality" poetry. So, she was a person that was looking for , the world is great, happy, good, and perfect place to live Poetry. I told her to listen to Track 8 and she like Oscar's Battlefield piece. So, with that on the table. It made me think. It is such a crapshoot to impress newbie's and whatever else comes to the bar. I wanted to invite her to 13 but knowing what we have on the mic, I will let her come at her own being.  All in all, I had a great time with them and it felt as if everything was good. No problems, no issues....... Just food and laughter.  I will be at Bar 13 tonight and most likely I will be at the door. Just for the record, if you come through, BUY a Fucking CD!!!!!!   Cono..... DOn't be cheap!!  Peace

       I hate computer glitchs!!!!!!!   Man, I am writing this for a second time. I wrote a whole shpiel and tried to publish it on my blog and it decides to play bellvue on me.  Well, here goes again. Last night, I have decided to remove my  ì pimp ì hat and bow down to the true master of ìpimpdomî. My buddies roomate is merely off the hook. That guy was dancing and kicking it with every single female at the party. Sir, I bow down to you and see you as my mentor.  The party was off the hook. I had such a good time seeing everyone drink dance and engage is popular bullshit conversation. Most of the night was topic to engage in was ì the Matrix ì. I actually was thinking about seeing that movie again today but I am tired as fuck.   5am and we all decide to throw on Al green and that was the highnote of the party. Just seeing everyone dance and dance drunk I tell you. I was loving it. There was this skinny chic and if I looked hard enough at her, I could see her bones. She was wafer skinny. She was cool though.  I spent most of my night downstairs on the couch just chit chatting with several people. I met this girl and she was sweet but she couldnít believe my concept of wanting to be alone. She was drunk so I wasnít trying to convince anyone that has so much alcohol in her that the only thing she understood was ì u wanna drink somthin else ì?.  MY buddy was pretty much drunk last night and she killed me.  She was moving moves to Al green and I was convinced that she would have a hangover that would make all hangovers seem tame. Sure enough, I just spoke to her and she has no HANGOVER!!! She is a trooper!!!!!!  We left the house at about 6am and headed to a small diner and had the typical breakfast. Everything was good. I dropped everyone off and I made it home at 9am. I had to do my laundry so you know that I was not a happy camper.  So, I went to bed and I got up good as new and now I have to just go get my car cleaned and gas that sucker up.  Let me run

       I hate kevin Costner    I just think he sucks as an actor. If Whitney houston was actually Madonna, that movie would have sucked and Kevin Costner would have been a nobody, wait, he is a nobody!!  Is it my imagination or do I write in my blogger more then anybody else that I know?? This is a clear indication that I am a loser. I have no life!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL  Well, yesterday was a good day. Headed out to Rikers and taught with my partner Oscar. Everything went well. The class was extremely attentive yesterday and they broke down a poem almost as perfect as seasoned writers would have.  Little by little, I keep on hearing their little stories of the everyday life of the Rikers system. Yesterday, some inmate was knocked out by a C.O. They knocked his teeth out because he made a comment that the lakers got waxed ( beat badly ). One punch from the C.O and the inamte goes down and 6 of his teeth hit the floor. Makes ya wonder who is worst in Rikers, either the inmates or the C.O's.  After Rikers, Oscar was suppose to go to a Birthday shindig but it was cancelled and he was free. So, with that being said, I have been dying to go to Brooklyn to a small little ecuadorian spot for some " ceviche ". Last night, I made it there. I was so fucking happy eating  "shrimp in warm lemon broth. On a bed of warm white rice, with a hint of Cilantro" . I love IT!!!!!!!  Life is good.  :)  Peace

       hee hee   I just got back and I swear I must have been a whore in another life. Yesterday, I made some quick flyers overviewing the " 5 past 13 A little bit Louder: Volume 1 " CD. I have Fridays off and I was making this day constructive. I headed to Barnes and Noble an the Bronx and dropped about 50 flyers there. Since I have nothing to do until 4pm, I put one Acentos Flyer/ CD flyer on every car in the Parking lot. Well, not every car. Since I ran out of flyers and I made 300 flyers, you figure it out. LOL. I truly just threw out my cell phone on these flyers. Whatever I have to do to pimp these things. I am doing it. I have to call guy or hopefully he will read this.   " I think this check wrote out a check to LOUDERARTS, I hope it can get cashed. "  Anyway, I feel ok today. No work, No poetry, no issues. I am just doing my thing.  I am going to Rikers today and everything seems well. Oscar has the Class today and Next week is the day to integrate the next instructor. Let's see how this is going to work.  Ok, I brought mself some " cookies and cream " ice cream. So while most of you guys are at work right now, I will be in my boxer shorts gratuitously scratching and watching porn. I just wanted to share.   Well, more on my stupidy later.  Peace. Love, May your booty never get as big as J-lo

       3am and here goes my 2 cents   well, I was trying to avoid the whole uh............bullshit........that is going on in the world of spoken word. Yet, since I have my blog as a form of therapy and outlet of my thoughts. I have to say something. It is kinda hard to write while watching porn so let me just turn it to the weather channel first.   Bar 13 ( Louder ) has become an integral part of my world. Yes I said that. Going there on Monday after Monday and hearing all sorts of poets pour there writing on the microphone is my very way of getting better. f I see someone that sucks, that tells me I have to make sure I never read some shit like that in my life. If I see some mind bending shit, I definitely want to get to that level of writing. I tend to soak up as much informatin from everyone that I speak to. They make think it is a small insignificant conversation but it is actually a lesson that I am absorbing mental notes on.  This whole thing about the slam is kinda a touchy subject for many people. This year we have a team of vetrans that is going to rep 13. Shit, it is a pretty good team and it seems promising for 13. Yet, slams are so unpredicatable, you just never know. I still feel that this whole thing that we are going through should have came up after the team came back from Chicago. In order for a team to win, don't they need an unconditional support??? I am not going to play on a football team and get to the playoffs and have the owner and shareholders talk shit right before our most important regional games. How can i give the team 100%?  I am a new writer to the scene and I am working my ass off to make sure tat one day I will kill everyone that even thinks about competing with me in a slam. I want to have people look at me as a powerhouse. Still, after all is said and done, I know that slams are not my epitome of writing. I have tours, books, features, and who knows what else.  There is so much going on right now that I dn't even know where to start. I have love for people and I want to see the best for them, I still know that I have to do for me. Don't get it twisted, I never want to see nothing bad for my brethren, I am just still doing me and what is better for me.  I know that things get hard and it is easy to just say fuck it and walk away. Thing is, when things are hard, that is just life playing those fucked up tricks on you. I was about two seconds away from walking on Acentos at one point, then I realized that the reason that want to walk away is because I actually fear getting hurt down the road.That and the fact that I wanted to strangle my partner at one point. I don't want acentos to be regarded as a failed effort by anyone in the spoken word community. That was one of my fears. If I am not a part of that, I could not be considered a failure.  I have to say that unfortunately, there will be people that will hate on you for your writing. I havn't heard anyone blatantly hate on me but alot of people are scared of me. Since I have my own style too, I can't really be judged too much by others.  I am not metaphor filled, I am not political, I am not Shappyish. I have a power and style that belongs to me and that might be the reason that I came to my own.  I am glad that I came to y own at louder. Why ??? If I can make it at Bar 13, I will make it at any other venue in NYC. That is basically a fact.  Louder isn't scared to tell you that your poem is bad. I rather have that then have any bowery, nuyo, cornelia venue applaud my work and say it is awesome when it really sucks. The three hardcore poems that I love and people at 13 have given the green light too, any other venue will AUTOMAtICALLY approve. That is the way I see it.  The bar is set high at 13. If you want to go there with half ass work. You will know it is half ass. This is not a friendly newbie environment but great writers are born from there. If those motherfuckers with half ass work come to 13 and drop on the mic with some wack shit and they ask " how was my poem? ", and you tell them  that it needs some work and they catch an attitude and walk out like a little bitch, well then, I don't need that shit or them around. Imagine them in a work shop.  " My work is hot" " I know what I am talking about " " But you don't understand " " I like it " " You need to listen to it "  Motherfucker, why are you in a workshop if you are not taking critique then.   I am done.... I rant and said too much  Peace

       ******* WARNING******* WARNING**** WARNING****   The following will ruin any hopes you all have to see the Matrix reloaded without knowing what happened   Good morning folks, I hope that you are all doing well today. I just got to work and I should be tired as fuck but I am not. I am gettting back to my not sleeping days and I feel actually really good. " Sleeping is the cousin of death"  Yesterday was my feature at " Brown Suger " in the Do or die of Bed Stuy. It was a nice experience. I headed out there with my crimee and partner OMX and the evenng proved interesting from the jump. Only in NYC you can be outside a bar rehearsing your poetry and about 13 shots ring out about three blocks away.Since there was a nice thick tree in front of the club, I just  stood behind the tree while too many nosy brothers walked towards where the shooting was. Ok, I have seen my fair share of ghetto antics. From what I know, when there is a shooting, you walk the other way.  Yet, this is NY. This was " BED- STUY"!!!!!!  The open mic was ok if not balh to say the best. Man, going to Bar 13 and seeing these open mic folk, you actually see some good people on the open mic at 13. I felt bad for some of the people that got on that mic and were fooled by the audience ( of course because they don't know any better ) with " shock and awe " with a poem that needed about 4 weeks of workshop. Yet, this is what happens when people are not exposed to some good poetry. The roses are Red and Violets are blue is the only thing they know.   I went up first for my feature and I had a very good time. Don't get me wrong, I made a few little mistakes and I had the carnal sin of letting the audience know that I fucked up at one point. Yet, they were very, very, receptive. I had them laughing, I got several key little messages out. EG: Stay out of trouble        Love the little kids and teach them right        Don't get caught up in some bullshit cause the system sucks After finishing, I got several accolades and I made my exit to the place I call the boogie down. Picked up Roger and Marty at parkchester and headed to the Whitestone.    *********Do not read this part*********  The Matrix was fuckin awesome. Some of the fight scenes were completely mind blowing. The scheme of the movie was a little bit more complicated then the first movie. This was a movie that threw action at you and you also had to go into to understand it. Agent Smith made his return and was funny as fuck for most of the movie. Trinty was awesome. I have a total new found respect for that Keanu Reeves shmuck. I know tha he is not a 9 th degree black belt but I give the guy credit. Some of the things he did ( regardless of the special effects ) require alot of hard work and dedication. Jada Pinkett smith kinda sucked. Well, not sucked, she didn't really have much going in the movie.   At the end of the movie, they showed the next trailer for the " Matrix: Revolutions". This movie is going to break 300 million just this weekend alone.  I say, go see this movie once and maybe consider seeing it twice. The movie is that good.  Ok, on that note.   I shall bid ya ado  Peace  Grease  I'm Out!!

       This is what happens when you can't sleep   Well folks,  If I would have waited to get to work to make my blog entry, it would have been worthless. So, with a bottle of pepsi at my side, a head full of thoughts ( some restricted ), and an itchy trigger finger with 6 co-horts ready to fisticuff at any moment.  Firstly, my night went great. I did the door most of the evening and my idea of bringing in change was right on the money. I never once needed to bother Maureen for change and everything went well. Matter a factly, I owe guy 23 bucks that I kept in my pocket, I will add it next week. I didin't realize that my tolerance has been so low lately. Someone witnessed me today get in full fledge bad ass mode on some rowdy patrons coming up the stairs to the bar. Damn, I need to remove some of these thoughts that are stressing me and erasing my tolerance.  The slam was pretty good tonight and I am glad that the house was packed.  We saw some heavy weights come through to engage some microphone  " spitting ". Celena Glenn, Beau Sia, Sekou the Misfit, and some others.  Ok, let me write about the slam a little bit. First off, I am one dude that is hard to impress. Last night, Dawn Saylor impressed me more then ever. She was a nervous little wreck in the first round and thought that she didn't make it out, I told her to just relax and she''ll be fine. Sure enough, Shappy went up to the stage and due to the wonderful world of time penalty, shappy was bumped in the first round. I had thought shappy would have made it further but things are so unpredictable in slams that you just never know.  I am not even going to lie to you. I want to write mad shit concerning Shawn in the slam and my opinion on it. Thing is, I would be writing thoughts of other people and I am not going to do that.  To put it simply, Shawn slammed, Shawn got elimanated. Period.   Claudia got up there and dropped a poem that got her eliminated. The poem was ok. Compared to everything else that the mic was sucking in, ok wasn't cutting it.  OH SHIT.......... They are giving " Perfect Strangers " on Nickelodeon. I am a single man at 4 in the morning with my cable on Nick at Night. There is something universally perverted about that. So..........     Back to the slam.....  Roger, Tai, Lynne, Marty and F. Omar Telan as the team alternate. This is going to be a power house team and I hope they click. I am going to chicago this year and I swear if I remotely feel some bullshit, I am pulling collars and smacking people. I want Bar 13 to have a national championship!!!!  Went to get some food and drove OMX , Guy, and Lenny home. Had a great conversation with Oscar and Guy about certain moments in the slam. Dropped Oscar off and had a good candid convo with Guy. The guy is gully and he will read this and wonder why I wrote it.  " easy guy, straight shooters are always straight shooters in any situation.  "  Well, here are some thoughts that are going through my head. Next year, I should be able to compete on a good level to give these fuckers competition. I chose not to this year because I knew I wasn't ready. I wasn't going to fool myself. Just looking and letting everything sink in will help and benefit me greatly in the next round of slams coming in the years end.  Writing is something thatI love to do. Let it be Poetry, journal entry, dabbling, or whatever the case may be. Hear is what scaring me. I am loving Acentos and all the work that is involved. Yet, I want to maintain my writing. I don't want to fight to have time to write. I want to have fun writing.  I want to enjoy the words that are born from the tips of my 7 fingers. I want to look at a poem that I wrote after weeks of editing and be proud of me for the achievement that I just did.  I don't want to sit behind my laptop and cry at 4:30 in the morning because I can't sleep because I need to write. I don't want to miss writing. I don't want to lose writing.  You know why it took me sooooo long to come to where I am at??? Here it is.   I have nothing. My car will die My clothes will fade My family will die My friends will move on I rent an Apt  I have nothing in my life but the words that are carefully resurrected from stringent thoughts ranging from my days of  pain to my days of bliss.   My words are all I have and it took me many many many moons to fuckin share them. When I read a poem, I am not reading a poem. I am reading a piece of me. A piece of my heart that I chose to slice out and place it on the stage.  Oscar, I love you man. You my nigga.  I always than Oscar for walking down this road and leaving little mementos for me to pick up on.   Oh, and I took the code from your blogger and WHAT!!!!????????  Sue me dammit!!!  ok.... it is about 5am and I need to at least get two hours of sleep. I will be cranky and I hope things go well. Acentos is tomorrow and it should be good.  Peace

        Time to just babble   What's up good people.  I am here at the job and just doing nothing like every normal day that I am here. I will make believe like I am doing something to give everyone the guise that I am worth something here .  :)  Well, Tonight is Bar 13 Grand Slam Finals. 9 poets go up and do their thing to try and make the team to represent the Union Square Bar 13 team in Chicago this August. I have to go to the bank and take out at least 300 dollars in change. mostly 5's and singles. The cover tonight is 7 dollars and that uneven number will make change hard to come by. So, I will just have that much money and tell Guy that I will add it to the purse and to give it to me at the end of the night. I am expecting a shit load of people tonight. So, with Tom's assistance, he and I will man the door. I will collect and Tom will watch my back and the crowd. I don't expect shit to happen but my forte is security and a wicked right hook to the jaw. So, tonight is " door and Security mode ". Oh.... if you are not slamming or part of the Collective, pony up 7 dollars. Bring an extra 15 to buy the CD also.  So much is going on and it can be very exhausting on the mind if you let it get to you. I don't want to put out business but damn. Why are things made difficult????. I believe in hard work will get shit done. I have always been self reliant and never depended on nobody to do shit for me.  -  I pretty much knew that as long as OMX and I were almost on the same page for Acentos, that we wil do well. He has the ideas and I play them out and vice versa.   - My football team needed a kick in the ass, I threw on my Timbs and started swinging My Friends call me for advice, I give them the straight shot and that is it. No beating around the bush. Just get it done as righteously as possible and live your life.   I hate politics and bureaucracy. I have dealt with corporate mierda for 14 years and I have despised the ass kissing, brown nosing, back stabbing, butt fucking.  Unfortunately, I have to had played the game in order to be at this place for 14 years. I am still considered a straight shooter by most.  I am a laborer. I work with my hands. I can swing any tool and create a masterpiece with the right guidance or my very own know how. This is why I hate motherfuckers that never lifted a box in their life. They don't know the meaning of hard work and dedication.   You want something to work, work FUCKING AT IT!!!!!!  I am not in a good mood.  Time for me to just count my fingers and just chill   Anyway, tomorrow is Acentos and I hope to see plenty of you gracing our venue. It has been going very well and I am very happy with everything in general. We have been getting great accolades from the Poetry Community. Hard work baby, hard work. Still, awesome venue withstanding, we still need an audience.  HINT HINT!!  Take care.  Peace

       weekend stupidity   oh man, I am not much on writing when I could be watching porn but my Laptop has proved worthy of my fingers caressing it's keys. I removed everything except Word and AOL. Tis laptop moves faster then DSL. Ok, Not the point.  I think you might have read my previous entry. I was laying down a wooden floor this weekend and it tested every facet of my moral boundaries. I was tired, aggravated, pissed and every other word to just merely give you the slightest description of 13 hours of pure unadulterated hell. At least I got the floor done and the lady was estactic to say the least.   Ok, So........... I went down to the bowery today to catch Cheryl Boyce Taylor and her Son " Phife Dawg " from a Tribe called Quest. The poetry was off the hook and Phife { if that is even his real name } was really good.  I walked in ans was sprised to see my Dawg " NostraEmus". We hung for about 1 hour and the laughs was more then what I had for the wee. I love that guy.   OMX came across some tickets to the oFF  Broadway show of " Blue Man Group". We headed there for a 5 pm showing and I have to tell you. It had to be the best show of ANYTHING  I have seen this year. The show consisted of Drums, Humor, A SHITLOAD of PAPER streamers!!!! It was merely " off the hook ".  Everything is ok. I went through a small emotional train wreck this afternoon but I Know what is best for me. Fish needs to do Fish.    Oh man, porn time.  Peace

       Why do I do these things????   So, yesterday my life went in a different direction like always. I was supposed to be going to " pregones Movie house" to catch a play of some sort. My dad decided to get  a referral for the eye doctor so Fish was on foot  and threw my plans into the gutter. So, one interesting evening spent at home won't kill me. Funny thing is, 8:30pm was my first jaunt in La La Land. I fell asleep in my couch and that is not comfy. I don't know how people can nap on the couch the whole night. So, my power nap ended at 3:30am and I was up. Ok, so I was up and I turned on the Boob tube and BEHOLD!!!!!!.................. They were giving " Orca ". Oh man, I loved this movie. This flick was shot and released in 1977. It starred " Richard Harris " as an ignorant Irish Fisherman ( which the apple didn't fall far from the tree because he is Irish ). He is hunting Great White Sharks and comes Across an Orca Whale making minced meat out of a Great White. Sure Enough, Orca's are bigger and badder then great white so we have Harris hunting the Orca. Fast forward.........   He hunts Orca Shoots at Male Orca Misses and hits female Orca which is pregnant and miscarries baby orca on boat Male Orca goes O.J and stalks harris and creates havoc on the town Towns people force Harris to Hunt down Orca Harris Follows Orca to Iceland Orca methodically kills crew Catches harris is water after he destroys boat Tail whips harris onto iceburg and kills him  This Movie was incredible because I saw it when I was 6 years old with my dad in the movie and it kept me interested. I kinda appreciated the movie even more now because I could actually understand more of the movie.  So, I would write about my dreams but most likely you would never come back and read my blogger.  I swear to you........ I have issues!!!!!!!!  I will write some more later. I have to sneak out of here today.  Peace

        Jerry lewis has to be the  funniest guy ever    Oh man, I wake up and I want to write a quick blurb and they are giving Jerry Lewis in " Don't give up the ship ". Everyone talks about how he was only funny with Dean Martin.............well, Martin wasn't in this movie and lewis is funny as hell.  Right now he is diving underwater and a huge octopus is tapping on his shoulder while he is excavating something. He doesn't notice it and the Octopus wraps around Lewis. He turns around and lets out a Home Alone yel and swims so fast out of the water that he shoots out the top like a dolphin. I tell you, this guy is the funniest. I used to love those older comedies. Not one of these new wave comedy flicks can hold a candle to Lucille Ball, Abbot and Costello, Laurel and Hardy,  Three Stooges, or the Marx Brothers. Those were the days that we had good clean comedy.  I should have been born in the 40's  I love old cars, Old movies, and I am intrigued by history.  I tell you, I was born in the wrong time.  Last night was the SynonymUS thing at the Bowery. Very small turnout compared to whatever I think I would compare it too. I would shoot this show down but it was pretty decent. I stood for about 30 minutes of it because I wanted to head to the Blue Ox. The only thing that makes me think is, everyone for the exception of maybe two people ( from what I saw ) was part of the collective.  Oscar,Ray/ Seve, White chic that her name has eluded me/ Ginna, Betty/ Sabrina, Bongo boy/  You know, after writing it out, there were actually several people not from the collective. Hmmmmm...... There goes that argument. yet, they still need more people to go out there. I don't see a valid excuse for it to be that empty. Especially with the people running it. These are heavyweights in the scene and know more then enough people to pack the place.   Well, For myself...... I headed to the Blue Ox and I was shocked at how packed it was. I never seen it that packed!!!!!!  I got there and people were listening in from the door outside. I just missed Anthony Morales do his thing because Leslie followed the Acentos format of Half the Open mic and then the features. I saw Gammel ( If I spelled his name right ) and he was ok. The palce was hot as Fuck and that is worrying me for the summer months in which we will have to OPEN THE DOOR!!!!!! It was sweltering in that bitch last night. I networked last night with the people after words and of course plugged Acentos like my life depended on it. I hope we get at least three of them people to come back. One older man wanted to read a poem but it was all in Spanish and he was n';t too comfy reading it in front of the WHITE people. I kinda sort of felt where he was coming from but he was actually very arrogant so I quickly threw him in the " fuck him " category. I hope he doesn't show up to Acentos. I am lacking Patience for people like that.  I read my Apocalypse piece yesterday and I got the reaction that I wanted. I got the " Damns, and Oh shits ". So I was happy that I read there. Reading on the open mic was this fat chic named Mabel that was in my workshop. This chic must have eaten several poetry books. She performed actually MUCH MUCH better then what she used to. I was suprised to see that. She still sucks but just not that bad.  I spoke to the owner of the Blue Ox last night after he came to me and basically gushed Thank You's over 20 times. He said that the Bar has been getting phonecalls every single day concerning Poetry readings. I know I left over 150 flyers there for Acentos and they all were gone when I got there yesterday. I am not sure what to make of it but the owner is pretty much riding the poetry bandwagon to keep him floating. He kept on saying that it's been " Slow as hell for the past month " .  This worries me because if the Blue Ox closes, we have to find another venue.  This would not be fun. Even though I have a friend that has a bar on Westchester, I am not trying to move anywhere. I hate change sometimes. Well I hope to catch ya soon.   Peace   fish

      Oh man, you know those little trucks on almost every street corner that sell bagels and all that shit?? well, I brought some doughnut type thingy and it was off the hook. It has chocolate and sugar and everything. Shit, I just noticed, I think I am getting wired. Too much sugar early in the morning will have me on the go.   So people, I have to give you a little insight on me. I want you to get an idea about something that I like.   Many people like to be in the company of others most of the time. I used to be one of those people that was always surrounded day in and out by my boys, homegilrs, and everything else. Thing is, when my life started going south, I spent sooo much time alone that it was peaceful. No drama, no fights, no beef, no advice hunting, no arguments, no nothing. My little safe haven was the penthouse at Perry Ave ( Top floor of an old building actually). I wonder if that will ever change. I like to be alone but I love commitment. I like comittment but I love to be alone. It is hard for me and I have to put things in priority. Thing is, right now is my alone time in my life and it seems best for me now. A relationship for me will not be suited for my mindframe. I also just want to be fair to whomever I decide to be with. I made my mistakes in the past and let them blow up. Now, I am a man and I will take care of everything as righteously possible.  All is good though  Take care  Peace  >)))">

      Good morning,  Here I am once again at home when I am supposed to be getting ready for work I decide to jump on the PC and write in the Blog. Well folks, I am good. I came home last night and fell asleep at 7pm. I would loved to have slept straight through but I woke up at 10pm and that is all she wrote. Stood up most of the night working on this poem about the lack of dignity in my neighborhood.  Poetry has really gotten to be hard for me lately. Before I could have just written enough to take up one page and I would have read it and it was all good. Thing is, after taking workshops and people read good shit, I can't read half ass work. So instead of writing a poem in ten mins. It takes me about two weeks. Don't get me wrong, it is good that I have this dedication on doing it. I just have a whole new outlook on poetry. It is positive and it is keeping me happy.  Well, I will act like an assshole when I get to work. Right now, I need to go to work  Peace

      Ok, I just got to work and everything seems pretty cool. I am going through some " woman " trouble but I hope to rectify it before anyone gets really hurt. My " wanting " to be alone is proving to strong to overcome. Not the point.......  Last night was offically the worst night I have seen at Bar 13 in 2003. I have to really say this, I don't give a bodacious flying fag fuck, Big Mike needs to be shouted out. I don't care if people think he is crazy or not. Why waste time by talking about pussy, cock, and what you would do to a pussy with you cock. We , especially me, don't give a fuck!!! I have seen the dude several times and everytime he has gotten on the mic and stepped off the stage , I see a pop up ad above his head that reads " asshole ". Don't get me wrong, he seems like an ok dude but the asshole factor is hardcore when he reads.   That is not the end, then, his girl got on the stage and I don't know what the hell was going through her head. She did something. Was it a poem?? Was it a story? Was it prose?? What the hell she did????????????? She did have a sexy little limp that I was kinda curious how she got. besides that, if Guy ever let's her back on stage....... DUDE, I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!!!!!!  Other then that, the night was so-so. Omri did his thing and actually shocked me. he has a pretty big voice for a little dude. Farbeon needs to be told that he is a better poet then a rapper. Yet, to each his own. VooDooLooLoo got on stage and worked the 5 people at Bar 13. There was no one there even slightly interested in the show. I figure that she comes and features that she will have tons of people. She had about 5 show up. I wonder how many people will show up when I make it big and get official features and all? I had God knows how many just for the Uppercase. We will see.  oh........ guess who won the Pool at bar 13 in picking which poets made the finals??? ME~!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL...... YeA!!!!!  I got a full 50 bucks. I am telling Guy to make an offical announcement on my victory. Then, I entered a raffle and won a CD from VOODOOLOOLOO. Ok, that name is too long to fuckin type.  Headed to resovoir last night and had a nice time eating. It beat out White Castle but I am still loyal to my murder burgers.  well, time to start writing about some profound shit. I can't act like a fool all the time.   I have been catching myself talking alot about my students at Rikers. I have really gotten attached to this whole program. Just simply because I am giving back to the same dude that were me several years ago. I constantly think of what I can tell them to make them think about the outside world. I want them to become better writers and maybe even fullfledged poets. That is one reason that I am taking these workshops. If I better me, I better whoever I decide to teach. Even though this Friday, Oscar is teaching the class, I will be there and maybe I will pick up some pointers from him. He has a different style then mines and it never hurts to learn from others. Teaching has to be the best experience I have ever had. I am doing it for free and people get paid to do this??? Then they have balls to beef???  That is beyond comprehension for me. All in all, this  has opened doors and it will be chalked up as a learning experience.  I have to work on a piece I started about " lack Of dignity in society ". I started it in Cheryl 's workshop and she loved it, I have to add on and edit.  Ok, enought shit from my mouth. I am out.  Peace  Fish  >)))">

Here I am at home with bad breathe, eye muck, farty smelling boxes ( cause we all know that at night men fart like freight trains going across America ), and the most tangled up hair I could have woken up with. THis Blog has proven to be something special. I could write and be a true Blue knucklhead and just not care. yea!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok, eye muck is falling onto keyboard, time to go shower. I will hit it later.  Peace

      Good morning,  I am back at the job and I am writing to my hearts content in the wonderful sick world of blog. Oh man, I thought I was going to die yesterday. I had this trail of intestines coming out of my ass. I must have eaten something that made my stomach churn in 69 different directions. So, I stood home yesterday with my buttcheeks stuck around the porcelin crown. Then, wiping the as 40 times a day makesthe asshole raw. You ever had an irritated butthole??? that is not fun. As soon as the baby soft Charmin touches the " culito " it is the fires of hell exploding around the asshole.  :)

      Good Morning,   This blogger is going to mean the death of my budding career in Poetry. I tend to just put all my energy into writing in the journal and before you know, Poetry is not being born. All is well with me, I woke up a little while ago and I feel good. I have two workshops that I have to take today and even those seem questionable.   I was reading some of the other bloggers that belong to my brethren. They are truly pushing envelopes. This dude Guy is straight up Gully, ghetto, crazy, doesn't give a flying fuck what any thinks about him or what he writes. I want to grow up just like him. I know he is pretty complex in some ways but the guy is more then a straight shooter. He says it straight and narrow and to the point. He doesn't take three hours to say some thing that you can some up in two words.  Like I mentioned yesterday, I went to go see X-Men with Oscar. The movie was actually really good. I don't want to get bold and say it was better then the first one but it was really really good. A small part of the flick was fucked up on the sound but it was atually kinda funny. It looked like one of those old Chinese voice over flicks.   Well, time for me to ounce out and I will catch you all later. peace  >)))">

      Well, I am back from a fucking long day. I am tired and I could barely even write nor even think. So, today was the day that MR Oscar and myself went to Rikers and GODDAMN ys,it was merely fucking perfect. No delays with clearance. The Class was attentive as hell and it was the best experience I had teaching at Rikers so far.  I finally got around to getting my tattoo. I got Poetry on my inner left forarm and it looks good. I also got to go see X-men with Oscar. I had one very longgggggggggggg day. Will give further details later    Peace  >)))">

      Time to START THE REVOLUTION!!!!!!! URBAN POETS will RISE UP against the man and change the wayward ways of the white man!!!!  Last night was the finals in Urbana and it basically sucked. THat is even giving them credit. I think the host is what killed me. If he reads poetry the way he hosts, he is going to SUCK really bad.!!!!!!!!!. Ok, so the new team from Urbana will now live up to the word " Urban ". Nothing but black folk across the board made the team. I actually don't mind and I even like it to be that way. Taylor is going to do some crazy shit. I hope he works off Julian's " Nigger " poem. This dude dropped a poem last night and said " nigger " 42 times. He will put Quentin Tarrantino to shame.  All in all, the slam didn't impress me. This year, not many slams impressed me at all. I guess in going and hearing so much poetry, you don't get wowed as much. Yet. I hope the Finals at Bar 13 will be killer.   Let me see who is in finals.....  Roger F Omar Lynne Dawn Shawn Shappy Marty Tai Claudia  I am going to go out on a limb and try to pick the players for the 2003 Union Square team. Shawn is questionable because he could actually drop out and that could leave Isle with a chance to make the team. So, I will throw her in by default.  This years Union SquARE  tem will be ..............  ROGER, TAI, Claudia, Shappy......... Marty as the Alternate. Shappy will be the obligatory white man and he would balance off well the team.   Shit, let me go do my rikers class, I am taking Oscar today.  Peace my nizzle'z!!!!!!!!!

      What's going my brethren???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Today is my first day off of two. Toorrow, I have off and I have the poetry workshop that I am running in Rikers Island. Yes, I have actually gone out and took over a workshop in Rikers Island. Of course, I am teaching inmates from a variety of ages. Tey are all pretty smart and have a decent knack for writing. I have to thank my Dawg Rog for giving me this opportunity. This guy is awesome to say something about him on the smallest of scales. So, I am off to the Island tomorrow with my Dawg Oscar in tow. He is smart as fuck so I wouldn't worry about him on the teaching aspect of t all. Yet, I hope he gets used to the guys in this jail setting. Me?????? Well, I felt kinda right at home.  Tonight is my night to head to the Bowery and just get a fill of " Finals " poetry. They have the usual schmoes up there and it should live up to the " Urbana " type of poetry that it is.  I am thinking " George is making it. Postmidnight might have a go. RAC and mabe Dawn Saylor. Cristen might get in the mix one way or the other. I wish Taylor was on the team. Iactually like that guy. He is kinda like the white version of me.   Well, on that note...... Time to bounce.  Peace  Fish

       Why oh why?   I am officially a fat bastard!! MY tux jacket is a 52 and that means that I am wayyyyyy tooooo big. The guy fitting us was saying that I wasn't that big. He says this because he was at a hefty 375 pounds before his " Gastric Bypass " surgery. This is that whole staple your stomach for you won't eat that much. Shit, it's a thought.....  Anyway..... yesterday was such a good day. Headed down to the SynonymUS jam at the studio at 26th street. This was my first time at a studio and I can't believe the awesome time I had. I was slightly miffed getting there ( not really mad, just felt weird ). yesterday was the gay pride parade. Thousands of gay people marching down fifth ave to celebrate their Queerdom. So walking past the parade with my Poetry shirt that says boldly " My life is different then yours ". Too many people were thinking I lived the gay lifestyle. At least that is what I was thinking. IF I am walking down the Gay pride parade and I see a guy with a shirt that says " my life is different then yours ", he has to be gay. So, yesterday, I was gay. It was n't that bad but it was just for one day.  Got to the studio and I was amazed at all the equipment that was in the room.  Mics, Speakers, Drims, Keys, Congas. Ray was the genius behind this madness and I was totally impressed by Raymond Daniel " the sensitive one " Medina. This motherfucker got everything together and rocked hardcore. Omri, who has been a straggler here and there ( that is not a bad thing ) took his guitar and made tha bitch scream. He took it to some serious levels that impressed the fuck out of me. Peter was jamming on the drums and he was awesome. So, the premise of this was to collaborate between musicians and poets. Seve was there and blessed us with a piece from " Cosvlaw ".... I will get the right spelling for you later. He really kicked ass on the piece. The tone was solid and the music behind seve had good flow.  Jessica, Oscar, Jai ( who is really a fuckin good poet ) and Myself did our thing during seperate moments. I dropped my Apocalypse piece with Jessica doing some jazzy operatic tones vocally in the backgroud. I started my piece with a low tone and hit my mark halfway through it and we jammed hard. I felt some serious adrenaline rushing. It brought a whole new life to the piece and I left there with a whole different style of how I wanted to do the piece Thursday at the dark future slam.  At the end of the session, we just wanted to jam out hard and Gerard ( toro's partner in crime showed in the evening and rocked with us ) and he started with the congo. I started feeling it and started dropping my Bronx piece. Oh man, it sounded awesome but we had some MIC problems. We kicked it hard and finished it with Seve and I doing a " HOT " duet. We would just scream the word " hot " into the mic and it added this energy taht was crazy.  The ideas for the Bronx piece were flowing too much after we left the studio. Tonight, " Yo soy del Bronx " is going to have a new meaning. Off Hand, Oscar, Chance, myself, and I need a girl to read two lines in my poem. So if you are a girl and want to rock out tonight at LouderJAM, E-MAIL ME!!!!!  I came home and parked and I was just moving mentally a million miles per minute. I can't explain to you the whole rebirth with this jam. It was just such a new expereience and I had a great time.  Raymond, Omri, Peter, Seve, Jai, Oscar, Gerard, Jessica, and the other girls there that their names are escaping me . It was an honor to be amongst you talented motherfuckers!!!!!  Tonight, WE ROCK!!!!!!  Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       MY neighborhood is shit   11pm and I take a shower and I make my way out in the neigborhood. All I take is 10 bucks with no id. Why do I do this??? Here is a tip for all you people out there. When you are out on the street late at nghtt, from the point of view from someone that will mug you and maybe one day even get mugged, turn your pockets ( in front )inside out, turn around and lift up your shirt and show that there is no wallet. Two things can happen, you will get shot in back of the head or the person will walk away with just your ten bucks. Another note of interest, you can get into basically anything and not get caught up leaving your ID behind. Not the point.........  Last night, I did my walk around the nighborhood to get a pizza and maybe find a newspaper to read sitting in front of the church. The pizza sucked and the newspaper had nothing of " life value ".  I did see a cab driver get into a hefty argument with the dude the cab dropped off. You can tell that both of them were totally full of shit. Nothing but " fuck you's " were thrown back and forth for about 10 minutes.  No swinging of crushing of facial bones. I actually wouldn't have minded seeing a good old fashioned scrapping in the middle of the street.  Seems like the black dude knew several of the young kats in  the building and when they came out and chased the cab driver. A simple push of the gas pedal, the cab driver is gone.   I go back to my newspaper and read that " lil kim 's " chain was found. I was shocked, I thought that she was bullshitting to sue or something.  This is when this one chic walks by me and asks me for the time. I told her it was about 1:30am and she went on her way.  I was kinda thinking, where did this girl have to be at this time in the morning. I pay it no mind........  2 : 30 comes and the time chic returns, across the street were 2 dudes that were walking rather slowly. My ghetto instinct puts 2 + 2 together and  figured this was a great time to set me up. She is walking closer and I get up and start stretching and walking. If I would have heard her say " excuse me Mister, " or anything to get my attention, I would have stabbed her in her throat and walked away. This way, the two guys would be too busy with her throat hanging out her neck and that would have given me enough time to get to safety.   I walk to my building. The guys kept on walking and the girl was no where near them. Kinda makes ya think how things can be taken out of hand sometimes. Better out of hand then being set up. Then again, I on had 3 bucks in my pocket. I could have just given up those three bucks and " maybe " gotten home Remember the first option. This train of thought is maybe why I have no fear of going anywhere at any time. I have been there on both sides.  Ok, tux fitting day.  Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       Jail and Birthday's   The wonderful dog days of summer are upon us and I was in Jail. Literally, amongst some of the inmates participating in a workshop facilitated by My Bermeo. It was a good class yesterday. I took place in the first two freewrites because I had soooooooooo much on my mind. The premise of the freewrite was to write about anything that you wanted. Any subject, any topic, any format. I journaled my way through it and I basically touch of my very low tolerance as of late. The second freewrite was to pick one line from the first freewrite and I go with it. I still stood on the same topic.  It felt good to write. I haven't felt like I have written something decent for a very long time. I still write but it is mostly in my journals. I think I might be using all my creative juices on these blogs.    I mentioned to the fellas that My 4th of July will not see me coming to rikers for the workshop. I want to go to a BBQ and maybe just go into my little hole to be alone. I know that I spend alot of time alone but the 4th of July is different for me. Last Monday ( June 23 ) was the anniversary of me losing my fingers. 11 years and counting. 11 years of reliving bad memories. Constant reminders of pain. The typical : why did this shit happen to me ?". It is not as bad as it was 10 years ago. Still, I look at my hand and remember that at the age of 22, I had 10 healthy fingers.  So, the 4th is kinda hard for me and I tend to go to my usual spot and be alone. This year, I will be alone but I will chronicle everything in my little book. I need to get a good battery for I can start lugging my laptop around.  Yesterday was Keith Birthday and we met up with him at a restaurant ( sammy's ). They actually had the awesome Chinese food. I had this sweet and sour chicken that was off the hook. Trying to find parking to get there was a mission in itself. Then, when I did find parking, it was about 9 blocks away and I was walking with my good friend " gimpy ". His gout was acting up and him walking like a normal human being seemed totally out of the question.  After Keith Shindig, we headed over to meet up for Seve's Shindig. He had a little get together at Hudson Bar and books. We gimped our way there and outside was Seve looking smooth the the fresh cut and the Guyavera ( Spanish going out shirt ). Smooth motherfucker you. Inside were some of the regular louder folks and I had a great time. I was kinda quite listening to this one girl talk ( and boy could she talk ). When she started going into religion, that is when I made my exit. I know that there are three things I never talk about, Religion, politics, and sex. Ok OK.....so two thngs. I wanted to go pick up that hooptie and I wasn't waiting for the gimp so I left him behind to pick it up and  walked down Hudson. This is when I was talking about God alot..........  OH MY GOD!!! The people hanging in the village at 2am was crazy. Christopher street was packed. This one bar " Henrietta Hudson " was LOADED with people. Mind you, it was a full blown lesbian bar, but lesbian or not, some of these women were beautiful.  I get back to my car. I realized something. I have been part of something only on the business side. I never really sat and socialized with them on a personal level. It kinda gave me a new found hope that things aren't really that bad as I thought.  Picked up the gimp and drove home locally and made some drive by's around some local places.   I got home and parked in the parking lot and as of this moment, I owe them 10 bucks, I am leaving it there for the full 24 hours to get my ten bucks worth.  I am suppose to go out today but it seems that my house will see me for most of the night. Plans have changed and I am glad that they did. I feel better today. I think that is a good thing.  Tomorrow, the fitting of the TUXES!!!! It should be fun. We are going to lunch afterwards and it should be cool.  Another note : I think the outake on Porno's are the funniest things in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   You see things like: 1   Oops, I am sorry I poked you in the eye 2    "I forgot my line "  ( WHAT lines are really needed in porn )   Ok, have a good day  Peace, love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       I thought I was done for the day   Well,  11:00am to 1:30pm lunch hour and this is what happens...........  11 to 12 was a waste of my fucking time...   Not the point..... I walk..........headed to Central Park to clear my head that has been quite volatile lately. I walk into this park that is the greatest park in NYC. I feel strangely out of place. I feel like if I don't belong. Beautiful lake with at least 30 Mallard ducks staying in the shade. This caught me for a loop because the way I think of ducks as always swimming back and forth in the water. Along side the ducks, several pigeons. They seemed so happy to just stay in the shade with not one worry in the world. I still feel out of place. I walk......  ........ along this path and I sat on the bench that was dedicated to " Anne Marie " from Marie and Joe. The spot where it seemed that no one wanted to sit was the bench I chose. In front of me, three little old ladies drawing on canvass. Seeing them draw and converse amongst themselves was enjoying. They seem to take their art as their life and in looking at them, I saw myself enjoying the art that I was gifted with. With every stroke of the old ladies hands, I attached a word to that stroke. I used words like " soft, gentle, assuring ". With every moment that she stopped in order to see her work being born, I used words like " Happy, accomplished, meaning ". I was writing to their work and I felt truly......... inspired. I felt at peace. I felt like I finally  know what I am. Without even realizing it, the struggling writer was born in the backdrop of Central Park with three little old ladies being my light at the end of a confused tunnel. Such desire to make perfection with their strokes, my words are " my " perfection. Words are " My " life. I shed a tear. in central park being alone and thinking, I cry.  Why? I wish I could say. I just want things better around me. I can only carry just so much positivity.  June 27th 2003...... Welcome to the world, Fish, the writer.  ummmmmm........ I am kinda sorry for being somewhat judgemental of certain people. If I have brushed you the wrong way lately, I am sorry.  This weekend will be my weekend where decisions will be made. I can't procrastinate no longer.   Tuesday's blog will be one to remember......  Have a great weekend.  Peace, Love,  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       This is sad........   The fact that I am at work and I feel more comfortable then being at home. Ok, most of you know me as a strong Puerto Rican man that is in total spiritual connectivity with his heritage and roots. Now, if hating the hot weather doesn't make me Boricua, pound the gavel and declare me guilty.  So many people were complaining about the rain and cold weather, now , mother nature is blasting us with heat from hell. I am convinced that mother nature has connection with the devil, this heat doesn't come from her, it has to be directly borrowed from hell.  Well, Since I spent most of the night awake, I did soo much thinking. I tried to keep the cup half full but that is proving hard for me.  I have to hit rock bottom one of these days in order to progress. I have this tendency of being stuck in Purgatory. For instance, my poetry is kinda stuck in limbo. I am workshopping and reading to better myself and I know this is going to take time.  I have seen some differences even from my uppercase until now. I was looking at the tape and you can see that things are changing. My voice is still the same but my style has slowed down. I also am not screaming at the top of my lungs. That kinda took away from the pieces that I was dropping.   This weekend should be a good weekend. Saturday is my best Friends Birthday. I have to go spoil her as she always takes care of me for my birthday. She brought me a filter for my tank and that was kinda big since them things are expensive as hell. So, Seems like a dinner and whatever she wants to shop for seems to be in order. She mentioned Diamond earrings, should I or shouldn't I ? LOL.  We see.  Sunday I wanted to hang out at this BBQ but seems that will not happen. The dreaded fitting of the Tuxedo's is this Sunday. I am goinng to look like a fat Puerto Rican penguin. I have to do it for my dawgs wedding. My nigga E is getting married. I am soo happy for his little ass.  I have to awlays say this, that motherfucker is hands down the best brotha I know. He is hardworking, loyal, smart, and has a giving side that will not even come close to anything else. He is a great pop to his little man and I respect him for that. It is going to be good to see him finally getting this marriage thing done. I was thinking about writing some beautiful poetic shit to say at his wedding. Yet, what can I say that is not already in the heart. Why write it to try and remember it later ?? If it came from the heart today, it should be there later.  Today is a good day. Tomorrow is another endeavor that I am doing to better myself. I hope things change, as of now, not many people will be too happy with me.  Note: If you page me, my pager is off until next week. A backlog at the company won't let me have my pager connected into later next week.  All this on this blog and I primarily didn't say shit. Yep. it's a bad day.  Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       Need I complain???   Ok, I sign on to post this blog and they changed the format and I almost screamed. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ???? I hate change.  Ok, it is 6:00am and I am typing. This means that it was hot last night and I ddin't sleep worth one nickel. I have an AC but I hate them things. Give me my fan and I am happy.  Anyway, last night I was flicking through the TV and I caught a new show on Playboy. It is kinda like a Candid camera tye of show but the pranks are hilarious. I caught this one prank and I laughed throughout.  They had three unsuspecting dudes take part in a study abot how men get turn on with certain stimuli. They put this thing on the guys. It was kinda like what boxers wear to protect their genital area. It was connected to some wires which went to this machine with a dial from 0.0 to 10.0. In front of the guys was a revolving pedestal with different stimuli.  First experiment was one girl naked just moving around and the machine would go up to a 4 or 5. Then they had two girls and they got really sexy and the machine went up to a 6 or 7. Ok, this wasn't that funny. When they brought out the fat dude that was slightly balding and no where near packing. This was OVER THE TOP. The guys were all seemingly uncomfortable. They tried not to look and the guy got on the revolving pedestal. The machine started beeping and going crazy. It read 10 plus. The guy taking the study told the dudes taking the study that they were gay. I thought I was going to die. I was laughing so hard here at home and I couldn't get over that.  So, I hope that you people stay nice and cool. Don't die in this heat.  I will post something else when I get to work. I am actually in one of those profound intellectual moods.  Peace

       where is my tiramisu?  Good morning ladies and gentleman,  I am here in the job and everything is great. I feel good and I actually slept last night. As hot as it was, my hot sweaty naked body was comfortable as hell and I slept like a baby. Once you get that nasty visual out of your mind about me being naked ( and stop laughing ), I will proceed with this unusual rant.  Ok, here it is, my birthday was on January 7th of this year. I know, it was a while back already. Some of my best buds took me to Peter Luger's, My parents cooked dinner for me, the sweetest friend I have brought me a filter for my fishtank, even one person spoiled me rotten with clothing and what not.  Here is the thing ( LOL ) This motherfucker offered me a dinner and I am still waiting. Then, THE MOTHERFUCKER offered me some tiramisu ( Italian desert ) and I am still waiting!!!!!!  I am shouting him out on this e-mail!!!!!  Ok, here goes.....   Until I get my tiramisu, I will harass him and become the cyber terrorist that I am.  Here is what I will do.....  Today, no information will be conveyed.  Every week, I will post something to the internet to make his life miserable.  So.......  First comes: Phone number Cell number Address Mother's phone number Mother's address ( She gives great ......let me stay shut )  I will post every embarassing moment of this lackies life and have everyone call him until he gets me my tiramisu YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!  Then, if that doesn't work, I will post the most sensitive moments in his life..  ie: Like the time when we got locked up and they called his mother and he fainted. Like a little bitch, he fainted and the cop caught him.  Want more???  Oh... I GOT PLENTY!!!!  He is probably saying, " I don't care, this shit won't phase me ". well, you know what, I have that tendency of not giving up until I get mines  So...  Here is the first tidbit  Name: Wilfred Martinez Employer: Dairyland  Tomorrow...... The social Security number, Phone number and address.  Where is my TIRAMISU?    YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       it's that time   Laptop literally on the lap..........................check 2 liter bottle of ice cold Pepsi.....................check Channel 59 gratuitous porno.......................check a MIND FILLED WITH OODLES OF NONSENSE.........CHECK Fingers itching to write it all down................check ( x 7 ) :)  Ok, so I am home and I have just returned from another incredibly fullfilling Acentos. Can I even explain how happy I was today?? I will try to the best of my ability.  I would take the liberty of writing this in a format suitable for the mass of viewers in our Acentos group. Yet, I will write this with my own personal flare and ghetto tinge. Shit was off the hook today. Don't get me wrong, I had fun as soon as I stepped into the Blue Ox bar. The feature was already there and we really connected talking about teaching and our conjoined and common love for our ghetto of the Bronx. The open mic was prety good and we had a decent mix of newbies and regular's. We are getting people coming from all over the place to grace our mic. People are coming from Downtown and a girl came from her school in a cab to try and get there on time. She had an old Bonafide flyer and that shit meant that my flyering is getting to the masses.  Our feature was fucking awesome. I really was into most of his set. I was digging it because he brought hs poetry with a fuckin vengence!! He dropped it and kept his own personal energy unabated. With a back up of two guitars and the occasional Majimbe ( drum for you dumb fucks ) his set proved to be my most favorite so far. I mean, I felt him being ttaly genuine on his front about how much he loved Acentos.  Everyone that comes through loves what we have put together. Oscar is doing his thing and keeping the hosting very perosnal between him and the audience, you know what, I would say don't do it, but it works and it keeps people coming back. He is doing his thing and I am proud of his ass.   So, I was venting today and I have soooooooooo much to say. Yet, revealing shit would go against alot of what I stand for. Yet, I could say some things in general.  I did this once and I got respect for it, I say this now.....................  " If you do not like me in any which way, call me and tell me ( 718-547-3823 ), I will then keep my distance from you and you better keep yours from mines. "  I say this because I am getting kinda fed up with hypocrisy and nonsense. I show my love to everyone that is in my inner circle. If I don't talk to you, I don't like you. It is simple. If I don't like something you do, I wil tell you, we will work it out, and we keep on walking.  Things are getting done differently then what I thought in certain areas of my life. I try to understand but it is really bothering me that things are getting done in only one way and no other way. Even if they seem vehemently bogus, they still need to try something different that will work. I understand that everything in life is a " try and see if we succeed " attitude. Yet, it just bothers me when life is shit and they sprinkle sugar on the shit and try to sell it to the masses as if it is sugar filled. Uh, it is still shit if you ask me.  Try and read in betwen the lines and you will get a headache. Try to get it out of me, I will tell you.   The best part of the evening was this...........  A part of one of my poems says " You got pito, puto, and papito and a whole bunch of other " P " nicknames ". Today, I saw Puto, I missed that guy so much. He is doing well and we kicked it as if he and I were hanging everyday.  Just being on the block for 20 minutes has given me so much incentive to write. Alot of the guys are really happy and even proud of me for writing. They know that this is a story that I will get out to the masses. I feel like edward james olmos in Mi Familia. He was a struggling writer that wanted to make it big. Since I am struggling, I just need the writer part to come to life. I really do miss my old block, them Kats were the very meaning of what I was and what I became, a man. I became a man in the company of the hardest thugs in NYC. Tony was there and I haven't seen him since I graduated High School. That is 13 years my freind. We spoke like we just saw each other yesterday.  OK, I have written enough nonsense with no format at all. I write like aI think, just crazy.  This leather couch in the top floor apartment is proving that it was FUCKING hot Today.  k, Had a great convo with someone that has the balls to do something ad is not afraid to say what is on his mind. With this being said, that is the defiition of a revolutionary. That is not keeping it real. That is the truth coming out of the mouth. Too many people are afraid to say the truth. When the ydo say the truth, they are afraid of hurting feelings. I call it as I see it. The calm serene lake will be rippled beyond repair if shit doesn't get rectified. Peace, Love  Great porno on  Fish  >)))">

        You are the long-sabered, well-spoken Fish Windu, one of the most powerful Jedi on the Louder council.  Though you're devoted to doing good Louder deeds, at heart you're a bad muthatrucka. and secretly want to fuck Roger up.  Though it's never discussed in the movies, chances are you get mad ladies.  It's no coincidence that your light-saber is a special color and is extra-long.

        Who we be? I be, we be, you be, fuck the booshwazi!!!!!!   Well, here is my blog for today. I am back at the JOB and I feel good. I am doing my thing and life is good. I actually got a really good night's sleep last night. Why??? Simple. I got soooo aggravated last night that I hit the " FUCK it " mark. I got home and didn't think about shit and I slept quite well.  Last night was our womenEDGE format to the evening and Mara Jebson was the feature. Let me go to the evening and how it went.   Good evening with about 60 people in attendance. Our host for the evening was Syreeta McFadden. Clearly, as she declared this her  " Virgin hosting " adventure, she actually did good for her first time. She was a little nervous and you can tell. She did her thing and I actually would look forward to seeing her host again after more practice runs. The open mic was decent last night. The highlight of the evening was the Escalon family coming out strong. Roberto Escalon ( Currently a member of the National Seattle team ) read a homage for his mother and he was strong. Lisa read and as usual, she is awesome. Something about that girl gives off the sense that she is beyond genuine. Her heart is warm and just talking to her can brighten a brothers day. The highlight now??? Momma Escalon was there and she read on the open mic. This part would have even made a shitty mic go over to greatness.  It was time to bring our feature up and it was her time to shine. I was pretty happy to see her feature for the simple fact that I uppercased with her last November ( I am living through her ). She got up there and she went through her poems. She was very very nervous and it seeped through her pores.  When she learns to relax and not rush through, she will be an awesome feature. Until then, she was pretty good.  Following her Mara was a question and answer by Ginna. I wasn't digging this part that much. Ginna asked very generic questions and I didn't get a feel about Mara at all. I wanted more personal questions. I have seen Roger, Guy, Oscar, and Ginna run Q & A. I have to make ripples and say that Oscar kicked ass in the Q & A session. I want to feel that I know the poet on a personal level after a q & a. I honestly don't care what they reading,  how they revise and edit poems. Maybe one question was asked that was decent and that was the relationship between Mara and her Mom ( the storyteller ). Besides that, I could have gone without the Q & A.  Now, the bout of the night.......Lynne Procope -vs - Dawn Saylor....... Need I say who won??? Of course.....  Lynne Procope took it hands down. I was aggravated to the 7th level after the bout ( for reasons that I won't display here ). So I didn't pay the results any mind. Lynne won the bout and that is pretty much making Louder " the pimp slapping big brothers of Urbana". Does this make Louder better??? not really. I am sure that if the next bout was to take place in Urbana, it would be a different story.   So, I am itching to write about sooooo much but I don't have time. I just want to relax and hope that things will run smoother down the road. I am aiming for right after nationals, the atmosphere should be more laid back.  At this time, it better. I am concentrating on many other avenues to better myself and I don't need aggravation. First and foremost, I am a writer. I realized this when I would just love to sit down and create something with words. I am still a poet, I am just making the umbrella of " writer " solid in my life. I love poetry and it has made me and paved the way for many other things. Yet, I am a writer.  I will do much and much will do me...... I just hope I could keep up with it.  LOL  Ok, to all my people..... I hope the bullshit stops. My tolerance is low.  I love ya like a piece of ham on a Sunday morning.

       Sometimes I just wonder..........   Well, I finally got enough thoughts in order to Blast " THe Hulk " as intellectual as possible. You see, last night when I got home, if I would have entered a blog, it would have read like this.......... " The Hulk was a piece of shit movie and I wasted my time!!!!!!!!!!". Yet, I waited to let the anger subside until today and enter a review of what I thought the movie was lacking.  Well, The movie was different. It had things hat I never even remotely seen done in other movies. Let me get to the Best parts of the movie.  Great transitioning between scenes. It was very " Comic Bookish " Some split scenes were pretty cool to give you an idea or perspectives from different camera angles The special effects of course wre awesome. The hulk character at first seemed so fake and you teneded to forget that throughout his appearances.   What was bad......... I am saying the the storyline was good but the delivery was bland. You needed a much need extra boost to keep you interested in the context and what they were trying to make you believe.   What I felt was most lacking were the scores in the movie and the music buildup. We have to face facts, a movie with an awesome buildup of music will put an average movie over the edge. The fast and the furious would have been garbage with opera as the main scores.   The movie really didn't do it for me and I hope that all of you comic book fans won't dismiss this movie that fast. Maybe you all will love it. The common feeling through out the movie theater ( all 5 of us  was dissappointment ). I got to see a super late screening at 2:30am with just some employees.    I guess I can't complain that much, I didn't pay for the movie so why beef? I just figure that if  did pay for it, I would have entered that first blog.  Ok, be good  Peace, Love  Take care  fish  >)))">

       Should I or Shouldn't I?   The weekend falls upon us and I am torn between 15 different things to do. I wanted to go to this Poetry reading tonight but I think it is going to be about 4 million people trying to audition to get on DEF poetry Jam. That is certainly not something I am interested in doing if it just all about that.  If I had my Cd's with me, I could go and maybe just pump them suckers like the mad pimp that I am.  So, tonight looks like I will jsut go and do my own thing. I was suppose to go out to dinner tomorrow with a freind of mines but things got complicated and I have to turn down any invites with precursor's.    on July 3rd is my first day at Bedford Hills and I can't make it because of this Darf Future slam. I really don't want to miss it. That is going to suck. I have to call and tell them that a slam has taken priority over teaching, I bet my life is going straight down hill after that.  Well, I am staying away from everybody this weekend. So, just let me be and I will catch all of you on Monday. I am going to see a therapists Monday so be ready to hear some brand new revelations in my life. IF this motherfucker doesn't help, alot of unhappy people will come to be.  Time to go  Have a great weekend.  Peace, Love  Take care  >)))">

       Why Sweet Savior of ours.......... WHY!!!   I am back at home and I proceed to enter this blog basically disgusted with what I saw. Easily the worst poetry of any venue in NYC. Tonight was the bedeviled " Grudge " slam at the Bowery Poetry club. Some teams from Cambridge Mass, Texas, Chicago and no where else that really matters because the night was garbage to say the least. Not everyone sucked ass, yet, I will give you a quick overview.....  First Round for the night: Indigo: 24.9 RAC:24.7 Cristin:27.0 Etan:20.9  In this round, Indigo came and dropped a pretty decent piece. It was somewhat drab but the score showed the poem was a bit too montone. RAC came on and she dropped a good piece and it was her " a ' game as far as I could see. Cristin came with a new piece and as the Loose Cannon that she is, she got the high score to win the first round. Etan dissappointed me big time. I heard so much about him and he didn't seem as good as others made him out to be. I guess those midwesterners love his style  Second round Jeff: 23.0 Celena:24.3 Morris: 20.3 Bingo:21.7  Jeff got up there and dropped a prety political piece and he got a 23.0 that was the average of the evening. Celena did a page piece and it was different from what I am used to seeing her do. Now, Morris. You all know that I am the most " devil's advocate " abiding motherfucker out there. This little balding bastard dropped some bullshit. I had this guy up there with the people that push the envelope, and he drops some raucous non-classy garbage that shouldn't even have been written. There was no purpose what so ever to his poem . If I was Asian, I would have punched him in the face. I know, I know, it is just poetry, yet, drop something worthy on the stage and not some clear stupid shit. I won't waste my time on Bingo. This little old man that is about two steps from death and all I remeber is him saying " kiss my piss ".   Third Round Post Midnight: 27.0 Joel:25.0 Adam:24.1 Shappy:24.4  Post midnight came in first in this round with his 6 : 45 minute piece about his love and awe for bacon. I now tat everyone from urbana dropped a new piece for the evening except Post, doesn't he have any more poetry in his arsenal? Did he and was he the only one that went against a Bowery Motto of using New Poetry ??? Who knows. Yet, his diatribe about his amorous obsession with Bacon won out. Joel dropped a good piece and Shappy was typical greatass Shappy!!! fourth Round Krystal: 24.2 Star: 24.3 Tony:27.2 Shawn:25.4  The fourth Round saw this sexy diva named Tony give it her all and really bring in the best score for the night. Star did a group piece with Adam and it was very well rehearsed. Shawn came in with a new poem and actually threw me for a loop. I was expecting a freestyle but the poem he read seemed really new. He didn't win this round so that is something to take into account.   So, Urbana took this grudge match hands down with no competition at all. If thi grudge match is a pre-cursor to what is going to happen in nationals, I swear to the almighty fuckin dollar that I am bringing some profound shit next year.  Ok, let me write about myself. I went to the Bowery to get on the open mic to get a feel for their stage. I never did a piece there before. turns out that I was the first victim from the corporation and I had to do my piece while my hands were tied behind my back. Today, I brought new meaning to the phrase, " I now this poem so well that I could do it with my hands tied behind my back. I did the piece and dropped it perfect. I left out the last stanza to give them something new the day of the slam. I loved the way Taylor Mali comes after I finished to remove the cuffs but I already picked them and removed them. I walked off the stage and I was really feeling the vibe at Bowery. I could barely see the faces looking back so I couldn't really get distracted by anything.  Ok, back to this grudge slam. What got me pissed mostly was the bad influx of poetry that came from some of the best people on the scene. I have seen Morris feature and I am aware and KNOW that he could have dropped something better then that. I have no clue who adam Stone is and after he dropped his poem dissing Saul Williams, I won't even bother.  If you need to spend your energy on dissing another poet, I won't hold you too much in  regard. That is just how I see it.   ok, now more or less my anger is subsiding. I was realy expecting some great poetry tonight and I got served with some half ass shit. The only thing that is good here is that Urbana kicked their collective asses. I hope nationals will not be a waste of my time. I am a football player and I adopt the WIN mentality to ANY competition I do!!!!!! I am not bringing something half ass to even risk losing. Then that would give motherfuckers the opportunity to talk shit down the road. Fuck that, Bring that shit or stay home. Every time I get on that Mic, I bring 110 Percent!!!!!! I work hard off the mic to make sure that when I do get up there, I am doing the best that I can. If it doesn't go my way in the way of winning, I just work harder off the mic. It is not all about winning but If I am in something where I could win, I am going for it.   Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       ******** Machismo Redefined Review straight from the NUYO**********   Hello people, I just got home from handing out over 300 flyers for Acentos. I wasn't just going to he NUYORICAN to support my Poetic brethren, I was plugging our venue like the  mad publicist that I am.   Well, Today, June 18, 2003 was the debut of Machismo Redefined. The main participants of this interestingly thrown together accomplishment were Fred Feliciano, Nathan P, Chance, Crow. From the looks of that last sentence, Fred needs a nickname to really be in sync with the rest of the cast. I got there several seconds after the opening credits ( open mic'ers ) . So writing a review about the two that I saws would be a waste of my time.  The show finally opened up with some good cued music, I would have paid attention to the music but I started reviewing later then I would have wanted to.   The show opens with Freddy getting on the mic and traditionally getting ready to open the show. An audience member which was a female started heckling Freddy and you immediately knew it was a skit. It was actually pretty funny and even somewhat genuine. Crow comes in and tries to calm the audience member down then chance basically tells her to " Shut up and sit down " . They all go to describe ( with their own personal poems) what machismo really is to them. One by one, they poeticize the reasoning for Machismo redefined.  After this, Chance was the first Poet/ Comedian/ host/ whatever te hell he was doing up there. He drops some of his poems and he was really zoning. He was nervous but he used it to his advantage. He dropped one piece that he said was very personal to him but the sensitivity of the piece was lost when he had to describe it. Te piece could have been a tear jerker but it still needed more. He makes such a great comeback with the hosting experience that he has honed over the past several months. He was  energetic and contolled the crowd with his humor and quick wit. He deemed it appropiate to drop his signature " Chuchi the fakass Puerto Rican " Piece. I have to say that this young kat has worked hard to twist that piece into what it is today. I would not want to go up against that piece in a slam. It was a diamond in the rough and he has finally polished it and has his signature piece gleaming with a close to perfect rendition of it. Kudos to Chance  Crow enters for the second feature set. I have never seen crow before so this was his opportunity to give a great first impression on me.Most likely he will never read this but hey, let me think.... He drops a poem about " with great dick comes great responsibility". He had a good comedic strength  and it went hand in hand with the machismo redefined motto. At one point, I was lost. I wsn't aware if he was doing a poem or freestyling or something. Then he dropped " the greatest apology you never saw ". It definitely fell in the confines of the message they were trying to convey. The poem was good and it might have been just a tad too complex but the message was well received throughout the audience. A decent piece followed by comedy might have killed it for me but this was working well and getting laughs. He ends his set with a skit that turns into a really good poem. It was about his wife and even though it was somewhat of a weak start, it was an extremely strong finish.  Freddy makes his entrance and I knew something was wrong with him from the start. His voice wasn't nearly as strong as his normal Fred feliciano way. At this point, I am wondering how many times he will say " Cock ". I have always liked Freddy and his poetry is " Different " . Today, I have realized what Freddy is, he is a hands down Spoken word Comedian. I respect him for that. He does things that I can't do.   As soon as he gets on stage he starts off so well and says " give it up for me, I have a big ego ". That was funny as fuck. Probably the best line of the night. He proceeds to drop his good piece " Cock on Ice " I lost count of how many times he said cock. I have seen Freddy many times so the shock valuewasn't really there for me. Yet, with lines like " If I was able to suck my own cock, I will swallow ", it does has an essential moment that makes you go " damn " .The crowd was loving it and I was not suprised. Freddy caters to the regular crowd that laughs at most of he things he says. A poem can say cock 4 times in a comedic context and you will win over the crowd. Say it 56 times and you might win over the world. I personally won't do it that wasy but hey, to each their own. He is there and starts another piece and says that this is a serious one. He sets the crowd up and does his thing. Freddy Proceeds to drop another piece " I am the Jacques Cousteau of pussy eating ". This had everyone pretty much laughing and gigging on the endless stacks and stacks of metaphoric descriptions on how Freddy eats pussy.  With Lines like " I am a mild mannered Human resources Manager by day, at night, I am ( enter superhero them music here ) ............ PUSSY MAN!!! More lines like " My Cock the supervillian still kils me.   Another skit enters as Freddy finishes his piece. Nathan P acts as Maury Povich and sitting there was Freddy and Tanya. Freddy was there to get the results of a DNA test to prove if he was the fater of a child or not. It was a great skit to lead into  his last piece " men Suffer too ". I was very impressed on several fronts with Freddy's set and this poem. He left me with a newfound hope that one day, he wil not say " COCK ". His set was great and I have to say that his impression was strong. Regardless of how raspy his throat sounded, he did well.  Nathan  goes up and I have heard him before. I heard he was an excellendt poet and he lived up to that expectation. His choice of words and context were pretty strong. He horded some comedy and had great presence on the stage.   So, all out review of Machismo redefined goes like this........  The show was very different and I have to applaud these artist that have gotten together to pull this off. The house was packed as if it was a Friday night slam. They all delivered great poems for the show. The nerves were running pretty wild with these gys trying to pull this off. It was still well worth the time and I would recommend it to the person willing to appreciate some comedy, a comfortable setting.  This by far was no where near a Broadway production but it certain was worthy of the NUYO. The brainchild behind this was freddy and it could explain alot of the messages that were said ths evening. Most messages were..... simple. Men are going to change. They are nt going to be the typical man that eveyone sees.   Great crowd, good show  3.5 out of 5 from me.  Don't expect life changng poetry of performances but it was great to go see.  Time to go   Fish

       Why here ?????   Well, here is the thing ( as Oscar always says ). I come to work every morning and I am eternally in a good mood. I am always smiling and just happy to read my paper. Yet, it is the most fragile good mood known to man. It could get shattered in mere seconds with any number of circumstances. ie: Loud ass woman heading to the welfare office beefing!!! Loud ASS KIDS!!! Some third world immigrant cutting his nails, the hardcore thug trying to rap out loud. Anything that involves a disturbance to my little world entrapped in a subway bubble bothers me.  This morning, this motherfucker gets on the train and starts with his shit, What was it?? From 205th street until my stop, he was talking about....... ( drumroll )............. Our Lord and savior Jesus Christ!!! Oh man, I was pissed. Then, he wasn't really preaching, he was more like screaming and yelling " accept the Lord and savior Jesus Christ into your life " . I am telling you, he must have known that I have different beliefs.   I have nothing against the regular joe's preaching anything, yet, isn't there a thing called " Church "? If I wanted to find God, I know where to go. If I wanted to go to any organized relegion, I know where to turn. I don't need my train turned into a moving house of worship. I see people trying to spread the word of their religion and it kills me. I respect you, but don't agitate me early in the morning.   Then, you ever had a good Sunday morning sleep disturbed by some Jehovah's Witnesses knocking early on your door?? Oh man, I hate that. Then, when you answer the door, some of them are kinda cute. I normally just open the door in my boxers and then they just leave and never come back. It works well actually. You have to be fat like me to do it though. If you are one of those hard rock fabio types, they will never leave your door unknocked.  Last night was a good night..... I headed to Poetry Hill where Chance was Late as fuck. I was about to go to Jimmy's uptown but the $15 dollar cover surely kept me from going there. I love poetry but not for 15 dollars to sit and be a loyal spectator. The open mic was pretty cool yesterday. I had a hell of a time joking around and busting Chance's chops. On the Open Mic was Shadagga, Chance, Henry ( The Ultimate Boricua ), Kevin, BopdeBop ( This kid is going to be crazy when he gets older ). Chance and I did " our want to be famous piece and we screwed up royally, talk about funny. I then did my Apocalypse piece and everything was good. Butterfly soul was the feature for the night and we had a good time just joking around.  It was a getaway last night and I didn't have to deal with any drama , it felt good.  Ok  Time to bounce  Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       This is weird   Ok, I just got home from the " Almost Failed Venue " of Poetry Hill. I won't shout them out because I actually had a good time and the feature was one of my favorites.  Ok, for two nights in a row, I have been coming home late and have noticed something that is really out of the ordinary. I know that for most of my life, birds tend to go to sleep at night just like we do. As soon as night falls, all birds pick their respective trees and you don't hear a peep ( literally ) until the crack of dawn. So the the past two nights I have walked home and heard birds in the middle of the night as if the sun was shining strong.   The thing is, the slightest thing could mean something far bigger. Who knows what those birds chiping in the middle of the night are trying to say. Is it a warning? Is it fear ? Is it a batch of retarded birds that think the street lamp is the sun? I don't know, but my pellet gun is getting dusted off tomorrow if those little motherfuckers don't shut those beaks!!!!!!!!!!!  PEACE, LOVE  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       Best Monday I have had in a while   Well, Monday comes and goes and I always tend to reflect Tuesday morning.  Louder Monday was the usual string of confusion and Organized chaos at the beggining until the flow was established. I was kinda pissed at the start of the evening because if you say you are going to do something during the day, that takes priority over rehearsal and all the other mierda. You want to rehearse, do it at home, the train, before you get there. I am a worker and when I say I am going to do something, I am going to do it and do it 100%. I am not half assing. I see alot of that and it is really upsetting. Now, other then that....... The night was really good. The format was  urlLink LouderJAM  with  urlLink Elana Bell  hosting. I had a feeling she was going to actually just do well. She actually impressed me and did pretty good. She was talking too much shit up there but regardless, she did well. I told her at the end of the night, she did well.   The open mic was really decent with a couple of stragglers making it for a good evning. THe highlight of the open mic was a certain " newbie " reading a poem for the first time. The poem was said to be " the best poem of the night. The newbie you ask?? It was Lenny. Good ol Lenny read a poem and it was nothing more but extremely heartfelt. It was a gushing of emotions of how we came to be. She declared her love on stage and the best poets in the house came to her telling her that she was awesome. THat is what happens aftr 9 months of hearing poetry, YOU BETTER BE GOOD AT WRITING IT.!    " Congrats ma , I was very happy to see you up there "  I was talking to several people about trying to get them to do the 2nd installment of the Rikers showcase. I have some good people and I am waiting for some confirmations. Once July 3rd comes around, I am going to know for sure who will be doing their thing. If you are not there , you are going to miss one hell of a show.  I had to talk to Mr Shawn Randall about some topics that I wrote about several weeks ago on the blog. No biggie, " Shawn, I will catch you on the rebound " IF anything, leave your peace in the guestbook BRotha!!!!!  LOL  The Faith Project was really something of interest. It is combining different religions and putting all under the same umbrella of " Faith ". They did a small snippet last night and of course, I didn't see anything that embraces my Faith, but it was good. I might actually finally support them and see what this is all about.  Time to bounce, be good  Peace, Love  *********  This is the poem that was read to me last night, via Lenny. **********  Finding Love Through Poetry  Sept. 28, 2002 That was the day that was destined to change my life.  A clear and Sunny day it was Looking to expand my horizons was my purpose Poetry was the calling And corneliaís was the place Not a Poet myself, but a listener  Alcohol still running through my veins from the night before In early celebration of the day I was born To my surprise, this was the day I met my Love. The funny part, was that I didnít even know it. Not yet formally introduced and not knowing what to expect He recites  His voice, powerful and captivating I was overwhelmed by the words flowing from his lips Wow! Was what I felt I will never forget that performance  As days went by.. HeÖ.Filled with interest and IÖFilled with confusion and Fear Fear of getting my heart broken Not knowing which direction to take, Rejection was all I knew to give  and each time I rejected,  my heart said I was wrong for doing so  A few months and 4 chances later, which were given to me I had in my arms a man who treated me like a queen Unfamiliar territory it was to me Was this Real? Was all I thought Or was this another trick that life was playing on me One to add to my many days of pain and disappointments But noÖ.This time I was proven wrong He WAS different And IÖ.. Was sure.. All I wanted was to love and be loved and here was that chance  A man more perfect I couldnít ask for A man perfect for me that is He opened doors that I never knew existed and for this I thank him He gave me new hope that led me to believe that There were still a few good men left in this world Now, I was privileged to say I had me a good man!  December 25th was the happiest day The day I was asked to be his officially As scared, nervous, and happy thoughts ran through my mind I said yesÖ.  My prince had finally arrived A man, intimidating to others But a different man I knew One who was warm, respectful, Affectionate, loving, kind, giving, and Patient Was the man I knew and grew to care for and love Happy days followed And now, I donít want those days to ever end  A strong bond has been built between us One that makes him a part of me as much as I am a part of him  Who knew I would find love through poetry Who knew that the man I would end up loving Was a man named FishÖ.

       It's MONDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Good Monring my dearest folks!!!!!! I am back in the job and doing my thing. A great weekend if I have to say so. I say this because I am alive. I thought I was going to die with this Ebola in my system. I got over it and I feel good.  Not  much to really report or say. I kinda stood low yesterday and went out later in the evening. I was mostly watching " real TV " yesterday and the things that people catch on video is amazing. I have realized what bothers me the most. I have seen alot of things in my life and I know that almost nothing bothers me.   Gunshots, Stab wounds, Car crashes, hangings, Train running people over, people jumping off the roof, drowning, none of this bothers me.  Now, this is the funny thing, you know when you see a waterbug and you step on it and ot makes that pop sound. Then when a bone breaks , it makes that " snap" sound.This is what kills me. The sounds !!!!! I hear a bone brreak and I get all wiggy. I realized this yesterday. The bones start going in a weird direction, visually, I don't care. I hear the bones snap, and I am like .... UGH!!!  Weird huh.  LOL  peace  >)))">

       Comics, a gated community and a grill   So, I am finally getting over this ebola virus that was killing me. I have no clue if it was a cold or a flu but it took serious toll on me. Yesterday, I had to go to an open house and a workshop and I didnít make nether.  I stood home in the bed until 4pm.  When I did roll out of bed, I made my way to meet up with Eric and Mike to head to PA. We had to go out there to drop off Ericís collection of comics. So, for all you comic book enthusiasts out there, I handled over 15 boxes of comics from the early 70ís. This dude must have spent every fuckin penny of his allowance when he was young on Comics.  The ride out there was cool because we took Mikeís van and it was comfy as a cloud in heaven. I was loving the seats. It was like a recliner in a vehicle.  We got to the community and we had to get approval from Ericís MOM to go into the community. It was like a little piece of safe and secure heaven on earth. One thing, it was hill after twist and turn. It was crazy.  When we were headed out there, Eric called the mom and she started getting the grill ready. So after we had all the comics in the spare room. We started cooking the steaks. She diddnít buy the bootleg steaks neither. She got some official Chuck steaks and the BBQ was a blessing. We ate, and ate, and ate.   Great food and a greater time.  Coming home I was aggravated because I was calling somebody and they didnít pick up. I am a worrier but everything turned out ok.  Came home and regardless of being sick, it was a good day to be with Eric. I had a great time and I actually feel better today.  I know, nothing to detailed and it is all general, but hey, thatís life when you sick.  My little Ginna and Jayme is sick I hope they get better.   Get better guys.  Peace Love  Take care,  Fish  >)))î>

       These are the weird things I think about   ok.....Dirty Blog today.  Why is it as a man that is an avid Porno watcher, the remote and my finger on the fast forward button go hand in hand? Till this day, I don't know anybody, female or male, that sits down and watches four hours of straight porn. It is usually is spurts of 20 - 30 mins.  After that, off  goes the VCR and you are done for the day.  I remember my first experience with watching porn. I was in Puerto Rico and a cousin of mines was single and oned over 200 pornos. Now, I am not kidding, he had over two hundred flicks. He had them all mixed up with his regular movies. So his blood and mines run in the same veins so we never even napped. We broke night and about 8 in the morning he fell asleep. I went through his flicks and just popped in another tape and on comes this dude and this chic.I was about 15 and I had no idea what was going on.  No matter what I SAW IN pLAYBOY AND SPOKE TO THE FELLAS ABOUT IT, YOU ARE STILL shocked when you see it. Now, I am looking at them just pounding away and I see something kinda strange. The chic is also packing. Now I am like, ok, I am not that dumb but I thought women did not pack. That chic actually is packing ( she hung too ). Ok, now picture me looking at the TV , head cocked sideways, wondering what the hell is going on. Then, of course, I turned it off because I didn't want my cousin catching me. I go catch some z's and I am confused. Next night..........  I go pop in the tape and made sure I rewind that sucker to the beggining. Who ever recorded the movie started from a quarter through. So , I couldn't see it from the start. Ok, so getting the title will not help. Let me see, I start watching it again and the same chic pops up. So I think, maybe is a dude with long hair and the guy is catching wreck on her anal. Another camera angle and the it wasn't anal. Now, I am really confused. With that confusion comes fear. Are all girls like this ??? Is there a deep dark worldwide secret that no one mentioned to me? The dude has her ( or it as I refer to the chic ) in the spooning position and she starts stroking her meat. I lost it when some shot something out of her meat. Turned off the porno and didn't touch a girl until I was 18!!!! Till this day, I am still a little bit scared at that who thing. Was she a trans sexual??? nope. She was a hermerphrodite. The wonderful people that have the best of both worlds. Damn, don't be making porno's and fucking kids heads up though.  That was my first porn experience. After that, years of careful research. I now make sure that the porno is worth my eyeballs. Of course, with that being said, I came across two brand new ones in a box last night at a friends spot. He was getting rid of them so I took. They are old as hell. Nothin says humor like two white people with Mullets ( old hair do's ) fucking. Nothing says humor like seeing Ron Jeremy weighing 140 pounds ( he weighs about 230 lbs now ).   Is porn bad?? Is porn for dirty old pervert's such as myself?? Well, I know this much. Most people come across porn and they see at least ten mins of it.  Some people see porn and they are turned off !!!!!!! Thay are so disgusted that they keep it in the drawer until nobody is around and play it over and over again.  So for all you porno enthusiast out there. WE MUST UNITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Peace, Love,  I love you like I love ceviche  Fish  >)))">

       What makes me.......... me?   What is the answer to that age old question? What makes Fish? Could I go out on a limb and give you a detailed description of what makes me??? NOPE. You have to figure that out on your own.  I am at work and I am fighting this damned nasal thing. I have chronic nasal problems and it kills me. Not the point.  Well, I was washig my teeth this morningand thinking what topic I am going to brush on in the blog today. Back in the day, I used to talk about sex, blowjobs, and how much I hate life. Now, I only talk about Poetry and how much I love life. I think I am offically gay. Hung out yesterday with my thug buddies. After the afternoon shift ( ends at 8pm) of selling drugs. I met up with them to have a quick bite to eat. I love them kats like nobody else. I felt seriously out of place.  I keep my conversation about me at a minumal ( is that spelled right ?). I don't want overkill them with all this talk about Poetry and what I have been doing, it would overshadow their days of " Bitches and gossip ".    The conversations mainly were routed to who fucked who, lack of money, things have changed. I was talking to a former " boss " of mines and his words were " how the fuck do you do it ?". I always attest my success and happiness to living as simple as possible. I have been trying my hardest to make these motherfuckers think that life is not that bad out of the hood. They have this incredible fear and confused notion that they belong and have to stay in the ghetto. I tell them to experience other lifestyles besides Hennesy and the occasional travel back and forth to Santo Domingo to get laid. They don't listen to me. They compare me to the radical revolutionary that tries to change what he grew up in.  I honestly don't want to change nobody, I just want them to know there is sooo much more then just " Watson AVE ". There is so much more then hanging out and getting fucked up. There is more then having the fattest car, nicest clothes, biggest chain, most money.  We hit a real sour note when we started talking about all the brothers that have died. I mentioned the poem that I wrote for one of our best friends. They wanted to read it and I read it for them. Sure enough, the last 3 sentences keep me choked up. I shed some tears. So out of the 6 people eating, 6 were wiping away tears. We all knew Freddy and looked up to him as our mentor and he was taken away from us. On this table, I could point out enough dirt to make sure we all do life in jail. Yet, we took a moment of silence, cried, then laughed.  I miss the fellas but in being with them, I realized that lifestyle was going to kill me and maybe do something worst. In our field, death is not the worst thing. So, my life turned for a postive note and I appreciate it. Life is good for me.   So, as I didn't do it last night......  " For my niggas, I put this cup up and toast to a long life. I will never judge you nor condemn you. I am a thug and I will always have your back. Even if it is just in thought, I love ya niggas "  Kinda fucked up in the head today.  Peace, Love  Fish  >)))">

       Acentos Perfection....... Just a teensy weensy bit too hot   Oh man, Acentos is shaping up to be one of the best venues that has been birthed in the South Bronx. The founders might have had their skills honed in midtown but they have reaped the benefits and brought it to Mott Haven. Acentos was a great mix once more as a steady crowd streamed into The Blue Ox Bar. Some regulars and new audience members took up every chair in the house. The open mic was a strong mix of wonderful Acentos vets with two new voices shining in the 3- 5 minute spotlight. Lila ( Curator and strong arm of Poetry Hill ) read on the mic. Others to take the plunge were Rich Villar, Nashid Chance, Mabel ( A.K.A Loca ), Acentos regular and seasoned spoken word veteran Holmes McHenry and our very own Superintendent on premises, Ultimate Boricua Henry Valentin. All the reads were strong and were much appreciated by the crowd and Acentos alike.  Our Feature for the evening was the epitome of a Bronx born poet. Steven " Bonafide " Rojas gave us a mental road trip through his growing up latino. His poem dedicated to his dad, his students, to his heritage and upbringing had the Blue Ox attentive and entranced. A great feature with a knack of story telling and kind barbs to his mother and sister that were indiscreetly seated in the audience gave for a great evening.  A new format experimented for the first time at Acentos was a Question and answer session curated by Oscar. The questions asked ranged from an ardent reading of poetry to furthering your knowledge of the craft.  A personal insight to the accomplishments and  life of Bonafide gave everyone in Blue Ox bar an extreme sense of family and commonality.  Our mission statement was brought to life!!!!!!!  All together, great night, great feature. June 24th, 2003. Join us for the next Acentos spotlight shining of " Toro ". A new Jersey based poet that gave us a taste on  the Acentos Open mic and we had to ask him to come give us more.  Take care  Fish

       Awesome feature and destruction on the head to head   So, if your little feet ddin't take you to Bar 13 yesterday, you missed out on one of the best Monday's in a long time. I will tell you about the feature first:  Yesterday, Cheryl Boyce Taylor was our feature at Bar 13. This lady has no words to describe her. She has been there 85% of the time when we needed encouraging words about our poetry. She is a friend, teacher, Mother, poet, Writer, and posseses a heart that will make platinum blush. Her words are deep and powerful but paintbrushed with a soft outside to enter our minds gently. She has a talent and honed skill that undoubtedly makes her special. She was nervous with no need to be as to everyone was focused on her and every word she had to say. I had to sacrifice about ten minutes of her feature to make sure that we could convey our appreciation of her in the form of a dozen roses and one sunflower. The roses that were blooming were significant of what LouderARTS is. The sunflower reperesented what cheryl is to us. I know it was kinds sappy but I am man enough to say that she is special and has touched many people. I am not only happy that I know her, I am honored to have her as a friend.  The open mic was once again an array of interest. We had our LouderEDGE format and several poets were up there putting it all out. I had to give my opinion ( it is only that ) to Amanda ( I am not even going to spell her last name because it would be a total travesty if I fucked it up ). She had a great poem about to lesbians in NYC and many images of what they had to go through. The payoff at the ending was very sweet. She brought it home very nicely and there wasn't much critique I could have given her.I just suggested giving the Piece more personality. Maybe adding two names to the two people. Yet, after hearing the piece, it would take away from the payoff. I had to also critique Youlanda on her piece. Once again, her piece was too short and her metaphor left me hanging.  She needs to explore deeper into her writing and pull out much more vivid images to make her poem pay off.  Off the tope of my head, Rich ( In which is getting a good spot in my heart), Chance ( Hardest working man in Poetry ), that is all I remember??? Damn, I need to start smoking weed to remember shit.  After our open mic, wow, our head to head slam bout between Tai Freedom Ford -vs- Celena Glenn.   5 rounds of Poetry between two serious heavyweights. My loyalties are with Bar 13 but damn, Celena is off the hook. Yet, rooting for Tai I went.  First round was the coke classic round in which they said there classic poem Second round was the Goddess of My desire round in which a poem by their favorite poet was read Third round was If Bob Marley was a lesbian round in which I have no fucking clue what is was suppose to be Fourth round was the Improv round in which words from the audience were used in an improve poem Fifth round was the anything goes round in which anything goes. Let me go over the highlights that makes it interesting.  Tai killed it in the first round with her coke classic Poem. IF I was worth something, I would know the name of that poem. So, as of now, I am a piece of shit.  Now, Celena took Homeland ( credit Marty ) and she spun that sucker into her own rendition. It was funnet but that poem needs energy and bringing to a low overtone might have killed her. Then again, I don't know shit.  IF the Bob Marley was a lesbian round lost me as soon as they mentioned it, so, no need to write about that.  Let me run straight into the anything goes round.  Tai went up there and kept it to Poetry in didn't make it into a debacle. Now, her is where I will insert my opinion  ( insert Fish Opinion here )  Celena went up there with a whole bunch of people ( Shawn Randall,  plus 3 ). This is where I thought that the poetry lost it's edge. Celena got some serious freestyling skills. I heard her and I was looped. Then, her Partner Shawn throws up the mic and spits some lyrics and it just couldn't compare. I have always defended that dude when it came down to his poetry freestyling, now, after hearing him on par with Celena, I don't know.He decided to  throw a barb at the 13 crew about nationals. Unfortunately, we have much more to worry about then some inconsequential jolts of nonsense. I am a believer in karma and even addressing it is much more then a waste of my time. Barbs and disses don't count. Let's talk after nationals.  So, behold this news.......

       HOLA!!!!!!!!!   So, I was about three seconds to getting a heart attack last night. I have gotten so used to my phone never ringing that when it does ring ( after 1 am ) it almost fucking killed me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am watching TV and watching some house show doing a thing on electricity, I was all into it, then the phone rings and I jumped like a piece of hot coal was shoved in my ass.  How are the masses today??? I hope that everyone had a great weekend. Mines was good. Yesterday out of all days, I wanted to come downtown and do some work ( poetry ) in my job. I have this book for the fellas. It is a book specifically penned for prisoners that want to write. So, I am making about  30 copies and handing it out to them. I would have did it yesterday but, 2.5 million Puerto Ricans converged on 5th avenue to celebratetheir heritage, culture, traditions. I used to go to these parades religiously but after being corraled like cattle by the NYPD, I chose to stop going. Plus, My days of going and looking at all these women half naked just doesn't do it for me. I used to go with the intention of getting as many numbers as possible. THen, that went out the window. Then, we used to go to have a good time but we always wound up fighting. So, no more parades for e until I hit the ripe old age of 40. After that, I will go early with a chair, my bottle of pepsi, and my PLAIN FLAG with no silkscreened bullshit, and I will will enjoy the festivities.   So, I will say this ........ Hasta Pasta.....  Peace, Love  Que Se Joda!!!!!!!!!!  Fish  >)))">

       She sings    She was 21 with fair olive tone skin Her eyes were wide and her hair flaccid peppered with miss clairol highlights She was of Puerto Rican Descent to a mother that worked in a factory, a father that was a security guard and a bagel maker She was the first to finish high school and seem destined to become great. She sings of success  She attends community college and scrapes by with minumal financial aid Her friends talk of parties, young men, and the far too often cheap sexual tryst that made                                                     most young women sluts. Her mind wanders and her work in school shows it with the far more common ì cî and ìdî and a gpa that barely broke 2. Her best friend would convince her to attend a neighborhood party She sings of something new  Deadlines for papers come and it doesnít matter,  she is no where to be found.  Her attendance poor and her attention span worse Academic probation, warnings, and finally she was convinced to leave school She sings rebellion  She parties and swallows demons, becoming free of life, she sings the liquor She smokes her songs of rebellion. She drinks her melodies of utopia She sings her pain of becoming the victim of three ways, lurid pictures, and the occasional STD. Time stops when she rest her head on her pillow while nursing her bruises, split lips, and loosened teeth She sings her sadness  Blinding chants building on her songs, she loses herself. She loses her songs of success. Her songs of darkness and dismay more apparent in her teetering between failure and her yearning song of redemption.  She sings and cries,  she sings her anger at herself  She sings failure She sings her addiction She sings her late night tricks  Strumming her keys of desperation, she reconciles her stringent song She finds her rhythm in righteousness A lullaby of praise She sings a long road to travel back   If you got this far, you will now know that the previous poem is what I call a super first draft. I will make some edits and remind myself of my Five edit and revise rule.  Leave some feedback in the guestbook. I should read this one in about 5 weeks.  LOL  Peace

       My motherfuckin niggas   What's up people's. I hope that you are all doing well.  I am back at the blogger thing and I have seen tis thing grow into something integral amongst my peers, friends, confidants, and even lovers. I have opened my doors of emotions and have received e-mails that have rejuvenated me. They have taken my life apart and put it back together better then it was before. Is it right that 85% of the times that I write on here that i have to open up??? If it proves that people that care will write me and open up themselves and in turn we help each other, so be it.  I, myself am surrounded by great people that I am starting to love very dearly. The taking time out to write me a letter about the organization of Oscar's Birthday shindig and the love they felt. The Thank you's about the Rikers Showcase. This makes the world turn for me. Thank you guys  Ok, yesterday was Rikers and the showcase that I organized for the fellas ( inmates ). Ginna, Lynne, Oscar, Edward, Bonafide, Helen, and myself headed to the Isalnd with poems in tow to read. Ray was there but do to my momentary lapse of stooooopidity, I left Ray mond behind. I truly have to make it up to him. This mainly because he didn't seem quite upset and didn't blow a fuse when I spoke to him. I will make it up with a dinner or something. Roger was supposed to be there also but the trini was sleeping. I will let him slide becuase when a brother hussles as hard as he does, I can't blame the cat for getting a couple of z's.  We made our way onto he Island with minamal hassle and the fellas were all there ready , willing, and attentive.  Anyway, we got to the class and starting the read was one of the fellas with a poem about NY. It was good to hear them read.  Lynne started her read and she did great as always, Ginna seemed rather tired and she gave it her all. Oscar went up introduced then to Oscar the Poet. Helen read a poem that touched the fellas in more ways then one. The emotion that she gave off made the guys aware of the power of the word. Ed Garcia went up and introduced the fellas to some poetry that had seckles of Humor. Bonafide killed it as he best knows how.  I dropped most of the poets after we got off the island and made my way to my house. It is 4:30 and I haven't touched my bed. I wrote the whole night. I wrote my own perosnal mission statement and I am happy as fuck with how my life is going. The showcase had me thinking of so much more of what we can do as an organization to the less fortunate. Acentos brings poetry to the Bronx. Louder brings new emerging voices. What are we going to do personally? This Freshstart Program is loving Louder and we are cemeting a solid relationship. This will do nothing but give us more resources in spreading poetry and writing. In my search in becoming a better writer, I also want to engage the far less talented and make them realize that a Pen and Paper can change a life. I have always said that Poetry has changed my life. I am realizing something very slowly. Poetry is a small part of something much bigger that I am becoming a part of. Writing!!!!!!!!!!  Writing is giving me breathe. Writing is pumping the blood through my veins. Writing is the foundation of everything I am standing for.  One day, I am going to write everything that I know. From day one until the day I die, I am going to write everything. Let's see what happens then.  Today was the second open house at the Bronx Academy of Letters ( High School for Creative Writing ). I made my presence known and had a good candid conversation with the Principal, Joan Sullivan. I blatantly told her, to just let me know where she would want the LouderARTS project to fit in Her curriculum. She was very adament that she definitely wanted to work with us. So with that said, I think our finger is embedded ( Like those reporters in Iraq ) quite well. Understandby so, I can't teach for the Board of ed because of my record. I shed enough tears because of that. My mistake in 1998 is costing my progress in 2003. I still won't let that stop me.  I have some teaching things that are coming up and I am totally excited. I might actually have something going on in the Bedford Hill Correctional Facility ( jail for women ) to teach some poetry and writing.  I took Marty's workshop today and I was very happy with the outcome. I learned some things and that is always good. We did a great exercise about what we want, can have, can't have.  I noticed that I am not too much into the material things. I just need the good ol happiness, love, and cherishment.    Thanks to all the guys that have gone to rikers and showed the fellas love. I appreciate so much the time you took out. I know it is hard. THANK YOU a million times over.  Let me run. I need some sleep  Good Night  :)  Oh.... I have to shout out my new Cuban connection. I didn't write you back because I rather write quality and something worthy of a read. I appreciate the e-mail. You are a good dude, with a heart to match. I am glad you have made your way to our little world. Have fun in the work shop.  Fish  >)))">

       the matters of loss and pain   Good morning, I took a day off from the job today. I needed to stay away from the nonsense in my job. It is not that bad but this has been a hard week and just trekking into Manhattan was hard. Next week Monday will be a new day and I am just going to do my thing. I got my hours worth of sleep and I feel ok today. Of course life could be better.  Here are some thoughts for the masses.............  Have you ever felt that you knew for a fact that you were in love ? You had that one person i your life that you knew was the perfect person for you and for some insane reason, your heart was broken.  Does your heart heel?? Do you live life as a lesson learned ?  I have no freakin clue as to what life has in store for me and that sometimes brings me to this serious depressing mode!!! I wish I could just wake up and say,  " I know what I am going to do " and keep walking in that direction. This is the negative side of letting things fall in your lap and not going after something.  I get scared pretty easy when it comes down to my emotions and sometimes I wonder why the heart is so fragile. I know it is like stained glass when it comes down to family, relationships, and tight freinds. Other then that, I am a fuckin rock to society. I remember when I was younger, nothing phased me. I didn't have a care in the world. No worries about work. No financial worries. No relationship to nurture. Nothing. Then life hit. Oh shit. Life hit with a ton of bricks. Fell in love, bitch broke my heart. rebounded with the next chic and thought I was in love. Moved out with her and spent about 10 g's on my first apartment and she tried to take everything. Moved out to my own apartment and in NYC, alone and paying bills if hard as fuck!!!! Been through some shit ( ie. Locked up, doing constant dirt to get out of financial dire straits, hated everything, lost friends, ). This has made me a skeptic. This has made me me into a wall that will take years to crack.  It is hard for me just to be me.   I am a good dude. I am loyal to my friends. I am good to my family. I am loving.  Still, It is all just me  Ok. I am going to Rikers today with a showcase of awesome poets to put a show on for the students. Today trekking to rikers will be...........  Oscar Bermeo Fish Raymond Daniel Medina Lynne Procope Roger Bonair Agard GinnaKarla Nicolas Steven Bonafide Rojas Helen Yum Edward Garcia  This are the highest caliber of Poets in maybe all of NYC.  They will read for the students and I hope  will get at least one student to write after his release. This program has meant the world to me because I feel like I am giving back. So much to do but such little time to do it in with this guys.  Well, I be off.  Peace   urlLink LouderARTS Project

       when plans come together, life is grand   2 am and I have no intentions on sleeping. This is was happens when you feel good and you are afraid of going to sleep. Yea, I haven't been sleeping that much because of this one recurring dream that is really fuckin with me. Not the point......  Just got back from Oscar's Birthday shindig in Brooklyn. Talk about a nice turn out. I wish I had all them bastards at every Acentos. I would be one happy camper. I walked in with Oscar at 8:35pm and 90% of the people that I hae invited were there. Oscar wasn't really that suprised cause he knew that we were headed to the Ceviche spot. I still don't think that he knew the scope of the people that were going to be there. Shit, I even invited Taylor Mali and he showed with Dawn Saylor. That is fucking cool.  So....... Guy, Salome, with two kids in tow........ Eric Cheryl Boyce taylor ( Thank you for more then just showing up ) Youlanda Jayme Lynne Roger Marty Elana Edward Jeannie Ginna Mara Bonafide Seve or Steve or whatever name I could call him Maria Rich Villar Jay Keith Miguel Mary My Motherfuckin nigga E dawG!!! Helen Yum Raymond Diane   I am not much of a public speaker but I made my small speech for Oscar.  Ray read a small poem dedicated to Oscar and it was nice. Ginna tapped into her comedic well and read something cute for Oscar. We wished him a happy Birthday and everything went really nice. We took out this cake that Maria ( The chef ) baked and it was hands down incredible. She wrote a couple of poems on top of the cake with a fountain pen and an inkwell. The cake was perfect for a poet.  Most of us to almost all of us had the Shrimp ceviche and we all joked and laughed.  I hope that the OMX was happy and he deserves this. Even though we all have our differences and issues, we all tend to love one another unconditonally. A couple of people didn't show up and I don't really mind. To think of the positive, we just had a good time.  I just wish that someone was there to enjoy the food.   :(  Time to run..........  I have a new piece that was born today and I have to work at it.  Peace

       Moving again   Sometimes I wonder when I am going to have an office that I would stay for the rest of my days here. Once again, I am moving. I was actually liking it up here. No one would bother me and I spend most of my days out of sight. The more moves and changes I go through in this job, the more I resent every bit of this place. Don't get me wrong, I love this job. Yet, these motherfuckers change shit cuase there is nothing to do and they want to make it seem as if there IS something to do.   I am back at my job today and Not many people knew, I was home yesterday. I would blame it on the French food I had the night before but I doubt it. I am going to chalk it up to stress and more stress.  Why am I stressed??? Well, it is officially over between my significant other and I.  This is the funny part. We got along great, we helped each other, she supported me and I the same for her. The sex was great. Nothing was done to warrant a break up such as she played me or I played her.  No third party affiliations caused the end. What caused the end?? I would say something life altering. I would say something so mind blowing that I couldn't be with her. I know that a mix of things is in my head and I could put my finger on some of them............ Fear emotional instability This ardent yearning for a solitary existence ( I wanted to be alone ) Seeing someone falling in love with you when you know you can't give that back  The only things I could say over and over again is that I am sorry and I feel so much pain. You know when you let something go, you think it is for the better. I hope that in doing that, it is for the better of everything i our lives. Funny thing, I couldn't even bring myself to grips to say " It's over ". I feel that it will never be over. I feel that we will always be a part of each other. As lovers, friends, confidants, we have made that integral connection that comes under stringent emotional bonding.   She is probably going to read this and maybe cry. She will probably get to writing a letter and zip it over in an e-mail. I just know that sooner or later, everything will be ok. Right now, shit is just fucked up.  I am going out with napoleon tonight  ( Non-poetry ). After that, home to sleep and NOT write.   Ok.  I debuted a new piece yesterday that most likely I will read at Bar 13 Monday. I haven't read there for a very long time. I blame Guy, he kept me off the Mic. It is all his fault. It is easy to blame him now. He left the collective so it is easy to blame the nigga that left. These are the things I am blaming Guy on:  There is Peace is the middle east coming ......... Blame Guy Hot 97 summer jam was a sucess....... Blame Guy I got sick and stood home moping....Blame Guy Hilary wrote a book about her husband's betrayal......Blame Guy Racheal and Joey are getting kinky on Friends...... Blame Guy Guy is reading this blogger cause he has nothing to do at work......... Blame Guy  Ok, enough pandering to you blogger readers.   I am doing well and I have several things going on in the next few days.  I will get back to my thing and I catch up with ya.  Peace, Love,

       Home on the range   My peasants!!! I hope when you focus those liquid filled circular objects in your face to my blooger, you are in the very best of health. So, I am going on two days without sleep. Time is at a stand still and with this, pain seems constant.   Last night was a cool night, we hooked up to go see ' Democrazzy". It was a collaborative play between poets, musicians, dancers, singers. Roger and Lynne were a part of it and it blew my mind. This was the first time that I have ever seen anything like this and seeing two of my peers in that setting. It was an experience and I am glad I went.  Short Blog today. Too much on my mind.

       Someone actually threatened to knock my teeth out   Yes, you have read that right, someone actually told me, fish, that they will knock my teeth out. Yesterday was my day to change the batteries in the panic doors on all fire exits in my company. This is a responsibility of the....." Fire Safety Director ". I actually don't think that these people know that if a fire breaks out, I would call them from the safety and confines of the street. LOL. Anyway, I was changing these batteries and I saw this lady several floors down catching some puffs from a cancer stick. So, I jokingly told her that smoking in the building was not allowed. Her opening the emergency exit door would compromise the safety of my employees. She proceeded to ask me who I was and why I was in her business. She then told me to shut the fuck up before she comes up and knocks my teeth out. Funny is when I yelled down and told her what floor I was on and to come and do me the favor of giving me free dentistry. I was already slightly pissed and just chalked it up to a stupid bitch that I wouldn't see ever again. About three seconds later, this trashy bitch walk onto my floor and say who the hell are you!!??  I was like, oh, you promised to knock my teeth out, do me the favor!! Got up from my knees and walked out of the darkness and she for some reason got really quiet. She got her bearings back and tried to intimidate me by saying, I am getting fired for talking to her is this grievous manner. This bitch is nobody in this building and she thinks she is getting me fired. I have been here 14 going on 15 years. I hob knob with the creme de la creme of this building and this trashy cancer filled heathen thinks she could threaten me. I followed he to the elevator and sure enough, he boss is Susan Cuccinello that I have know for a full 15 years in this building. When her boss came out and hugged me, I said " We have to talk about one of you extremely rude, arrogant, and unprofessional employees. I could have ripped that bitch a new asshole. I chose not too. I just told Susan that the lady had a slight attitude and needed it to be checked. Sure enough, I left her office and walked passed the lady and I stopped at her desk and leaned over, " Enjoy unemployment ". She was not happy. I don't want anyone to lose their job, times is tough right now.I could have been on mean motherfucker, yet, I was nice. So, I have done two good deeds in the span of 1 week.   Today is OMX birthday. Email that little nigga and tell him Happy Birthday!! CAll his ass, Shout his old ass out....!!!!!!!!!!!  Peace  Regardless of what you read here. It is a very hard day for me. I am ok thought. I am good at hiding things out and I don't want that one person that means alot to me thinking that my life is going on as if nothing has changed.  Life is hard sometimes.

       THis is what it is all about!!!!!!!!!!   **********  This is the e-mail that I received from a fellow artist. I have asked her permission to share this e-mail and she agreed. Understand that things like this is what makes life very nice. Hey Fish, Whats Up?    So today, I have been surfing through poet's journals, (as I just started putting together my own on my site), and I came across yours and your latest entry. I felt really passionate about it, so I wanted to send you a note. I really loved the way you expressed yourself and I hope you don't mind me sharing some of my thoughts on the subject with you.   I have spent a lot of time this past month or two thinking about the concept of  peer criticism in the poetry "scene", and how to deal with it. I am from the camp as you mentioned that we all have the right to critique anything, but also believe how we deal with our critiques is also very important. I would much rather someone come to my face, and give me constructive criticism, then trash me behind my back. But this rarely happens. Criticism is difficult. For everyone, but I think some people hide it better than others. I am the first to  admit that I'm real sensitive about my work, and any criticism I have had has been a difficult pill to swallow, but I am working on getting better at receiving it, and it has made me a stronger person. I have had to accept not everyone has to like my work, or relate to it. BUT rarely has the criticism sent my way, been presented in an honest constructive artist to artist communication, and I feel that is unfortunate. That is not to say I would agree with everything someone says, because as artists  I believe we have the right  to filter the criticism we get, because it is not always free of bias. Sometimes if  people come into a situation wanting to not like someone, it is so  very easy to find lots of faults in them and  to pick them to shreds. but again I  would rather someone be upfront with me, or as you mentioned just keep the thoughts to themselves. In my book, Thats ok as well. We don't all have to be vocal critics.  BUT, I also take responsibility for occasionally  falling into this kind of behavior, and loved your "open call" statement. Falling into the bandwagon and putting peoples work down in a non-constructive way, can be a very contagious attitude. I am really, really  trying to stay away from this kind of behavior and  your statement " we are better than nobody as people" really struck home. On that note, I also add that I think sometimes people will not like the Person because of their poetry and though as poets we speak from our personal  thoughts and ideas, someone can be not a great poet but a great person.   I had a recent situation where I sat down to  read some poetry of a poet that I know does not care much for my work. The instinctive attitude I felt myself having while reading it was that I was trying to find something I didn't like about it because on a  real basic human level  I was hurt that this person didn't like me, or my work!  But what happened was I LOVED ALL HIS POETRY. Really loved it,  and respected it so much, and then I  felt more sad, because I thought, wow, this person maybe could have been a great person to talk to about my work with, but instead it never played itself out like that.  In any case I also think the concept of SLAM probably contributes to some of this, because well competition can bring out so many things in people. I for one, am kinda happy my slam year has come to a close. I feel like its really time to get back to the lab to write, and slam demands a certain attitude that I'm just kinda exhausted with right now. I had to laugh about your section about people with their "slam strategy science" . I also have heard EVERY strategy under the sun, and, you are right that it is so unpredictable!  I've done the same everything on different nights and had totally different results. I actually I think it is THAT stuff that  that I'm exhausted with more than the performing of the pieces in a slam. I'm soooooooo not a strategy girl. LOL!  It gets me all frenzied and twisted in my head. I just wanna get up on the stage and do my thing, but it always seems more complicated, and i beat myself up about it after.  Anyway, I feel kinda crazy sharing all this with you, cause, well I know we've never really spoken much, and  of course there is a part of me that must accept, you might not like me or my poetry, and after all this  (LOL) that might put you in a position to have to be real honest with me or not answer me at all!  but seriously whatever you think of me or my work, it's cool, cause well, like I said this is just  part of my journey to accept everything for what it is, and I'm really happy to have stumbled upon your thoughts today. It definitely had an impact on me.  From one artist to another, I really respect what you had to say, and how you said it.   Peace-   ******** This is something that makes me smile.   Peace......... Fish

       BBQ and overkill   oH MAN, I just got to the household and I wanted to write this incredible email on the great time that I had today at my boys BBQ. Then, I opened this e-mail that had to be the best e-mail from any poet that I have ever gotten. I got the e-mail in response to my last blog entry and it threw me for a loop. I will see if with the permission of said sender, I could share it. Until then, hear about my day.  So, I headed to Mike's house for his Birthday celebration today in Ossinning, NY. I need to tell you first thing about what was placed in my stomach.  shishkabobs............ 5 ribs..........................4 burgers.....................2 cookies ( homemade)....at least ten. chocolate mint girl scout cookies salad 1 plate of rice 10 homade girl scout cookies 7 bootleg cola sodas salad coffee  I would write about the batroom experience but more people then I realized read this blog. UHhhhhhhhhhhhh........ Fuck that. I Blew that bathroom to pieces. :)  I had a great time at Mike's house and I would not mind going up there again. It is a great place to get away and the neighborhood is quite. He got the BBQ and I think I am taking my Hammock up there.   Alot of people were there and it was very nice and they treated us well. I was happy. Food was being thrown at the token fat Puerto Rican guy. I had no qualms eating it. Tom was his usual self and I forgot how beash he is with some of his comments, still, Tom is tom and I pretty much accepted it.  Ok, I would write in more detail but I have the previous e-mail I forementioned to reply too.  Take care  Peace Love  Watch Spice Clips on the hot network, it is off the hook

       Profound conversations and the Nuyo    I finally got my time to write the masses. I have soooo much to write but I will keep it to what I feel is most important. I won't divulge what I feel should be kept business oriented between the people that run the business. Ok.......  Friday was the last Nuyo Run off Slam. The participants were Rob Neil ( In which I was rooting for ), Hostage, Anacaona, Mister E, Vanessa ( the Hebrew Mamita ) Hiderig. If I killed the spelling on any of those names, don't be offended. The slam was prety strong and I have seen all the poets do their work before. I knew that if hostage killed them early he would take the slam, sure enough, I was right. He took the crowd to what " ignorant masses" want to hear. He dropped this poem in which some people thought was not a good poem. Yet, he got a perfect 30.   Some of the poets dropped some really good pieces but they didn't bare so well. This is the part where I say that slams are unpredictable. I have heard different takes on the slam scene from many different poets. Not one has convinced me of " their " science " to winning a slam. I have heard people talk strategy and they didn't win. I have heard people just go with the flow and drop a 9 minute poem and get a 30.  Slams are just like football, baseball, and everything else competitive. You never can really know for sure how to win it. There is strategy but which one to use??? So, I am glad that I haven't been all about slams when it comes down to this scene. I have only slammed  4 times. 2 times at Bar 13. 1 time at Bucknell University. 1 time at BCC. I were in them and I wasn't ready and I did very well considering. I am getting ready now to just do my thing. In the BCC slam, out of 35 poets, I made the top 5. I stepped down because I wasn't happy with the judging system and I found it very unfair. So I decided to leave. It was a $500 dollar top prize, $300 dollar second  spot, $250 dollar third spot. Money doesn't make a poet, winning doesn't make a poet. A writer that dedicates his time to create awesome work that will touch the majority of society is what makes a good writer. This brings me to another point. As of this moment, I am in no way nor how interested in submitting any of my work for publishing, grants, lit mags, newspapers, contests, or anythng for that matter. I don't feel comfortable with people reading my work as of yet. The reason why it took me soo long to share my words was because that is all I had, now, I share them on the mic and on paper with a very selective few. In time, my work will beg " me " to be published, until then, I am in a very safe place with my writing and it will stay there until otherwise.  Well, as a poet that is better then the average writer( first timer I guess ). I have cuaght myself on occasion saying things about other poets that is not constructive, productive, nor optimistic. I tend not to like it when other poets convey their opinion as if it was law and the poem they just heard was not " up to par " with the expantancy of the better poet. It is something that I have heard, seen, and even taking part in. I am part of a certain society that has the ardent responsiblity of bringing and giving new voices an opportunity to better themselves and finding themselves as writers. Why should I shoot anybody down if their poem sucked?? So, in order to change anybody else, I wil have to change my self in order to bring change. Up next is an open call..........  " If I am with you, and I hear an open mic'er/ poet recite a very bad piece, call me out if I make a remark that puts down that poet. Also, I ask anyone that is with me, I no longer would like to hear condescending remarks about a poet that is not that good. Instead of shouting them out, think of how to make them better. Of course, there are poets that are not that good and we don't like them as a person, well, no comments will be my norm "  We are better then nobody as people. Some people don't like others for a variety of reasons. What brings me to this is the hypocrisy that i have personally seen amongst some of my piers. I do not understand how people can talk about them and then smile when they are in the same room. I for one do not like you, I will not associate myself with you. Hypocrites are the worst forms of life in this world. Hypocrites are snitches and rats in my neighborhood and they tend to get shot, killed and smacked.  I tend to shy away from people like that.  Society is not a perfect science . Friendships, relationships, work, and everything else involved socially will have good parts and it's bad parts. We have the right to critique anything, but we also have the right to defend anything we feel is worth defending. Things will be simply put, not everything will make everyone happy. Things will always leaning towards a direction that will make one person unhappy. On the parallel, it is leaning in the same direction that is making another extremely happy.  I am a writer and I will ever be anything else but a writer. Under the umbrella of writer comes a great person, funny, sexually frustrated.  Take care,  Peace, Love,

       Culture and bandit    That is the dynamic duo of Rich and Fish. Before you ask, I am the bandit. If you are asking where that came from, it came from seeing Vanessa Hiderig one woman show called " Culture Bandit ". Oh wow, this was a treat and great opportunity.   The invitation was given and I accepted. It was also free!!!!! Zippo fee!!!! Nada en dinero!!!!! As a poet, I am Mr Broke.   I got there a little bit late but I only missed the first five minutes of the show.  Well, Ms Vanessa hidery has shown me something today that I can't really deny. She showed a very personal side in her show that finished a puzzle for me to fully understand her. She literally grabbed me by the hand and took me from 1984 through her current life. She delved into Hip hop, R&B, neighborhood friends, and many instances of the great borough of the Boogie getting mentioned. Her personal battle of being jewish in her upbringing, in a barrio peppered with almost everything besides jewish brethren,  has really made her solid. Her references to her friends and nuances that she has gone through,  were  nostalgic and heart tugging. She had so much in her show that I could relate to,  it made it perfect for my enjoyment. When she started doing the " wop ", I thought I was going to die. When she started busting out all the " Hip hop house " dances, she took me back to " 1018 " when all the thugs played the walls and looked  " hard ".  The best enjoyable moment for me...... ( forgive me V ) but when she said her ass wasn't fat, it was healthy. Damn girl, You need to STOP THAT!!!!!!!!!!  The show was awesome and I would recommend for anyone to go see it at the first opportunity. I didn't take detailed notes but I left there very happy with what I saw.    After the show, we schmoozed with Ricky Cabico and some people from Def Jam.  Who knows what connects were made.   Ok  Let me bounce  peace

       I have been inspired.......    I tend to just enter one long blog entry per day and today I know many people were wondering what happened. I wasn't going to write anything but I just got some great material. I was reading Guy's Blog today ( excellent entry by the way ) and I got this slight itch on my foot. So, my legs are crossed and I take off my sneaker. I proceed to scratch and this god aweful retched odor filled my nasal cavities. I am thinking, ok, what was that ??? Then, after my brain use some of the very few intelligient braincells that it has left, I am shocked that my feet smell like old ass!!!!! I usually wear boots and my feet never smell. I have been wearing these sneakers and I can't tell you the smell that is coming from my feet. Funny thing is, I took off my sneakers and put it to my nose and took a whiff. I thought I was going to die!!!!!!!!! Why do my feet smell like geriatric bowel movements???  Why does the inside of my sneaker resemble a morgue with no freon in the air conditioning????  Yo, seriously, I am not joking, my feet smell like ass!!! Oh God, I need to get my boots!!!!!!!  ( holding nose, typing with one hand )  take care while I die from this stench!!!!!  Help  Fish

       YOu gotta love the older Mrs Fish    My moms is off the hook. I come home in the worst fuckin mood in such a long time and there stands my mom with a Modells bag. 6 brand new t-shirts to take to Nats with me. My mother doesn't care that I am busting my ass writing poetry, but she does care that I look decent on stage.  YOu have to love the Maternal parental unit.  Well, on that note, I am feeing better and change will come. I just have to think long and hard about what I have to do and put the changes into effect. I am not 17 anymore, I have no patience.

       My mornings suck.......   I wonder why in the hell do things happen to me. I wake up and I get out of bed and I am  careful because I am convinced that a " Final Destination " type of entity is yearning to just destroy my day.   I pick up the tube of toothpaste this morning and I squeeze some onto the tootbrush and the last little bristle ( is that even a word ) flicks some tootpaste into my eye. OH MAN!!!!!  Now I know what I need to torture Lenny into giving me some, I just have to tie her up and put toothpaste into her eye.  The burning sensation will have even the toughest of the tough screaming like a baby.  So, yesterday was a good day. I got a letter from the Osborne association thanking the LouderARTS project for all the hard work that Oscar and I did for the FreshStart Program. Most likely, I will attach it at the bottom of this page. Feels good to have someone be thankful for the hardwork that you do. Makes life feel really good.  Nationals is getting really close and I am getting antsy. It is going to be a ball out there. We are going to have fun and get the whole experience and soak it like a sponge.  Today I am going to sneak out of here and go to an interview for " Mind Builders ". It is an organization for youth to research culture and folk lore. My name came up and I was contacted for a showcase on August 16. It should be fun with all the little kids interviewing me and asking me questions. So, 12:30pm and I will formally play bellvue at my job and ask to leave. LOL. Gotta love the job.  Let me run  Peace, Love  Take care  Chuletas con papas  Fish  ***************Following is a letter from Osborne***************  Dear LouderARTS project,  Words cannot begin to express the tremendous impact that the wonderful poets of the Louder Arts Project have had on the Fresh Start program and its participants. Our students have embraced writing and the creative process not only as a form of self-_expression but also as an alternative to self-defeating behaviors. Their enlightenment as a result of Sam and Oscarís workshops has brought great excitement and wonderful new options into their lives.  The students were able to let their guards down and allowed themselves to be vulnerable and even a bit sensitive. Many of our students discovered areas of themselves that they never knew existed and thought in ways that they never knew were possible. Sam and Oscar truly blessed our students with a gift that can never be taken away from them for as long as they live. As the saying goes, " if you give a hungry man a fish, he eats for one day but if you teach him to fish, he eats for a lifetime ".  The students of the Fresh Start Program were given jewels that far outweigh any form of materialism. On behalf of the Osborne Association and the Fresh Start Program, we thank the Louder Arts Project for Sam and Oscar and hope to continue this relationships in the future.  Sincerely,  Marianna Shturman  Program Director  ************************  Life is Good *******************************

       Tuesday's are worthless days........  ........ except when we are hosting Acentos.  What a great day yesterday. a Little bit louder was hands down raw dawg yesterday. I am not good with headcounts but I have to say we had to have had at least 200 people there last night. Standing room only and the day was hot. Last night was the third leg of the NYC regionals involving the three venues in NYC. Nuyo took it last night and they formally swept. Gotta give them credit for moving the crowd to give them " niggers " good scores.   We headed to this little spot to munch out and I have to start a rumor. I think no one like the Acentos Crew. We are alone at acentos, we are alone at the restaurant. I think these people are actually not liking us. Well FUCK EVERYBODY!!!! We are just waiting to get banned from Bar 13.  I am just joking, don't get the panties bunched up.  The night was good and we had a great time with the open mic and the slam.  Short Blog..... I have alot to do today  Peace, Love,  Fish  p.s Last night my lenny refused to give me some, please e-mail her and give her the guilt trip.  LOL

       one century is toooo long   So, Bob hope has died less then two months after turning 100. Damn, I do not want to reach the age of 100.  Let me get to about 80 with some pseudo health issues and I would welcome the grim reaper with open arms. Especially if the grim reaper is naked under that black garb they wear.  Let the grim reaper look hot after a seafood meal and I would bend the reaper over and initiate my whole hearty loving that only Fish knows how to give. So, Mr Hope, Thank you for all the memories and I hope that you will have a great time in comedy heaven with , Frank Sinatra, Sammy DAvis Jr, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, John Wayne, Abbott and Costello, Every one of the stooges, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnez and everyone else.   So, should I be upset today from some nonsense that happened yesterday???? I was livid yesterday!!!!!!!! I was invited to go to a BBQ in Pa and I was incredibly happy to go. I wake up and get dressed. I grab this cooler that I got from my job ( I 'll explain later ) and I am walking to my car. I grab my cell phone to call my homegirl. The number was not there. I was fuckin pissed. I couldn't remember the number for the life of me. Seems that someone must have deleted the number the day before either by istake or on purpose. Regardless, I will never let anyone even touch my fuckin phone. Now, I had to deal with someone wondering why I haven't called to say wither I am not going or whatever the case might be. The excuse of " Someone deleted your number " is as cheesy as it can get.  I had to wait for them to call me ( then probably beef and shit ) and then figiure out what I to do. I got the phone call and after festering for about 4 hours from the initial on-set of bullshit, I headed out to Pa ( poconos ) to be exact.    Got out there and it was kinda cool, regardless of the ribbing that I got for getting there mad late. I still made the best of it and tried to have a good time. Coming home wasn't that bad since traffic was light and it pretty much went straight through.   Interesting was going over there seeing a really bad accident. I read in the paper this morning that a rotten and dead tree limb fell on a car. It killed the driver and broke another girls neck. Gotta be careful these days. Coming back home was crazy because too many people were in afucking rush and they were driving like animals.  Anyway, I had an ok time but I can't really get it out of my mind about that phone issue. I don't like when things like that happen.  Anyway, I am here at the job and I will bid ya ado.  Take care  Fish

       Seafood and Penne Vodka with ChickeN!!!!!!!!!!!   Oh man, you all know that I can not deny good food. Party, BBQ, Dinner, Sandwich, even a trip to White Castle will make a brotha chops quiver. I know when I was young, I wasn't a fan of seafood. Through the years the age grew with the experimenting of different foods. My first love is steak and seafood runs about a quarter length right behind it.  The best seafood is a broiled lobster tail, you can't go wrong with that. Wait, add a steak to the side of that lobster tail and you are heaven bound. Funny thing about seafood is that mythologically, it is an aphrodisiac ( don't even ask me if I even tried to spell that word right ). Seafood ( especially oysters ) will have your hormones all out of wack. You could have been just chillin with no hint of sexual frusttrations at all. Once you throw some oysters in the body, even that local crackhead around the block collecting cans is looking kinda sexy. So, here is what I think.......  Before oysters                                   After Oysters Won't touch Joan rivers                      I will make her squeal like a mule Babara Walters                                  In leather, she will get DONE Fat chic from the  "facts of life "           I would record it for prosperity Mrs Garret                                        One word " Threesome " Leona Helmsley                                  ANAL ALL THE WAY BABY!!!!!  Shit, people better hope that I won't get oysters in my systerm and then get locked up with them before a sexual release.  Man , woman or a child three days short of an 18th birthday will get sooooo sexually violated that it is not even remotely funny.   Anyway, I am to battle traffic.  Peace, Love,   Take care  Fishdawg  Chuletas and rice baby!!!

       I did my best but my best wasn't good enough     Oh man,  urlLink The Last American Virgin  had to be the movie that " American Pie was based on. I forgot how funny that moviw was. I saw it when I was young and was amazed by the gratuitous breast shots and sex scenes. I was 11 and saw these girls walking around in naked and I should have known that 10 years later, I would be a full fledged pervert.  Anyway, did anyone notice on the top of the blogger that they have a link where to buy Puerto Rican Sovenirs( did I spell that right ?) I hope it is for everybody and not just by race.   So , here I sit in my living room with laptop on lap. trying to collect the various thoughts swirling in my head. I have this one thought floating that wants to explode but it would become a rant. Toda, I am not all about ranting. Today, I give you the " Pseudo-intellectual " side.  Last night was a good night. I was pretty happy with how everything turned out. I decided to go catch Mr Loudpoet himself "  urlLink Guy LeCharles Gonzalez  at the Pink Pony series at Cornelia last night. This was my first time there and I was expecting some serious intellectual poetry. I was expecting some Law professors reading some poetry filled with so many analogies, metaphors, that I would be blown away. Well, when you expect something, you get something different. Sure enough, it was different. I missed Guy's feature set but at least I was there to support. When I did get there, the open mic list had 29 people. THat is hands down crazy to have that many people. Then, 29 people getting to read two poems each, I have no clue how the fuck they pulled it off but they did. The series wasn't bad. It was just different.  Best part was when Iwas laving and I saw a great little roll cart in a weird place. Uh, the garbage to be exact. I looked at it, it was in perfect condition, into my trunk it goes.  It fits perfect for all my chapbooks and Cd's.  Headed over to the Nuyo with Rich and Oscar. After a battle with the parking Gods, we had somewhat of a Success. Got to that infamous Nuyo and the line was one step above retarded. So, I got into Salesman mode and went down the line and got to sell two CD's on the line.   Once inside, I set up a merch table to pimp myself as the whore that I am. Seeling Cd's is a fulltime job. You can't expect them to sell themselves.  The Slam last night was better then the bowery. I guess that some of the Poetry was more seasoned material then the " new " stuff they had to read at the Bowery regionals. The Nuyorican team took it once again. They did well and I have to give them credit. The set of the night had to go to Celena Glenn with the back up of Shawn Randall and Post Midnight ( congrats on the radio gig brotha ). she did a set in honor of the females locked in Rikers. It was crazy and she garnered a high of 28.3. I was stoked to see her do that well. Shawn dropped a good set last night with " How a poem sounds in his head ". I will never hear the words " dot and dash " and consider them normal again.  So, let me wrap this up.    I bumped into someone last night and I do have to admit that everytime I speak to them, I leave with something new. That is a person that you have to always treasure. Even if it is a simple gesture of kind words, they always leave you with something. I am glad that I gained a good fuckin friend. It makes you wonder that in the places where you never thought of finding a friend, that you gain someone with the potential of being special  Well, I am off to get a haircut today. I am even going to a party tonight and tomorrow a BBQ in Pennsylvania that I was invited to.  Have a great weekend  Peace, Love,  Chuletas a la BBQ  Fish

       Geriatric hanging out   When you have a whole bunch of poets go to a bar to bid farewell to another poet that is going overseas and the DJ removes the dust from his record collection and you still remember lyrics from 15 years ago, you are geriatric.  I am old and I am convinced that I fart dust. I am now headed to go buy some prune juice to mix with my metamucil. I am ordering some viagra just to make sure things keep working.  So, last night was the night that Ms Bassey ( I used to use my last name) was at Guernica celebrating one last evening with friends. It was nice to hang out with her and put a smile on her face. She is probably one of the most emotional people that I know, and I know that us being there was a good boost for her in her next endeavor. I am sure that she will second guess herself all the way until the lights go on. Of course, I am 100% sure that bassey will definitely kick ass. She will give a great show and do as she knows how. Go rock out girl!!! Do your thing!! From everyone that was there ( Lynnes, Oscar, Isle, Syreeta ( NOT SABRINA ), Maria, Peter, Matthew, we got love for you!!!!  So last night was the regionals at Bowery.  The whole thing that Bowery threw in was that you had to read a new poem.  I even read a new poem on the open mic and I feel good about it. I guess that the guys at the Nuyo felt it was appropiate to completely skirt that premise. So, the NUYO won and it made them the best!!!!! For about 3 minutes. After that, everything is back to normal. I got love for those Nuyo cats but they in some shit at Nats. They have a strong team and I look forward to see shit really get interesting in NATS. Matter a fact, I would love to see this.........  Union Square in first Bowery Takes Second Nuyo brings the rear.  I would say get the title of  "best poets" and say that NEW YORK CITY has the BEST POETS IN THE UNITED STATES PERIOD!!!!  That would be sweet, then again, also would be 60 million, 12 solid inches, and salma Hayek and Shakira and Lenny in a threesome. You can't have everything that would be sweet.   Well, I am off,   Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       Why is my blog like my Penis???   Because if it was ever cut off, I WOULD BE DEVASTATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hola people,   I am back and today's blog will be written by Fish's alter ego of " Sam "   "Hello,         My name is Samuel Vargas and I know all of you have encountered my other half known as " Fish " aka, FishDawg. How did he get a nickname from a nickname is beyond me. I know many of you have never heard of Sam but I will give you a quick synopsis of who Sam is.  I was born in 1971 in NYC, The Bronx. Unlike Fish, I had a great upbringing with two parents that went out of their way to make sure that my life had everything. I was taught to always be polite and respectful to my elders. I tried to always make friends and maintain a proper lifestyle within my neighborhood. I would walk the other way in fights and avoided any and if all confrontations. You know I got beat up alot once they caught up to me. I went to school in NYC and in Texas, unfortunately, Texas was a rough experience for me, the rascism was very explicit and the last straw that my dad took was when we woke up to a swastika spray painted on our front porch. I was really angry but happy we were coming back to New York. When I moved back to NYC, I moved into a building where in the apartment we took used to live " old Man Fish " , this Guy Angel on my Block started calling me " the new fish " and I didn't like that alot. I cried alot when they used to call me The " new Fish ". I even started getting beat up and would go home crying almost everyday. This guy Chauncey was a real bully and he was the one that made me cry the most. This guy Freddy beat me up in the elevator the first day he saw me in the building. This guy papito punched me in the face when we were playing football. Ruben hit me with a bat, Puto hit me with numbchucks, Louie wanted to cut me. Everyone was really picking on me and it hurt me.  "Uh Excuse Sam, Let me tell the rest of this story because you are truly acting like a bitch right now "   " ok Fish "  What's the deal people, you have to excuse Sam because he is still that little bitch nigga that used to get smacked on the regular basis.   You want o know how I came to be?? Easy, all these mothefuckers picking on Sam and making his life a living hell. The one day that I took over during a fight with some kats and I beat this guy to the ground, that is when Sam started getting some respect. You see, it wasnt sam that fought, it was me, FISH!!! Fish was the one that fought and earned his respect. Fish was the one taking lumps for these drunkards. Fish was the one that would always be there for anyone of his boys when they needed him. Fish was the one that fought back against Chauncey, Puto, Ruben, Ray, Pito, John, Boobie, Randy, Jerry, Louie, Hector. These were all Sam's friend but Fish Fought them to get Sam some respect.   You see this guys, Sam is the smart one with the ability to write. That motherfucker takes everything that I have done in life and puts it into that poetry and writing shit that he does. Well, I guess it's a good thing. I am kinda proud of him. Even though Sam is still a bitch.  " Can I say something now Fish? " " nope"  " Ok "  Well, time for Fish to run..... Gotta make believe I am doing some things... Peace, Love  Take care  Chuletas Guisa!!!!  >)))">  Shhhhhhhh..........   " hi again, this is Sam, don't let Fish scare you, he is really a nice guy. Just don't get on his bad side. Bye bye

       What do you call a cow with no legs????   GROUND BEEF!!!!!!!  Thank you ladies and gentleman, I will be here all week.  Oh man, good mood, good mood. I have missed you sooo much lately. It has been several days that my moods have been really bad and I tried something new in which  have not " stayed away " from people. It is not as hard as I thought.  Anyway, You know that I am going to talk quickly about Acentos Last night.  I mean quickly in the sense that I will not waste any time.   Acentos was honored last night to have the feature of Cheryl Boyce Taylor. This was easily ( To me ) the most personal and intimate Acentos to date. Cheryl means soo much to not just me but to the scene around her. She has done so much for poetry and to everyone in poetry that we have no room to say it all. Last night I was lucky enough to give her the Outro that she deserved. Where the words came from, I have no clue. I just spoke about the first things that came to me and it proved for a decent moment.   Our resident in Chef Maria took it upon herself to bake a cake for Cheryl. This has no words to describe. Maria probably single handedly made this whole event extremely special. I have to personally just say " Thank you ". After my outro and I asked Maria to present the cake to Cheryl and I pulled out the plates, spoons, ice cream, and The HUGE PUERTO RICAN COOKING SPOON, this was the best show for me in my books. Personally, I went home and just slept and relished that we are doing a good thing.  Oscar was great last night and I have to admit the " Acentos " has it's own personal style. We have cemented that in the eyes of many people that have come through. We have that comfy atmosphere that let's people be themselves. Proof is in the " ex-girlfriend chronicles" that Acentos os famous for. Also, First timers are treated as respectfully welcomed family members. I make sure that whoever is there for the first time knows that I appreciate them coming through.   I was really happy with yesterday's show. I am glad that our usual core audience came through and they did there thing on the open mic. I have to even be THANKFULLLLLL FOR THE POETS THAT COME THROUGH  but they don't read. Ed Garcia is the man on so many levels. He got me 30 Cde's and I have a goal to get rid of them before Nats. I know that is pushing it but we see what we can do.  so, back in sales mode.          urlLink 5 past 13  A little bit LOUDER: Poetry CD Volume 1 www.louderarts.com/cd You missed HBO Def Poetry Jam ??

       where are our priorities   Heaven sent voice has gifted us with 54 years of happiness 77 years of a life worthy of books An angel sings hearty rhythms with a spanish flare Fire in her blood Melody in her heart Culture and tradition her spirit We mourn her silence We suffer our loss Heavens gain their voice that we borrowed  Silence  Rounded face children crying for what they don't know Older women crying for the lost of a friend a staple a person that has come into our life through music Politicians, musicians, entrepeneurs all under the facets of " mourning " 2 horses agitated by the noise I carriage adorned with flowers and the cuban flag Where can we be righteous? Dignify in death as they have lived in life  Vendors sullying the memory of a legend selling Cuban flags Older men carrying boxes of sugar to throw on spectators yelling " Celia wants you " Shirts emblazoned with the face of " La Reina " sold for 20 dollars La Mega 97.9 giving out paper fans as memento's 93.1 following suit Now is not the time Or is it??? Not one corporate sponsor No bustello No Goya No El Pico  Our Mayor under the rain and annoyed by the lack of a proper umbrella Wails of " Celia , We love you ",AZUCAR, and the robust, " Que decanse in Paz " What is this for ? Have you loved her in life? Have you honored her correctly in death? For a funeral is to mourn, cherish, and remember. Was I here to mourn the funeral procession of a legend? or Was I here to enthrall myself in the circus of media hords?  Fish  Note: What I saw today really bothered me.

       I still got love for ya Seve!!!!!   So, the survivor slam came and went and it was to say " A good experience". I am going to  have a nice long blog so get ready to read.  WOW!!! Yesterday was one of those crazy days. It was a day when whatever could go wrong, it went absolutely wrong.  Poor Seve was all out of Whack yesterday. I can't blame the guy. He did his thing and tried 100% to make it. I guess that either with more practice or just him threatening the crowd, it will get better. I vote threats.Let's start off with the open mic.  The first guy up already set a precedent and dropped " A true Love Story ". Uh, He should have gone up there and read WAR and Fucking Peace. He stood up there for about 8 minutes. 8 Minutes on an open mic can be compared to one of those telemarketers keeping you on the phone when you are trying to watch that new porno you just brought. SO a couple of people almost reprieved the open mic and we had this " winner " named Phil. Ok folks, remember that I refuse to belittle a fellow poet. Rookie or pro, I will not say anything that will chastise their work.  I am just going to write what happened.  Phil goes up there and starts reading a poem about Gay people this, gay people that. He starts and repeats the  same thing ( primarily ) over and over again. Then, he starts with what gay people think of him, with what he thinks of gay people, people think he's gay. I never here My dreadlocked mentor heckle anybody, last night, she heckled. It was the funniest thing ever. The crowd got antsy, Our Dj even tried to give him a hint by playing music. The crowd started clapping to get him off but he was only half way through his piece. This guy pushed the issues last night. I say nothing about this. I just won't embrace this guy as a " poet ". He does need help. Lots and lots of help.  I was so happy last night that I got to meet Danny Solis. He was actually a very good feature and seemed like one hell of a guy. We spoke poetry and life and personally told me about the Latino showcase at Nats. I brought both his chap books and had him sign them. I came to my own concluson of Danny. He is cool with me. Until he proves otherwise, he rocked.  The survivor slam rocked. Last night was Ja'i, Rich, Cassey, Chance, Obona, Farbeon, Diane Roy, Lisa Ascalon, GinnaKarla ( She can cook like hell ) Nicholas. Oh, and the FishDawg himself!!!  oh man, I had one hell of a time. I joked and just made it for what it was. An awesome time.    The point of this slam was to give it a theme of " survivor ". The first 5 poets deaded in the first round become the new five judges and they score you in the seond round. I don't know about you all, but reading for other poets in slams scares me. Then, after the second round, the three deaded poets take over and they secret ballot you into oblivion.  Well, I could just write about me but I was more excited about all my peers and went up there and made it exciting. I have to say this, My motherfucking cuban brethren Rich is going to be awesome. He rocked this poem last night and he was so animated that I learned several things from him. Chance was chance and he did his thing as the norm. Ja'i should be allowed to write his poetry, his poetry is by far incredibly solid and it scares me knowing that he will be  ( I stress WILL BE ) Poet Laureate one day. Lisa did one of my most favorite poems and I want to so go after her one day in a slam. She did well and I was happy.   I went up and I actually used strategy ( to the ode of Oscar ). I always just figured that kick ass poems should give you the win. Not the case in many slams. I rode the score creep and gave them 110% of " yo soy del Bronx ". I made several changes at the end to make it a more generally loved and accepted poem. To my delight ( After I had to chase Oscar down to get my score because they didn't call it out ), I got a 29.0.  So, from the top of my head, in the second round, Judging me were Obana, Lisa, Cassey, Chance, Ja'i,   So, second round I go up last since I got the highest. I got some constructive critque from Lynne and I decided to go with it. I toned it down and just went with the poem. I don't think I toned it down enough but I did ok. I got high score again and I went to the third round.   Wow, third round people! This is where I  tell you. Fish has never made it to the third round so " handsomely ". At this time, the fun was kinda gone and the nerves kicked in. I still went after Diane did a pretty strong piece and dropped my " Death on Destructon day " piece. I only did half of the poem because I wanted to get over it. My stomach really pushed it this time. I am not used to it and I have to find out what the fuck these poets do for " post slam jitters ".  Diane took the slam after a secret ballot and I was happy that I made it that far. I think I could finally cement in my mind that " I'm a contenda ". I was busting diane's chops all week that I am busting her ass. She beat me by one vote. That is ok, wait until Diane hears my new work. I AM REALLY BUSTING YOUR ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL  NOTE: This slam was all about fun and that is what it was to be taken for, just fun. Don't let anything or anyone take something away from that. Work hard at it because it is a competition but have fun. Take the word seriously but still do it for the amusement and good nature of it. Being in the comapny of great poets, I was honored to be up there. Slams are nothing if you take them as a level of your work. I am not better then nobody else. I am a poet that will always support any of my peers work.  Old work or new, I value the fact that you even have a poem to share with strangers.    It is all about the craft, skill, word, and fun   remember that.  Well, I had a great time but I was fucked up afterwards. I guess it was something that I was not used to.   This was my 3rd slam at 13 and I think everyone knows. Fish is pretty solid.  So, Thanks to all the guys and gals that slammed with me and I look forward to the year end slamming..   Tonight is Acentos  Thursday is regionals at Bowery, Friday at the Nuyo, Monday back at 13.  Shit, Let me get to work!!!

       Monday morning befuddlement    Sexual things that befuddle me..........   When you go to the bathroom, you pee, you wash your hands. When you are with your girl, she goes down on you, you finish, then you kiss her. Why?  Why is bi-sexuality in women more accepted then in men? Why is there dialogue in porn? Why are women more visually enticed by a flaccid 9 inch penis that gains half an inch when hard but not with a 6 inch flaccid penis that gains 4 inches when hard?  Why do fat guys have small penis? Not that mines is small!!!!!! LOL    Religious things that befuddle me   Taoism Catholicism Lutheranism Buddism Christianity Jehovah witnessism sika ism Krishan ism  Where did so many different religions come from?     Girlfriend Questions that befuddle me   Why do they refuse to masturbate? or do they? Why do they hate porn? Why do they get mad when you request a threesome?   Poetry Question that befuddle me  Why is poetry so fulfilling but to just certain people? Why do so many people not aware of what true poetry is ? Why are poetry buffs so sexy?? including myself   Puerto Rican things that befuddle me  Why do we insist on gratuitously borrowing cable and then beef when there is nothing on the see??? Why do we always live in a building with family in another apartment? When Puerto Rican men decide to be unfaithful, why don't they leave, sisters, aunts, cousins out of the mix??? Why am I so sexy?   Peace Love Pork Chops  Fish

       Two's company, three's a definite good time   Que pasa People,  I am here at the household and I am doing slightly better today. I totally avoided the world this weekend because my bad moods are " Freindship " ending.   I wish my day was better because I missed Isle's CD release party and I heard that it was awesome. I hope that down the road, I would see her do her thing. Isle has a heart as big as Korea itself. I am glad that people went and supported her, she deserves it.  I am ok today, I have hit that " I don't care " milestone. I tend to hit this whe I realize that my life is what really matters. I have been working on on many things and I can't let things get in my way. I was talking to a friend and I think it is time to filter out the cancer's in my life. So , if you are a certain form of cancer, get ready for the chemo treatment and hope that your next victim would embrace you wholeheartedly. At this time, I can't afford anything that will keep me from growing.  I am actually working on a new poem with serious Historical relevance to it. It is about the revolt cry of " El Grito De Lares ". It was the cry of about 1000 Puerto Rican farmers in 1851 that revolted against spain and freed Puerto Rico. Even tough it was for 12 hours, that is all the freedom that we had. I say we because after researching and really consuming myself in this subject. I almost cried.Since the discovery of Puerto, we have been colonized, occupied, militarized, demonized, chastised, fucked, screwed. Get my point??? So, you have an idea of where my poem is going. Most likely, I will have it done when we come back from Nats. I am so excited for this road trip. We are going to have a Ball.   So, I am sorry for the calls I ignored. I just needed my time alone. Life is still good though.   Oh, I am slammin Monday in the " Survivor Slam ". I might get to even meet Danny Solis. One of the original Bad motherfuckers in Poetry. Guess  what, this might be my tpe of guy.  Ok, let me run,  Peace, Love  Take care I love ya like I love Pork Chops  Fish Dawg

       Why do I bother ?   Why do I bother being a freind when people insist on doing stupid shit ? answer this question!! I am righteous beyond all belief. I know that my life was not too cool when I was young but somewhere along the way, I treated others as I want to be treates. Respect me, appreciate me, love me, and just be true to me. All this and be true to yourself!!!!!!!  I am so fucking angry today and I can't probably even put it into words. I thought I would get over it but I realized that no matter what you do, people you care for will do whatever they want to do no matter how stupid the case is. They will fool themselves into justifying whatever they want to do.    Fuck it. If they don't like it, fuck em. I hate stupid people. Niggers have been fuck ups all their life and they have one moment of an epiphany and they are all better. Fuck that, you have been a fuck up and that means that your life has a trail of bad blood following it. You have to sit down and rectify everyone you hurt, screwed over, fucked up on.  You think that you meet this one chic and after you been with her not even a solid six months that you can just move in with her ???  YOu think that after 5 years on not taking care of your seed that you have rights after 3 months. You HAVE NO RIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!! You lost your rights with the 5 years you " chose " to be out of your seeds life. You are getting sick ad tired of being held at " bay ". Guess what motherfucker, you deserve it!!! YOu haven't done shit for your daughter and you expect reprieve in 3 months, nigger, you lucky that you even have this!!!!!!!!!   I am so fucking angry cause I can see the drama coming and I don't want to deal with it. I don't want to hear it. I am not in the mood. I am not!!!  I have been good and I have been even trying to work on my personal life and now I feel that my shit just took three steps back. Why does this situation bother me so much??? Why??? I should have never called. I should have never dialed the number. I should have never questioned anything. I should have just kept it general and not said anything.   People make mistakes ad I give them the benifit of the doubt. People fuck up and I am the first one there to listen to them.  Yet, can I be there time and time again???? Can I be there for them after I know they ARE GOING TO FUCK UP!!!  All I can say. PROVE ME WRONG!!! I have my " I told you so's" ready and cocked.   I am so not in a good mood. I am angry. I am hurt. I need to really hit something  I'm out

       ì Girl, I have about 9 solid inches to offer..........   Then of course, when the pants come down and you see about 5 hard inches of man meat, what are you going to feel ??? This is what I mean about gettting high expectations after hearing some incredible reviews about a move I caught yesterday.  Yesterday, I was invited to go see ì 28 days Later ì. The movie was a science Fiction Horror flick that the two reviews I got from friends had me itching to see it. This is where I should have known that the high expectations I set has already fucked the movie up for me. I love all type of movies but it is hard to have me jump and basically scare the ì bejesus ì out of me. I am thinking, ì wow, this movie could be the next Exoricist ì. This motherfucker wasnít even close to that. The movie was a decent horror flick but I left there kinda pissed that it wasnít world changing for me. I wanted to go home and be afraid to sleep. I wanted to have some nightmares that made my regular nightmares seem like walks in the park.   The movie had a good premise and the twist was kinda cool. Even though I felt the movie dealt much more with ì human nature ì then with the horrors of this virus  ( ì rage ì ), it had itís moments. The best part in the movie was this Linda Hamiltonish T2 Sarrah OíConor type chic named ìCelena ì. She was with this dude Mark and she saved another dude named Jim. They were attacked by the ì infected ì ( zombies ) and Mark was bitten. Celena asked him if he was bitten. The look on Markís face told it all. Celena had this machete and she went to town. She starting swipng at Mark and chopped off his arm. Then she must have swung at least 20 times. She killed him without even a second thought. Shit, that is my type of girl. I am thinking Mark is one of the main characters and he was killed off quick.   So, The movie wasnít ì off the hook ì to me. The movie wasnít ì One of the best ì to me. It was a good movie but the high bar I set just fucked it up for me. This is what happend when you listen to other people.  So, today I am home and I am going to go do some work on the Sentra. That little  car is about to become a racer if I keep tweaking it.  Oh, Good News, It is official. Rich Villar Jayme Del Rosario, and Jai will Uppercase at Bar 13 in August. Rich E-mailed me yesterday and he was pretty happy. I am happy for all three of them. If they play the cards right, they will reap some serious benefits.  I am going to ask Eric if I can throw my hat into the Hosting ring that day. I would love to host an Uppercase feature.   Ok, time to bounce and I am off to attack my day.  Peace, Love, Pork Chops  FishDawg

       Your mama wears combat boots!!!    I never knew why people would get upset if they were told " Your mama wears combat boots. Shit, if I could remember my mother with anything besides those mother " batas " and " Chancletas ", I would be happy.  Yesterday was a great day. I actually got 2 pair of socks and a new bottle of gel. Why?? After beefing about my socks being worthless, I was actually given some socks!!! Brand new and not used!!!!!!. So, Let me try something today.  Ok, here we go.  I woke up and had a horrible morning, my 2003 Hummer didn't want to turn on. My my live in supermodel turned pornstar left me.  The 60 million I had in the bank is gone!!! OHHHHHHH the Blasphemy!!!!!!  So, let me see what I could get by lunch today.  I am going to touch on something personal today. Yesterday I was surfing some blogs and I came across some " friends " topics. The people who you consider you best friends and what not. I am going to jump in the fray and just write what comes.  I am not going to talk about the past because I think it is worthless. I will give a quick mention though.   My Dawg E 1994 - Present....... This motherfucker is my heart. You know when you have one person in your life that he is like the model friend you hold everyone against??? This is him. We met through a mutual friend and the first day that we met, this little motherfucker did some shit to me that I should have laughed it off or punched him in the face. I laughed it off and I gained a friend that is priceless to me. This guy is beyond righteous. I have seen him swallow some things put against him in the interest of " keeping shit cool ".   When I was in a relationship, (How can I say this without having this used against me in a court of law??? ) Well, let's just say that My Ex owes alot to Eric. She is living a happy healthy life right now because Eric was there ( without even asking ) stopping me from going through some serious shit.  I turn to him to talk and he is by far the closest thing I have in my life. " I love you nigger "  My nigger Wil  1988- 1999.......... Wil and I were one unit. This guy was my heart and I would have given my life for him. We did everything from hanging, talking, fighting together, gettting locked up together. From 6am to 2am we were one. It came down to the point that it was " Fish and Wil ". This guy was my brother at one point and unfortunately, with time, that actually subsided cause he fucked up. I have been very hard on him over the years for the simple fact that his fuck up is " unforgivable ". Withing the last year, I realize that everyone makes mistakes and we have been talking here and there much more then before. I love this guy to death but he is still a piece of shit on so many levels.   1999 - Present  I have a few people in my life that I do care for and I have mad love for......  Oscar - I don't even have to tell you what this little napoleonic character means to me Stacie, Alice, Myra, Angie, Yesi, Jennifer, Ray, Puto, Ruben, Pito, Elbi,   I wish someone would come out with a question sheet of who you hate and why. That is when things of interest will come to be.   Ok, short Blog  Be good  Take Care  Peace, Love, Pork Chops and Apple Sauce  Fish

       You can have a bad day if...........   When shit just happens early in the morning.  Last night was a really relaxing night. I needed to rest because I was " Emotionally " spent from just too much going on. I get all worried that something is wrong but just need to recharge those batteries and I am good.  This morning, I wake up and I am feeling good. I got to bed early and walked through the minumal nightmares and I was good. I woke up this morning. Clicked on the TV  { insert morning ritual here }  Got out of bed and did the usual brush the teeth, shower, dry off, throw on some Body odor killer, lotion the mug, from here on end, shit just went down hill.  Firstly, what is the point of ear wax?? Can anyone tell me? Ever since we were little, we knew that ear wax had to be removed. I do this about 4 out of 7 days. I figure that it is best to remove it after a nice hot shower because it is all soft and such. THis morning, the medicine cabinet is opened, q-tip are removed, the chore begins. First the left ear, twist, twist, wiggle wiggle,remove, inspect, all  done. Now, the right ear. Insert, twist, twist, wiggle, wiggle, remove.....cotton is not there.  Ok, now this is where I am like, what happened??? Instead of sticking my finger in there and taking the chance that I could shove the cotton in deeper, I don't panic. I grab a pair of tweezers, stick em in my ear. AHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh................success. Cotton is removed. No problem. I was an EMT for a couple of years and panic is what fucks most situations up.   I am thinking, wow, that was funny. " ha ha, hee hee { Sarcastically of course }  I go to my living room to throw on the socks , pants, shirt and everything else. Ever notice, as we get older, we carry more. I am carrying a back pack for no reason more then " just in case ". Anyway, I sit, leg up, left sock goes up. No problem. Right leg goes up, toes curl, sock goes up, rips right in half!! is this even possible. Can my socks suck anymore ??? I have a death wish with socks people. I have no discipline with socks at all. When I wash, I don't match them. I don't care. Who is going to look at my socks anyway. Will I dry them and get mad because I am missing a sock?? NOPE!! All my socks are white!!!!   My socks are a story by themselves. If you ever seen my calf's ( or calves ), they are huge. This is funny because my socks are all stretched open at the mouth. I don't have one pair of decent socks. I only have " one" pair of black socks to go out that I throw on with my shoes. Why do I need black socks, All I wear is boots. Black socks are for shoes. I don't even own a decent pair of shoes. The shoes that I do own are about 9 years old but they look new. Why???? I never wear them.  So, A q-tip almost making me deaf, My socks dying before my eyes....... my day just might be bad today. Actually, it is hard for me to have a bad day.   It just makes me kinda wonder why things go awry so early in the morning. We are all so ritualistic in the morning and the first thing that throws us off, our day is all out of whack..  then again, my days are whacky everyday.  Ok folks,  Peace, Love, BBQ pork chops  Take care  FishDawg

       Where was I????   That is probably what most of the masses that grace my blog were wondering yesterday. I was hanging out with a friend that came up from Florida that I have not seen in 11 years. You know what, that is not even important right now. I have to get into what happened last night.   Last night were the team slams at Bar 13. You all know that Team Union Square -vs- "shoulda been Urbana" -vs- the virtual newcomings of " Team Acentos ". For some reason, I love the sound of that, Team " ACENTOS "!!!!!!  Oh man oh man...... I was so excited and I felt like a little kid going to rye Playland ( because Great Adventures is too far and expensive ).   On our team was Rich Villar. This cat is coming on strong and even though I just have known him for a few. I can say, I am proud of him. He took the role of " Slammer " and I know that he worked it. " Rich, I know you are reading this because you are one of my dedicated stalkers, I am proud to say that it was a pleasure to slam on the same team with you"  Jaime Del Rosario was also on our team. This incredibly perky and talented writer was a sure fire God  SEND to our team. She worked hard on a poem  and switched it up and tapped into a well of comedy and humor that had her a winner in her round. SHE beat out Roger and Lynne's " Ode to Rita Marley ". This, for a person that didin't want to slam, it was worth it. " Jayme,  you rock.  Next, Oscar Bermeo. Our coach. Our workshop faciltator of sorts. He put this team together and made the small changes that did nothing but make our poems  " gooder ". He reached for the sentimental vote and sure enough, he got a great score. I will post the scores on an Edit when I get home tonight.  Next on the team was..... uh...... shit.......... Me.!!!! Fishdawg the fucking poet got on the stage and busted out his " Headlines " piece. I drew first up and going first is almost " judgemental Sucide " Those judges are not going to give out straight up " 10" to the first poet in the first round. BUT THEY WILL GIVE " 9 " across the boards!!!!!! LOL ( 27.6 total )  I mean, we went up against the best of Bar 13 Team union Square 2003. This was Roger, Lynne, Marty, and Tai. The next team from Urbana was Taylor Mali, Shappy, RAC, Dawn Saylor.  After the guns were emptied. Team Union Square took first. Acentos took Second. Urbana brought up the rear. So, I am estatic going home after beating Urbana and Giving Union Square a run for their money!!!!!! I was soooo excited last night. It was fun and I learned alot.  I took a shit load of Pictures and I hope to get a few digital one's sent to me also.   So, this is the part where I reflect. Last night, I was in the company of some of the best poets on the scene if maybe ........... period. Going up against these guys has given me something that I never had before. A sense of being " worthy " to hang with the big boys ". I completely admire and respect all the poets and for giving me ( us ) the chance a year or two ago. I will always say this, Louder ( past and present ) embraced me and taught me more then I ever would have thought.  Time to learn and maybe even love.  Thank you again.  Peace, Love  Take care  Porkchops in Sauce  FishDawg  >)))">

       What time is it?....... OH GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!!!   These were the words that came out of my mouth when I fell asleep at 5:30 in the morning and people decide to wake up at that time!!!!!!   So, Yesterday was the CD release party for 5 past 13: A little bit louder, volume 1. It was at "BarBelow " on Smith street in Brooklyn. I was very skeptical half way through the evening. Most people came and went when they heard and saw the $10 dollar cover at the bar. It was the fault of louder, it is a free bar and many of people hang out there when it is free. Now, thye have to pay ten dollars?? Masses of folks came and went. Hey, but believe it or not, we did well. The place was packed. In the middle of the night, a poetry showcase to plug the CD was formed. It didn't go off that well because WAYYYYYYYYYYY too many people were yip fuckin yapping. I had to go outside before someone got their jaw broke.   Once Frank ( our very own DJ hotnuts ) came over and took over DJ duties. He fucking killed it. I mean that in a good way. He ripped the music most of the night and I had a hell of a time. I actually danced. Fish actually got on the dance floor and danced. I avoided all fat chics and gay men. I wasn't trying to deal with drama. I did meet this hot model chic that tried to tongue me down most of the night. Can you hear that???? Could you hear certain blood pressures starting to boil??? I was JUST JOKING!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL  After the party, we headed to Ginna's house and munched on some awesome breakfast that Raymond " the sensitive " one made. He can actually cook. I am impressed.  oh, Ginna house has it's own zipcode. They are shooting an episode of " MTV cribs " next week and her houe will be on it.   So, since I had my own futon, I was sleeping like a baby. That model chic kept on licking my neck but I kicked her out. Hear it again ??? LOL  Great weekend, Great time,  Oscar, Rich, Jamie, and myself practive and did some edits for our upcoming slam against the other fuckers on Monday. We did some shit to my Headline piece that I was loving. Oscar really showed me a different side this morning. I think we are going to do well. I know this much, if we beat them, life is going to suck for some people.  110% is how we are going at it.  Ok, let me bounce, I have to et this model chic home. Wait, here is again ???? LOL  Relax ma, I am just messing with ya.  Peace, Love, Poerk Chops  FishDawg  Take care

       Chuck E. Cheese old school   so,  could tell you that today was a great day. I was at Chuck E-Cheese. Yes, me, geriatric old ass Fish was at Chuck E Cheese playing like a little kid. It was the best too. Best part, I am sitting there eating with these young bucks that I was sitting and who comes up to me????? MY Estranged God daughter!!! She comes up to me and looks at me and says.......... " Hi " . I was shocked. I haven't really interacted with her over the years and that has been my fault. Well, that is a private journal entry. It just felt good to see her and the better part of it was that she came to me to say hello. Life is good.  Pues, by this time, you all probably are aware of how good I felt yesterday about the Rikers Showcase and everything. I was completelystuck on stupid when I left there and my conversation was at a minamal. I had these feelings that I never had before going through my body. I felt like crying 98% of the way home. Oscar was giving some serious accolades and that was one hair fiber from making me pull over and just cry. A loser and failure the majority of my life and now here I am, considered a success in this workshop.  Guys were saying things to me that I never thought I would be on te receiving end of hearing.  I got really attached to them motherfuckers. I hope and wish them the best once they are released. I am not to worried about them fuckin up. I am more concerned about them working hard to become great writers.  Yesterday was the day in which I totally cemented louder in my heart. Roger said some shit at the end of the class that woke me up and left me fucked up. I think that is when it started. I wanted to be alone immediately afterwards but I have responsiblities. So, I kinda shut down and stood quiet. So much was going through my head and I had to let it sink in.  So, we are off to the party today and I should be there by 9pm. I will be in somewhat blouncer mode but I am going to have fun.

       Spit or Swallow?????   Ahhhhhhhhhh yes folks, here is the age old question. Cum this Monday, it will either be "spit" some serious poetry and kick some ass in the " league of undignified commoners " slam or I " swallow" my pride and just do what I had to do. Uh..... what were you thinking you pervs??? I am beyond writing about blowjobs everyday. If you were a member of my Fishism list, you do recall my endless search for the perfect oral satisfying moments of my life. Let this be known, I am beyond.  So, yes, Like I said Monday will be Team Acentos vs Team Union Square vs team Shoulda been Urbana. This is probably the closest I would ever get to compete on a national level.  Out of like twelve people in this slam, may 9 or better have national experience and a shitload of Slam experience. This is the part where I let Oscar run the show since he knows a little more then what I do. It is all a learning experience and I can't wait to get my feet wet.  Pues ( this means  " well "  is Spanish for you non-spanish blog stalkers ). I got a room in the wicker park inn in Chicago for nats. Let's see who wants to crash. I will be charging 20 bucks a night for floor space. Fuck that, the room came out to a couple of bucks and I am not running a freebie convention. So, if you are a guy, bring KY because I you are paying up one way or the other. Oh, if you are female, hee hee, don't mind the video camera on the tripod with the night vision. The handcuffs, duct tape, ball gag, and assorted leather whips are for entertainment purposes. Oh, Thanks to Guy for the link for the wicker park link, " you da man "  Tonight is the showcase at Rikers and I feel pretty happy about everything. I hope that  everything goes well. I am not in a mood for nonsense today. Bringing this second group to Rikers means that my dedication to this program has been 110% from the begging and I hope that I will get more opportunities in the future with different organizations. I have become so attached to these guys because we  ( everyone that has taught ) has gotten these guys to write. They are appreciating spoken word, poetry, performance poetry, workshops. We have introduced them to sooooooo many different writers.  Teaching has been the best experience I have ever had. I gave back to the community in which at one point I was a part of. If something in my life would have never changed, I might have been a student instead of an instructor.  One thing , I could have never gotten this done without the support of the likes of Oscar, Roger, ALL OF LOUDER!!! Even the ones that hadn't  looked nor touched the rikers project. They helped in more ways then they know. The poets who have taken time out of their life to trek it over there to perform have given me a new meaning to pursue even more in poetry.   Thank you guys.  Was this sappy enough???   Ok, no more sap....  Time to bounce and bid ya ........... PEACE!!!!!!!!!!    Peace, Love, Pork Chops  Fish ( I knew you were all thinking dirty ) dawg  >)))">

       Boxers or Briefs????    " Hi, my name is Sam and I wear hot pink things"   What's the deal people!!!!!! I am back in the job and I am doing great. This morning, I am riding to work and I am reading the Daily news and I come acorss those " Dear Abby " type columns. The girl was writing because she was losing alot of friends because of her on line journal ( Blog ). Wow, I never heard of an on-line journal. I never even knew that you could do that. Anyway, This girl was losing friends because of the things that she was writing. Her anti-war views and everything else were putting her in awkwards positions. I say this........     Dear girl that is losing friends because of her blog "                  If your friends read your blog and they decide to cut you off, those were not real friends. If you can not have your own views without having those people judge you, you don't need them. You need people in your life that will accept your views for what they are , YOUR Views. They dont have to agree with them, but they can accept you. So, all in all, FUCK em!!!!     Last night, I got an invite to the Nuyorican. I was tired and not really digging the fact that I would be getting another night of a two hour sleep cycle. Here is the kicker, I had this feeling that it would be a good thing to just go. Sure enough, I did not regret it. They started the slam early because a PBS production company was there recording the slam. After the slam, special performances by Willie Perdomo, Mayda DeValle, Slanty eyed Mama, Danny Hoch. I was in Poetry heaven for five bucks. Well, actually, more like poetry purgatory because the cd recording at 13 was off the hook and no show has come close to that!!!!  The slam was good and it was good to see different voices on the mic. Out of 20 slammers, I only knew one. That is a good thing. Carlos Gomez, one of the members of nuyorican 2003 team was there and he took first in the slam. Yet, he did the admirable thing and gave up the slot because he already made the team. So, keeping this crown would have been worthless because he couldn't be on the team again. So, some white guy named " Lamb " took second and the opportunity to take part in a friday slam. As the vulture that I am , I got Carlos info for some things I would like for him to do.   All in all, Willie Perdomo is a hands down master at what he does. I can't explain how a simple changing of the tone of your voice will bring a poem to life. Mayda did her thing and she is so awesome. Funny thing, I didn't go and say hello. I met Mayda about 6 times and that connection is still lacking. She did her thing and she is truly an awesome poet. As I am writing this, I am noticing something that many of you probably already have noticed. I tend to give my dues and props to all poets who are of Latino descent. I can't even deny this. When I first started coming to this scene, I felt that there were not enough latino voices around. That of course changed with Oscar breaking down doors, me following suit, and many others after me. I have nothing against a poet who is not latino but I will support my Hispanic brethren as hard as I could. I can tell you that there are some latino poets that will make it big. They have their own style, way with words, and a dedication to getting to the top. Mark my words, watch for a selected few.  So, with last names like Bermeo, Gonzalez, Villar, Rojas, Perdomo, Rojas have ,and ,will go down as awesome latino poets.   So, my day is here and I am good. We have one day to practice for Team Acentos taking on the powers that be on Monday. I can't wait, it is going to be fun. I would love to beat them. Yet, I would love to just have fun and practice to get better.  On that wonderful ecclectic notes  Time to bounce  Peace, Love  Take care  Fish ( I am a proud, strong, latino man ) Dawg  p.s did I ever mention that I do have a hot pink thong fetish???   That is a whole other blog!!!!!!!

       Speed Stick or Degree   First thing, if you called my cell phone at 1:35am and I didn't pick up, what do you think was happening at that time??? Sleep you idiots!!!!!!!!!!  Damn.  Anyway, here is the funny little things that make my life great. Yesterday, I did my ritual of waking up showering and all that hygenic stuff that we all have grown accustomed too. So, Lenny left a degree anti-perspirant and when I ran out out of mines, I started using hers. Here is the funny part, yesterday, I was a walking " roll -on anti-perspirant " experiment.  I used the last bit of the degree and I got only enough for one armpit. I opened up " Speed stick " and threw that on. So, degree on one armpit and speedstick on the other. Talk about an interesting day. The winner of the " Fish has no life and decides to do this award " goes to..........  ( drumroll )   SpeedSTICK!!!!!! I had one sweaty armoit all day and that degree is going to be sued by me for false advertising.   So, Acentos has come and gone. Yesterday was ...............  " Different ".  Our feature was stuck in Chicago and at 5pm, she was at Newark NJ.  I knew she wasn't going to make it when I heard that. Sure enough, Our open mic and break came and went and we have finally had our first Featureless Acentos. Regardless, the optimist in me says taht it was all good. We had a good crowd of 22 people and I was happy. Best part of the evening, Rony ( owner of the Blue Ox ) has installed an air conditioning and I was happy as a polor bear on ice.  I was happy yesterday, nothing mind bending and Oscar didn't get on my nerves and vice versa. So, all in all, the night was great.   I am going to start working on a " work in progress poem " called " she sings ". I dabbled with it and I think it has potential. I read some little blurb that I wrote and I have realized that my vain attempt at humor will not occur on a regular basis.  All in all, good evening. I just woke up with a headache. I took some advil and the tumor should go away soon.  Take care  Peace, Love  FishDawg  >)))">

       Actual Blood family sucks!!!!!   Ok, the Demon spawn bloodsucking leaches have arrived from Puerto Rico via driving from Florida.  They were not even in NYC yet and they made my life a living hell. I was at home catching a nap because I was tired. I got up and took a quick shower and I was walking out the door and sure enough, my dad was walking to my door with this face like " oh, you are going to et mad ". Sure enough, these people called and they were on the NJ turnpike. I asked my Dad where. He doesn't know. I asked them what time they called, he doesn't know. I asked them if they know how to get to the house, he doesn't know. I love my father with such a fervor that nothing can beat that, but Pop, you were worthless to me yesterday. The only thing that made life easier was that they called from a cell phone and I got to call them back ( via caller ID ) from my pops cell. I told them to get off in the first visually enticing exit in the BRonx and I met up with them with my Dad in tow. Now, the family in question is my mothers Borther. That motherfucker is not my uncle. My uncle is someone that calls me and I call them. Treats me like family and I treat them like family. I have seen this guy about 3 times in my 32 years of life. So, I am closer to some of the Louder Folks that I have seen everyday then this Balding arrogant bastard that I never see. You know I am going somewhere with this.  This motherfucker gets in the car and he starts quick with some typical Puerto Rican Peer pressure nonsense........  " So, how long you been married?" " Wow, you are fat " " you are not married?, you need to get married because you are not getting any younger " " Are there casino's here, I promised to take my wife, ( I interject and tell them there is one about 3 hours away ), I promised to take my wife, can you drive us ?" " WHy don't you have kids ?"                Note: I have a brother that gay, so, guess what THIS MOTHERFUCKER  says........  " I hope you ddidn't come out like your brother, you never are going to have kids like that "  PEOPLE!!!  10 minutes in the car and I have never regretted the fact that I never have seen this guy for more then 4 hours in my life!!!!  Now, here is the kicker, guess where I am driving to either tonight or Wednesday night??? Yep, my mother called me and pulled out the " I never ask for anything " card. Oh man, I love my moms but these are the times when I feel like moving to Florida now instead of next summer.  The majority of my life, it has been Pops, moms and me. No uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, neices etc. My Abuelita from my Dads side was the only one that I loved more then life. When she died, I lost all my connections to those Puerto Rican dissidents residing on that small island of Borinquen.   So, can you tell I had a horrible night last night.   The best part about anything was that when I got to Louder ( bar 13 ), I started feeling a little bit better.  I actually took place in the slam last night and that made my mind at ease. It was a good night and I felt sooooo much better after some poetry and looking at Eric G dressed in drag ( Don't ask ).  Last night was the cover slam in which you had to read a poem by someone else. I chose to read " Miguel Pinero's, The book of genisis according to San Miguelito ". I did ok, I got 9 's across the board. The high 9's still beat me out. Roger, Regie Cabico, Obena, Oscar took home books and money. Oscar took the the triple threat with a Poem by Jimmy Santiago Baca.  Can lose when you reading Baca.  So, I got to work early today and I feel good. I am going to be a little bit busy so my e-mails are kinda limited today.  I am linking Oscar's page for you can see some info for the Party on Saturday, we are going to PARTY HARDCORE!!!!!!!!   urlLink Party Info!!!   Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       Calm.....cool.....time to stir minds   How many of you are fully commited in a relationship right now? How many people can wake up and say " wow, somebody loves me"?. Well, here  is something to make some people think and maybe evenchange just a little.  Normally, I would write every detailed nook and cranny " about why I am feeling this way. Since I have sooooooo much repect for some things, I will remain silent. Yet, I will pose some hypothetical's for you.  I have been in many relationships and the majority of them have gone south. I don't mean an excellent fun filled vacation neither. I mean straight to the brimstone depths of hell. Realtionships have proved difficult and maybe almost impossible for me. It has come to this point, within a year or two when I do decide to date or whatever, I will give a fair warning, I am not good at relationships. I tend to get scared several months into them and run like a coward with a yellow stripe down my back. Funny thing is, I have alawys maintained an excellent friendship and course of cordialty with the majority of my ex's. Some have even become my best friends of sorts. Except for that mentally challenged fool ecuadorian kettle of confused emotions that I actually cut off recently.   Why can't some people be friends after the breakup??? I pose this question to female and males alike?? I have no qualms nor dissention after a relationship to put everything behind me. Some people find that too hard. Some people think that is not fair. Some think that it is selfish.  THe most hurtful words that anyone ever told me when I was breaking up with them were " if we are not together, then what do you want me around for ?"   I couldn't answer then  I could answer now. When you have family you have support. When you have friends, you have a group that will push you. When you have someone that has the potential of becoming your shoulder, your ear, your life. That is more important then anything else that I could see. Thing is, how can you not be with someone you were with and have them be so important in your life? I don't know, if you have the answer, let me know.  My life is very complicated right now and the only reason why it is like this is because I made it so.  I have made sacrifices in the name of " search ". I hope that my search this time will be a right one. If I fucked up, I wouldn't give much a chance after it.  Well, short blog,   Peace, Love,  Take care   Fish  >)))">

       Please help me!!!!   I was forced into the world of "   urlLink Superman  " while trying to avoid the "  urlLink Great American Scream Machine " of "  urlLink MEDUSA " while she was almost killed by a " Runaway Train ". One of Medusa's " Vipers" spit some poisionous "  urlLink NITRO " onto "  urlLink Batman  " when he was trying to save me but "  urlLink Batman and Robin  " from the Chiller prooved worthless.  Did I do well????? I tried to described all the major rides that almost killed me today.   Yes, my old geriatric ass made a trek to Great adventures today. My buddy called me late last night and as spontaneous as we can be, at 9am this morning, we were in Great adventures. I know I know, it was stupid to go on a weekend and a holiday one at that. Well, for your funky little information, Great Adventures was as empty as a crack whores black book trying to find a job. Nobody was there compared to the times when I usually go. From 10am to 12:30, we already have jumped on all the rides that I have mentioned. the only ride where I waited for 15 minutes was the " Superman " ride. Which was completely crazy to let you know. Hands down, " Nitro " was still the best ride in length and excitment. The ride that had me shocked was that " Viper "!!!! This thing was choppy and it was just throwing me all over the place!!!!!!!! Hence, maybe that is why they call it the " viper ".  I couldn't get over at how empty this park was. We were just walking up to all the rides and just basically walking in and jumping on. I think this is the only time that I am kinda digging this recession. Great Adventures is expensive as fuck folks. Make sure you get those coupons and coke cans and go during the week. Maybe that is why it was empty. It was a beautiful thing just walking on and not waiting on those welfare lines ( FLASHBACKS!!!!!!!!!!!!).  So, time for me to shower and do my thing. I am the early shift this week at work.  Time to go.  Peace,  FishDawg  >)))">    Peace.   urlLink

       Perfection   Impressario on grill, Salad Aficionado creating heaven, stragglers amongst us and what do we have ???? The un offical " Louder " BBQ kicking all tri-state area ass!!!!!!!  A few of us got together and got the essentials for making this BBQ take off and make it at least somewhat decent.  At 3pm, the grill was assembled and the coal was thrown on and with one match, " on gaawa aawa.......we have fire "!!!   NOTE: get the matchlight coals, them suckers light up with no lighter fluid and it makes life easier.  The porkchops and sangria( prepared by the ever so sexy Jayme ), this salad that still had me salivating early this morning. The sultan of salad, GinnaKarla threw this mix together as diligently as she does her poetry. I can't explain how good it was. I grabbed a plate before the food and I couldn't get over the explosion of taste in m mouth. Ginna is unabatedly " The Bomb ". So, to the preparers of the food, Oscar ( Fruit choppin slugger that he is )Bermeo, Maria ( I am a chef and I don't need to be cooking more) Nieves, Ginna, Jayme, oh....... and me. I got the chicken ready and I really should have seasoned it much more.  The day was hit off perfectly with a little bit of everything being brought from all different angles at the hours through the evening. Marty lugging her melons ( insert bad thought here ), Helen Yum making it the OFFICIAL BBQ when she brought her Macaroni Salad. She is awesome. Lynne bring some of the weirdest things to a BBQ that  I have ever seen but sure enough, they were needed. This is what makes her great, that whole ability to see what others don't see. " Lynne, I need lotto numbers ". Ray carrying some burgers from 83rd street and Jai bringing some of his veggie garden burgers. Eric showed up in some surfer shorts with no shirt tugging bags of ice. I would kill to see Eric get waxed. If Eric gained about 100 pounds, he could look like " George the Animal Steel with all that fur!!!  I think the best part of the day was to see Cheryl Boyce Taylor show up. She is sooooo genuine and loving. Seeing her there enjoying all the food and laughs is what made the day great for me.  I took the first shift at cooking and it was pretty cool. I volunteered to " chef it out "  and I don't mind that. The best part were those pork chops. OH man, enough  spices to make your mouth water. When the food was done,  I made the  " Pig yell " (Soooooooooweeeeeeeeeeeeeee ) and everyone grabbed a plate. The second shift was a joint effort between Eric, Raymond, and Oscar. I was done cooking and the smell of smoke got me pretty much drained.  Funny thing was when eric was grilling and the whole grill caught fire and he tried to save the meat. He looked like an extra from the movie " Backdraft " trying to save dying kids from the raging inferno. Either that or one great blunder waiting to happen. He managed to save the meat and all was well at The " bbq " .  I had to make my exit about 6:30 pm. I would love to have stayed to enjoy the food and maybe even help with the clean-up. Thing is, the 4th of July is not a good holiday for me. I went through some shit years ago and the 4th of July has opened a flood gates of emotions. I have always managed to hide my emotions very well. The 4th is a year in which I have to hide them the hardest. I lost it the year after my accident and every year after has been a task. I have gotten better but I still tend to get very mellow. People tend to always ask me what is wrong and I don't like being around people when I am kinda depressed. I don't even think of it as depression all the time. I think of it as just thinking too much. So my defense mechanism is just being alone.   The BBQ was great and it was really like the first time that I hung out with these people like this. I hope that many more days will follow.  I saw T3 ( terminator 3 ) this morning. It was a pretty good movie. Very action filled. Take care and be well    Peace, Love   Fish  >)))">

       The world is safe   I am in my house and today was the day in which I have realized that poetry is what you make it. Yesterday was the day of the Dark Future slam. I had an incredible time. Taylor Mali is hands down a bonafide nutcase with a creative energy on top of tooooooo much ample time!!!!   Yesterday, the Corporation consisted of  urlLink Agent Mali , Agent Saylor, Agent Neil, and  urlLink Agent Bermeo  and several other Bowery stragglers. The slam consisted of 12 people in which only Poems envisioning a dystopic future were allowed. You would have to recite your poem under one of several conditions alotted to you. The conditions were a miriad of straight up crazyness!!!!!!!!!  Hands tied behind your back Wearing a hood over your head ( I got stuck on this one ) Music blasted in your ear Water thrown in your face they would take you some where in the back and shine lights in your face  and a whole bunch more  I was second up and I had a gut feeling that this hood thing was going to be given to me. Sure enough, that shit was no joke!!!! I had on a long trench trying to look the part. So, I go to the stage and the hood goes over my face. They put me in front of the microphone and I start my piece.........  30 seonds later I start going into overdrive in the poem for a buildup to the climax. PROBLEM: The buildup means breathing hard is proving a chore and that hood wasn't so kind with the oxygen. 1 minute into the poem and with every breathe, the cloth of the hood would go into my mouth. The heat was rising in the hood, the bad breathe was getting me dizzy. So, when my pause in the poem came and everybody was clapping, I said FUCK that .... I WAS DONE!!!!! It was about 600 degrees under that hood. I started wheezing. My breathe was atrocious!!!!!!!!!!!  so, a 7.5 later.......I was happy as a pig in shit when that hood came off ******************  This note is from the Revolutionary front called " FREE the WORD " Last night, we, members of free the word toppled the corporation and they have buckled under our passion to keep the word free.  FREE THE WORD!!!!!!!!! FREE THE WORD!!!!!!!!! FREE THE WORD!!!!!   ************************************  That was the best part of the evening!! I was recruited to be part of " La Resistance " . We all rushed the stage and a gun point, we made the corporation our bitches!!!!!  This was hands down the best night I have ever had in Poetry. No winners were declared in this slam but I knew I wasn't  going to win. Yet, I had fun and that was what I was going there for.   I have found a new found respect for Taylor and everyone putting this together. They had every nook and cranny taken care of. Cameras recording the audience and the poets, A digital camera to take pictures, a projector, and everything just fell into place.  I might not have won the slam but I have another piece in the memory bank. At least I know, be ready for anything when you are participating in a Mali Production.  Great time. Great People.  Thanks for all the Louder Stragglers that showed up. Thanks for all the Supporters that showed up.  Thank you Lenny for coming to take pictures and keeping this history of my spoken word career on track  Monday.............. Cover slam and Rob Neil as Feature!!!!!!!!  Peace, Love  I AM GOING TO A BBQ!!!!!!!!!!!!  Take care  Fish  >)))">

       Fear and phobias   Ok, you all know that not much out there can really instill fear in my heart. I even have a poem blasting fear as a product that fails to move me. I was bullshittin you all. Some of you might know, some of you might not.   I can't explain how much I am scared to death of  urlLink Waterbugs . These little damned insects will have me squirming and maybe even curling into the fetal position and sucking on my big thumb. I have always availed myself as a badass. A dude can come to me with a gun and a knife and it won't phase me. He pulls out a waterbug and I will let him fuck me if he wants. I am terrified of them things!!!!!!  When I was young ( 3 or 4 years old ), I lived with my parents in the typical ghetto tenement building. Old decaying walls, garbage everywhere, no real Air conditioning but a shit load of fans. My mother always used go into the kitchen and kill three or four waterbugs before starting her wifely duties of cooking for my pop. I remember on many occasions, she used to grab the waterbugs by the antenna and chase me around the house. I used to crawl under my bed where she couldn't get me and emerge about an hour later. I spent alot of my childhood under my bed. That is why I never believed in monsters under my bed, I spent more time down there then what they did. With that staunch memory being in the dome, I grew up with this fear of waterbugs that I can't shake. It has gotten so bad that I might even move if I see one in my apartment.   Last night , I was talking to a friend of mines that I called back and she left a message on my machine that said she just finished killing 4 waterbugs and that she was chasing one down.  I called her back and left a message and told her that I will never, ever, no way in fucking hell visit her. Don't offer me dinner, a drink, coffee or ass or three days of non-stop sex. There is absolutely nothing that will get me to her house. Matter a fact, I won't even go into her neighborhood.  My moms did a number on me when I was young. She chased me around with Octopus also. Have you ever seen an Octopus getting cooked?? It looks horrid. So, she used to take it out to remove the outer skin and she chased me around with it, so, under the bed I went. It was kind cool down there sometimes.   I love my moms but she is solely responsible for half the nutcase things I have done!!!! LOL. My moms is a comedian with a bad temper with a slight pshychological edge on normal people. Her idea of teaching me how to cook was making sure that I thought that cooking was like playing a game or having fun. She would challenge me to a race to who can clean their respective rooms first.Ironing was  a privledge and not a chore. Sweeping and mopping was something that only " little special kids get to do ". Yea, special in that little yellow school bus type of way.  So, this weekend is the 4th of July and I am not too crazy about going out but I am hitting this BBQ. Gotta get some food up in the system. I am the designated cook in the Prospect Park shindig tomorrow early. I have to call and get details.  So, I hope you are all going to have fun and be safe. Remember that we still are living in some fucked up times. So, just be safe.  Oh, also, SIGN THE GUESTBOOK YA BASTARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Say something.... say you love me, want me, hate me, admire me. Say happy gay day or something.!!!!!!!!!!  Peace, Love  Take care,   Fish  >)))">

      no chances  well, I am not taking any chances. I am actually writing this on Microsoft word and copying it to my blog. I canít tell you enough that this morning I got profound, political, and intellectual and my blog didnít post. I was hurt. I was going to write about it again but then, I realized that it was not worth it or maybe even meant to be.  So, I am back from almost grabbing a cup of coffee with a fellow poet. I really thought that we were going to stop at least at a StarBucks and grab a cup of Joe. Sure enough, an interesting walk ending in Central Park was the start of a good conversation.  Today, We touched on Slam, Poetry, Life in this scene, relationships, life, goals, endeavors, and the current situation of our lifestyle.  I have been around several people and had great conversations concerning poetry.  I never specifically meant with anyone just to talk about it. Today was cool. We spoke about alot concerning about ourselves in Poetry. We told each other our starts, accomplishments, loveís, and future plans for poetry.  A breathe of fresh air??? Hope amongst our peers? I have no clue how to start or even explain.    What stuck out most in my mind was the topic of conversation of ì how people judge poetry by the likability (is that a wod )of the poet. A couple of months back, I was pissed over the quick across the board judgement of some peopleís poetry by other people that really have no right to judge.  We were on the same page that people need to have class and a certain respectful tinge. There are some people on the scene that are truly fuckin assholes but I will give them credit when credit is due when it comes down to their work.   Another topic that we grazed through was the perception of certain venueís. Unfortunately, she was on the money with some things but understandable enough, we work hard and that falls under the umbrella of envy of many other people.   Things were said like...........  ì write for you and the love of poetry ì ì Donít write just for the sake of slamming ì ì Write and always perform to 110% of your ability ì ì You do you ì ì The bar that you set was high, still, write and realize it for what it is worth ì   As I write this, I have to say that I am happy that I gained a friend and I look forward in supporting them and working with them. From about the 4 hours of talking that flew by incredibly quickly, I will deem that time, formidably impressive.    This morning, I posted a blog that didnít go through because it was too long. So I am just going to give you a quick overview of what I felt.   As of yesterday, The New Jersey State Assembly has passed a bill eliminating and abolishing the New Jersey Poet Laureate position. Amiri Baraka was blasted in the media for reciting a poem. That poem contained this excerpt. I stress on that word ì Excerpt ì!!!   ì Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed  Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers  To stay home that day ì   Half of those white politicians grew a third testicle and almost died. They insisted on baraka resigning and he gave them the most emphatic finger in existence. If he would have gave them a good ol fashioned ì Fuck you ì life would have been perfect. So Amari Baraka walks in as Poet Laureate with Balls that clank and he stirs the waters. My question: ì Wasnít they already aware that he was known for some fiery provocative material back in the 60ís? ì Did they expect him to be verbally shackled in what e believes in ? Were his words and literature suppose to be compromised because of his position ?  You know what, he has every right to say what he wants to say. There is this small piece of parchment that the government has adopted and there is a certain section called ì freedom of speechî.   So with the double edge sword coming back at us after we swing it, are we ready to defend our stance after we speak for what we feel is our ì Government given rightî?  Just give it some thought.    Amariís Website:  urlLink Amari Baraka  Amari's Poem: urlLink Somebody blew up America   Take Care  Peace, Love,   Fish  >)))">

       FUNNY as HELL   I am kinda pissed because I posted something and some bullshit happened. So, I just got this joke and I thought it was funny. Speak to you in the morning  Peace  Particular Merit  Good life?    A man appears before St. Peter at the pearly gates. "Have you ever done anything of particular merit?" St. Peter asks.  "Well, I can think of one thing," the man offers. "Once, on a trip to the Black Hills, out in South Dakota, I came upon a gang of high-testosterone bikers who were threatening a young woman. I directed them to leave her alone, but they wouldn't listen. So I approached the largest and most heavily tattooed biker. I smacked him on the head, kicked his bike over, ripped out his nose ring and threw it on the ground, and told him, 'Leave her alone now or you'll answer to me.'"  St. Peter was impressed. "When did this happen?"  "Just a couple minutes ago."

       ok......... uh......I am creatively shot   THis morning was my first quest into writing the notes for the Monday series. I thought it was going to be easier!!! I just figured that I will be my normal self and just write about the evening before. Shit I WAS SOOOOOOO WRONG. I caught myself saying " oh oh, I can't call the crowd motherfuckers" delete. " Damn, I can say it was a " Fucking awesome " time last night ", edit.   I was stuck in protocol and politically correct heaven. It sucked royal ass!!!!!!!!!! I guess that my flare and knack for writing comes at a price  of " not being shackled " by societal sensitivity.  So, Let me explain something to you people that have been wondering about me. I have a great tendency of hiding what I really feel and even though I am Mister happy go lucky, I could be melting on the inside. So if you read this blog and you think " Oh, he is in a good mood, let me call him and bother him " You might be wrong.  Let me keep things in general for the purpose of entertainment.  Last night was LouderJAM at 13. Oh man, can I tell you that everything rocked. The open Mic was incredibly heavy. 22 people were squeezed in that bitch. Don't ask me how the hell we went through 22 people. I went up there and did a collabo of my BRONX piece and I got really good feedback from people. I , for some reason wasn't feeling it.  Some mics weren't working and the important parts were not heard. The audience was lost. I tried to do it as loud and strong as possible but also to keep a good anunciation thing going on. It rocked good though. Ray was loving it and he was happy with it. The feature said that my piece was his favorite of the night...... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...............fuck it, I'm happy.  Taylor came in last night and kidnapped Lynne Procope and deemed her Inappropiate. He was kinda p-noid hoping that I won't come out of no where and pummel on him. Why do people think that I am such a bad ass????? I am a nice guy. I haven't thrown nobody down a flight of stiars in a long while. I Am A NICE FUCKING GUY DAMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok, went home last night and just festered in my living room. Started writing and I couldn't stop. Relationships was the topic at hand and I just couldn't help writing.   All I can say.........  " I'm Sorry "   Gonna meet up with some people for some  Poetry talk today over a cup of coffee. I feel like one of the friends cast.  This Thursday is the DARK future SLAM!!!!!!!!!!!  DEPENDENCE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL   I can't wait.   peace, Love  take care  Fish  >)))">

       Two things.......   My urine debacle Rich is king for a night  First, I go see the Parole Peeps yesterday and I am beaming a smile across my face because I know I just have two more visits left and I am gone. So, the bitch that I see is ( excuse me to all my feminist peeps ) tries to hit me with, " We need to put you through a random drug test ". This is bullshit because my case dealt with a gun and not drugs. So, I gleefully sign my agreement and I go to the back to pee in my cup. Does my P.O have to go with me??? Nope. The old hag, whore, desititute crackhead bitch just want to push my buttons and truly tries to get a rise out of me. The wheels start turning, the mind starts clicking, the smoke protrudes from the ears..... AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! I know. I grab the cup, I start peeing. I start doing my usual " Hum as I pee " thing. I proceed to fill the cup to the very very brim with urine. I put it on her desk and she asks me " What is that? I say " It's the urine that you asked for. Did you have to fill it that much? Well, I had to go really bad. She asks me to remove some and I tell her no. She wanted urine, " Go ahead, knock yourself out ". She then puts in the " Parole Stick ". This is a stick that says if you have dirty urine ( Contaminated with drugs or whatever ). I stay in the room to make sure she doesn't do a switch on me ( I heard stories that they have switched urine). The stick doesn't change after two minutes, I am good to go.  So never drinking or doing a drug in my life is aying off  people. The funniest part was when I told her,  " Don't waste a drop of that, I am super clean ". She was not happy. So another day of having my day brought up to another ante. I  love my life.  Second..... Brother Rich has won the Friday Nuyo slam. I wanted to go last night but due to forces beyond my control, I couldn't make it. He shot me an e-mail at 5am saying that he won. I knew he would do it. I am proud of that cat. He has this control of the language that stands him out. This year, he is making a team somewhere.  So Rich won the NUYO and my full to the brim cup of urine was clean. I am happy.  Peace  Love  Porkchops

       2 more visits......   ....... That is all I need. After today, I just need two more visits to my Parole officer and I am an official free man. Yea, I admit it to all of those that think I am a goodie two shoe poet. I have been on parole for the last five years paying for a crime I did commit. I am not screaming  " Not guilty ". I did it ( copped a plea ) and I paid with plenty. So, after October 7th, I am going to have an " I AM FREE " blog posted that very same day. Most of my peeps ( Criminals ) say that as soon as I finish parole that I will probably get in trouble. Uh, no way in fucking hell that is going to happen.  I am just going to keep writing, reading, and absorbing the incredible talent I have surrounded myself with.  It is best for me to say that I had both feet submerged in the gutter. With both feet wet, I shuffled into poetry and just wrote about what has been going on in my life. It's a beautiful thing.   Here is a thought. I have a criminal record and I want to teach. Would it be possible??? It is going to be hard as hell but I will be able to do something. I might not be able to teach for the Board of Education but I can outsource my services. I am teaching at Rikers again on September 19th for 16 weeks. I am taking a teacher training program to become a teaching artist. Life is getting really interesting. Shit, I am going to be in charge of two interns during the rikers Foray. That should be fun. Having two individuals that probably never even walked passed a jail.  Oh well, time to go and do my thing.   I am ok people, just kinda enjoying this alone time  Peace, Love, Off to see the Parole man  Porkchops

       I.........   Despise arrogance Loathe Blatant stereotypical assumptions HATe Bias motherfuckers. Let them be white, Black, latino. They are a proverbial poision to our society.  I am not in a good mood. My day started off with the possiblity of doing something that many people have never done. A friend of mines is contemplating, considering, thinking about retirement, he is 28. Don't ask beyond that. His days of renting from apartment to apartment is far behind him. So, he taps me and ask " Fish, can you do some research and check to see what is an off the hook boat ?". I oblige, I research. I learn the different types of boats and what his budget will allow. So I start picking a crusier type of boat ( Doral to be exact ). Give a take 30 feet. 30 - 40 gallons in take. Used, it can be about 60 g's. Had that and much more to spare. Get to Conneticut...... Got to CT yacht Sales, Nothing but shit!!!! Fuck the internet. Fucking dingy's and garbage boats from 89 and prior. I was heated. Then my man starts talking shit, I am about to throw him a quick stab to the neck. We start dreiving around CT looking for other options and headed into some different dealers. These people looked at us like we had three heads protruding from our ass.  Did you people know that cash isn't worth shit unless a bank says it is worth something. In other words, these motherfuckers refuse to sell out right!!!  We saw an awesome " eliminator " crusier for 80. I am thinking this is it, this white dude starts talking about financing and loans. I am trying to tell him it is outright. he says, let me crunch some numbers. He says it will come out to 134 g's. Motherfucker, it is 80 straight, give it up. Thing is, the bank won't get the money. Somebody would get shut out if it is brought out straight. That is the only thing that I would figure. I was heated.  Even with money to spend, they still gave a hassle. Why the fuck is that ???  My day was shot to shit. We can buy trucks and cars straight, not boats. That is the conclusion. On the upside, We ate in two incredibly awesome places with seafood that made my mouth water. Seafood for breakfast and Lunch and we were too pissed for dinner.    Best part of day.... Lobster for Lunch Worst part....... realizing that we still have a long way to go before we are somebody worth taking serious.  That is ok, we got two more dealers to check out and our game plan is different. More details later.  I'm out

       best thing...............   When you are moved. When you feel something deep down inside that wants to make you move or change the world. last night after I got home, Iwas just in awe of what I just experienced. You just want to grab a pen and write down every feeling that you have. Then, turn it into poetry, and make the world read it, hear, eat it, cherish it, accept it. You know, I have been writing poetry for a LONGGGG time. I just got onto this scene about 2 years ago bootleg and 1 year official this coming November.  The times that I have had under the umbrella of Poetry is really amazing me. I write in this blog and I am not going to keep it 100% poetry because my life doesn't flow that way. I still know that is is a huge part in my life and it has quickly become one of my favorite parts. I have always had a huge complex that I will never be good enough to hold it down in this field. That I will never be good enough to be one of those " awesome " writers. I never had any dreams of books, chapbooks, nationals. I just wanted to write a good poem, read it on the mic, and maintain that happiness.  Being involved in the administrative aspects of poetry is hard. I want to write all the time and get better at what I do. I want to read and learn everything there is to know about Poetry, Life, and believe it or not, my history. What made me this way is huge to what I write. I am a Strong Puerto Rican man. What has made me strong?? My grandparents that fought to get their land. In my father seeing that struggle, he has always told me to fight. I fight for what is righteous. I fight for what I deserve. I deserve knowledge to make me a better human being. I want to sit down on a stoop with some young kids and tell them about the History that I have learned. I am not a " part " of history.  Waht happens in my time period doesn't make me, I will always feel what happens before my time is what made me stronger. Maybe others will get stronger by seeing what has given me this drive to learn, write, focus, and maybe even love. Life is good to me right now. Seven fingers on a keyboard, two fingers around a pen, a mind soaking up life, my heart growing everyday.   For all you suckers out there, thanks   Peace, Love, Pork Chops  Fish

       how??? How can I even start......   ......... there is no correct way to even describe how I feel. I am tired but I have to get this feeling down before a good night's sleep erases the hurricane of emotions running uncontrolled through gated veins. Tonight was Acentos and our Feature of " Louis Reyes Rivera ".  I don't care about the flow of the night, the people, nor the hosting. I just want to convey this and this only. Louis reyes Rivera brought everyone at Acentos to their feet. He got the first and only standing ovation at Acentos. He trekked us through history, culture, personal experiences, tribulations, all under the umbrella of Poetry. Just hearing his genuine words of experience and craft has left me in awe. Speechless and dumbfounded I stood there seeing such an awesome array of words, format, delivery, content, context. Then, after his set, we stood outside as he mesmerized us with tidbits of knowledge. Books that we should read, things that we should know. Until the day that I see " Jimmy Santiago Baca " perform in front of me, Mr Rivera has garnered my full fledged support and admiration.   Another day of awesome Poetry. Another sucessful Acentos. I am content. I am happy. I am the luckiest motherfucker on this face of the planet.  Life is good,   Fish

       Greatness comes from family.........   ......... I say this because last night was that commonality amongst poets that gave us that fervent feeling of family. Jayme, Jai, and Rich took the uppercase and made it special. It was the best thing that I saw in a long time. I think all three of them explored new work and mixed in old work. All three sets were perfect. I am proud to call these three friends, supporters, and poets. Featured Poets at that!!!!    This will be a great week concerning " the word ". Tonight is Acentos I am really looking forward to it. Soemthing about Louis Reyes Rivera that is making me all antsy. It kinda feels like I am seeing a legend perform tonight.  Also, this is something that Oscar and I put together and we are doing nothing but great things. Thanks to the hard work that is being put in, life is good to Acentos.  Last night after leaving the Bar 13 after my first hosting jaunt, I felt kinda funny. I am trekking this walk that I never knew would be possible. I walked into 13 two years ago and see this dude hosting and I get up there and I read this small piece. I get off and he asked me if it was my first time. He showed me this love that was integrel in me becoming a " poet ". Then, last night, I got to introduce him. It felt like full circle and I wanted to give this spiel. Yet, being the responsible " host " that I tried to be, I just introduced and kept on walking. I always say, if the host was an asshole, I would have never gone back. Introducing him last night was easily one of the best feelings of the evening. " Thanks for being real nigga"  Sidenote: Serious drama on Hot 97 right now. They actually just had a fight on the air.  Back to business.......  Went to eat last night and had a good burger. It wasn'y the same as our usual water hole but it was ok. Had a good conversation with Marty and Guy. Spoke some business with Roger and I want to get things out of the way. I am not trying to put things off until I am swamped. Life is good and I need to keep it that way.  Had a more " getting to know you " talk with MC Siegal.  Another partaker in the blog madness. It feels weird when you meet people you barely know and they are reading your blog. I guess I should appreciate it more then anything else.    Well, Tomorrow would be an Acentos update. After that........ I am taking Thursday and Friday off and who knows where my feet will take me.     I had a great time yesterday and I really have to thank all of you for making it special. If it wasn't for ya, it would have been shit.  Note: leave you e-mail and comments in the guestbook.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

       Coming down from my high.......    Yes people, I have reached another high in Poetic hijinks. A nice sucessful evening of hosting the Bar 13 stage for the uppercase feature. I felt really good about everything and kept a good flow to the evening. I just kept things steady and as usual, the place did it's own job. I got my " good works " from several people and I was happy. So, in slaying this savage beast, not too many jobs will seem too hard.   Let me get to bed.  Peace

       Why sooo early?......   ........... cable companies all suck royal eggs. I tell you that someone, somewhere in a galaxy really not that far away has the mental apititude of a newt. They always give the best movies at the worst fucking times. Since I don't sleep, it doesn't bother me, yet, how about all the people that fall asleep early and never have the opportunity to see great flicks. This morning, I woke up about 5am and I was all pissy that I woke up that early. It is too early to watch porn, ok, I saw that movie already!!! sO i START FLICKING. Not me, the remote. Sure enough, they were giving the  urlLink The Sandlot !! I loved this movie. It was a cute movie about some young kids playing baseball and they fall into some mischief trying to get a baseball back from a backyard with the biggest dog in the west coast. It was a funny movie. It was a cute movie. It was one of those guilty pleasure flicks that we won't admite we like but deep down inside, we love e,. Kinda like women and porn. They won't admit they watch them, but they have about 5 under the bed.  With that being said " LEnny , CAN I HAVE MY MOVIES BACK?".   So, I had a great weekend. Good quiet Sunday of nothing but just cable and relaxation. I needed one of those, leave me alone days. It always feels good to just be left alone ( Downtime ).    Tonight is my first offical foray into the hosting ring of Bar 13. IT is the Uppercase of Rich, Jai, and Jayme. I am so happy for them. All three are awesome poets and I can't think of anyone else that deserves it more then these three. I am hosting to make sure that this night remains their night. I always had that small resentment that my night was killed. No reason will be given but I always felt that it wasn't " just " for the uppercase. It is all thrown to the wind. I am happy for them and I am seeing them growing and doing their thing.   So, I hope all its well,   Peace, Love, Porkcops.  Fish

       Just 40 miles............   I think the best thing in the world is when you decide to go somewhere you never have been to. Something different, something new. After coming off like a bandit and not paying for the repair of my phone, the gas peddle and me bonded and I caught my feet trekking around Bear Mountain. The ast time I was there, I was about 3 years old. I really can't remember much from that far back so I tried to soak up enough of everything when I was there. The lake was pretty nice and I had a good time just looking at the people enjoying themselves. They rent these boats and non-nautical folks get on them and make fools of themselves. A nice walk around the lake and back into the hooptie. When I was leaving, there was a scenic view route that I wanted to explore. Drove up the road and it took us to the top of the mountain. This view from up there was incredible. Incredible for the fact that something so beautiful can be so close to NYC. I could see NYC from the top of the mountain and it made me think that no matter how big NYC is, it is really so small compared to this. The writer in me almost took over and I started thinking about all the gorgeous nuances from that view. The hills falling into each other. The shades of green's pitching a battle to over come each other.The sky laying on top of the mountain as a beautiful woman caressing a silk bed. It was just mind blowing. Spontaneous moments in life prove to be the best for me.  Just get up and go and wonder where you will be in a few hours drive.   I ate some shrimp yesterday and it was ok. The restaurant was pretty decent ( the suggestion from Tom himself ). I had a Shrimp Fra diavalo, Lenny had  a Shell steak on a seasoned steak. It had seasoning up the wazoo but it was ok. Funny thing, when I was taking Lenny home and as soon as I got to drop her off, I had to use the bathroom. You know that Fish has the weakest buttcheeks in NYC. When I have to use the bathroom, I have to GO!!!!!! I ate 4 lights and barely made it home.  I need more fiber in my diet.  Ok, time to bounce  Porkchops

       More Dreams............   Good Morning people. I am here giving you a Saturday Morning entry. My day today entails me going to an At&T store to get my fuckin phone fixed. Of corse, me fiddling with the phone, I screwed it up. I should have just left it alone. So, now I need $25 dollars for a new SIM card. Life is biting.   So, hopefully after I get it fixed, I could have a constructive day. I need some relaxation and get away time. That trip from Chicago has really given me this itch to start taking vacation. So I am thinking that if everything stay steady with no drama, I could take one. My man Wil went to the Dominican republic to an all inclusive resort with even flight included for $700. Sounds good to me. I need to start living my life again. I got some serious stuff going on from Septemeber on until April. Alot of work and organizing. After that, I am doing my own thing. Shit, I might even take a sabbatical like one of my boys in the Louder Organization is thinking about doing. All this better give me points into heaven.  " God, I know I have been a bad motherfucker, I hope that you can give a brotha some slack. Tell Peter that when I get there, I worked hard to do my things righteous "  Peace, Love, Porkchops   Fish

       Why does the brain work when we are sleeping???   Seriously, what's the purpose of having dreams?? Why even bother working when you are supposed to be resting?? I have these retarded dreams that leave me in cold sweats. Then, you wake up all sweaty and nasty and then get pissed because it's a dream.   Last night, I was dreaming that I was in my parents house sleeping over. Two people decided to break in and I had my way with them. My dad wakes up and see's me getting rid of evidence. Instead of his usual beefing, he helps me and mentions great ways to get rid of it. Now, you know this is bullshit because my Dad is such a straight arrow that he never even had a drink in public. Don't ask me where this bad streak in me derived from. Back to the dream, the cops for some reason started knocking on the door ( the arrogant, hard, " let us in " type of knock " ). I proceed to jump out the window with one of the bodies and decide to tie the remains to a van that was traveling down the highway.  Seriously, where did all this come from?? I got home last night and I was in bed sleeping like a baby at 9:30pm. No horror movies, killings, shootings, news, sex, porno, nothing. I wake up relieved but pissed that this was even in my head. I need to really seek therapy or something.  So, what is planned this weekend?? Nothing big really. Maybe part two of Eric's Bachelor party. The guys from his job are going to take him  out and he has invited me. Shit, I don't mind. It can't be worse then what we did. We are sooooo going to hell after that party.  I am just relaxing and doing some work on the Rikers Freshstart program that will be starting again. I have to talk to Roger to get a syllabus ( lesson Plan for the 18 weeks ). This way, whomever wants to teach certain things, they can just look at the plan and attend.  More planning, more work, just enough reward. Life is good.   Time to bounce.......  Peace, Love  Porkchops  Fish

       Read, read, read............   The first thing I did when I was inducted into the LOuderARTS project was go through every single archive entry. I was searching for any genuine comments on me as a poet, performer, and person. The one thing that I read and till this day, changed my life  as a poet, ............ " Fish has sooo much potential, if he picks up every poetry book and just reads as much as possible ". Wow, I took that and started reading, reading and reading. At first, I hated it because I was reading books that were not interesting in the least. Then, Baca came into play. Diaz, Taylor, chapbooks. Then , I realized that poetry books come in all shapes, forms and sizes. I started reading poetry and Bio's of the Latino ( primarily Boriquas ) on the internet. I never realized that there is such a long line of Puerto Rican poets throughout our history.   I think it is a good thing that things were said in reference to me. It made me a better man.   Ok, time to go, I spent most of my morning reading blogs and some were really long today.  urlLink Oscar's  blog is pretty good today. He finally got to update it and it is worth your time. Also,  urlLink Rich  updated his blog from Florida. He is uppercasing next week and it is going to be crazy. I can't wait..   Time to bounce.   Take care  Peace, Porkcops  Fish  >)))">

It is just weird the way it all gets broken down. Anyway. not the point.  I am tired today, does this surpise you??? I was the first one wanting to get home early and still got home late. Food talking and this awesome card game taht we started playing last night. It made it for one of those interesting evenings.  I didn't have much time to write today. I was rather shitted on with work today. So my day is busy......  time to go   Peace, Love, Pork Chops  Fishdawg

       I know, I know...........   .......... I should be in bed. I will be the first one complaining tomorrow that I am tired but, I have to enter this blog because I will forget how I feel If I don't.  Well, I was home flicking through some channes and I came across channel 10 giving some interesting stuff. The topic of the old documentary was " abortion ". Ah yes, I will take a chance and write about this topic and have some friends maybe even disown me. Aren't I entitled to my opinion???   Anyway, when I flicked on the channel, thye were showing the in's and out's of abortion. How forcips are used to crush the skull of the fetus. How the white brain matter gushes out when the skull is crushed. depending on the term length of the preganancy, then everything is scraped out (remains ) from the uterus. If the term is very far along, pieces of arms, legs and whatever else that is left is then taken out.   Some doctors were interviewed and they mainly were scarred by years of " 35 a day Abortions " that they performed. This one doctor said that he performed over 10, 000 abortions. First thing going through my mind is , that is some shit.  Technically, not even some wars have our best soldiers killed over 10, 000 people. Now, here is what I think...........  Some babies are born premature at 5 months and with neo natal care, they survive with a pretty high success rate. So, anything after 5 months, let's just say is null and void. So an abortion before 5 months is still murder of a life?? Well, I think so.  I am going to go out on a limb and say that as soon as pregnancy kicks in and you decide to have an abortion, you are taking a life.  Fucked up as it sounds, I understand in some situations, it is warranted.  Still , it is a hard and maybe the hardest thing a person has to go through. Would I ever condone or even go through it with another, unfortunately, I say yes. I say it's murder and wrong but things have to be done. Right now, my significant other is har core against it. This is why all steps are being taken to ensure that accidental preganancy does not happen. I am at a crossroad at my life and kids at this time, major no no.   I know alot of people that have gne thrugh it and I have been there 100% of the way. Shit, I even have helped out some people with it financially. Soes this make me a bad person??? I have contributed to a process which in turn will remove a human life from existing. Well, you know what people??? Buying that one drink for the road, that bag of weed, a steak for that morbidly obesed freind of yours is all contributing to someone's death. Let it be instant or over time. We are all guilty of it at some time.  Abortions are one of the many necessary evils that are here and like it or not, I don't see an end to them in my lifetime. If society was better informed about contraceptives and other methods ( not fucking ) , abortions wouldn't be that much of an issue.  who is the perfect candidate for an abortion ? Well, what do you think ??? If my girl gets pregant and I was scared to have a child, is it right to get one? maybe not.........  If my girl was gang raped by 4 strangers and she got pregant, would it be right then??? Let 's get technical, she would most likely be in the hospital and she would get the RU-486 ( morning after pills ) and he wouldn't get pregnant. Yet, would it be right. Should I or her be subjected to a lifetime of memories from a horrible moment in life by raising this child. I know I know, it is a child and love will cure all. well, bullshit,  you will remember , like it or not, that you were raped and thrown into an emotional blender everytime you look at this child.   I do know, that it is the women's choice and she will do whatever she wants to do. I would lean towards having one if things were to go down that route now. That is just me. Then again, that clock is ticking and I need to make moms a granny. She is harassing me. So it all just depends people  I don't know.......  Well, I am going to work  Take care   Peace, Love, porkchops

       BBQ and grass skirts   What do you get when a crazy man has access to a grass skirt and Hip hop?? Simple, a crazy man danicng hip hop in a grass skirt. So, the suprise Bridal Luao for my dawg Eric and his wife to be was awesome.  Plenty of food, plenty of drink, plenty god vibes. I had an awesome time.  We got there early and my skills on the BBQ was put into effect quick. I got the food ready and had to escape at two o'clock for a feature at Mindbuilders which was pretty cool. I truly got there and featured and ran but I had to do some serious bonding time with my dawg Eric.  This is going to be a hard week. Be well folks  Gotta run  Peace  Porkchops

       Blah blah blah   LOL  This is the morning consensus of my ritualistic awakening. I slept pretty good yesterday considering that I went to bed at 2am. I woke up around 8am and now I have to go get some things ready for a BBQ. I took care of everything last night that I need for today and once again, I leave no stone unturned. Sometimes I suprise myself at how prepared I get for shit.   I got some big things coming up in Nov and next spring.Let's just say taht next spring, my name will definitely be very well known throughout the poetry community.  When you do one thing and run with it, people gain faith in you. No one expects any less.   Time for me to go BBQ  Hasta Pasta Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Can you see??   If not, You better get a flashlight.  If you are reading this, you have lived through the " Black out of 2003 ". Yes folks, another blackout to stricken NYC and plunge it into darkness. LOL  I got home yesterday and believe it or not, it wasn't that bad. Sleeping sucked but, all was well. I stood around outside my apartment just chillin in the cool evening breeze. I had my trusty maglight and that thing is the BOMB!!! I was trly shining light into people apartment at any given minute. They weren't upset, they needed light.  What was the best part of this blackout??? When I was outside, I was looking up at my apartment and I glanced up into the sky. Oh man, the stars were incredible. Thousands of stars in the sky that were not drowned out by the lights of NYC. I always liked lookng up at stars. Gives you that peaceful blanket of....... " everything is alright ". I didn't have a computer, e-mail, phone, lights, or even food in my fridge. I did have a candle and " healing Earthquakes " by Jimmy Santiago Baca. It gave me a whole new appreciation for the great poet that he is.   Well, I hope that all the masses are ok. You all be well.  I am off.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Fighting my own demons.......   Yea yea yea....... I know it sounds like an old metaphor but it is true in my case. Forgive me for being kinda sensitive, I just have some things in my mind that I need to either erase or accept.  Right now, I am not leaning towards either direction.  Last night was a great night, I didn't do anything at all. No poetry, No reading, no writing. I was just in my house enjoying the fact that nothing was on my agenda. This was a great thing.   I was watching the news last night and a story broke that Amari's Baraka's ( Desposed Poet Laureate of NJ ) daughter was found murdered.  I don't know why this bother me. A couple of weeks ago, Yousef Kommonyaka's ( Forgive spelling ) wife killed her child and committed suicide. It makes me wonder why are these bad things happening to these poets.  I have been around death for a long time. My best friend was shot 6 times with a 45 back in 1991 and from there on end, it all steamed rolled. One after the other, friends that I grew up with were dying. Then, the unthinkable, I became numb to death. I became so unsensitive at hearing that someone was killed that it bothers people around me. Understand, From the top of my head.........  Freddy ( killed ) Steve ( killed ) White Boy ( killed ) Kevin ( killed ) Harry ( suicide) Pupi ( killed ) George ( killed ) Louie ( killed ) Charlie ( killed ) Nelson ( killed ) Angel ( killed ) Orlando ( killed ) Tony ( suicide ) Mark ( suicide ) Boogie ( killed ) Shane(  killed ) Tico ( killed ) Jerome ( suicide ) Jose ( killed ) Nelson ( killed )  This was off the top of my head and still, there are the people of aquaintance that are no longer with us.  I don't know. Death has always been a weird thing for me. I have tried to accept it but now, I always feel that small bout of sadness within me. I have always felt like a loser, so my life could have ended and I wouldn't have cared. Then, I find poetry. I guess taht I have something worthy to look forward to.  All these people that have and will die are somebody with a niche in life. They left behind friends, family, lovers, parents. Then the mourning starts and the battle cries of tears will steadily stream through reddened cheeks.  I really don't want people to mourn when I die. My best friend Eric says that I know tooo many people to have a regular funeral. I guess he will figure that out when I die then. Since I am dead, not much for me to do but lay there.  Ok... " When I die, don't mourn me guys. Talk and laugh and remember everything about life.  Remember that I tried my best to keep everything righteous.  Remember how everytime I walk with you all down the street that I was overtly the protector in the crowd. I would fight to the end to protect my friends that I loved.   Remember that I worked 100% at everything that came my way. From Poetry, to friendships, to love, I am giving it 100%.  Remember my love of life, my love of honesty, loyalty.  Remember what made me laugh.  Remember my favorite poem.  Remember me when I told you when I was alive, I will always be with you. If you read this, I have touched you. I don't have to be dead to say that you are a part of my life and that I cherish you. I tell you when I am happy and healthy and I am not afraid to say that you are family.  So Eric...... " a two day wake and spread my ashes in the Bronx and Puerto Rico. Outside Acentos, Outside 13, and spread me in Cabo Rojo Puerto Rico. Right over the cliff at " El Faro "  :)  It is all love  Peace  Porkchops

       Rest and normalcy  Is normalcy even a word. I always catch myself doing a Dubya Bush and making up words. You don't even know if they exist but you sure as hell use them.   I caught muself reading the blogs of most of the poets that attended Nationals and it is quickly proving that everyone is veering in different directions.  Everyone had a great time but some  " hate"  on poetry is coming out as we speak. I always wondered who gives anyone the right to call other people's work  " Wretched ". Does this mean that you consider your work better then theirs??? What if someone calls your work " incredibly profound " at one minute and then it is called  " wretched "  the next? Where would you stand ? I have always had this aweful disdain for people that will depricate other people's work. This makes me feel as if they feel  their work is know all, best all of poetry. Don't get me wrong, some people have great poetry but I still don't find them in the right to call anybody's else's work  " Wretched " . Let's call this note.... I am a big dude with several hard fought street fights  under my belt. Would I go around telling other people that their street style of fighting sucks because I am better at it??? Nope. If you like to kick, go for it, If you like to wrestle, go for it. If you are a street punching freestyler, go for it. I won't demean your style because that is what works for you. IF I don't like it, even though I might feel I am better at MY style of fighting, I will not belittle yours. I remember several months back, I got fed up at someone talking shit about others people poetry. I have always said, there is a difference between critical analysis of poetry and down right Diva hating. I could take an honest critical edit of my poem and use it to better me as a writer. Just remember, I am writing for me to better me. I am not taking a critique to edit a poem to sound like you.  Last night at 13 was cool. It was mello as fuck because we were all dead and had no energy. The open mic was the usual mix of old and new with even me reading a poem.    The slam was even better because my newly minted poetic brethren of Rich has won his first slam.  I am extremely proud of him.  I knew that he was going to win.  I told him the day before that no one can even remotely come close to him. Even though Mahogany brown slammed, I knew that Rich had enough substance and content to take her out. He kept it genuine and real. I remember when Oscar slammed at the Nuyo and Mahogany Killed everyone that night. So Rich did his thing and I am happy. I almost came close to slamming but I can't do it right now. Just because someone is needed, I am not getting thrown into the mix. When I slam it will be because I will do it at 100% and at my call. Lynne called it best " Fish baby, don't ever slam if you don't want to ". So, Rich has his first win and it is all good. He gets three point towards the semi finals and he will do his thing as only " he " wants to. Write to write and you do you.  Time for me to go. I have to post some upcoming events with Manny Xavier, Lynne Procope, and The Culture Bandit herself.  Peace, Love, Pork chops  Fish

       Get loud, Be strong   Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.................... I am back in the sanity of my office just writing to my hearts content. I have updated but not to the point where I have felt that it was quality. I am sorry for that guys. I was just star struck by soooo much at nats.  The ride yesterday was incredible and I feel that me and  my roadtrip brethren got just " a little bit closer ". No drama, No hate, no gossip, just good conversation and reflection on a purely genuine experience.  I have a new respect for all of them. Thank you  I figured that there is sooooooooooo much more to poetry then one has thought. Even after all the great poets I have heard, there is still more. A piece of me sees too much " I have been Oppresed" poetry. So to be different, I stay away from that. I always have felt that my " coming into my own " has been my own distinctive voice and style. IT is me and all me that makes me.  I feel great and I am looking forward to what is in store for me, and also and my Louder Family.  Gotta run,   Peace, Love, Pork chops  Fish

You all truly are something special.  Take care folks  I am good.

       We are still true champions   Today were the finals at the Navey pier. Of course, I was rooting for the Nuyorican with every ounce of support that I could give them. It was a strong bout pitting the nuyo against L.A, Austin, Oakland. The poetry was pretty solid ( performance wise ) throughout. The last piece ( group ) that came out of L.A was crazy as fuck. I can't fault anybody today.  The Nuyo gave it hard and I am proud to say that " Them is my niggas ". Julian Curry, Carlos Gomez, Jive Poetic, Hostage, all are certainly lucky to have carried the NYC name to a finals bout. They took that name and made sure that they were cemented in the bout.   Felice Belle, Karen Jamie, Anacaona ( who will feature for us on Tuesday @Acentos ) and every one of the entourage with them, it was a pleasure.    I look forward to the next steps and endeavors in seeing these poets grow as individuals and grow as writers. Write to write. Write for you. Write from you. The points are not the point, the point is the Poetry. Oh wait, that is taken!! Ok ok ok...... Point is, we are all writers and we are all family through word. My door will always be open.  I am off to pack  NYC is calling me!!! I need a real chinese food place fuckin bad!  Peace

       Should this be my time to sum it up???   Well, I am back in my room and should I even start to sum my nationals experience up? Nahhhh....... simple enough people, it is not the end. I think I have finally found my new begininng. The experience at nationals and all the people I have met has given me more then what I would have thought. I have seen poets that have blown my world. I have seen poets that as humble as can be. I have nothing bad to say about this trip. I do have stories about bullshit that I have seen. I still have nothing bad to say. I am taking to NY stories and memories that will give me solid poetry for the next 12 months.  Tomorrow is finals and the Nuyo has made it and I will support a fellow NYC venue without question. We will be there with voiceboxes prepared and hands warmed!!!

       this alone was worth it....   I can't tell you the energy and emotions that were running through the Filter ( bar ). Lat night was Vancouver, Hollywood, vs Nuyorican. Holy shit " went through my mind several times over. Hollywood went up and dropped the opening group piece to the tune of a 29.8. I can't tell you how it was going to go after that. THe energy took off and it was crazy after that. In the standing room only crowd, we lucked out and got some seats ( Oscar's is a fuckin genius ) and we were right in the middle of the room. Nuyo went up and they fucking killed it. Carlos killed it. Julian killed it, Jive poetic killed it!!!!!!! Jive ( perfect 10's across ), Julian ( perfect 10's ). Just to see this element get taking up to another level, it has given me something that I can't put on this blog. Eventually, I might find the proper words. As of now, I am still overwhelmed.  I was speaking to Roger and I got kinda sensitive yesterday Not only has everyone of these people are proving to be great friends, I am learning soo much from them. Roger slammed with a poem that he just wrote two weeks ago and did incredible. Lynne made soooo many people cry yesterday when she did her poem. Literally, women were crying in the audience. That is Poetry. That is the power of words.!!!  THis experience out here is proving to be the best decision I have ever made in my life. Tonight are the semi-finals. So much poetry and not even close to an overload.  Oh, and tonight I am actually reading. YEAH BABY!!!!!!!!!!  Peace

       Finally, some time   7am and I finally got some time. Last night, I was running on empty. 9:45pm and I had no energy. With no energy, this ran in tandom with very low tolerance. I wasn't going to stick around being tired. So, my good bye's were said and I was back in my room at 10pm. I had some food and hit that bed like a little baby.   So, before my nappy nappy time. I was headed out to catch some of the bouts. Funny was me walking to the chopin theater and then walking down milwalkee ave to the other venues. Now, here is the funny part, The walk was about 45 mins to an hour. I thought it was close and that shit was way too far. Thing is, when I was coming back, the short cut , cut out about 35 mins from my trip. so, life is good that my room is this close to all the venues.   Last night, I got to see Providence win their first prelim bout. St Louis also took their first prelim. After that, I know nothing.   Today, I am trying to catch the cover slam and some of the other goodies they have going on.  Let me bounce  Too much to do and my day barely started.  PEace

       ROAD TRIP Antics!!!   So much to write and no time at all.   The road trip setled well, 13 hours with three stops and we made it to Chi-town.  First rest stop:   Edward wants to scare us but put his face against the wrong vehicle. Seve lost his sammich and stripped searched everyone Cassey Angley wants her medicine and goes into the wrong car. I pointed her to a different car again and she tries to search it.  Opening cermonies were ridiculous. All walks of life in different shapes and sizes. The team seems happy and in good spirits.  8pm and I have been up for 36 ours straight after my 10 hour trek to this place that looks exactly like New York.   Saw Marc Smith up close, he is old. Saw Bowerbird, he is fat.  Gotta run, I need sleep

       Rocky is still alive    I have to make this quick.  Last night, we all headed to the local diner bar that we all always eat at. I was shocked to see what Maria did last night. We walk in and the waitress ask us all what we would like to drink. She was very sweet and extremely cordial. Maria Asked for a Diet Coke and the waitress politely say that there is none available, Maria gets up and says " What " ????????. I want my diet coke, the poor defenseless waitress was scared and tried to walk away but Maria grabbed a book of Rich's Poems and swings it wildly and gives the poor little defenseless waitress a black eye.  Then, Maria stand over  the pron body of the waitress and says, " You go to the store accross the street and get me my Diet Coke Bitch ". The waitress gets up and runs into the bathroom crying. She brought Maria a Diet Coke from the ladies Bathroom and Maria drank it. I never knew they had soda fountains in Bathrooms. Ewwwwwww  LOL  Just joking.  Maria did give a waitress a black eye though. LOL  Peace   I am off to Chi-town!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Peace, Love, fuck the bulls!!!

       I have NOThinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng..........   LOL... or................. SEXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...........  Ok ok ok, yesterday was the LouderJAM portion of of Synonymus ( or anonymous as the studio wrote it ). A good group of straggelers made it to the studio in tow with instruments, poems, vocals and exposed boobs. Ooops, did I say that ? Sorry. Just something about an exposed cleavege just makes me drool. Anyway, Ray " the sensitive one" Daniel Medina tugged, towed, carried, dragged, all the equipment from the comforts of home to make this thing work. Sure enough, another evening of top notch improv collaborations. This time, the studio even had horns to blow. Scott blowing his melodic creating breathe into a pantie dropping saxophone. Obona impressing my most pessimistic and unimpressible hater with skills on a trombone. A trombone people!!!!! She pulled out a trombone ad rocked out Vaudeville style. Several moments made for great poetry, others made for great music. My moment went for people half assing it through and my piece proved stronger then the music. That kinda sucked royal ass. Yet, I still had a great time.  Did I mention that I am staying home today ???? Yes, I said fuck work and I am going to stay home and count over 300 playboy magazines that I wanted to auction off tonight, what do you all think??? I should lug in those Playboys to pawn off for money for the team.  Leave your two cents n the guestbook.  Oh, last night was Farbeon's venue of " Password " was a slight treat. The sensitive one had a feature there and the mule was packed and off to Route 85A we went.  Thank the Parking Gods for letting me find a parking spot right in front of the venue. So, it was different. The venue has a very intimate setting. The lights are low and one thing i did love, guns painted on the wall. Glocks and sigs used as decorative tid bits around the bar. I did love that. Once again, the freestyle aspect of it didn't do it for me. I have nothing against it but I have gotten so used to going to venue's  and just hearing poetry, that it is hard for me to hear people freestyle their rap. Then, I grew up with Peter Guns and lord Fariq, Chadio, Fat Joe, Pun , and a serious caucaphony of underground rappers that make heads spin. So, in seeing some freestyle that is Off the hook, it is hard to impress me.   Regardless, we all did our thing. Oscar, Obona, Jai, Rich, Omri shined on the microphone. It was a little bit loud at the back and it had my nerves kicking in overdrive but I got up there and just did what I had to do. Good venue, great potential to have it packed with standing room only. I met up with some Urban poets taht I salmmed with several months back. It is always good to make a connect. I was happy, I sold a 5 past 13 CD and that makes 12. Yea BABY!!!!!!! If I could sell 18 before Tuesday, that would make my goal of 30 before nats.   So, everything is good and my days will be spent taking care of my stuff to head to nats.  I have to pack and make sure that I have everything for this 12 hour drive. I am looking forward to this beyond all the imagination that I could ponder.   Ok, I have nothing really more to write but I will construct a good bye blog to post before my trips begins. Ok, folks, take care and be safe.  Peace, Love,  Chuletas con papas  Fish

       Clash of the Fish   I won't write it, I won't.  Anyway, I woke up this morning and I clicked on the TV and I see.....  urlLink Clash of the Titans!!!! . This movie rocked on so many levels. I was never a fan of Greek mythology I always thought and then I had a revelation after I saw this movie this movie. Shit, I should really start studying about all these crazy monsters, myths, Gods, and mythical creatures. There was a part on the movie where the Goddess Thetis has a son ( calibos ) and Zeus ( the head God ) threw this curse on him. He turned him into this devil swamp thing mix. So Calibos has a thing for Princess Andromeda and he kept on giving her these retarded riddles that no suitor could solve.Only the suitor that could solve the riddle could get into Andromed's toga thong.  Until Perseus went into this swamp after Andromeda and realized that Calibos was the one keeping suitors away. Of Course, Perseus hormones is buggin out because Andromeda is hot and he really wants to tap that ass. Heehee, I had to get ghetto. Perseus fights Calibos and chops off his hand. He goes back to suit Andromeda and solves the riddle because it was the ring that Calibos wore that no one ever saw, that was the riddle.  Calibos prays to his mother ( the Goddess thetis ) to make the people of Joppa Pay. Perseus and Andromeda are about to be wed in matrimonial bliss ( with permission from that old bastard the Pope because they are not GAY!!, oh God, I just left the point) Then in the Sanctuary of the Goddess Thetis, the statues head crumbles off. It speaks and says that the Andromeda has to be sacrificed to the Krakken  ( Godzilla's little brother with a temper ) in 30 days untouched by man. Oh shit, she might die and never get touched by the Perseus man meat.  After that, everything just got better.    Medusa has Issues  Medusa made a cameo appearance and even gratuitously killed two dudes. One was harpooned by an arrow, the other was turned to stone. Perseus of course prevailed and chopped Medusa's head off.  Giant scorpions attacking the camp at night made for interesting skeeving of my nerves. A two headed dog was comic relief as perseus shiskabobs him with an awesome sword I might add.  Flying metallic Gold Owls, Pegasus the flying horse that never once took a shit during the movie. A helmut that made perseus invisible. Three witches that had a craving for human flesh. Hot chics in toga's. The movie was awesome. It toggled and switched on the imagination that I love so dearly.      I walked to work wondering what type of Mythical creature I would like to be. Would I be my own creature ?? I always liked the Half man half horse. Knowing me, I would be half man , half Fish. Kinda like Aqua man.  Oh oh, I am going into the relms of  " comic bookdom ". I am not doing it because I am in no way, shape, or form,  an authority on that.   Anyway. I am out, Folks, have a great safe weekend. Get laid, Swallow, drink,  Party tonight that I will not attend at Ginna's Isle's Poetry reading tomorrow at Bowery that I won't be at neither. I will be at the LouderJAM sunday to Rock out with Ray with a song in tow.  Peace, Love,   Chuletas con BBQ!!!!  Fish

       Tonight........   I am feeling kinda " short Winded " today. Not really much to come from my mind. I actually feel good but I just don't have much to say.   Yesterday was good. I spent all day in the house and made sure that I made worth of every penny of rent that I paid.  I wrote a couple of e-mails here and there and mainly just bonded with the remote and the sony. Nothing even closely interesting on the boob tube yesterday. After the obligatory porno, I floundered across Discovery. Did you all even know that Hippo's kill more Human's in Africa then all other animals combined?? That is scary, if someone calls me a hippo from now on, I will just give them my signature crooked evil smile. PROPS TO FAT PEOPLE!!!  Ok, on Saturday night, a couple of cops wanted to give some Kats a ticket for drinking in public. One dude tried to stop the cops from issuing a summons. He tried to perpertrate himself as a Police Officer. When the cops roughed him up, behold...................... bottles, rocks , and everything that was easily a projectile was used. Everything stopped when the cop shot his gun one time in the air. After that, everyone ran home and it made headlines in the news. That area is about one block from where I live. A whole bunch of young bucks that have nothing to do but sell weed and act up. They don't bother me so they can do whatever they please.  Ok, let me get back to work.

       Vicarious triumph and dissappointment   Ah, yes. The world of Poetry has really took a front seat for me since this Friday. I am taking this day off with a beautiful smile on my face and no regrets. Let me back track and give you all the best possible blog entry.  Friday after work was my first jaunt into Rikers Island. I know I know, I must have written that several times over. Let me just get into the class. I got to Rikers and the best thing about getting there in the late afternoon is the clear path you have getting into the jail. As soon as I got into the control building, 5 mins later, I was already walking into class. " Happy" was the only word to describe when I got there, the local class comedian already wrote a poem on the black board.  Yes, a test of wits and patience. I looked at the board, and I say, " wow, nice poem " . Then I corrected the spelling and issued my personality as the authority figure. I did the " Naming " exercise where each student had to find a word to describe them with the same first letter of there name. I started it off and I was " Fresh Fish". SO a couple of "Respectful Rich, Articulate Arnie, Justifying Jose, Kind Kevin, Jingoistic Jermaine,etc......the class started well.  I introduced " The book of genesis according to St Miguelito ". This is a poem of one of the lately departed founders of the Nuyorican poetry movement. They loved the poem and they broke it down with ease. I do say this, this class has incredible potential. That is keeping me very happy as a poetry instructor. I gave them an exercise to write a poem about there neighborhood and what they missed. I got back very very good poems ( considering that these guys haven't really been educated. Great first day at Rikers.  As I left and quickly remembered that Karen Jaime from the Nuyorican has my check for a past feature spot, I drove to the NUYO. I was happy to be there. Willie Perdomo read as he only knew how. I can't say anything to describe Willie as almost 90 percent of all poets look at him as a forefather to poetry. His style is amazing. His poetry is insprational with a complex tone that makes you say " Wow ". As everything was going well with the slam, I bumped into a dude that I haven't seen in 13 years.My man Louie is home.  He did his bid and now he is out to try and become a productive member of society.  I was happy to see him. I wasn't reading that night at the NUYO but I would have loved to drop one poem and dedicate it to him.   The slam was pretty good and desiree Marshall did her thing. Shit, she beat Tai Freedom Ford. Since I have a bias towards my 13 brethren, I was hoping Tai took the slam. Yet, she was hot on the trails of Desiree.  Eventually, I'll hit that NUYO stage. I am in no rush. I will be around for a long time.  So, on to Saturday as I got dressed and drove the hooptie to the Bowery to catch Taylor's " Teacher Teacher ". There is nothing possibly bad I can say about this show. Taylor was fantastic. His show was a personal dig into his life about teaching and poetry. His fire is what feeds the other fires. The intricate details of his life, experience, comedic standpoint were amazingly well crafted. As he says he has a Masters in Literature. This is what can only describe him, a master in literature. Next Saturday at 3pm is the last showing of Teacher Teacher. If you do not catch this show, you will die incomplete. This is the show that will give you a complete first hand view of what makes taylor tick. Catch it.  Headed over to Cornelia Street Cafe to see Rich feature. As the up-start Diva that he is, he was late. Poetically incorrect was extremely light yesterday as not too many people showed up. The Migente troupes are getting rather scarce these days. That is what made of most of the poetry contingient when Poetically Incorrect came around. Rich got up there and did his thing with a eclectic mix of old and new. Even though his old work is barely a month, I have heard it so it's old to me. He did a cover of the poem that I taught at Rikers and it made for a good strong point for me. Desiree got up and did her thing also. That girl is funny, talented, and greatly sincere. I am going to feature for her at Hofstra, it is going to be a pleasure.  Left there and walked back to the Bowery. ah yes, this is where the Drama comes in. You think I was going to write all this nice stuff without inserting drama. NO no no...........  Pepatian is an organization that puts on shows in the Bronx and around the city. Guy featured for them last year and it was very nice seeing different artist bringing their talent to the Bowery. On the bill lat night were John Rodrguez, Flaco Navaja, Rockefella, La Bruja and several others. Should I give a detailed over view of what happened last night?? NO!!!!!! It would be a waste of my time. It would be toooo much energy put into this blog and I might die of a heart attack after experiencing unnecessary aggravation.  Firstly, they had the same guy from last years show that had a shpiel about " how his roomate refused to flush". I walked away when I saw him get on the stage. I was not going to bare another 15 minutes of worhthless jargon. There was no point artistically, dramtically, poetically to his set on the stage. You know that I do not openly hate on people. This guy is horrid.  Then, another lowpoint in the show was " la Bruja ". Maybe, I have been subjected to a rather high bar of professionalism at Bar 13. I just feel that is you are a poet and you are being billed as a poet. What the fuck, read your poetry!!! She went up there and set the stage for 4 bullshit haikus and a " Don Jose " bit. As I blatantly set my hopes on high for her, I was shocked to see her going up there and ranting and raving over bullshit. Then she would laugh at her own jokes and the majority of the Bronx crowd would laugh with her. It broke my heart that these people would have the bowery space for nothing more then a " fiesta ". Garbage humor coupled with badly written monologues has destroyed Pepatian in my eyes. If we were to be solicited by Jane and Pepatian, I would kindly decline for the fear that I would be put in a show where my hard work as a poet would be destroyed.    Out of everyone I saw there last night, only one person I would consider for a future Acentos Feature. That would be Flaco Navaja. Thing is, he was surrounded by such bad talent, it even made him look bad.  I was driving home aggravated that we are trying to be poets that celebrate our heritage, culture, and life. Then, we have savages destroying any hope of a positive professional persona in the latino community. I think they are all cool people but they have to think of the mission that faces us latino's and the stereo type we are trying to erase.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       A Sad reality   I am at home and I can't believe that another young brother has been killed. Far be it from me to " create drama " but too many are dying. This one has touched home rather closely to the poetry communinty. This Kat, Matt Hall was 18 years old and he was shot in the back on a Harlem Street corner. He died about a day later. He was leaving a meeting with the  " Universal Zulu Nation of Hip-Hop ". He was an honors student at Hunter College. So, it seems that he had his life in order. What begs the question, Why was he shot? What happened that someone had to pull a gun and shoot him in the back? A piece of me is really standing firm against his membership in the " Zulu Nation ". I don't know if tha could have resulted in his death. Zulu, as I recalled it from my days was a " gang " that was birthed from the dark annals of the mind of "Afrikka Bambaata ". It was born in Bronx River around 1984 give  or take. I knew many " Zulu " members . THe used to call themselves Kings and Queens. At the upstart, they were a typical gang that participated in everything that a gang does. Fights, assaults, killings, muggings, robbery were the norm. I lost track of them after I " Grew Up ". Unfortunately, many young brothers and sisters are lured to this " Organization " with the promise of peace, change, and harmony. It is so hard for me to buy that. Especially when I literally fought several Zulu members in my time. Zulu members are also a known " Gang affiliated" entity in the NYC Jail system. IF these " Zulu " people have changed and they are dedicated to all that is good, I give them my utmost respect. If not, they are the stereotypical bunch of thugs that do nothing but leech the life of a upstanding society.   As I did not know Matt personally, I feel for his family. The kat that shot him in his back is a coward. IF you are going to shoot somebody, look at them in the face and pull the trigger. If you can live with the life being drained from their eyes, then you are a killer. If not, you are a bitchass that deserves whatever justice is coming to remove you from the community. I mean this as the cops can catch you and lock you up. Even better, live by your gun, a bullet has your name on it. I personally can tell you that how it works.  R.I.P young poetry Brother.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Out of 100............    ......... I would have raped 99!!! Guys, yesterday was the opening of a new flagship store on 5th avenue called " Mexx ". Of course, with all the NYC fashion hoopla, balloons, camera's, Stereo systems, model's, and a cheap gimmick were all introduced at a vain attempt to have people walk into this store. For the record, the marketing behind it was genius considering that it pandered to every schmuck with a low -self esteem. As I walked passed the store, a rather annoyingly voiced lady was shouting, " Be our next model, have your face across Times Square, Pick a number and live your dream ". I would compare her voice between a cross of Steve Urkel from the now dyfucnt show of " Family matters"  and Rosie Perez multiplied several times over. As I walked slowly to take in this debacle. I noticed the incredible array of " beautiful people ". I use that word " Beautiful " very loosely and as sarcastically as possible. Models upon Models in a span of one block.  Scantly clad women hoping that the exposure of clevage would give them a shot at " Bill Board " stardom. Uh, the guys were buffed, tall, with the bestly primped eyebrows I have ever seen. Walking down this block was like a bad episode of " Blind date ". There had to be more hair gel and make-up on that one block then all of NYC put together. Here is the kicker, out of the 100 guys that I saw hoping to have their face plastered on a billboard, I would have fucked 99 of them. I have no qualms completely and unabatedly sexually violating one of these model dudes. I know my Lenny is gorgeous but some of these guys look rather scrumtious.  It's just not right to see these dudes, buffed, good looking, and making this Derek Zoolander type of living.    It is not right.  So if you are a good looking model guy, you better hope I never get arrested with you.   Peace, Love, Porkchops.

       Pedro Neruda.........   ............. is really Pablo Neruda. Why do I keep calling him " Pedro "? This means that the name Pedro is stuck in my head for a reason but I just have to figure it out.   So, I am going to quickly attack the subject  of  " sentence structure and Grammer ". You all mainly know that my Blog is straight forward. What keeps my blog real?? I always figured my mistakes and poorly structured sentences is what gave me my own style. I am not ging to cop a plea and say anything. I make many mistakes. I just don't bother to re-read my blog 40 times to make it sound like te " wall street journal " to impress anybody. I write it and I leave it as is to create that sense of " me ".  I guess in order for me to prove that I do have the ability to " write correctly " is to go over my blog and e-mails with a fine tooth comb. This will insure proper grammer and sentence structure. So for now on, my blog will read like a thesis by an overzealous student.  I just had to get that out, well, to keep with conformity, fuck that. I am still Fish and this is what makes me.   Anyway...........  Tonight was an incredible night of Pablo Neruda Poetry. The City Graduate center was the location where an auditorium was packed.  about three hundred people had to have fit in there and every seat was taken.  The tribute had several Poets participating.  The main poet that I wanted to see and hopefully meet was Martin Espada. He is a Puerto Rican poet with an array of books under his belt.  After the reading, we milled around chit chattin with Roger, Lynne, Rob Neil, Oscar, and brother Rich. We made a couple of attempts to see Martin but he was surrounded by more Doctoral flesh then an OB-GYN convention. Once Lynne and Rich made the bold move to go up to Martin, I followed and kept the back ground warm as I wanted Rich to meet him and have his glory. Very well placed introductions and a hand shake or two, success was putting it lightly. We met Martin Espada, We mentoned Acentos. We gave him a flyer. A dialogue was opened and this is what makes me happy.  Going home, Rich and I were throwing some ideas into the air about Espada and a feature. I think we actually came up with some very good start up thoughts. Once everything goes into effect, we will have this incredible game plan of getting these high quality features.  Well, let me get back to the Neruda tribute. When the lights went out, they opened with an original recording of Neruda reading a poem. The poem was on the CD " Algo de mi vida ". The readers for the night were Ariel Dorfman, Jorge del Rio,  Rafael Campo, Martin Espada, John Felstiner, Edward Hirsch, Jane Hirshfield, Galway Kinnell, Gary Soto, Ilan Stavens.   All read poems by Neruda and mostly translated by them also. This new anthology had over 600 poems to be chosen. That is a solid 600 poem by Neruda. I can't even fathom having the 5 solid pieces morphing into more then 10.  I asked Roger how many he had and he said, " A couple of hundred ". That seems like such a far off bridge for me to cross.  Tonight's tribute gave me a different sense of what Neruda accomplished. He was a poets poet. It makes ya wonder how many people he alone inspired to become poets. His style was worldly and almost scary. Some of the choices of his words were  explosives. I never thought that so few words put together can have such an impact.  When someone tells me that I bring such energy to my poem, I don't consder that a compliment any more. I want to engage with skill and craft before anything else.I still have a long way to go. I have time and I am in no rush.  :-)  Did I make a mistake??  Did it still sound like ME?   I Should go back and make a few more mistakes.  heehee  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Pug and ponies.....   The pony thing was just to throw something after Pug to give it some conformity. The pug thing is where I am standing on my list of " wants ". I have always wanted a pug ( little dog from men in black II ). Those dogs are truly cute. I just wanted to share that.  Well, everything is going good and we are getting great ideas flowing on several fronts. I think my plate is full and I am putting off on any other projects. My main concern is for my feaeture at Acentos on November 25. I already am making phonecalls. I called one of my first hardcore supporters yesterday and made the threat " You have no choice, I want you to be there ". I am working on three solid new pieces, two of them are collabo's. Actually, Someone has to get on the ball and work on the collabo and forward it to LISA!!!!!!  HELLO??????? So, I am going to send out the e-mail October 24. Fish is going to feature and you all know that I don't play when it comes to that.  Well, time to go  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Just wanted to share ..........     ............ ok, I am at home and I am flicking through the TV. As usual, the normal array of Non-sense television is running pretty wild these days. Yet, with my grautitous cable coming to play, good movies do occasionally find there way to my Sony trinitron. Tonight, I had a choice between Godfather II or Casualties of War. I took option " b" and started watching the movie with Michael J. Fox in the lead role as a Soldier with a conscious in Vietnam. The premise of the movie was behind four soldiers in the " bush " ( battlefield) that at one point raided a village and took a vietnamese girl hostage. Out of 5 soldiers, 4 of them were pretty much raping and beating this girl except of FOX. He was the one that had the " good guy " conscious and didn't do anything. Fast forward.......... girl was killed, Fox told everybody, no one cared, someone listened, it was pushed, 4 go to trial, end of movie.  Vietnam is not much to me personally. I have uncles on my mothers side that fought in vietnam. It makes me think if there is any ruth to the atrocities that occured in vietnam. Some movies, documentaries, and reports really detail as vividly as possible about what really happened.Yet, I wasn't there. How can I get a feel about what people truly went through?  War is not a good thing. Lately, we have had some movies that really give you true reality as to the harshness of war. Still, think of the of the worst thing possible and multiply that several times over. That is the only thing that makes it worth writing.   So, as history has a tendency to repeat itself. We have a vietnam of our generation in the form of " Iraq". Have you ever seen me write anything about Iraq?? Well, it's a tricky subject for me. I never once believed these testicularly challenged white house bottom dwellers about the " weapons of Mass destruction ". As time goes by, you can clearly tell the lies, deceit, and media control that was made evident in the transripts of recent weeks. I loved the whole " Blame the CIA " concept. Where is my stance on Iraq? I don't want our soldiers there. We don't need more people dying in a country where most kids have no clue where to find on a map. Yet, since we are there, let it be known that U.S soldiers have the ability to kick ass.   Well, my time is up.   Peace, love, Porkchops  P.S. did anyone read the LOUDNOTES, I DID NOT PUT IN GROOVENATION!!!!! That is the corniest name in the history of LOUDER!!!!

       Feeling different   Well, back onto the track of normalcy. If I was ever normal then it would be a good thing. I am back in the job and I haven;t killed anybody today. I was really stressed out since late Monday. Yet, I took that and put it on the back burner and hoped it would die. Sure enough, getting to Acentos, it happened.  My stress wnet out the window after seeing a packed house at the Blue Ox that made Bar 13 on Monday look trivial. We actually had more at Acentos the 13. There is something really wrong with that. I hope a game plan comes into play to get the crowd back to " A little bit louder Monday ".  Yesterday was good as it was our first foray into a concept that we are all trying to envision. I don't really want to say much but we have that fire in a group of five that will take NYC by storm.  Last night, I went to Ed Garcia's house and he has to be the best fuckin host in all the United States.  This guy plus his significant other had more food then we could handle.  I was like, Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..... PLEASE, NO MORE!!!!! LOL. In talking to Ed on such a personal level, he is  truly a gifted individual with apirations that challenge our most ardent dreamer. We spoke about so much and I left there with a sense of re-newed faith in life and poetry.  I am trying to maintain my sanity as my past life and ways are seeping over to what I am currently living. I am good at some things but I am a master at others. The others are my ability to get incredibly ghetto without a forethought.  I know, I know, " Think of the consequences ", as of now, I have many concerns and one of them is doing what I have to do to get what is owed to me.   Well, I am going to cut this short as I have to start some other endeavors.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Just tired......     I think I hit the overload marker.  Too many things coming at me.  Not enough output.  Job is really sucking.  Creatively, I am doing ok, I am still reading and soaking everything in.  Cave-Canem was awesome.  I feel like a poser sometimes.  I write but am I good?  Should I get these accolades?  I am not even close to where these people are.  Random thoughts. Official loser.  Wanting to change the world but the world is making it hard. Am I a slammer? Am I a poet? Am I a writer? What am I? Need time alone. funked out deep dark sad kinda lonely random thoughts feel like crying there is the tear why cry? you are a poser You are not a writer Fish You are not a poet random thoughts Deep heavy thoughts My shoulders collapsing more tears tears Confused wanting to change the world The world is changing me

       Things run smooth.......   ......and I am happy. For some reason, things are taking a step in a direction which is making me all giddy inside. We are making great strides in improving Acentos, ourselves, life and dare I say, even Louder has to change. I haven't been too happy lately because it seems that things have reached this stalemate. Nothing going on, no vision, no nothing. I hope we get some electricity going. I get bored really quick with some things.   Yesterday was a very rewarding experience with us Hosting " Poetas con Cafe " down in Spanish Harlem. Everyone was warm and inviting. We made an incredible impression and they loved the energy that we brought to the show.  When I opened the open mic, I said a couple of choice things and Oscar followed suit.  When I gave him the second half, he ran with it and I was excited as hell.   Life is really starting to come together.  I have plenty going on with Rikers, the Community word Project, Hope Community, Fortune society. Sooner or later, I am going to have my finger in so much, I am going to run out of fingers. Don't forget, I am short three fingers and I might need a little more. LOL  I don't know if making this here would make it offical for everyone in the poetry world. As of Last week, Rich Villar is an offical member of the Acentos Coalition. Oohhh........ I like that. " The Acentos Coalition " of poetas. LOL. I have been fumbling with the idea of having a fresh face and voice added to our little world. Rich fits there and brings with him a fire and energy that keeps our fire bright and even surpasses ours. So any questions concerning Acentos could be directed to Rich with the utmost certainty that he is in the loop with the concerns and well being of our coalition.  Don't hold that word " Coalition " to Acentos yet, it is not official.  We have some good dates coming up.....  October 9 - Acentos and co will appear on WBAI 99.5. Be ready for the official announcement once I get the confirmations  October  10 - Acentos has a gig a locale TBA  October 14 - Latino heritage and Poetry invade Hofstra.   Life is good.  Peace, Love, Pork chops

       I am yearning some downtime..........   Oh god. I need some time away from Poetry, Events, Life. I need some time dawgs!!!!  Anyway, so much went on this weekend. I had the opportunity to feature with brother Rich at the Clinton Street Festival. I do say that it was interesting to see a festival packed with several hundred latino's but about ten interested in the poetry. Still, Rich went up there and gave it all and got a good feedback. After he did his three poems, I went up and did my thing. Not many people were seemingly interested but I still garnered the  attention of afew and directed my poetry at them. I so destryoed one of my pieces but it was my fault for not rehearsing. Like if they would really know. After the festival, we headed to the Bronx Museum of the ARTS for the " re-Verse fesitival 2003. The first item up for viewing was a documentary featuring the life and times of Audry Lorde. If you want a more detailed description, go check Rich's Villars Blof and he will give you the lowdown.   I would complain about the panelist but I have no energy to do so and it seems like old news.   I rather just write about today. I was asked to host " Poetas con Cafe " for the Hope Community not for profit foundation. The event was held at the Modesto Gardens and it was a nice and right in the middle of spanish harlem.  The first half of the open mic was very very light but it finished well. Oscar was my co-host as I fet that we both would benefit from this event. As Oscar introduced and schmoozed with the features and VIPS, it as well worth our time and energy. It was a totally different vibe  then what I have seen and I think it good relationship will come from this.  Anyway, let me bounce  Everything is going back to normal tomorrow  Peace

       Round peg in square hole????   I usually wake up in the morning and I throw on my CD player on random and I have a mix of 5 Poetry cd's.  The 5 in there now would be.......  Celena Glenn Bernard Dolan Carlos Mena Taylor Mali: convictions Roger's Bonair's Agard's greatest hits. LOL  So this morning I am getting dressed and listening when the CD stops on Bernard's Dolan's cut. For some reason, I can't get past that CD. He only has one cut that I like and the rest I can truly do without. I know that my opinion is just that but I can't stand that techno synthesizer stuff. There was one cut on the cd that was just plain weird. I always have this cautious relationship between Poetry and music. I tend to shut out the music to just get to the poetry. When the music ( or whatever there is ) is overcoming the poetry, that is too much for me. I do have to say that Celena has an off the hook CD that I am letting my boys here and them fools think it's rap. I am like " uh, it's poetry ".  Taylor Mali's Conviction if riding high in the ghetto's too. The favorite so far...... " Stick and stones will break bones but my words will fucking kill you " . That seems to be resonating as the general favortie.  Well, long weekend with too much to do but no time. Class, Poetry, car repair's, dinner for my Moms. It's her Birthday. She thinks she slick and tries not to mention it. I am cooking her favorite shrimp dinner tonight.  She loves shrimp scampi and such. My mother has hit the young old age of 67. That is not old if you see my mother, she looks 40. I love my moms, I never got along with her but we have built something really solid since I got locked up. I guess she knew that my temper could either kill me or get me locked. She hasn't really pried that much into my life and that is a good thing. I should put her number down and have everyone call her just to say Happy Birthday. LOL. She would kill me.   Ok folks, have a great weekend. I hope you all have a safe Saturday and Sunday.

       Quick note.........    :)  Que pasa people. Everything is going well today. Got to work and I am having my Orange Juice with some type of Croissant type thing.  I am not much to eat breakfast but I get in these health conscious moods sometimes.    Last night, I mainly stood home working on a new piece. This is going to be a doozy. It is a celebratory " FUCK  YOU " to the New York State board of Parole. I am done on October 7, 2003. My days are counting down and I am giddy. 5 years of Urine deposit, Blood deposit, aggravation, threats of violations. The last five years of my life hasn't been all that great. Dealing with bullshit of being on " conditional release " is not fun. I try to tell the Thugs and hooligans that I call friends to stop the bullshit. Most of them just give me the occasional " ok " and they keep on. Just yesterday, I found out that one of my boys blew trial ( He was convicted ). If anyone read the Daily News yesterday, Robert Williams was found guilty of Attempted murder. Big deal huh??? Look at this....  This kid  ( Ramos ) was watching softball game. Williams drives by and sees him. He gets out of the truck and Ramos sees him. Ramos starts running and williams chases him. Williams shoots him in the back and empties a 9mm into his body. Does it finish here??  NO. The softball game being played was between two local precints. So, on the teams were definitely 18 off duty cops. They started chasing him and he car jacks a ladies car and leads the cops a " high speed " chase. He gets stuck in traffic and they catch him. Ok, so knowing a small tidbit about the law, most likely they hit him with the following........  attempted Murder ( for shooting Ramos ) Criminal Possesion of a weapon ( 9 mm ) Evading arrest ( Running ) Assault ( on the car jack victim ) Kidnapping ( The car jack victim ) Grand Larceny ( taking the car ) Wreckless endangerment ( shooting of gun and driving like a mental case ) Resisting arrest ( General principle )  So when you are locked up, the prosecutor want to get a win regardless. So they offered him 7 years and he didn't take it. He wanted to hire our " famed " lawyer that hasn't lost a case for us in years. This lawyer can get Saddam and Osama off if he wanted to. Right before trial, they offered him 10 years but he decided to take it to trial.   He has the victim saying " It was him that shot me 12 times " He has the cops saying " It was him who we chased " He has the Lady saying " IT was him that took my car "  Williams gets on the witness stand and tesitfies, " it wasn't me ". Come on!!!!!!! Come up with something more creative then that. Plead stress to the blackout or something.  So 1 hour later, the jury comes back and they find him guilty on all counts.  Let's take a tally  Attempted Murder - 15 years Grand Larceny - 7 years Assualt - 5 years The 9mm - 5 years Kidnapping - 5 years rest of charges - 7 years total   I think he is doing at least 32 years. Did I mention that this was his third strike??? He can possibly do life with no parole.  So, when he comes out ( if ), he should be about 60.   Makes ya wonder, it's not really worth it. If you decide to do something, do it right.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       I am the sensitive one!!!!!!   LOL. Yes, last night I delved into the sensitive side of me and expermented with a whole new genre of " Sensitive Poetry ". So, first sensitive piece, first draft and I made it to the second round. I got dropped kicked in the second round but I felt like  broke down doors with my " Praise " piece. ROger sent out a challenge on the NYC slam list serve to write a praise piece and slam with it in the Open Slam. Since i have testicles the size of pool balls, I took the challenge and was proud that I got a good enough score to get to the second round. I am actually questioning my style in what is making me a successful Slam poet. I know I have the ability to be a loud poet. Now I am experimenting with a different voice and style. Nothing is better then learning and mastering different styles of whatever you are good at.   I had a great time last night. I was hosting and it went pretty smooth. Nothing bad nor aggravating. Soon, host are not getting paid. I think that is the proper thing to do. Hosting is not really a job, it is more of a privledge in my eyes. I have no problem hosting and not getting paid. It is a learning tool that will make my resume look sharp.  " Oh my God, you hosted Bar 13 on a Monday, That must be hard ". " Well Honey, I am JUST THAT GOOD!!!! " LOL. So last night I went home and truly raped my Lenny, from here to Monday, I ravished her body until 6 this morning. Uh wait a minute. Wrong journal. I have to write that in my personal journal. Forget I just wrote that.  Last night I was really feeling ghetto and the White Castle was calling. I needed to get a couple cheesburgers and chicken Rings in my system to remove that ghetto murder burger inkling that I had. You can't go wrong with a couple of burgers here and there. It is a good way to get in ca-hoots with that side that you tried to leave behind.  All is good.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  ****************  Praise Poem ******************  Ponder some moments  Heart tugging memories where you give thanks.  Think Wonder, imagine On a breezy fall day,  a child runs to his mother crying after falling and scraping both knees,  a warm touch,  a reassuring smile,  a kiss that only a mother knows how to give,  that child will always praise his mother  Crowded subway cars constricting lungs aggravation forcing heads to an agitated bow 15 hour work day no energy to stand.  Disheartened,  A kind old lady grabs your shoulder and offers you her seat.  You sit and give thanks to her . beautiful eyes return a gracious " your welcomed ".  Praise her genuine kindness.  After a traditional Sunday dinner, you share a moment with your father he tells you, "  I love you " and " you  have always have made me proud " ,  no more  words,  you hug an endless embrace you cry 30 years of uncertainty away you love an undying love You praise your  paternal hero    One day you get a phone call from a friend, he is in need.  As you are there ,  you will walk to the end of eternity for him,  he seeks true friendship.  you share his pain,  you console his broken heart,  His failed endeavor His questionable friendship becoming solid You insert faith, he adds hope, together,  You save his life, Praise true friendship  In those moments........... Aide in the sensitivity and vulnerablity of life. Run a steady hand through the warm , inviting river currents of  praise Surf the ocean's sky calmly Find a solemn peace within you Teach the Angels harmony, while showing them  meanings of new found serenity Praise what means most to you,  cherish honor, appreciate No need to yell, No need to rant Be prudent and  unleash your power of love on us the un-deserving the hapless the underpriviledged,............................................and make this world beautiful   Fish The LouderARTS Project

       intellect and progress......   Oh man, this weekend was good. I got a plenty of work done and I am happy. I finally finished the syllabus for the 16 week Rikers workshop that I am doing. I am going to introduce many good poets to my students. I have Patircia Smith, Cheryl Boyce Taylor, Asha Bandele, Jeff McDaniel, Martin Espada, Langston Hughes, Piri Thomas, Regie Cabico, Billy Collins, Taylor Mali. Sam Vargas. Yes, I threw one of my poems in there to give them a sense of " community " when writing a piece about their neighborhood. I tried to put in some variety in different poets. I wanted to give the students a taste of the whole genre. I have political poems, cultural poems, persona poems, humor poems. I want to give them a taste of everything. I even have two showcases planned. I might even try to throw in a third by having the students read their work in a showcase.   I am really getting excited about this program.  I hope that more people will take initiative and accompany me to Rikers to get a feel of the real world.  There is a huge difference between a work shop at Rikers and a workshop in the outside world.    Everything is going well with me. I took part in a mentor training program and it was awesome. I learned so much in the many, many, many hours that I was there. That shit was actually hard sitting for 8 hours. Then, I want to go home and relax and unwind and drama unfolds. LET A BROTHA CHILL!!!!!!!! It is not easy for me to have things thrown into my lap and me just roll with the punches. I engulf myself with the work to make sure that every detail is covered. Whatever I am responsible for, I take care of.   Let me run.  I love em but the JETS are really sucking!!!!!!!!!!!  Peace, Love, Pork Chops   Fish

       Let's discuss something....    I am 32 years old with some serious stress that has plagued my life. I won't try to hide it, I even anoounced most of my issues in an open forum for discussion. All this stress never weighed that heavily on me, physically. I have a full head of hair, I am rather healthy, I have no wrinkly pockets of skin around my face, My chin is still alone and hasn't gained company yet. My hair is even all the natural color and it is not GRAY.   But wait people, when I look, as all health conscious men should be, and I discover a gray testicle hair, we have issues. This is nothing new because I have discovered gray hairs there several times. I just really got disturbed when I was watching " sex in the city " and she found a grey hair and flipped. It makes me wonder, " will Fish have old man balls before he even gets old "?? That is scary.   Time to go  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       NEVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I will never ever root for any other football team besides my JETS!!!!!! No way in hell will I betray my team in that way! NEVER!!!! I am waching the game now and I do say that Testeverde is as useful as a flying flaming lesbian naked in my apartment. Santana Moss got the nerve to drop a pass but he made up for it by a nice long catch to get a touchdown.   I love the Jets. Ever since big Joe Klecko got me to playing football. My first green Jersey had klecko's number on it and I was truly loving the fact that my FAT Body was useful at some sport.  I miss it but I need to stay healthy and not try to get hurt. I have to much going on.   ANYWAY!!!!!!!!  I AM GOING TO GO ROOT FOR THE JETS!!!!!!! Even if they had 44 bootleg dominican's playing for them, I will always love the GREEN!!!!!!!  J- E-T-S ! JETS JETS JETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  peace

       Who's next???    Ok, I knew Johnny Cash was on his last legs and about to enter that great Jamboree in the sky. Now, I would have never expected John Ritter to buy the farm. I woke up this morning ( extremely Cranky mind you ) to turn on the TV and hear that Johnny Cash died. I am like, he was old and had one step in the grave anyway. Then, John Ritter died of a heart Ailment after getting ill on the set of his new Show " 8 simple rules for dating my Teenage daughter ". I was shocked to hear that he died. Yesterday, I read in the Paper that Sean kimmerling died of testicular cancer.  That is the sportscaster for the WB 11 news. I actually met that kat at a party last year. He was cool and was a true blue sports nut. He was 37 years old and he died. He wasn't married and had no kids.   Does anyone think that when a person dies, death comes in three's??? I know it's an old fable but I have seen it and even experienced it. Not death moron's. I have known people to die in three. Last brush with death came last year when a friend of mines, Angel, died of an asthma attack. Then Nelson got stabbed in a fight and killed. Then boobie was shot and killed. All within the span of a couple of months.   Not to sound like a fool, but when someone I know dies. I walk a serious straight line. Especially when it is in March. I know WAY too many people that have died in March.  Short blog today.

        I say.........    My condolences to my friends and family which have lost loves one's in the September 11, 2001 tragedy.      Back to my life........   Today, I have sooo many things in my head that I want to write about.  I actually was ready to write this whole novel on the " Latin Kings ". Then, I thought about it, I won't and refuse to give them any room on my blogger.  So, here is a list of what I would like to write about  sex Why do we always have to use the bathroom at the worst times? Mouth farts What really freaks me out Should I go through my idea of getting a vasectomy?  Well..... I am in one of those funny retarded moods so I will pick what will make me look like a fool.  I have the  weakest buttcheeks in NYC!! I admit it. I could be laughing and joking around , but, when I get an " attack ". Direct me to the nearest bathroom!!!! Am I going to be picky and say, " oh no, I am not using that bathroom "???, I am going to use whatever facility my fat round ass fits in.   There has been times where I am doing the " dreaded " dance on my way to the bathroom. You know what I am talking about. The crossing your legs over and over again and the bouncing up and down. Then, the closer you get to your apartment, your body plays this really mean trick and doubles the intensity. I have ran many read Lights at speeds "mach one " to get to a bathroom. I have done the " Carl Lewis" to my building. You start opening the door ( You can't find the key ), you swing the door open!!!!!! Throw the keys on the ground....... coat on floor, pants on floor. The trail from the door to the bathroom is everything from hat to socks. Then you get to the bathroom and the biggest relief in the world is a " plop " away. Then, it is just gas. Man, I want to kill myself sometimes. The body is the most comedic instrument known. When you have to go, no warning at all. It just hits you. When you let a little " squeef " out, you shit the hell out of your drawers. It runs all down your legs, you start crying, your social life is thrown to hell. Uh.... Wait, I am not saying that has happened to me but I am just saying.  Like if no one has ever had " un accidente "!!!! Please, we are all between 25 and 40. Wait until 70 comes around, shitting in your pants well be a daily ritual. Hey, if I have a home attendent and she is getting 30 bucks and hour to take care of me, she is going TO EARN THAT MONEY!!!!!!!  Would I let a home attendent wipe my butt?? Man, let me think. I am 70 years old, no action sexually in years, gets to wiping!!!!!!!  I have issues...  Peace, Love, Pork Chops  Fish

       I always leave with a piece of someone    Yesterday was a good day. Acentos proved to be the little engine that could. It had to be the smallest turnout yet but one of the best shows. Small and intimate is good. I always had this twisted thought that the more packed it is, the better the reading. I was wrong. In competing with a free open bar and free shushi, not many people showed up. It is understandable. If Acentos wasn't yesterday, I would be there also.   Yesterday was Karen Jaime's feature and I do have to say that she is off the meter. I had a conversation with her about philosphy.  She, unknowingly, gave me the ending for my " killing " piece.  When we both came into agreement that there is ..... " no universal truth, death, life, right or wrong ", the little light went on and said....... " That is the ending of your piece. In the 20 minute conversation that I had with her, we delved into many different topics and I realized, I knew she was smart, but she is now almost unbelievebly intellgient.   Shit, she dropped 8 poems yesterday and everyone single one was a good poem. She gave a solid set and I was happy as all hell to have her feature for us. I walked away knowing that she is a great person with a great heart with brains that would rival the best in our field.  After Acentos, I made in the Bowery to give Taylor that support from Poet to Mentor. He dropped his CD yesterday ( conviction ) and I picked up a copy. Had a nice candid convo with Taylor about trying to get him up to the Bronx. I am going to get him to Acentos one way or the other. Either when I feature or I will make him feature. AHhhhhhhhhh......... that is an idea. LOL. The cd is a definite buy. Plenty of great poetry. I never seen Taylor read that much but have been blazed everytime he read. He read this piece at the Urbana, Acentos, Union Square slam. It was about his dog that would die in the cold winter months. The piece in on the CD and it is proving to be my favorite. He has " What teachers make ", How to write a political Poem ", Coming out duet ".  I walked away from Taylor with an appreciation of his poetry and kindness.  Last night leaving the Bowery, I saw this dude that looked familiar. I told him either I know you, or I have seen you. Turns out to be the Actor from the HBO show named " the Wire ".  urlLink Andre  was the dude's name and he was really cool. We mainly talked about the show and he was very receptive. It wasn't a fan stalking moment just for you scmucks won't get it twisted. It just amazes me how good the make-up world is. He plays a dope fiend on the show and he has it down to a science. LOL.  I walked away from him happy that he was cool.  Well, not much more to write.   Tomorrow, I write about the Latin Kings ( old time Gang )  Peace, Love, Pork Chops

       Erased from existance......   If I was an " A & R " for any major record label and my responsiblity included recruiting new talent, the company will go under, no one would get signed. Nothing!!!!  I despise Rap music sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I love a good hip-hop album but if I am subjected to a few people just jumping up and down and singing a hook over and over and over again, I won't be happy.  Last night, I went to support brother Rich at Nell's. Chance was hosting this Monday foray into Poetry and what not. The " What not " is the rapping and singing. I wasn't too happy because they opened the doors at 8pm and I got there at 7:45pm. I had to wait outside and you all know that is not my bag of tea. Once inside, I was rather impressed with the set-up Nell's had. It really has some potential. Anyway, the Poetry was really decent last night. Little afro puffin " D Marshall " showed up and did her thing. She is just 19 and she is going to be a serious force on the poetry scene. She wants to make the Nuyorican team and I hope she does. She is going to contact me with a latino showcase she wants us to participate in Hoftra. You know I am calling all the Latino Contingent to get this done.  So expect a phone call from me gentleman and ladies. Anyway, Rich went up there and dropped his talent and left a good vibe on the stage. I did a new piece on the open mic and it got a really good feedback. I was happy. I am trying people, I am trying.  Chance has a really good thing going one over there. I hope it works out and he gets it all going.  This young kat named " Ikeal " was doing this Guitar, singing, beatboxing, thing. He was off the hook. I did my new piece with him in the background and it went off well.  Took a nice long romantic walk with rich to meet the louder folks. heehee, romantic??? I haven't a romantic bone in my body. That is another blog all together. Met up with the masses there and it was cool to see them. I kinda missed them after not seeing them for a week. Oscar, Rich, Matt, and myself stood behind and engaged in some great poetry talk. This one girl passed us by and overheard us and said " you guys are deep ". Another girl passed by and saw me rifling through my book of poetry and asked to read one of my poems. I let her read one and she loved it. Funny was when she went into the bathroom I told the fellas that she went in there to masturbate to what she just read. It was hilarious!!! I know I know, typical man shit. Let me be a dirtbag at least for a couple of seconds.   So, the best part of the night was talking about political pieces and what they really are. How can you write one without sounding like poet # 7, 993. Most political pieces do sound alike and you want to be different. Question is : " How can I write a political piece without having it sound like a rant? ". Most pieces that I have heard are complaining about how things are most of the time. Not many people sit and say how it effects them personally. We started talking about the " ex-girlfriend " pieces. I truly need to write something about my " demon spawn " experience with the child of satan. That might be the most bitter piece that ever came from my mouth.  Great time,   Anyway, let me bounce  Peace, Love, Pork chops  Fish

       My name is Elmer J Fudd, I own a mansion and a yacht   Picture That little bald headed man and the sound of his nasally voice. Ok, you got it?? That is me!! I am not a doctor, nurse, or health professional but can someone please fuckin tell me why only one nostril gets stuffed!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this. You think I get cranky when I don't eat??? Multiply that when I can't breathe about 12 times.   Well, life gets back to normal. Considering that I never considered my life normal, it is back to it. Yesterday was Sunday and the first offical Football sunday and I didn't catch one game. I don't watch sports that much but I can truly  appreciate a game or two to just skim through. Especially when it is a team that I hate getting waxed, beaten, scraped, spanked, killed, violated anally. I miss football. I am considering one last hoorah with my team next year. The original O-line and D-line would come back to go for that chip.  If this comes about, I would start my training and get back up to par.    Well, back to me  p.S I got my tiramisu. 9 months after my birthday.

       ACHOO, SNIFFLE, SNIFFLE    i KNOW complaining isn't my strongpoint but I can try. I AM SICK!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this. I woke up this morning with a headache. I should have known at that point that my day was going to the shitter. It's not that bad. I think I will live.  Funny today was this letter that some schmuck sent to the list serve. It was in regard to Marty and his grievance on how Marty treated him. Uh, The letter that he sent was truly a perfect letter " not to send ". I was too tired to send this kat a nice letter ripping him a new asshole. Then, I was too tired to even think today. So, I just sent a simple letter telling him that it wasn't too smart. Ahhhh......fuck em.  Back to work in the morning,  I don't really want to go but I gotta do it.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

       Fairytale.............   I don't have the proper description of paradise. I do have the memories of the most beautiful wedding that I have ever attended. Yesterday, was the day where things went wrong, people were missing, seats were mixed, Limo's were crashed. Yes, there was a limo involved in a crash. Guess what??? Nothing else matters but Eric and Betsy residing as close to heaven as they are.  The wedding was incredible and the reception was priceless. When we were all getting dressed in Jessica's house, about 4 tux's were all mixed up. Eric didn't get his tie with the suit. They also sent the wrong shirt. Several phone calls later, 3;30pm sharp, Eric was good to go. The Grooms men make their way to the church and we take out designated places, when the music cued, the bridesmaids, flowergirls, parents, uncles & aunts all walk down the aisle.  After that, the bride comes in and I was left speechless ( and it wasn't my lady ). I could only imagine the feelings in Eric little body. Several choice words from the priest about Jesus and some praying ( I was lost ), Eric and Betsy Fernandez came to be on September 6, 2003 @ 4:30pm.  Bulbs flashing, digital cams clicking,Videos recording, tissues wiping away tears ( including mines ), the wedding was perfection.  When we got the limos ( another story all together ) we headed to whitestone park to take some pictures. This is where hell started freezing over. Jessica and I walking arm and arm. Betsy sitting on my knee to take pictures. Not many know the histry but Jessica hasn't liked me in years. Betsy runs right besides Jessica. With this wedding,I stepped to the plate for the sake of the wedding and for the sake of making Eric Happy. Whatever differences Jessica and I had, they were put aside.  Aside for the wedding or for good, I am not sure. It felt really good being somewhere appreciated, loved, and dare I say, needed.  I tried my best to make sure that Eric and Betsy didn't have to deal with shit. This was their day and they don't need stress on the very day of their wedding.  When Jessica, Lisa and Myself got up to give them the key to a room we got them at the marriot. In front of 125 guest, all I had to say..... " Eric, I love you ", Betsy, I love you, and Thank you. " That was my speech, short, poignant, to the point.   What was the best over all feeling of the evening, getting a personal thank you from Eric and Betsy and hearing them say " This wedding wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you ". This is a memory that I will take to my grave. Eric is my brother and I did every single bit possible above and beyond my duty. as Eric says " dude, you really stepped up to the plate "   Time to go  peace

       you know it's bad when............   ............. you are dreaming about your boys wedding. Oh man, I have thrown myself into this thing 100%. Every fiber, cell, ounce or whatever metaphor you want to use, I have done.   Last night as kinda cool. An idea was thrown around to get them a room right after their wedding because they have soooo many people staing in their house. So, Jessica and I collected some money from the bridal party. Last night, I went to the courtyard Marriot to get them a nice room. 200 dollars later, wine, flowers, and something that I will write as soon as I finish this, they have a room. I do have to say they have really lucked out with the Bridal party. I think every single person in that party has this unconditional love for Eric and Betsy. They have shown all of us this true meaning of friendship over the years. Eric has been a true staple in my life. He has been there through some serious thick and thin. He has proved that he is more then a friend. He hit real brother status.   I do have to mention the Gift that we got last night. We all got Personalized swiss army knives. So you see my name across the blade. It is a beautiful thing.  Anyway, let me not bore you guys. I gotta get a haircut ( baldhead ), nails done. I also have to make sure Eric gets a pedicure ( Betsy said I " had " to make sure he got one ). So,he has no choice.   Peace, love, Porkchops  Fish

       Ruff Rough day   Today was a test of patience. I wish I could sit here and write every detail but in respect to some people, I just can't. I just hope there is room and tolerance for forgiveness.  To remain as postive as possible, I got my penguin suit today. I don't believe that I will be wearing a tux for this wedding. I am about to practice the " penguin " laugh.   The dinner rehearsal was really nice. Had food up the wazoo. Brough two plates home to the mother unit for she can eat up a storm.  Oh man, let me go to bed   Peace

       Hee hee...........    I know I know, I said I wasn't going to blog but I broke down not even a day after I said it, I am week. I need help! Is there a bloggers help group?  Well, yesterday was probably the best day of 2003. I went to visit my aunt. She is the wife of my Uncle ( father's brother ) that was killed back in 1991. After my uncle died, we really drifted apart and it was really my fault. I stopped going over there and it was one of the first reported " shutting out "  pieces of my life.   My aunt has been keeping contact with my mother keeping tabs on me. When my mother gave me the number and I put it in the cell, it was just a matter of time before I called. Sure enough, yesterday was the day that made for a re-assuring moment in my life. My immediate family includes my mother, father, aunt, and cousin. It felt awesome to sit in her living room at 11pm and drink her coffee. Her coffee is what made me smile when I was little. I almost cried yesterday talking about Christmas and the good times we had over there. I held in there and kept a level head.   I realize that family is the best thing in the world. Family is what makes ya tick this steady tick.   I went to see her in hopes of finding a reason and confirmation of me wanting to have my own family. When she hugged me, it made me realize things can change. Life is not that bad. I felt how much she loved me. How I thought of how she remembers me being born and my Dad taking me to her house when I was 3 days old and she held me.  This wasn't just a friend of 15 years, she was family.  It felt good.  It felt loving  It was something that has been missing in my life for too long. When my uncle was killed, I really lost it. I didn't care about much nor anybody.   It was this rebel side of me that sought destructive means.  Let's be thankful that all changed.  :)  Be good people  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

Yes, my best friend ( brother ) is getting Married this Saturday. I even took two days off in order to help him and do anything needed for this wedding. I am getting a haircut and everything. OOoooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! yes, I am cutting my hair. I even got new socks for this occasion. My Lenny got me new socks. She rocks.    I will also take this time to say that you will not hear from me until Monday morning. I am taking a blog break. I am slightly overwhelmed over here.  So, until Monday  Take care  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  ok ok ok  I wil leave you with some tidbits..  Why do men have hairy pimply butts, and a girls butt is so pretty? A friend is someone that will bail you out of jail, a true friend will help you hide the body. Girls suck, real women swallow. Lust, love, and crazy freaky = sucking , swallowing, gargling  :-)  Peace

       Unity.......     I write this now in order to get the true feel of it on the blog in the  morning. I was looking through my usual channels at home ( Discovery, Porn, PBS ).  As always PBS proves awesome.   The first documentary that I saw were Latinos in the vietnam war. I won't get  into this because it really upset me.  The second documentary is proving to be a testament to family, loyalty, and  some crazy mexicans.  This is a great story on Mexicans coming form .... uh  .... mexico and working hard to send money back home.   Several Mexican's got together years ago and started a group called " Grupo  Union ". This is a tight group that has brought their Mexican communtiy  together to send money to their home town of " Boqueron ". On the forefront of their  success....   A baseball stadium built for 60 thousand An ambulance for emergenices A basketball court Full kitchen for the school Church was renovated  it makes ya think what can get accomplished if people come together. These  guys probably have done more as illegals in the United States then what I have  seen people born here do.   Porkcops

       ...thinking   Yes, I am in one of those pensive moods that usually means something bad is going to happen. This means that I have been thinking and it usually ends with some nonsense.  Most of the day today, I was thinking about the direction in which I want my life to go. I am not rolling with the punches in " my " life. I believe in throwing punches and making change.  I finally realized where I want my life to go and one aspect of my life is to remain " childless ". I know that children are a gift and all that . Thing is, in order for me to have a child, I feel that marraige should be in order. I want to have my house, my money, my cars, bikes, and 5 years of marriage under my belt. I believe in this because this is what My dad did and I admire that. he has always told me to be ready as much as possible to have kids. He says that you will never be fully ready but be as ready as possible.  I love kids,  yet, I can't see myself with them. I always said.... " not now ", yet, it seems that ' never " is more the reality of it.  Here is my question that I pose to all....... If I dont want to have kids and my significant other does, where do we stand ?"   It is just hard for me to think rationally about this subject when she stares at me directly in the face. There is a blanket of guilt that kinda smacks me in submission here and there.  I don't know,   My little bubble is calling and I think I am crawling into it  Peace

       The best of..........    ............ choppers!!!! Yes, I spent most of my evening glued to the TV watching the Discovery Channel's Labor Day Marathon Chopper series. For all of those that don't know, a chopper is a type of motorcycle. They are custom made to show that rebel side that we all go through.   Anyway, last night was the great biker build off. Where they had the greatest bike designers and builders around the U.S compete. Here in NYC we have a legend named " Indian Larry " that has been building choppers for over 30 years. He whooped this guy from Arizona and I was happy that the home team won. I do have to say this, the guy from arizona built this bike that was " the song of trent lott " of choppers. This thing was " Pearl  candy apple " in color. The neck was out an extra 30 degrees and lowered 4 inches. It was more dragster then chopper.   I have always loved bikes. The crusiers are what makes me all tingly inside. I have always had this dream of owning my own custom bike and just going. NO where in particular, just get on the road and go. Leave everything behind, and search for new memories. I know that it seems far fetched but I do believe in dreams. I also believe that hard work will get you what you want. So a hard working dreamer can't go wrong.   Anyway, life is ok today.   Catch ya soon  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Food, grab bags, poets, white poeple.....   Not in that order but I had a great time last night at a friends house that had a house warming party. They truly lucked out on a beautiful apartment with the train station right downstairs from their building. That's what I am talking about.  I got the balls to make a pernil with the joint effort and supervision of poppa dukes. IT came out really good if I say so. Also, what was the most banging food on a beautiful table, the chicken wings. Oh my god, someone made these chciken wings that I had to get a arm full to bring home. I was going to give them to my mother ( As all Puerto Rican older women wait for food from a party ), those wings are in my stomach as we speak.   Great time, great people. No one got on my nerves. Even after I touched on a tricky subject matter for my next poem that I am thinking about.    I wil pose the question here and you can answer and give it in the guestbook.  I actually am looking for a good answer/ opinion. Uh... Mr Tony Brown, if you are reading this, I actually would love your take on the question. Likewise for Guy  Question: When has killing become morally and ethically wrong???  Could killing ( or a more legal term..... Murder ) be the most pure form of nature's dominance??? Is murder wrong because of the law??? Doesn't that same law Murder ( execute ) hundreds of people a year with the death penalty??  Give me your views people. I want to get a great piece out of this.

       Envision this......   So, I just left Starbucks after purchasing a Chocolate Brownie Frappucino. I was discussing with some execs from the World Trade Organization about world dominance on the shoulders of the impoverished. After my suggestion of clubbing baby seals with the tail fins of rounded up and slaughtered Dolphins, we decided that we don't really need the ozone. So, I went out and brought a life time supply of Hair Net Hair spray to ensure that all my beautiful women have sufficient hairspray. While I hopped into their Hummer H2's that guzzled over 8 gallons of gas per mile, we finally got to the republican breakfast in honor of the National Rifle Association.  With the lobbying of congress to lift the ban on street style assault weapons, the NRA has given a solid case as to why society would be safer with AK-47's, AR-15, HK-91's, and Automatic Street sweeping shotguns back in the hands of law abiding citizens. Most likely, I won't be able to get to lunch today. I have an appointment with the Commissioner of Human services. We are going to determine the best way to dissolve welfare, SSI, Coupons, Homeless services, child care, medicare, medicaid, senior services, home health aide services.       Wow, what is actually amusing is maybe someone out there is actually out there thinking like this. Ewwwwwww.......  Well, I am back at the job life is sucking, I swear, my boss needs to just die.  Going to Rikers today to teach my kiddies.   This is what I call amusing,  I am currently taking the teacher training course from the Community Word Project. I love the course because I am learning so much on how to teach kids and what I call " little people". Thing that is kinda bothering me is that I have three interns coming with me to Rikers to teach. If they think they can apply those techniques that we have learned in the class, wow, surprise time. These dudes at Rikers are not little kids. These are kats that have been through some shit. Some of them are straight up knuckleheads that refuse to do anything. It has taken me 4 weeks to break them down and have them write something. It is not easy and I do not want anyone coming to Rikers and thinking that it is easy. Then, it's for fuckin free. It is time consuming. It can almost break you. Key word: almost . If you let it break you down, life is not going good. I have not left Rikers island not wanting to come back. I have left there feeling rewarded and thinking of new ways to make them write.  I just want everyone to do well.  Anyway, time for me to go.   I started a new endeavor and I will put the link on this page soon. It is hard as fuck but I will try to keep up with it.

       Since sleeping is no longer an option......    I love to do things completely out of the ordinary. Todays out of the ordinary jaunt was..........."Spooketry" in Jamaica Queens. Yes, I came home late and wasn't really in the mood to stay home so I figured that this was going to be my new thing for today.  This was a nice interesting experience to say the least. I have never attended anything that Kool Breeze and RL tha Gifted one have put together. I am trying to keep a certain balance between the guy that loves everybody and the Guy that has a venue to nurture.  Well, let me give you the nice guy recap:  I got to Cheyenne Roadhouse and the place was completely empty. It was supposed to start at 9pm. 9:06pm and it was empty as fuck. I felt like I wasted my 7 dollars. I threw in two dollars into the mega touch machine to kill some time. A nice polite conversation with Kool Breeze about the semi success of Acentos, and like a flood into a bargain sale - the place got packed!! Then, Mr Kool Breeze mentions the buffet in the back. Oh Shit people, free food. Mac and cheese, yellow rice, BBQ wings, Salmon cakes and the whole 9 years. I was happy with my plate and the jump off began.  RL got on the mic and warmed up the crowd with his little jokes and commentary and the festivities sparked off quite nicely.  The open mic was pretty heavy. I went up first, Mad followed me, Extreme Conscious, Zoor, some white chic named Hanna Lynn, and the Dead Possum collective ( Don't ask ). I liked the vibe for the difference that it had compared to other venue's. The place got really packed and I was suprised for about three seconds. They have a good thing going on and I wish them the best.  Now the hater:  There is no way in hell I would ever want Acentos to even be remotely like what I saw today. There was a ligt concentration on poetry and a heavy hand towards " rambling". Rambling in the crowd, mic, audience. It was more so a fiesta with the rowdiest crowd I have ever encountered. Some of the poets were decent but it just wasn't something I could see myself patronizing on a regular basis.  RL was a good host but the mix of comedy, rap, quasi - poetry, just wasn't doing it for me. I had to leave there early  It was too loud, too rowdy, too just not whatI was used to.  Makes me love my series more and more.  I LEARNED WHAT NOT TO DO and sometimes that is the best lesson.  Let me bounce.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       FINE!!!!!!.......   ............. I will write something in more details.  Anyway, Damn, ya folks are really into this blog thing. Oh, for the record, when I hit 10,000 hits, I am deleting this blog. I should be getting there around the new year. That means that with a new year comes "the new newness".  So, I was writing about Starbucks this morning and I decided to go with brevity, behold three e-mails of "Fish, why was it so short" and some sarcasm, I write this entry.  Yesterday I was doing the rare going home With Lenny bit and she wanted to stop off for Ice cream or Starbucks. Well, it was cold so I put my foot down and decided on Starbucks. It was a small redemptive irony involved in going to Starbucks. You see, the last time I was in that Starbucks, I was about $15,000 in the hole after a serious computer glitch did not allow my bills to be paid. I came home on February 14th to an eviction notice taped to my door. I literally almost died of the shock  So, where does Starbucks come to play?? Lenny and I went to That starbucks and I remember specifically talking about that fuckin hole I was in. A piece of me was close to biting a bullet if things didn't get better. Take that as a joke or serious, give it thought. I remember that day drinking some coffee that Lenny paid for and told me that everything was going to be fine. After the thought of removing my existence from this earth was admonished from the head, I thought of my power moves that needed to be done.  So, in going to starbucks last night, I felt as if that was the place to say " HA, I BEAT THESE PROBLEMS AND CAME OFF LIKE A TROOPER!!" That is why Starbucks is the shit.  Has anyone gone to a Starbucks and seen the menu of different coffee's that they currently have for the public. What the fuck happened to those days of getting regular coffee???   Latte, mocha, frap, expresso, double, tall, grande, This , that, that, this.  If you walk into a Starbucks with no knowledge of it, you are going to feel like an asshole.  Walk into a Starbucks and do this.........  Cashier: Welcome to Starbucks, How can I help you? you: Can I have a cup of Coffee please? Cashier; GASP!!!!!!!!!!! You: {Befuddled look on your face} Cashier: Sir, uh, , ummmmm You: What seems to be the problem? Cashier: You want just regular coffee? You: { Somewhat annoyed } YES Cashier: Then get your normal ass to the corner arab in the little portable cart and get your coffee there!!!!!!!!! This is STARBUCKS !! You: Wow, { you walk away shaking your head )  I don't know about this city anymore  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Makes ya wonder......   This morning I start my usual tradition of.......  Buying the paper, waiting for the train, taking my usual seat, face surfing.  You ask what face surfing is???? Well, it's just taking a look at all the faces in the morning on the train and wondering what is going on in their head. Don't get me wrong, I am not staring at these people but I am taking a quick notice. I am the type of person that might not have the slightest clue who you are, but I know plenty about you. I know what time you take the train, your favorite shoes, your favorite coat, how long it takes you to finish that current book you are not quite interested in.   Anyway, Of course, I see some of the pretty women take the train in the morning I wonder about them. This morning, I saw this lady that has been taking the 8:42 D train for the past 6 years. I will call her Shakira. I call her this because the first time I remember seeing her, she had these incredibly long blonde curls. She could actually be the long lost sister of Shakira.  So in the past couple of years, she has gained some weight and hasn't quite dressed as stunning as what she used to. She used to get completely banged out when it came to going to work. Then, slowly, she wore more jeans, sweatshirts, and her hair in a ponytail. Make-up seems to have taken a backseat while her morning rush. Her smile has gotten scarce. The bounce in her walk has turned into a slow slog.  This morning, she gets on the train and it saddened me to see her at the current state she was in.  She had on some old dirty Nike sneakers. Her jeans were old and worn and might not have seen a washing machine for far too long. Her jacket was several sizes too big. Then, I look at her face, I stare. Her eye was blackened from what I only could have imagined was a fist. She hasn't found sleep in who knows how long. The bag under her other eye could attest to that.  I wanted to go over and start a conversation and maybe start a friendship to save her. Then, What could I say???? " I have seen you in the past 6 years and I have noticed that you are going down hill". Most likely after she pulls out her syringe and sticks me with it, I might try to convince her that I am not a stalker.  I couldn't even bury my face into the paper because for some reason, I started getting upset. Upset that something is happening in this girls life that is making her slip away. Something is taking such a toll on her, she is slowly dying. She is slowly wasting away. Let it be drugs, domestic shit, financial shit, family shit...... she is dying right in front of the only eyes from a stranger that just might care.  It is too bad that today we are living in a society where we are so cautious of any and all helping hands.  IF I don't have a white collar around my neck, a police uniform, EMT uniform or even a trusted friend, you will not accept my attentive ear and maybe helping hand. A hand that I have outstretched many  times over the years. In times where people are down and can no longer fall any harder, I have been there.  That has always been my way. Shit, I even lost friends because I was always helping other people. I figured they weren't my friends if they were not acceptive of me helping people.  Over the years, I have gotten cold hearted to many things that I have seen. I used to give a couple of bucks to any homeless person that came to ask me. I used to help people out on a whim. Soemthing clicked in me and I stopped that.  I think that is why Shakira didn't get that friendly hello. That warm smile and the caring " wanna talk ". I feel bad that someone that was once a shining light on my morning commute is now a frail soul with her hopes fading.  Face surfing is dangerous  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Walk a path and look at the perfection called...the world   That is how I feel right now. My little world of poetry is perfect. Tonight, I had an opportunity to host Acentos. How can I explain the the electric feeling running up and down my spine.   Tonight was probably the best Acentos to me personally. The open Mic list was packed with awesome talent. The balance between male and female was right on perfection.  For some reason, I had this comfort level hosting Acentos and it almost felt second nature being up there just doing my thing. I didn't try to do anythng, I just flowed and let the night play itself out.   Then, I had an opportunity to introduce the fascinating ladies of Mahina Movement. If you have ever seen these ladies, you know what I am talking about, if you have never seen them, make a date to catch them.  These ladies are fire, conviction, knowledge, voice and message all rolled into one group.  Being able to see them and interact with them has made my month. I am loving the conclusion of this evening.  My life is good  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Good night last night  I am tired today because of that late night.  So much poetry and 98% of it was decent.   I do have to say this, last nights feature was this dude from Boston named J*me ( Jayme ). He looked liked an angry member from that old TV show the Monkees. His poetry spoke for itself. He came with some poetry from left field that made me go, wow.  He had a really good balance between his reality and his metaphorical craft. Also, he was extremely appreciative of what we do at 13.  So , I have to say that Mr J*me had to be in the top five features that has come through to 13. I will definitely follow this cat. I picked up his chapbook last night and it was definitely worth the 5 dollars. It is a total shame that more people didn't come out to see this cat.  I got home last night and I was tired so I tried to go to sleep but I started a new poem. What sucks is that I am suppose to be editing and perfecting my poetry for my feature but sure enough, I am writing new shit. Don't get it twisted, new work takes priority these days. I was completely inspired last night to write something about my old block. Nothing in general, more detailed of the things that I have seen. This would give you a birds eye view of what is in the head. I might paste on here what I have so far to give you peek.  Well, short blog today because I am tired.   I have some work to do also  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish   Work in progress......  This is not about America This is not about NYC This is about a stretch of 6 blocks in a Bronx neighborhood Where blood finds a path through sewers Stainless steel intrudes abused veins noses pull double duty to breathe thin air and open a path for chemicals that  have traveled through immigrant hands, trucks, warehouses, packing tables, connects, pitchers, Playgrounds are hallways with vigilant mothers keeping watchful eyes Monsters lingering, preying on young regardless of those mothers eyes little girls going to school with bruises, violated bodies, made women before  their Barbie's are even considered to be thrown away

       Why? Seriously. Why?   Hello my little rug dwelling snot picking germ transporters!!!  Ok, Today, I could act a fool. I feel good and I am happy. Yea baby, it's Monday and it is proving to be my favortie day of the week. Do you think it's because of Bar 13 and A little bit LOUDER Monday. I don't care , I like that name better the  that LOUDER Monday shit.   Anyway, I am walking to wrok and I see something that made me think. As everything makes me think, I have to actually write about this one.  We are all subjected to something that we will never be able to avoid. What is this??? You ask this question knowing that I am in this crazy ass mood??? Ok  We all will never be able to avoid Taxes We all will never be able to avoid heartbreak We all will never be able to avoid the aging process  So, let's pick the art of getting old.  Right next door to my building is the Elizabeth Arden boutique. I see every tom/dick/harriet walk in there and walk out looking like two dollars. I would normally say a million bucks but half of these people are over 89 hundred years old. There is not much to be done to a person with make-up when there tits are dragging behind them with the made and butler sweeping up the remnants of blood and skin that has been chafed off.  The ones that kill me are the men. THose men that walk in there and they clearly have gray roots but they walk out with a new head of Black hair. I have seen older men walk in with black and gray roots and walk out with new Brown auburn hair.   Why do men do this???   I understand that A woman will insist on trying to avoid father/ mother time.  Women wear make up, push up bras, wigs, etc..... Oh man, do't even forget the plastic surgery. Why??? Why do women insists on holding on to something that is inevitable. Old age is not bad.  Men age gracefully if I am not mistaken. What do women do??? They just don't age???  Look ladies......get fat, wear huge under garments, Put your hair up in a ponytail. Accept the fact that life is all about getting old. The more you try to hide your age, the more it shows.   For the record, I like OLD OLD CHICS!!!!  LOL   So all you grandmas out there, be careful around me.  Peace, Love, Porkchops.  Fish

          No more writing from the laptop on the lap while watching TV. This entry comes from desktop under the umbrella of total silence.   Preface: I have been writing poetry since the age of about 15. I call it ìbullshitî poetry. I started performing my poetry  in the Winter months of 2002, January to be official about things.  I uppercased featured at Bar 13 on November 25, 2002. I use this date as the official kick off of my writing endeavors. The first Poetry book I ever read was by Jimmy Santiago Baca on November 26, 2002 that was given to me by Marty as my uppercase gift.   Yesterday was another day that threw my whole world into a spin. It was a day that made me think, cry, laugh. Mostly cry for most of my night.   As yesterday was Raymondís day to feature for the Word festival in Lehmanís Lovinger theater, I told Raymond that if he needs anything, to let me know. He took it to heart and he called me at 10:47 AM Saturday morning. As I was half asleep, I told Raymond that I would pick him up at 3:00pm to ensure that he got to Lehman safe, on time, and comfortable. I did this for Raymond because he is one of the very few people that has not gotten on my nerves. Trust me on this one, people have gotten on my nerves. Whomever is reading this and saying ì I havenít gotten on Fishís nervesî, you probably have touched my nerveís the most.  As Mara, Obena ( It is not spelled like that but that is my nickname for her), and Raymond piled into my car, we headed to Lehman with more then enough time to spare. Elizabeth Bassford was already there and as usual, she welcomed us with open arms.   As the instruments, bodies , and nerves were carefully guided to the green room and personal dressing rooms, I was happiest for Ray, Mara, and Obena. Good things happen to good people and this was Karma. Ray deserved this as much as anyone else. I have known Ray to give himself unconditionally to many poets to make their sets go off without a hitch. This was Rayís time. I am glad that the majority of our inner circle was there to support him.   Here is when things tend to get interesting. Elizabeth needed a get a car up to Tarrytown to pick up Robert Bly. I wonít even mention who Robert Bly is because I know that most of you blog stalkers know who this is. Well, at the time of my ride up there to go pick him up, I had no clue. Obena gave me a quick heads up but I still didnít have a feel for who this guy was. All I knew was that Rick Pernod ( Co-founder of exoterica) told me that he talks too much.   After my ride up to Tarrytown ( I made it there in 15 mins). I was going just slightly above the speed limit to give myself some time to get back with Mr Bly. Is 110 breaking the speed limit in NYC?  So I went to the First Marriott hotel and  Mr. Bly was not there. I asked for the other Marriott  and sure enough, he was checked in and off I went. Great thing about knowing the world as then when you antsy, you might meet up with someone that you know from the past and it always feels good. I bumped into a dude from around my way that he married into a rich fucking family. I was happy as fuck that one of my Ghetto brethren has come into some money. His girl was model gorgeous and he has totally lucked out. AnywayÖÖ  Mr Bly comes down from his room after he took his obligatory 25 Diva minutes and I introduced myself as a friend to Elizabeth Bassford and I was there to pick him up.  I opened the car door and he got in and we were off. I saw  Mr Bly and the first thing that came to my mind was ì This old fuck better not die on meî. He survived the ride back at a slower 85 and everything was good.   He give me a run down of most of his books that he has published adnd the translations on some other work. I am like " oh shit ", this is not a bullshit poet. Little by little, I realized that I am with someone that has been doing this for a VERY VERY long time.    Once the bullshit was out of the way, we started talking about poetry and he asked me what I do. I told him about Acentos and what we are trying to do for  our community. I told him about the LouderARTS project and our goal of having writers concentrate on craft and quality. I told him about my life and how I got into poetry. He asked me to recite a poem and I gave him half of my latest father poem. He said nothing at my impromptu performance and I brushed it to the side.  Now, it was his turn to talk. He asked me if I ever slammed my poetry. I mentioned to him that I do slam once in  while to get the excitement of competition into my bloodstream. Then I interjected with, ì Poetry is certainly not all about slammingî.  He then says ì Slam gets tiring after you hear the same angry stuff all the timeî.  First vertebra in my back was broken. Most of my best pieces are my angry pieces. Then, he says ìthat most poetry is meant to be read aloud. Slam just over rides the reading of poetry ì. I start thinking, ì he might not even know Marc Smith but he just  called him an asshole of sorts.î  He proceeds to tell me about a story between him and Cesar Velluja( Forgive my spelling) and Pablo Neruda. Here is a man that knew and worked with Neruda and Velluja. He told me that Cesarís work was genius. He then told me about a certain style of poetry called( forgive me if I kill it) Gazalle. It is a poem in which you only have 36 syllables to say what you want to say. After 36 syllables, you have to change the subject. I was shocked because that is a challenge in of itself. He then says that most American Poets tend to ramble on and on and not give much original thought to what they want to say. Instead of saying something straight to the point, they skirt around it for 7 stanzas before they say it.   He asked me at this point, ìwhere I feel craft could benefit a poem?î. I told him that craft can be another form of originality. Not many poets are willing to tap into the creative elements of their brain and tend to read books to get as good as the poet they are trying to read.  Craft and quality go hand in hand in which the fewest amount of words will convey the strongest view of that particular poem. I think I made an assholle of myself because every time I said something, I would finish it with, ì In my opinion of course ì. I will always be grateful to always have a certain discipline within me to make sure that I have a quality poem.  At this time, we are pulling up to Lehman college and nothing has even remotely changed my life.  We get out of the car and I open his door because his little old ass fingers canít find the handle.    He gets out and tells me that he loved my poem. He wants to get a copy of it. Now, I am giddy. Now, I am a fool. I kept my cool but inside, I was a wreck.   I got in the auditorium and I handed off Robert Bly to Elizabeth and she was estactic. I got him there with time to spare and everything was great. I went into the green room where I had a fly by night conversation with John Hammond and ate some great toasted bred with tomato. I saw Roger, Elana, O, Rich, Maria and a bevy of other people that I knew.  My head was still in another world as I tried to maintain focus for the evening.  With the start of the show, Ray and the SynonymUS crew was first. I am so proud to not only know these people but also call them my friends. Ray was his normal cool amazing self. His shoes were the most rocking pair of shoes I have ever seen him wear. Abena ( I spelled it right to make her happy) was incredible. She had the make up to perfection. Her glitter was put on just right to make her look like an Angel. Mara was an incredible force on stage and her dress made her look one step short of Godly. Mind you, I donít like white girls, but Mara was priceless.  Up next on the program was John Rodriguez. This dude has some poetry that will make your jaw drop. If you are from the Bronx and into Poetry, John Rodriguez is a name that rings, screams, yellsÖ.. I am from the Bronx.   Then John Hammond, This man was an explosion of talent on the stage, He is a blues walking history book. His singing, guitar playing, even a harmonica was intense.   Sadly, I had to leave because I was overwhelmed with my own personal demons that I have to contend with. I think the only thing I could do is my best in this field. I have a lot to learn and that all comes in time.  At least when I was leaving, Elizabeth had a fabulous care package for me that included 5 books and a t-shirt. That made my day perfect.  So, as I am writing to you battling my own little  creative demons. I will promise you this, I will always battle and I will never give up.   Mysteries are not to be solved: If you try, your eye will go blind.*   I will live with my mystery as to why I am a writer and a poet. I wonít solve as to the why, I will work getting better and being respected.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish    * Rumi

      As usual, I am getting my daily dose of Blog. I have never taken any drugs in my life but blogs are truly addictive. So I come across Guy's blog and he is talking about Gun an shit. I am not getting techincal today for the sake of my own sanity. So, my life as a gun Freak will be spelled out in vivid detail today..........  Wow, guns. What can I possible tell you about guns??? I could get all intellectual and tell you how to break down a HK 91 without even breaking a sweat.  I could tell you that the Glock 19 has to be the best gun for a street battle. I could tell you that any gun made by Davis is worth about three bucks.  I could tell you that Smith and Wesson's are priceless on the street. I could also tell you that the most powerful handgun that I ever fired was a Super Python 445 magnum.    Get the point?? I was and probably somewhere in the deep recesses of my body is a gun fanatic. Every since I was young, my father held an interest in projectile weaponry and it seeped over into my genes.  My father owned a mossberg bolt action shotgun ( antique ) and I used to just take it out of the leather case just to touch the butt of it. IT gave me this tingly type of feeling.   The first gun I have ever own was a Raven .25 automatic. It had 5 in a clip ( bullets ) and 1 in the hole ( chamber). That had to be the cheapest gun made to man. The whole pin was exposed inside the chamber. The pin is the piece of metal that hits the bullet that makes it fire. So when the bullet fires the chamber slides back and another bullet is loaded. Uh, with an exposed pin, one jam and the pin breaks and the gun is worthless. Of course, you would think I would learn after 3 pins.   That raven was the first gun that my father ever found in my room when I was living on Elder. I remember walking in and my father hand the gun in his hand. He asked me " What's this ?". I told him, "it's a Gun pa". He wasn't too amused. He just let me do what I wanted to do and said that I would feel the consequences if I ever got caught with a gun.  I always thought that he meant he would try to beat me but that was not the case.  My second gun was an Italian Beretta 92F model deluxe. That gun was the sweetest gun.   My third was a .45 Cal StarFire. It was a compact Combat style 45. It was a bulldog of a gun.   My Fourth Gun was an AMT Hardballer .45 cal competition pistol. This gun was huge and the kick was crazy.   After that, came the Desert Eagle .50 cal. This gun was probably the only gun that ever scared me.   I brought a Mossberg Assault Shotgun with the collapsable stock.   A .22 beretta with the wallet holster. This shit was HOT!!! The holster was an actual wallet  and the gun went right in the middle. If anyone tried to rob me, I would go into my pocket to remove what looked like my wallet and I would hand them a huge surprise ( 6 shots to the face ).   I had the AT-22 Feather target pistol.  I came across a Walter PPK 32 Cal. This gun was the Rolls Royce of the Gun world.   I came across a small 22 Cal. Derringer with two shots that I got into every single club I ever went to. Hint Hint: Grab your chain and put the gun on the chain. Don't put the gun on your chest, place it to your back. The Chain looks like a choker and not many bouncers check that far up your back.  A harrington 22 Cal. 9 shot revolver. This gun was cool because most revolvers come with 6 shots, this one had 9. After 6, you think we are done, whoah , here comes three more.   Finally, my pride and joy, my Glock 20 40 Cal with an extended 40 shot clip and silencer.  I miss that gun. I got caught with it and until this day, I miss that gun like I lost a child.  That is not all of them but the main ones that I remember.  Once things were getting kinda crazy, my life was synonymous with carrying a gun everywhere I went. Where ever you saw me, Fish had a gun. It was common knowledge that from my area, I had the best aim, knowledge, and mechanical skills when dealing with guns. I took it to many levels buying magazines and researching everything about the subject. I used to go to the gun shows and try my best to steal as many guns as possible.  Why not buy??? Fuck that, gun shows are expensive.  Funny thing, I had so many guns in my house and when you are young, you tend to blabber. So, I made up a story that someone broke into my house and stole my guns.  I even broke my window to make it look believable. Could you believe that I had some people come up to me saying they knew who took my shit??? I was pretty amazed at the whole thing.  Guns. Wow. I think that I replaced my love for guns with poetry. That is the only  thing that I could figure out as to why I love poetry soo much.   So, do I own guns now?? Of course I do. Do I have them in my possession ?? heheeehehehe. No. Would I tell you where they are??? Sure, after I am dead. I'll leave you a note.   So much to write but most is incriminating!  LOL  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

        You are Fish The Butcher! You would be famous for chopping up and slaughtering of people in your own grusome way. That would be why the cops would not be able to identify your victims. Cops are on your payroll anyway. You would probably get ideas from slasher movies or previous killers, but turn them into your own thing. You have a creative side to you, which is scary, and you would use it on your victims.

       ONLY in NYC......    Sometimes when I come to work, things are wacky. Today I am getting off the train and I see this dude laying down on the floor. As supine as he cane be with his legs crossed and hands also crossed over belly. This guy was not the usual homeless guy. He was actually rather cleansed looking. I paid it no mind and I just proceeded along my merry way. When I walk up the stairs, to my immediate left, two people laying down on the floor again. This time it was a guy and a girl. My brain then said, "wow, people trying to get out of the cold weather really bad these days". Since I am late, I brush off what I just witnessed and trek the short trek to work. I walk through the Rockefeller promenade and half way through, 3 more people laying down. Nothing to fancy from the way they were doing it, just laying on the floor looking comfy.  Now I know that something has to be up. About thirty feet in front of me, a young lady was giving out pamphlets. I tend to never take these things as they find their way to the nearest garbage can. For some reason, this is the one piece of paper that I decided to grab today.   When I opened it up, it stated "when do you notice the homeless?". Wow, powerful. Then I thought to myself that I notice homeless people all the time. I just don't really give a fuck about them. I know I know, that is cruel. It is true.  IN NYC, there is no way in bloody hell that you HAVE to sleep in a subway. There are resources up the wazoo here that will get you somewhere to sleep.  Different point. Was these people making an artistic statement or activist statement??? What is really the difference?? Aren't artist in one form or the other,  activist? As  a poet, I write about unjust shit and I recite it on the microphone. That is one form of being an activist by opening the eyes of society to what I see is wrong today. Not all poetry is activist related but you hear a good part of it talk about oppression, ghetto, fucked up world, hunger, sadness, rape, killing, drugs, political lamb roasting.   That is a good question, where are we artist or activist? I have steadily noticed that in my search to become a better writer, I have tried to give that back to my community. I have done it in the form of the rikers workshop, Acentos, CWP. In all these projects, I am giving a piece of me back to my community.  Even though I have a long way to go, I do know that my path will lead me to a great promised land. Hmmmm...... where is that?? I don't know but, I do know where I have been. Being there has giving me strength and drive to become the best that I can.  Well, in my search to become a better writer, you will notice that my mistakes are going to be few and far between in my blog, journal, poetry, e-mails. I have been getting very good tips on "strengthening lyrical abilities".   Ok folks,  Time to make believe I am working  p.s I got busted for leaving my job early yesterday, my boss is not happy. As always, I had back up plan B ready.  LOL. I am the man  Peace, Love , Porkchops

       Rikers Chronicle's   Hello people  I am back with another edition of the"Rikers Chronicle's". Today in our column, we will give the detailed witnessing of a woman bringing nature to the Rikers parking lot.  Everything went well today at Rikers and the fellas were very receptive to Piri Thomas ( poet ). We went over the poem "Born anew in the A.M), and they broke it down nicely. The exercise after the class was good also. I now have a roster of 43 students. Don't ask me  where the extra guys that are not even in the program came from, they just sat in and did well.  Anyway, back to business, Riker's is COLD AS FUCK!!! I got there and froze my balls off. I left there and since my balls were frozen off, I now will admit, "women need not worry,I have no penis nor balls to use."  When I got to my car, I stood there after receiving a phonecall. I was chit chatting with my friend and noticed a lady that was walking around her car. I didn't think anything of it. I am chit chatting and the lady goes into her trunk and takes a bag out. Once again, I didn't think anything of it.  Chit , chit , chit, chat , chat, chat. After the lady goes into the backseat she then emerges with the same bag full of this tangent yellow liquid. Oh God, she truly went into the back seat of her car and pissed into the bag. It makes me think, why do I go to Rikers? I see crazier shit every single time I go there.   Next week on the Riker's Chronicle's, join me as I describe an old lady getting gang banged by 4 pipe laying brothers in the bus stop.  Peace, Love, Pork chops  Fish   >)))">

       I am cursed!!!!!    :)  It was one of those nights. I just did not have the capabilities to fall asleep. With the insomnia doing a number on my body, the television and myself bonded lovely.  First order of business, my morning will mostly likely determine how my day will go forth. In saying this, my day should be shitty. Got out of bed and went over to the TV to turn it off. I have a maglight on top of my entertainment center.. A maglight is one of the heaviest and most durable flashlights known to man. I walk over and I somewhat lose my balance and I knock over the maglight. I almost caught it before gravity took hold. This thing weighs about 2 pounds and it smashed into my little pinkie toe. One huge resounding " Fuck" later, I limped around enough to take a shower and come to work. SO I write to you with a huge swollen pinkie toe.  Last night was one of those good nights.  I was watching some TV (Yankees Baby!!) and laid back to enjoy a good night bonding with the boob tube. I was surfing through most of the movie channels and stopped on "showtime".  This movie " The Ring " was on and it was fuckin crazy. It dealt with this VCR tape that was lingering about and death would fall upon anyone that saw the tape within seven days.  On the seventh day, the TV would turn on and it would show that static. Then, a well would appear and this child demon would come out of the TV and kill you. I am not getting too detailed about the movie because it actually freaked me out.   I finished seeing the movie and I am trying to get 40 winks. I usually leave the TV on in sleep mode and in turns off with 30, 40 or 90 minutes from where I set it. I set the TV and close my eyes.  20 minutes later, I hear static on the TV. The Same fuckin static in the movie!!! I know my face was frozen like one of those white chics in a typical slasher flick!  I picked up the remote and turned off the TV. If the TV would have clicked on by itself, I would have shot it with my Mossberg. Fuck that, I am fighting back . I couldn't sleep after that. That movie was good to make me think and add the whole TV debacle and you get FISH WITH NO SLEEP!!!  So, an ode to Poltergeist and the Ring. Fuck ya both  Let me go puff out my afro  Peace, Love, Porkchops

       I like having a nice time   When you are dreading being somewhere for the fear that you will get aggravated, you tend to get stressed. Well, last night, things were so sweet.  I got to Bar 13 to witness a decent turnout. I handed my new flyer to one of the Loder folks to set them up and I just attacked the crowd to give me MONEY!!! After I caught the crowd and I knew it was not going to get more packed,  I was ready to hand door duty down and go concentrate on loudnote taking. I really like that part of the night. I just concentrate on the open mic and keep thinking what I am going to write in vivid detail to give everyone the best feel of the night.   Last night, I have to give kudos to Cheryl Boyce Taylor who is fuckin insane. She read a poem called" Things that Cheryl hates, her rants". She lost her mind. She shouted poets, people, and even me. It was all in fun but I realized that you have to be careful in what you say to people. Her poem was awesome. It even stated " Take a workshop, some of them are free".   The night was good. I slammed last night but got bumped in the second round. I felt good making it to the second round after drawing an early slot and using a brand new piece I never read on the mic. For all you blogger stalkers, the Father in the Barbershop poem got me a 24.8. It is kinda low but for a first draft and not even a feel for the poem, I think it went over well. Of course, I went with the Lares piece in the second round  but the cumalative points didn't let me get to the third round. When the rankings start coming out, I have to make sure I make the semi's. If I have to pull out big guns, I will do so. Until then, I will keep challenging myself to write new material in different styles. The father piece is something that I am really proud of. I had three poets come up to me and hug me to say that I touched them with that piece. That means alot from those craft poets.  I don't think I could read the same pieces over and over again and risk a poet shouting me out in the future. Remember folks, I have a bad temper. :)  Anyway, no res for me last night. I was feeling the white castle and sure enough, 5 burgers, chicken rings, soda, and a huge hunger screaming stomach had me eating like an animal!  Time to make believe I want to go to work.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  >)))">

       .....really not liking the radio    ......simply because of the pandering to drama and bullshit that society thrives on. This morning I have hot 97 on because I have been to lazy to change the station ( This is the only excuse I could foster after not being readily to admit that I enjoy that station). So, not paying much mind to the station after putting on the porno channel, they annouce, " Next up, Poetry ". I am thinking, " oh shit ". Closed the bed, turned off the porn channel. Started checking my e-mail to kill some time. When they introduced the poets, it turns out to be Georgia Me and Poetri from Def Poetry Jam.  I don't know them perosnally but I listened.   I now have realized how much I despise morning show drama. The questions that were asked from these ignorant host made my blood boil. The comments almost made my heart stop.  That ms Info Bitch was saying........   " Spoken word is more of a grunge backpack thing " " Are spoken word artist failed rappers? THey are always trying to flow like rappers" " Would you battle a rapper line for line?"  I was heated, how could anyone ask these questions that have no relevence to anything.  One thing for sure, The poets handled themselves beautifully. They  answered the questions gracefully and failed to get the responses that the morning show wanted. You see, they want drama. They want bullshit. The poets failed to give them that. I was happy for that much.   I have my idea of getting on a radio show. To spread the love and community of poetry is one. Pero cono, these motherfuckers insist on bullshit. They want to know about " Poet Beef ". That shit doesn't give off nothing but negative views on poetry. I am glad that these two Def Poets did n't fall into that.   Well, time to work.  Mucho work.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Running low   I have commited myself to many projects. Community word, Rikers, Acentos, Louder. I have steadily noticed that my tolerance is running low and my patience is even lower.  I am tending to get somewhat confrontational with people who want to shower me with there pompous opinions, unjustifiable justifications, bullshit questions and then some.   Time to get things done for me. As we close out the year in 2003. My next year will begin with new material, projects, endeavors. I need change before I start breaking jaws. THat is the point where I feel I am getting pushed.   Oh, for the record......... From this point on. Anyone, anyone reading this, realize, I can not stand the word "asshole". Do not call me an asshole. I have let some people get away with it and have withheld my anger.  I am sorry, no more of that shit. If you know me, you know I hate being called an asshole. So don't do it and push my buttons. This is not a joke and it is as serious as I can get.  I am not in a good mood today as you can see. I just want to relax and attack Monday with smiles and joy. Until then.........  Peace,  Fish

          Voices for the ..........uh.....Wow   Ok, 190 miles up north off Interstate 91 in a 5 college campus. One college is Amherst College. This is where my hooptie and lead foot led me yesterday.  Guy, Shappy, Ed Garcia were featuring so I decided that this would be a great opportunity to meet new people and see different poetry.  The ride up there was sweet, not much traffic and it was smooth. Ed had his rental car and Guy took his, I took mines just on the general principle that I could do whatever I wanted to do. When we got to the college, we went to a student center and there was a shitload of kids there. This is when the oldness started kicking in. These were college kids and they looked young. I felt really out of place. Yet, they had a pool table off to the side and I couldnít resist. Guy challenge me to a game and that motherfucker beat me. ME!!! The Guy that is ranked a ì9î. I am almost a pro!! He beat me. That is ok, he knows the deal.  After the Spanish food that was in major abundance, we headed to the Keefe campus center to meet up with Shaggy Flores. It was good to see him and have him recognize me and show me mad love. The first question out of his mouth, ì yo, you want to spit ?î. I said that once I get a feel, we see. I kinda wanted Helen to read because the females were really scarce. Ed started pushing for payment of poet servicesî. I honestly didnít care but if a check was to be cut with my name on it, by all means, get me a pen and I will sign. You see, I didnít have a clue how many people were going to be witnessing the 16 poets leave their hearts on stage. I am thinking small reading. 100 people the most. Yea.... uh huh. When I walked into the auditorium, my heart dropped, my balls shrank, my throat locked. I was think, ì fish, what the fuck did you get yourself intoî. I tried to play it cool but about 2 mins before I went on, I thought I was going to die.  First to open the show was Crystal with an Ode to fat chics. I am serious, it was an ode to fat chics.  Taalam Acey was there and he did he thing. I never seen him read and he did well. La Bruja was there and she almost made me change her mind from her performance at the Bowery. She went up there and did the same thing. She bugged out and made the best time of it. Then, she dropped this poem that was crazy, she got a reprieve. Then Giles li got up and killed it, it was also my first time seeing him and he was great.   Queen Sheeba did her thing ad ran the longest in the time zone. Everyone had 12 minutes and she divaíed herself out to 15:49.  She brought the room to this incredibly high bar with her energy.  I was joking, wow, I have to go after her. Her energy is going to make me look like shit. LOL  I got up there and I had 6 minutes so talking wasnít much of an option. I just got up and joked quick with the crowd and went right into it. Oh my God, I channeled this nervous fucking feeling and delivered the best performance of my short spoken word career. I did the Roger at Nationals bit. I wasnít screaming, I worded perfectly. I concentrated on my anunciation. I used every bit of advice from my workshops, team experience, slams, practice. I felt like I was born anew. I loved it. Helen had the other half of the 12 minute slot and she did great. I told her yesterday that she has to be the coolest girl in Poetry.   Shaggy, Bonafide, Kevin Coval, Shappy, Crystal, Dennis,  Guy, Soulfighter  all got on the stage and fuckin killed it.   18 poets and not one  was garbage. Not one bad poem  People, Afterwards, students wanting autographs and signed material had me bugging out. It was lie we were famous and shit.  Under the umbrella of poetry, this trip was awesome.  I got a nice poster with all the poets signing it. E-mails were exchanged and numbers collected. Yep, my mission to Mass was complete.  Acentos flyers were handed out and many Bronx residents that were attending school up there were excited. As Guy said, ì Acentos Represent ì  The night started winding down with some denials of several invitations to parties in rooms and such.  We just wanted to go get some food and we decided to head over to the local pizza place. This is the part where  you might refuse to believe me. This pizza shop was the size of an average pizza shop in NYC. There were a few college kids waiting to get pizza. How many you ask???  At least 500 kids were out there. I am not joking with you, there was a barricade outside the pizza shop not to let the students spill into the streets. I looked at Shappy, ì I am not that ungry dudeî. I know that it is ard to beleive and I am not trying to embellish this story, but, there was about 500 people outside this pizza shope. After that failure to get food, we drove over to a Dennyís where Shaggy, Bruja, Danny Solis, Kevin Coval and myself  sat at a table to talk.  The conversation was mind-bending. We spoke about Poetry, Acentos, Latin anthology to be released at the 2005 nationals, Latin writers alliance, Louis Reyes Rivera talking about Acentos. We touched base on everything and I can see big things happening.   Went back to the room and I was tired. The first thing the hotel clerk was screaming was ìtwo to a room ì , I was like, yea, I walked straight upstairs and got comfy.  Since Guy had to take Shappy to the airport, he was out of the room at 6:30am. Hahahahaha, now you know why I brought my car. I slept in until 10am and it felt good. Guy woke up talking shit that I snore, I never said I didnít . I am a man, I SNORE CARAJO!!!! Helen didnít mind my snoring, plus, I am sick, bit me.   I have to give credit to all them kats up there that made this event possible and a success. I got alot of good ideas. Mostly, what not to do to make things run smooth. Shaggy is somewhat of brash in his ways but his certainly has a good heart with incredible ideas. It was definitely worth it and my Poetic resume now says, ì featured reader at Voices for the voicelessî.  Life is good with good people  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       seafood and pool   Can I explain to you how much I love seafood!!! Last night, Eric came to my house to pick e up to go shoot some pool. The night of shooting pool quickly turned into , " Let's go get something to eat". Even though my stomach was full after eating a hearty meal at my mother's house, I could never tuen down food. Fish turning down food is like Fish turning down a blowjob, it just can't happen. Gay men, please do not apply after that last statement.    So Eric, Tom, Mike and myself headed to Seafood city in City Island and we comepletely made fools of ourselves eating WAY too much. I had friend clam strips, garlic bread, and 6 baked clams. You can hear my hormones acting a fool right now. Listen closely........... " I need some" !!!!  Anyhow, Eric had a shrimp and chicken franchese. Tom had shrimp parmesian. Mike has shrimps stuffed with crab meat. We all picked off each other and completely enjoyed that awe struck feeling of, " I just ate too much but I don't care, I am happy ".   It was great to see Tom and Mike and hang with them. We haven't all hung out for quite a while. Eric has been working and we just figured that after the wedding, he would have more time. That was wrong in so many ways.  I don't really write much about Tom and Mike but these two are a novel in the making. Tom and I used to work together at the Club in Norwalk. He was a bouncer and he needed an extra guy and that is when he called me up. I worked there for about 19 months. It was interesting to put it lightly. Tom and I used to go to the GYM together and work out like animals. We sparred with each other. We got pretty tight actually. THen, he got on my nerves . We are still cool but sometimes it is good to keep people at a distance. Tom is kinda like a rabid racoon. He will bite ya if you corner him, other then that, he is cool from a distance.   Mike on the other hand is more the normal one. He is the medic with a penchant for swords and everything violent.  Don't get it wrong, they are both violent but Mike is more my type of violence.   As for these two, they are tight as brothers should be. Tom gets on my nerves sometimes but I just tend to ignore him.    Not much to balbber about today.  Tomorrow, I am off to Mass. to Voice of the Voiceless.   Wow, I am driving three hours for a poetry reading, I have no life.  peace, Love, Will take offers for ...... Well, Not really.  LOL   Peace   FIsh  >)))">

       You find inspiration in the weirdest places    Today, coming home from Rikers, there was this lady with her little two year old son acting a fool. Behind them was a lady that was playing with the little kid. After the lady got tired of playing with him, she kinda wanted to stop, the kid didn't. She tried the silent treatment but he kept on. She tried to just play the "sleeping" role to ween away his attention. The kid winded up this swing and smacked the shit out of the lady. I couldn't even laugh because I was shocked. The lady got up and the mother's excuse for her kids action was " well, you shouldn't have been playing with him". Me personally, I would have smacked the mother just for having a fucking SAVAGE FOR A CHILD.  Anyway, I started thinking about the times when I was a kid and I spent oodles of time with my dad. So, this was brn today. It is different from my usual tirades. Give me feedback........  untitled  Every Month, my father and I  walked three blocks up 183rd  street to the Grand Concourse  to our favorite barbershop.  Since my recollection function  in my brain began, my Dad   always had his hair cut  in the same fashion, Primp the side Shape the back of the neck, leave some in the front When I was six, we took a walk  up those same blocks on  a breezy fall day to engage  in our monthly bonding moment  My dadís barber wasnít there that  day but with some convincing  from the quartet of Hair aficianados,  the stubborn man known as Dad was  convinced. The new barber that was a virgin to  the land known as ìDadís hairî told my father î you are going to get the best haircut that money could buyî  The chair was prepped and my old man sat. The absurdly brand new angel  white smock was wrapped around  his flabby neck.  The skinny black comb was  lost in his greasy  and even   darker shade of black hair.  My fatherís neatly combed hair  that has not seen the other side  of his head was going into foreign territory. As he called it, ìthe dreded pushbackî.  With the comb being followed  by steady slow strokes to maintain conformity, the barberís eager caress of my  fatherís hair reminded me of my mother. The sly strokes that pampered  my fathers locks while watching  the evening news  The scissors clipped against each  blade and made that sound that  only a barberís brand new silver scissors can. In between the barberís middle  and fore fingers was dadís hair  waiting to be clipped.  As the hair fell from the soft cut,  they landed on the floor like the  stress removed from dadís    8am to 8pm factory shift  The comb eases through dad's new  "push back" style to reveal a  shiny scar over his right eye.  His face was round,  his eyes were brighter,  his smile matched his new found coolness.  The blade that I feared so much  after taking a piece out of my  skin was ready to  bring perfection  to my dadís new follicle statement.   The water bottle sprit careful  streams to moisten his skin. Under the flourescent  barbershop lights , he had a glow to him.  He doesn't budge  and the shaping was magic.  Above his ear,  across his forehead,  the back of his neck Without a blink,  the hair blower clicked on, and a new comb,  with finer teeth,   eased back my dads hair.  Slow even strokes followed by that  barberís steady hand made him anew.  The talcom powder was applied  with a large soft bristled brush and the angel white smock was off. He looks different His hairstyle changed,  his side cut was now the full blown D.A.  My Fathers walked with a bop that cold breezy afternoon  We walked back down those three blocks  on 183rd as the ego lasted for one day, about as long as the new hair style That day, he was cool and that barber shop glow  never left him Dad was Just Dad   My first father poem people!!!!!!!!!  LOL  Time to sleepy sleep  Peace, Love, PorkChops

       A serene lake's mirror image is shattered by the winds of.....    ...........yea, circumstance is the only word that I feel can fit in there. Today is a day in which I will shy away from craft, quality, and even sense.  I have been thinking about this taboo subject for about 2 weeks. The only viable explanation for this feeling that I have is........ "love is a motherfucker". Yep, that is what is going through my mind. If you give it, your fucked, if you don't your fucked. There is no winning happy medium when it comes to love and all related to it. People, I have seen love come and go in my life much more then the normal relationship having peon in urban NYC. I have always thought that I have sincerely loved others in my "ready to crack" relationships. Then, I have come to terms with something that I have always run away from. I don't think I have ever loved. I don't think I have ever truly sat down and given love the true time it deserves. I have felt when it comes to relationships but I don't think any of it could be considered a tangible form of "unconditional love".   IF I write down what love can be.........  Unconditional Sacrificing bliss moving emotional secure   If I go down this list. I don't think I have ever done any of these in the two relationships where I have declared my love for someone. I have felt this undying need to say it when it is said to me but, was I really at that state of mind?  I am willing to make someone feel good. I am willing to give them a good time. I could be attentive, caring, affectionate. Mostly, that is where it stops. I have never been willing to sacrifice too much of myself to make something work. It is so much easier to sacrifice the relationship and let time heal your wounds. I have taken chances with the hope that the bacitracin of time will heal me. I think one day, I won't heal. I will continue to hurt until that one day that I no longer feel anything.    I have this witty ability to with hold my love from the fear of getting hurt. I don't jump into anything to deep without knowing that it is worth it. The question remains, How and when do I know it is worth it?  I have had three women tell me that they love me. One was a pure unadulterated bitch. The other was just a depressed mental case. The last, she was just her.  How I treated them??? I treated the Bitch like if she was my world. I gave her the breathe that she breathed. The mental case, I gave her all of me. I gave her my heart, mind, and money. The last, I held back. I wanted to make sure it was worth it. I wanted to take my time and make sure that falling in love was the right thing to do.  How do I know it's the right thing?? I don't know that answer and that is what cost me. Am I hurting??? Yea, In losing, I always hurt.  Last night was Acentos and it was the best one we have had that was not a special occasion or powerhouse feature. I had to do the emergency hosting because my partner could not get there at the 7:49pm start time. In that happening, looking out into the audience and realizing that I had to sacrifice my support, it hurt me. I lost my staple, my drive, my backbone in everything good.   No tears, but sadness No wondering, but sacrifice No regrets, but.....  I'm sorry  Peace, Love, Blessings  Fish

       Good Morning   It is one of those days. Not much to say. Actually, I have shitloads but I will keep those loads in me for mere reasons that many of you will never understand.   I just wanted to say good Morning, afternoon and have a great day.  Also,   My lovely lovely fellow poet has a Birthday and you all should take out a moment to wish her an incredibly warm Happy Birthday.  "Vanessa, Happy Birthday Girl, I send you a kiss and a hug and I will see you soon"  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Community Word Poject training  Day 2    Please be warned, this is going to be a long ass post. I Have time to kill here at home and I want to get as much of this feeling out on the blog.  Well, the day went well. Today was the day taht all our presentations were due. As the un-fearing, stoic animal that I am, I volunteered to go first. As being the sacrificial presenter of our assignment, if I did my wrong and anyone did something similar to mines, at least they can change theirs around to get something correct. Alas, all was good. I had Keito, Diane, and Sugar as my pet projects and everything in the presentation went well. I was very happy with the outcome and it was "tight". The best part of about today was seeing at least 17 people give their views and perspectives on what was their " creative elements". I learned from so many people sharing an intriguing intropective view from their artistic dicipline.  I had the best time with certain exercises that I had to take part in. I think my favorite one was with a oung lady that is a story teller and visual artist. We had an exericise that we had a group of three with two artist and a model. Simone and myself were the artist and Sugar was the model. We had to get two adjective to describe what sugar was feeling and use the props that were provided. Simone and I brainstormed until we finally got something that we agreed on. Sugar looked out the window and he was really pensive. Then, with a long shaul type thing, we put it over his shoulders. We then grabbed a scarf and wrapped it in a head dress. I taped it and it looked like an african king tribal head dress. With Sugar looking out the window, it was awesome the community and reward of the exercise. I had to say that was my favorite one.   The most beautiful presentation of the night was by Bushra. She is of palestinian decent and she dropped some spiritual bombs. She started in Arabic and then said a story about her Grandfather. Then she segued into a butterfly presentation and passed out cut out butter flies with quotes from Rumie. Oh my god, she killed it.   Tai dropped a great interactive piece with music in the background.  Claudia did her presentation and had us walking around the complex like little chics.  Diane Roy had a great presentation where she stripped her clothes off and used that metaphor as removing layers.  Keito did a great emotional piece that I was digging.  I think that everyone today did great. Some people took this exercise as a challenge and delved into deep personal areas of their lives. They shared those moments wth is that made them vulnerable and accessable as human beings. The emotions in some people's presentations were sincere and made you rip small scars in your heart.   This program is proving to be worth my time and energy. In giving them 100%, I am dead tired. So , in interest in keeping my sanity, I will stay home tonight and work on a new piece that I thought of today. Roger, Marty, I love ya but I am staying home with my computer and thoughts.  On that note, it's time for me to run and start my rest period.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

       Solid night.......   ........... said the fat puerto Rican man. She Tonight was the first ever Acentos troupe going to blue stockings book store to feature under the umbrella of "Soul Nation". The bookstore itself was actually really cool. Alot of books ( duh ).  They were also selling several really cool t-shirts but I was too broke to even think about buying one. The night was pretty nice with the opening of a short film by a young lady named "e-fierce". I think the title was "Corporate Dawgs". It was funny to look at. Then a young "out of the closet" lesbian went up and sang some really nice songs. You all know that I am not too keen on mixing different styles of arts, for some reason, this worked and it didn't aggravate me. She sang three songs and made her way stage left. Then, up next were the Acentos Poets,  I was a little ticked over my biography because it made no mention of me cofounding or even being involved with Acentos. Since I wrote it and submitted it, It was my fault anyway.  No biggie, I brushed that shit off when I was called and did my thing.  the vibe in the room was awesome. I read two new pieces and an old piece and got great rev's after the set.  One girl that teaches in the Bronx asked me to come down and read some poetry for her students. Can anyone say " that is an in ?". So, I sent er my schedule for when I am free and we will take it from there accordingly. When she gets back to me, I will figure out if it will be just me or other poets in tow. I would prefer other poets to come down.  Not even a day after I read, I got this e-mail *************** E-mail **********  Hey Fish,  I saw you at Bluestockings just a few hours ago and I just wanted to say  that I was really blown away by your passion and poetry. You have an  amazingly powerful voice that I think would benefit my students to here-as  it did me. Would you be interested in giving a small reading for my fourth  graders, and maybe lead them in their own journey of self-expression through  words!?!  I look forward to seeing you on Third Avenue soon!   Thanks, Emily  *************************************************  See, life is good after all  Time to go  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Supressed but rewarding   Yesterday was the radio show on WBAI 99.5 FM called Perspectives with Louis Reyes Rivera.  We trekked into the radio station and we were all suprisingly calm.  Guy was rock solid as his normal Met's loving self. Ed was very smooth. Oscar was great for all those years in listening to Opie and Anthony. Rich Was good. I was there just for the ride. I flubbed some lines but that is just me. I have to start talking slower. I think things and my mouth can't catch up. I think the best part about yesterday was Louis giving us the best comments about what we are doing up at Acentos. He said some things that truely had to give us some points. All in all, we read our poetry. We interviewed slightly and read more poetry. The experience was new and also very rewarding. Just being there because of all the hard work that we have done is one of those side benefits of busting our ass. I got some e-mails from a few listeners.   One said: You sounded like urkel. (  I am going to kick her ) Another said: Fish, you are my nigger but you sounded gay ( I have an ax handle with his name on it.  Besides that, it was good for the resume. As we were the guest, we technically featured. So, another feature spot goes on the resume. yeah baby.  Last night I headed to Urbana ( Bowery Poetry Club ) to catch Daphne again and get into the slam. I am kinda stressed out so I figure that a slam would help nicely. Sure enough, I did ok. I read my I am off parole piece and made it to the second round. I got up there and dropped headlines and killed em. Dawn and George killed them more. I didn't make it to the 3rd round. That is ok, I  got my respect. Rich and Oscar both slammed, they both read well. I am feeling good about slamming this year. I have some strong pieces and they seem full of potential.  I will slam next Monday at Bar 13 and make sure that I at least get some rank.   WEll, I am off to go teach at Rikers. It should be a good day today. I am performing tonight at Blue Stockings for Soul Nation. Also, I am going to try and hit the Nuyo to see Manny do the spotlight.   Other then that, life is just OK. You all know, when it is ok, it should be better.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       If I listen closely..........   I can hear Guy over where he lives laughing at the last three outs in the Boston- Yankee game. Bottom of the ninth and Guy has that deep belly laugh thing going on. I respect him so I won't really say what I want. Anybody else, don't push the buttons.  The Yankees were really sucking today. I just got home and it is 5 - 2 Boston. Giambi pops up and it is still 2 balls and 2 strikes. I can actually see Boston Fans in Yankee  stadium. Oh God.......... the pitch........ Ball 3. Full count. Another pitch........ Caught him looking with the 3-2 slider. I swear to the all mighty dollar, they are truly fucking suckin right now. I want to write about the mazing time that I had with my Man Eric tonight, but I can't tear myself away from this TV. Now the Puerto Rican wet Sock known as Bernie Williams is up. Oh fuck, hits to first, 2 up, 2 out. One more out and the fucking Yankee's go home losers for the night.  You know what, fuck the 26 previous championships, ya need to get one for 2003. I am not tring to hear that the Yankees are the best in history. History can kiss my ass. Ok, Jorge Posada, another Puerto Rican sock. Ok ok ok 2 balls, 2 strikes. Let's see what he does. The pitcher winds up, he throws... Full count. 3 balls, 2 strikes, no men on base. COME on WET SOCK!!! The 3-2 pitch,  he swings, foul. He is still alive. Wet sock, wet sock, wet sock, wet sock, wet sock. The pitch, caught him lookin. Swing carajo. Be a man!!!!!!!  Boston wins. I have a radio interview with Guy tomorrow at 2pm, I am taking my brass knuckles.  Anyway, today was a good day. Nothing to brag about at work but afterwards, things started looking up.  I had some official duties at Mindbuilders and it entailed me picking up some electronic keyboards. I solicted the help of Mr Rich Villar and he brought his truck down and we stuffed it to the brim and off we went. Got to Mindbuilders and spoke with Oscar and Rich about some good ol Acentos business.  I love the way we can pow wow and always be on the same page.   Anyway, the best part of my evening you ask? I got to hang with my brother Eric. I haven't hung out with him since who knows when. He has been working 15 jobs and barely has time to think. So today, we played pool. Yes folks, I got back on the pool table and dusted off the semi-professional skills and brought it. For all you poetry folks, pool was the perrenial favorite amongst the vial heathens that I call my boys. Pool started after I broke up with my demon spawn hell raiser ecuadorian slop bucket of an ex-girlfriend. Does that sound bitter?? I was going for petty but bitter will suffice. At the same time, Eric was going through a break-up with an ex of his. Thursday was just getting together and just letting out the built up steam from during the week. It was Wil ( dickboy), Eric ( E ), and myself. We started going every thursday and it became the place for all of us to meet up. Before you know it, Thursday was offically guys pool night. I remember when John, Oscar, Jay, Keith, Jordan, and a miriad of other schmucks came to the pool hall to put their skills on the table. After whopping all their collectives butts, not many returned. After Dickboy fucked up like the royal asshole that he is, it was just Eric and myself. We played pool until our fingers hurt, backs cramped, legs swelled. We ran games like poets create haikus. One after another, we just kept on. To get the upperhand, we used to go the day before to practice. When one found out, we would go two days before and even the weekend. So I practiced six days to get ready for Thursday. We were all alway hellbent on beating each other to the ground. My best day of pool was when I beat dickboy 9 straight games to his 0. He was not happy.  We got pretty good. I played in several semi-pro leagues at amsterdam billiards and got rated a 9. 10 is pro in the pool world. I could have kept with it but the cards didn't fall that way. Pool was always just to relax and get my nerves back in order.  I weened away from pool tournaments and the straight up hustle.  Being good at pool is scary. You can consider yourself good when you tell people that you are not. If you brag how good you are, you probably suck.  I was always used as the " tool " in bets placed at after hours clubs years back.  They got their best pool player and bet 100 a ball left on the table.  So if I beat their best player and I leave him with 6 balls on the table, I got 600 bucks coming to me. There was an after hours on third avenue that this dude was known to be the best player all over. Him and I broke even that night. He was good but he was just a shooter and didn't quite grasp setting up the next shot. I also say, those small bar tables are not pool tables, those are practice mats for bigger games. A shark in a bar sucks at a pool hall. A shark at a pool hall is unstoppable at a bar table.   I truly went off the beaten path.   Well, Just playing pool with my nigga and finding some normalcy in my life. I felt good today.  I ate popeye's chicken, saw my nigga, played pool. Now, If I could only fall in love, life would be perfect.  Let me run'  time to bounce  Peace, Love, PorkChops

       ........annoying things   You ever had one of those things that everything annoys you? Just waking up and looking at the picture on your wall that has been there 10 years and it just annoyed you. Phone rings, you are annoyed. E-mails opened, you are annoyed. Buy the paper from the same little Arabic man from the past 9 years and the way he looks just annoyed you.   Well, welcome to how I feel today. Welcome to the world that if you call me today, you will annoy me. Last night, I was home thinking over some things about my life and trying to work on this presentation. The thinking over took my presentation and the aggravation kicked in. A friend of mines called me last night and she was the unlucky recipient of some spontaneous ranting. The advice was solid but the situation is still extremely precarious. I am in a place where I want plenty for me. In other words, I am shying away from being selfless. Time to do for me and me and me and me. Does this mean that I can give 100% to anything besides me? I don't know. Does this mean that I could love? I don't know. Does this mean that my life is confusing? That i know.  " In search of " is defined "to sacrifice" in my morbid book of definitions. That is the way it feels to me. My life is going to sacrifice plenty to propel me to that plateau of success.   Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Stick your tongue in the air and taste it......   Taste the air for life, taste the air for love, taste the air since you actually woke up to taste the air.  Life is good to me. I woke up this morning with a drive to do everything righteous. I was tooo chipper for some people yesterday so I toned it down. Inside, I was screaming. I wanted to stop every person in the street and shake them by their shoulders and scream "I am off parole"!!!!  Ahhh, yesterday was my vacation. I didn't do anything. I decided that I wanted to enjoy my first day of total freedom. I chose to just sit and enjoy everything about night from poetry to reflection. Most of the night, I wasn't there. I was somewhere else thinking about my wrongs. I know I know, don't give that much thought. Well, I have to. Everything in my life revolves through right and wrong. IF I choose not to think about the wrongs, what will stop me from making those mistakes again? Everyone knows that we all have made mistakes. Most of mines have been doozies.  From the bullshit that we went through High school up to my neighborhood.  80% of my high education was hanging outside with a group of the most amazing motherfuckers.  My block wasn't that far behind. The guys I grew up with had there idea of "love". The love was to beat the shit out of anybody that crossed you. As weird as that was, you knew that they would do anything for you. Of course, this was vice versa. I miss the love and good times. I miss growing up and just going to the corner and meeting up with " the fellas". Somewhere, it all went south when the drugs, shootings, and killings began.  I know that life would have been so much better if drugs didn't come into the mix. If money was more readily available through employment. I am not talking about 5 bucks an hour. I am talking about a good job that pays all the bills. Unfortunately, that would require an education and half of my dawgs barely passed 8th grade.   I am not lucky. I am not blessed. I don't care for those terms that relay justification for my outcome in life.  I do work hard and this is for me and my people's. This is for my community. This is for my dawgs.   I miss my boys  Freddy, Tony, Mark, Kevin, Steve, Harry, pupi, Jorge, Tico, Baby Angel, Little Wil,  On the real, ya niggas are in my heart. That is why I write. Ya motherfuckers need to put ya spirits in my pen and let me know what you want to say. If not, I will see ya soon enough. W have some catching up to do  Rest in Peace  Peace, Love, PorkChops  Fish

       Freeeeeeeeeeeddddddddoooommm!!!!!    Dudes,  I am done. No more reporting to bullshit parole. No more non-sense. No more problems, aggravation, heartache, hard -times, fights, misery! Nothing. I am sooooooooooo done!  They checked to see if I paid my fines and all and they gave me my send off. I wrote this poem for the  occasion.  Fish and finishing Parole  She sat stoic in the steel chair that screams fear every morning she walks in Her hair was in the  ì15 years on the jobî  ponytail with plastic glasses that overcame her  round wrinkled face She smelled of Ben gay but reaked of animosity, anger, and she was just plain fed up. Our conversation went like this.....  As smug as she can be she says,ì Ok, you are done, Good-bye ì I return the volley with sarcasmì Thatís it? ì ìyesî   No balloons? "No",  marching bands? "no"  a deployment of helicopters in a victory formation  Nothing? No "Thank you" for 5 years of upstanding NYC citizenship while on my conditional release? No congratulations for not strafing the law.......again.?  " Vargas" No no no....  It is now, Mr Vargas.  You were happy taking my urine over and over again until that one day I filled it to the rim and you were like ìwhatís that ?î,  uh. just like you wanted,  nice and warm to boot  You were intent on seeing me fail, seeing me get upset, seeing me admit to MY crime. You were there to ask me stupid questions. 	ì Have you been arrested again ? ì  	ì well, you would find out anyway so why make YOUR job Easier?î You were hoping to violate me with the use vague threats 	ì If you are late I will violate you ì 	ì If you miss a day, I will violate you ì 	ì If you breathe, eat, shit, or think a criminal thought, I will violate you ì You pushed me to the proverbial edge of what little sanity I had left You treated me like a criminal 	Ok, It wasnít too far off from the truth but........ Guess what??? I want to scream in your ear to make you listen I did it, I admit it  I placed my forefinger around the un-reasoning  of my glock to hear 17 explosions of uncertainty and I took my own life Every one said " the scum of society, a criminal",  Any other wonderful terms of endearment you would like to call me?" How about " another young latino lost from the lack of Direction "? I quickly became nothing A cyst on the skin of society  I built blocks of resentment I labeled them My anger My hopelessness My Regret   All these have ignited fire in my heart an endless bastion of 3rd degree determination " Here is what I want to Scream "  I put up my finger in a sign of defiance.  only one finger stands but if a young brotha makes a ì mistake ì, I will hand it to him  Together you will have two showing you what we think two fingers will be four Four will be eight Eight will multiply TO AN ARMY   In Teasing me, boding me,  tempting me Fuck your five years  I have life My students at Rikers I have my cars I have my job A mother and father that love me  My Brother Eric, Oscar, and even a friend that I call Dickboy A girl that gives me the world My friends who stood by me in those 5 years 4 years 3 years and those pompous egotistical heathens that I call poets are now my FAMILY and I have my love of life  in which THAT ... You will never take away She still sat stoic in the steel chair, unnerved, un moved,  I added another "1 minute" of anger to her job that she despised She adjusted her " 15 years on the job Ponytail " she just said "Good-bye"    Fish  Peace, Love, Porkchops

       Tiger attacks and homework    Ok, When I turned on the news and I hear that the NYPD had to subdue and remove a full grown tiger, this means that I have seen it all. This dude in a NYC 5 room apartment had a full grown Bengal Siberian tiger in his apartment.  That thing was pushing at least 400 lbs. The tiger attacked the owner and he goes to the hospital and say that his pitbull did it, the doctors were hip that the injuries were not "pitbull related", they called authorities and the guy bounced. At the same time, the tiger was pissing so much that the urine was seeping through the floor to the apartment below. Her complaint was " I have tiger urne coming through my ceiling".  If I was on the other side receiving that call, of course I am going to brush some crazy old lady.  So we have tigers in NYC, what 's next?  Yesterday was my first day at the community word project teacher training program. I was ther half dead after I went to 120 wall street instead of the designated 120 Broadway. I know, I'm a moron. The class was incredible. I have a new found respect for Michelle and Lisa. we did some great exercises and they brought the whole class tgether as a community. I won't ruin the gossip that will be born Monday night. I'll let you in on a little secret, I was an image sculpture of a butterfly. I was the most ghetto butterfly that you probably have ever seen.  So, we learned many things yesterday about Multiple intellgiences and creative elements. I have an assignment due next saturday that I have to figure my creative elements. I have to get together A TEN MINUTE presentation using the multiple intelligences. I was thinking of a game show type of presentation with three volunteers. As of now, out of 8 we have to come up with, I think the following can be my creative elements:  environment experience risks commitment dedication craft energy  If anyone has input, drop it in the guestbook.   So, my day is done. Long day today   Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

       Weird Dreams   Yea, I know, It is too early to be up at this time on a Saturday. Well, I have things to do so bite me. Ewww, I'm cranky. I can't even think how cranky I will be tonight. LOL  Last night I had the weirdest dream. I would love to know where these dreams come from. The dream consisted of most of the poetry people that I knew. We were all sitting around a huge table. On one side, everyone had these blue t-shirts with " this is what we believe in" written across the front. There had to be about 11 poets with these shirts. then, everyone was standing around them and they refuse to talk. They were just sitting there and didn't want to hear anything, talk about anything, nothing. They seemed rather stubborn. I got the impression that they wanted to do it "their" way and that 's it.  It was just a weird dream. I don't like looking into my dreams that much but if I did on this one, I would probably depress myself. So, with that being said, I am off to CWP.  Peace, love, porkchops.  Fish  >)))">

       Beautiful day.........   Oh man,  I feel good today. As I hauled my big round ass to Rikers Island, I was content with today's calls. I had to deal with beureaucratic  bullshit but The class made up for it. Today, I actually exhibited control of the class. I have these three dudes that were insisting on talking and bullshitting. They were paying attention but wandering off into "Talk shit space". So te main thing that I tried to tell all of them is that respect is the key element of my class. So thye kept yip yapping and I had to pull their card. So, with a couple of well places words, they chilled and realized that I am not there to play around. Shit, I volunteer my time and these motherfuckers think I am going to waste it when I go there, fuck that. Like me or not, you are going to listen. Best part of today, the kid that "Wasn't feeling the class" came back this week and started writing. I now have 39 students that are all writing and listening. I had one kid that was trying to fall asleep but my "tension relief" exercise would even keep dead people awake. Another great part of today, we had an extra 15 minutes and one of the fellas got up and asked if he could "spit" a piece. This gentleman is a muslim with a great interest in the class. He recites a pretty decent poem. THe fellas started jabbing me to do one "like that". So, three pieces each later. The imprompty show was over and we both got a resounding applause.  Last week, I asked for respect, today, I earned it.    Good day, good life.  Tomorrow, I start Community Word Project. I am going to become a certified teaching artist  Yeah baby  Peace, Love, Pork chops  Fish

       Fish's word to live by (the re-mix)   Accept that some days you're the toilet that catches, or what falls into the toilet  Always keep your words soft and sweet, just in case you have to eat them.  Always read good poetry that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.  Drive carefully. It's not only cars that can be recalled by their maker. Then again, if the cars are recalled, that doesn't make the maker of those cars all that great does it?  Eat a raw penis in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of the day. This applies to all males, that are straight.  If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.  If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.  It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to others. "Don't be like him"  Never buy a car you can't push. Don't push yourself to buy a car you can't afford. Dumbass  Never put both feet in your mouth at the same time, because then you don 't have a leg to stand on. Just make sure you haven't walked in a field of shit before putting the feet in the mouth.  Nobody cares if you can't dance well. So go home.  The early worm gets eaten by the bird, so sleep late, watch porn, sleep more  When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane. Turn around and go with it and be the "bad times" for the guy behind you.  Birthdays are good for you; the more you have, the longer you live. Also, you get laid more  Ever notice that the people who are late are often much jollier than the people who have to wait for them? So when they  get there, smack the jolly guy and you would both be upset.  If ignorance is bliss, why aren't more people happy?  You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person. SO do as you please.  Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once. Having sex with your girl when the recorder is on. Heehee  Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened. Then do her in the butt again!  We could learn a lot from crayons some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, some have weird names, and all are different colors but they all have to learn to live in the same box. Until the litle kids melt them all on radiators  A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour. Unless he is lost and cursing at everybody. "Hey buddy, how do I get out of this shithole town?"  Happiness comes through doors you didn't even know you left open. Not in the Bronx. I have three locks on my door. A 12 gauge mossberg shotgub, a bat, and one mean chihuahua!

       Why do I love it sooo???   No, not porn. I am talking about Rikers. I am talking about Acentos. I am talking about the louderARTS project. I am talking about the newly formed latin writers alliance that will be annouced soon.   Rich told me something the other day that struck such a cord with me and has even stopped me in my tracks.   Rich" Dude, you are so selfless that it comes down to a time that you have to do for yourself. T You have to think what you have to do in your life to better you "  Man, I almost cried when I realized that the majority of my life has been helping others help themselves.  When there is a project to be done and you need help, call Fish. I will be there with my sleeves rolled up fired up with such a conviction that you will be amazed. I jumped into Louder, Acentos, Rikers, Community Word, LWA.  Without a thought, I am there to further a cause and do what I can for the literary field.  What have I done for me?  I have gotten some small opportunities here and there but where have you heard me do for me? Wow, almost rare that I will say that I am doing ANYTHING for me. My life has gone so well in 2003. Nothing bad has happened but I am quickly questioning what were my achivements " personally ". Forgive me for ranting but right now, I am kinda weird in the emotions department.  I should be happy but for all the hard work that I have done this year, I need more.  I deserve more!!!   Is being selfless a fault for me? Is being me just not good enough?  I just feel weird.  Peace

       Redemption   Well, Last night was Willie Perdomo doing his poetic wordly gymnastics at the Blue Ox Bar.So, back to poetry on the blog! It was a packed house last night. It wasn't the most packed I have ever seen it but it had a number of people. Leslie was typical leslie in hosting but she is getting better, slowly, but she is getting better. She has some serious connects with the BCA, I can't even explain to you everything that she has done for us. We have gotten gigs, jobs, references.   Last night it was the louderARTS open mic. As Rich, Raymond, Oscar, Edward Garcia, and Myself read on the open mic. So you know it was a solid night. Oscar, Rich and I all read new pieces to a good mixed review. I was happy as a pig in shit when Willie Perdomo told me that he was feeling my "poem".  REDEMPTION after making a fool out of myself at Morgie's cafe about a year ago.  The night was good. Ate a pizza that was kind of nasty actually. Stay away from the pepperoni pizza.  We still got to plug the shit out of Acentos.We got good leads on some poets. You have to talk tothe poets to get them to come read.  I am home entering this blog because my job is going to be crazy and I am not going to have time to think today. So, I will bid you farewell and hope that everything is going well.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  >)))">

       Just ten blocks   Figure it out from what I am talking about. Anyway, yesterday was a significant drug seizure in the Bronx. 850 pounds of pure cocaine, $500, 000, two guns, 5 people arrested. Somewhere out there, somebody is pissed. What would they be pissed about??? The drugs, money, guns? 850 pounds of coke is not a pretty penny that you want to lose to anybody. The seizure was said to have an estimated street value of $ 11 million. Of course, cops don't know shit. Let's try more in neighborhood of $27 mil. If it was for the cooking of crack, triple that.  Once the coke gets to NYC, it is pure. They have to cut it down ( step on it ) and mix it with baking soda to give it quantity but you are taking away from the quality.  Take a walk to the local grocery store and tell me why they have such a HUGE stock of baking soda, makes ya wonder. Baking soda was never that great a seller until crack came to play.   Like I was saying, 5 guys were arrested. Two drivers that came up from Mexico. Three people here. They are basically fucked. The drivers might get away if they agreed to a " Non-disclosure " contract. In other words, "I went to pick up this truck and I drove it to NYC and dropped it off.  I had no clue what I was dropping off". That is the case about 90% of the time. Drivers never have a clue what they are driving, delivering, picking up etc.  The three guys in the warehouse have issues thought. Don't even think they are getting bail. 1 kilo can get you 25 years if you are found guilty of trying to distribute it. You can't say it was for personal consumption, there is no way in hell you can take 1 kilo just for your little nostrils.  So, wish them luck, for they are fucked (That is the poet in me).  Peace, love, porkchops  Fish

So I donít know If I am sick or I am fighting a flu or a hard case of Ebola. Just in case..........  Here is my last Will in testament:  I hereby leave the following:  Diane Roy gets my porno collection ( Just videotapes ) Rich Gets my furniture for his new Apartment Eric gets my Playboys Roger gets my Poetry Books Guy gets my 27 inch TV Sony trinitron Lenny gets my snowglobe collection and Pictures Eric F gets my james Dean pics  Parents get the rest  uuuuuuuhhhhhhhh......

      Turkey is good but Shrimp ceviche is better. Oh man, regardless of me being sick like a dog, I trekked to Ericís house to celebrate a little bit of Thanksgiving over there. I walk in and there is food on the table, food on the stove, food by the sink, food everywhere. Once Oscar told me his mother made shrimp ceviche, that was my first plate with some white rice.  Oh man, I have been upset for a couple of days but that sure put a smile on my face.  I am home today with no plans on leaving my house. It is raining, you know Fish hates the Rain. If I ever went to your house and it was raining, it is all out of love.  So, the sandwiches will be plenty today. Italian bread and turkey people!  be good  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Why am I an animal??  heehee  Today was a Thanksgiving feast in my job. Everyone in the company brought a meal to share. We set a table in the mailroom and the food was in abundance. Turkey, chicken, ham, roast pork, Mac and cheese, potato salad, macaroni salad, cakes, cookies, pies, and arroz con damn near everything really. I ate like such a fool and the toilet Godís were loving my delivery.  After work today, the research department in my company put together the first impromptu ìTurkey Bowlî. 22 guys got together and headed to Central Park. After finding out that Central Park is full of shit, we found a nice spot to engage in a testosterone filled nonsense of men getting WAY TOO CLOSE!!!   Can I tell you that these guys were not ready for me.? They were about as good a poet at a Rap concert. It just didnít work!!  I couldnít bare myself being on the field as these dudes attempted, rather poorly, to play the game that I love so much.   So, it goes like this.......  three interceptions one touchdown 4 for 4 receptions several deep passes blocked  As they thought the fat puerto Rican man couldnít run, seems that going deep wasnít an option evertime I was all over their play!  heehee  I love football  I love poetry more

      overwhelmed, sad, emotional,  redemption, love.  I feel an array of emotions going through this body.   Tonight was Acentos and it was memorable. How can I even start? Where can I start? what to say, what to say...........  I have been working for a long time in trying to make this the next step in my poetic endeavors. This feature was my ìmake or breakî. I think I made it the next level in my writing and I feel good.   The night went great and Guy was an incredible and gracious host and he alone stands as Best in my book. The open mic was solid and I am loving everything in my life right now.  Just being a poet and performing at this level in front of my closest family and friends is priceless.  I wish I could sit here and explain every detail but that takes time. Right now, I donít have time.  :)  Peace  Big crazy love to my dawgs and partners Rich and Oscar for making Acentos great.  The personal thanks are forthcoming  also the personal "go to hells"

      I have done everything possible within my power to make things work tonight. I am tired, excited, nervous. For some reason I feel like using the word "redemption" to describe how I am feeling. Yet, it is the proper context alluding me at this moment  that I am trying to figure out.  Tonight is the night and my blog is going back to the personal journal that it was supposed to be. I used this thing to market Acentos a tad too much.  I feel good today. Already cried this morning when I looked back at how good my life is. I am so happy to be doing something that I love with friends that appreciate my every step. With tears rolling burning a path down my cheeks, the salty taste on my tongue makes  it worth it.  That salt signifies conviction and love all rolled into one.  I have conviction playing football, playing pool, paintball. IT was something that I was good at but never loved. Today, I can say that I am doing something for the love of the art.  People go to museums to admire art.  The art I love are the words put down on paper. Abstract words that are intelligiently put together to give you detailed images. Poetry, writing, reading is my art.  I paint pictures with the words that escape my pen. I hold back thoughts until  uneven, undefined, unwanted words in my head completes vivid wants. I want to write and now I am learning how.  Life is good  See you all tonight  Peace, Love, Poetry  Fish

      Give Taylor Mali the assist on this blog entry.  Cultivate friendships with opposites I was once a card carrying member of the ACLU and the NRA at the same time. I maintain cordial relationships with several misguided individuals who I wish would wake up and start seeing things MY WAY. "Reasonable men and women will differ," my father used to say, "and if you don't know anybody who thinks different, then you're not doing you're part." Go ahead and have your heated discussions, construct and attack each other's arguments, mirror, reason, articulate, and rebut. Then have a toast. Off to a poetry reading tonight, wishing all well.   I never gave this much thought. I always think if a person rubs me the wrong way, I don't deal with them. Why should I ??? You make your bullshit points and intend for me to believe you on your bullshit??? Well, why is it bullshit? Why do I feel that way? Hmmmm......   Time to start building. Maybe not in a direction to replace a failed friendship, but to build a constructive and amicable relationship where "agreeing to disagree" can be possible without me wanting to break a jaw. It takes time.  DON'T FORGET TOMORROW!!!!!!! IT"S ON!!!!!

       The best news that I have heard this week, maybe even the month, shit, I will be bold and say that this is the best news I have head this whole year.  My buddy from Florida found out that his lovely wife is pregnant. I am soo happy for him. His wife was a reservist and has been serving since the start of this mid-east debacle in Iraq. She comes home for rest and relaxation and she gets pregnant. Viva la Sperm!!!  In my most inner circle, Eric has Noel and now Jose will have a baby.. Life is good when you hear news that puts a smile on your face.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

            For Immediate Release November 3, 2003  Contact: Erika Wood, Legal Action Center, (212) 243-1313 Kele Williams, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, (212) 992-8637  Juan Cartagena, Community Service Society, (212) 614-5462   VOTING RIGHTS VICTORY SECURED THROUGHOUT NEW YORK STATE  People with Past Felony Convictions Will No Longer Face Barriers to Registration   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New York, New York ñ November 3, 2003 ñ Just before Election Day, the New York State Board of Elections has put an end to widespread local practices that disenfranchised thousands of citizens with felony records who should have been eligible to vote, three advocacy groups who negotiated the agreement announced today.    On October 29th, the State Board, acting in response to an investigation and advocacy campaign mounted by the Legal Action Center, together with the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and the Community Service Society, directed all county boards of elections to remove a host of barriers that had prevented people with past felony convictions from registering to vote.   State law automatically restores these citizens' right to vote once they have served their maximum sentence or been discharged from parole, but an investigation by the advocacy groups found many impermissible road blocks erected by local boards that prevented voter registration.   More than half of New York's 62 county boards of elections, including all five boroughs in New York City, have been refusing to register individuals with felony records until they provided various documents. In many cases, the required documents do not even exist. Others are not available to some former felons or are only issued after a lengthy waiting period.   After the Legal Action Center, the Brennan Center for Justice and the Community Service Society brought the problem to the Board of Elections' attention, it and various state criminal justice agencies agreed to sit down with the advocacy groups and work to remove the barriers. The newly announced State Board of Elections policy resulting from the groupsí victorious advocacy campaign instructs county boards to register people with felony records the same as they would any other eligible voter ñ by accepting a completed registration application with the signed voter affidavit. The Board's policy explains, "everyone who presents themselves to register, completes the form and signs the affidavit, is presumed to be eligible and should be registered. A person [with] a felony conviction is entitled to the same presumption of eligibility."   Erika Wood, the Legal Action Center attorney who spearheaded the advocatesí campaign, hailed the new policy for ìrestoring an essential civil right to people who have paid their debt to society and are fully entitled by law to exercise their most fundamental right ñ the right to vote. We applaud the Board of Elections and the other state agencies for their willingness to find a constructive solution to the problem.î Juan Cartagena, general counsel for the Community Service Society, commended the Board of Elections for recognizing that "all citizens registering to vote should be counted as equals, regardless of their criminal histories. The idea that everyone's vote is equal forms the very foundation of our democracy."   Under the policy, county boards who have questions about the eligibility of a person with a past felony conviction may consult the Department of Correctional Services' website which will confirm the dates individuals completed their sentences or were discharged from parole. ìThe state government has the information it needs to determine voter eligibility. Under the new policy, they will use it, rather than force individuals to chase down documents that may be impossible to collect,î said Kele Williams, associate counsel for the Brennan Center.   The Legal Action Center is a nonprofit law and policy organization that specializes in issues relating to the rights of those with criminal records, HIV/AIDS or addiction histories. The Community Service Society is an independent, nonprofit organization that serves the poor through, among other things, litigation in numerous voting rights cases. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law develops and implements a nonpartisan agenda of scholarship, public education, and legal action that promotes equality and human dignity, while safeguarding fundamental freedoms.

       Pobre Langston   Last year at Rikers, Oscar decided to give the fellas "Theme for English Class B" as a piece where the fellas can write and attempt to find their own distinctive voice. The class was feeling Langston Hughes like a colonoscopy with no KY on a cold table for a reality TV show. Oscar discreetly asked me to take over after he realized he had no control. I got up and the C.O walked in. For some reason, an inmate on another part of rikers fell onto some dudes knife several times and died. We were escorted of the island and went amongst out daily duties.  Well, yesterday I once again tried to introduce Langston and the class wasn't feeling it. It was about as constructive as watching a porno with no erection. Claudia was my sidekick and she also tried but the class was having the holiday blues. I truly had to leave the lesson plan and go with the them of te moment. It was a little awkward but we made due with what we had.  This class is proving a little bit more difficult then the last one. Seems that they were sold a dream of computers and culinary arts and were never told of Poetry. That makes it a little difficult trying to teach people how to write when all they want to do is fiddle with PC's all day.   I am still going in there with my other 3 lackies (Claudia, Keito, Diane) and we are going to give everything we can. It is not up to us to take what we give. All we have is the option of giving all of us to some people that want to (or not) take what we give.  Peace, Love, Porkchops and poetry   Fish

       Why do I do these things.....   Sometimes I wonder why I do things?  Last night was an event called ì CHANTING DOWN THE WALLSî. It was suppose to be an event concentrating on how  society can break down the injustices in the judicial and penal system.  The event started ok with some poets and after that I felt it went to shit.  The poets kept to the theme ( most of them anyway ) and dropped poems about prison or something close to it.  After the spoken word, an ex black panther from the Bronx, Dhoruba Bin Wahad was the key note speaker. I have never attended an event like this and was rather amped expecting a speech that would change my life. My life is still the same and it is sad to have wasted my time.  The speaker delivered an empassioned speech. Plenty of content but he lacked any defined foundation to what he was trying to say. People, I know that African-Americans have been oppressed. I know 1 out of every 6 people incarcerated is African American. I know most of the facts and sad realities that I have been a part of.  What is going to be done to change this??? I am not going to attend more events where people are saying the same shit over and over again. I want to attend an event where they want people to help change injustices as to where we live.  Do you think I want to just talk and not do???? That is why I am Teaching at Rikers for free. This is why I am doing the Fortune workshop for free. This is why I am teaching at some public schools for free.  The bigger picture is getting to the people to prove to them that life is theirs for the taking.  Giving them a taste of what can be done if they apply just a pinch of their potential. I donít want to talk about bringing down the system and creating change within it. You have to create change from within. Do you think I go to Rikers and teach them poetry for two hours plus?? I tell them about life and what they can do NOT to come back. This is where I feel that I am breaking down the system from within. If you have 39 inmates and none of them come back, you have successfully taken a small piece of that system and turned it to shit.  The biggest picture is going back to your old neighborhood where all your boys are hanging out.  I have no qualms telling my version of the crazy bunch that I worry about them. I love them, I want them to live a long time. I want them make an attempt to better themselves through whatever legal means to get their asses off the streets. Change starts somewhere right????  Yep, inside of yourself is where change will make the biggest difference. After you make that change and you know yourself, that change will permeate into the world and make a difference.  My version of the crazy bunch will be at my Feature on November 25, 2003. I saw them last night and 2 hours of laughing and talking poetry. I got something from them last night that I only got though the use of my fist, I earned their respect.  I have always had their support, but I was the ì bitchass poetî. After last night in telling them I was teaching, learning, writing about what we all have been through, I earned accolades, love, respect.  I am not a scholar, I am not an individual with a Masters, I am not a genius. I am a man with a conviction in something that I love. I love poetry, Life, change.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  >)))î>

       step back and wonder.............   When I was little, going to Puerto Rico was the official summer vacation for every small Puerto Rican Child. I was shipped off with a supply of clothing for two months. One month was with the maternal Granny. The other month was with the Paternal Grandparents. I used to love the paternal Grandparents so much because they gave me the run of the proud Vargas acre. One acre of chickens, goats, and an array of vegatables.  In the Summer on 1976, My grandfather was taking me on the morning chores of the farm. I would always help feeding the chickens, goats and 5 or 6 pigs he had in a special cage. He grabbed this one pig and he tied it to a tree and told me to feed and wash this pig every morning. For 3 weeks, I washed and fed this pig special food for him only. I even gave him the name, ì piggyî.  On the start of the 4th week, early in the morning, my Grandfather ask me to go get piggy and bring him to the front porch. Piggy trusted me and he would never scream when I tied him up. I bring piggy to the porch and tied him where grandpops told me too.   I see my Grandfather with a huge two by four in his hands. He lifts it up above his head and he lays it directly across the head and back of piggy. The pig was screaming and wailing! My Grandfather hit him again and the blood came out of his mouth. I moved back and was wondering what was happening. He hit him again and the screaming morphed to a childlike cry.   My grandfather and his son, my father, pick up piggy and put him on the wooden table on the side of the house. The water that was to a boil on the side of the house had a purpose. I was told to stay away from the water because it was hot and they needed it for something. I never would have known it was for shaving the hair off of piggy. Once on the table, my grandfather slit piggy throat with a machete. He opened him all the way down to the bottom of his legs. The wooden table had a huge metal bucket on the side. The table had a drainage pipe contraption and all the blood seeped into the pail.   When piggy was opened up, his inside were a pale color and had a slimy look to them. My grandfather scooped everything out of him and threw it into the bucket.  More hot water and the sharpest machete I have ever seen and piggy was a bright white. The same place where they were boiling up the water had these two huge cinder blocks with a wooden stick  laying across it.  My grandfather shoved the stick down the mouth of piggy and it went straight through him. Grandfather and father both picked up the pick and they put him over the hot coals.   For about 6 hours, my Grandfather stood there turning piggy slowly. He turned a really nice brown.  My father helped my grandmother use the insides of piggyís intestines and fill them up with piggyís blood. They put them in a big pot and let the intestineís boil until they turned brown.  About 7 hours later, my grandfather said that piggy was done and they put him on the huge table in the back of the house. They cut piggyís head off and cut him up in little pieces. Everyone from around the house came and drank and ate what was Piggy.  How did I feel? At the age of 5 years old. I experienced something that no one in this life would ever experience.  My grandfather asked me ì que tu te cres que paso aqui ?î( What do you think about what happened here?). I told him,  you killed our dinner and it was good. Can we do another one tomorrow???? He laughed so hard. He said next year, he will let me cut the throat. I was looking forward to it.   My Grandfather died in March 17, 1977. I never got to kill a pig with him. He knew that his little Grandson was willing to do what he has passed down from his generation.   Over the years, my Grandmother let me kill chickens, rabbits, and a couple of pigeons here and there. I never got to kill the pig that I looked forward to with my father and Grandfather. Three generations of Vargas men bonding over the hard work of ìbringing the dinner homeî   In summation, I was five years old and killing didnít bother me. I have to share this with a therapist      Peace, Love, Poetry and porkchops  Fish  NOVEMBER 25, 2003 ACENTOS 139 & 3rd AVE BLUE OX BAR  FEATURED POET: FISH  Fiesta BABY!!!!

       Sleep, bed,snoring....   This should be the ingredients for what is coming in the next 45 mins, yet, I am here writing this...........  This will probably be my most personal entry on this blog to date. It will be in two parts...........  I want to write whats on my mind and get into more details tomorrow.  right now................  -     I am scared of being a failure after I have gotten some respect -     I was questioning if I was really a poet  -     I can't give Lenny the love she wants but I can't have her out of my life -     What is love? -     I have been in a funk for almost three weeks and I am finally coming out of it, why was I in a funk -     Who are my true friends? Who do I trust? -     I wish things never change for the worst. I want to go back to unconditional happiness before the bullshit -     My tolerance is low    -     Why do I relate better to people that I barely know?-      -     Why am I considering giving everything up in search of something else? -     I haven't beaten someone in a while, why do I miss that?

      I live amongst fuckin savages!!!  Ok, if you are commuting to work and you treasure that 45 minute ride to work, how would you feel if some dude hocks and spits a huge piece of his lung right on the train floor in front of everybody??????  This is not a way to start a Monday!   I was reading this article yesterday that got me really pissed. The article dealt withSouth Bronx tours for some of these white people that come to NYC. I was pissed but then I was confused.  I felt like a circus animal caged in the borough (zoo) called the Bronx. I was hating it. Then , this morning, this motherfucker hocks his inner workings onto the train floor like if he was in the playground. I lives amongst savages!!!  I wanted to say something so fuckin bad. Yet, I stood shut. I got up, walked to the next car and grabbed a seat. Several people followed suit after me. I can't understand why people do things sometimes.  I will write something more constructive after my mood goes to higher ground.  Peace, Love, Poetry and porkchops  Fish

      So,  I was thinking about commitments and friendships and I am in a comedic mood today. Here is what I think can give you a detailed view of relationships in NYC.  First off, we have Friends to the spirited commitment of MARRIAGE. Wooooh.....that word is soo sexy. Any way, let me create a small table for you to understand everything that is in between. 0	single- everything you do remains private.  1	Friends ñ people who know each other and just chill 2	Affectionate friends ñ people that hug when they see each other 3	Very affectionate friend ñ people that tap kiss on the lips but it means almost nothing 4	Friends with benefits ñ People that make out usually during drunken stupors. 5	Friends with special benefits ñ People that you hang with that you tend to trade bodily fluids with on any given night. We used to call them booty calls. 6	Open dating ñ People who go out but with each other but still go out with each other but have an understanding that they are not the ìoneî 7	Dating ñ Not commited but you are not fucking anybody else neither 8	Openly commited ñ I am with you but you can be with whomever you want, you bring them home and we share. This applies to bi-sexual women mostly 9	Committed ñ Girlfriend and boyfriend and you not fucking no one else but you can still socialize with the oppsite sex. 10	Engagement ñ right before marriage and it makes no sense to be at this stage if you want to be with anyone else 11	  12	Marriage -  You say I do, and you will not ìdoîanyone else besides the one you are currently doing.  Thought I was done??  hahahahah!!!!!!!!!!! NO!!!!!!!!  13	open marriage ñ You are married but you can go and bring anyone home to share in the bedroom activities 14	swinging marriage ñ you are married and you attend parties together in search of other couples to engage in deviant sexual behavior 15	Porno marriage ñ you can only have sex at work and you can bring work home but you canít have sex outside of the home that doesnít deal with work. 16	Survivor marriage ñ No matter how many time you get caught, your marriage stay in tact  These are mainly the levels of relationships in this crazy ass world.   Question: Where do you fall?   Peace, love, porkchops  Fish  NOVEMBER 25 PEOPLE!!!!!! BLUE OX BAR!!! ACENTOS 139 & 3rd AVE 7:00PM  FEATURING FISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       every beginning must have an end...........     That explains my 3 stroke limit when I am having sex.  " Wait honey, I can't find it.  POKE!!!  OW!! Opps, sorry.  In, oooooohhhh.....stroke, stroke, stroke........... DONE!!!!!  So that is ...two in's and an out Ahhhhhhhhhh, gotta love that blow-up doll.    How we doing today folks.?  I hope that you are all doing well. I am doing pretty good today. Woke up in a good mood after a night of hot sex. Yea folks, I gots laid!!! Then realized those vividly explicit dreams can really trick ya.  I HATE THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL!!! Well, Not really.  Yesterday was a good day. Got my fat porky ass to Rikers Island to do the teaching thing. I got to the parking lot to an ì instructorlessî bus hub. Diane, Kieto,  and Claudia were to come with me yesterday to teach as part of the  Community Word Project (CWP). After I rounded up my lackies and made in onto the island with no problems, we were off to the teaching races.  I am not going to get into every detail about what happened but just generalize as much as I can. Plus, itís hard writing over the moans and groans of this midget porno they are giving. WOW.  I gave the fellas ( my class ) Aristotle by Billy Collins to read yesterday. This poem is a great way to give the fellas a structure on how to write a poem with a beginning, middle, end. It shows them plenty of different perspectives of what can be viewed as a beginning middle, or end. HOLY SHIT, The MIDGET SPEAKS SPANISH!! She just turned me on.  Since Diane was my sidekick for the evening and Keito and Claudia were somewhat benched, Diane took the class and did her thing. She spoke a little bit too much because I want them to write more then talk. She still did well. Yesterday, we segued Nostradamus, power of words, perception of words and individualistic meanings of those words, Metaphors and the power to master resemblance....... etc. Alot of information for the fellas and they were completely receptive to the idea of having 4 instructors. It was not chaos as to some people thought. It was actually perfect.   After we read the poem, I broke the class up into three groups and gave them each a certain exercise. The first group had to write about the beginning of anything and keep the detailed imagery to just that. The other group had the middle, the last group had the end.  Designated was Claudia to the beginning group, Kieto to the middle, Diane to the End. So here we are in Rikers Island with the class broken up in 3 groups in true workshop format. I stood back and just watched the instructors each apply their unique style of assisting, supporting, routing the fellas to write a poem of their respective group.   To throw them a curve ball, I had the instructors of each group read the pieces that their group came up with and my goal was achieved. The guys all wrote great pieces and they understood as to what is a beginning, middle, end.  At the end of class, I put the instructors on the spot by having them give an impromptu performance for the fellas. When I did this, I got their respect much quicker and they listened more. So, to get this out of the way, they performed and the class gave them all resounding ì10ísî across the board.   Diane , Keito, and Claudia did very well yesterday. I didnít see a nervous bone in their body and they kept their poise solid.  At least I know for the next 10 weeks, I will have three great instructors heading to Rikers to teach and show the fellas love, respect, and poetry. I was as happy like a fat man at a steakhouse.

      Since my day yesterday was rather private. I was looking for a decent subject matter to write about today. In all my blog stalking, I have read about politics, personal junctures, law, death, and being a vegan. I will write about the last one.  There are two people in my life that I know that stick to anything besides meat. One is ìmy favorite whiteboyî MC, the other is my best female friend (that I owe a kick in the ass too) Aileen. Aileen just became a vegetarian about 7 years ago when she just started thinking about all the bad shit that meat does to you. I wonít get into facts and details because MC already did that on his Blog, so check him out.  I never questioned her stance on it. I just went with the flow and respected her decision. The best thing about it was that she never tried to instill her beliefs on me. She wasnít screaming over my plate how bad meat is for me. That is he reason why I respected her.   In life, everyone makes a lifestyle choice. They make these decisions based on whatever they feel is best for them. They also have to reap the consequences of that decision. It is plainly blatant to see that vegetarians do live healthier lives then us carnivores.   If you want to believe that eating 5 pounds of steak in one sitting is healthy, believe that on your hospital bed with your cholesterol hitting heavenly levels ( I mean that in altitude ).   Every year for my Birthday. I usually get together all the fellas and we head to my favorite steakhouse, Peter Lugers. I love to eat steak. I always had this undying love for a good piece of cow meat slapped on my plate. Thing is, over the years, you can tell that my body is sayingî yo, my man, you canít eat that shit foreverî. Well, in trying to be health conscious, I left many fried foods behind. I am trying to eat less. Steaks are proving to be hard to let go.   So this year, I might think of something different then steak. Why??? Simple, change starts somewhere. So this year, we eat seafood.  January 7th is my Birthday and I hope that all my blog stalkers come out to where I will hold my birthday. I will plan it soon.  On a Birthday noteÖÖ. Give the Third traveling member of the Acentos Trio a shout out for his Birthday.  urlLink RICH VILLAR has hit that yearly milestone that some of us celebrate by crying, dancing, eating, fucking. My birthday will be spent eating. That is all a single man can do.  Peace, Love, PORKCHOPS BABY!!!!

       ....if it's an angel, so be it   Last  night was one of those moments where you thank whatever religious diety that you worship.  To get straight to the point, I was on the highway last night coming home from a late night jaunt with a good friend of mines. I was on the Stretch right before you hit the Whitestone bridge ( by the College Point Movie Theater ) and a construction project was in full effect. I am driving along going about 50 to 60 and the three cars in front of me completely just stopped in the middle of the highway. There were two lanes available and I was in the right lane. I slowed down but I have this habit of always looking behind me because that is where it always comes from. I see this car and the headlights are not slowing down. I looked to my right and I saw that the only thing stopping me from going into that lane was a small orange cone. I decided to floor it and shift into that lane. The car behind me never even hit the brakes. He missed my car and the explosion in front of me was horrible.  He rear ended a Taxi cab and both cars were totaled. My heart just slowed down this morning. I got out of the car and I was heated that it "could have" been me. then I realized, It wasn't so why get upset. Those two dudes have much more to worry about then I.   Why did the cars stop in the middle of the highway??? The construction guy put up a sign that said "stop" instead of slow. By the mistake of this young asshole construction dweeb, two cars were destroyed.   I wanted to stick around but I chose not too. My car wasn't touched and the guy that rammed the Taxi wasn't in good shape ( no seatbelt ). When I peeked into his car, you can tell that his face met head-on with his windshield. He didn't look so good with an incredible amount of blood on his face. The arab from the Taxi cab got out of his car and fell to the ground. He might have hurt his back really bad.   The rain, an asshole construction worker, unexpectant variables on the highway- all were perfect for another NYC highway tragedy.   I am not lucky, I am vigilant  Life is extra good today, I am home with the next two days off  Call me at home if anyone wants to talk.  Peace, Love, and I pray to my Porkchop goddess!!

       Tip toe through a mine field.....    Ever since I was a sperm swimming around pops testicle's, I have always been fascinated by the evening news. Instead of coming home and watching all the pitiful piece of shit cartoons, I was looking forward to the 6pm news. Back in the day, the dynamic dueling dynamo's of the evening news were  urlLink Roger Grimsby and  urlLink Bill Beutel . These two were my perennial favorites. I always thought they were going to be on the news forever.   So, to keep my fetish of watching the evening news at the forefront, I still catch the 6pm evening news. I never gave the anchors much thought. My mother was always playing fashionista and saying things about their clothing to their make-up.   As of late, I have garnered this particular crush for an anchor and I can't believe this shit. 30 some odd years of watching the news and I never paid them mind. Until now!!   I watch the news and  urlLink Liz Cho  is hands down beautiful. I look at her and I can't concentrate on the news. She delivers the news and I don't care about the world because I am looking at her. Yesterday my mother broke my heart when she said that she looks pregnant. I was like NAHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhh.  Google Liz Cho and she is married. Listen closely to my heart wasting away.  nah seriously, she is making my days of watching the news a pleasure. It's like.......  Roz Abrams says: 50 children died in a school fire today Fish: OH MY GOD, THAT IS HORRIBLE!  Liz Cho: A meteor is hurling towards earth and we all are going to die in 5 minutes Fish: That is not so bad, wow, she is so hot  I have to catch the channel 4 news at 11pm in order to really get a feel of the news, anything with her, news takes a back seat.  Oh well, I am finding normalcy people, life seems to be getting better  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  Note: If any of my lawyer folks caught offense for my post yesterday. My bad

       Hate me or love me, you will listen....   so , a piece of me is as sensitive as a porcupine walking through a cactus patch on a 110 degree day. If you missed it, too bad.   I just walked through the door and I am catching the First episode of ì 8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughterî. This is the first episode done after the death of John Ritter. I wasnít planning on seeing it ñ I guess I am.  Seeing this episode trying to meld through the more then sufficient ìheart ripping ì moments, I canít do nothing but wonder the purpose of life. I wonít get into that.  I will get into this episode. Minus the laugh track ( or live audience ), the jokes are few and far between. They are placed somewhere between the garbage and the eye muck you wake up with in the morning.   I have never gave funerals much thought until watching this episode. Where can they find enough writing material to fill up about 45 mins? There are only so many people that will come up to you and say ì I am sorryî in a funeral. You ever wonder what they are so sorry about???   -	I am so sorry that you are alone now? -	I am so sorry he died? -	I am so sorry that you had to go through this? -	I am so sorry that you are feeling this way? -	I am so sorry that he died that way ?  I could keep on forever.  I am lucky enough to still have my mother and father here and they are both primarily healthy. So I donít have to worry about my parents leaving for about another 15 years. My mother is 67 so I am giving her another 20 years here. My father is 57 and I am giving him about another 20. I should be old enough and hopefully strong enough to deal with it. Then again, you will never be ready to bury your parents, spouse, or FORBID a child.   I lost my uncle back in 1990 when he was caught between some rival drug dealing assholes shooting at each other. That is was the closest that I felt this pain ripping my heart out. I have lost friends to the point that I am immune; but family is a different pain altogether.   Death is a part of life. Yea yea yea, we have to deal with it when it comes. Whether it be our family, friends, co-workers or whomever. Every time someone passes, you feel a different pain for every person that passes away. Most of the time, I think of how I would react to the news of someoneís death.   Hands down, my parents leave me anytime soon, I would shut down and try to accept my life without the people who are my backbone.   Not to sound like a person that would jinx or curse anyone, but if anyone from my inner circle was to pass on, I wouldnít quite be the same.  Oh well  Good episode I think. We all know that he really died, does this make it more palpable on an emotional level??? I donít know. I do know that the frog in my throat was saying there was a connection between the emotions conveyed by the actors and a very rare sensitive side of me.  I am off to the races to catch a 10:45pm super sneak peak of the Matrix III: revolutions. Donít hate the player, hate the game.  Peace, Love, Donít be dying  Fish

       Did you see........    ......... the older gentleman that was rather miffed at his lawyers fee for services rendered? Instead of confronting his lawyer and talking about those fee's, the older gentleman pulled out a 38 caliber 6 shot revolver. The lawyer played " I'm standing behind the tree and you can't get me" after the old man shot at him 6 times. He got to hit the lawyer twice.  Why am I bring this up??? For all of you that have seen it, you saw what a gun shot victim can do. None of that, I got shot and I am on the ground writhing in pain". The adrenaline was flowing and even after the lawyer was shot twice, he still managed to do his thing. Not for nothing, but that old man did this before. The way he shot him and walked away so calm, they should look into him.     I guess this would make a good battle cry for all those anti-gun advocates. I say "come onnnnnn.the guy was a lawyer"  LOL  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Spit shine my shoes...with spit carajo!!  I just got to te homestead and I have to say that I feel good. Today was the Dia de los muertosî celebration at Columbia University Law school. As the norm, at most ìeventsî involving poetry, it started late. I wasnít complaining, they had food. Good food to boot!!!! They had the yellow rice, tortilla chips, salsa, enchiladas and an array of soda. Life is good to me.   Anyway, as the poetry started, Nina was there doing her thing. I never heard her read and I was actually impressed with her style and poetry. She was kinda nervous and it showed but all in all, I think she did great.  As Oscar, Myself, Jayme, and Rich were the featured poets, we all did our thing. Oscar reaped the most benefits after applying his poetic prowess for about 28 mins in going first. Pobre Nina was antsy trying to get him off stage but he finally got off. I think I broke records and did a 9 minute set and got off. Jayme and Rich got shafted and had their time shaved. No biggie, they still did their thing and everyone loved them.   Some of the open micíers were pretty good but some were giving worldly diatribes. I have gotten spoiled from other events..........  Steps to reading at an open mic:  go up adjust mic say hello read poem  You are up and off in a matter of 4 mins.   The best part of the evening was a Domincan, haitian troupe playing some of the best afro cuban music I have probably ever heard. They actually got me thinking that life is to short to be upset. Through beats, rhythm, chants and singing, my life was brought to a happy walk home.  After dancing and joking and hearing great poetry, I came home running to make this blog entry.  It was worth going and I hope to attend again next year.   Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      4 days............  How can I miss someone so much that has never been in your life?  Why question yourself when you think you know what is good for you????  easy, you donít  know shit! I am a firm believer in taking destiny by the balls and making it work for me. I have something called a life and I am taking charge of it to make things work for me.   I realized it doesnít work that way with love and relationships. In trying to control everything about my life, I have shunned friends, family, relationships. I never thought of myself as a control freak but I am having second thoughts on that.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  >)))î>

      The Best thing about living aloneÖÖÖ..   I could leave my apartment at 3am to go get some food and not have to worry about waking somebody up. Yes, I just took one of my 3am jaunts into my neighborhood and it never ceases to amaze me - the array of derelicts out in the streets at that time. I wasnít going through the clubs and bars, I was walking by the 24 hour chicken spots and pizza parlors. Oh , by and by, I am pissed that they closed down the only crown fried chicken joint within walking distance from the homestead. So I had to settle for some pizza that was about as tasty as a piece of cardboard ( I wasnít to fancy on it for the fact that I had Pizza for lunch today). Granted, it was more then 17 hours ago but I am not Italian and too much of that shit doesnít bode well in my body.   So, what struck me as odd was the amount of young kats that I saw in the streets. These kids couldnít have been older then 15 or 16 tops and they were out there. One kat was with a cup of what he described as ì some nasty shit , but he was going to drink it anywayî. I guess that you have to build that tolerance for liquor at a young age. Also, with these kats were the young chics hanging with them. I donít think there is anything more unattractive then a young chic in the street that late.   From my experiences, nothing good comes from being out late in the streets. In being out there just ìhanging outî is asking for trouble from cops, other kats, people like me that prove to be dangerous if you fuck with them. You ever walk by a corner full of 10 or so and someone has to say something stupid??? Then, you say something back and they all start walking after you??? Well, make sure you stab the biggest one in the neck first. The rest will fall like leaderless mounds of mierda.  This neighborhood looks so good during the day. At night, itís the perfect steamy, fly inviting, hill of shit.  3 days, no sleep  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Answer me this  Motherfucking Sean Combs has more money then most of us can count. He has the nerve to try and raise 1 million dollars for the NYC school system????  OH man, YO DIDDY YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKER!!!! Stop buying Crystal, and Bling blinging and give a mil from your pocket!!!  On the real, that is bullshit. If I am not mistaken, Bill Gates dropped a couple of million out of his own pocket. Why is Sean Combs trying to Raise the money??? Easy, a media opportunity. He is doing nothing but taking this FREE publicity and is going to turn it around for his own gain.  The desperate sign of a desperate man falling from grace will run the NYC marathon tommorrow. Anyone has a nice high powered rifle with a scope with a range of about 1000 yards. I'm not saying, I'm just saying, ya understand.  PEace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

Anyone has a nice high powered rifle with a scope with a range of about 1000 yards. I'm not saying, I'm just saying, ya understand.  PEace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Well, I am posting after taking a few days off. I have been organizing and getting this fundraiser out to the masses.    I know that 98% have heard about the Tribute going down in the Bowery on Jan 4th. I book 4 hours of poetry with some High caliber poets. Shit, I got Quincy Troupe coming through. California poet laureate is making the mic his own for a full 7 mins.   Everything is ok with me.   I am just kinda weirded out by having to say goodbye to 2003. I usually cry with my year being as fucked up as all heavenly possible. This year, 2003 was probably the best year of my life. I am happy with some good thing accomplished under my belt. Shit, I am even starting 2004 with a bang.  I just want happiness. That is all I want and basically need.  I will be here alone at home bringing in the new year.  I choose to be this way and it is the best for me right now. Most likely, I won't be taking messages but I will get back to everyone eventually.   I got mad love for all you Blog stalkers. I hope you all have the healthiest year coming. Remember that I will be there for everyone of you at the drop of a hat. I will not hesitate for a true friend in need.  I am sorry for any heartache I have caused  I hope I made most people proud.  Loving you always  Fish  >)))">

      PRAISE DAY FOR PEDRO PIETRI:  A Benefit Poetry Reading & Celebration for el Rev   The Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, will host the first of several fundraisers for the great Nuyorican poet Pedro Pietri on Sunday, Jan. 4, from noon-4. Pietri, who has added stomach cancer to a long list of maladies he sees as related to his exposure to Agent Orange in the VietNam War, has vowed to fight the disease by alternative methods.  Among the poets confirmed thus far: Amiri Baraka, Amina Baraka, David Henderson, Steve Cannon, Quincy Troupe, Emily XYZ, Bob Holman, Willie Perdomo, Cheryl Boyce Taylor, Hersch Silverman, Danny Shot, Fish, Grisel, Karen Jaime, Bonafide Rojas,  and 5 year old poet prodigy Autum and many others. Poets will be reading from Pietri's extensive oeuvre, which will surely raise the spirits via his hilarious, biting, surrealist verse.   Historic photos by Marlkis Momber will be auctioned off. Memorabilia - Condom Poems, Telephone Booth Poems, rare copies of I Never Promised You a Cheeseburger and other Pietri manuscripts and memorabilia will be sold. You may also Rent-a-Coffin by the hour or day.  Admission will be by contribution, with all proceeds going to the Pedro Fund.  Donations will be solicited throughout the night, at the door, and at bucket by the microphone - all praise the poetry, and pay for it, too!  Hosted by Oscar Bermeo & Guy Lecharles Gonzalez For more info: Fish@louderarts.com  917-209-4211  Tribute Fundraiser for the Rev Pedro Pietri II & III info at nuyoricanhostess@hotmail.com  ******Following article is from Juan Gonzalez from the Daily News ****************   'El Reverendo' just not ready to leave pulpit     The sad news spread rapidly this weekend: Pedro Pietri, the king of Latino poetry in this town for more than 30 years, is suffering from inoperable stomach cancer.  And what a hilarious reign it has been.  Usually sporting a long black overcoat and a black bowler, with scraggly shoulder-length hair and mustache, Pietri, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1944 and served in the Vietnam War in 1967-68, sarcastically calls himself El Reverendo, the minister of the fictional Church of the Mother of All Tomatoes.  A typical Pietri poetry reading is somewhere between a vaudeville act and a Pentecostal revival. His audiences are erupting in laughter one moment and fighting back tears the next.  For those of us who came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, Pietri's epic "Puerto Rican Obituary" - with its evocation of "nervous breakdown streets/ where the mice live like millionaires/ and the people do not live at all" - still remains the single most powerful expression of the Latino diaspora in this country.  Other Pietri poems, like "Suicide Note from a Cockeroach in a Low-Income Housing Project" and his extended series of "Telephone Booth" verses have been acclaimed as first-rate examples of urban street poetry and forerunners of today's rap or slam contests.  Pietri's prolific production includes more than 20 books of poetry and plays. His work has been translated into several languages.  His last performance was Nov. 8 at Town Hall, where he participated in the 30th-anniversary celebration of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the cultural center he founded on the lower East Side with playwrights Miguel Pinero and Miguel Algarin.  Three days after the Town Hall event, Pietri fell ill.  "First I couldn't hold down any food," Pedro told me yesterday.  "Then I couldn't hold down liquids. But being a hardhead, I thought it was just stomach ulcers. I didn't want to accept the truth."   He finally checked into Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, where doctors discovered a malignant tumor and immediately performed surgery. But by then the tumor had spread to his stomach.  Cancer is the latest and most serious of the physical maladies Pietri has confronted over the past few years.  Some, he is convinced, were caused by exposure in Vietnam to the herbicide Agent Orange.  "When I was in the infantry in Vietnam, we used to see the planes spraying us with that stuff all the time," Pietri recalled.  For the first 20 years after his return from the war, his health was fine.  "Then all of a sudden I came down with glaucoma, then with a bunch of skin diseases and now this cancer," he said.  His doctors are recommending radiation and chemotherapy to attack the tumor, but Pietri, always the cynical rebel, has rejected their approach.  "They did what they could, but I don't want that radiation or to have them just cutting me up again," he said.  Instead he has decided to seek alternative medical treatment next month in Tijuana, Mexico, a procedure his health insurance carrier refuses to cover.  So last week his family and his friends at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe quickly established a benefit fund to pay for Pietri's treatment in Mexico. They are asking anyone who has enjoyed his poetry to come to his aid now.  Those wishing to help can send a contribution to the ÖÖ.   Pedro Pietri Health Benefit Fund,  c/o Nuyorican Poets Cafe, P.O. Box 20794,  New York, N.Y.  10009.   "I'm not giving up. I'm going to kick this thing," Pietri said yesterday.  All those young Latino poets hoping to pick up the king's mantle will just have to wait, because Pedro is feeling too good to check out right now.   Woke up this morning  feeling excellent,  picked up the telephone  dialed the number of my  equal opportunity employer  to inform him i will not  be in to work today.  "are you feeling sick?"  the boss asked me  "no sir," i replied:  "i am feeling too good  to report to work today.  if i feel sick tomorrow  i will come in early!"

      8:30am en la casa Fish and not a germ was stirring, Let me make a wish!!!   I WISH I WAS 6 Again.   :)  Nah. Everything is good. I got up early to go help the parental untis with the wrapping of the pasteles. After a few choice phone calls. Everything should go well.   I feel pretty good today. I have been watching the Christmas Story marathon and I can't get over that movie. If that kid has to be reaping the benefits lovely from that movie. TNT s sowing it for 24 hours straight.  So , no trees in my house with children making a mad dash for the presents under it.  No wife waking me up with a key to a Lexus parked outside. No grandkids coming over with a tie for the 8th year in a row.  I woke up to a rather clear blue sky. At least I know that millions of kids around the NYC are happy as hell with gifts. That makes me feel good to know on this day smiles are somewhere. I won't depress myself and think too much about the people that have nothing. I do think about them but I choose to think about the happy ones instead.  Well, I am off to wrap.  Peace, Love, Pork chops  Fish  Merry Christmas

      Last night I headed out to El Dorado's.  This was the nightclub where I was bouncing about two years ago.  They had their little Christmas party and it was nice, I went up for the food and the shit was crazy. Half of the chics up there had kids within the last year or two and it was surprising to see that.  I even saw my counterpart that took my place there. Talk about lookin like a bitchass. There are several types of  bouncers.  People that stop fights Bouncers that arbitrate Bouncers that intimidate everybody Bouncers that will fuck you up if you fight in their club  This guy is neither. He looks as useful  as an umbrella on a sunny day.  If the owner feels he can do a good job and just take up space to have another body there, by all means... you go for it.   Bouncing for me was cool and I never hated the job. I hated the bullshit that came with the job. The problem is that people want to come into a place of business and do what they please -  that is not the case. This club is not your house and you can not wear your hat, smoke weed, sell coke, fuck in bathroom's. There are stringent rules here and you must abide by them. If you choose not to, my maglight will guarantee  about 20 stitches across your forehead. Then, I will throw into the street and not blink.  Yes folks, I was bad,.  But I am reformed and loving  I like birds and children Flowers and painting Knitting and crafts.  Fish

      When I went to the championship back in 99 with the Outlaws, I worked out everyday in the GYM. I put my body through such a painful regiment of Power Lifting and thrust. I wanted that chip and I killed myself. We lost by one point and I cried on the sidelines.  315 bench press, punching bag thrusts, 800 leg press, 80 pound dumbell press. All to lose by one point. Was this worth it??? I most certainly think so. I was at an all time high on the strength meter. I was killin em on the line.   This Jan 5 is this LouderChampion tournament. I have started my mental gym of getting amped. I can't take my time and just wait for it to come around because I would be a nervous wreck. I did the survivor slam several months back and my stomach wanted to run out of my body and down the street. When I got to my car after the slam, I was doubled over in pain. This last slam wasn't bad because I worked my nerves to the point where they get used to the stress. Little by little, I get used to it.  I am thinking of going hard with what works and maintain a run in the slam. I wanted to challenge myself and go with new work but I am going with the solid poems for now.  I am working on some new poems now. One is personal for me and it kills me to even talk about it. The concept is cool I just have to get the good words to go with the concept.   Anyway, let me run.  I am good today  I am happy   Yea.  Fish  >)))">

      Inspiration comes from..........  .........those special little moments that you capture when your hearts jumps a beat. Nah. not really but shit it sounded good.  Well, I am home and I decided to write a small reflection on 2003. Well, more like write whatever comes to my mind.   2003 was one of those years that gave me so much. I am actually trying to do a mental backtrack.   Poetry Highlights of 2003  March: co-founding Acentos being part of a full circle as Guy is our first feature April: Becoming official member of the louderARTS project Artist Organization 	-	Featured reader at First Wednesday With Roger and Lynne July: Member of Team Acentos in which we did better then Team Urbana August: Going to Chicago to experience my first Nationals and seeing team Union Square miss out by .1  	-	Starting the Rikers Creative writing and poetry workshop 	-	Featured reader for the MindBuilders Creative arts center September: Starting Community Word training 	-	Featured reader at the Clinton Street Festival 	-	Special host for Poetas con Cafe in Spanish Harlem October: Featured  reader at La Causaís Voice for the voiceless in Amhearst 	-	Featured reader at Soul Nation at Blue Stockings bookstore November: Featuring at Acentos in front of the most important people in my life 	-	Featured reader at Dia de los Muertos celebration at Columbia University December: Getting those 2 points to allow me to get some rank in my attempts in making the UNION square slam team  Good year with the poetry.  IT is a better year off. My Brother Eric got married in September. Regardless of the bullshit we all went through. My man Eric got married and everything  was priceless. Dickboy and I started working on rebuilding a quasi respectable friendship. Jessica and I seem to be working on something also and I have a relationship with my God Daughter. Oscar and I started working on creating a more constructive way on speaking to each other. Tom , Mike are still my dawgs and everything is god with them. I finished parole on October 7th and that was PERFECT  As usual, I have the low points in my life:  Almost got evicted in Febraury Lost 15,000 dollars in some techincal bullshit. gave up $80,000 to have a clean conscious and move on with my life Got together with Lenny Broke up with Lenny Got back together with Lenny Broke up with Lenny See a pattern?  Got sick with the flu really bad My job hasnít been the best place to be.  All in all.   I am happy. I am good. I am still just soaking everything in to become a Better writer. I want to be a historic writer and a poet.  I just need a couple of years.    I want to be a better person and remain righteous. I want to love more then what I hate. I want to support more then critique. The love that I give everyone is love that I want them to soak up and move it forward.   Support your fellow poet and send them love  Merry Christmas and happy New Year  Happy Three Kings day

      The other day I was having a conversation with Rich about my Spanish in some of my poems. I wasn't really sure if it was the right way to take on a slam situation when 4 out of the 5 judges might get lost when you speak spanish. I was going back and forth with this whole thing and wasn't sure where I stood.   Until today!!! Martin Espada on the boob tube getting interviewed by Ilan Stavens on a show called " La Plaza ". The battle that I had within my self was clearly answered by Espada. " I don't feel obligated to translate all the time". In other words, fuck em if they don't understand Spanish.  Special notice: The Slam will be very special on Jan 5th.  1st round 3 mins 2nd round 2 mins 3rd round 1 min 4th round 2 min 5th round no time limit  Excuse me while I attempt to remove the wrench from my machine.  Peace

      Alas, time to write and reflect. Just got back from a good evening today. Headed out to catch Mama Procope and Rog at another Vision into Art production. Several months back, they were both in a production called ìDemocrazzyî. It was mind blowing simply with the introspective aspect of everything from the start to the end.  Today was good. Lynne was easily at the top of her performance. She flowed easily and never once seemed at odd with her lines. She truly glided gracefully across the stage in an awesome burgundy dress that made her bleed sexuality.  The show was broken up and the end of it was much more tangible. The film, video, music were all at a time of the civil rights movement. They showed some pretty disturbing slides that had my temper being tested.  I am not too keen on much of our countryís history. When I see civil rights protests, beatings, lynchings, Police brutality, I get.......... mad. Black or white pictures or not, I have aright to be angry because this country allowed racism. This country allowed segregation. This country allowed profiling against minorities. This country allowed too much. No ìIím sorryísî will fix things. No reparations. Nothing.  Fish

      Christmas time is cool in my books. I say this because I really don't care if you want something or not or if I am getting something or not.  The whole gift giving thing is cool but if I get something.... I am happy. If I get nothing.... well..... I'm happy. My life goes way beyond " let's get Fish something really nice for Christmas". If you want to do something nice for me, don't get on my nerves 364 other days in the New year.    Here is my question? If I don't take the time out to get you anything, does this mean I don't care about you? I guess those late nights when you needed a ride is null and void. Those nights when you needed a hug, ear, or even a friend is out the window.    My boss is a piece of shit all year round. Then come Christmas time and she gets me a 10 dollar gift and this is supposed to erase all the shit she puts me through?? Mierda.  Most of the time I just want to spend some quality time and love with the people I care for. I don't want a gift, just give me your presence and let me be grateful for a friendship that I can count on.    Anyway, I ranted that after reading other capitalist blogs.   I am doing well today. Yesterday was our company Christmas party and it took me three days to set it up and about 3 hours to clean up afterwards. It was well worth it. I even got some kudos from the company President in an e-mail this morning  ***********************************************   This is the e-mail I sent out...........

I say the smiles were plenty throughout the festivities.  The food was unabatedly perfect. The Beer, soda, and wine were abundant enough to leave any resident drunks content.  As my day is done, it is always a pleasure to work amongst such dedicated individuals to ensure every detail brings a tear to the eye of even  the utmost perfectionist - mainly me.  Thank you for making my upcoming 17th year at Blair and Petry a Godsend.  The beer has been put up for grabs and 4 bottles of wine are in storage in my office for any future activities. The CD/Receiver is also in my office under the watchful eyes of my jolly little elves. Mike has assisted me enough to get a good headstart on getting the 9th floor back to par to show for any prospective renters. Our Cleaning people were blessed with a good array of goodies from our event.  Thank you once again and I look forward to a wonderful New Year.

      PLEASE HELP OUT  Those who know about the Nuyorican poetry movment know how important this man is to the community of poets at large in New York City. Please copy this and send it along to any interested parties.  *******************************************  "Woke up this morning / feeling excellent! / Picked up the telephone / dialed the number / Of my equal opportunity / employer to inform him / I will not be in / to work today! / Are you feeling sick? / the Boss asked me, / "No Sir I replied, / I am feeling too good / to report to work today! / If I feel sick tomorrow / I will come in early.  -from "Telephone Booth Number 905," by El Reverendo Pedro Pietri   PEDRO PIETRI HEALTH BENEFIT FUND  c/o Nuyorican Poets Caf√© P.O. Box 20794 New York, NY 10009    December 14, 2003  [name]  [street address] [or email address]  [city, state, zip]    Dear Friend:  If you have ever laughed, reveled in, or enjoyed one of Pedro's poems- -or if you can recall a line from any one of his countless poems-- then this letter is of utmost urgency to you. It is with great pain that we report publicly that renowned Puerto Rican / Nuyorican poet, Rev. Pedro Pietri, is seriously ill. Recently he has had surgery at Bronx Lebanon Hospital to treat his ailments. However, the medical prognosis is dismal. El Rev Pedro Pietri, the author of Puerto Rican Obituary, in its tenth printing is a classic in the Puerto Rican literature...his entire life is poetry. He is an outspoken advocate for the Puerto Rican Diaspora.  The life of this eminent poet is a reflection of the circumstances of our age--from the Puerto Rican migrations, through the disintegration of the New York neighborhoods, to the Vietnam War era and the aftermath of environmental pollution, El Rev. Pedro Pietri has been the creative voice to the madness that surrounds us. The life of a poet has never been easy. Pedro was victimized by the war as a result of Agent Orange exposure and ignored by the parties responsible for his condition. Now he is succumbing to an ever- increasing number of illnesses related to this and the attendant stress that has slowly ravaged his body. These include glaucoma, a compromised circulatory system from high blood pressure; his skin tissue affected by advanced vitiligo; stomach ulcers; and now, a cancerous tumor.  This is a Mission Critical Appeal. Especially since there is hope.  Again reflecting our times, the treatments that could be his saving mechanisms are not available nor recognized by the medical establishment in the U.S.A.  His friends, his fellow poets, and his family have organized this effort. Our hope entails treatment at the Oasis of Hope Hospital in Mexico. Results from their treatment indicate a high degree of recovery and non-recurrence in many of their patients. It is expensive beyond Pedro and his family's financial means. Expenses include treatment, travel expenses, lodging, post-treatment, health management, and a healthy return home.  The cost of treatment at minimum is about $30,000. An individual contribution of a $1,000 (tax deductible) would be most helpful. However, any contribution will be deeply appreciated. Please make checks payable to:  Nuyorican Poets Cafe, Inc.,  with memo: Pedro Pietri Health Benefit Fund  c/o Nuyorican Poets Cafe  P.O. Box 20794  New York, New York 10009    We are seeking your support and contributions for Pedro's treatment in Mexico by January 2004. We pray that you will:  Sincerely,  Friends and Family of Pedro Pietri  Help Save The Life of This Treasure: The Reverend Pedro Pietri

      As the subject header clearly states, this is where I stand for now.  Without invading the privacy of others but keeping my sanity through a public post - Love is hard shit.  Yesterday, I went to a Christmas party hosted by the 21 bar. It was a whitefest and I was not impressed.  I was actually very uncomfortable. My suit felt to snug, my shirt was too white (I prefer dark colors), My hair looked weird pushed back plastered down with Gel. The food was rated a 5 out of ten and I was not impressed. Filet mignon is supposed to be Medium rare at best. My piece of steak was still trying to make a break for it when it was placed in front of me. I think I heard my piece of steak moo and I had to stab it to make the final kill. Got the Creme Boule( Flan for white folks) and headed home after my aggravation  hit the highpoint of the meter.  Took the train home and got to my house and I was aggravated, upset, pissed off and I went to sleep.   Just another typical day  Fish

      Time comes and goes and I wonder why I don't care about it. Yea, it's one of those days. I just got to work and my Boss already walks in and annoys the shit out of me.  I really have to do something about trying to find other means of gainful employment. Of course, I get away with murder here and any other job would actually fire me if I spend 98% of my days writing poetry and creating blog entries.   Anyway, besides that cancer ridden crack whore getting on my nerves. My day should be good. Tonight I have a Christmas party to attend with my loving Lenny. It is going to be nice because I get to remove the dust from my court suit. Yes people, suit and tie affair. I went last year and I felt really good. Lenny saw me and tried to rape me in the bathroom after I was looking all handsome. LOL   I look forward to getting all nicey nice sometimes. It gives me this new renowned faith that I could look decent when I really want to.  Yesterday was a cool day too. I had to meet with one of my interns to create a lesson plan for the Community Word Project. This girl Claudia is so kooky but she is really cool. We got the lesson plan done and worked very well together. We took into consideration each other's suggestions and critique and changed ideas around nicely.   When I got to her job, I got there a little bit too early so I was walking around 33rd street and 7th avenue ( Madison Square Garden). Last night was the Z-100 Jingle ball so the place was jam packed with everything from little screaming white girls to the typical scalper. I tend to just walk right by scalpers since I have no interest in buying a ticket. Last night, I heard something for the first time in my life that stopped me in my tracks.........   I am walking and this dude is handing out flyers and in Fish fashion, I ignore him. He then says " you wanna get your butthole eaten out". I did a double take and I was like - " holy shit". I looked at him with my look of death and he gave me a card to the nearest whorehouse on 28th street. I thought he was trying to make a homosexual advance and stabbing him in the eye was considered.  Now I know that NY has gone to shit.   So my day will consist of getting some things done and going home about 3:45pm to change and come back down to this Christmas shindig.   Peace, Love, Porkchoppy  Fish

      Well, I am back home with this warm feeling all over my body. It is not the flu trying to kill me. It is a feeling of accomplishment, love, dedication.   Tonight was one of those nights that made things perfect in my life. Acentos went out with a wild West bang tonight. Our features were Alixa Garcia and Naima Penniman with the Uniting the States tour. I am not easily left in awe or speechless but these two wonderful poets have quite achieved that difficult task. From the opening to the very last word, they left the Blue Ox with something much stronger then Poetry. They left a message of Power, change, conviction and awareness. These two poets have left their mark on Acentos and my heart. I tip my hat and forever hold a candle up to their performance.   Tonight was the last Acentos for 2003. 9 months of grunt work, flyers, features, hosting, and all that other behind the scenes bullshit that we have to deal with.  9 months that have gone very very quickly. 9 months of featured poets that have raised this quality bar of performance and craft to almost unreachable heights. As for Guy LeCharles Gonzalez being our first feature and setting an incredible precedent........all the way to an astoundingly well put collaboration from Alixa and Naima, we have started something that I am proud to be a part of.   Oscar went up there tonight and he thanked most of the people that have supported Acentos. So many faces have come and gone but it is all support in the same.  Every single person that comes to Acentos makes a mark and we will and always appreciate that.  I would love to thank every poet, supporter, curious passer-by with a personal hug. Alas, I canít. I could just send my love and blessings and go along for the ride known as Acentos 2004.   My love for poetry grew a little bit more today. My love for my life grew a little bit more today.     Thanks to all you motherfuckers that have said nothing but good things about Acentos and the work that we put in.  Thanks to all the features that have come through and left their hearts on stage. Thanks to all the people that have listened. Thanks to all the people that have loved me. Thanks for all the people that I have showed love and appreciated that one good bye hug and thank you for coming out to Acentos. Thanks to Louder, Bowery and Nuyo.    Why am I crying? simple, life is good.   Peace, Love, Porkchops  Merry Christmas, Happy New year, Happy Three Kings day   Fish

      Last night was one of those night that rarely ever comes into my life. I made it to Bar 13 after being away for over three weeks. I realized that I missed those motherfuckers way toooo much.  I think I needed some time away to get some POETIC priorities in order.   Yesterday was Mr Jason Carney the purebred Texas homey doing his thing. His feature set was pretty solid and I was excited to see him make the stage his. I got some serious Nats Flashbacks when he was wearing a Black T-shirt with all the slam venue's in Texas.   You all know that Union Square sends a team to Nats every year to compete against 60 some odd teams from all over the United States. In order to try and make the  slam team at Union Square you have to slam and accumulate points to compete in Semi-finals.  Yesterday I got my two points. YEAH BABY!!!!  Those two points mean the world to me right now.    I slammed against Shappy, Abena, Karen, M.C, Ray, Elana, Michaela. Good slam and I pulled out the big guns to make the third round. After  a highest score "headlines" round (28.0) and a Lowest score in the second round (27.0) - I had enough points for the third round.  Abena, Me, and Shappy went up there and did our thing. We finished in that order and I was pretty happy. Abena took the slam and I am loving her more and more everyday. If I am losing to anybody, Abena would be my first choice.  It felt good last night to bring it and do my thing.  We went to Res and munched on some serious chicken wings and talked  until the later hours so I am feeling it right now. I am tired and I need to get some rest.  So Bar 13 won't see my face until January 5th and that seems like ions away. I am slamming next week at the Smokin word tour in Brooklyn. It should be fun.   Ahhhhhhh.............. Also, Big Crazy shout- outs to my motherfuckin favorite white boy poet - M.C Siegal. Today is his birthday so go show the Kat some love!!!!!  urlLink Pero-K-Sun  is here to stay  so show him some Birthday love.  I am out   Tonight is Acentos  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      The gray piraguas are all over the street.  Walking in the Bronx is about as easy as history test about the future. Seems that parking tonight is not going to be an option when I come home from 13. Seems that the iron horse will see my face. I am not much of a loafer so I won't be begging for a ride home.   I had one of the most uneventful weekends. I stood home and channel surfed. Amazingly enough, there isn't one show on TV that I would like to talk about. I will say this much - the Wizard of Oz is the shit. Oh man, I love those munchkins! Even yesterday, I learn something after seeing this almost once a year since the first breathe I took.    You know the part when Dorothy is in Munchkin land and those three munchkins represented the " Lollipop Guild"? Well, I never knew they were saying the "lollipop Guild". I always thought they were saying...... "we represent the lollipop kids". So, here I am at the age of 32 and I feel like a moron. I still love that movie.    I spent most of my day talking and chit chatting on the phone with several people.  The conversations ranged from life to problems with current boyfriends.  I never understood how people can have so many problems with someone and stick around. I should be one to preach, when it comes down to the relationship field I am about as useful as a Mustang 5.0 with no tires. I am ready to go but I just can't do it.  Yesterday was Cheryl Boyce Taylor's shindig in the Bowery and I chose to stay home instead of heading out. The snow, people I didn't quite want to see, and the cold were all good ingredients to keep me home.  I am not good at hiding my disdain for people that get on my nerves so I tend to stay away. It is a shame because I am sacrificing plenty with this mentality. I have not attended parties, functions, festivals, readings simply because I knew people would be linger about. I am getting to a better place but I still am not ready.  Tonight is a good night. I should slam tonight in my vain attempts to get some points for the 2003 - 2004 Union square Slam Debacle. I am also slamming next Monday for Smokin Word to represent respective neighborhoods in NYC. It should be good.  Time to goo  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      I am about to start writing this blog with the TV glowing itís death rayís into my brain. I have it on the comedy channel and I see that this Monday night is a new show called ì Hebrew Hammerî.  As we can see writers are lacking creativity, originality, and political correctness is out the window.  Whatís up folks, I am here at the homestead snowed in like most people in NYC. I am not one of those peeps that slogs through the snow for anything other then what I really have too. Since I spent about 6 days sick and home confined, I am used to it.  So this snow is so nice to some people. Me personally the snow isnít anything but the frozen spit of Satan falling upon us. If I could go to an open field and admire the beauty of trees covered with the white stuff, then I would be happy. What really happens......  slush slipping canít move the car  canít find parking if you take a chance and move the car salt spreaders that eat away at your paint the snowball that hits you and you canít stab the kid in the eye because he is just 12 years old wet pants wet boots wet socks runny nose cold cheeks headaches  frozen slippery steps  Call me grinch, call me a snow hater, call me a typical NuYorker that likes his life normal  The best snowstorm was in 1977. It was a blizzard and me and my moms went out to play in the snow. She was frolicking in the like she was a little kid herself. We made snowballs, snow angels and waited until my hands went numb. You ever did that ???? Played with the snow so much and then came home and your hands are so numb that you cant turn the big knob on the TV to the channel you want to see? That is when you knew you played enough.  The worst snowstorm for me was in 1995. I was in my Exís house ( demon spawn bitch from hell) and I went over early in the morning to chill. After a day of just watching movies ñ shit went down hill. I looked out the window and the snow was at 10 solid inches and I wasnít attempting the drive home.  I got stuck in Queens and I canít stand sleeping in any other beds besides mines. My ex ( demon spawn bitch from hell) was a nurse and she had no choice but to go to work. I got stuck alone in her house with her cat ( Demon spawn bitch from hell 2 ). I hated that cat. Every time I would go over. It would hiss and try to jump on me. That day was my redemption. As all cats are greedy little heathens, I went to feed him and I put his food out. When he eats, the world stops and he notices nothing. So I figured, I could just feed him all day and he wonít bother me. You ever seen a cat that overeats, they could barely move. LOL. I took the cat and tortured it most of the day. He never bothered me after that . He was scared of me after that .  Snow, Snow.......... Bah humbug  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      What's the deal people.  Just got in from work and I can't believe when things insist on going wrong- they do!!  The train ride was the typical one. Got the paper, face surfed, rode smooth. Right before we hit 59th street the train rolls to a stop. The garbling over the P.A begins....   "I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a sick passenger on the train in front of us, They are seeking medical attention, we will be moving shortly"   Ok, no biggie, I am up to my comics and it is not that bad. Not even 10 mins later another announcement   " Ladies and gentlemen we seem to be experiencing signal switch problems at 34th street. We are on it and we should be moving shortly"   Damn, that is crazy is going through my mind. Here we are and more shit pops up. I hope everything is well.  Behold, the huge constant swoosh of air is heard from under the train and I know this means the brakes were pulled.   " Ladies and gentlemen, it seems that the emergency brake has been triggered on this train, our crew will check this out and we should be moving shortly.    We moved after 30 mins to 59th street and then the train didn't go down six avenue because of the signal problems. I had to walk from 8th avenue and it is fucking brick outside!!!!!!!!  Then these fuckers want to raise the train fare? I wish the days of hopping the train were back. When I was working in C-town, I never paid the fare. It was 75 cents back then but shit, why pay if I could hop?  If you noticed, I changed around my blog and added some stuff. Don't get it twisted, I did it because I fucked up my last blog.  I was going to steal Oscar's Template again but I wasn't in the mood to hear shit. Well, I actually did but I chose to get creative instead of being lazy.  Let me know what ya think in the guestbook. Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish( I am alive ) Dawg  P.S IF any of ya people out there are aware of any jobs that can pay some bills, let me know so I can pass on some info. My favorite  urlLink  White Boy Poet is two shakes of a tail from becoming homeless and he needs a J.O.B. So go to his blog and leave a message or e-mail him.

      Back at the jobstead. Got a couple of e-mails that have put a good smile on my face. A couple of months back, this dude was asking me some questions about slam and poetry at the Bowery. Turns out that he is going to print up my interview in an NYU periodical of sorts.  Tonight we are going to meet up and go over some more questions and go a little bit deeper into the interview.   Another e-mail was from Brother Shaggy up North. No, not locked up but up North from here. He finally launched his website and he has Acentos linked and also my Blog. That definitely put a smile on my face. I always liked Shaggy because he brings new meaning to " Jibaro rematao". He is one of those youngs kats that should have been born years a before his time.  I know for a fact that he would have been running with the young lords and creatin all types of havoc to better " La Causa ". February 15, 2004 is a huge book launch party for the Legend himself, Bonafide Rojas. I am going to seriously plug it and make sure everyone goes. No threats this time, not yet at least.   I was reading MC's blog and he is all bent crazy how every is writing some shit in their blogs.  I can safely assume that I read the same blogs as him and I don't see anything really new. Except for Diane shouting the shit out of Oscar over some drunken bullshit they got into on Monday, there isn't anything life changing anyway. Maybe Matt didn't quite know, Diane and Oscar are two pitbulls that have been ripping each others throat for about a year. So don't sweat that to much. They are both really little Chihuahuas with no real imminent threat to each other.  I am doing well today. I am getting over this flu and every day I am getting back to normal. I was going home yesterday  and felt kinda woozy. What can I say, too much clothing and too much mierda to deal with. That tree lighting gets worse every year. I didn't even get close to the fuckin thing and everywhere was packed.  Christmas time is here. I know that many people can be grinches but I tend to like the holidays. The food and holiday joy always keeps me in a good mood. This year,  se jodio  todo el mundo por que no hay dinero. So, if I send you a Christmas Card, that means it is your gift.   Oh  Actually.......  Whoever reads this, e-mail me  Fish@louderarts.com your address because this year I am sending out Christmas cards. If not, you ain't getting shit. LOL   Let me bounce  Peace

       I am back at work!!!!,    Yes, back in the place that makes it all happen - from Poetry to financial stability I am here. I am actually happy after being stuck in da crib for 6 days, that shit can get to ya.  I realized after channel surfing for six straight days that TV is more full of shit then ever.  I can't believe that Cablevision can have over 100 channels and they give bullshit.   The best show right now that completely kills me is Blind Date. I love that show so much. The concept of the show is to have people send in tapes and they get set up on blind dates. The dates themselves are somewhat blah but the graphic designers behind it all are pure GENIUS!!! They have these little pop-ups come through out the dates and they are fucking hilarious!!!   98% of the show is based out in L.A and you catch some "B" actresses and Porno stars on it. I caught Cheyenne Silver on it and you all know she is my favorite porn star. I caught Steve-O from jackass fame and that guy is insane! I caught Stacy Hollywood who is another porn star and she was throwing herself on this dude and the guy was like.... nah!!! His face was priceless as to this women was grabbing him 30 mins into the date and he was scared. Her policy was " I will not have sex with fat guys, besides that I am game".  I started questioning myself how much money I needed to move to L.A !  Some of the dates end up as an intro to soft porn. Some dates resemble paint drying on a bridge. Yet, behold the powers of non-chemistry and some dates have fireworks. They start hating each other as soon as they see each other.  I saw this one lasdy get in a jacuzzi with this dude and she told him to take off his pants. One pant removal later and she was like " uuhhhh...... I don't think this date is working out" and she bounced. That dude went on national TV and was shouted out for having a small pee-pee. LOL  It's the little things in life that make me smile.  Oh LENNY!!!  I WANT TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU TODAY CARAJO!!!!  LOL  I have issues people.   Peace, Love, Porkchops

      I donít know what is funnier, Miranda from Sex and the city getting a face full of sperm ñaccidentally I MIGHT ADD or finding out that Don Francisco from Sabado Gigante is Jewish and German.  Yes, today I found out that the most famous Latino man on any given Saturday night is Jewish and German!!!!!    I was talking to a friend of mines and she informed me that a friend of hers told her that Don Francisco is Jewish. I was like ìNahhhhhhhhhhî. I got on the internet and with some searching, that motherfucker is a full blooded Jewish German kat that was born in Chile. Here is the article........    Don Francisco   Don Francisco is the artistic name of Mario Kreutzberger, a Chilean television host. He was born in Talca, Chile in 1940 to a German Jewish family. His parents had fled to Chile escaping from Nazi persecution. As a youth, he traveled to New York to study to be a tailor, but he spent most of the time watching TV. Back in Chile, where TV was just beginning, Don Francisco started a TV show in 1962, and he named it S·bados Gigantes. In it, he adapted many of the formulas he had seen in American TV to the Chilean public. The show became an instant hit that has lasted 40 years as the #1 viewed show in Chile. In 1985, the show began to be produced in Miami, Florida, with the same formula used in Chile, with the slightly different name of S·bado Gigante. Don Francisco immediately became a household name among Latino families across the United States, and in the following five years, television networks from all over Latin America started buying the show. Spain also became a show customer during that period, and with that, 99 percent of Spanish language speaking people knew who Don Francisco was. For a few years, he continued flying weekly to Chile to tape the Chilean S·bados Gigantes, and back to Miami to do the international show. His is a four hour long variety show, including contests, comedy, interviews and a traveling camera section. The traveling camera section, or C·mara Viajera (originally La PelÌcula Extranjera, The Foreign Film), has taken Don Francisco to over 185 countries world-wide, many of them more than once. He not only imported from American TV some of the ideas for his show, but also the idea of doing a Telethon, similar to the one Jerry Lewis has done for years in the USA. Don Francisco has done many telethons to raise money for disaster relief and to help disabled children. Don Francisco in his show has interviewed many celebrities, including Roberto Duran, Cristina Saralegui, Charytin and many others. In addition, his show has launched the careers of many famous entertainers, such as Sissy and many others In 1992, Don Francisco was accused by one of his models of sexual harassment, but the charges were dismissed. Nowadays, he has stopped flying back and forth between Miami and Chile each week to tape both the Chilean show and the international show, and his daughter Viviana is becoming quite famous as the host of the Chilean show. Apparently, having to travel so much between Miami and his home country each week, plus having to travel to worldwide locations to tape La C·mara Viajera, was becoming too strenuous for him. As of 2002, Don Francisco's show has completed 40 years, and its host has said he has no plans to retire until the day he dies.    I am going to pROTEST  that us latinos can't even have the most popular latino show. What is next??? The Puerto Rican day Parade??  I am buggin out over here

      Home fighting the flu for the 5th day. Last night was rather interesting. I was in my bed coughing and sneezing and doing my usual pleghm removal from my body. I sneezed last night and blew my nose and threw the paper into the trash. I still felt some nice warm stuff come from the nasal facility. I proceeded to the bathroom and I knew things were not good. From the flu, I am thinking I now have ebola. Both my eyes were bloodshot in the inner corners and the blood was coming down hardcore from the nose.   I tried to put my EMT training to take care of me ñ didnít work. I was trying to stay away from the hospital because I thought I was going to get over this shit. The nosebleed changed that attitude quickly.  Called a cab and headed to Montefiore E.R. I wasnít calling an ambulance to spend 700 dollars for 4 blocks.  What happens??  Seems that you are sick Mr Vargas  NO SHIT ASSHOLE!!  The nosebleed was from the violent coughing and hacking.   They give me a prescription for amoxycilin ñ take 1 every six hours. Guess what folks, I have been doing that since day one and it hasnít been working. I had these meds at home and I was popping them.   Today, I actually feel better. I am not coughing that much and the nasal cavity seems to be clearing up.  I am home and I am not dead. At least they took my blood and found out I was ìsickî. What the fuck, I hate doctors!  Please call me at home. I am bored  Peace, love, Porkchops

      It is of no secret my disdain of local authorities here in NYC. I mainly direct this rebellious attitude towards the NYPD. Not only have they proved over the years to walk heavy and carry a quick trigger finger ñ they have been nothing but power crazy. I am making this a pretty long post but I hope you stay with me.  Yesterday I had to be somewhere at 6pm sharp. For those that know me, I pride myself on punctuality. I hate when people are late meeting me so I never do it to nobody. When I come home to embark in the hooptie I see a cop car blockin me. I knew this was not good. They could be there from 10 mins to an hour depending on whatever call they are on. 5:20 is the time and I have 40 mins to my destination.   5:30 is when I decided to call the local precint in a vain attempt to have them radio the police officers and have them move the car. I knew them being on a call would make this a super longshot but I tried.  Desk Sargent Penny told me ì They are on an emergency 911 call and they have to take the report.î Ok, this was a waste of 55 cents for information to give me the number to the precint but I tried.   5:45 pm and I make my phonecall. ì I am going to be late so we might have to talk another dayî. I was slightly miffed because I really wanted to talk and get some things off my chest and try to find a way to deal with some things. There goes my evening which was shot to shit.  6:10 pm I start calling people to entertain them with my story of being stuck in my car. Roger thought it was funny and we made plans to meet up to hit a party but that is another story.  6:27 is when the cops walk out the door and they get in the car. My day done and I wasnít going to get angry. There was no valid point in aggravating myself in seeing these two cops. A small piece of me imagined myself getting out the car and beefing that I had to be somewhere and I missed something extremely important because they blocked me in. I imagined them and I exchanging several rounds of heated rhetoric and ranting. They come up to me and try to arrest me for Disorderly conduct but I crush the windpipe of one officer with straight tiger style strike at his throat. He falls to the floor struggling to breathe and I grab his radio and crush his skull. The other officer jumps on me and I flip him over and he falls to the floor and I stab him in the eye with my pen. He is blinded and starts to scream and I take out my knife and slice his throat.  I slice open his pants and grab the keys and open the trunk to the cop car. I throw them both in and drive to hunts point to my friends Food warehouse. I remove the officers clothing and leave them naked. I  throw both officers in their incinerator which burns rotting food and human flesh alike. I then drive the car about six blocks away to the junk yard and have them crush the car and bury it under 5000 other cars.   How did I get to that all within 2 mins???  What actually happened was me getting out of my car and walking around and asking the cop politely if he can move his car for I can leave. He obliged and on my merry way I went.  I could have just went home but I had to leave instead of coming to my house and festering a deeper hatred of what we in the street call overseers. In my travels, a memory of a true story was triggered by the previous incident. In 1991 in my old neighborhood I was harassed by some officers to leave the corner ( our usual hanging spot ) or upon their return they will arrest us. They gave us ten minutes and they departed. They lied to me and came back in five mins. When they walked up to me and told me to put my hands behind my back ñ my ghetto rebellious ass refused. I said I didnít d anythng and I was going home. 4 officers and one Sargent threatening me with arrest for just standing in a corner was not my idea of justice nor policing the neighborhood. 3 officers started grabbing me and a light scuffle between us ensued. The Sargent at this time comes straight into my face and says in what I guess he considered a low threatening growl..... ì If you donít stay still, you will go to the hospital instead of the precintî. I look at him and everything that I hated in my life resonated and morphed in his face. I told him ì what are you going to do??? You are going to hit me??? You are a.........î Before I even finished that sentence he cocked back his hand and smacked me right across my face that made everything I believed in questionable.  2 seconds after I got smacked I came back with every ounce of anger, hatred and reasoning that I could muster in the form of a right hook across his nose. Bench pressing 245 at that time, semi-pro football conditioning, enough fights to know where to hit to knock you out all equaled a complete and utter knockout of the Sargent. The other cops let me go to tend the Sargent that hit the floor somewhat similar to a ton of chopped and graded liver. Did I run ?Did I attempt to make a break for it? Nope. I stood there against the wall and my point was made. You hit me ñ I hit you back.    My block started getting crazy with everyone screaming. A couple of bottle came flying and before things got out of hand and anyone else got hurt, I let them handcuff me and take me.  The precint is about a 10 minute walk from my old block and when I got there the cops were gun ho to charge me with everything under the sun.   ìwhatís your name? Get me a lawyer  Where do you live? Get me a lawyer  How old are you? Get me a lawyer  Do you realize you are getting a definite 7 years for hitting that officer?? Get me a lawyer  1 hour into my arrest and my lawyer shows up with about 40 people from my neighborhood saying that he hit me first and all I did was protect myself.  In the holding room the officer walk in with his eyes swollen and readily turning a slight shade of purple.   ì you think you are a wiseguy huh?î ì I am not the one with two black eyesî ì I could make you disappear if I wanted toî ì no, you can attempt to make me disappear, doesnít mean it will happenî ì What makes you such a badass?î ì I have heart unlike most of youî  He comes up to me and at this time I feel pretty fucked because I am handcuffed with no way of protecting this pretty face.   ì you a man? take these cuffs off. If not, the streets will be a level playing fieldî  Eye to eye....... he walks out. I was charged with Disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. The assault on a police officer never came into play.  One thing for sure, years later and I still get respect from the older officers from around the way. They all knew I never hustled or did dirt. I was just a neighborhood dude with a short fuse.  Yesterday was kinda a test of that short fuse. I met up with a friend late night and I parked in a handicapped zone while she and I talked in her job. Sure enough, a cop comes and he give me a ticket for parking in the zone. I was wrong for parking there but the ticket was for 180 dollars!! That shit almost made me lose my mind. I barely have two nickels to rub together and this ticket was 180 dollars!!!! I called my homegirl when I was 10 mins from my house and beef. She got in contact with the officer (he works in that area which is a movie theater) and he tells her if I can come back, he could take care of it.I had to turn around and trek back to the BK to have him somewhat alter the ticket. So here is the duality of the situation: I despise almost anything or anyone with the label of Authority in NYC. Yet, this cop got me out of this 180 dollar ticket.  If my homegirl has to give him ass, so be it.  I donít have to pay 180 and that was the only thing I was happy about.  Does this cop have the power to change my views on everything ìCOPî. Nope! It just made my views stronger that many if not all cops are pieces of shit. He went against his rules and doctored my ticket. This means many other cops are out there bending and breaking the rules when they see fit.  FUCK DA POLICE!!  Other then that ......  Highlights of my evening  -	Getting a new radio in my house. I HAVE MUSIC -	Going to the nuyo by myself and seeing DX21 and Augustus do well -	meeting a female poet named JOJO that heard about what we do and she loves it -	coming home and staying up until 6am fixing things in my house for the superbowl party -	listening to music -	talking really in depth with Rich. That motherfucker is moving up and I am so happy for his Monkey ass   Let me run  Peace  Fish

      I never gave it much thought until seeing the article. The first show of 2004 was a doozie and we even had a NY Times reporter in the house taking notes. The article falls under the umbrella of ARTS in the Bronx but a decently crafted story was about Acentos. First UTNE ( Mad Love to Tony BRown ) and now the NY Times.  I threw in the link for you can read the whole article. Below is the immediate blurb about us at what we call home.  ***************************************************** Arts activity is hardly limited to the two square blocks around Hostos. Ten blocks south Aronne Baietti, a commercial fisherman by trade, opened the Blue Ox on Third Avenue and 139th Street a little more than a year ago to serve a growing group of local professionals looking for a place to kick back. Today the bar still provokes pedestrian double takes. It looks completely out of place, as if some tornado had swept it off the Upper East Side and planted it in the Bronx.   But on the inside it's just a friendly watering hole that serves inexpensive mixed drinks and questionable frozen pizza. The bar holds poetry readings on Bronx Culture Trolley nights, and two Tuesdays a month it is taken over by the Acentos Poetry Series. Despite the name, which means "accents" in Spanish, the work is mostly in English with a few Spanish terms thrown in.   Acentos always has a headliner - the first January event featured Hector Rivera of the Welfare Poets - but the meat of the evening was the open-mike session, where more than a score of poets read and performed before a friendly, encouraging crowd of 40 (half of whom, of course, were poets themselves).   The performer to make the strongest impression called himself Harlym 125, a teacher by day who gave a loud, fiery discourse about the state of urban education that, were it not so coherent, would have qualified as a rant. Everyone took a hit - from President Bush, an easy target in this crowd, to teachers who do not take action to change the fate of their students, an admonition that may have resonated with some participants.   "That was dope, dude," said Oscar Bermeo, the show's master of ceremonies, after raucous applause. "The next time, more intensity, a'ight?" Mr. Bermeo, whose organization, louderARTS, holds similar events downtown, said later that the site makes the event: "If we did the same thing in Manhattan, we'd probably have two or three times the crowd. But it's not about that. It's about the opportunity to say, `Yo, I read in the Bronx.' "   ****************************************** Peace  Fish    urlLink Acentos in the NY Times

      Don't even ask about the subject header!!!!   What do you get when you have a room full of poets breaking bread and enjoying each others company? The most minimal poetry talk possible! Yesterday was a one of those days where you realize that your weird poet friends are actually pretty cool. I've noticed within our venerable bunch, we have rappers, storytellers, quiet folk, loud folk, and plain weird folk.  Makes me kinda tingly to knowing these people are cool to be with. Dare I say funny as all bloody hell sometimes too. From the Trinny lady that chopped off her dreads to a optimal orgasm from the newly minted sex toy called " the tingler ", too much to even think about.  I always felt breaking bread with poets/ friends/ or anybody has always been a much more calm and relaxed atmosphere. Matter a fact - I will propose the next meeting of the minds over some food. For years I have always had a kick with going out to eat. Give me some food and I am good. When I meet someone and I feel they are worthy to go out, dinner is usually the protocol.  Back in 1992 when I got hurt, I came out of the hospital after a 33 day stint and called every single person that came to visit me. I would pick them up and take them to a variety of different places to eat.  IF you think you know me-realize how many people I know. Do you think I know alot of people now?? I have always prided myself in keeping contact with the world that comes in contact with Fish. After spending my savings in treating people to dinner, my EX girlfriend was pissed. I wasn't working at that time ( because of the injury) and I had ample time on my hands. So, I went out to dinner every night for a straight 7 weeks. 80 bucks per dinner on average..... you do the math. At least every person knew how much  I appreciated them coming to see me. If that was to happen now....... Expect a Thank you Poem.  Everything is going pretty good these days.  No complaints as of yet.  Peace, Love, Pokchops.  Fish

      So, should I talk about the doom and gloom of this fuckin weather? It wasn't that bad but I made my life a living hell last night.  Let me try to go in order. Last night was our little thing called Acentos.  With about 10 inches of snow readily to be dropped on the blue Ox itself- we still had a crowd. How in the fuck do people come out with such bad weather is beyond me. I don't leave my house even when it rains let alone snow.   Acentos was pretty cool last night. I think all I really liked was the feature. She seemed to be having fun up there and it made me feel good. When she featured at Bar 13 a couple of months back, she seemed really up-tight. Last night the comfort level was there. There were some things that ticked me off but we will recitify them down the road.   Leaving there last night was the mission. I had to go and pick up some things for the SuperBowl Party on Sunday. I know that I had issues in driving but doing needless driving was pushing it. The snow and ice was freezing on my wipers and the only thing getting wiped down were the beads of sweat off my forhead from the typhoon of nerves within me. I stopped several times to wipe the windows down and try to make it easier to see. After I dropped my cranky lenny off, I headed home and I am so happy I got a parking spot. Even though this morning my Dad took the car to work - I am glad I had a spot.  At least this morning I got to sleep late. When I called in and found out the company was open, I stretched and went back to sleep. I knew no one would come in today so I didn't rush at all.   Got here around 10:30 and here is about 4 people here.  Gotta love the snow and all these white people living in the burbs.  Peace

      yea...it's one of those days. I didn't get to sleep at a decent hour. Sometimes I wonder why I stay up when I know I will regret it the next morning. I am ok but I have that weak and tired thing going on and it is not fun.  Yesterday was a good day. If you all haven't heard nor seen - Lynne ( Big Mama Procope ) is bald. She has taken the bold step of shaving her head down to a tawdry cue-ball.  I saw her on Sunday and I was genuinely shocked and awed into a " Holy shit". It looks cool and I do commend her on taking one of the boldest steps. After growing dreads for 7 plus years and you just cut them off - that makes you brave in my book.  Bar 13 was ok yesterday. Andrea Gibson was our feature and she was pretty good. Oh man, why am I even going to say this??? Dare I ?? She sounded to slammy at some points. One thing that I have learned over the year or two in this game is:     1        If you are feature, you don't have to rush through a piece. Take your time and make sure the audience gets to hear every word.  2         Engage your audience and treat them to your hard work.   She did look kinda nervous up there but I think she did ok.  I have noticed that I have leaned towards the features that read calmly and go through their pieces very methodically. When a poet reads and I feel every word coming out of their mouth has meaning, then I am hooked. This is why I have paid so much attention to the greybeards and old slam farts. These are merely the descriptions they have used - not me. I don't think I would ever see Taylor screaming and moving his mouth a 50 MPH.  Lynne also can rock the house with extremely well crafted poetry. No gimmicks, No jumping up and down, no ranting, no speed talking. Just you in front of the microphone reciting some images that will make an audience cry. That is what it is all about.  Wow - I guess the 2003 " Dance " debacle that L.A did throw out there was nothing great.  Tonight is Acentos is this is our home. I hope to see you kats out there in full support. It is going to be a blast.  Peace, Love, Pork Chops

      To take a page off Rich's Surreal moments of my life.............  On Saturday I get a phone call from Lois ( Nuyorican Director of sorts ) and she tells me they have had several cancellations at the Nuyorican. My first thougt is "ok". Then she proceeds to tell me about how she would love for me to produce a show there on Feb 11 from 7-9. Now guys, producing a show takes time and energy. Energy is not a problem - time has always fuckin escaped me.  Anyway - She tells me starting in April we can have a weekly spot at the Nuyorican to do whatever we want.  I was on the computer with Rich and we were both metaphorically jumping up and down.   In trying to do good for my community at large. I gave it some thought and I wanted to have Ray's series come back to a good life.  I want to concentrate on Poetry but I want the experimental collaborations to come into play. SynonymUS is a good format but I think it could be better and dare I say a friendlier format for the first timer. So in keeping with my selfless acts of kindness - The first event will be billed as a barometer for the weekly events to come.   Oh folks, don't get it twisted.... Acentos gets top billing.   Acentos presents.........   SynonymUS blah blah blah  " a homage to nuyorican poetry  That is the general idea that I have in mind. You can come and read your poetry acapella or with Ray and his musical tinklings. Either a poem of yours or paying homage to Pinero, Pietri, Perdomo, Cruz, Espada, Esteves or whoever you would like to read. I want to see an energetic evening filled with poetry, music, singing and life. The best part about this is we get the NUYO right before the Wed open slam. We get to promote everything else that we have going on.  Acentos has been said to bring the "Nuyo" back in NuyoRican poetry. With a foot in the door at the NUYO RICAN...... Acentos is taking over. Point, period, punto.  So Feb 11 is our First event and we will have a newsletter today.   Big Things  Big Dawg  Big Fish   Peace, Love, Poetry

      When I first took reins in Rikers Island I gave a speech that was considered rather abnormal for a classroom setting.    ì How we doing? Thanks for coming here today. My Name is Samuel Vargas. Most likely you will never hear that full name again uttered in this class. My nickname is Fish and I prefer to be called just that ñ Fish. To get to this quickly ( put my hand in the air)..........  1 ñ I am not getting yaíll shit 2- Donít ask me for shit that does not deal with poetry 3- Favors donít exist  If you have the urge to ask me for anything that borders on the illegal, refrain from doing so because there is no chance. Letís get right into itî     I always felt the need to say that speech because I am there to teach poetry and make sure these kats walk out with a feel of what true poetry is.  The program that I am dealing with is in total disarray as we speak. One of the big wig chics was mesmerized by the power of the ghetto magic stick and did everything she told me I COULDNít DO! This is what is wrong with people. They preach and sermon and do the wrongs in their long drawn out soliloquies.  Bringing cigarettes to a correctional facility is throwing fuel on the fire as they say. After you bring cigarettes, you are asked to bring alcohol. After that , you are asked to bring anything and everything that can be considered contraband.   In dealing with the correctional system from both sides- shit is still fucked up. We have had opportunity upon opportunity to bring things to Rikers that would make the normal person blush. As a teacher, you are granted this status of trust and it is scary of what you can do. I have walked into Rikers with my Knife everytime. I have walked in with my cell phone, pager, 2 way. What else can I get on there with??? Anything with no problem. I chose to keep a clean nose for the simple reason of not giving a chance to these inmates. They have made mistakes and are paying for it with their freedom and granted that is not an easy task- this is what they were dealt. There is also the little factor of once you do it - you are more then likely stuck in a circle where you have to do it again and again.  As a visitor of the correctional system, you have the right attitude and words to go with it and you are ok. You can have everything from fast food to whatever amenity your meterosexual ass missed on the outside.  Teaching at Rikers gives you a good outlook on life. Why??? You get to go home. I havenít had much experience teaching so I rarely ever use that title of teacher. There is a huge difference between teaching and running a workshop. Even though I will be finishing this Community word project teaching program and I will be a bonafide ì teaching artistî. Whatever the fuck that means at least I will have a feeling of accomplishment.   Rikers hasnít been easy this year. I am dealing with the behind the scenes of administrative chores and also trying to get my teaching time in. I was also in charge of three instructors that came with me to run these workshops. I wasnít too keen on policing them simply because I am not qualified. The fellas ( inmates )  have all had glorious reviews of them and that makes me happy. I hope that next term will be just as good. I even invited some of inmates that are being released to consider coming back and giving their time as volunteers to the program. Nothing would send a more positive message to the next round of class then seeing former inmates in a constructive role.  We see.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      Who remembers waking up early Saturday and Sunday morning without your mothers chancleta wacking you upside the head to go to school? The Saturday morning cartoons were a staple in most of the 30 year old geriatric farts that we call poets.  We didn't have Nick at Night or that cartoon Channel shit. We didn't have Sponge Bob Squarepants ( Who is flammingly gay I might add) or the new porno star known as Bob the builder. We had Voltron, G.I Joe, Transformers, Bugs Bunny, Smurfs, and an array of other cartoons that made growing up in the 70's a pleasure.   Well, this is kind sad....  Remember this kat on the right?    Good ol Captain Kangaroo. The guy has a real name but to me, it doesn't matter. Today...... He died at 76. I always thought he was much older then that . First Mr Rogers and now the Captain. Those Magic Garden chics better be careful.

      wow.  I have seen several venues over a year or two with a slight tendency to stretch the truth. Here is a scale to give you an idea:  5+ People = intimate crowd 10+ people = nice crowd 20+ people =good crowd 30+ people = great crowd 40 +people = awesome crowd 50+ people = incredible crowd 60+ people = Oh My God  Sometimes you can patronize a venue and you and the bartender are bonding over a host and three of his friends that have read the same poem for 6 years.  This would fall in the country of ìintimateî. Yet, the next day........ the host will send out and e-mail to his group listing of over 500 people.  ì Oh My God!! Last night was the most incredible night of poetry that we have ever see. Wall to wall people with a jam packed open micî  They havenít seen more then six people in the same room in several years.  Now, I am not saying anything ñ Iím just saying. In the interest of you scratch my back and I will scratch yours, I still have to keep it real.  Fish

      .......nothing is impossible - shoot for the stars. This is how I felt  last night after seeing a fundraiser several steps above most expectations. Standing room only with an across the board love for a poet that has undoubtedly touched everyone there.  Yesterday was perfection in my book.  As I was optimistic this fundraiser would be better then the first and second one combined - I was almost right. Karen and I took on this thing with vigor, fervor, even a little added animosity. I say this because some of the older people might have more love for one of their own but we can make it happen. Regardless, I think Karen handled the night with grace and she is quickly becoming on of my Favorite poets behind Guy and Eric(g).  Blown away by some poets with a mix of emotions and joy, I didn't know where to stand. I was walking around with my nerves making my muscles twitch. Greeting Martin Espada and Jack Agueros outside and having them know who I am was mindblowing. Then.......sitting on the stage while espada read "en la Calle San Sebastian" did something that never happened to me before....  500 e-mails Over 1 hundred phonecalls on my cell phone Confirmations Cancellations Thank you hugs Pictures Poetry Love  .......yesterday.. I cried. I cried for Pedro. I cried for me. I cried for everything that has made this life so good. I cried on the stage while Espada read a poem that touch me so hard that it took everything within me not to crawl up into the fetal position and give thanks to whatever deity is looking over me. Whatever little thing that made my mind click and say " Poetry is your life" - I thank that moment.  I don't think one person on this scene can say anything bad about me or what I stand for. What it is???  Unity. Unity as one large NYC Poetry fuckin community  I feel a connection between Bowery, Bar 13, Nuyo, Soundz, Cheyyenne, Cornelia, Julia Deburgos, Carlitos, Amy Ruth's, hottest Poets. Granted..... I have my differences in the caliber of poetry but they all know that I have love for them.  Under the circumstances... there is a positive.   To take  words out of Martin......  " I have a dream. I have a dream that one day NYC will hold Nationals in the most exciting city in the United States.  This might not happen today nor next year. I promise you that either alive or dead - Nationals will be held in NYC. It is possible and no one can tell me otherwise.  Fish ( Pumping his fist in the air) Dawg

It has turned into more of a social tool to get more points as to who has the best blog, most entertaining blog, deep blog, funniest blog.

      Happy New Year to all my Chinese brothers and sisters out there. Even though the closest chinese friend I have is on my shit list - I can still say Happy new Year. I gathered some facts for all of the Stalkers that haven't a clue about new years.   Peace    Chinese New Year starts with the New Moon on the first day of the new year  and ends on the full moon 15 days later. The 15th day of the new year is called  the Lantern Festival, which is celebrated at night with lantern displays and  children carrying lanterns in a parade.     The Chinese calendar is based on a combination of lunar and solar movements.  The lunar cycle is about 29.5 days. In order to "catch up" with the solar  calendar the Chinese insert an extra month once every few years (seven years out  of a 19-yearcycle). This is the same as adding an extra day on leap year. This  is why, according to the solar calendar, the Chinese New Year falls on a  different date each year.   New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are celebrated as a family affair, a time  of reunion and thanksgiving. The celebration was traditionally highlighted with  a religious ceremony given in honor of Heaven and Earth, the gods of the  household and the family ancestors.   The sacrifice to the ancestors, the most vital of all the rituals, united the  living members with those who had passed away. Departed relatives are  remembered with great respect because they were responsible for laying the  foundations for the fortune and glory of the family.   The presence of the ancestors is acknowledged on New Year's Eve with a dinner  arranged for them at the family banquet table. The spirits of the ancestors,  together with the living, celebrate the onset of the New Year as one great  community. The communal feast called "surrounding the stove" or weilu. It  symbolizes family unity and honors the past and present generations.   *****************************************   The 15-Day Celebration of Chinese New Year     The first day of the Lunar New Year is "the welcoming of the gods of the  heavens and earth."Many people abstain from meat on the first day of the new  year because it is believed that this will ensure long and happy lives for  them.On the second day, the Chinese pray to their ancestors as well as to all the  gods. They are extra kind to dogs and feed them well as it is believed that  the second day is the birthday of all dogs.     The third and fourth days are for the sons-in-laws to pay respect to their  parents-in-law. The fifth day is called Po Woo. On that day people stay home to  welcome the God of Wealth. No one visits families and friends on the fifth day  because it will bring both parties bad luck.     On the sixth to the 10th day, the Chinese visit their relatives and friends  freely. They also visit the temples to pray for good fortune and health.         The seventh day of the New Year is the day for farmers to display their  produce. These farmers make a drink from seven types of vegetables to celebrate the  occasion. The seventh day is also considered the birthday of human beings.  Noodles are eaten to promote longevity and raw fish for success. On the eighth  day the Fujian people have another family reunion dinner, and at midnight they  pray to Tian Gong, the God of Heaven.             The ninth day is to make offerings to the Jade Emperor. The 10th through  the 12th are days that friends and relatives should be invited for dinner.  After so much rich food, on the 13th day you should have simple rice congee and  mustard greens (choi sum) to cleanse the system.   The 14th day should be for preparations to celebrate the Lantern Festival  which is to be held on the 15th night.    *****************************************   House Cleaning The entire house should be cleaned before New Year's Day. On  New Year's Eve, all brooms, brushes, dusters, dust pans and other cleaning  equipment are put away. Sweeping or dusting should not be done on New Year's Day  for fear that good fortune will be swept away. After New Year's Day, the floors  may be swept. Beginning at the door, the dust and rubbish are swept to the  middle of the parlor, then placed in the corners and not taken or thrown out  until the fifth day. At no time should the rubbish in the corners be trampled  upon. In sweeping, there is a superstition that if you sweep the dirt out over  the threshold, you will sweep one of the family away. Also, to sweep the dust  and dirt out of your house by the front entrance is to sweep away the good  fortune of the family; it must always be swept inwards and then carried out, then  no harm will follow. All dirt and rubbish must be taken out the back door.            Bringing In the New Year and   Expelling the Old Shooting off firecrackers on New Year's Eve is the Chinese way of sending out  the old year and welcoming in the New Year. On the stroke of midnight on New  Year's Eve, every door in the house, and even windows, have to be open to  allow the old year to go out.       New Year Activities Set Precendent All debts had to paid by this time.  Nothing should be lent on this day, as anyone who does so will be lending all the  year. Back when tinder and flint were used, no one would lend them on this day  or give a light to others. Everyone should refrain from using foul language and  bad or unlucky words. Negative terms and the word "four" (Ssu), which sounds  like the word for death, are not to be uttered. Death and dying are never  mentioned and ghost stories are totally taboo. References to the past year are  also avoided as everything should be turned toward the New Year and a new  beginning. If you cry on New Year's day, you will cry all through the year.  Therefore, children are tolerated and are not spanked, even though they are  mischievous.           Personal Appearance and CleanlinessOn New Year's Day, we are not suppose  to wash our hair because it would mean we would have washed away good luck for  the New Year. Red clothing is preferred during this festive occasion. Red is  considered a bright, happy color, sure to bring the wearer a sunny and bright  future. It is believed that appearance and attitude during New Year's sets the  tone for the rest of the year. Children and unmarried friends, as well as  close relatives are given lai see, little red envelopes with crisp one dollar  bills inserted, for good fortune.    More New Year SuperstitionsFor those most superstitious, before leaving the  house to call on others, the Almanac should be consulted to find the best time  to leave the home and the direction which is most auspicious to head out.The  first person one meets and the first words heard are significant as to what the  fortunes would be for the entire year. It is a lucky sign to see or hear  songbirds or red-colored birds or swallows.It is considered unlucky to greet  anyone in their bedroom so that is why everyone, even the sick, should get dressed  and sit in the living room.Do not use knives or scissors on New Year's Day as  this may cut off fortune.While many Chinese people today may not believe in  these do's and don'ts, these traditions and customs are still practiced. These  traditions and customs are kept because most families realize that it is these  very traditions, whether believed or not, that provide continuity with the  past and provide the family with an identity.

      Last year around this time I was wetting my feet in the slam scene. I was slamming on a more then rare basis and I was always nervous as holy fuck about it.   At this time was my famous "freezing" moment at the NUYO. I froze twice during the poem and was traumatized  from there on out. Segue onto the next slam and the story plays like this.  I tell Oscar that I want to slam on Monday regardless of the debacle that I just went through at the Nuyo. All week I was memorizing my "Yo Soy del Bronx" piece and I wanted to bust it from memory. As Oscar was trying to tell me that the piece is longer then three minutes, I was sure my piece was under the dreaded time limit.   Come Monday and I proudly get up there and "spit". Four minutes and twenty five seconds later and I was done.  It sucks folks.... the time penalty brought me down to a stinging 22.  I knew the piece was long but not to the point where it would kill me. At that time I went first and got the highest score in the first round but that time penalty sucks ass. Lenny brought me  a stop watch and I haven't gone over since!  Moral of the story?? Diane, buy a fuckin stop watch! That skinny west coast chic needs a stop watch engrained in her forehead.   I don't think there is one viable excuse for a seasoned veteran to go over the time limit. I will forgive you forgetting a poem you have done 60 times over before I forgive a time penalty.   The slam was decent yesterday as Celena is making all of Bar 13 competitors her bitches. I love her style and she holds firm with every word that comes from her mouth. RAC killed it and I was happy to see her get some points. Also - my new slam whore Abena has taken the title away from Ray this year.  Ray never slammed until I convinced him that he had what it took. Before you know it- instant whore! Ray slammed at least 5 times last year. Abena has six under her belt and she is solid!!!   I will most likely slam in two weeks and try to get some points.  Fish is leaving the Fish Tank

      ........is a motherfucker. I was in a bad mood yesterday for several reasons. None in which I will even remotely divulge here. I will give mention of a situation I had yesterday with a person that lives in my building.  Let me get to the brunt of the facts that will paint a fair and un-biased picture of this bitch. Ooops... I am already being unfair. Anyway...... My mother has an aquaintance in this building that I really donít quite get along with. Some of the reasons that I donít like her are simple. She loves to boast and brag about her life. She brags about her perfect marriage. She brags about being the perfect woman. She brags about being morally and ethically righteous. This shouldnít be a bad thing but when I clearly can see that it is all under the umbrella of ìbullshitî ñ it gets to me.  Yesterday ñ the pot boiled over. With me being in a bad mood and not readily adept to control my temper ñ it was the perfect combination for a blowout. As I made my sandwiches and wanted to spend some quality time with my parents, her mere presence annoyed me. Her smell, her aura, her breathing ñ everything made my blood curl like spoiled milk. She was looking through a magazine and kept boasting how she was going into the gym to get her body perfected. She wanted to stay in shape to attract a good man. At this time I was pushed to the metaphorical edge and I started.   Fish says...ì what is the purpose of you trying to look good?î Whore says....î I want to look good to get a man to take care of meî  ì you want to look good for a man can take care of you?. How about trying to look good for you?  ì I have to look good because no man wants a fat womanî  ìNo, no man wants to get together with a woman that has excessive baggage from previous relationships ñ let alone three kids from three different fathers.î  Ok guys..... She has three kids from three different baby daddies. This does not bold well with any normal man that walks the face of the NYC dirt trails.  I was being nice at this point and I didnít pull out the big guns.  She saysî Well, I need to find a man that has been in a situation like mines and understands what I have gone throughî  I say ì So  you want to be with a man that has fathered three kids to three different women and refuses to work? From what I see, you refuse to work. What happen to your last job???  She says ì I got fired ì  ìThat explains how bad you want to work. If you got fired, you didnít really want to workî  Ok people ñ the anger was setting in and I decided to pull off the gloves. I was about to give up and walk out with a draw.  Now she pulled her gloves off and mentions.........  ì Well, how about you??? You donít have kids and you donít even have a relationship because no one wants to be with youî  Oh man oh man........ this is were the doozies come out.  I say ì I donít have a relationship because I donít want one. I donít want kids and the mere fact that I donít have them proves that I have been responsible enough to not accidently bring a child into this world.î  ì Unlike you ñ you were married to sergio and boasting in this living room how you are righteous and love the fact that you are married to a good man that takes care of you. You were saying you love sergio but was fuckin martin on the side when sergio was working. You say you left sergio??? no no no.. Sergio left you when martin Got you pregnant! So when you are married and get pregnant from someone other then your husband ñ what does that make youî  She say ñ ì that is my business and that is my problemî  I say ì it becomes MY problem when you come to my parents house and they feed you and your THREE kids. It becomes my problem when you LIE to my mother and tell her that you would pay her for three days of babysitting and she still has yet to see that money.î   She says ë Whatever, I have my life and it is better then what yours will ever beî  I say ì If your life of starving kids and you begging my parents makes your life better then mine ñ you are sad. You boast and brag and you are nothing but a typical puta from the street trying to find some poor schmoe to take care of you. You want to squeeze every dollar out of a manís pocket with a pussy that has been used several times over. You are a typical fuckin sucia. Three kids from three different fathers with several abortions under your belt. Be fuckin smart, at least use condoms.î  She gets up and says ì Who are you to talk to me like that ?î  I say ì I am the man that has worked the same job for 16 years. I am the man that is responsible enough to BE FUCKIN RESPONSIBLE. I am the man that pays MY own bills. I am the man that has the right to say whatever the fuck he wants in HIS parents house. You are a fucking visitor that has pushed my buttons every time you walk through that door. You have your own apartment ñ go there and stay there.  She say ì I am leaving ( with a good amount of tears starting ) I donít need this.   I say ë Now you want to cry?. You know what, real putas donít cry so donít start. You are a professional puta and a sucia that needs to get a job. I donít even want you on welfare because that means that my money takes care of another Puta  de la calle. DO me a favor and get the fuck out of here. Go home and stay the fuck out of here. If I am here, do not walk through the door. I donít need your shit and my parents donít need your shit.  She cries some more and she left. I go to the fridge and pull out a malta and drink it with a smile. My father says ì tu eres locoî. I say ì Por que, because I told her the truth?î  I told my father that he is another hypocrite. He talks shit how he doesn't like her but he cow tows everytime that bitch walks through the door. My mother smiled a little smile when I threw everything on the table that she always wanted to say.   I am the first one to admit it, when I am in a bad mood ñ stay away from me. This was something that was long in the coming and I have no regrets.    Fish

Donations will be solicited throughout the night, at the door, and at bucket by the microphone - all praise the poetry, and pay for it, too!  Hosted by Karen Jaime For more info: Fish@louderarts.com  917-209-4211  Tribute Fundraiser for the Rev Pedro Pietri III info at nuyoricanhostess@hotmail.com  ******Following article is from Juan Gonzalez from the Daily News ****************   'El Reverendo' just not ready to leave pulpit     The sad news spread rapidly this weekend: Pedro Pietri, the king of Latino poetry in this town for more than 30 years, is suffering from inoperable stomach cancer.  And what a hilarious reign it has been.  Usually sporting a long black overcoat and a black bowler, with scraggly shoulder-length hair and mustache, Pietri, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1944 and served in the Vietnam War in 1967-68, sarcastically calls himself El Reverendo, the minister of the fictional Church of the Mother of All Tomatoes.  A typical Pietri poetry reading is somewhere between a vaudeville act and a Pentecostal revival. His audiences are erupting in laughter one moment and fighting back tears the next.  For those of us who came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, Pietri's epic "Puerto Rican Obituary" - with its evocation of "nervous breakdown streets/ where the mice live like millionaires/ and the people do not live at all" - still remains the single most powerful expression of the Latino diaspora in this country.  Other Pietri poems, like "Suicide Note from a Cockeroach in a Low-Income Housing Project" and his extended series of "Telephone Booth" verses have been acclaimed as first-rate examples of urban street poetry and forerunners of today's rap or slam contests.  Pietri's prolific production includes more than 20 books of poetry and plays. His work has been translated into several languages.  His last performance was Nov. 8 at Town Hall, where he participated in the 30th-anniversary celebration of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the cultural center he founded on the lower East Side with playwrights Miguel Pinero and Miguel Algarin.  Three days after the Town Hall event, Pietri fell ill.  "First I couldn't hold down any food," Pedro told me yesterday.  "Then I couldn't hold down liquids. But being a hardhead, I thought it was just stomach ulcers. I didn't want to accept the truth."   He finally checked into Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, where doctors discovered a malignant tumor and immediately performed surgery. But by then the tumor had spread to his stomach.  Cancer is the latest and most serious of the physical maladies Pietri has confronted over the past few years.  Some, he is convinced, were caused by exposure in Vietnam to the herbicide Agent Orange.  "When I was in the infantry in Vietnam, we used to see the planes spraying us with that stuff all the time," Pietri recalled.  For the first 20 years after his return from the war, his health was fine.  "Then all of a sudden I came down with glaucoma, then with a bunch of skin diseases and now this cancer," he said.  His doctors are recommending radiation and chemotherapy to attack the tumor, but Pietri, always the cynical rebel, has rejected their approach.  "They did what they could, but I don't want that radiation or to have them just cutting me up again," he said.  Instead he has decided to seek alternative medical treatment next month in Tijuana, Mexico, a procedure his health insurance carrier refuses to cover.  So last week his family and his friends at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe quickly established a benefit fund to pay for Pietri's treatment in Mexico. They are asking anyone who has enjoyed his poetry to come to his aid now.  Those wishing to help can send a contribution to the ÖÖ.   Pedro Pietri Health Benefit Fund,  c/o Nuyorican Poets Cafe, P.O. Box 20794,  New York, N.Y.  10009.   "I'm not giving up. I'm going to kick this thing," Pietri said yesterday.  All those young Latino poets hoping to pick up the king's mantle will just have to wait, because Pedro is feeling too good to check out right now.   Woke up this morning  feeling excellent,  picked up the telephone  dialed the number of my  equal opportunity employer  to inform him i will not  be in to work today.  "are you feeling sick?"  the boss asked me  "no sir," i replied:  "i am feeling too good  to report to work today.  if i feel sick tomorrow  i will come in early!"

      198 hits more and you can bid this Blog " See ya ". I gave it some thought a while back and decided once this blog hits 10,000 hits - it going down baby.  I believe in change and love to start over sometimes. Then again, if I could be convinced - I just might leave it alone.  Yesterday was my first trek to Urbana in one hell of a long time. I haven't been there on a Thursday in a minute. I usually stay home when it is anything under 20 degrees. Yesterday's factors were Tony Brown and..... well..... that's it.  I think the main reasons were  1	he is an awesome poet that I strive to even scratch that surface 2	He always has showed us love ( Acentos) 3	The first time I saw him at 13, I had to buy his book after he blew me away with that voice and use if it.  I had a good time with the open mic being pretty good. The energy of the crowd was really low but can you blame them. It was about 4 degree last night. People usually say " Fish is talking shit, it was not that cold". Well bitches, it was literally 2 degrees when I got home and it was brick. I wasn't cold being layered in several clothes.  I even gave Oscar one of my fleece shirts because I was so well clothed that I was sweating and I needed to find the right amount of clothing to keep me comfy.  Back to Urbana.... Tony got up there and worked through his nerves and displayed what a professional poet does - solid work. He did not rush and read a mix of new and old work.   The slam was cool. I made it much more fun by taking pre-judged scores on all the slammers. It is a fun game and I had a great time. I hope that game doesn't show up at Nats and Marc Smith takes credit for it. I will get ghetto  Well, Nothing going on this weekend. Much needed rest and love for the bed will take priority.   Peace Punks

      If I could have pin pointed the equation which made yesterday's Acentos so great - I would be a happy camper. All I know is when I walked in to a full standing room only Blue Ox  the little tingly feeling came again. Kinda when you are right about to achieve orgasm. You know that feeling of..... I am getting there but it is not the full fledged, hair grabbing, back scratching, top of my lung screaming oragasm. It was something in that area.  What made yesterday's Acentos so nice was even when things were going wrong, we pulled together and made things work. That made it special for me.   The open mic was crazy with 22 some odd people getting to express their feelings with poetry. I took a head count of 62 people total. We also collected a nice pretty penny to donate to the Pedro Pietri Health Benefit fund. It is not much but I want Pedro and the NUYO to know that Acentos cares in more ways then one.  We are helping a legend that is still with us and that is what it is all about.  The thing we call Acentos Kicks off 2004 right. We doing it

      About two days ago, a young Kat was crossing Park ave and 86th street and he was hit by a speeding chevy surburban. He was dragged for one block and his body fell off the truck. He didn't quite make it and died of his injuries.  This made me think about a situation that happen on my block several years ago..........  On my old block where 99% of my poetry comes from we all acted like fools most of the live long day. This varied in different ghetto activities such as throwing Boston baked beans at each other. We made bean shooters, dart shooters out of curtain rods and shoe lace tips, aerosol gas bombs, and tortured everything that was not tied down. We had issues and I don't think any one of us had a conscious to come to think of it.  When we played a retarded game of Catch and smack (Tag), we chased each other around until we caught somebody to smack them across the head and they were it (this was a good incentive not to get caught because the smacks were serious). A young kat I was chasing ran into the street and he didn't see the car coming. The car hit the brakes after hitting this kid and he flew up about 25 feet into the air and landed with a resounding thump that only limp flesh can make a sound like this.  I ran over and the kid was crying and he tried to get up. First thing out of my mouth??? It was not " call an ambulance" or "don't move" or "stop the driver". The first thing out of my mouth was " Are you alright, are you ok?". This kid just got hit by  car and flew like a football that was kicked across to the opposing team.  I think I could have handled the situation better.  That kid is doing life now after killing two dudes for what I consider a stupid reason.   Moral of story:  Don't play Catch and smack in the ghetto

      I was going to go against all my  grains and beliefs and write about politics today.  The whole thing about curious george wanting to go into Iraq even before 9 - 11. Behold, I will go into something better........  I am 33 years old. I can cook, clean, wash my clothes. I am organized and believe in maintaining things in order. I don't throw my socks on the floor and my underwear will always be in tip top shape.   Why in the holy hell fuck do women refuse to do anything remotely domestic???? Women refuse to clean, cook, and sometimes dare I say it........even work! Some want to stay home and be the ultimate trophy wife. Sorry, you are not going to look that good forever. You are going to witness the power of gravity really soon when you nipples and kneecaps become one.  Where is this rant gaining strength from?? This chic in my job and I were having a conversation and she so pompously admitted that she refuses to cook. She let's her husband cook and do dishes. Her laundry gets picked up by her parents to be washed and folded.  Wait, hold on, where is the kicker??? Ready?? She is Pregnant! She is expecting a child and I can't wait until she comes in from those long sleepless nights.  I am just amazed by some standards that some women are living by these days. Don't get me wrong, all housework duties should be shared right down the middle.  A relationship that works together 100% will not have a problem. They will experience difficulties but they will be happy. If one feels that the other should do everything....... 1 in 3 marriages ends in divorce. I am not saying...... I'm just saying.

      There is no reason for NYC to go through this cold weather. I woke up this morning and it was 2 degrees. 2 fucking degrees!!! All the news channels are saying that NYC is experiencing an "artic Blast". No shit sherlock!!   Last night I did my cup project. I place a cup on the outside of my window to see if it would freeze. I know it will freeze, I just like doing it. I might as well turn off my fridge and save the electricity and put all my food outside. It will be nice and cold.  I was suppose to go out to dinner or something with Lenny today but my ass is staying home. I don't think there is any reason why ANYONE should be outside in this cold weather.  Yours in warmth from Casa Pescatore  Fish

      well I am making an attempt to divulge 20 things that no one knows about me- it is pretty hard. It would involve  my pre-poetry days marred with stupidity and a major influx of good luck.  1 - In starting with a stage earlier in my life to keep conformity while bringing it to the present would be easier. I moved to Texas with my parents in 1980. My father was making a pretty penny ( 6 figures ) with a metal fabricating company. The company decided to move to Texas in hopes of finding quality labor at cheaper wages. While down there, all the labor hired were giving out as much as they were getting paid - about 2:45 an hour. The company decided to move across the border to avoid paying U.S taxes and my father refused to go - he lost his job. He drove from Texas to NYC in two days to find an apartment for us to move back to. We moved from a two story house with a backyard pool to a one bedroom apartment.   When I was in Texas, I started the 6th grade and I couldn't read nor do Math. In the 6th grade, I could barely put a sentence or two together. They threatened to hold me back a grade until I was on par with the other students. A private tutor was brought in to asses what I knew and exactly didn't know. Instead of testing me to measure my ability at the typical school stuff, she taught me how to read and how to write. She taught me how to actually like math.  2 - I never wanted to leave Texas but we had  no choice. I moved to a block called Elder Ave and it was interesting. My first day outside I played stickball with the guys from the Block and I did good. My brother gave me a shirt that had "Roger" plastered all over it. They named me Roger until the Moniker "Fish"' was born.  3 - I started going to Junior High School 123. I had to get there early with my Mother to register and spent 5 hours in a room. I was yawning constantly because I couldn't sleep the night before with nerves that kept me up. I was registered and placed in class "8EB". I wore a Button down shirt with a tie and a cardigan sweater with khaki pants. I had viking walkers on my feet and every sentence was always punctuated with "yes sir" or "no ma am". I was the most polite kid in that school.   4 - After receiving several beatings in that school, I slowly started to change and run with what all the other kids were doing. I went from being polite to completely cursing out teachers. I spent most of my time Playing tag and round-up in the hallways. In the latter part of my 8th grade year an Art teacher named Victoria Woodrow was my first experience with a woman. I spent 90% of my day in her classroom and things happened between her and I. She brought me gifts for all occasions and with every gift came a kiss. I received Gift for every holiday possible. I looked forward to feeling her lips against mines.  5 - I finished JHS 123 and headed over to Adlai E. Stevenson High School. At that time- 1986 in the Bronx  had the worst schools in NYC. Shit, not much difference from today huh? I headed to that school with an open mind and a closed fist. I was trained in a Junior High school that closed down for a year after we left. Now I headed to new ground wear new faces  interspersed  with newer ego's.  I spent a full 4 years at that school. My first three years involved me being very dedicated to my schoolwork. I had to repeat my senior year because I wanted to. I stopped going to class after our little crew "Bellaco" decided not to graduate.   6 - In Stevo (Stevenson), I had my first sexual relationship with this girl named Kathy. She was in my Spanish class and I breezed through that class with her sitting in front of me. When she went to the bathroom one time I was sleeping behind her. I was half asleep and I had my arm over her desk. When she came back she moved my arm and I was surprised that she did that. We started exchanging notes with each other and one thing led to the next. I asked her to be my girlfriend after exchanging notes for three weeks. She agreed and it was collectively agreed upon throughout my school amongst all my boys that she is the ugliest bitch in the school. I had nice Friends.  7 - Kathy and I were both virgins and I lied to her with my extended experience in the sexual shenanigans department. As She and I were in my parents house when they were both away at work - we were attempting the act of love. We were both two 17 year old fools kissing and groping like a daytime soap opera until all the clothes were off. I never got as far as getting the panties off. Once they were off...... I was stuck. I knew that my rather erected penis had to go inside of her but it wasn't as easy as first thought. Even in those days, my rather extensive porno collection didn't exist. When I got on top of her and her legs were still closed, I started pumping away and it wasn't in. At that time I think it was easier to come clean and admit my lack of horizontal mambo engagement. After a look of disgust but an opportunity on the horizon - we finagled a 7 inch penis into one extremely dry vagina. Until this day, I clearly remember the clearest thought in the world......."is this what all the guys talk shot about?". I new when the orgasm was about to hit me because I have jerked off about the population of a solar system already. I pulled out and finished all over my bed. The words that came out of her mouth were " Why didn't you cum in me?" she said. I replied, " well, I am not trying to get you pregnant". I know as Lenny is reading this she is probably saying.... Yep, that is him.  8 - I broke up with Kathy a couple of months later after she said she was pregnant and it was a lie. She fed me some bogus story that she didn't want to lose me but after that ........ I was gone.    9 - After high school, I started a relationship with this little cute Ecuadorian girl. We spent 4.5 years together and I did the worst thing I could possibly do - I fell............ in love...... GASP!!!!!! yes, I gave my fucking heart, being, fiber, spirit and even money to that chic. I can't say alot of bad things about her. I do know that she played me and that was the reason I kicked her to the curb. After almost 5 years of loving her, her family, her friends - she played me dirty. Instead of leaving her right there and then, we went to a local hotel for I can get at least the courtesy of a severance pop ( Last sexual foray ). When we were in the hotel I flipped and destroyed everything. To be honest with you, I wanted to do something that would involved the ending of my life. I know, it was stupid. She was going to live the rest of her life with the vivid image of me blowing my brains out.  Once she promised that we would work it out, I had hope. The next day she told me she gave it thought and realized she couldn't do it. Since she was in the safe confines of her job - she thought she was safe. I couldn't do nothing but I found out the brother of the dude she was playing me with worked in the library. When I was walking out of the library in tears and unbridled anger - I saw the dude. I walked up to him and pulled out my knife. I grabbed him by the back of the neck and shoved the knife in his nose. I pulled out the knife and it ripped his nose with a four inch gash.  10 -  I never looked back to Fatima and moved forward to this girl named Lisa. She was always a good friend and we had a great time together. At the time of my break-up with Fatima- lisa left her man. We were together not even 3 days after I left Fatima. Smell the gunpowder of rebounding???? I stood with Lisa for 4 years. The relationship was great but she was a jealous freak that wanted to place blinders on me when I walked down the street. The relationship was mature and the sex was amazing. She was the first to ever engage in the swallowing of bodily fluid and I was whooped. We broke up once but still hung out every weekend. After I realized that It was time for it to be over - she thought different.  We got back together and moved in with each other. I left the confines of my Bronx Ghetto and moved to Queens. All of this under the umbrella of love. 9 months of Queens life and I had a better time sticking pineapples in my ass.  11 - When Lisa Came home and she wanted to talk. I asked her if it was the break-up speech. She concurred that it was and I told her not to bother because I just gave her mine. She wanted out just as I. She made my life a living fucking hell and I hated her for it. I have this cleaver that I use when I cook and I woke up one time at 3 am and I had the cleaver in my hand. I figured that if I would have chopped her head off and bathed the whole apartment in her blood and screamed that I was the Arch Angel Michael  and I slayed satans angel- I could plead insanity. 9 months in a puzzle factory and I would be able to walk the streets. Shit, hinkley shot a president and he got away with it. Eric called me just when I was walking out of the kitchen with the cleaver. He saved her life.  12 - I left Queens to an Apartment in the Bronx ( Where I am actually still living). I made myself a promise that I will not be with a girl for a year. I needed time for me and I was not going to deal with drama. I started hitting every local club in the Bronx and I bumped into every old friend possible. I used to start partying Thursday night and not stop until Tuesday morning. The after hours were crazy in the Bronx. Big Pun ( Little arms ) used to spit freestyle at all the after hours and that shit was a ball. I used to hate leaving to the bright 11 am morning sun. That shit killed me. I loved the summer time because we could go straight to the beach after the clubs and stay there all day. In my company were almost always girls. I never knew why the girls always loved being with me. I always said it was the big brother thing. Every club I went too, I had all the girls levitate to me. They knew I was there to protect them I guess.  I never had a crush on any of the girls really. They were all young and at the prime of their lives. Yet. this one girl just did it to me. She was young and HOT!!!  I made the mistake of telling Mari and she blabbered.   13 - When I was in my crazy ass moods I used to go with the fellas to the clubs and just bug out with them. I used to have this one line that I pulled out on any unsuspecting female. The line went like this:   " I am not good at rejection so I am going to ask you this just one time - What is your name? " I used to get the most priceless looks from the girls. Here I am looking rather menacing and the girls stutters, stammers, trips and has no clue where to put her face.  14 - I started bouncing at a club called KATS in the BRONX. It was the worst club to go to with the strictest security in any club of NYC. I was solicited to work there after a fight broke out and I slammed this kid head first into a car windshield. I was kinda excited after getting a full 100 dollars for just looking mean. After several hip hop nights and threats from drunk patrons. I decided to start carrying my guns to work. I had a star 45 caliber that held 6 shots with one in the chamber. I also had a Glock 20  40 cal with seventeen in the clip. Did I mention I also had a silencer on it?   15 - At Kats, I saw 7 people get shot, maybe 20 shot at, and 3 fatalities. The worst one was young kid that couldn't get into the club because he was too young. He was outside talking shit and bumped into a dude passing by. The kid was typically loud and took it to the next level by pulling out a gun. The guy was a faster draw and he emptied into this kids face. When the cops came - there wasn't much to identify. I shit you not, they scooped up his brains from the concrete  16 - I got locked up March 26 1998. For some reason, It was a one gun day. I am happy because anything more then that - time was definite. When I was going home after a shooting at the club ( we close early after a shooting) the cops came from behind me and I had no time to do anything. They caught me with a vest and my 40 cal with the silencer. I copped out to 5 years probation but that was after fighting 4 attempted murder charges. They tried to pin a previous shooting with a 40 cal with the same exact bullets  on me. What can I say that no one knows about that?? Two words: Change barrels  17- I played semi-pro football for mad years and that was my therapy. In 1999, the only good thing in my life was going undefeated with the outlaws. We went to the championship as a 5 point favorite and we lost 14-13. I cried on the sidelines after the game and I never got the heart to give that game 100% again. In 2000, I retired from semi-pro   18 - I piggy backed my way onto the poetry scene with Oscar in 2001. I always did it to support him at every thing he did. I always wrote a little bit here and there but I never thought anything of it. One of the earlier experiences I had at Bar 13 was witnessing a slam where Oscar was wetting his feet. I never knew Roger ( dreded at the time ) and I was pissed when I saw him judging but was busier talking shit then listening to Oscar's Voicemail poem. After being here for a a little while, I can understand why Roger wasn't paying Oscar mind.  19 - After going to several open mics and writing more poems - Marty asked me to uppercase at Bar 13. I cried like a baby when  I read that e-mail. I was so scared to look like a piece of shit up there. I worked so hard writing three poems to rip the stage and make everyone happy. I invited ( with threats ) everyone that I knew. I literally cut people off that didn't show up and support me.  I was just heated that we ended the night with some dudes playing some crazy shit. I never got to finish the night strong and until this day it bothered me. I only recently got my redemption at Acentos when I featured in fronts of my Parents.  20 - I am learning to live happy and I am hoping to love.

      Damn, so much love for my birthday. I had an awesome time yesterday. From the phonecalls to the e-mails being crazy. Shit, the guestbook was bumrushed and it felt good too see that much love. Thanks to whomever sent the link to the whole poetry world.   I had an awesome Dinner with Eric, Tom and Oscar and clogged my veins with some red meat. Drove around with Eric and spoke a little bit.  I got home to reflect again......  After I decided to call Lenny and give thanks for an awesome wallet she gave me......I went to bed.  The head hit the pillow and I stared into the ceiling. The smile was plastered across my face. I have good friends, I have great family. Why did my eyes tear?? I am finally happy.  I feel good today. Life is better then good.

      Go fishy, It's your birfday, go Fishy, it's your birfday....... We gonna party for several days because it's your birfday!!!!!  Yes, 33 years ago, my mother took a cab to the hospital while my dad stood home sleeping. Two hours after checking in and going through labor. Three to four pushes later... the Birth of Samuel Vargas Jr was a miracle on earth. My mother hoped for her newly born son to become the greatest President of the United States. Instead, Fish became a Poet. I surpassed her expectations.  Happy Birthday to the FishDawg. For the three or four people that will remember, I will just accept phonecalls and kinda take the day in.I usually take the day off and stay home but I am saving all my days to really take advantage of anything poetic that comes my way this year.  Time to go Work calls  Peace, Love, Go fishy..........it's your Birfday  :)

      Happy Three Kings Day.   Yes, It's that time of the year where most latin oriented countries  celebrate the Three wise kings bringing Jesus Christ Gift. 12 days after Jesus was born, the three kings followed the star of Bethleham to bestow gift on the CHrist Child. So as we latinos celebrate this day by putting Grass under our beds the night before(Jan 5) to feed the camels the Kings would ride in. The next day, you would have a gift under your bed. This is the day where plenty of food and drink goes to the family and a joyous Christmas comes to an end. The tree is taken down on this day but we give thanks to a beautiful and healthy Christmas season and we look forward to a new year.  Happy Three Kings Day once again.  I am really doing well today. Yesterday was the LouderCHAMPION tournament at Bar 13. Damn, I missed that place. It was packed as all holy fuck with some serious standing room only.  A definite good way to start the new year.  The slam started at a good time with Abena, Morgan, Mike Cirelli, Rich, Mahagony Brown, Elana Bell, and Myself ( Fish ).  I was kinda stoked last night trying to be as cool as possible. I worked hard getting ready for this slam and I knew that if my nerves got the best of me, I am going to be a piece of shit in the later rounds.   The first round came up and the order was picked......  Rich Drew Suicide first Morgan got second Mahogany Mike Cirelly Abena Elana  Fish  The first round had to be the solid outing to let the judges know that I was there and I wasn't playing.  For the exception of Rich and his first slot suicide and Elanas time penalty - the rest of us scored hearty 27's and better. I kept track of my score of 27.2 and I felt ok with it. On a side note: I am getting tired of my headlines piece and after this season, it will retire. The second round consisted of a 2 min time period and I hit them with a condensed BRONX piece and I got a 25.6. Is this good to get me to the third round??? I have no clue because keeping score had me stressed and I stopped for my sanity.  The third round consisted of a one minute piece and I pulled out a 30 second Apocalypse and we took a break. Whoop de friggin dooo....... The third round came and I move on with Mahogany and Mike Cirelli.  The nerves were not that bad this time around since I went into my "I hate my Parole Officer " piece. The 5th round was unlimited and I wanted to slow down and give them every single word about how much I love my dad. Mike Cirelli and Mahogany got up there and killed it. Each of them got great scores and I knew that I wasn't coming close to beating them. I was still happy. I made it to the third round after doing this for one year and this being my first official slam season. 5 rounds of poetry and my arsenal held up.  I was at Res last night munching on Chicken wings and I was happy. I seriously made my debut as a contender in this field. No cop outs, no excuses as to why I didn't win. Just more work to become a better writer and performer. Always concentrate on craft and quality of your work and do it for yourself.   My life is good.   FishDawg  2004 LouderCHAMPION THIRD PLACE FINISHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  heehee

      Well, it was really more like hope. I was hoping that a plan came together and it did. Yesterday was the fundraiser for the Rev Pedro Pietri. Oh man, talk about a beautiful turnout yesterday.   Still, I walked into the Bowery Poetry Club and I almost died when It was a Poetic Ghost town. I think I saw Langston Hughes walking around when I got there. I was a little bit paranoid and that translated to aggravation when not many people showed up. Shit, even some of the poets that Bob said were willing to turn up didn't show. Baraka didn't show and I will say it boldly here, Fuck him.  I billed him on the flyers first and he didn't show up. That made my endeavor look bootleg. I tried my best to make this event personable, personal, and heart warming.  It is not everyday that you have a legend in a field that you love needing help. So with my hard work in getting this together, I am helping someone that made life easier for me  We had some of the best people come out to read and it made me feel all tingly inside. Willie Perdomo, Bob Holman, Cheryl Boyce Taylor, Quincy Troupe, Eliot Katz, Tsaurah Litzky, Juan Valenzuela, Jesus Papoleto Melendez and a mirad of other poets all gave praise to the Rev Pedro Pietri.  The donations were flowing beautifully in the bucket by the microphone and the Door.   With the hard work  that many of us put in, Pedro is just a little bit closer to getting treatment in Mexico.  It is all worth it in my book, eyes, and heart.   Thanks to you motherfuckers that were out there for me.   Peace, Love, Pasteles  FishDawg

      I thought I needed a good opening line and I thought that was the best I could come up with. I Think it is snazzy enough.  Happy New Year folks!!!!   As I am holding on to my New Years resolution of posting every three days to make this thing more interesting. I think that people will get tired of hearing......  " Woke up , washed my face, went to work "  So far 2004 has been ok to me. No drama to report but I have encountered some pompous heathens with a need for a serious ghetto pimp slap. Behold, I have controlled my temper and with under 3 fights in 2003, I am shooting for none in 2004.  I wnt to the Bowery on New Years days to take place in a reading with over 200 closet poets. I call these people closet poets because you never see them at a reading, book store, book fair, slam. These are people that stay home and write poetry 24 hours a day  and submit it to every possible publisher on this side of the hemisphere.   Some of the people reading poetry were just out of this world - literally. They were  aliens from the far reaches of the neruda galaxy sector 559 and brought what they thought was Poetry to the mic. Am I hating???? Well, you think of what a poetry reading is. Got it??? ok... Now think of a woman going up there and getting on the mic and screaming like an ape. People that was not a metaphor. She was literally screaming like an ape. For a full three mins, she engaged in some grunts, growls, screeches. I looked at Ngoma and he looked at me, we were like " whoah". That lady is getting the award for the weirdest act of 2004.  After I plugged the Pietri fundraiser and handed out over 500 flyers. I ran out of there faster then if my apartment was on fire. With Oscar in tow, we headed home and had a good time.  I don't know if any of my Blog stalkers read Oscar's blog but he has entered the best post of his BLOG life. Oscar had a really fucked up 2003 and I know he was looking foward to a new year.  2004 will be good for him and many of us alike. Of course, this will be if we all change for the better.  Check out his   urlLink Joint .  Everything is going well on this side of the world. I am practicing for a slam on Monday that will determine if I will rep NYC in South Carolina for the IWPS. I am bringing out the big guns to stay in the loop. I am not really ready to drop my newer work in competition yet. It takes practice and plenty of confidence to take a new piece and use it for a slam.  Practice is easy - confidence is a bitch.  Let me bounce  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fishdawg

      Hello Ladies and Gentleman,  As we are poets we love several things in our lives. One of them are the Oscars and what they really think out at the Academy. As I spoke to Shappy yesterday...... We might as well start a small Oscar pool. I made it as simple as possible.   Below are all the nominations. Pick just the one that you think would win in each category( Make sure you put category plus your pick) and send it back to me via e-mail.  The one with the most correct picks wins.  I was going to say lets play for a couple of bucks but that is not happening this late in the game. So. with your submission if you decide to play...... write a small prize you think would be good for a first place win. I might be able to make something happen. I can donate 4 movie tickets to any National Amusement Movie theater.  It's all in Fun....   I will take ballots right until the start of the Oscars..... after that.... it's too late buddy.!!!!

      I needed a snazzy title so that is the best I could come up with. Not much on the home front to write about. Pops is back home making believe shit never happened. I should just kick him on general principle.  My ass stood  home yesterday for the much needed rest. I got on the computer and engaged in some major foolery with Rich and Oscar. Sometimes it is good to act a fool. I really can't remember much of what was said but I got the new title for my upcoming chapbook " louderHAM - where poetry meets Pernil ". How is that for a snazzy title???   I was kinda looking for someone to come pick me up yesterday to go check out the Passion of Christ because my lazy ass did not want to move the cars. I have the Maxima and the galant and it proves too much to be responsible for two cars. Since no one else owns a fuckin hooptie, I stood home and wrote a little more on my latest rant. I have to add some more and then dissect it.    I am headed to the Bowery today to catch Mike McGee and the semis. I will have the ballots in tow and I will be taking bets by the back of the bar.  I don't know who is in semi's but it better prove interesting. I hate going somewhere to get pissed!  Anywho..... Peace my brotha's and sistas. May the power of grayskull enlighten the force to be with you while making my day to yearn for FREEEEEEEDOMMMMMMM while not being a menace while drinking your juice in the hood at two wong foo, thanks for everything..

      In this edition of Fish Flakes............   1 - my dad has issues 2 - the pool table in which I hate during Acentos but After it is a rather nice thing 3 - Omar is my new fuckin hero 4 - Mike Mcgee is awesome 5 - I can safely say no one at the blue ox bar plays good pool   I have time on my hands and I feel like writing so be warned of the long, arduous, bland entry...... NO! I AM GOD!!  LOL  Yesterday was Acentos and I had a date to pick up "Mighty Mike Mcgee". We both settled on a 6pm meet-up and it seemed firm.  I figured if I leave my house at 5pm sharp, it would give me plenty of time to go pick him up. Well, seems that my father had other plans.   The day before yesterday, my mother went to the Emergency room with a bad earache. She called me to let me know and I told my dad that the cooking would be left up to the men of the household. I came home that day and me and my dad both cooked some Chicken with white rice and beans. Shit, typical Puerto Rican dish. My mother came home with some prescribed drops to just sit on the couch. She was cranky so we paid the lady no mind. I left and made my way to the Red tent in and enjoyed my evening.   I guess the 40 some odd years my mother has cooked every single fuckin day doesn't quite matter to my dad.  He argues with her as to he had to come home and cook after he busted his ass after an 11 hour workday. He threatens my moms that he is leaving her.   So, here I am waiting for my dad to get the car. He does not return home and I knew something was wrong. When I called my mother she broke down and told me about the all night fight of how she was not an " adequate " women for him. Yea pop, after 40 years of marriage and now you come out with this bullshit.   So I had to hit plan " B " and call Rich to go pick up Mike McGee and the Bowery. I didn't want to deal with my dad but I had to go get the car because the music stand was in the trunk.  After several strings were pulled and I picked up my Maxima - I headed to get the Galant. My dad is not happy as we speak because he does not have keys to the maxima and woke up this morning wondering where the car is at? He calls me at 5am asking and I told him the galant is where it is usually parked - on Perry ave where he should fuckin be.   So, that saga will play out on the blog  and I will keep posting until my fingers fall off or I put a bullet in my dad's face.  Oh, don't get it twisted - my father hasn't left my mother because he is scared of what I would do to him if I find out he left her for another women.  Do you think I have a problem beating my father to a pulp after leaving my mother starving with no money to bed some other whore??  We see what happens tonight.  When I get to Acentos and everything is everything... the pool table was there. Oh god, the fuckin pool table right smack in the middle  of the bar. I was pissed cause the owner sold me a fuckin dream about moving it but adapt and overcome right? Well, I got there and tried to move the bar around  to better make us of the room.  Most of the people were all congregated to the front and I was not happy.  I asked for about half of them to shift around to the other side to get more of a "fishbowl" effect. I was not happy and everyone knew it. Jessica was not happy being her first foray into Acentos as a member and dealing with this.  So I am angry and I am trying to keep a good face on for my patrons and make due with this situation.   I am thinking I can get more upset but then comes the orders and I DO NOT TAKE ORDERS FROM PEOPLE. If you want anything DONE - pick your ass up and do it yourself.  We all have a job and we all do it well. After much hoopla......  The show started and I played hype man.  As Rich always says and I hold this to him everytime " Everything will play itself out". That is what it sure did.   We had a short open mic as we tried to keep it to 13 people. OF course I know it went over 13 but I am not the one that has to deal with people if they get called out.  The open mic was mixed with new, vets, and national slam champs. Wait...... did you just read that ??? NATIONAL INDIVIDUAL SLAM CHAMPIONS! The mighty Mike Mcgee graced the Acentos mic with a mini feature and it was one of those surreal Rich Villar moments.  I am so glad that I met this guy on Friday at the Nuyo. Not only is he a genuinely nice guy, I am really digging his poetry.  He got the Class "A " Acentos treatment and it was well deserved as we treat every poet with class.  HOLD ON........ not to be outdone - F Omar Telan was our feature. Holy shit. I am in love with Omar. If I was to get locked up and had a choice who I wanted to be my bitch - I have a choice of Ray, Roger, Oscar, and now I have to add Omar.   He is insane and his poetry brings a new definition to "keeping it real" His set had me laughing , shocked, surprised. He had one poem about killing white euro trash people that made me really happy.  Reason being the owner of the Blue Ox had me pissed with this pool table shit and I couldn't really give him the finger and yell fuck you and your bullshit bar. Last night, I lived vicariously through Omar's poetry. Don't get it twisted, when that race war comes and I have to go kill white people...... well, you know. F Omar was an awesome feature and I am glad he has issues just like me.  We finished the show and everything was pretty tight considering our newly placed obstacle. After some general networking here and there - I packed up the merch table ( pool table ) and got on the microphone and said this..........  " I am formally issuing a challenge to a game of pool to Guy Lecharles Gonzalez to redeem my lost in Amhearst Mass. "  The owner gave me a game on the house ( Ok, maybe I won't kill him ) and I racked my first game at the blue ox bar.  Most games are usually won by a mistake an opponent makes. Guy's first mistake was letting me break. He never had a chance. after I sunk three low balls and ran 3 right after.  I let him shoot several times but it was just a form of Chinese pool table torture to let your opponent think they have a chance of winning.  8 BALL CORNER POCKET AND I WAS REDEEMED!!!!! My arch nemesis was defeated at the hand of a semi-pro pool player turned poet.  Oh yea - I went semi-pro in pool and was about one pubic hair away from going pro.  Put it this way, pro pool players are rated a 9 in nine ball.  I was rated an 8. Got the point? Good.  After Guy's slaughter and gauged what little competition I had and played a straight 8 games. As my exit of the Blue ox Bar with an 8 - 0 record, I walk undefeated, undeterred, accomplished, and extremely horny. I forgot how much I loved playing pool.  Yea yea yea, I could see the jokes... Fish likes playing with balls and sticks. Whatever - get it out of your system.  Good day today.......  I am GOD!!!!!  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      This is what I call the free write entry with no care for grammar structure or anything else. I do this because I barely have time to think with this move in my job.  We have this huge move in which we are moving employees around to make better use of the room in our space.  Anyway...... really quick. Last nights new format of "raise the red Tent" was actually kinda hot. I got there a little bit late but in time for the feature.  I wasn't too keen on seeing the feature since it's been someone that I has been on the scene and I am privy to see new work and new faces featuring on our stage.  When someone gets on the stage and they go beyond your expectations to making you feel stupid for having those previous thoughts - it's insane.  Dawn Saylor was the first feature of  "Raise the Red tent". Don't even ask me to explain because it will give me a headache if I get into it.  Anywho - dawn got up there and she left what only we all can wish for.  She started with a great collabo with her main (and only) squeeze Taylor Mali. She then went into some of the most awesome poetry that I have heard in a long time. She had one poem called the Janice years that left me stupid. She was honest, she was open, she was vulnerable, she was insightful, she was crafted closest to perfection that I have seen in a while.   After her feature she was interviewed with a few choice questions from Elana and Obena ( abena ). She explained her life in NY ( suffering ) and Kalamazoo.  She explained her view of " Who am I to tell anybody that their poetry is Bad?". She gained mounds and mounds of respect from me last night. Her feature post, her poetry, her as a person made me happy to say...... " hey, I know that girl. Yea, I know her man too, so if you get a little bit too close to her.... I will break your jaw on his behalf."  It felt good going to Bar 13 after a three week hiatus.  To go back to a new format that I was honestly convince was going to bore the hell out of me had me worried. Yet, they delved into new ground and I think they have a hit on their hands.   Crazy kudos to the girls of LouderARTS.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      Ever had one of those days that you are tired? Not physically tired but tired of bullshit. Tired of people, tired of shiesty shit, tired of fake ass hypocrite's, tired of people that walk this earth who think they know every iota of information known to man. Tired of arrogance. Tired at the fact that you can't pound them to the fuckin ground for they can ensure their proper place amongst society.  Where did becoming a savage ghetto thug morph into a bad thing?   I much rather beat a yuppie with  a actual lamb then be impressed by a caligraphy on lambskin.    Yep   Bad mood

      ..........As I didnít want to cloud my head with anything last night- I stood shut!  Well, instead of having 300 people come to the NUYO and see me slam, whoever showed up was in for that surprise at seeing Fish finally take part in a Friday slam.  I have been going to NUYOrican for about a year now. Almost to the point that I actualy can tolerate Julio. If you donít know, Julio is the doorman with the most famed cranky attitude this side of the great river. Anyway,  I headed out there and I managed to drop almost no hints at my slam participation.  The night started well with Mike McGhee being the spotlight feature. He is straight up fuckin amazing and I hope we have a surprise at Acentos this coming Tuesday.   Well, the slam came and went last night and I did ok. I didnít win and did .....well........came in last.  I lost out to several people with pretty decent poetry.  I went first in the first round and that 25 .8 killed me. I held court with in the later round but I could play catch up.    I was still happy with everything and the experience. I could say that I performed on the most famous stage in the NYC slam scene.   What scared me was the fact that I was not nervous. I was too cool and too comfortable. I always felt that whenever you are not nervous ñ that is when you need to write more. So when I got home ........ I went to bed  LOL  I wasnít writing at 5am ñ fuck that.  I did write one poem that was very Nuyo style oriented. It think I wrote it out of anger in some ways.  Too much talk about the government, slavery, 41 shots, and Bush. So, I wrote the typical ì If another poet talks about revolution ñ I am going to cut me a motherfucker ì  I feel good. The experience was a solid Surreal Moment.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      You missed enough blog material for two decades.  WHAAAAAAAT!!!!!!!!??????????  anywho......... The Acentos Kabal headed to the last installment of word resurrection at the Cheyenne Roadhouse in the deepest part of Queens that I didn't even know fuckin existed.    Good night for the high level of interesting moments and memories that we all went home with last night.   WHAAAAAAATT!!!!!!?????  Rl da gifted one did his stand-up hosting bit last night. We went through two rounds of open mic and everything from the Acentos Crew did well. Even picked up Ed Garcia and made him an honorary Kabal lackie for the evening.   After getting home last night and realizing how different all these poetry venues are - I really appreciate the love and respect that we are getting at Acentos.  We are working hard and keeping focused on the bigger picture. Yet, we are truly keeping it true to the poetry and ensuring the love is there. Everyone can show you love but not many can be genuine.  I pride myself on that niche that we have.  Well, not much to say but........  HOOWWWwwwwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooollllll!!!!!  Peace, Love, and struggle and struggle and struggle  Fish

      A couple of years back I was mad tight with this dude Wil. Me and him were tighter then your normal friends. No..not in that sexual way fools. We had this chemistry that clearly saw each others thoughts, next move, and moods.  Wil and I spent over 15 years hanging every single day. From the early morning hours  of 7 am to the next morning of 4am. As young bucks running through the ghetto we always got in all types of mishief. I never regretted my friendship with Wil and till this day we are cool.  The strain in our relationship came when he fucked up on his daughter. There is too much to write and I won't get into it. I just know that he didn't take the proper responsibility as a father. Him and I didn't speak for about 5 years. Little by little- he made a comeback into my life. It will never be the same but there are some things that I do know.  - He may not be my confidant - I have not one ounce of trust for him - He is not a good human being - he lies more then a good lawyer - his priorities are not straight  Here are some things that I can count on him for  - To watch my back and give his life for me - Tell me when I am wrong - help me move and dispose of a body correctly  It's a shame that such a tight friendship was shot to shit but I can at least say that we are cool.   Over the last year or two I have seen fights, bullshit, gossip, demises of friendships and it hurts me to a point. I am cold hearted and I could turn off my emotions in three seconds. I also have the ability to sit and assess a situation and respect a friendship. It is so hard for me to find respect for someone after I lose it. They are very few people that I respect these days.  There are even fewer people that have not gotten on my nerves.  Don't get me wrong - I am not putting "fish" on a pedestal with spotlights as the prime example of righteousness. I just have gone through so much with so many people and it tires me.    It is so hard to keep personal feelings outside of business. I tend to do that here at the job and I know it's wrong but it's nature. I will be the first one to say that if I don't like you.... you can expect to wait for whatever you want for a lonnnnnngggg time.   I am in one of those pensive moods today. I realized that over the years I have gained more friends then most people. As I get older I tend to get anti-social. I can't let anybody come into my life with bullshit. Life is hard and I don't want anyone making it more difficult then what it should be.    as many of the poetry folk say.... " here's the thing "...... Even with the current flock of people in my life, if they give me bullshit, do I have to really deal with it?  Peace, Love, Poetry, Pernil, Porkchops  Fish

      I was coming home yesterday on the train and this family gets on  59th street ( Mom, Pop, 2 kids). The littlest kid was clearly not your normal typical everyday 4 year old.  He had all the visible symptoms of a child that is mentally disabled. This usually culminates with a tongue hanging out of the mouth and the somewhat oval shaped eyes.   I never had a soft spot for people or kids that are mentally disabled. When I was young, my babysitters son was mentally disabled and over several years...... I got used to it. I actually kind of liked it because I used to beat him at everything. It did wonders for my ego. I never treated him different and I always called him a friend.   Let me get technical for three seconds. I know most of the blog stalkers have a brain and needn't a definition on what makes a person mentally disabled. You are still getting a little bit of information. Most of the time when people are disabled it is a dealing of cards that just didn't go their way. When Genes do not combine correctly it can cause it. When  the mother is having a difficult birth and oxygen is cut off to the baby for a prolonged period of time, it can cause it. Certain ailments during pregnancy such as infectious rubella can greatly increase the risk. Shit, also if you choose to drink - you might fuck up your baby.  When you are diagnosed as being mentally retarded ( not able to function to your full potential mentally), you are usually under the normal number of 100 on the IQ test. What qualifies you as being retarded is not being able to socialize, take care of yourself, learn at a normal rate, etc....  Thing that is tearing me apart??? It takes a special type of person to love a child that has come out mentally retarded. It takes dedication, loyalty, love, patience, understanding. When I saw the mother and father taking care of that kid and hugging him-nothing else on that train existed. I was totally focused and I could only wish the love they gave that child would infect the train. 200 people infected with that love would go home and infect their loved ones. Then hopefully, maybe, things would be just a little better in NYC.  On a different note.   Things are well  Oscar rocked out on his feature this past Monday. He pulled out an arsenal that tap danced around new subject matter. Slightly pandering but well crafted. His set was strong and he kept things to the point of his poetry.   Pelo bueno book party was ok. It should have been more packed but it was what it was.  We got a new member to the borg known as "Acentos". A strong writer with a loyalty to the word that rivals many on the scene. Through tears of acceptance (masked by laughter) Jessica Torres is now an official member of this new movement that is spreading like wildfire.  Get down or lay down..... con nosotros o contra.... prepara el movimiento  I'm out  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      If any of ya muddafuckers are jumping up and down for joy because the Dominican baseball  player known as Alex Rodrguez is officially a Yankee - I will shout you out if I specificly remember if you were talking shit several months ago.  Big german George pulled a doozie and fucked the  Boston Red Sox by getting Rodriguez. Man, you can tell the Yankees had no interest in him until Boston tried to get him. Brian Cashman ( Hence the name) must have sucked the big German boss culo hairs to convince him to bring the Dominican to the Yankees.  My concern??? we Need Pitching!! What the fuck?!! We got bats up the ass ( not a good metaphor but it works ). We need some cuban wetbacks ( no offense Rich ) to grab tat little ball with some fresh mud and throw strikes.  I didn't follow last year but I will make it a point to follow the Yankees this year.    One thing for sure - Yankees will always outclass that other classless, useless team. YOu remember them?? The one that got WAXED by the yankees in that Subway series a couple of years back.   heehee  Yankees get on my nerves but I will NEVER root for the Mets.

      The majority of my postings are about poetry and the life that immediately surrounds it. Well, today is something different.    My little clique of pre-poetry buddies normally have a tradition  of going out to a choice place to eat for those quantified birthday celebrations. This past week was my favorite non-poetry white boy birthday-Tom collins. We initially ( me mostly) wanted to head over to Willieís steakhouse but his brother Mike chose another spot.   There is no other way to put it. Oh MY GOD!!! We headed over to a place in White Plains New York called the Cheesecake factory.   The Cheese Cake Factory WHITE PLAINS One Maple Avenue, White Plains, NY 10601 (914) 683-5253 www.cheesecakefactory.com  This place has to be the best restaurant that I have been too in the past three years. The food was outrageous and it is CHEAP!  The decor was two steps above casual and one below classy.  When you walk in and you see the solid oak hosting station and the 60 foot high ceilings ñ you know the place is serious. Then, when you see over 40 people waiting to be seated with an average wait time of 2 hours ñ it is serious times two.   Fortunately we had reservations and everything worked out well with ten of us being seated.  The menu is totally insane and albeit Cheesecake is their specialty- holy shit the food was awesome. I split a Chicken quesadilla with Eric and the guacamole was bananas. I wanted steak but for some reason I decided on the two grilled Porkchops with Mashed potatoes and corn on the cob with home made applesauce.  Talk about great fuckin choice. The grilled porkschops were so good that I turned into a savage and picked up the bone and stripped it clean. I ate every ounce of the applesauce and vividly imagined it on someoneís breast. Now, the mash potatoes were soooo good that I kept how good the were to myself for I can get my fill.  Never have I had such an amazin meal with an all-around everyday fell to it.  Now- I was full and I wasnít going to eat cheesecake but primarily just loaf off whoever decided to get one.  Eric got an oreo cheesecake Tom got a Triple chocolate mouse cheescake Oscar got a Dulce de Leche Cheescake Kelvin got a banana cream Cheesecake  My mouth is watering as I say this. I am not truly a cheesecake fan but the reason behing the naming of the establishment says plenty. I tasted all four cheescakes and they were all to fucking die for. Oscarís dulce de leche cheesecake by far held a solid lead and I have nothing further to describe.   Your patriotic duty to your country, political party, wife, porno is to go to this spot and treat yourself. It is worth it and the prices are reasonable  11 people ( an extra order for Ericís wife that did not attend ) and the bill came out to 429 dollars ñ tip included. I have been to restaurants with just 4 people and broke 700 dollars.   I am home and I need to rest off this gorging of food to gather enough will and strength to go to Bonafideís book release party.  Life is good today  I could die a happy man

      Get down or lay down. This is something I have sorta adopted after realizing that our work is really cut out for us. I say ìusî as the latino contingent on the poetry scene.   Yesterday was the little tribute fundraiser for Pedro Pietri. Oh yes, they are still having those. As of yesterday, they have fulfilled their obligations to Pedroís holistics treatment bill. If they got a total of 6 gís and about another 8 from the previous three that I put together ñ I understand they have enough with the mail-in tally.  I walked into the Julia DeBurgos center and was happy to see that it was packed. When I walked in-first person I saw was Carmen Pietri ñDiaz and she was talking to the guy responsible organizing this certain tribute.  I see Carmen ì Que pasa ladyî ìhi Fish!! ì ( hug) ì I want you to meet Robert Waddellî ì Hey Fish, I heard everything you did at the other events, itís been really hard to reach you. I have you performing tonight if you have a short piece. ì Well, I have several pieces that I can do but just let me knowî I walk away but the vibe I got was weird. He was a fast talker and didnít quite seem to be ........well..........îgenuineî is the only word that comes to mind.  The usual suspects were in tow and I felt comfy. The show it self was ok. It opened up with a video from PrDream and it was of Pedro and all his antics. Several people that seemed rather close to him were also in the video.  The reading that I hosted at Poetas con Cafe was one of clips on the Video.  It was nice to see Pedro at his prime and not have to remember him all fucked up.  Well, on to the show as Frank Perez hosted and I have to say that he was much better then the other ìparrigualloî that hosted the Jan 4 event.  The poets that came to pay tribute were Willie Perdomo, Sandra Maria Esteves, Welfare Poets, and that is all I remember. You see ñ the A.D.D kicked in and I got my fill after I realized the old folks are holding on to something and refuse to let it go.  Not the point.  I was thinking I was going to perform and basically say Thank you to all the people that came out. Yerba Buena, Welfare Poets, Eddie Rosa, Ralphi Sabate were bands that kicked it hard. I got my fill of music and I was incredibly hungry and the bad mood kicked in. After hearing some bomba y plena ñ I guided my Lenny to the door and made my exit. I let Frank know that I was leaving and if I was scheduled to perform ñ I was calling it a night.   As I walked outside I saw Tato Laviera and we had a not so decent conversation. He was drunk with about a blood alcohol level that could jump start a buick.  Robert Waddell quickly approached me and asked me to give him a call to talk about some things. Then........  ì You performed with Eddie Rosa right???î  He had no fuckin clue who I was. After smelling his dragon breathe that was melting my eyebrows, I knew he was in no condition to remember me. I left and called it a good evening of decent poetry and music.   I could have been pissed because I didnít perform but to me it wasnít all about that. I was more pissed that we...... and  I say we.......were not truly recognized for the work that we all put into the first three fundraisers. Thing is.........it is a thankless job when you are behind the scenes.  Then your people are left out to dry when they have as much love and maybe even more to a cause.   It is one of those things that make you think.  Get down or lay down.

      Disclaimer: The following stupidity is allowed about once a year. Give me some slack.  There have been some seriously themed porno movies out there.   We hear about Gothic porn, S&M Porn,  Reality porn, etc etc....  I want to see..... Porno POETRY!!!!  I want to see a guy and a girl having sex performing our historical works in Poetry. Shit, maybe even some modern day poetry.   When I was young  I believed that if I held my breath while crossing bridges  I'd survive the day the ground gave way  CUMSHOT!!!!!    but forgive this armchair interrogation,  one sinner to another. my love  OH BABY.... I'm CUMMING!   The times were rough.  We, steady  Moving  South.  YEAH baby!!!!! He took it south   FUCK ME LIKE BROOKLYN!!   So much will go into what I will say  These words can never be invalidated.  These words will always mean something.

      The word alone is hard to spell. It is not one of the words that would freely fall off my fingers nor tongue in an everyday conversation. Ennnnn cooooo mmmmiiiiuuuummmmmm!!  LOL  Anyway - yesterday was our first foray into the Nuyorican with tension and some drama in tow. The tension was primarily self brought upon myself and I see no good reason for having it. This was well after the fact of having a successful evening.  The night started well and everything went better then my pessimistic ass expected.  Instead of beefing about the bullshit....  " ok, this is the problem - noted - think of solution "  That has been my attitude towards many things as of lately.    Mara started the show last night and I can't help but say that she impresses me everytime I see her perform.  My favorite host ( I have a side of me that will always give back ever since my first trek into Bar 13 ) did well. I did not see one ounce of him nervous and he did not aggravate me. That is definitely a good sign.  All the tribute poets were awesome and I can't tell you how proud I am of Ray and every other person involved in making this show great.   I had to call Ray personally and commend him on a job well done. In staying away from the rehearsals and talks of poems to read - the show was taken several notches above my usual expectations.  If most of you noticed last night... I kept an eye of a hawk on Julio on the door. I don't know him and his reputation of skimming might come into play. Yet, I was not playing.  I kept track of any and all paying customers. I counted a total tally of 56 patrons with 41 paying.  Julio counted 40 paying customers. So we were on the same page and I left happy.   This event was my first event organized with musicians and others with there fingers stirring the pot. It was hard but well worth it with a good show.  I was sad that some people didn't show up but we still had a great time.   Seems that the Nuyorican loved the format of the show and they look forward to a good relationship in the future.  Life is good. Thanks guys  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      Everyone has a certain style of writing and getting their tidbits on mindful rants out to their enduring public.   You hear Unconscious mutterings, pumpkin seeds, surreal moment # so and so.  Welcome to my little world.  Fish Flakes #1     I used to write these daily e-mails called "fishisms" and they snowballed into a huge following. My Blog turned into Fishism 2.0 .......I guess.  Anyway,  Stood away from the Poetry folk yesterday as things seem to really get more on my nerves then the norm.  So, in the interest of keeping my sanity. I headed to the dog show. Ahhhhh.....little doggies being pampered more then a Puerto Rican family in the ghetto has always amused me. The handlers of some of these dogs scream " arrogance". They walk and handle these dogs like royalty and rather have you grovel at their feet.  " Oh mighty Bichon Frise, I am not worthy of your puffy little white hairdoo - please pee on my leg"  I love to look at the handlers and put them in their place with one look.  You know the look I am talking about??  The look that says....... "if I wanted to, I could catch you outside in the dark and you would see the life leaving your body"  I love dogs and have steadily thought about getting a Pug. Thing is - that little dog would go with me everywhere. It would be a staple at Bar 13, Acentos and anywhere else literary.  I can't get a little dog and leave it home. That would be mean of me.   I was really out of it since last week and I am feeling better.  Yesterday was la bomba that made me reach the "fuck it" plateau. I had to deal with some Louder stuff and CWP stuff. In keeping my glass half full. They made sense in what they said. Even though I don't agree with it- it made some sense.  Tonight might be my first Acentos that I have missed. I have to actually go to a Wake ( viewing ) of a friend that passed away last week. Young chic crossing the street and didn't quite see the SUV barreling down. 5000 pounds of metal against a human body of 130 pounds - not much competition.     After hearing the news of her death and dealing with my own issues, I floundered at the edge of that depression shit. I just usually think and stay away from everybody. I was even thinking about how life is short and you can't  waste it. I have been so caught up in this poetry shit and I was thinking about some things. So much poetry, programs, events, readings, books to read. I felt that my life was passing me by. I was so caught up in everything , it was hard for me to live " MY " life.  Of course, shit just clicked during the weirdest conversation and I grew to believe something.  " I am living my life. I am doing something I love to do"  I could die tomorrow and I knew that I could die and say that I was following my dream.  I am doing ok today. I feel a little better and I have to deal with people and be more receptive to shit. Maybe even respect their views on things. Yet, I am not working for the glory of others.  That is my case and it is closed.

      Long post through a migraine....  I have steadily made it public that I am glad I came into my own with a bunch of motherfuckers that put craft of poetry before performance. If you have shit work and perform the hell out of it- it makes no point to even write.  I can't front and say that I am a so-so performer. I can rock that stage and I have the utmost confidence in saying I do. This means that I have to work on the quality of the words that I drop on my page.   Last night was my experience with Def Poetry and being there slightly skewed my previous opinion; as pompous as it was I might add.  One of my biggest problems were the lack of new voices intertwined with major repeat performances. I was not happy to hear people taping for the 3rd time in the 4 year  history of DPJ.  I even slightly offended one of my good friends with some comments that I made without thinking. I was angry and miffed and instead of supporting her unconditionally; stupidity took over.  I have apologized to her directly and I do it here. " I am sorry V ".   When I got to DPJ, it was 1:15 pm. It was strange to see not one person standing in line for a show. Turns out the show was on Wednesday night and I was there feeling really lousy. I sat down to stew some anger but also think of what strings I can pull.  Pull, yank and tug and I got a poets pass and that made my evening really sweet.  No lines, no muss nor fuss. Even when Rich got there and he was about 3 miles from the door, I walked him in through the back door. Yes folks, my bouncer experience came in handy and the back door searching proved handy for Rich. Shit, I even walked Matt through the back.  I think the shows are nothing new.  I was not terribly moved by some of the poetry. The poets I gravitated to were clearly the older one's. Don't get me wrong, most of the poets were good but could you compare Faraji Salim to Martin Espada??  Could you compare Flowmentalz to Yousef Komunyakaa??  Could you even put Speech in the same room as Reg E. Gaines??    It was a good night for most of the poets.  The Poetic Rockstars were out there and it was a good time.  I gratuitously borrowed (stole) a set list of every poet that has performed through all ten shows. I will get it to this list to take bets to see who will or will not make the cut.  All in all, my perspective has changed somewhat and I am kinda torn as to what benefits DPJ will give the poetry community.  As for the poets themselves they reap the benefits with press, popularity, exposure and many future paying gigs.    I wish I was the booker for DEF POETRY for a few shows.  I know the show wouldn't do that well because I will cater to true poetry buffs. The ultimate Def Poetry Show for me.........  Ultimate  Show: Jimmy Santiago Baca Piri Thomas Tony Brown Victor Hernandez Cruz Cheryl Boyce Taylor Sonia Sanchez Martin Espada    Good experience  Peace

      In one of those moods today. Went to sleep at 8:30pm but woke up at 1 am and stood awake. I have alot on my mind. I don't know If I am actually hating this year on Def Poetry Jam. Wow.  The previous years I never paid it any mind but this year it is bothering me that I have heard of major repeat performances. I will always support every poet within or around my circle and I have nothing against them. Yet, the booker at DPJ needs some knowledge as to who is on the scene. From the top of my head I can think of most performances being repeats. I guess Stan Lathan pimping our community is something that I am taking kinda personal. It press right??? Well - not all press is good press.    More on my feelings later. Right now, I have been really miffed over several things.  Peace

      I have always prided myself in making anyone that frequents casa pescatore as comforable as possible. I want them to make sure they feel at home as they will feel in their prospective residence. Yesterday- I hope I succeeded.  The masses all congregated on Perry Ave with what many consider " Extreme Prejudice". 4:30pm was the time my best friend Eric and his son NuNu came over with a huge pan of Baked ziti. The tables were set and I had all the food that I cooked and the bells were ringing crazy. Before I could blink - My best Friend from Florida walked through the door and that made me smile. I missed that motherfucker so much. The bonus was him bringing his wife along. She is expecting and this is the closest I could get to being an uncle. I spoiled that girl with tray after tray of food and tiramisu.   From Oscar to Rich - Tom and Mike - Roger, Lynne, Danny, Amalia, Herman, John,  Jessica, Abena, Diane, Ed , Seve, And a whole bunch of other people that I forgot. I was pretty happy with the turnout and the food that came through my table.   Buffalo Chicken wings, sausage bread, Cornbread Chicken wings, Baked ziti, Turkey, Shrimp, Chili, Vietnamese spring rolls, Pork dumplings, chicken rolls, Popeyes chicken, Three kinds of rice, Corona, heineken, soda and just everything else under the sun.  So in keeping on top of everything. I got to see just the last 44 seconds of the game. I had very little interest because I have a deep hatred for both teams so my night consisted of playing host, waiter, gopher.   I think the best thing about last night was the diversity of friends. I had the "poet" folk enjoying everything. I had the "ghetto" folk actin a fool. I had the "loud family" thing going on.  It was great to have them all under one roof and it was probably the most successful SuperBowl party to date.   Well, Off to bigger and better things.  Peace

      So many of us got it good and people continue to talk shit. You have a job, family, health, and 98% of you have the ability to write awesome poetry.     A good friend of mines went through some shit yesterday and it ticked me off. I mean I was genuinely angry.  I never thought that I would be so upset over something that I thought would have been petty back in the day but times a changing.  I have a busy day today but here is a quick thing while I move to the future.  I joke around with people's races but I never pass judgement on your race, culture, ethnicity, background. I respect everything about everyone because I appreciate the respect in return.   If anyone has a remote possibility of saying something biased, racist, anti-semitic.... please make sure it's not around me.  I am not white but I will defend my white friends with everything in my arsenal. I am not black but I will fight anyone that will try to put down my black folk. I am not Jewish but I will hurt anyone that belittles them. I am latino and I will definitely do everything possible to hurt you if you attempt to hurt me.  Fish

      Nah. Just joking. I am not really in a mood to write about some dude cumming on a girls face and she acts like it's the sexiest thing that has ever happened on God's green earth. I actually think it's kinda stupid. Nuff said.   Decent day yesterday. Another installment of "Raise the Red Tent". I actually have the book and I am going to try and get the whole thing read this week before I give it back to Maria next Monday. I hope it's a good read.   The energy was a little bit better yesterday compared to the last couple of shows. 30 paying patrons with about 49 total in attendance.  I am keeping track of how many people come through. We need more people at 13 so the marketing blitz continues.   I wanted to leave early yesterday but stood until the end after seeing " Wild Fever " get on stage and do their thing. It was a fitting tribute to this "tent' series. Elana has some serious writing skills.  Yesterday she showed a broad range in her set and I was really impressed.  I never like her poetry when I first came on the scene since I thought screaming and ranting was the call to order. Once I started pursuing the craft and literary excellence that we strive for, Elana is as close as anyone else.   Obena rocked the Q & A portion and she asked every question that was milling about the brain.  They had one line ( with the ever present repetition ) that stuck to me. " When will we un-learn our brilliance?". I love that line! Most of the time I always feel, the more we increase our knowledge, the more we increase our sorrow.  How can we find our happiness by un-learning all our knowledge that has harnessed so much unhappiness?? It's just hard to know about everything that is wrong in this world and still try to keep a happy face.  Anyway......  Everything is good.   Tomorrow will be another erotic entry. Any subjects you would want me to touch on??   Possible subjects:  Threesomes Midget sex Pregnant women sex Interracial animal sex Geriatric sex  FACIALS!!!!! Swallowing Perfect Blow jobs Bad Blow Jobs Anal sex Golden showers Big penis or small penis ? Hair or no hair? Fat dude or skinny dude?   Pick it and the Love Fish will write about it  OK   I am bored  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      When I was first given the opportunity to e-mail the outside world from my job I acted a total fool. Not too far off from what I do now but I was a little bit over the edge.  I tended to give more attention to shock value over the quality of my writings. Most of the topics of my e-mails ( Fishisms ) were my endless pursuit of the perfect Blowjob. Since more then a few people offend very easily read this blog I can't write about that. So, I will write about Buttlicking and so on.  Yes folks, the one thing that will keep a woman happy and will never let her stray. Oh yea, like if ya motherfuckers out there don't do that.  A man denying that he licks his woman's butt is either lying or he just refuses to give his woman the bliss that she is entitled to.  I don't remember my first time I engaged in this illicit activity. Shit, I barely remember the last and even first time I ever went down on a girl. I just know that I am damned good at it. You see, I perpetuate that myth that fat dudes have to compensate. I am not going to rock you for 1 hour. You are lucky if you get a good 5 solid strokes out of me.  Yet........ If I get my tongue between your legs - I will not come up for at least an hour. Then, my tongue will gratuitously grace your butthole with some slow methodic long vertical licks. So if you are on your back... Start all the way on the bottom and just lick slowly all the way up and flick the clit. You see, that is the trick. You have to put pressure on the clit and flick it. Both her legs should flinch wildly - if so, you is the man ( or woman ).  I have met some dudes that refuse to go down on women. Of course they are the single fuckers with no intentions on satisfying anyone but themselves. We call them the "three stroke Ponies". I never understood how some men can actually get with women and start the whole erotic thing and not satisfy the women.  Oh, and then the dudes play crazy..... " damn , I wonder why she hasn't called me back"?. Well, maybe because you didn't go down on her, you didn't shower, You shoved your tongue so far down her throat you gave her heartburn, You had trouble putting on the Old dry condom, she wasn't wet, You stroked three times and it was over. THEN, You got the nerve to ask " Was that good for you ma?". OF course the mothering instincts kick in and she says " Yes papi, it was good ".  You call your boys and exclaim " Dawg, I just rocked this chic hard core ". You head home and revel in your last conquest. Meanwhile, she gets home and she has the black marker and erases you from her black book, erases you from the PDA, Erases you from the cell phone, Changes her house number and changes her cell. The voice mail at her job will always be on. She re-connects her Caller I.D and answering machine. Don't get it twisted, ALLLLLL of her homegirls will know that you are garbage in bed.  All of this because you didn't lick the butt-hole.   So, if you want some tips... read on young brothers and sisters.  Tips for the perfect sexual tryst   1-	Don't be in a rush. Even is he/she is naked, that doesn't mean you are getting laid. 2-	It's all about teasing and being slow. Kiss the neck and lick everything within your reach. Literally lay the person on the back and lick everything possible. Don't concentrate on the genital area, lick there but don't stay there. This is where you tease 3-	Use the hands softly and as much as possible. Play with her hair when you are licking the chest. Kinda massage the back of her head and give her hair a soft tug. If she likes her hair being tugged, she will moan, if she doesn't she will stay shut. 4-	When the guy is going down on you, play with his hair/head. Guys love that. Shit, I LOVE THAT! Why you think I have all my hair now. Play with it carajo. 5	Don't be shy to whisper dirty little things in the ears. After teasing for about an hour or two ( licking, sucking, fingering, nibbling ) - whisper things like this but use confidence  " I want you sooo bad " " Mmmmmmmm...... you smell good " ( breathe deep in the ear ) " How bad do you want it ?" " You are sooooo wet "  If you don't get a phone call the next day, hang up your shoes and turn your card in buddy. You are now worthless  Peace, Love, Porkchops  DR FISH PHD The love fish

      Took a nice day off from the world today. I need one of those every once in a while.  I specifically left my day free of all appointments because I didnít want to be obligated to go anywhere.  If I would have stood home, I would have spoken to people and my day wouldnít have been mines. So, the hooptie was filled with supreme gasoline and the I-87 and I became one. It felt good to just bounce and enjoy the drive.   Well, last night was a great evening with something historical in the making. ì Louder then words ì made itís debut at the Bowery Poetry club. I canít tell you anything negative at the moment. Guy has hatched a plot for something huge and I am glad he got his finger on it. I can see the masses trying to steal this idea but we know it was born in the mind of a incindiery maniac.  The show was insane. I loved the format because it was something new. Guy and his borg melded Poetry and Poet politics to give an attentive audience a first hand look into a poets brain. No more trying to get the poets attention after a slam to get a better idea where that poem came from. Now, they answer questions from the audience and the ìfireStarterî Guy himself.  Guy started the show with the necessary diatribe as to where the idea came from, his views, his opinions,  and all that is him.  After seeing Jessica, Mara and Luis read some awesome Poetry- up came a Diva Named Roger and a republican that goes the name of Taylor.  Roger did a few new pieces and kicked an oldie. That blue sex prodigy is a piece that he loves but for some reason I am not digging that piece.   Taylor came and covered several pieces and handled his time well.  With the featured poets taking there places on stage to be interviewed by Guy ( bad cop ), Eric G ( Good cop ), and Helen ( the smart cop )......the fiesta started.   I donít care what anyone say but Taylor handled himself wonderfully. Rog was a boxer with his guard up the whole fight without throwing one punch. I honestly think that Guy intimidated the shit out of Rog and he was so ready that he looked for the shots instead of mounting an offense. The question of context in a poem came up and Taylor used the example about writing about rape. To make a long story short, this one dude came p and it was taken in a totally different direction.   The show was great and I am looking forward to the next one. Some small tweaks and changes to make it more audience friendly and this is going to be the next big thing.  Fuggit  Time to go  Peace, Love, que se joda

      .....for three hours only. relax, I am not doing time - ever!   I donít know everything but I know what makes me happy. Yesterday was my first trek back to Rikers island for my third term teaching a poetry workshop. Last term was an interesting collaboration between several CWP interns and myself. I have no clue whatís going on this term ( with CWP ) but going in on a Friday and getting their immediate trust is a beautiful thing.  In going to Rikers about a year and a half ago, I had no clue what I was going to teach and how I was going to do it. I always say truthfully that I am new to this field and I have alot to learn to be on the same level as anyone that has been reading poetry since who knows when.  The first term was fly by night, the second was slightly focused. I can give this term a much more solid view of poetry. Compared to the first day Rog left me there by myself, I have researched enough to be a better teacher.    On Thursday, my feet took me to the centennial birthday celebration for Pablo Neruda. The only one worth mentioning was Martin Espada and Illan Stavans. They discussed the impact Neruda had on them and read several translations of Neruda. An open panel discussion followed with a wine and cheese Reception.  It felt really really good to Have Martin Come out with his hand to shake mines and then he hugs me. Even though Martin is not my all time favorite poet/author- he is up there and it feels good to say ì I know himî  Well, with Neruda fresh on my mind, what better way to start another term at Rikers?  I did some research because I havenít stolen a Pablo Neruda book yet and picked the perfect poems to start the class. It was Nerudaís three poems. Oh man, The first one is called ìpoetryî,this was perfect for the class.  Read on my young Schmucks......  THREE POEMS  PABLO NERUDA  POETRY And it was at that age...Poetry arrived in search of me. I don't know, I don't know where it came from, from winter or a river. I don't know how or when, no, they were not voices, they were not words, nor silence, but from a street I was summoned, from the branches of night, abruptly from the others, among violent fires or returning alone, there I was without a face and it touched me.  I did not know what to say, my mouth had no way with names my eyes were blind, and something started in my soul, fever or forgotten wings, and I made my own way, deciphering that fire and I wrote the first faint line, faint, without substance, pure nonsense, pure wisdom of someone who knows nothing, and suddenly I saw the heavens unfastened and open, planets, palpitating planations, shadow perforated, riddled with arrows, fire and flowers, the winding night, the universe.  And I, infinitesmal being, drunk with the great starry void, likeness, image of mystery, I felt myself a pure part of the abyss, I wheeled with the stars, my heart broke free on the open sky.    You can't get a better poem to start a class then this. The guys were really digging the poem and I explained to them how poetry changed my life. I showed them Neruda and then read one of my poems. They were given a hugely wide spectrum on what to expect. Everything in between myself all the way back to who knows when.  I lead them in a small writing exercise to write something in under 5 mins to tell me something about themselves and have it memorized. I stole the idea from Taylor's workshop. I wasn't really going to have them memorize it but I wante to jostle their brains. Mad students yesterday and they were all writing. When the 5 minutes were up, I didn't have to pick volunteers, they were all ready willing and able to read.   Next Friday I am going to bring in Some Willie Perdomo.  The class is a good mix and they will get a feel of Smoking Lovely  Well, On that note. I am off. Tonight is the jump-off for "Louder then Words". I am actually reading for them next Saturday. I am happy for Guy, that motherfucker can't stay away from this even if he wanted to. He picked the perfect people to help him with this project. I am a firm believer that you have to surround yourself with good people in order to have shit work correctly.    Peace , Love , Poetry. Porkchops   P.S These are the other Pablo Poems  SADDEST POEM I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.  Write, for instance: "The night is full of stars, and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance."  The night wind whirls in the sky and sings.  I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.  On nights like this, I held her in my arms. I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.  She loved me, sometimes I loved her. How could I not have loved her large, still eyes?  I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her.  To hear the immense night, more immense without her. And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass.  What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her. The night is full of stars and she is not with me.  That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away. My soul is lost without her.  As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her. My heart searches for her and she is not with me.  The same night that whitens the same trees. We, we who were, we are the same no longer.  I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her. My voice searched the wind to touch her ear.  Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once belonged to my kisses. Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes.  I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her. Love is so short and oblivion so long.  Because on nights like this I held her in my arms, my soul is lost without her.  Although this may be the last pain she causes me, and this may be the last poem I write for her.   CLENCHED SOUL We have lost even this twilight. No one saw us this evening hand in hand while the blue night dropped on the world.  I have seen from my window the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops.  Sometimes a piece of sun  burned like a coin in my hand.  I remembered you with my soul clenched in that sadness of mine that you know.  Where were you then? Who else was there? Saying what? Why will the whole of love come on me suddenly when I am sad and feel you are far away?  The book fell that always closed at twilight and my blue sweater rolled like a hurt dog at my feet.  Always, always you recede through the evenings toward the twilight erasing statues.

      It's funny,   I was going to write some shit about that young  kat that was caught trying to cross a check point in the middle east with a bomb strapped to his chest. The kid was between 14- 16. He was reported to be somewhat " slow " and he was given 22 dollars and promised 72 virgins when he died.   This made me think, I am going to give some one 30 dollars and promise them 80 virgins and give them a gun - I wonder what would happen?  Anyhow,  In segue to Oscar's blog and what he mentioned about some of the Bronx tragedies that have befallen my fellow Bronxites - I wondered about some things.  When you hear things in the Media with Anthony Baez, Happyland, Valentines day Prospect Massacre ( the only massacre in the Bronx ) how about the things you never hear???  For every murder, suicide, tragedy, accident you hear on the news, there are about 12 that go unheard of.   What exactly is worthy to put on the air has always irritated me. Years ago, my uncle was killed and it made the Spanish newspaper here in NY called " el Diario ". The title was loosely translated for you English colonized schmucks......  " Shoot out between bandits leaves one dead and three injured "  All of the Spanish speaking community that reads that paper read that Miguel Vargas was a bandit in the street that died while he engaged in a shootout. Not only was my family hurt with the death of a family member, imagine that story on top of it.   After several well placed phone calls of threats with lawsuits that will shut shit down, a retraction was written. We didn't want a small ten word retraction- we want a fucking page and a story saying how much he contributed to his neighborhood.  He was a hardworking furniture that was caught in the cross fire.  I hate the media. Pathetic is that I work form one of the biggest media companies in the world.   So many people that never made the news. So much tragedy that never had the light of day.  "Tony Cortes Shoots himself in his chest and dies "  No media  "Mark Barrios Shoots himself in the head and dies " No Media  Jermaine Hangs himself in his bedroom " No media  Freddy Martin is killed protecting two girls " No media  Charlie is run over by a city bus and killed " No Media  Cano is chased from a roof by two pitbulls and falls three stories and dies " No media  Suly is shot accidentally by her boyfriend and she dies " No media  Jorge is killed in a shoot out with bouncers " No Media  Nelson is killed in a fight while chasing a mugger into a building " No Media  Angel dies of an Asthma Attack after moving to Virgina for a better life " No Media  Harry plays russian roulette and loses when a bullet enters his head " no media  Jose is shot and killed in a chinese food place after an argument " no Media  Joe is shot and killed in an after hours club " No media"  Steve is shot and killed on Elder Ave " No Media  Keith is killed on a harlem street protecting his pregnant girl from someone trying to rob them" No media  Carolyn, Irene, Kathy all died of cancer and they all attended the same high school " No media"  Cheena crosses the street and gets hit and killed by a SUV " No media    So much personal tragedy ( personal as in I knew all these people personally ) and I never heard a peep in the news, papers, radio.    Back in 1995 there was a fuckin war in the streets and the news didn't have a fucking clue. 8 days straight with 9 shoot-outs and there was not a peep.   What did make news on my block???  Tango & Cash was a new dope and sample's were given out to the dopefiends to get a free taste. 29 dopefiends drop within ten mins of snortin the dope.  27 are taken to the hospital and 9 die.  That was some major shit. Every channel in the tri-state area came to my block interviewing everybody from the local supper's to the grocery store clerks.  Amadou Diallo was one block away from my old neighborhood. I don't even need to get into that.  I don't even know if all this makes sense. Shit was just fucked up and the media never gave two shits.

I am angry today  I am scared   I want Eric home  Last fight I had was about 1 month ago in front of the pizzaa shop. I didn't tell anybody.

      Late post today.  I have been thinking about the things that I am a part of too much lately.  I love doing tings that are productive and not staying home just watching porn 16 hours a day; even thought there is nothing wrong with that.  Yesterday was one of those days that put my emotions through a grinder.  I wanted to post nothing but how great acentos was bright and early this morning but perspectiveis a motherfucker.    Bright and early yesterday was my first call/e-mail that made me say..... ì we might have some issues today ì . Three seconds after that is when I found out that Eric was in the hospital with a hernia that made it difficult to walk.  So I didnít know where I stood or if I was coming or going yesterday.   You all know the Acentos Fiesta was going to be of the hook. Even though we have set a high bar for other anniversary shindigs; Eric was still on my mind.  I donít have many people that I call brother. I donít have many people that I will turn to when I want to rip someoneís head off.  Eric is probably te only person in this world that I will go to and cry. I will drop everything at the drop of a that to do whatever he needs me to do. Now, even though this hernia shit is small compared to other surgical procedures-it is still something that worried me.   He came out of it ok and a ton of bricks were lifted off my shoulders. In visiting him this morning and spending time with him being drugged up. That made me appreciate more the love that I have for him.   I never had a person I can call ìBrotherî as close as to how I feel to him.   It scares me to think about one day not being able to call him or talk to him. I am not talking about death, I am talking about a falling out, beef, argument, misunderstanding.    I kept tabs on him most of the night with some discreet phonecalls so that was cool.    Now, to the thing we call Acentos...........  Shit, what a night........  I started the night early because the place was packed. Oscar suggested this and regardless how much we but heads ñ I actually thought it was a good idea. 7:30pm saw a Blue ox at standing room only and it was time to start.   ì Welcome to the Blue ox and our first full year here at Acentooooooosssssssssss ì  A nice applause and we were off to  what many call the races. I said a couple of choice things but it wasnít about me. I wanted to get all the open mic folks to come through and get there little piece of history. 9 people on the OPEN mic and it was off to introduce Rich Villar.  Damn, it was hard not to get emotional. Acentos has been our baby for 1 year and Rich has become an integral part in every aspect of what we do.  A generic intro and the tears were held back.  Rich is that little brother that I never had. He is that smart little fucker that knows more then me and he doesnít know I look up to him.  He is the one that makes sense when anger takes over my every move. He gives me reason to get better. He gives me reason to learn. He gives me reason for everything we do right at Acentos.  He takes his portion of the mic and destroys it. He makes that part his own and does it with gusto. His humor, his style, his energy.  The readers were great and 70 patrons listening attentively- surreal moment # I have no clue. The break is upon us and I have no where to move.  I have the bucket  and one more reader to go. A nervous as fuck Eliel Lucero comes through and reads a new piece. After some informal workshopping for the Acentos kabal. He delivers a new piece with a new found anger and intensity. I never liked him too much because he was doing shit that turned me off. After some poking and prodding from the kabal that thought he could do better, he impressed me last night. he actually touched me. Then, the break...........  This is where Jessica comes up and says the funniest shit in Acentos history when she put in place the L.A.P. She reads a poem she wrote in Honor of the Rev Pedro Pietri and I am sitting there looking at her. She has gotten so far in my heart as a person and poet. She strives everyday and tries much harder then I did we  co-founded Acentos.  She has a glow, not a warm inviting glow, a fucking bright neon glow that brightens the block, Acentos and everything within her immediate radius. She introduced Miguel Algarin and this was another surreal moment. A packed Blue Ox  and Miguel Algarin ( the co-founder of the Nuyorican poets cafe ) is reading at Acentos! Oh man, why am I not crying over and over again?  After some well placed drool and he reads his poetry, he is off into the NYC night. Another quick 5 minute break and the rest of the night is upon us. The home stretch, the last mile, the last piece to a perfect puzzle.  Oscar brings his sortarican style to the mic. The energy is high, the love is present, the Ox is still full. Itís no secret that Oscar and I fight like cat and dogs. Yet, when all is said and done, we have the perfect mix to make what we do great.  Oscar has come a long way and last night his hosting was on point. Then it hit me, we have done this for over a year and him and I started a movement.  Whatever we have done, taken, borrowed, used, stolen from other venues and  readings, we have learned to perfect an equation for a successful reading series.    More poets that have made Acentos. Then the last suprise to make this reading the hotness in the B.X. Mayda deValle is brought to the mic for what is known as an Acentos mini-feature. She drops some new work because Rich is our resident Acentos Shout out person; ìIs that new work?î. It was sorta new so she dropped it and it was intense. I forgot how intense Mayda is and it was more then a pleasure to have her.   She finishes and only as we can do......... we brought champagne for the whole bar and engaged in a toast.  ì to one year at Acentos........ Saludî  We all drink, we toast....   we say our good byeís.  So much energy goes into running this thing. The appreciation factor is almost invisble. Yesterday made up for so many days that we went home without a simple ì thank you ì.  We have built an incredible community. We have built a family. From simple hugs to thanks for coming out....... it is beautiful to have this community standing behind everything we do.  Time to say my Thanks back  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Memorable quotes from Bar 13  She Says..."Fish, do you think my ass is fat?? Or is it too big?" Fish Says.... " I'd fuck ya, be happy"  Yes folks, this was the type of night at 13 last night. Rather surreal evening because of all the nuttiness going on.   I haven't really been going to 13 for the simple reason that I have to much shit going on. I went last night and it was ok. The open mic was interesting with some stand out poets:good or as bad as they were. This one lady got up there and read an epic poem of "War and Peace" I think.  I couldn't help it but hate on her. She was there for about 13 mins. I am not exaggerating.  All of the NUYO slam borg showed up last night to compete in the slam. As they say..." They all come out of the woodworks when it's time to get rank". I won't even lie to you, it was interesting to see them basically take over the slam. Last night it was Carlos, Jive, Mahogany, Ainsley, Jai, Shawn Randall, and fish.  I drew up first and it was pretty fucking pissy that it happened again! That little paper always says " 1 ". I was a little bit purturbed and I was about to go with the big guns in the first round but I stuck to my personal morals and slammed a new piece off page.  I got a 27.4 and I was kinda happy.  Ainsley and I tied in the first round so we both moved to the second round. I went last and figured that I better do it hard. In order for me to move to the next round, I had to be Jive poetic accumulative score of 57.3. Uh, do the math, I needed a perfect 30 in order to tie Jive.  I pulled out the big guns and fell short about a point. So, I won't be in the next round and my semi-finals invite might have been shot to shit.  Oh well, There is so much more then slam and I am just having fun. I am laying down the foundation for my well deserved respect.  Carlos took the slam and the Latino take over is here son.   Anyway, many e-mails to write today.  I will write later  Peace  Love

      Yesterday was a pretty cool day. Headed out to the old neighborhood with Peter Dressel to grab some pics. I was giving it thought as to what would be best in giving everyone an idea what I am and how I got here.    It was funny when I got to my old block and started taking some pics if front of the typical ghetto memorial mural. Went across the street to where my three fingers decided to take a permanent vacation and left my body. It was weird standing there. I haven't stood on that same spot in about 14 years.  Something kinda clicked inside of me and it was clear to see it was anger. 14 years later and I still get pissed when I go back to that day.  Some people know a story, some people know THE story, some people know the truth. Either way, standing there with a camera in my face clicking away and my heart racing, it was probably the hardest thing I have done this year.   Decided to head to the cemetery and take some shots out there. The only place where I can go and forget about poetry, life, work, girl issues, cars, full of shit niggers, rats and bitches.  I go to the cemetery a little too much in my older years. I tend to usually go visit my uncle. I thought about it yesterday about how much I think about my eternal sleep. Seeing a tombstone with my very own last name always makes me feel calm.  The thought that one day I don't have to LIVE life anymore is something that I look forward to. I don't really care about heaven, hell, purgatory... it 's the long relaxed sleep that I look forward to.  I know, it's morbid but sleep comes far and few these days.  When we posed, the sky opened up and it was clear as day. It was cold as fuck but it was beautiful. Peter was digging  shooting at a cemetery. I gave him a first and that always makes me feel good.  Decided to go pick up this kat that meant alot to me back in the day to include him in the " what made me Project"   I haven't hung with Wil in a while and I am still amazed at how he will drop anything in 2 seconds to do whatever I say. We decided to head back to Elder ave to the building where I haven't stepped foot since the day I moved out. Walked into the lobby and took some cool shots in front of a window full of bullet holes. That has to say the most for me right there.   Elder ave..... wow  I miss that block but I don't want to be back there. Same shit and nothing new there.    Fish

      Ok, this event at Urbana was three step beyond off the hook.  I will write about Billy Collins a little bit later.  Yesterday I have come to this concept....  " Poets are all fucking crazy "  Ed Has issues Shappy is weirder then what I first thought  Taylor is crazy Eric has volumes  The limerick slam was one those moments in your life that you are glad you are not a part of. They had to be about 20 people up there going head to head with there own original limericks. Taylor created  this system and it proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has too much time on his hands.  Some of the people up there were horrible with their limericks and we made it known. The louder borg was actin a fool yesterday and it felt good. I kinda been feeling we have been toooooo serious lately and we needed an out. We got an out yesterday screaming ....  " that was a piece of shit" Oh my god. you suck " " You are still there , get off "  " That is not a fuckin limerick" " you can't start a new language"  After yesterday, Lynne's boobs were nicknamed Canteloupe's and Melons, Ed shits in his pants, REID harris Cooper sticks books in his ass, Oscar give me rim jobs, Roger has a huge cock, and everything else under the son.   Interesting night........  Peace

      Painting is done.  It's about fuckin time. These dudes took a full week to paint my living room.  I have seen 16, 000 square feet painted in 9 hours. It took them 7 full days to paint 60 sq feet. Well, that off the books labor can't be all that great now can't it?  I am back at work after getting some things done in my house. I got a late night phone call last night from a friend that her mother was admitted to the hospital for some mental issues. It's kinda sad because I saw that coming. The lady is clearly depressed and she needs help. When I used to go over and visit and these horrible vibes shot through me, I had no choice but to stop visiting. I wasn't ready to deal with things like when I wasn't obligated to.   So in the interest of being a friend, I provided a safe haven last night with some hugs and assurances. We caught some TV( Sopranos ) and a movie. I felt good when they left because they left in a much better state of mind hence when they came.  So, I am getting more points into heaven.   Right now I am just like the game show Jeopardy. I am so far into negative territory that I need much more then a few points to get INTO heaven. I think the only pass I could get unabated into heaven would be saving the Pope's life or some shit.   Found out some interesting gossip from around the  way. Makes me kind of glad I am soooo out of the loop that it really seems shocking.  Some dude around my way is probably the most feared thug in the Bronx. He walks into any club untouched but very noticed. Several attempts on his life have gone unsuccessful. The ones that have attempted paid the ultimate price. Besides that..... he is a really nice guy.   Turns out a gentleman doing 20 to life just found out his wife was doing the horizontal, vertical, upside down, in all ways everyday mambo with the dude. The gentleman came home and confronted the dude and several threats later........ he walks away.   I have several questions.......  IF the gentleman was doing 20 to life..... how did he come out to walk the street???  Why is a detective calling my house leaving a number to call them back concerning an issue? ( I haven't called back )  In the game ( Hussle ) several things will bring you down.  - Greed - Women - just not being loyal   The lake is being disturbed on Watson. I am off parole and they can't do shit to me right about now. Plus, I don't know anything.   Stay tuned......  PEace  P.s  I get great writing material everyday from this fuckin block

      Yesterday was my NYC sloshing into Taylor mali's workshop. I first met Taylor during my " I hate anything White stage ". I am not afraid to admit my ignorance but I have learned that being so closed minded has genuinely hurt me in being a better person. Over the a two year period in gradually having decent conversation with Taylor- I realized why he is so good at what he does. Taylor is straight up cut throat.  I admire that.  In his workshop yesterday he said something that many of the louder folk would have died and fought tooth and nail against. Now, I understand the inner workings of a poet who is somewhat insane.   To be honest, I am not spilling the beans about what was said in the workshop because hey......... spend the money and support a person who is doing his part to better this community.   Next Class, I am helping Taylor plug. There has to be more then 10 people there the next time. With my "influence", I can get about 20 people there.  We see  One thing I learned is what school of poetry do you come from??? Taylor has a school that he calls " The Immaculate School of Inspirational Eloquence ". I have garnered the balls to call my school of where I have learned poetry " The school of hard knocks of no rhyme nor reason ". It suits me being an ex-knucklehead coming into a world that has accepted me. I don't know if it was fear or just that I am a nice guy. I was still accepted and it was cool......  I wrote this poem that had to say who I was in less then 30 secs and I had to have it memorized also:  Everyone in life will die once I already died twice 1992, I lost three fingers along with my life 1998, I lost freedom and died in jail  I came home I found a pen I found a writer  the writer became a dreamer the dreamer will die a poet  Cute little piece  Peace  Fish

      The shoes were buffed, the khaki's were pressed, the shirt was ironed - off to the Community Word Benefit I went. It was held at the National Arts Club. A place where my first hour or two consisted of me looking for Latino names. Some guy named Xavier Gonzalez was honored back in 1978. Who is he ??? I have no clue.   Plenty of portraits and paintings hanging all over the place. Nice red velvet couches and a whole bunch of uptight white folk. Not attending the benefit but milling about.  The benefit itself was a good experience.  I gravitated towards several people here and there. I met Edie Falco ( Sopranos fame ) last night.  Diane Was a nervous 15 pound of shit in a three pound capacity bag. She didn't know where to put her face when it came to meeting Ms Falco. I grabbed Diane by the hand  and dragged her over to Ms Falco.   Fish: Hello Ms Falco. my name is Fish Vargas and I am a teaching artist with the Community word Project Ms Falco: Oh it is nice to meet you Fish: Let me introduce you to my partner Diane Roy. She is currently a nervous wreck and couldn't gather enough energy to come meet you Flaco: {laughs} oh, that is nice Fish: I will let you both talk. It was a pleasure to meet you Ms Falco Falco: Likewise Fish   So that could have been a highlight of the evening but plenty blew me away.  The second grade students at P.S 79 ( my old school ) put on a performance piece by Jesus Papoleto Melendez. These young kids were incredible.  Rachelle and Marina did incredible work.  I was itching to write about this one.......  This gentlemen slated to perform yesterday with his violin made his way towards the stage.  This was totally a surreal fuckin moment. He took his violin and he made it come to life. It wasn't the classical music with Bach, Mozart being influences. He channeled Hendrix, Garcia, and thought about Santana. He did three songs and I was in shock with what he did. In one set, he played the National Anthem, Amazing Grace, Dueling banjo's with his own flavor. I can't really describe it but the guy was incredible.   I had a great conversation about our different arts and he wants to come to CWP in some type of collaborative effort. I have always been amazed by artist with musical ability but this dude was beyond what any of us can undersand.  I told him that many of us as poets  strive to achieve with words what he has gone beyond with his notes. He spilled harmony, faith, hope, anger, intensity all with one violin.   Wow  Great night  Funny part of the evening. I went to retrieve my ghetto coat and off to the side were some older white gentleman playing pool. I went and sat to admire their game. One gentleman actually wanted me to play but the other whiter gentleman were not feeling that. I guess if he saw I had the balls to sit and watch their game, I must have some ability.  The older white dude ( Vinny ) said " not to have hard feelings but it was just a game amongst beginners". I knew if I would have got on that table I would have killed them. I would have channeled every bit of anger from Slavery, racism, bias comments, harassment and played it into my pool game. I play much better when I am angry.   But........... I didn't play. They sucked really really bad too. The table was beautiful also. They didn't deserve to play on such a beautiful table. All the money in the world would never help these pompous scrubs.   Aight.... I'm out....  take care   Fish  Peace , Love, Porkchops

      I normally write about what has happened to me personally but this kind of threw me aback yesterday when I saw it.  The hottest topic these days seems about same sex couples marrying each other.  In San Francisco it steam rolled to where several thousand people were married. Somewhere down the line Bush ( the guy that makes beleive he is President ) wanted to add an amendment to the constitution banning same sex marriages. Wow, that is really pushing the issue in my eyes.  Iraq will not bring down Bush but if he bans same sex marriages - he is through.  Anyway......several weeks ago at Q2, I was inspired to write a piece about my brother and his exposing of his lifestyle choice. It is actually more about the hatred we both have for each other but that is not the point.  More fuel for the fire as they say.........  Yesterday at the Bronx County courthouse were two demostrations in support and against same sex marriages. No where to my recollections has there been a demonstration against same sex marriages but in the Bronx we have em. That shit irked me. Most of the people demonstrating were latino and black. 90% of them were toting bibles -hypocrites. It seems that in most latino and black families, we all have a gay cousin or two. They are ok as long as they don't marry it seems. I honestly can fathom why the fuck people feel the need to intrude in others people's lifestyle choices. You are not gay, what the fuck, let other people do as they please.  Here is the kicker, the asshole that organized the anti-same sex marriage demonstration was Ruben Diaz.  He is a councilman from the Bronx that I grew up with and I am in current talks with him about finding some housing for Acentos. Now, after he did this, that puts me in an interesting predicament. The poetry community is very heavy with the LGBT. Imagine this bastid talking shit about people that I consider family.    Things just get more interesting everyday of my life  Oh  Wrestlemania sucked ass yesterday.

      Some poets are far more insane then others. I have come to that conclusion yesterday as Luis ( El Extreme ) Chaluisan was hosting yet another Pedro Pietri Tribute.   Egads!! That dude has some issues. He is part comedian, part poet, part host, part nutcase.  When I first got there it was weird to me because I keep on learning about new things in the Bronx. Not that it was totally new but new to me because I never knew it existed before. The event was held at the Bronx River Arts center. I never knew they had and arts center in the Bronx and you learn something new everyday.  When it started this one chic did a poem by Julia De Burgos and regardless of how hot she looked ñ I donít think she will ever come close to doing Julia justice. After her bit ñ we were ushered to the 4th floor, no elevator mind you. If I catch a heart attack I am fuckin somebody up. Sit, if Rich catches a heart attack that motherfucker is going to die because I am not carrying HIS ASS!!! We made it safe and they yanked another 5 dollars from the pocket and the evening started with a film called ì El Celloî. Que fuckin basura! It was about a young dominican chic playing the cello downtown for money. She encounters a homeless guy and they work in together and they make decent money. Some kid comes and takes her purse and she runs after him. She returns and the homeless guy stole her cello. She comes home and her mother calmly hits her with the ì I told you so ì.  What miffed me was the unrealstic nature of this short film. No matter how much class they wanted to portray in this family ñ the dominican mother would have been screaming her head off.   AnywayÖÖafter the film, several people went up and it was cool. ThenÖ. The young Acentos Poets that ì he hopes continue to writeî. Rich read his poem about Lolita and the old barrio. I went and did the Bronx Piece. Oscar went down the sorta rican route. Jess Browned skinned it.   After we all finished Luis calls us all back to the stage. So here are all the Acentos poets and he gives us a message from Pedro in the form of a message.  When it was happening it was surreal. When it sunk in ñ I was embarassed as holy fuck. Strip me naked and show off the small penis instead if you want pero conoÖÖ. This dude has issues. We get off the stage and you can tell that we were all like. ì What the fuck was that about ?î  Some more poets and performers paid tribute and the evening was good. Carmen Pietri, Sam Diaz and Pedroís Brother Showed up. We had a nice time with them as Carmen pulled out some old pics of Pedro from the 50ís. Thoe pics had no price as they were hilarious. I straight up Carmen that I am ghetto and I have no problem stealing a few so keep them away rom me. She laughed and we made our way off to eat.     I tried to sum up the evening in my head but there was no need to. It was an honor of Pedro and we had a great time as he wanted all of us to have. Luis had some good moments and I give him props. It was early so we hit a diner and it was cool. We spoke about the show, poetry, and slam. It was a good close to my evening as no one got on my nerves.  Today is the shin dig as Seveís and we are going to enjoy the high testosterone filled environment and act a fool.  Catch ya soon  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      wow  Good evening last night. For the sake of that matter, it was actually a good day in general.  Giving credence to all that is surreal, let me start with Bluestocking Book store with the latest installment of Soul Nation.  Since I left my job a little bit late making some new flyers for what seems to be the newest and most controversial reading in NYC ñ add some traffic ñ presto............Fish is late. we all know how much Fish hates being fuckin late.  I got there in Time to hear some very powerful sistas read some poetry. Being biased as I am............ My two favorite readers were Nina and Our Jess.  Those two girls are at the forefront of everything that poetry should be. They both had a short set but delved into humor, introspection, imagery and love. I am loving those two more and more every day. I would love to stay with them and engage in all the general jackassery in loisada but I made a commitment to an opportunity that kinda fell out of my cell phone.  Yesterday at the Nuyorican Poets cafe was a theme slam on redemption. It was 10 poets vying for an opportunity to compete against other poets to promote and go on tour for this movie about Tookie Williams. This is the kat that co-founded the crips L.A Street gang that is currently on Death Row. Yet, from death row he has authored several childrenís books and has been nominated for the Nobel prize three times.   So......Poets competing with there poems on Redemption???? Ainsley Burrows, Yolanda K Wilkinson, Kamal, Daniel Beaty, Dinorah, Itsrealight, Baron, Lamb and Fish. Celena Glenn got some food poisioning so she couldnít make it.  When the poets are called to the stage and I see who I am going up against, the first thing that went through my mind was ......... ì 9 poets..... maybe 3 might read about redemptionî.   I love Ainsley to death but if he reads that 9/11 poem one more time...... I am going to cut him. He scored a 28.1 and going first- that was a decent score.  Most of the night was a blur to me but I do remember the scores the judges gave over some interesting poetry. Daniel beaty went up there and screamed and break neck speed and got a 29.7.  The best poetry of the night had to come from Yolanda and this lovely girl named Dinorah.  Other then that , I was disappointed to hear Itsrealight do her signature piece which had not one ounce of redemption. Lamb did the same poem........again ( nice guy but he needs to write more ). Everytime I see him, same pieces.   5 poets moved into the second round. I didnít get a 29.7 but I did get higher then a 28.2. I brought my little book up there and read poetry. I didnít scream, rant, rave, yell. I read slowly and gave the best performance from the page that I could remember. So moving into the second round was Daniel, Kamal, Fish, Itsrealight,Lamb. I drew 9th in the first round so after they switched it on me...... I had to go first in the second round. I didnít mind since I was basking in the glory of just making it there.  I read my ìI am ì piece and it went over well. Some chic gave me an 8.9 but the lowest score gets dropped.  Daniel went up there and got a 30. Kamal got a 29.7, Lamb got a 29.6, itsrealdark got a 29.5 ( I think ). Fish got a 29.4. I swear I am a loser.   All in all....... The slam was ok. I wish more poets would stay within the theme and keep it real. Regardless of how I lost, meeting Carol king and having her tell me she loved my work was surreal.  I met Jamie Foxx manager and he gave me his card, I gave him an Acentos Flyer.  Weird transaction but it was worth it.  Plugging Acentos all night had many people laughing. Those little flyers are a god send and I thinking making more of them seems like a good idea. ì I loved your work fishî , really?.......... here is a flyerî  Coming home was interesting too as keep getting more and more pissed with certain people. Yet, I am not paying anything mind. I have better things to get me upset.  Today is the tribute at the Bronx River Arts Center. I am reading a new piece because nina hasnít hard me read. Gotta keep on top of those people that want to hear your work progressing.   Iím out....wrestlemania TOMORROW!!!!!!! .

      When eric and I hang out we act a straight  fool. Last night he came to pick me up and we had a ball. Driving around and laughin at all the NYC nightlife has to offer. I even passed by the Nuyorican really quick but driving around talking was the better part of my night.  Yesterday when we were heading home I convinced Eric to pick up the Acentos Collage that I put together for the anniversary show. I bring it outside to put in the back seat of the car. He want to lay it across the floor of the back and I want to put it in the seat.  After some verbal back and forth about the baby seat...... he tells me to pop the trunk. I ask him " Why?". He screams... " where the fuck am I going to put the baby seat?" I started cracking up. I laughed because he screamed at me and he feels that comfortable with me. Any one else...... I would have looked at them like..... "what the fuck?"  Our travels took us to a couple of places and the night was good. Joking with him had to be the highlight of my month.   Then again.... the stripclub was n't that far behind.   Peace

      ..............and woke up in one of those moods that no matter what happens, my day will be good. Even after I mistakenly grab the ketchup packet thinking it was grape jam and squeeze it onto my morning biscuit. For the record....... biscuits and ketchup do not go well together.  As more moments of surrealism come to grace Acentos - last night was a doozy. As we were lucky enough to have Jack Agueros feature for us - excitement filled the air.  A strong open mic with a virgin hosting session from our own Rich Villar paved the way for another strong Acentos.  Introduction of feature...... ten minutes later..... he was done.  Our faces were somewhere between "uh..uhhhh......uhhhhh" and " holy shit ". It was handled smoothly regardless and I am happy the evening was strong.  Most likely at the next Acentos I will read my next poem involving my brother, our disdain for each other, and him coming out of the closet.  I haven't read at Acentos since my feature and that is way too long.  The next poem is going to touch on some personal feelings between my brother and I. Yes..... I have a brother.  He is 40 years old and lives in Puerto Rico. He did 8 years in jail for real estate fraud, embezzlement, and an array of other charges. He recently came home to reveal that he was gay. I guess my shot at ever being an uncle is shot to shit after that declaration.   Him and I never got along. In 98 we fought one inch from taking each others life. He lifted his hands at my moms and that was definitely not happening. I think about the " what if's" and I preferred those to what really happened.  When I saw him take a swing at my mother - he lost his blood as a brother. He lost his right as my family. With every punch against his face, I gathered the strength to hit him again and again and again. The taste of his blood similar to my own. His cries to my mother of " take him off me ". My mother taking his bloodied side after I protected her. His accusations towards my mother of abandonment after she fled Puerto Rico to the safety of NYC fleeing a man that had broken her jaw, left her hospitalized, battered, broken and once , almost dead.   Hate is a strong word. I am not afraid to use it.   "Ricardo Mercado of toa Baja Levittown Puerto Rico. I fuckin hate you and I should have kept  hitting you until you stopped breathing, until your heart stopped, until your face disappeared from my memory, until every single disgusting act you conspired against me is paid back, until my knuckles cracked redemption against your bones, until our blood tangles remorse on the concrete. When God begs me to stop but he even knows I am right"  Sighhhhh  Fish

      I am really looking forward to just chillin these days. last night I had to remove everything from my living room to make room for the painters to come and do their thing. There are two times in your life in which you realize you are the owner of too much shit  1 When you move 2 When you paint  Don't get it twisted, I don't have the patience. I also know that I have tooooooo much shit and I will clean house soon.  Good night at 13 last night. Regular format with a solid open mic of newbie's. I love to see new people come to the mic. Guerrrrrreeerrrrii was really welcoming to the "virgins" and they all did quite well for first timers. Doesn't seem that long ago that Fish and Oscar rolled into Bar 13 and read some bullshit and Guy thought we were pretty good. After being around for two years.... I think Guy was full of shit. I read the poem recently that I read on that open mic two years ago- it sucked geriatric ass really bad. It didn't politely suck cute little suckling sunction kisses. It sucked with two hands opening the buttcheeks and me inserting a straw into a hemmoroid riddled asshole reaking of preparation - H and giving some decrepit old lady an oral enema! I still thank the Met fan.   The slam was ok last night. Ainsley rocked out with some of his big gun oldies. Carlos impressed me in the 3rd round with new work. Bonafide pulled the big guns to ensure a 2nd place finish.  Some new kat came onto the slam and he was decent. Probably caught the movie Slam  a tad much but it was good to see a new face up there.   Last night Jai went up there and dropped his best performance that I have ever seen. That motherfucker rights some next level poetry that is soooooooo fucking good that it passes right through the judges. Taylor asked me last night who I thought was robbed. Without a moment of hesitation- Jai!  Incredibly enough, Taylor agreed with me. It was a common consensus the judges were losing the poem through Jai over the top use of his hands. Jai's words are powerful enough to kill a judge without the "roger in the matrix" mode. In passing conversation with Jai I asked him to consider it and he took the opinion/advice well. I think Jai is the only one that hurts me physically when he gets scored low in slams with some incredible work.    As for my slam career this year might close with very little drama. I slammed this year 4 times and garnered 2 point with a 2nd place finish in the last slam in 2003.  In order for me to compete I have to be in the top 15 . As where we stand right now........ I am # 12. I should be happy right ?? The rankings haven't been updated since January 20 and I really have no clue where I stand in them. So, once the update comes........ we see. I am not sweating it. There is so much more then being on a team for me. Funny how things change. Last year I was gunning for the Union square team hard core. Now...... shit has just changed.   Acentos has made me see such a bigger picture in the poetry community. Teaching has changed my perspective. Working hard to be the best has taken charge.   Life is still good. I am happy and I am still learning more and more.   So....   Peace, Love, Porkchops, pernil, Poetry  Fish  P.S Sean Thomas Dougherty is a fucking Genius!

      After about three weeks of planning, prodding, poking, thinking..... what's done is done. As respect goes far and wide for certain private matters: this is one of those times. People have to realize the love that exudes from them effects their smaller and contrite communities. Therefore..... the community will return that love.   I had a interesting day yesterday as it was filled with emotion, anger, worries, and anxiety. Welcome to the full fledged emotional roller coaster scream machine known as "the mind of Fish"  As I got home yesterday and I was battling this ebola that tried to take over my body. I sat and thought about the love that everyone has for me when things are great and I am healthy.  The other spectrum begs for misery as you know where I am going with it.  Will you come see me when I am dead??? Will you take ten minutes of your life and visit me for one last time?? My body laying stiff in an overpriced box wearing one of the court suits I own. I have on a  generous amount of cheap make-up. My body is swollen and you could barely recognize me.  Would you want to remember me in that manner?  I heard someone say yesterday that " they don't see dead people" so going to Pedro Pietri's wake was primarily out of the question. I can't blame this person because many people can't deal with that situation. Where did we learn to mourn the passing of someone  and view their " body" one last time?  Isn't that kinda sick if you come to think of it?  I tell everyone over and over again that I don't want a viewing. I don't want a funeral. Take the fat puerto Rican man from the morgue to the incinerator and burn him. Take my ashes and spread them in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, El Faro en el Combate in Puerto Rico, Watson Ave,  Bar 13, Acentos....... mix it up with some hydro and smoke away baby.  You can love me in life but you will celebrate me in death. Seriously, why cry when you know what I wanted? No matter what the circumstances were in my death- you can relish that I thought enough about my death to let everyone know what I wanted.   Poetry...... wow.... no poet readings in honor of me. Fuck that. You know that fish just wants people to hang and remember him as long as Possible. Drink a pepsi for me.  Be happy knowing that I have died doing something I love around people that have helped me.   No will, no money, no tears, no hate...... just live your life as I lived mines. Happy, joyful, helpful.  Love ya niggers  Word  Peace

      Pedro Juan Pietri Aponte (1944-2004)  It is with deep sorrow that I inform you that Pedro Juan Pietri Aponte, our  beloved poet has been excused from further pain and sorrow. While on a journey  coming back home. It was to be a temporary timeout from a rigorous, intensive  and expensive treatment. For him time is no longer of any concern, he belongs  to eternity.   His family, friends and poets from all over the world will grieve the absence  of his laughter, genius and art, but the memory remains with all of us.  Whether you met him for a moment or a lifetime you were a part of him.   On behalf of his family I would like to Thank You for all the kindness, help  and support that you have extended to him, especially in these last couple of  months as he fought for his life. I am a witness that your kindness was very  touching to him. He did not know that he was so admired, so loved by so many  people.   We will keep you informed as arrangements are finalized, through the Pedro  Pietri Health Benefit voicemail (212-340-1237).   There will be a public viewing at First Spanish United Methodist Church (The  People's Church) 163 E. 110th St. from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM   On behalf on the Pietri Family and In the Service of Poetry, Art and  Community  Sam Diaz

      La cabeza is about to explode. Seriously, like in the move " big trouble in little China" ,my head is going to swell up to the size of a melon and explode. Why you ask?? After reading the angry pumpkin and a thread from that stegasaurous character....... opinions and ideas flow heavy from poets.  My two cents are thrown into the mix from my own perspective.  Since many people are using Acentos as a staple to where you can go to feel warmth, love and community - don't even ask me how we are doing it.    Poetry has been at the forefront of me changing for the better.  I always loved writing and tickled the pen way before I stepped foot into Bar 13. I have the BADDDDDDDD poetry to prove it.   When my feet jumped into that cold lake of "uppercase" on Nov 25, 2002 - I thought my world was perfect.  When and where did I want a concentration on Latino writers and poets is somewhat vague right now. I know somewhere within me was an animosity brewing when I went  to a venue and the latin writers are as scarce as a Republican with public support for all political parties.   Did I go out there specifically with the intent on starting a series?? No. Did I throw the idea around in my head and wished it would come true?? Yes.  One new bar, one open-minded bar owner, Oscar's first Wednesday feature, several ideas, mission statements, vision statements and plenty of fights...... BANG! ACENTOS BABY! The place where we show love to everyone that walks through the door. Latino or not you are getting love.  Poets across the board will always be welcomed on the open mic.   All this with write-ups and media with no slam. Hmmmmm..... Makes ya think.   Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      When I was flicking through the channels and I came upon another reality show - I almost threw up. Literally, I gagged, hacked, and almost up-chunked my tortillas.  They had ,on Fox 5, the Garden of Eden which was typical reality show mierda.    When I tuned in it was right ot the time where someone was getting shafted ( voted off ). This one chic was doing the casting away and she lambasted this one dude harshly.  She said he lacked integrity, she said he wasn't worthy of her and so on. So she chose to Banish him. WAIT!!!!!!!! The host of the series says in the Garden of Eden there is always a chance of being spared. They brought out two envelopes and she had to pick " Spare or  Banish" and not show anyone what she picked.   Now, they bring out another envelope and give it to the guy to read..........  " Here at the Garden of eden if you have chosen to banish you will also be banished. If you have chosen to spare , you yourself will also be spared "   OH SHIT!!! PLOT TWIST!!!!!!!!!!  When she turned around that envelope and it said........................ BANISH............ I WAS SCREAMING.... HA!!!! HA!!!!!!! HA!!!!!!!   She passed judgement and shot herself in the foot.   Reality shows are really sucking these days. Even the Playboy reality show of 7 lives exposed is really sucking.   Oh well.... I should start getting into politics because things are getting boring.

      So, say you were meeting a new person - blind date, new friend, who knows. And you wanted them to have some idea of what kind of person you are, and who you are. But you can't actually tell them in so many words. Instead, you have to give them a box, with a dozen things in it for them to ponder over.  What would you put in the box? No cheating - you're not allowed to include things such as links to your livejournal.  WHAT I'D PUT IN MINE: 01. Extensive Playboy collection 02. my two favorite guns ( Desert Eagle .50 & Glock 23 ) 03. C-train and 13 Mexicans by Jimmy Santiago Baca 04. 3 liter pepsi 05. Public enemy / Rebel without a pause 06. Puerto Rican Flag 07. Scarface VHS TAPE!!! 08. KY Jelly 09. Picture of my Parents/ Eric and his family 10. Sterling silver pen I treasure 11. All the Acentos Flyers I have saved 12. My first Chapbook  Added few for your entertainment  All my porn tapes ( That box better be big ) the sex tape of me and Lenny ( She will be calling me as soon as she reads this ) The keys to all my cars   Peace, Love, Porkchops!

      Should I get serious???? Should I keep it real???  Well, let me just try to get this out in unadulterated " fish " style.  Headed to catch the 4 pm showing of " The Passion of Christ" yesterday. I got tickets for the 9:30pm show instead because it was sold out until then. Yes folks, not even the props that I have at the movie theaters help me yesterday.  With all the hoopla surrounding Mel Gibson's latest installment of Gorefest I was rather determined to see this flick.  I always loved to see violent movies because I have a morbid love for anything gory and violent. Put it this way - my dad took me to see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre when I was 4 at the movie theater, nuff said.  The professor, the paranoid one and myself headed to Cross county and we made our way into the theater.  Center row for optimal viewing of what was billed as one of the most violent movies of all time. I have heard this and I was pessimistic at the fact this could even impress me. To keep with the religious theme of this blog entry.......holy shit!  I don't have a religious bone in my body. I believe in what I believe in and that is because I choose to. I lost my faith a long time ago. Yet, I still have some knowledge as to the story of the famed Jesus Christ.  I followed the movie very closely open minded after I saw Jesus turn a Albino Boa python into a pancake. He stomped the shit out of this snake and from there on end I knew this movie was going to be different.  According to the movie, Jesus was betrayed by that Judas character and turned over to what I think were the Jewish folk. They wanted him put to death but the Romans weren't quite feeling that. So the Romans wanted to just "punish severely" Jesus. This is where the movie got extremely interesting.  If you are not religious, that shit doesn't matter. If you are religious, you will embrace Jesus even more. They said that Jesus paid for everyone's sins and that burden was carried by him and him only. If those burdens were in the form of beatings - he carried the sins of the world. He was beaten so bad that any other man in all of history would have died. Not Jesus, he got up after the first beating to get a worse beaten.     Jesus is brought back and After some internal battles the Roman consul gave in and did what the Jewish folk wanted. They wanted Jesus Crucified and put to death.   I think you can get the idea of what else happened throughout the movie.  The extent of violence in this movie was beyond even my violence embracing comprehension.  The only thing I kept on think was..... "there is no need to keep on beating him like that". Wow, Fish nurturing that compassionate nerve that barely ever surfaces from those deep ghetto doldrums.    I started thinking once he is crucified that it will be over. Even that PG version they have given us throughout the years was harsh.  Could it get worse when you are nailed to a fuckin cross??? Well, when they turned the cross over and Jesus was the floor face first with the cross on his back - I said...... "this movie is Poetry"   The passion of Christ was an epic poem at it's best. If someone can write with such an intense vivid imagery that Mel Gibson used in this movie, that person will be our modern day picasso of poetry. Every detail of one's man's suffering. Every metaphor and awe catching moment was caught in this movie. It was powerful, it was dramatic, it was moving, everything that a poem has to be..... this movie had it.  I am not religious but this movie caught everything in one man's vision and gave it to us in the form of a fuckin masterpiece.   Oh...was the movie anti- Semitic? I don't know what to say. Does the movie portray all Jews as ignorant power hungry religion mongers? No. The movie portrays those Jewish folks that persecuted Jesus as executioners of faith other then theirs.   Well, the movie was crazy. IF you are religious and want to appreciate what your Christ sacrificed for you, I wold suggest go check this flick out. It says plenty of what one man with true beliefs is willing to die for.

      Last night was my trek to the Bowery to catch their Megathermonuclearapocalypcticdisastermierda slam.  I got there a little bit late because I  got caught up in my house with these two hot porn stars and threesomes take a while to get over. Aye relaxÖ.. I am just joking.  Got to the Bowery and I was bored. A fuckin semi-final slam and I was bored! Not even my little game of guess the score of the poet going up could keep me interested.  1 year on this scene thrown in the mix and I am already bored with the poems. I can only imagine what is going through the minds of poets that have been here for 7 years.  I hope the finals next week at Urbana are much more interesting and I am looking forward to hearing probably one person. This white boy Chad went up there and he was ok. He made finals so he has something to offer. The only reason I am looking forward to it is because itís new work I havenít heard over and over again. ì Chad, if you are on this scene next year with the same poems, I will be bored of you too ì.  I told Ed Garcia that if 4 years from now if I am slamming and I pull out my Bronx poems from the deep dark black kettle of poetry; he can stab me in my throat. I give him permission to grab my own nice and stab me in my throat going from left to right. Please make sure the esphogas falls out to ensure death.  I try to ply myself as the ever loving, community building, poetry loving Fish that hugs everyone. Yet, I cringe to hear the same thing over and over again. This is what I  get for attending too many slams.    A piece of me understands some strategy used in slams. If you have one poem you are certain will garner a 9.9; fuck it; pull that motherfucker out. It is a competition and the one who is willing to go all out is going to win. The only thing I question isÖÖ ì When are you going to pull out a pen and write something new?î.  One of my biggest fears wasÖ ì Oh, that is the Puerto Rican dude with the awesome Bronx poem ". Well, that has changed with the addition of another Bronx poem that is getting more accolades then the original Bronx poem.   Celena won the slam again. Taylor came in second and I was happy for him. Even though he did his usual cut throat strategy; I rooted for him. Why?? Well, I never seen Taylor slam. Last year he was all over the place and he couldnít slam at urbana. He failed to make the team. This year he did his thing and he is in the finals.  Big congrats to Mrs Post Midnight who is expecting an offspring in September. I have compiled a list of baby names for your choosing:  Baby names:  1 Fish 2 Fish Midnight 3 Fish Post 4 Post Fish 5 Midnight Fish 6 Mid Fish 7 Mid NightFish 8 Bob  Well, I am off to kill some little old ladies who just received their monthly social security checks. Then I am going to Rikers to teach some inmates the wonderful art of Poetry  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      oh man, Denzel Washington is the man. I have always liked him and his more previous movies have made me a bonafide groupie. His last movie training day was straight madness. Last night I catch " Man on Fire" and he makes the role memorable. The lines will go right down next to......  " Go Ahead punk, Make my day " " You talking to me ? " " Say hello to my little friend "  Yesterday was my day to be surprised somewhat by my Brother Eric who came to pick me up.  He called me and said he was headed to Manhattan and he will stop by and pick me up to just hang a little. I am outside waiting for him and I am on the lookout for a Galant just like mine. This motherfucker pulls up in a 2004 Nissan Murano. I stated screaming like a little girl going on a first date. That mid-size SUV is straight up a man's toy.  I was so happy because that was my first choice for him to buy when he asked me what he should get. The color he got it was a hot metallic royal blue. He needs some chrome really bad because he is riding on factory bullshit.  I am putting some calls out to see if I can get a good ghetto deal. Some foose speedster J.J 19's would look crazy. Oh- I am sorry; if you don't know what I am talking about - do the research.  After about 1 hour of talking over the new hooptie we head out to the B.X and get some small business out of the way. We met up with Mike Collins as he needed a look at the new wheels. I was starving and we headed to get some pizza and who walks out?? Fuckin Willie Perdomo and John Rodriguez. I start Screaming; " I can't STAY AWAY, I CAN'T STAY AWAY"!!! They start laughing and we speak some poetry lingo back and forth. Nice is when Willie points out that he heard I was in Semi's. Yes, the head swelled. Some other comments were made but I REFUSE TO APPEASE Pumpkins.   After a well placed phone call to the move theater; Eric and I fly to catch this flick. The movie is well worth the reviews it got and worth your 10 bucks. Oh, I didn't pay a dime because it is who you know and not what you have to pay.   After he drops me off I start thinking alot of the love I have for that kat. I never had a problem letting people know how much I care for them and how much they mean to me. Sometimes I will go out of the blue and just tell Eric I love him. As my brother and leaning tree; he means more to me then most people on this planet. Then there are the other folks that have found a piece in my heart that I can't deny. Tom, Mike, Oscar, Rich have all been there for me in a certain way. I think they can rest comfortably knowing that I will go to the end of whatever middle earth I have to destroy to ensure they are cool. The girls in my life have been the staple of my living.  I always use the girls as a template on how to keep true friendships. One of my best friends that is a girl many of you don't even know.  Then, the girls on the scene are becoming sisters amongst themselves and accepting us with our Jackassery.  Jess, Maria, Nina, Lenny, Lynne, hold this spot also.  Then the stragglers that I care for deeply......  Damn  I am not even going to list it. You motherfuckers all know I have love for you.  My life is good and it seems the life of my friends are exceptionally well. It can't get better then what it is now.  Fish  * A charger is a hollow plastic tube people use to transport drugs and illegal shit into jail via your asshole.  C-4 is an explosive  Figure out what denzel did

      ........going against all grains of what is right; I come home to write about Acentos instead of doing a show analysis.  When you are a part of something that is bigger then you; being humble is all we got. Acentos always leaves me humbled everytime I come home.  Some days more then others but today it was a good day to bid myself a humble messenger.  Today was the day that Acentos paid much respect to what many consider the first ladies of our little venue.  Jessica Torres, Nina, Maria Maria Nieves held center court today and gave back something that I will hold dear for a long time- appreciation, love, respect.   So much work goes into a feature and it takes confidence and prudence to make it look easy. All three of them worked harder then what I could imagine. I canít give them enough credit and kudos for a beautiful set they did today.  In looking back; today was much bigger then what I thought it could ever be. Today wasnít about our featureís; it was about the community amongst the women that make Acentos great.  I got a huge surprise with Lenny coming to the mic and reading a poem introduction for the features. That is when it hit me like a bag of anthologies; the women in our series are sisters. From far to near; From there to here. All our women that come through have this essential bond that is making Acentos stronger.  So to the first ladies of Acentos:  ì Thank you for making us realize there is only one way to loveî  Let me work  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Ahhhhhhh........ Good night with some memorable performances. I will try to describe it but if you were not there- you might be lost.  It was a good night with a packed house. Seems like whatever we are doing is working and the crowd is coming in. When I dropped the door; I counted 74 people walking through the door.  The open mic was solid yesterday with more then 15 people coming in. The first guy to to " jerk the curtain " was the illegitamate love child of Rich and Chance. Picture Rich and chance being morphed into one: got it?? Well, that is the guy that opened yesterday. He was a member of the Delray beach team and came up to NY to slam.  Uh.... I hope he realized it's a little bit too late.  Before things got crazy. The performance of the night award goes to Luis Cartegena. This motherfuckin guy killed me yesterday. He started this great poem about life and a cheese sandwich. Then he pulled out a cheese sanwich and ate it on stage. Not a quick bite and he ran off. He just took his time and it was the best I have seen. Bastard got me hngry too!  The slam was just that ......... A FUCKIN SLAM!!!  Damn  It wasn't one of those slams where the typical shit happened. The stars were actin up and the forces of the old slam deities came out hard core.  When the festivities start with RAC Dropping a piece and staying on stage intimidating  the judges; you knew the night was going to be weird.  RAC Sacrifices her inner most demons to a 24.2 and the shooting begins. Now you fucks: don't hold my math as the official scoring  Round 1 Jai		25.4 Rog		27.6 Rich		26.5 Mahogany	27.0 Mike Cirelli	26.5   Round 2 Rog		27.3 (54.9) Mahogany	26.4	(53.4) Rich		26.6	(53.1 ) Mike		27.3	( 53.8 ) Jai		27.0	( 52.4)   Round 3 Rog		27.3	(82.2) Mike		27.5  (81.3) Mahogany	26.2	(79.6) Rich		26.5	(79.6) Jai		28.0	(80.4 )  in the previous round jai pulled some tactics out of his ass and he will definitely be the talk of the town for a long time to come!  Round 4 Rog		27.3	(109.5) Mike		25.9	(107.2) Jai		27.2	(107.6) Rich		27.0	(106.6) Mahogany	27.3	(106.9)  Well, My math might be right but maybe a time penalty in the last round changed shit or something.  Roger took First Mike took Second Jai with the leap frog of death jumped into third  So the last semi finals is over and done with and now the cut throat tactics begins.  I have to enlist the help of some of my buddies to threaten some of the slammers. Maybe even show up at some residences at 4am. How about a doghead hung from the doorknob with a note " Slammers end up like this "!  Finals on May tenth  Rog Celena RAC Bonafide George Mike Cirelli Jai Abena Fish  There is a little bit of everything in this slam. What is the best feeling I have right now?? No matter who makes the team- I feel they will be able to represent Louderarts fully!  I am happy........ I Am nervous.  Shit  I am in it knee deep!   Peace, Love, Porkchops

      Wow,   Last nights dream was off the hook! I was dreaming Ricardo montalban and I found 90 gold brincks. We were picking them up and hundreds of hitmen came in. We started throwing gold bricks at them and knocking their heads off.  Segue to the next dream and I was lifted away to a park where I had a rifle and I was shooting some people getting a tan.  The dream was interesting.  - Sopranos is still sucking ass.  - Punk'd came back with a vengeance.  Matthew Perry is the biggest pussy I have ever seen in my life.  - Wild Boyz have issues. They were in India and acted a fool. One part of the show has Steve-O lick the feet of a young boy that had elephantisis ( huge feet ). It made me nauseous  - Read Oscar's blog while he was going to D.C. The Acentos Fungus is growing.  - I still don't have my cell phone  - I might go to Great Adventures with Guy and the CRU. We need to get on some rides and throw up all over each other.  - I am nervous about finals. ANy advice from you fuckers?  - I found a small tweety bird a couple of months back and I gave it to Lenny. Turns out those Tweety Birds are from Starbucks.  They had the whole looney toones Collection. Marvin the Martian rocks.  - This kat  in my job bet 9 people in my Job 20 bucks each the Yankees will not get shut out this year. He didn't come in today. I guess he is trying to get some money together.   - Yankees, Mets, Knicks all suck this year.  - My ex called me and left a message " Hi Fish, I just called to say hello, We haven't spoken for a while and I wanted to see how you were doing". Uh...... I sent her a scathing letter that basically sent her to hell in 45 different ways and she stills calls me. Women have issues.  - My mother is so cool. I saw her this morning going to the doctor to get her check-up. I really love my moms. I appreciate her more now then before.  She wants to stay alive to see her grand kids, she is going to hate me I guess.  - Eric is my nigger  - Rich Is my new hero Pimp  - Oscar and I are cool  - Guy better show up to Acentos because if he doesn't come tomorrow I am going to start a rumor that will deal with him being naked in a room with donkey and much K.Y jelly.  - My cousin came home from Iraq. He has spoken more then three sentences in the 7 days he has stepped foot in the house. My aunt said he stood in bed for 3 days without moving.   Peace

      ......... some bodies are rotting!!!!  LOL  Yes, yesterday was the Bronx River Alliance Flotilla Festival 2004. We were tapped to perform some poetry about the Bronx or the River itself.  Rich and I stepped up to the plate and we were there at 12:45 on stage doing our thing. It was early so not many people were  in the front rows. It was still packed all over with tables with Arts and crafts, painting,  free give-aways, and food.   The best thing after performing and getting some love from people was getting home to message on my machine......  ì Fish, you and Rich were great and I want to talk to you about coming down to Community Teaching and talk about starting a poetry program. ì  Ahhhhhhhh........... A sigh of  success as my words are once again taking us somewhere. As always, I will save my optimism when I am already teaching and getting paid for it.   Sure enough, next year will be a year of  Poetry and music performing on stage.  They had no musicians, singers, or anything. I spoke to Elyse and she was adamant about trying to get something together. She wasnít quite experienced with putting together a show.  I figure with Ray, SynonymUS, Peter, Scott, Maya, Abby, Rebecca Hart and every other resource I could tap, we can take a good part of the show. I am shooting for a 4 hour slot of poetry, collabos, Jamming, singing.  Mark these words people.  I am good  I went with my Dad yesterday to Levitz and brought the old fucker a leather recliner he has been gushing over. I also got the reservations for my mothers trip to Puerto Rico. I am back to being officially broke as I spent 1300 bucks yesterday.   I was a little bothered when I couldnít find my cell phone but it is in the lost and found of Levitz so I have to go pick it up.  Let me run  Peace   Fish

      Yes folkly folks,  The late night post because I am bored. I was about three seconds from heading to this beat box conference but I came home to reast. I got tired and for some reason I wasn't feeling it.  I went to the Bowery to take part in this slam anonce I leave somewhere- going back is not an option. I got kinda cranky during this CWP meeting and going home was better.   The slam at the Bowery was kinda cool. Regie Gibson came in and took a good part of the foolery. The high school kids were very attentive and that always makes me happy. The slam was a typical three rounds with the best two going head to head in the last round.  Farbeon and I made it to the last round and I nudged him for the win. The Q & A session was the best part. Everything was asked from influences, inspiration, writing exercises.  Farbeon is really rokcing out with this outreach after-school program. The young adults were geared to a direction of " love writng first, everything comes second "  All is good  Peace

      Where does my heritage start? Where does my culture start? Forgive me blog world for I will sin. It has been too long since my last post where I acted in a decent manner.   Yesterday was my trek to Sarah Lawrence college to support Hermano Garcia in a Latino Symposium. I got there a little late and I have no one to blame but me. I still had a chance to  Ed, Jorge Monterossa, Carlos Callejo, and Cesar. Please forgive me for not getting your last name.  Much  of the conversation touched on holding on to heritage and culture. At least that is what I got out of it. Some things were said and my mind wandered to places where I haven't been in a while. A place where my Puerto Rican heritage comes into question. Everyone knows that I am more Puerto Rican then the island itself. I live everyday to die and have my ashes carried on the shoulders of the winds of Cabo Rojo; my father place of birth.   My dad always told me stories of how he grew up. The times where the family would get together during noche Buena and party for hours on end. Stories of how him and his father; my grandfather; would kill and gut a pig and the entire barrio would come over. Special offerings to the three kings were left in the doorway. The coquito; a special concoction with rum; was touching the lips of even the smallest child. The pasteles, flan, tembleque and arroz con gandules were always cooking in the outdoor patio kitchen. The women all enjoyed their sips of vinito (wine)and would ride the bochinche waves of " ay dios mio" and " eso no puede ser". You are eating until your stomach gets full and la Parranda comes and knocks on your door.  They all put on their walking shoes and join them in song and dance until the whole barrio is at the square offering Christmas hugs and kisses with Quayos, timbales, and the cuatro's.  My Noche buenas paled in comparison. As recently as this year when every Christmas I cry to wish my days where I could have lived deep within my culture, my heritage. Where my Christmas until I was 17 were going to my uncles house and listening to Michael Jackson and hating salsa music. Where I let out a yelp of disgust when I got a bathrobe for a Christmas Present- no six year old child wants a bathrobe; give a brotha some toys. No roasted pigs but a store brought pork shoulder that needed magic to make Puerto Rico ride my tongue.  I always wondered why my father would be quiet for two or three hours during my noche buena memories, why I caught my father and uncle in the bedroom crying during the last Christmas party. Now I know.   Christmas, easter, Semana Santa will never be like the one at home. The place where I want to have my ashes carried will never be home to me. I will never be accepted by the island that I bleed for everyday.  I don't want to grasp the American dream  but I can't find acceptance from my culture who considers me an Americanized criminal.  I have read books, studied my island, cried when I got there; cried when I left, pledged my allegiance to what I know is true, que soy boriqua.  Why am I hurting?  Why is my culture one of Ghetto dreams? Why does my hair and olive skin in NYC make me Latino pero en Puerto Rico soy blanco y de aya fuera?  I speak spanglish and barely can grasp a good spanish novela.  There is so much I can change. There is so much I have to learn to keep what little I have left alive. Walking in NYC is not the same as Puerto Rico. Walking in the Bronx is not the Same as El Barrio. Walking in Puerto Rico is not the same as Spain, Africa y la aztecas.   My culture can't be concrete mountains and overhead wires. My heritage can't be dope fiends smelly hallways.  I could live my whole life in the Bronx but let me die where my heart is; La isla del encanto!  Carajo Puneta; este boriqua se respecta!  Yea, respect. Sometimes I wonder why some people insist on losing it. Well, that is another blog on another day at another time.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

        P R E - R E L A T I O N S H I P  A G R E E M E N T The party of the first part (herein referred to as "She"), being of sound mind and bangin body, agrees to the following with the party of the second part (herein referred to as "Fish"): 1. FULL DISCLOSURE 1.1 At the commencement of said relationship (colloquially referred to as the "first date"), each party agrees to fully disclose any: (1) current girl/boyfriends; (2) dependent children; (3) bizarre religious beliefs; (4) phobias and fears; (5) social diseases; (6) strange political affiliations; or (7) currently active relationships with anyone else that have not yet been terminated. (8) Fetishes 1.2 Further, each party agrees to make known any deep-seated complexes and/or fanatical obsessions with pets, careers, and/or organized sports. 1.3 Failure to make the disclosures in this clause will result in the immediate termination of said relationship before it has a chance to get anywhere. 2. INDEMNIFICATION OF FRIENDS 2.1 Both parties agree to hold the person who arranged the liaison (the "matchmaker") blameless in the event that the "fix-up" turns out to be a "real loser" or" psycho woman". (For definition of "real loser", see "John DeLorean: My Story", available at most bookstores, or any picture of Bob Guccione in "Penthouse". For definition of "psycho woman," see Sharon Stone in "Basic Instinct" or Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction.") 3.DEFINITION OF RELATIONSHIP 3.1 Should said relationship proceed past the first date, both parties mutually agree to use the following terminology in describing their said "dating": (1) For the first thirty (30) days, both parties consent to say they are "going out". (This neither implies nor states any guarantee of exclusivity.); (2) Following the first thirty (30) days, both parties may say they are "seeing somebody" and may be referred to by third parties as "an item"; (3) Sixty (60) days following the commencement of the first date, either member may elect to use the terms "girl/boyfriend" or "lover" and their mutual acquaintances may refer to them as "a couple". 3.2 Under no circumstances are the phrases "my better half," "the little woman", "the old ball and chain," or "my old man/lady" acceptable. 3.3 If both parties consent, this timetable may be sped up PROVIDED THAT if either party "gets too serious" and disregards this schedule, the other party may dissolve the relationship on the grounds of "moving too fast" and may once again be said to be "on the market." 4. TERMS OF EXCLUSIVITY 4.1 For the first thirty (30) days, both parties agree not to ask questions about the other party's whereabouts on weekends, weeknights, or over long holiday periods. No unreasonable demands or expectations will be made; "rights" or "holds" on the other party's time.  4.2 Following the first six weeks or forty-five (45) days, if one party continues to be "missing in action" the "wounded party" agrees to "give up". 5. DATING ETIQUETTE 5.1 For the first thirty (30) days, both parties agree: - to be overly considerate of the other party's work pressures, schedules, and business ambitions;  - that all dates will be made at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance;  - that there will be no "running off in the middle of the night to console an old girl/boyfriend"; and  - to strike the phrase "but he/she needs me" from their vocabularies.  5.2 Further, during the first six- (6) weeks each member of said relationship agrees to attempt one spontaneous home-cooked meal or to arrange the delivery of at least one unexpected bouquet of flowers. 5.3 Following the first forty-five (45) days, both parties will return to their normal personalities. 5.4 Either party must not insist that the other stop at a particular ATM en route (while on a date) so that they would save the $1-2 fee for using another ATM other than his/her own bank. This is viewed as cheap and could possibly pass over into areas of the relationship which a person of good upbringing is unaccustomed to and will quickly tire of.  6. TERMS OF PAYMENT 6.1 It is agreed that, respective gross income aside, "Fish" will pick up the tab at all dinners, clubs, theatres, and breakfasts until: - He considers her suitably impressed;  - He is broke; or ( This will happen after third date) -  He says, "this is ridiculous, you pay!"  6.2 This clause does not apply to meals ordered from the bedroom, which are subject to the availability of discretionary funds on hand at the time. 7.

THE 90-DAY GRACE PERIOD 8.1 For the first three months, each member of the couple agrees to hold the other blameless in the euphoric use of phrases like "Let's move in together," "Why don't we start a family?" and using archaic terminology-"Let's get married." 9. THE "L" WORD 9.1 For the first sixty (60) days, both parties agree not to use the phrase "I love you." 9.2 Without limiting the generality of clause 9.1 and to remove any doubt, the parties are permitted to love plants, dogs, cats, cars, concerts, or the way a particular pair of jeans fits, but are not permitted to state that they love each other. 9.3 Failure by one party to abide by this clause will result in the other party using the "G" word... "Gone." 10. TERMINATION 10.1 Any of the following will be grounds for immediate termination and final dissolution of said relationship: - Infidelity: Running off at any time to console an  - ex-girl/boyfriend;  - Ending any argument with any of the following  - sentences: "My ex used to do that same thing", "Now I know why your ex divorced you", or "You women store fat in your thighs, don't you?" , or " Fuck you then "

      Depending on people is always a crap shoot- you can come off or lose like an asshole. Even though my loss wasn't so detrimental but I pride myself on dependability and support.  I was suppose to go take care of some personal business yesterday but I agreed to wait around for a friend of mine to go do our deed together. Of course that motherfucker calls me and says that he is going straight home and now I am stuck at home feeling like vibrator with no batteries - worthless.  Flicking through the boob tube yesterday I caught my TV stuck on the Comedy channel. I was anxiously awaiting South park and Chappelle show. Since I haven't paid much mind to these shows and the hoopla surrounding them has been huge; time for Fish's opinion.  South Park is still insane as I remember it from several years back.  They gave the old " Nambla " episdoe with the Fat kid wanting Mature friends. Holy shit it was funny.   Chappelle's show comes up and my eyes are trained directly to the death rays omitting from that 32 inch box.  First Skit: A white family with the name " Niggar" Second Skit: Samuel L Jackson Beer  Third Skit: Wayne Brady as a gangster Fourth Skit: Chappelle being questioned as a juror  The first and third skit had me pretty amused. I always like Wayne Brady and I think he stole that whole skit away from Chappelle. The first skit was funny. It made me think if any family in america can actually have the name Niggar.   All in all, the show was ok. For him being edgy and genius is pushing it just a little. If he was on HBO his show would be cancelled within two episodes. Since he is on Comedy central; there is an edge to pushing that envelope. It's still cable in my opinion so why all the Bleeping is really beyond me.  ******************************   Tonight we are headed to Sarah Lawrence College for a latino Symposium where Ed Garcia is featuring. We are going to corrupt an incredible amount of white people tonight.  This Friday I am slamming at the Bowery. Farbeon is the Director of outreach and Development and he has high school kids coming through to see a slam. It's all in fun so I am pretty excited about it.  Saturday, Rich and I are performing for the Bronx River Alliance Festival in the Bronx: more fun  Sunday, We are headed to a petition drive in el barrio to get a school named after Pedro Pietri.   Monday, bar 13 to see Rich win the slam. Yes I predict it, my nigga Rich is going to do WHAT HE WANTS TO DO and take this motherfucker to the next LEVEL!!!!!!!!  Tuesday, Holy Shit!! ACENTOS AGAIN baby. Maria Nieves, Nina, Jessica Torres will be featuring at Acentos.  Schedule is pretty packed.   Day 13 with no release  Peace  Fish

      I was talking with a friend of mine last night and we were discussing my type of girl. I just so happened to mention my taste in the opposite sex. I didn't get detailed but I just gave a quick mention of one of my preferences that I discovered the other day.  Well, I have been in several relationships; casual or otherwise; and it has all been dramatic to say the least. My international colors of benneton penis can only hope to conquer far off lands one day.  I have dated may different colors and ethnic weirdos in my travels.  I have been with....  Puerto Ricans Dominicans Peruvians Haitians African-Americans Hondurans Japanese Chinese Koreans Cubans Jewish Ecuadoreans Irish White  Colombians  Guyanese   I think that is the extent of my list. Well, one thing I noticed is my attraction towards the women according to their ethnicity. What do I mean???? Well... here goes:  If I see a girl who is Puerto Rican and she is thick ( over 150 ), I am not so attracted to her. Now, if I see a white girl with the same exact measurements as the puerto Rican girl; I am ga-ga.    For some reason I have noticed that white girls who are thick grab my attention. Latina girls that are slimmer grab my attention. Black girls have to have a perfect mix ( whatever that is ) to grab my attention.  It is weird and I never realized that until recently. I never gave it much thought but I think it is one of those sub-conscious things that lingers unchecked.  Of course after giving all these new revelations some thought; I go back to my last relationship. She is latina but she is what I could consider thick.  Why was I attracted to her?? Well, from a glance she could look white. Then again, all of this that I just wrote could be bullshit.   A piece of me thinks it does not matter what she is; thick, thin, tall, short. As long as she has the ability to make you happy.  It's hard these days to keep me happy because I am trying to maintain happiness from within. I have given up on relationships ( Voluntarily) to pursue this poetry dedication much more. To free myself of this wanton guilt I had to make sacrifices and I feel confident over my past decisions.   *******************************  On another note: I made a pen pal with a California based pornography publicist who has a hilarious blog. Her name is  urlLink Carly Milne  and she is  funny with her views working in the adult industry. Definitely check out her blog to view the industry from and insider female perspective.  If you are not aware of it, there is an H.I.V scare crippling the industry as we speak. This dude  Darren James is said to have contracted the disease and thus far has infected one other actress in the industry. Shit is fucked up right now. Several major companies based in California have shut production down and these porn actors might have to...... GASP!!!!!........... find work.  I guess even fucking for a living has it's price. Oh wait, even if you don't do it for a living-it can be detrimental. I feel bad for them but if you think those 30 day H.I.V test are teflon shields against " the Monster" - you are a straight up moron. Sad is the girl that contracted the latest case. She is 18 years old and has worked in the industry for about 3 months. She caught it after doing a "double anal " scene with Darren James and another kat. That other dude must be praying to every deity known to man right now.   With this latest scare, it has giving the health industry to green light to pursue " Condoms are a must " policy for the production companies. This is going to be a mission because the above average porno aficianado is going to hate it. Some of the heads of the production companies will fight it tooth and nail. Where will it end up will be a mystery. I honestly think that condoms should be made a must for scenes such as double anal and shit. Then again- if 30 day H.I.V test don't cut back the risks; every Monday should be " All pornstars get check for H.I.V day". It doesn't take 2 weeks for results to come back from one lab God knows where. Now it's a 90 minute test in a clinic. It might be a hassle but it's your life. Shit, I might be wrong but that would significantly cut down the risk and exposure. If you think otherwise - well - fuck you then .  Do I have a problem using condoms??? Nope. It a hassle but sometimes you have to use them. The last person I was with saw me pull out a condom but I think it was more a fear of getting someone pregnant and having a kid. I am not trying to have kids. I should start thinking of condoms more of a protective tool then a child preventive strategy of mine.  Well,   Fish is signing off  Peace, Love, Porkchops  urlLink

      If you see alot of mistakes- I am doing my happy dance. My time to somewhat  shine I guess. I just got home and I am thinking over and over again that " I "  made finals. By the grace of a hairy asshole; Fish will be amongst 9 poets  going to compete for a spot the LouderARTS Project Team 2004.  Talk about feeling surreal. Damn, First thing is first.......  All of you that e-mailed me during the day and wished me luck - thank you  from the bottom of my heart. The one's that called me right before the slam - I  am lovin ya. The love and support is what got me through this slam without  having a nervous breakdown.   Yesterday at 6pm I ate dinner at my mother's house; I threw it up at 6:29. It  tasted much nastier coming up then going down. The nerves, the headache, the  wooziness all kicked in. This made me happy because I know the more nervous I am;  I am remaining humble in my writing and in my place in spoken word.  It was a good night tonight with a sparse crowd bordering on Intimate.  I  tried to maintain some type of cool but I hit the bathroom about three times to  do my own relaxing techniques.   Breathe in......... Breathe out......... Look in the mirror......." you can  do this Fish "  Carlos went and did his " What are words worth" and kicked things off with a  24.8. I hit the second slot and I started my piece. The first three lines were  all a blur. I know I flubbed big time but I gained enough composure to finish  the piece rather confidently. The judges came back with a 25.5. After that,  shit just got fuzzy. R.A.C . Morgan, and George McGibbons went after me and  killed it.  First Round Carlos      24.8 Fish        25.5 RAC     26.0 Morgan   26.6 George      24.8  Second Round Morgan  24.8 (51.4) RAC     25.2 ( 52.7) Fish        25.7 (50.8) Carlos      22.8 (47.6) George      27.9 (52.7)  Third Round George      26.7 -.05 = 26.2 ( 78.9 ) RAC     25.2 (77.9) Morgan  22.0 ( 73.4) Fish        25.5 ( 76.5) Carlos      22.8 (70.4 )   Fourth Round George      24.2 ( 103.1 ) RAC     25.9 ( 103.8 ) Fish        25.5 ( 102.0 ) Morgan  23.3 ( 96.7 ) Carlos      25.1 ( 95.5 )  Standings  RAC     103.8 GEORGE  103.1 FISH        102.0  And just like that , I move into Finals. It was a great slam and being with  what many consider the best, makes me humbled very very quickly. RAC and George  are by far the best people I have ever slammed against. RAC is so non-chalant  and is the typical definition of Cool! George writes in a way that people should hope they can.   One of the Judges were being undoubtedly extra harsh. Tyemba Jess was one of the judges and that motherfucker had no problem giving a .1 or a .5 to certain poets. I am not shittin you. He gave out 00.5 's and 00.1's. I figure that he kept it real as real can get.  I am glad I wasn't on the receiving end of a score that would make you question your writing.  I know some poets talk shit about judges not knowing what real poetry is when they get a low score. Here goes  " Mr Academia" giving out these low scores and you can't argue that he doesn't know his shit. I was ok with how he scored me.... I think the lowest he gave me was a 7.6 or something like that.  I feel good and I know I have great work ahead of me. For those three seconds  in which I knew I was moving into finals- it is great. Then comes the weeks  and weeks of edits and performance tips. I look forward to it.  Let me run and try to sleep  Peace  Oh, seriously, Thank all of you that have supported me and showed me love.  May 10th is Finals. I am getting the Bronx to COME DOWN!!! LOL  Fish

      Sometimes TV is worse then a punch to the face- you could be knocked out or not even phased at all.  Sopranos is sucking major ass this season.  Anyway..... I am good. Good day yesterday as I took most of my day practicing and relaxing.  The weather is going to be crazy today. I was about three seconds from staying home but I am saving all my days for the second half of the year.  I am definitely sneaking out today. This weather got me all happy and shit.  I finally got to write one of my boys on lockdown. I have been trying to get his addy for about 3 years. I finally got that shit on Saturday. I am probably the only kat who writes to the incarcerated brothas I know. Most of my peeps don't believe in picking up a pen and licking a stamp. If I ever get locked up, I will never expect a letter them. I would barely expect a letter from these poet motherfuckers.     We should start an excercise on how to write a letter to people who are locked up.    Step 1  Always start the letter:  " Hello My Brother, I hope when this letter passes through the many strange hands to reach you; You and your family are in the best of health under the guidance of God."  Step 2  Write the body of the text and include postive messages. Don't write about the great time you are having in the clubs and the girls you are having sex with. Downplay everything and make sure you emphasize how much things are not the same out here.  Step 3  Make sure you note you are not willing to do any favors, ie; sending money, sending drugs, visiting, taking collect calls, buying clothes, taking care of his kids.  Step 4  Close the letter like this  " Keep ya head up and be strong, stay out of trouble  After that, you should be ok. Send the letter and expect a letter from them in return still askin for shit.    Oh well  Let me bounce  I am SLAMMIN TONIGHT!!!!!!  4 rounds of shoot em poetry  Fish

      Tick tock...tick tock........tick.......tock........tick...........tock. Slowly, you are going to see the end of spoken word poetry if bullshit keeps getting 9.9 in slams judged by swedish tourist that laugh at inane lines. This is how I felt when I went to the Nuyo Friday and was totally dissappointed in what I heard. Sometimes I wonder when are people going to pick up a poetry book and realize what poetry should be. Then again, performance poetry is completely different right ? Well, if anyone wants to perform a poem and give it life with yells, rants, and bullshit lines; your poetry will leave a mark like Tony Deplastico.  Do you remember Tony DePlastico???? Go Ahead and say  ìNoî ñ that is the point I am trying to make.    This Kat August won the slam and is headed to the Grand Slam on May 7th. I hope to see good ol fashioned well crafted and edited work.   What was cool was my Break Poet slot. I had an opportunity to practice my new memorized poem and it went over well. I made about 1 visible mistake but about 4 the crowd was not aware. Shit- I just started memorizing it this week. Give a brotha credit.   The open room was cool with Rich hosting a choc full room of 5 people on the open mic list. There was some cool first timers which made me miss that humble attitude that most of us had when we first started. I ws thinking about the open room and it should have been packed. Maybe one day we should just make flyers and give people crazy incentive to come out. I think Julio would die if we had an open mic list of 20 people reading and we would finish at 5am.   We should pick a date and get all the Acentos folks out there. Maybe bribe them with free libation or something. :)~  Yesterday morning was an interesting trek. Yes, you read that right. YESTERDAY MORNING. I hit the ìrespect the micî shindig thrown together by ordinary Joe. I have some serious love for that kat because he is working hard at his series.  Then he is humble and mad low key. We threw around some ideas and he is on the right track. Bob was happy with ìrespect the micî repped pretty heavy with ì Acentos ì.   The open mic was ok and I did my thing. It was too early for me to be out there. There was a moment where I was half asleep and I had to walk back and forth to stay awake.  M.C ës had his first official feature yesterday and he rocked out. Nothing beats that first time when you feature. You will remember every aspect of your feature; Friends, nerves, poems, lights, the love. He really did his thing and I canít say nothing but good things. He gave us his everything with New Poems, old poems, and experimental work. Matt is going to work his way to being one of the premiere poets in NYC in the future.  His page work has to be one of the strongest on the scene. We all hung out afterwards and I had a great time. We headed a little cafe; Odessa; and we ate like fools. I ate a burger well done and that shit went through me faster then a warm drink of water. Mental note: Never eat there again.  After some great conversation about movies, poetry, Diane admitting she was Bi, we headed out and called it a daytime day. I dropped Rich and Ray off in Dominican land ( inwood ) and it was fuckin hell. Thousands of dominicans plugging and campaigning for the Domincan president searching re-election. purple flags and  cars honking crazy. It took me way toooo long to leave.  After coming home and grabbing the best nap I ever had; Eric came to my house and we headed down to ìforbidden Cityî. It is a little Bar on 14 street to Bid Helen yum farewell to her move to Hawaii. Yep, fuckin Hawaii.  It was a good day yesterday. I spent a good time with these poet folks and it was cool. I spent the night with eric until 5am this morning and that shit is a mission in itself.  Yesterday was one of those days that made me appreciate these poets more then the usual. I never hang out with them as much as  I should but I know there is a love I canít describe.    I got this letter from a poet yesterday wishing me luck in my upcoming semi. I get letter and e-mails on a regular basis. Something that comes from the heart and is as sincere as that poet himself makes me all tingly inside.     "  Fish, I may be able to get to 13 for the early segment of the evening, but I have a longstanding concert ticket that will ensure I miss your slam.  I wanted to take a moment to say good luck and represent way in advance.  you are my biggest single inspiration to slam - i think you said, "why not?" which is my favorite impetus to do just about anything.  it has been a joy to watch you grow as a performer and an artist and i'm looking forward to the slam judges having enough sense to see how wonderfully you wear the face of poetry."       My life is good.  Peace  Fish

Why?? If Guy wants to, the reason has to be good. " Quentin, call me "  -	Poetry is nothing but what that person thinks it is. There is no across the board definition of what Poetry is.  -	Saw Lenny two days in a row; Only times I have smiled have been from 8:30am - 9:00am  -	My hair is long.  -	I haven't jerked off in three days; I have no sexual desires at all  -	I miss being 20  -	I miss my three fingers  -	in 1992, 2,245 people were killed in NYC. That was a good year for me. I was happy  I'm out  Fish

      It's one of those days where I am happy to be......... me! Last night was a goooood night. I hung out with my Man Eric and we shot some pool. It felt so good to play pool at that level. Running out games and making shots that would make the seasoned pro go " wow ". The first 9 games were serious and teetered between "competitive" and " Hustling ". If you know anything about pool, you know what I am talking about.   After some heart to heart emotional bonding, the cappucino's were ordered. That slick motherfucker made mine with a double shot of expresso without telling me.  I wanted "brown red bull" with ice so I chilled it. That shit hit me immediately! I was wired son. Eric is laughing at me and convinced me to get another one. Mind ya, I wasn't aware it was a double. I get another double and I chill it and I down it.  One cappucino gets me wired to the point where I can't sleep. Imagine two doubles! Oh fuck. I came home and I couldn't even write, watch TV, think, watch my Fish, Turtle, Porn. NOTHING! A piece of me was wondering what is inside of the turtle. Then I was like..... nah.... " If I open it, he would die"  Last night we laughed over the stupidest things in the world. We joked on " Lumidee" ( that chic with the Oh- oh song during the summer). She is the definition of a one hit wonder and we gigged on her all night. Driving through Manhattan we would drive by Bars and look at the people standing outside. For some reason, when we were stopped at a red light, I looked to my right and saw a group of about 12 - 15 people. I opened the window and at the top of my lungs:  " REPENT SINNERS AND CLEANSE YOURSELF OF THE DEVILS LIBATION!"  Holy shit, I laughed so hard! Them folk jumped out of their shirts. They looked at me with my afro looking crazy and they were like...... oh shit.  Eric took off and laughed to the point that our sides were hurting.   Another highlight of the night was when we were driving in Queens and Eric burped. It smelled like a garlic field was growing in his mouth. He took over the car and I was like " What THE FUCK"!!. I started fanning that shit away and stuck my head out the window. How can somebody burp and have it smell like geriatric old ass?  wow  I love my man Eric. No talk of  Poetry, drama, bullshit, issues, beef. We just joked and all the cares in the world were back at home. After he dropped me off, I was still wired but I could still appreciate the tight friendship we have. Let me rephrase that, the tight brotherhood we have.   IN the pre-poetry clique, the runners were Eric, Oscar, Tom, Mike, Jose, Jay,Me, Keith and a few others that don't really make the cut. The biggest heart was always Eric in my eyes. Jose comes a close second. Eric is the one that has always had the most real advice and loving eyes that say " Dude, everything is going to be cool ".  That little dude has been there for me at the lowest parts in my life and there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. I won't question whatever he needs and I will just do it.    Shit, He saved my ex's life when he came to pick me up at 3am.  Yea, It was bad.   It's good to have a friend, a brother, and a mentor  Peace  Fish

      When I gets to typing, I never really know what's going to come out. I tend to just think of something and flow. Usually, my blog gives you somewhat of an insight from the day before. So, not to break tradition - this is what happened yesterday.  Anybody can tell you that has run a poetry series, it's a job that is rarely appreciated with little reward. It is hard as hell. The energy you have to put into it could never be paid back in any form; monetary, sexual, kudos or whatever.  Sometimes you wake up the morning of your series and wonder why it is worth it.  Well, when you have a bar with 60 people wanting to hear poetry and nothing more, it makes it special. When you have smiles plastered across every face when you hear that one line that connected with the whole crowd. An open mic with 20 people who are mixed with new voices and old. When even the regulars are gracious enough to sit back and let the new voices shine in their spot, this make Acentos the best thing in many people's lives.  Yesterday I was driving home and I was genuinely happy. It was probably the first show since day one where nothing needed tweaking, change, suggestions , etc.   Everything is thrown to the side on that date and we head towards perfection.  I don't even know if I should dare say this. Seems that what we are doing at Acentos is seeping over to bar 13. People are coming back to Bar 13 and seeing sort of the same atmosphere we are harnessing at Acentos. A place where we are not afraid to joke. A place where we unbutton our top button from a long work day shirt. A place where we engage the crowd with a loving hug from the stage to the door.  Could it be that Acentos is affecting ( or Infecting ) others?? I don't know. I do know that people love Acentos and the love they have for the art. That love follows us; and the crowd follows that love.  Last night I saw Rich sitting in a corner and that seemed weird to me. He was doing the same thing I do when I go home. He just reflects at the moment. I do it when I am alone and driving home. Rich ,Oscar, Jess, and I will always have love for the art. We will always have love for Acentos. Regardless of what happens to make the unbearable justified, we will always have love for each other.   A good night. A good Night  Now folks, Don't even get it twisted. The next Acentos is going to be fuckin big. We have our first ladies of Acentos ( Acentas ) reppin the latinahood!!!! I am soo excited to have this show at Acentos.   Peace  P.S There were two people that I sorely missed last night and I hope you will both make it to the next installment of Latinoness.  Lenny, I hope you will come support your sisters.  Guy, where da fuck were you last night ?  Fish

      ....... is gonna bit ya on the ass. Well, the first semi's came and went and Celena Glenn is a fuckin  powerhouse.  I can't get over her sly delivery - she has this style that I could barely explain.   Last night  was a good night. It was one of the better nights actually. The lull at 13 has been really upsetting but we are riding the energetic wave from the anniversary show.  At least I hope so. Last night proved just that as I counted 79 people when I handed the door off to Lynne. Well, 79 people is better then 29 a few weeks ago.   It was a good open mic with some of the Louder teamsters delivering new work in honor of National Poetry Month.  I was the sorbet poet so I read within the Slam. My work wasn't brand new but it was only read once before for a slam. The new edits went over well as I tried to read the piece from a narrative perspective.  Onward to the slam....  Oh God....... Why........oh why....!!!!!! ??????  Last night was Jive Poetic, Abena Koomson, Diane Roy ( TP ) Bonafide Rojas, Celena Glenn. I was paying more attention to this slam as next week I will partake in the festivities and hopefuly hold my on against 4 other motherfuckers that have nats experience. How did I get myself into this ?? I have no clue.  Anyway......  Round 1  Jive poetic comes out with a new piece that I never heard before but it wasn't really crafty. It was more of a straight-up delivery with little imagery. In going first - that is hard enough as it is. After he was scored by our scorekeeper Seve -   Jive poetic	26.3 Abena		27.5 Diane		27.0 *( -.5 ) = 26.5 Bonafide	28.4 Celena		28.1  Round 2  After the hoopla was getting heavy- Eric was blowing through the slam. Several judges repping the BX, the B.K, Russia and Mexico AND IT WAS INTERESTING..  It was to early to tell but Round 2 can make or break. From the highest score to the lowest was the order at hand  Bonafide	26.6			(55.0) Celena		28.5			(56.6) Abena		27.6			(55.1) Diane		27.6 *(-.5 ) = 27.1	(53.6) Jive		27.1			(53.4)  Round 3  So Diane got a time penalty two times so far. I doubt she would get a third but who knows with these slams what could happen. Round three comes and we have more of Celena Glenn Coming up.  Celena		28.9			(85.5) Abena		26.8			(81.9) Diane		26.4 *(-.5)=25.9		(79.5) Jive		26.4			(79.8) Bonafide	27.4			(82.4)       Sorbet Round: Some fat Puerto Rican fuck goes and reads a poem- he sucked.  Oh wait, I was the one that read. I am still a fat Puerto Rican fuck! Good piece, very personal.   Round 4  Holy shit!! Three time penalties in a row!! What the fuck?! She got a time penalty last year that cost her semi's. Then, she tries to sing some shit at the start and finish of a poem. Who the fuck siad you had to sing?? IT"S POETRY CARAJO!!!!  Now, I could cop that plea since I am new to this whole thing. What the fuck is her excuse??? I am sorry.... Let me see........ NO EXCUSE!! From now on..... Anything you practive at home has to be under 2:50. You say it was??? Well, you are a special case now. Anything you PRACTICE HAS TO BE UNDER 2;30! Brevity is now your forte!!  Anyway, Round 4 comes and the A.D.D starts to kick in as I can see who will make the finals.  Celena 		26.6		(112.1) Bonafide	28.8		(111.2) Abena		26.9		(108.8) Jive		27.4		(107.2) Diane		28.0		(107.5)  After the usual " the best poets always lose " bit - we bid farewell to two poets. Diane "Time Penalty" Roy is kicked to the curb. Jive poetic is also given walking papers.  What kills me is this  " If Diane would have stood under time - she would have garnered a 109 straight. That would have been enough to get her into the finals. So, for flirting with the time penalty three times in a row - you get the jack ass poet award in my blog. Please feel free to pick up your donkey kick at your convenience"  Good night and I am off to practice and make sure I hold my own next week.  It is going to be hard and my nerves are stacked on top of each other.   Time will tell.  Fish

      I don't really sit down and think about life as much as I used to. I tend to do that when nothing is going on. I had time to reflect on " nothing" that was going on.  When your life has that void, you use the excuse of " reflection" to compensate that emptiness.    I have caught myself giving a laundry list of things that I have done with people I haven't seen in a while. I found it somewhat pompous and overwhelming at some points. Most of my people's  that I grew up with are straight from the ghetto and haven't had a positive thing in who knows how long.  When I meet up with them and speak about Rikers, Fortune, shows, workshops, Acentos, Louder, Readings, Poems, Books...... I catch them shutting down after about 5 mins.  I usually get the  " Damn Fish, That shit is good. You doing your thing ". After that , I just ask " What's the deal with you dawgs?" and I let them speak about their life and what is going on. Don't get it twisted, It is great writing material. I am debating on writing a poem for the dead kats around my way.  Something to give them a voice after they have passed. The question is, where can I start with so many people that have passed away.?  In thinking about my life and what I have been through. I have always compared myself to Janet Brady. That middle child in the middle of everything. I have felt this everyday I wake. I am in the middle between the working class corporate schmucks and the Ghetto slum lowlives. I could easily transform and be accepted into either society. I have never felt smart enough to get over this hump into the intellectual academia forums.  I lost my ghetto credibility when I stepped back fully about 18 months ago.  It was no more " call Fish, he'll take care of it". Now you hear names of people with no clue of how to handle things properly and discreetly.  It's sad.    Lift your wants between the grains of dirt.  memories stain my tongue With tears, cry back to us   Good Start -   Peace  Fish

      It's all about the hustle son. Not what  you know but who you can intimidate.   This has always been the rule. You can be a nice guy but make sure that whoever you grace knows you have no qualms putting a bullet in their face.  This doesn't quite apply to the poetry world but in the ghetto; it reigns supreme.  Even though my career as .........well....... a very convincing person is over, I relished in some of the things I did. From bouncing to just being back end muscle, it was all good.  The gool ol days  Now, I have Fish, turtles, and poetry  LOL  Fish

      My Fish tanks are rockin. I have  4 Oscars ( 2 tigers, 2 red ), 2 tinfoils, 2 Columbian Sharks ( Cat Fish ). I have totally jumped back into a hobby that found a back seat to poetry.  Today, I jumped into another field of nature. I brought me a ed eared slider turtle and named him Pablo Elliot Neruda ( P.E.N ). The turtle is kick-ass. I throw in a feeder fish and Pablo does not waste two seconds in eating his dinner.  I have him in a ten gallon tank but next week I am picking up a 30 gallon to give him the room he needs. I am really loving this little dude.   I am good.  Let me get back to editing some poems too. I am slamming the 19th. Ugh  Peace  Fish

      ....they beat the shit out of Jesus. It is no longer the day our savior sacrificed his life for us. They beat the shit out of him until he finally said " Fuck this, I am dying "  Thank you Mel Gibson for skewing the views of anyone who sees your movie. Also, your violent ass came off with about 300 million profit from your movie.  I wonder what your next movie is??  The final 3 minutes of JFK's life from the view of the bullets that went into his head? Maybe the story of the electrical currents that went into Ted Buny's body. How about the cotton that was shoved up his ass to avoid him from shittin all over the place.   " The Ted Bundy story: Told from the cotton used to catch his shit"  Weird  I am back and I am not dead. Long day yesterday that ran into today   You all be good  Peace, Love, Porkchops.

      Yesterday was one of those proactive and constructive days that make you happy you are alive. After much back and forth debate; my ass hit Barnes and Noble to support, stalk and show love to Willie Perdomo. One of the poets that I am still in awe from. Seeing Willie doing his thing was hot. I think Rich got to him when he featured for Acentos because he read new work from his upcoming manuscript, "Emergency Money". The poetry mainly came from his new book, Smoking lovely. The crowd was decent and the Q & A after wards was hot.   The highlight came when a young latina woman asked about Cave Canaam accepting latin folks. Willie answered graciously and she asked again where can she find support for Latino Writers.      Wille says: "There is an awesome groups of brothers and sisters up in the Bronx called Acentos and they have been great. They are really doing their thing and they harness mostly everything latino. They have been the best I have seen for Latino poetry. They are also a part of the louderARTS Project and they run workshops and such. Fish is a part of them and is right there in the back and he can answer any questions for you"  After I wiped the cum stain off my pants, I couldn't hold on the the flyers fast enough. Talk about a great opportunity to let those white folk in Manhattan know there is something in the Bronx Willie Perdomo Respects and loves.  Can you say " Wow "?  After some networking and such, I was debating on heading to Carlitos or the Bowery to support brother Shawn Randall. A flip of the mental quarter and I hit the Bowery. I was kinda scared because when Shawn was doing West side  Rhyme; I did not like that venue nor format.  Something about it screamed " yuck". I haven't heard anything about it but I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.   I got there and copped a seat in the back. As some of the poetry came from people I have heard before, I was more amazed with their performance and the welcoming and embracing atmosphere. Mara went up there and killed it. My upcoming slam nemisis ( George McKibbons )went up there and just made me wonder how the fuck I am going to top him in the upcoming slam on April 19.   What I never liked about some venues ( including Louder ) is the mix of Musicians and Poetry. It has to be something really spectacular in order for me to gush over it.  Yesterday was perfect when it came down to a mix that is not my favorite. It wasn't too much but just enough. Only one dude was depressing as fuck but to each their own.   I have to really applaud Shawn on a great show and a good atmosphere. He was a nervous wreck at the very start but he held his own.  He spoke respectfully to the crowd and the banter was held to a minumum. The show was just about that, the show. His little skit about reading from a teleprompter was the small knack of humor the night needed and it created a consistancy of the night without a lull that made my A.D.D kick in.  If you haven't checked out Symphonics, I would highly suggest to do so. His 50 or so patrons are a testemant to his hard work and dedication to this show. Shit, he even had a program of the night with all the bios of all the performers. That theater experience is a bitch. Kudos  After some great conversation with Guy, Roger, Bob, Marty, mara, Eric (g)....... my ass had to head home because Fish was not staying at a bar until who knows when.    Another interesting tidbit is a magazine that Guy put me on too. I never have been into Vibe and XXL and all those other magazines that want to " keep it real ". I just put my ear to the ground in the Bronx and follow the gunshots and get all the news I need from the face looking into the sky blankly lying in his blood and garbage. This magazine, Don Diva, is pretty harsh. All the shit you don't want cops to know is splattered across color pages of half naked video rump shakin hoochies. Drug dealing tips as to where to stash your shit. Personally, I don't find that too cool. The streets are like a cosa nostra that not many should speak about. Here and there you will have a knucklehead say something but not in a national magazine.   Times a changing.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      Gratuitously borrowed from Guy via Tony Brown  1. Grab the nearest book. 2. Open the book to page 23. 3. Find the fifth sentence. 4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.     -" I have so little, my son " he said suddenly the loving patriarch. ("The Read tent " Anita Diamant)  - * "Falls in it's own time, in its own rhyme, yellow leaf" ( Except by Falling by Sean Thomas Dougherty)  * The fifth sentence( Line ) just had the word " leaf ", I also added what preceded the 5th sentence.

      Sometimes I check my e-mail and it's nothing more then robotic.   - Sign on AOL - Check e-mail - no reaction - sign off  Once in a blue moon I get an e-mail that makes me soo happy. I never know where to expect the e-mails to originate from but I do know when I get them - I am good.  When I first started this poetry debacle that is quickly transforming into a passion, there was a venue in Brooklyn called " Morgies". It was the brainchild of Roger and Lynne. I am still pissed they let it go to the land of shit but that is their issue and not mine. Not the point.  We used to trek it to the deepest bowels of Brooklyn to read poetry and I was really loving that spot. They had a cappucino that made sex a distant second in my book. Roger also managed to bring down some of the most awesome poets on the scene.  One day while attempting to write and perform poetry ( the battle still continues till this day ), I made a fool out of myself by choking in the first three lines of my poem. Mind you, this was in front of Willie Perdomo. After that, I worked a little harder and read off the page.  I read this poem called "fear", and it dealt mainly with death, my lack of fear in anything, and  " if you fuck with me I have no problems killing you ". I read that poem and got my polite and controlled applause and walked off stage. That evening  urlLink Bassey , Shane Koyscan and Kevin Coval were in attendance. I had no clue who they were but in the poetry community, they are what many consider heavy weights.  At the end of the evening, we are all taking pictures with a digital camera and we are posing like fools. Bassey jumps in one picture and I proceed to hug her, flip her upside down and hold her by her ankles and we take a picture like that .      I just met her that day and it was hard for her to warm up to me after that. She goes up to Kevin Coval and tells him......  Bassey: " You let him do that to me, aren't you going to do anything?" Kevin: " Didn't you hear the poem that guy just read?"  It was one of those moments that you really can't forget. Bassey was one of the first people who has witnessed me making a fool out of myself on the mic.  She saw me read this past Saturday at Louder then words and this is what I get :   [hey.you]   just wanted to tell you how absolutely wonderful your poem was on Saturday. I hope to God, this doesnít sound condescending, but Iím so happy to hear how much Your work and your performance has grown since the first time I saw you. I think you Are absolutely brilliant and I look forward to hearing more of your work in the future. Love to love ya, B.       ahhhhh... the lovely young Bassey made my month. When you are reading on the scene you tend to stagnate amongst the peers who hear your work frequently.  So this e-mail coming from her ( being a heavyweight and all ) gives me good reason to feel...... well........ good.  Thanks girl   Gotta work..  Peace, Love, Porkchop  Fishdawg

      I am happy. 120 some odd people were at 13 last night to celebrate the pompous poets anniversary shindig. I say pompous because we HAVE THAT RIGHT CARAJO!  It was good to get there at 7pm and see almost the whole Louder crew there ready and willing to be constructive in their participation. Shit, Jayme and Ginna took my job of the door and I was happy to mingle out and about amongst the crowd.   The night was full of Thank you's , love, appreciation, plugs and... uh..... oh yea... " Poetry ". With a short open mic with Eliel, John, Bizzart, and suzy Folliette it was solid and good to see new voices interspersed with old. I know, I am forgetting some but those are the one's I put a mental block on intentionally to forget them ( ie; Big mike )   The show itself was a nice concept as M.C had the emotional hammer of the evening and gave the best speech as to what louder stands for.  Not many people understand. You can not come to louder ( bar 13 ) with a typical poem ranting and raving and think you deserve genius accolades. You better sit and edit your pieces and ensure craft is first and foremost on your list. Some slackers in the community think this mindset is elitist and exclusive. Well, if you want to write bullshit and be close minded as to the advice of others on your work;  I guess we are pompous. We are pompous, egotistical elitist asshole poets with the best poetry on this side of the east coast.   Rives has issues. Ahhhhhh..........Rives the white boy poet who must have heard I was a nice guy as he made some comments to me that usually would have gotten the layman poet/patron smacked. It was all taken in good gest and I was actually really impressed.  Most of the people I respect on the scene I take their love of certain poets seriously.  Taylor went on the stage and gushed over rives as one of the best poets on the scene. So, I naturally sat there and listened to everything that came out of his mouth.  The best??? Nahhhh.....but he is certainly different and you can tell that is what puts him on a pedestal all his own.    Nice night  Peace

      - Friday was interesting as a student of mine at Rikers tried to Act up.  He didn't want to write, read, participate. Fine, then stay there and enjoy what you hear. He insisted on talking shit and disrupting my class. He confronted me and I told him to see me after he gets out. I threw him out of my class. Fuck him.  - The bus took 55 mins to come to get me off that fuckin island. I went home pissed, aggravated but somewhat accomplished with a very successful class.    - Saturday saw me getting some more materials for my Fish tank project. I am getting back into my fish and I forgot how much fun it is.  I got a phonecall from Eric inviting me to a birthday dinner. I was like " Who's birthday is it?", he says... "mine". I forgot Eric's Birthday. I am such a piece of shit. So now the guilt is coming on strong and I had to go meet up with him for dinner.  The whole fam was there and I had one of the greatest times in a long time.  - preceding the dinner was my showcased reading at Louder Then words. I can say shit about the show since I had to leave immediately after my reading. I went to go meet up with Eric and the fam so instead of moving my car from a good parking, I took a cab up. I made a mistake soo.........  - I got a $115 dollar parking ticket. I am fighting that shit.  - Sunday saw me searching for two Colombian Sharks ( CaTfish ) for my FishTank. I found them on my old block in a hot little pet shop.  I put them in and it was so cool seeing them in my tank with my other Fish.  Saw the soprano's last night and this was a fuckin novela. I am not so happy with this season.  - I would write about my sexual tryst last night but I am not at liberty to talk about my personal sex life - regardless of how much I paid for her or not.  - Louder Monday anniversary show tonight. It's gonna be big. ( At least I hope so )  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      How and when do you learn to love poetry is beyond me.  Yesterday I went to support Ray at the Jersey ART house in jersey City. I got there in time to see some open mic folk and was eagerly waiting for Ray to assist Rick Pernod. Man, the script was flipped as Ray put it and all the open mic'ers were put on before Ray and Rick. I wanted to stay but my dawg Eric doesn't feel Poetry and the look on his face was painful. Not the hernia operation he just went through, just the amount of poetry that he considered dismal. So an early exit and a hug for Ray to show taht I came out to show him love and off Eric and I went.  It was a good day to hang with Eric as I wanted to get some lovely things off my chest. Then I realized what I was getting off my chest was petty and not worth venting over.  If he is not wasting his breathe, I tend to know it's all bullshit.  I am the first one saying that I am not trying to deal with bullshit but here spoon feeding it by great loads.  Some things in my life are pretty cut and dry. Black and white, good or bad. There are not many shades of gray when I walk my walk.  Do I consider myself a self righteous zealot with no consideration for others who choose to destroy their lives???  Well, yea.   I grew up in a neighborhood with a mentality that bullshit has zero tolerance in our book.  I have smacked dudes for just saying something stupid and delving into territory where they deserved what they got. ie " yo fish, why does your mother have an orange afro"? One look, one smack " don't ever talk about my mother"  Get my drift?  well, I have had some differences with people and it does get tiring sometimes.  The differences range from personal to business from my job to the workshops we facilitate. I have never labeled myself a controlling czar. I try to maintain an open mind as to what is best for whatever I/we do.  I do know that if anyone approaches me with bullshit that I am going to give them bullshit back.    After some unfortunate circumstances and situations- time has to come to work on some things. This reactionary brother is not running thought. I am taking my time to make sure whatever I do is the right decision.  Until then  life is good.  Fish

      YOu ever had a moment in your life when you thought you had your finger in almost everything; then you are smacked in the face with som much new info that you are overwhelmed?  This is the feeling I had yesterday with my first meeting at the BCA ( Bronx Council on the Arts ). Firstly, I went to the wrong location as I thought the Bronx writers center was the BCA. Another 5 minute drive and I made it where I was supposed to be in the first place.   The brunt of the meeting were different events going on in the Bronx. Where everyone stands and who's finger is in what. I was naturally stand offish since Acentos is pretty much self contained amongst it's organizers.  Coming soon we will have an event at Acentos to raise funds for a new up-start organization.  A piece of me still wonders why they want us to help them. Then again, a piece of me sees Acentos reeping major benefits down the road from this endeavor. Either workshops, teaching gigs, feature work etc.. it all will pay off in the long run.  When I met with the guys at Acentos we agreed to concentrate on making contact with community based organizations. We went one step further and put the finger into something that is taking baby steps. In assisting them with whatever we can do, it makes my heart flutter. Unfortunately, the lady running it has her head several inches up her ass but she is a nice lady.  Dealing with Casiano, Aguado and several other folks makes me wonder how these folks do business. They are a rather " jovial" bunch in their own merry devils nectar ingesting type of way.   So far it seems that we have a date nailed down and the 13th will be kinda big. It will be hot but it will be big.   Sometime next week we have a full story coming out in the Bronx Beat which is a Columbia Based journalism  periodical that concentrates on Bronx events. She was at the anniversary show and she has gushed over what she saw since that day.   I started reading " the Red tent" authored by Anita Diamant and the first chapters have managed to keep me interested. I am not too much into fiction ( historical or otherwise ) but the book seems promising. The book is also closely related to biblical aspects and you all know I can't stand religion. Yet, diamant has some greatly placed poetic devices in this book that makes me say " wow".  " words flowed out of her mouth like water onto sand "  With lines like that, she better keep it up before I give the book back to Maria with several pages ripped out.  Let me bounce, I got way to intellectual today  ewww  YUCK  BLAUGH!!!  FISH

      This is what I get for writing on blogger instead of microsoft word.     As I was saying before my post was lost - I was doing some things yesterday and it took alot out of me. I got home and layed on the couch and I slept heavily. Of course being on the couch until 3am is one of my more common mistakes. I should learn by now that sleeping on the couch will rob me of any and all energy for the next day.  I managed to peel this fatness off the couch to wash my face. After coming back; I was visually kidnapped by the TV-HBO to Be exact. They were giving "Natural born Killers" at 3am. How much do I love this movie??? Enough to stay awake and lose some serious sleep.  When this movie came out in 1994, I was amazed. At first, I was completely awestruck over the killings and murders on the big screen.  Not many movies delved into violence but this movie jumped head first. As I got older I started dissecting this movie more and more. The symbolism and message was far deeper then two serial killers catching wreck across the United States. Every killing, every camera angle, every line was a segue to a deeper meaning.   The media was perpetrated as the whore's for ratings they are. The killings were glorified in the media as we have seen even in real life. IF Nick Berg was just found dead; would he have gotten that much media frenzy.  Something about this flick always touched me and even back then I knew I despised the media. Seems as if nothing has changed in the 10 years since the release of this film. I hated the media back then; I hate them more now. Ironic is how I have become an avid reader of the times, daily news, post, and varied news sites.  I have always loved hearing about news but as time moved on, you see how full of shit they are. Then the fuckin Big Machine manipulates the media like fuckin chess pawns. All of this from a movie.   Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      Dear Fish:  I know the counselor said we shouldn't contact each other during our "cooling off" period, but I couldn't wait anymore. The day you left, I swore I'd never talk to you again. But that was just the wounded little girl in me talking. Still, I never wanted to be the first one to make contact.  In my fantasies, it was always you who would come crawling back to me. I guess my pride needed that. But now I see that my pride's cost me a lot of things. I'm tired of pretending I don't miss you. I don't care about looking bad anymore. I don't care who makes the first move as long as one of us does. Maybe it's time we let our hearts speak as loudly as our hurt. And this is what my heart says...  "There's no one like you, fish." I look for you in the eyes and crotches of every man I see, but they're not you. They're not even close. Two weeks ago, I met this guy at midtown Bar and brought him home with me. I don't say this to hurt you, but just to illustrate the depth of my desperation. He was young, maybe 22, with one of those perfect bodies that only youth and maybe a childhood spent weightlifting can give you. I mean, just a perfect body. A perfect ass you wouldn't believe. Every woman's dream, right? But as I sat on the couch blowing  this hunk, I thought, look at the stuff we've made important in our lives. It's all so superficial. What does a perfect body mean?  Does it make him better in bed? Well, in this case, yes. But you see what I'm getting at. Does it make him a better person? Does he have a better heart than my moderately attractive fish? I doubt it. And I'd never really thought of that before. I Don't know, maybe I'm just growing up a little.  Later, after he tossed me about a half a pint of throat yogurt, I found myself thinking, "Why do I feel so drained and empty?" It wasn't just his flawless technique or his slutty, shameless hunger, but something else. Some feeling of loss. Why did it feel so incomplete? And then it hit me.  It didn't feel the same because you weren't there, Fish, to watch. Do you know what I mean? Nothing feels the same without you. Jesus, Fish, I'm just going crazy without you. And everything I do just reminds me of you.  Do you remember Freddy, that single dude we met at the Nuyorican? Well, he dropped by last week with a pan of lasagna. He said he figured I wasn't eating right without a man around. I didn't know what he meant till later, but that's not the real story. Anyway, we had a few glasses of wine and the next thing you know we're banging away in my bedroom. And this guy's a total monster in the sack. He's giving me everything, you know like a real man does when he's not hung up about his career and whether the kids can hear us. And all of a sudden he spots that tilting mirror on your grandmother's old vanity. So he puts it on the floor and we straddle it, right, so we can watch ourselves. And it's totally hot, but it makes me sad too. 'Cause I can't help thinking, "Why didn't fish ever put the mirror on the floor? We've had this old vanity for what, 8 Months, and we never used it as a sex aid."  Saturday, your friend John drops by with my copy of the restraining order. I mean, John is just a kid and all, but he's got a pretty good head on his shoulders and he's been a real friend to me during this painful time.  He's given me lots of good counsel about you and about men in general. Heís pulling for us to get back together, Fish, he really is. So we're drinking in a hot bath and talking about happier times. Here's this hot dude with the same looks  as you and all I can do is think of how much he looked like you when you were 18. And that just about makes me cry. And then it turns out John's really into the whole anal thing and that gets me to thinking about how many times I pressured you about trying it and how that probably fuelled some of the bitterness between us. It's only a dildo Fish, alot of guys do it.  But do you see how even then, when John is thrusting inside my cinnamon ring, all I can do is think of you? It's true, Fish. In your heart you know it. Don't you think we could start over? Just wipe out all the grievances and start fresh? I think we can.  If you feel the same please, please, please let me know, otherwise, can you let me know where my earrings are ?  Your ex    Disclaimer: This shit was just a joke

      ...... CHULETAS BABY!!!!!!!   Ahhhhh..... that is the best thing in life; porkchops! Yesterday was a good fuckin day! Eric came to pick me up and we headed to meet up with OMX.  After enlisting the services of Eric's SUV to drop off some stuff at the condo, we headed to eat.   Yesterday was a really good day. I haven't hung out with Eric and Oscar alone in a long time. All three of us have gone through some shit in the past couple of months.  It felt good to hang with them and just laugh and act a fool. It has been a very very long time and I felt a serious support system yesterday.   Oscar there for Eric Fish there for Eric Oscar there for Fish Eric there for Fish All three of us about to hug each other and GET NAKED BABY!!!! Heehee. Oscar is not my type; he'll fight back.   I got home and I have been diddling with this poem about the male lineage in my family. It is touchy - probably the deepest I have gotten into me wanting to end my male bloodline.  Alcoholism, womanizing, domestic abuse, even justified death is swirling in the dome.   I should have a good draft by the next Acentos.  Gotta bring the new shit.  Short blog  Peace, Love, Porkchops   Fish

      .......I mean, you always talk about how you'd do anything for certain friends - even help hide the bodies - but I mean, how much respect do you have for someone who could possibly do that to someone and how much respect do you have for the cops that may put someone away?    So maybe it should be about respect.  Yeah, that's it!   By the way, I hope I'm not making any assumptions here, I dont really know much about your life except for what I read on the blogs, but it SEEMS you've changed a little over the years, no?   ************************  There are two great topics to blog about today. I could go the respect route or the " how much has Fish changed route".  I will try to integrate the two as best as possible.  Have I changed over the years?? Yes. As to how much; you will never understand how much. Everyone in life changes from one unique way to the other. In which direction the change takes them-it's on them. I did the typical ghetto shit and suffered the consequences. I will never blame anyone but myself. I fucked up and did stupid shit and I am paying for them. I made seriously bad choices  - Never finished college - Engaged in more violence then the average Iraqi citizen - Justified my actions under the " Friendship" umbrella. - Broken more hearts then I really needed too - Lost the respect of my parents - Managed to get a record; therefore shitting on my chances of ever running for office. - Hated more then loved  The one thing I have always hated is when a black person starts talking shit about being opressed and slavery and all that shit that happened 400 years ago. I barely like thinking about my past which was about 5 years ago. Thing is, I learned from that past.   The worst moment of my life was walking out of Jail to a waiting mother and father; the look on my fathers face broke my heart. He raised a failure. Now, if you know me, you know I have 7 fingers. You would think the worst moment of my life was when I lost them and spent 33 days in the hospital. Kinda strange if you ask me. I never had a chance to think about much after facing 60 years to life for four attempts.  You ever been in a situation where your life could be taken from you??? Not killed in a nice way; locked up? That shit puts your life in perspective.   SO after about 10 years of carrying a gun everyday and finaly getting caught; no more of that shit for me.  I took the gun collection; threw them in a safe; stashed the safe behind some drywall and plaster; haven't looked back since. It's been since April 6, 1998 since I last touched my guns.   I questioned this mentality of being a ghetto thug and keeping that respect in the streets. Was it respect or fear?? I don't know and honestly don't care.  Slowly and methodically... I made my exit from around the way. I didn't hang that much; I stayed away from clubs; I stopped bouncing; I went with Oscar to read at an open mic for he won't have to do it alone.  Story plays itself to the present.  I give respect as I want it returned to me; unconditionally. I have some people in my life that I respect and walk with them to the ends of the earth.  There are some people that have loss my respect and I never gave them a second chance - fuck them. Some people have earned a right to a reconcilliation of sorts. Respect is a dangerous street with me too. If I trust you and put you in a position that you have earned that trust and you fuck it up; I am making your life a shit fest.  I have no qualms smacking you in front of everybody if you fucked up on me. That is ghetto but I am working on that. What I am high on is my business. If you know something about me and you choose to blab it to anyone after common sense tells you not too; you are threading thin water with me. If it comes back to me and I know for a fact that only one person knows that certain thing; refer to previous comment about the smack.   There is a code in the ghetto. You do your job and we do ours. Even though yours is to catch us; we will work as hard as possible not to get caught. 99% of the time a person gets caught is because of greed, poor judgment, stupidity. If you do get caught, pues, they are doing their job son. Call Fred [ neighborhood Lawyer} and hope he can get you off. The best cop to the worst thug will tell you........  " Respect from both sides is what makes this game workable "   Did I answer the question?? I have no clue.  I do have to make believe I am going to work  Peace

      Today was a good day at Acentos. We are going to change the name to " Acentos - Una Relacion de Nu Shit ".  I didn't keep a solid track but the new shit on the mic was heavy tonight.    I haven't been feeling poetry for a couple of days and Acentos was all that I needed. Today was the day that I knew what "keeping it real " meant. Just have some fun and enjoy everything under the umbrella of poetry.   I finished that Bodega Dreams; ugh. I really fucked up readng the Red Tent and then starting Bodega Dreams.  The caliber of writing was ions apart.  The dreams of Willie Bodega were as real as my incredibly sexy body. Get the point?? I wouldn't suggest that book unless you really really have to read it. Fiction or not, it wasn't on the money.  Well...... much need rest calls  Fish

      These are kinda in the middle of a regular blog entry and the shortened Fish Flake style.    Good weekend.......   -	Hung out with the masses this weekend.  I did the family thing on Saturday and chilled with the Parental units most of the day and evening. We all truly overdosed on seafood. My mother has to be the funniest old lady in this world.  When I start joking with her about her belly and how  it's getting bigger -she says " eso es la leche de tu papa ". Loosely translated: " That is your fathers sperm getting me swollen ". My mother is 68 years old; do you think I need to picture my parents fucking?   -	Headed to the old block and chilled with Andy and a few of the new young stragglers who looked at me as if I had 5 heads.  Andy is the brother who was immortalized in my poem; Perdido.  This cat is young and he is a little too experienced for his years.  Street life makes you grow up quick. We were discussing how the young girls around the way have all been getting knocked up.  He says the little girls are growing too quick for their own good. Here is the kicker:  Fish: 33 years old ~~ Little kids are between 18 and 22 ~~~  Andy: 22 years old ~~ Little kids are between 14 and 20 ~~~  When I first moved to Elder; some girls were just born; Jayme, Dorayma, Ally.  ( 1985 etc etc )  There were already girls there who were considered the little girls; Kamalish, Glenda, Maria,  Jessica ( 1980's etc etc )  Then the girls around my age; Yadira, Millie, Milagros, Cindy ( 1972 's etc etc )  When I am on the block and I am seeing the girls I saw in carriages pushing around their own carriages; That shit makes me feel old.  Even better is when I see Jayme at 19 with her daughter who is 5 years old.  That made me see that vicious fuckin cylcle first hand. How can this chic instill morals and values in her daughter??? She barely has any of her own.    I always wondered about me and kids. It has come to a point where I refuse to have them and I can't see myself with them.  The last girl I was with thought I had issues when I said " I don't want kids ".  A great piece of me feels love is needed to create life; refer to previous posts.  -	Eric came to pick me up to do a little more male bonding. My nigga is going through some shit and it's affecting me pretty badly.  I just have to be there for him and try to think as clearly as possible.  It was cool to actually drive around yesterday. We drove around Washington heights and oggled at the half naked domincan women. It's a world of a difference over that little bridge.  -	Coming home I stopped by Jorge Merced place in his celebration of  Oshun*.  I haven't been in that setting for a long time and it felt good to see so many different faces. I was asked the question: Y usted tiene su santecho?" I replied kindly , " no, toda via no lo tengo ". I was offered  a blessing and told " Tu corazon esta claro pero negro para un tiempo muy largo ". Translation; Your heart is clear but it was black for too long.  After some blessing from the padrino; more seafood for me.  I stood there for the ceremonial offerings to the various saints. It was cool to see the horses tail bless the house and the shrine. Santeria isn't the widest understood religion; it is cool though.  -	Got home and jumped in the recliner and put my face in my hands.  I looked up and spoke to God, Allah, Budda, La Orishas, Krishna, Tao, and said thank you.    Regardless of everything going slightly batty, I am good. My life is good.      *Oshun - rules over the water of the world -- rivers, streams, and brooks. She embodies love, beauty, and fertility. She represents the blood flowing through and creating human life. She is also associated with culture and the fine arts. She is the youngest of the Orishas and the messenger to the house of Olorun. Her saint is Our Lady of Charity, Cuba's Patron Saint. Her colors are yellow and gold and her number is 5   _

      JUST GOT HOME FROM PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY OF 2004.  Why do I involve myself in things where my body can't keep up is never suprising. By the grace of your deity; it gets done.  I wasn't at work today and I didn't get my usual blog fix for the day. I woke up at 4am today and I got to make a quick entry to satisfy those stalkers. I was thinking about em and I decided to make a quick stop by their tiny slice of cyber space;  urlLink Big Dy  touched on the surreal today.  It takes a certain type of man to look another in the face and pull the trigger. One who has no care for life nor consequences; who doesn't think twice about throwing a wrench into the lives of everyone connected to that one life just ended. That dude is a bitch compared to one who has no fear of getting hurt from falling in love.  I have been in relationships where I thought I was in love to relationships where I am thinking; " What the fuck, you came three times, GO HOME!".  I can't be the voice of authority when love is involved, I can only give my perspective on it. Thing is, I barely know what it is. I am not going to detail about my lovefests gone awry. I can't explain how many women have fallen in love with me and I have pushed them away farther and faster then the black plague. Why?? I haven't gotten hurt in my life with love. I have gotten surely fucked, stomped, kicked, and dare I say; jaded.   When I thought I was in love and I dedicated 5 loyal years; it boils down to:  " Fish, I just need time to live my life "   Translation: I am currently fucking another guy at my job and the different dick after getting just yours for 5 years seems great.  Conclusion: I found out about the next man 16 hours after we broke up. I cried for about 20 minutes then waited to go to her job the next day.  " Luis " wasn't there but she was.  After " loving " her with every fiber of my being; I didn't make a scene and I walked out after telling her " I gave you my life and you threw it away ". I walk out of her job and see " Luis " brother waiting for his girlfriend that worked at the same place. I walk up to him and told him to give a message to his brother. I grabbed my knife and shoved it in his nose and pulled it out. Was it wrong? yes. Did I care? No.  I called the one person that I knew cared for me as a shoulder to lean on. The next day, we were an item. Did I fall in love??? Itwas the epitomal definiton of rebound. I loved as I was loved. Tic for a tac per se.  $10,000 dollars later, a move to Queens, 4 years of replacement sex, hugs, and affection; I get.........  Lisa: We have to talk Fish: About? Lisa: Come to the bedroom and sit down Fish: Question Lisa: What? Fish: Are you going to give me a break-up speech? Lisa: Why? Fish: If you are; don't bother Lisa: What? Why? Fish: I just gave you mine Lisa: What do you mean? Fish: Well, you want to call it quits  right? Lisa: Yea Fish: Well, I do too Lisa: I am staying in the apartment, I am not leaving Fish: That's ok, I already have an apartment, I am leaving Next Friday  Conclusion: After some serious shit popping off. I did some more of my detective work.  Turns out she was fuckin a guy named " Larry ". I wanted out of this relationship so bad; I didn't care. So larry got away with his nose intact.  I moved back to the Bronx and I promised myself that I was staying alone for one year. From the age of 16 to 27, I was never single.  It was time to find myself spiritually, emotionally, and all those other tidbits of self-finding-power-modes that make us get by.  After Lisa there were three relatonships that have stuck to me. All three have fallen in love with me and I haven't been able to return that love. I could possibly go to the end of the world for them but loving them unconditionally has been difficult. Giving myself 100% and moving forward has scared me to the point where I freeze, stop, shut down.    I know love will stop eluding me eventually. Better yet, I will stop eluding love one day. There has been times where I have known for a fact that my fears have cost me very special partners. Relationships where I know happiness was definitely thrown in for both our future benefits. IF I know I would be happy in the future, why not go for it?? Well, Would it be fair to stay with someone who provides happiness but you can't love them ? Better yet, refuse yoursef to love them? It's just not fair in my eyes.  How do I love? That seems to be the question of the hour. Just to jump in head first seems best to describe it. Just no care for hurt, worries, pain, regrets. Stand by the lakeside of love and know the water is freezing. Take off all your clothes; admire the penis that will definitly shrivel to a raisin when that water hits it; take a deep breathe; close your eyes; JUMP IN!! I can't et past that breathing pase it seems. I know when I do, it will be incredible. I will want to live every waking moment thinking of the love I have at home. The long nights of laughing at everything. making love in the weirdest places. Never having an awkward moment. Living passion bridled with adventure. The notes more important then gold. The dinner more important then intamacy. Sharing health problems and comparing liver spots. Loving love until I have to bury you, until I can't live without you. Not being able to fucntion as a lone unit.   Love is hard  My life is good but when love hits me  Life is better  Peace  P.s Big Dy, thanks

      I don't have a clue how I used to wake up at 4am to get to my job by 5am.  Better yet, I don't know how I used to bounce at a club until 4am and go straight to work! I am getting old.  Fish Flakes  - Played pool; I  suck  - Louder then words tonight; if you miss it- consider yourself an asshole  - Say good bye to Eric  - Oscar won the Brio  - Rich will be home by Tuesday  - Tom is huge  - Strippers no longer turn me on  - I think Great Adventures is this weekend ; niggas better call  - I am not going to work today  Peace

      ....was good to me. My batteries which lost life were energized yesterday.   Got to the Nuyo early as I braved the trains and headed downtown sans the hooptie. I figured why bother going home to pick up the car to drive back down.   Yesterday was the day that I gained more respect for Fred.  He has always been touch and go with me with some of the things I've seen him do. His poetry, bookings, events, personal style ....etc.... etc... etc. I do have to say he was a gracious host and he made me feel very comfortable.  It was shameful the nuyo was empty compared to other crowd standards.  Some of the Acentos borg came down to support and that was nice. The cinnamom Gorilla,  our personal Pablo Escobar and the squishy butt have become some serious staples almost everywhere I pop my head up. It's not bad since seeing their faces makes the little security blanket just a little softer.  The sets were great and I had soooo much fun. I forgot how to have fun. Yea, I admit it, I got lost in the competition of things and stop practicing my preachings.    " Just go up there and have a good time ".   I haven't followed that; it has bitten me on my ass. Yesterday featuring with Bone and Oscar gave me a new memory to look back on. I think we are all fools but we take what we do to heart.  The hat wearing sorta rican rocked this new piece that made me go " wow ". The battlefield re-visited has definitely showed how far Oscar has come. Shit who the fuck am I to judge or give kudos but that kat is doing it.  Bonafide rocked with some new pieces of his book. I agree with someone who said his poetry is far better when he features and not in the slam setting.  I came out with most old pieces and hit two new pieces. Even my newly memorized " perdido " seems kinda old since  I debut it in November. The newest piece was my 1 minute piece that I am really loving. It is quicky becoming a solid mantra of mine.   The crowd was sparse but I loved it. Got some wonderful hugs from the crowd  and we plugged Acentos within an inch of life.  I wanted to Plug louderMONDAY but it didn't fit last night. I don't mind, we did a job, we did it well. As for Bone and Oscar; I love ya niggas. Yesterday was the first time that I felt professional with you two fucks.  We joked, We laughed, we gigged, the show was awesome. For me personally, thank you for giving me reason to continue.  Quick and much love for Lenny coming down and letting me bother her most of the night. When my nerves are getting the better of me, I bother her and I feel better. Thanks   Let me bounce and get upset about Puerto Ricans being under the poverty level amongst all latino's in the United states. We came to the United States and started poor; we are still fucking poor.   Oh, where is the outrage with 40 iraqi's getting smoked by those Helicopter gunships?  Was it an "insurgent" safehouse or a wedding??    Peace

      Tonight I read at the nuyo; there is my plug  I am ok today. I had a good start this morning with a good smile. I didn't have my usual " I want to kill everyone on the train " moment.  You ever thought of the raminfications of taking the D train early in the morning and having some sick fuck walk on with several guns??? The massacre would rival that one of Valentines day 1993 on Prospect.  The D train has a stretch of about 10 mins from 145 th to 59th street. I think if you go to the end of the train car; shoot the first men you see. Everyone will automatically run to the end of opposite side of the train. Then you just pick them off from a distance of 10 feet. No, I am not using a bullshit 22 cal automatic. I am talking about HK-91 fully automatic 308 cal assault rifle. That shit would leave holes in ya!  Dare to dream  I'm not sick, I just get bored.   Get up shit shave shower dress go to work work sleep eat lucnh come home   Thank God I am a poet. At least I get to read and write poetry.    Peace

      THat is how I describe my life sometimes. Everything is much roomier being alone. I never been the type of person delving my business in public forums; I won't start now.  Everything is cool. I didn't go to Bar 13 yesterday as my buttons were pushed royally last night. I decided it was best to go home and just enjoy an evening of TV. I wanted to finish Bodega dreams but the book is bordering on disgusting now. Disgusting that I am going to write a poem dedicated to this motherfucker that did a disservice by writing this book.   I am debating on reading DaVinci code, Down these mean streets, or When I was Puerto Rican. I have noticed that reading books has been keeping me pretty calm these days. I started reading to get a feel of what was going on in the minds of these poet fucks. Now, I am doing it after I have found an enjoyment out of it.  I am featuring with Oscar and Bone for Machismo re-defined at the Nuyo tomorrow. It should be fun. Back in the fray

      ......bare with me.  Dear Tolerance;  you and I have known each other for a long time. We have embraced each other in times where I never knew it was possible. One thing I have noticed was the fact you always drag that other dude around; patience. I know some where in my life I gave patience a good chance and I always got along with him. I never had a problem with you but today; I do.  Tolerance, bare with me as I think you and I need to part ways.  As you and I have had a troubled and rocky relationship; time to walk.   Just let me be for a while  Fish

      ....does the throbbing pulse from the vein in my neck expand further with the whisper of your hurt a soft uncertainity between want and needs gazing upon moonlit rooftops clouds baring down;  blocking suns razorblade memories acid breathe your name rides heavy on my halted thoughts burn the rooftops to avoid memories slash soft skin to reveal scars of what was clear the fields with sickle swipes tell me" Do you know what is pain ?" air burdened with heavyset monotone pleasantries slicing pressure with undo kindness Thunder overcomes my screams I kneel to the Gods under charring skies Clouds blackened with failed kisses; Lined with good-bye gazes Nights filled with uneasy calms that are far too long Pour the blood at my feet melt the faces of wanton bravery  break the calm of river waters cold colors of the sun bending time let me bathe in what I will be alone

      - Van Helsing is eye candy; it's worse the second time around.  - I bumped into a friend of mine that I have not seen since I graduated high School ( 1989 ). I looked to my right and I said " Doris " and this girl looked at me like I had 13 heads. I took off my shades and she jumped on me like I was her long lost brother.  15 some odd years have passed and our friendship was tight as the day we left. Her boyfriend wasn't an asshole at least. We spoke and exchanged numbers and hopefully we all can chill.   - I was hanging with Eric yesterday and had a very bad hair day. We joked all day on the side of my hair looking PUFFED!  - WWE JUdgment day was serious last night. I turned it on in the last match. Bradshaw and Eddie Guerrero and it had to be the bloodiest match I have seen in Wrestling. Stone cold was bloodied one time so bad he was streaming blood; Guerrero matched him.  - Bodega dreams sucks  - I am buying a new cell phone today  -  I am taking a workshop tomorrow  - I am performing for Machismo re-defined on Wednesday  - I'm a poet  - Elder hasn't changed  - My Lobster and biggest Oscar fought all weekend. The lobster is getting the better of the Oscar  - My turtle ( pablo ) is getting bigger. He eats more then a normal turtle. He like pernil; he must have some Puerto Rican in him.

      A couple of months ago, I wrote an entry about some model types I saw on 5th ave at a flagship grand opening of "MEXX". I wrote " out of 100, I would have fucked 99". This is the mentality I have while watching Troy yesterday.   I figured the movie should pander both my eyes and my intellect in cinama antics and dialogue diatribe.   I was rather hesitant seeing this flick after Gladiator, Scorpion King, Braveheart and even Ben Hur. I was even more stand offish after seeing Brad pitt in the starring role. Let me get to the movie.......  The movie was above average and I wasn't pissed after I left.  The constant tug of war between Agamemmnon and Achilles( Brad Pitt) was great in giving the movie that push of reality or believability. Even though a king in those days would have chopped Achilles head off; it was good to see the best warrior of the Greek era not bowing to a king like most movies. The constant pursuit by one king to rule the world and love thrown in the mix made the movie so-so. Some of the fight scenes held their own but we've seen thousands fight already.   My main problem with this flick was Brad pitt being too fuckin pretty. He was fabio with a fuckin sword. He was the super model of the Grecian wars. His skills in the movie were crazy and he killed many of men. Yet, he is sooooooo pretty I can't see him killing so many people. If that push between the king and pitt wasn't there; the movie would have sucked.   Pitt's character was great in that rebellious sense. He went against the grain but we have seen that before.   If Bradd pitt had a clue; use the fight club character in troy and the movie would have been golden.  One scene in the movie had Pitt fighting an army and not one ounce of " true" dirt on his face.   " Chip a tooth, chop that long flowing mane off, get some dirt on your face"  The movie was ok and worth your 10 bucks. Of course, I didn't pay for it so I can't complain that much.  Peace

      I don't have the slightest clue when it comes down to these shows on CNN,CSNBC,MSNBC,FOXNEWS, etc.....etc.   I stood home yesterday( far cry from my usual Friday jauntings) I needed some rest regardless. I think it was more of time away from the Poetry.   After some cleaning and hanging of a new movie poster; the boob tube and I bonded. I came across some Bill O'Reily and his show. The topic  was rap music and the effect it has on younger folk. On the show was damon dash; founder and CEO of Roc-a-fella records, Cam'ron; a rapper, some principal from an urban school in America.  I was amazed at how that KKK loving O'reily was skewing the conversation and twisting words around. Damon Dash held his own and made some very good points. Cam'ron's and asshole.   O'reily: Do you think your music has an effect on children?  Since your music does not promote a positive reflection on life, how can it be positive for children?  You rap about everyday things from your urban upbringing; how is that positive?     Those are the one's I remember but if you don't see those are loaded questions ready- you's a fool.  Does rap effect children??? Of course it does. I levy rap to the poetry I teach to the inmates at Rikers. They will only listen/read to what they can relate too. Not everyone is like Bonafide, Oscar, or even like me. People who grew up in the ghetto but had enough thirst to seek out other music besides Rap. Rap was thrusted down our throats at some points and living in the ghetto; that was typical.  Back in the day Hot 103.5 ( now hot 97.1) played Freestyle and house the majority of the time. Some rap found it's way to the radio but it was a happy time of pre-pop and fast love songs. When the move happened and Rap found a home; shit flew. Gangsta rap in the early 90's was pretty heavy. I never viewed it as Gangsta rap, it was more reality rap.  If people are getting shot up and a rapper writes about it; this makes him an urban reporter. Liz Cho reads the news and no one gets on her for delivering the heartache's of the ghetto. Biggie raps about the ghetto and he is a gangsta.  Rap is as diverse as anything in life. When rapping about the ghetto; you have everything from good to bad. This is when you have to educate yourself and figure out which rap music would be suitable for your child.  Most of the rap these days is not that bad. I am not to heavy on the " bitches, ho's, pimp's, and bling". Then again, it's better then having some dude come out and say "he'll bust you in the head/ until your dead/ cause you have no street cred"  Would I stop my kids from listening to rap?? Nahhh..... I will let them know life isn't all about what they rap about. Rap is just like the newspapers; they only feed you what they " think " you want to hear. For every subject someone raps about; there are about 50 you haven't heard.    Favorite rappers  1 Nas 2 KRS-One 3 Public enemy 4 Tupac 5 Biggie 6 Big-pun 7 Fat joe 8 Chad-eo 9 Remy Martin 10 DMX  Least Favorite Rappers 1 P-diddy, puffy, sean combs,  2 Mase 3 Anything southern 4 Anything from  "2 live cru " 5 Fabolous 6 Memphis Bleek 7 Bow-wow, little Romeo 8 Master P   Peace 7

      .......currently in the land of " Blah, blah, blah ".  One of my biggest arguments about the beheading of Nick Berg was the physical description of his executioners.  They were all tall and they didn't look Arabic to me. After some jostling back and forth last night and Roger making a point. I searched for a better copy of the video. I got it and I was pretty amazed how wrong my perception was. When I thought they all had gloves in one grainy tape; the clearer one shows much more detail.  To be honest, it's all water under the bridge for me at this point.  War is not pretty, killing is not pretty. I still am sticking to my guns and saying there is much more then " just a beheading ".  Last night was a good night for me. I headed to celebrate Ed Garcia's birthday at a small bar called " Company". It sounds more like an underground elitist agency with a strong concentration on spying. I normally like to stay home and not come home to fight for parking. Ed garcia is one of those people that I will definitely go and support his projects, brithday's, celebrations. He has been there much more then he has to for us and it is just right to see some love thrown his way.   I got there pretty early as those late entrances were never my thing. I sat and spoke to Omar and Ed about High School, life, work, and a variety of stupid shit. Several of the regular borg dwellers showed up and we had a great night.  The highlight of my night was when I was saying I went into a peeping booth years ago and I slipped and busted my ass. Put the story together.   Peeping booth Porn video privacy tile floor  I slip and bust my ass. If you don't know what I fell on; you need to delve deeper into the porn industry. Omar comes out and says he had a friend who used to Janitor those booth and he used to mop the ceiling! I almost died laughing. It was a good evening and I enjoyed myself. I took my typical walk to canvass the area to find something interesting besides the joint we were patronizing. Behold around the corner; it was the famous bar called " Coyote Ugly".  Complete with Bartender's dancing on the Bar top. Bras and Panties on the moosehead in the corner; and the evil smirking bald bouncer with an inkling to throw someone out on their ass. One small detail folks, the bartender dancing on the bar was about attractive as Roseanne in a Thong. It was sooooo not pretty.  I came home last night and I unfolded the Van helsing poster I have for my apartment. The thing is 10 feet by 40 feet long. I am going to paper the whole wall with the poster. I think it is going to look awesome.   I am good today.  I started reading Bodega Dreams by Ernesto Rodriguez. I am already 50 pages in. The book is good but I am not believing much of what he is writing. As entertaining as it is; the all knowing drug kingpin of a neighborhood isn't as believable as it once was.   Willie Bodega seems more myth then legend to me. We see as I finish the book today. Yes, I will fly through this book because it is an easy read for me. Everything he wrote I have lived.

      .........I have soooo much to write about. It's just a matter of " WHAT " I will write. I could start off with the fish flakes but that will take up toooo much of my two page limit entry.  I finished reading this book; The Red Tent by Anita Diamant, yesterday. The book is the brainchild of the Raise Red Tent format for the LouderMONDAYS series at Bar 13. I was always interested in getting into the brains of the women of louder and picking it dry.  I figured I would start by reading this book. I won't give ya the impression I have read hundreds of books. The red tent is probably book number 30 or 40 in 33 years of my life. I should be somewhere in the thousands from a personal standpoint.   The book is written very nicely. The author flowed vividly and transitioned between stories right when you knew it was about to happen. With the content being Biblically historical fiction; it was something completely new for me.  The book was a far cry from starting a feminist movement but it did show the beautiful life of a midwife who sought happiness even in the worst times of despair.  The positive impact the strong bonds formed between the women in the first tribe of canaanites were completely striking to me. Those bonds followed the main character through most of her life. As she dared to dream happiness and fulfillment; she received it when you least expect it.   When anyone asks me about the Red Tent; I will say the book stands for love, community, bonds through womenhood, and happiness through the love of life with family; most of all, the book shows sacrifice.   I joked with Maria; the owner of the book; how Jacob was a pimp with 4 wives but that was just a small part of this book. I would suggest this book. Shit, If I liked it and it makes me understand "Raise the Red tent " a little bit better; I am happy.  *******************  American Idol sucks ass. I am probably the only one in NYC that dares say " That show fucking sucks". Middle America who has no clue what talent is votes off the best singers. I am comparing America to slam. Vote for the best singer with the most talent; stop that sympathy voting shit.  I will definitely butt fuck Simon Cowell if I catch him in a dark alley. Randy Jackson is a droppy skinned bitch. Paula....... I don't have enough time to write about her.  *******************  I have to read " Bodega Dreams " next. Can I borrow this book please. Whenever you have a chance  ********************  Hatemail to the people that posted video of Nick Berg ( dude that got the dome chopped off )  Sent: Wednesday, May 12, 2004 4:44 PM To: Marc Subject: American decapitation video  I can't believe you liberal pieces of shit would condone something like this.  If any of you fuckin scumbags have a problem with this country and what we  are doing, get the fuck out. I could barely watch what they showed on the news  and i dont even want to see the whole thing. You people are fuckin white trash  scumbag losers with too much time on your hands. That sux that you people  can't find better things to do than sit and watch a horrific thing like this and  have the balls to say it's reality and what goes on over there. That's not what  goes on. Our soldiers didnt do anything close to this and he wasnt even a  soldier. The only thing our troops did wrong was get caught, but they still would  not have done something like us. Now i know all you liberals would rather  give money to trailer parkers on welfare with ten kids, but that isnt how things  are gonna be right now so get the fuck over it and start showing a little  pride for your country and those who help defend it. Im gonna do my best to get  people away from this scum infested website and hopefully some day it'll be  closed. And CKY, your a fuckin jerkoff, yeah lets show the videos of our troops  beating them up right before the video of them chopping off the head of a  civilian who volunteered to help the war effort. Good idea asshole. CONSERVATIVE!  p.s. how do you think his parents would feel if they saw his son's terrible  death all over the internet cause of scumbags like you. Or even better, how  would your parents feel. Have some consideration dirt bag.  Marc's Response:  In short, fuck off. In longer version, the bottom line is that we're showing  what other news organizations don't have the balls to show: the truth.  >  Wrong, it did happen. Whether you like it or not it did. You're saying just  b/c the US soldiers aren't killing people that somehow makes the video not  real? AND more importantly you ignorant fuck, this IS what's being done by US  troops. You should actually try and do a little research before you bitch. Watch  CNET. There have been 3 confirmed homicides in the jail in Iraq that those  pictures came from.  > "The only thing our troops did wrong was get caught, but they still would  >  Are you fucking kidding me? You're saying there was nothing wrong with US  soldiers abusing the prisoners?  > "Now i know all you liberals would rather give money to trailer parkers on  >  Rehashing and regurgitating the propaganda you've been taught. Try having  some original thought. This has NOTHING to do with Liberal vs. Conservative. God,  I hate your type of redneck. Anything or anyone that actually disagrees with  the government is immediately labeled "Liberal" and ignored. This is about  human rights. Murder is wrong. Abuse is wrong. No matter who is doing it! Just to be clear: what happened to that US civilian is horrible, fuck-up, and  CANNOT be justified. I personally don't think we should be in Iraq. I think  we're doing our country a grave disservice and slaughtering our credibility in  the world's eyes. Does that mean for one second I condemn or in any way don't  support our troops. FUCK NO. Our soldiers are doing what their country told  them to do. Being a soldier doesn't give you the luxury of worrying about  politics. You do what you're told. They're ALL heroes for dropping their lives,  risking their lives, and doing what their government says needs to be done. BUT  the soldiers that crossed the line and violated those Iraqis' human rights went  too far. That is when soldiers do have to think for themselves. They should be  prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  >  As I said, I support the troops for doing their jobs. But tell me how Dubbya  ordering the invasion of Iraq is defending the US. The rest of the world hates  us more now than in the history of our country. Where are the weapons of mass  destruction? NO WHERE. Weapons of Mass Distraction are more like it.  > "gonna do my best to get people away from this scum infested website and  >  Fucking hypocrite. You obviously come to CJ all the time. We're an offensive  website, what the fuck do you expect. Go on your little crusade. Anyone that  would listen to you I won't miss.  > "lets show the videos of our troops beating them up right before the video  >  Abso-fucking-lutely. I agree. If we get those videos we'll damn sure post  them. We show what's out there. You figure out how to deal with it.  > "how do you think his parents would feel if they saw his son's terrible  >  I've been asked that question by better than you. Just finished up an  interview w/ a reporter from the NY Times and she asked the same question. Here's the  answer: Just like everyone else, they have a choice whether or not to look at  it. I promise, they're too busy dealing with their grief to come to our site.  My opinion is that the pain they will have from seeing it is far outweighed  by the value in showing the world what's really happening. What's going on over  there, in my humble opinion, will be the biggest thing in all of our lives.  We will be dealing with the ramifications of this conflict for the rest of our  lives. The more people can be informed the better. We hear about murders all  the time on the news. We're de-sensitized to it. BUT, when we see it in all  it's gory details is grabs our attention and forces us to deal with it. The TRUTH  is never a bad thing. Give me one good reason why something that is real  should be censored. If you're rational and honest, you can't. In the words of Jack  Nicholson "you can't handle the truth."       ***************************  Peace,Love, Porkchops   Fish

      ........ a little bit somber today and it is bordering on fuckin mad. Yesterday the news came out about a white boy in Iraq that was kidnapped a couple of weeks ago.  Not many people knew of his whereabouts until a video came out showing how he died.   Now, believe it or not; I have some scrupples left and I will not direct you to which site you can see the video.   I saw the video yesterday and I can say that it actually bothered me.  Not the way he died; people suffer worse fates then a beheading. Just his family having to know their sons head was chopped off and now the video shoots across the internet like wildfire.  It's really sad that technology can be used for these purposes.  This Iraq shit hasn't phased me since it's republican inception. Now- I think I hit that mark where I will be more vocal about it.  It's insane because it is reminding me of a ghetto turf war we were a part of back in the day.  The Elder kats went over and took over Ward ave. Ward kats wanted us out and the shit hit the fan many time. Over and over again: fights, stabbings, beatdowns.  They grab one of us, we grab one of them. They grab two of us we grab two of them.   That is what is playing out in this bullshit war.  They attack an outpost and kill a soldier or two. The soldiers kill an " Insurgent " or two. I think of what an Insurgent is; a person who acts contrary to policy or authority.  Well, For some reason I am believing the definition of "insurgency" is being painted with broad strokes. Too many Iraqi citizens have died. Don't get me wrong- I am not too happy that they are killing U.S Soldiers.  I could just see the pop-shots in the middle of the night and women, kids, getting killed.   It's one thing the United States being there trying to establish control. Taking over and keeping your finger in there for years to come is another. If the Iraqi people want the U.S out; what the fuck; LEAVE! You caught Saddam and killed his kids. The whole deck of wanted loyalist to Saddam have been caught or killed. No WMD's have been found.  Nothing but wasted tax-payer money and meaningless death every single fuckin day.  It bugs me when a soldier is killed but when a civilian is kidnapped and his head is chopped off and broadcast around the world; that shit is not cool.  The protest come and go but nothing stays long enough to make waves.  If fly by night protesters beef for 3 hours but remain quieted the remainder of the time- shut the fuck up. The almighty full of shit media is not keeping the truth behind rating curtains.  If morals and values had a candle; hold it to the coffins that come home at 2 in the morning under the cover of darkness. No cameras, no coverage, no reporters. These guerilla tactic filled paparazzi will follow J-lo to the ends of the earth but they don't have the balls to follow the sacrifices of true men and women. You thought I was going to say " Hero "? Fuck that, they are men and women that are doing there jobs. Hero's are the mother's , fathers, wives, brothers, sisters, who will be forever scarred by burying a loved one who joined the armed forces in hopes of a better education, life, career.  Give me a gun, fill it with 21 shots, label each shot with the reasons why the United states needs to stop invading other countries. 21 shots is not enough?? Well, next to my feet is a box that will continually be filled with rounds until the day I die.  I will keep shooting that gun in the air until I am heard.   " Yo George, let it go. You already look like an asshole. Dick is a heart Attack waiting to happen. Donny screams KKK and you think America doesn't notice?? Do you want to hear the voice of the people??? Here goes: Bring em all home George. Chalk it up as an experience worth learning from.  Your dad has his fingers so tight around your neck we can see the capillaries bursting with each word you try to enunciate; correctly or incorrectly. Let it go George, let it go "  Fish  P.S To the secret service  Fuck you all too

      Stick with me until the end and I will answer this question.  It is now 2am and I have gone through an array of emotions that I never knew crept inside of me. I was already nervous as fuck early this morning at 10am. I even called Rog to ask a couple of questions and bust a joke or two.  The time clicked closer and my nerves were in check. Of course after throwing up about 4 times in a span of 2 hours doesnít make this competition thing pretty.  The slammers were set and placed in their prospective order and off to the races we went.  Rich drew the wonderful slot of first but he did something I never seen him do; he channeled God directly and fucking opened up to a 28.7.  That is how you start a slam and I knew it was going to be interesting. Slammers 2 and 3 were a blur as was the rest of the night. I went up there with all my confidence and delivered a solid performance with not one mistake; practice paid off. Judges thought different as I was awarded a 25.1.  After my set ñ I pulled a marty and went straight to the hallway. I couldnít fucking breathe and my throat tightened up like if  I swallowed a beeís nest. I came back inside to hear the score and I knew my work was cut out for me. This is where the blur started and I needed to bring the next round hard.   Round two came and I was the last poet to go since I had the lowest score. In order for me to get to the next round,  I had to better Jai to at least pull out the big gun poems. Jai had a 25.3 in the previous round and he garnered a 26.6 in the second round.  I needed a 26.8 to move ahead ( I think ) and my one minute poem was delivered to a great response from the crowd. Judges score: 26.7. I missed the 3rd round by  .1 ! After I knew it was over, I heald back the initial shock of it all being over until they called my name and I bowed out gracefully to the crowd and went outside to unwind, relax, and cry.  I missed all the poets in round three. I didnít want to deal with everyone asking me ì are you ok ?î, ì You did well ì. I wasnít quite ready to deal with anyone and I refused to let anyone keep me company in my moment of misery.  How did I feel ??? I donít know. I stood around out of sportmanship to see the team that is going to be sent to Nats.  I went up there and hugged and gave my all. I waited to fill up inside but I came home empty. I left everything on the stage tonight and It will take me a little while to find it; about 2 days.   I worked hard to come to this point and the last year has been a worldwind experience. My first year slamming and I make the finals by the grace of who knows who.  My writing is growing and I can see bigger things in the future. Right now, itís so on next year. The work is growing and that  . 1 isnít shit in my eyes. Tonight, I got my respect from my peers and I got some serious love from the poets.  The final tally??? Mike Cirelli, Roger, Mahogany all tied for first place. Abena and Rich grabbed 4th and 5th.  Yes, my nigger Rich made the team.  It was hard not to be there cheering like a mad man but inside of me, mi hermanito is going to Nats.  Was it all worth it?? Yes it is. I learned alot from this finals and I will definitely use it towards the future. Being in the mix is stressful but rewarding t say the least. With tighter work delivered one inch from itís life; itís on.   Acentos will rep hard at nats with Rich. The ladies will rep hard with Abena. Rog will be Rog.  I feel good and I could say that I made the Bar 13 Slam Finals. I didnít make the team but itís just been a solid year.  One more year and itís on.  Thanks for the love   Thank you Lenny for coming home with me and seeing me cry too much  Congrats guys  Peace  Fish

      ...........of what's to come; life is going to suck.  I am updating from the crib to avoid the shit talking from the bosses that I spend too much time behind my computer. Thing is, I don't have sit to write about.  Well, from when I write this- 12 more hours until first blood is drawn in the slam tonight. If I am not ready by now, I don't deserve shit. I wanted to call people to chit chat last night but the only thing on the people's minds are " are you ready?, Aren't you nervous?". Shit, I wanted to hear something besides poetry yesterday.  Oh, here is something good. I was talking to Mike on Saturday and the subject of favorite firearm came to the surface. I have always fancied the Glock 20; 40 cal. He comes out and says its a typical thug ghetto gun. I am quick to argue this point because I know for a fact Glocks are one of the best firearms out there. Getting to the point - Glocks no longer sell multi-capacity magazines. I was hurt when he told me this.  When I had my glock, it was a 17 and one { 17 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber}. Here I am thinking " wow, that is a significant number of less shots ". Why the fuck would anyone need 17 shots in the streets you ask ? Well, when you are a loner and you engage a group bigger then 4 or 5 - the more shots the merrier.    Off to work to leave early  The mind has to be clear today  Fish  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      -	Rich went to Rikers and his butthole is still intact. Smooth class and Rich was awesome. Keito showedup and he was great assisting Rich; The book of genesis according to St Miguelito.  -	Nuyo was the nuyo. Daniel Beatty won the slam. Desiree had the tightest writing. Carlos Gomez made providence along with Jive Poetic. Vanessa was looking hot. The open room was actually kinda packed  -	I donít think I will ever trust the sanctity of a relationship that will lead to more committed waters.  I have my reasons  -	I have no clue why I bounced at a club for so many years. And yes; I do have balls to go to the club where I bounced and looked at all the motherfuckers that hated me with a smile.  -	I missed Salon Lucero; duties of a brother called  -	I divulged wayyyy tooo much info about some private things in my life to Eric  -	I lost a good friend the other day. We have decided to keep going our seperate ways.    -	Still practicing  -	Wish me luck tommorrow  Fish  -

      I love our little game of " Guessing the score of the poet before the poet finishes the poem". It makes the night very very interesting.  Rog killed it with 6 wins but he didn't guess the team. Ed didn't get one win but he guessed the team in the order plus the alternate.   So, I will give a tie to Rog and Ed in yesterday's pool.  Well, last night was the Grand slam of all slams at the Bowery. Well, nothing suprising. The 2004 Urbana team is this.........  Celena Glenn George Mckibbons RAC McKibbons Anis  Alternate Taylor Mali  Nothing surprising except for Anis making the team. I am happy as Fuck that George and RAC made this team together. This means on Monday....... They will not Slam.  I think Celena Glenn will step down also. Coming up from the doldroms will be Morgan Janssen,  Diane Roy, and Mo Brown.  After Diane wrote some scathing non-sense in her blog- who knows where her head is and if she will actually come and slam at 13. I would find it genuinely hypocritcal and full of shit if she does come through with some bogus excuse.  Thing is, I know that chic well enough and I know that she thrives on drama and getting under people's skin. I personally would like to see her come through and slam. Why??  It creates a much more competitive atmosphere and the ante will be brought up.  If she chooses not to; I won't mind neither as Rich will have a chance to make the team then. It's a win win in my eyes.  As the biased side of me wants to see Rich, Bonafide, Myself and the Dominican Roger make the team; I just have to just give it 100 % and accept the chips where they may.  I was hanging and having great conversation with Beau yesterday and he has been so far out of the loop in slam. He was giving these hi scores and it was hilarious how far off he was. He said some key things at the spectacle slam has become. I counter that it has but the true writers are the one's getting up there and doing it. Sans the greybeard mentality; the Urbana team has some strong writers. They are not new voices but their shit is tight. Anis will definitly get better under the watchful eyes of  Taylor. That is a plus for him and he better take advantage of it.  Alot of people are already saying Roger has a definite slot on the team. Me personally, that shit is bogus. 9 poets are going into this and it will be equal footing. Shit, I think that Bonafide could take Rog out with a good round. Shit, I am getting cocky and don't sleep on the fat puerto rican man. It will be brought Monday!!  Well, the weekend will be good as I have a couple of things going on.  I am hangin out with a friend that we need to air out some shit after not speaking for months.  I also need a good steak really really bad.  Hasta pasta Rasta  Fish

      I come to the blog with all intent purposes on last nights jaunt at the Blue Ox for the Bronx council of the Arts Culture trolley First Wednesday series featuring Taylor Mali. Of course; my eyes wander to other blogs and I get thrown out of wack.  I hit the favorite menu drop down and I pick them at random. Guy hasn't updated much and my interest in his blog has weened dramatically.  I click on it and see one of the best post he has ever written to anyone or anybody. Besides the love that I know he has for his wife; I never thought he could have such a genuine love and admiration for someone in the poetry scene. This dude has been jaded and dare I say even fed up with much of the bullshit on the scene. I could never blame the dude for lashing out and being his incendiary jackass self towards the scene. Scary thing is, that motherfucker speaks the truth and I agree with him about 75% of the time.   What he wrote about Bassey is something well deserved. That girl is neurotic at best but she has a good heart and I never could take that away from her.   After reading his blog I figure " let me head over to Bassey's blog". Turns out that she entered a pissed off entry because someone tried to......well........... enter her apartment forcefully.  Can you blame her for wanting to move?? Do I feel that she would be going against the grain and leaving " her " people behind while she treks to the safe haven of the upper west side ? Uh......   " Bassey...... Bounce the fuck out. The same people around your " hood " are the first one's that will rob you "  I am speaking from the perspective from a former hood rat.  I told Roger one time the Bronx is  full of sheisty ass folks that will rob your last dollar from your pocket and smile when it is happening.  I even have a line in my Bronx poem  " Watson Brings the lowest and yet the savviest"  Where I grew up: we are straight shiesty. We never had a problem going into an apartment where the local domincan drug dealer had over 50 g's in drug proceeds and making " personal Withdrawls ".  Girl..... The upper west side is calling you.  Yesterday was a great day as Acentos took over the Blue OX on a Wednesday and made it our own. It was a sparse crowd and I was suprised no one; I really mean no one; got out of the trolley to hear Taylor Mali at his best.  With Oscar being the special guest host; you thought I was joking about the take over?; everything was ripe for a practice run for Monday's finals.   Taylor was already at the Blue Ox when I got there at 7pm sharp. He fit in quite well and didn't have that " I am lost in the Bronx " look on his face. We had some good conversation and I asked him........  " Why in the hell did you take that President position at PSI ?"  Since personal conversations are just that, personal. We will keep the etiquette of the blog consistent.    Oscar opened the evening and took full advantage of a new crowd searching for poetry. He dropped two good pieces and started the open mic.  I headed ip after him and dropped my new 1 minute piece and my Perdido en la calle nene with the new body movements I have tried to interpret into the piece. Taylor liked it and asked if I was doing that on Monday. I am putting it all on the line in the first round and I hope it pays off.  Rich read a new piece as he knows how. Tim rocked out with his pieces. The fast up and coming cinnamon gorilla Eliel rocked out with two pieces. I think he is finding his voice and now it's time to pursue his delivery.   Up comes Mr Taylor Mali slightly buzzed after the signature Blue ox Shot. He lost his mind yesterday and it was the best that I have seen him.  He should rock hard tonight in the slam and I will be rooting for my newly minted " Favorite older white boy poet ". Matt still holds title but the younger version.  I had a great time at the Blue Ox but my patience was tested when I was playing pool with this knuckle head last night.  He had a good run of the table and I had 6 balls to run to catch up to him trying to sink the 8 ball. I got into pool mood cuase this dude tried to hustle me and I ran the 6 balls but I had a little trouble with the 8 so I played defense and left the ball at one end of the table and he had no way in hell to shoot the eight. Then he looked at the eight ball for 5 minutes; aimed; got up; put his cue down and said he had to go take a piss. If you had to go piss, go piss and then come take your shot. He was wasting my time. He went to the bathroom and I grabbed the eight ball and forfeited the game . I hate playing at Bars with motherfuckers who think they are fats domino re-incarnated as Jennette Lee. Shoot your game and take your loss as a man.  Even when I walked in this old man that my man whooped the other day asked if I could shoot some pool. He stated " I would love to learn a little on how to play the game ". I told him " You can't shoot and I have seen you play, don't try to hustle me like I am an asshole!. My man whooped you the other day and you cried that he wasn't calling his shots". Real men that know how to play this game do not have to call every single shot.    That was my night  I came home and I stopped off at White Castle's and my stomach is screaming for a forensics specialist because what is coming out of my ass is not right.  Peace. love, Porkchops  Fish

      Ladies and gentleGERMS; today in Washington Square park will be the world record attempt between couples kissing it out. So at 3pm, head over with your significant other and kiss at the alotted time and try to make it into the guiness book of world records.   Last night was one of those nights. In an endless pursuit of finding an open mic to practice for Monday-Verbal Rayne in Mount Vernon was my stop. How can I say this nicely??  WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY PLUGGING IT AND NO ONE WAS THERE?!!! I hate this shit. I jump in the hooptie knowing parking will be a bitch when I come back and I head out there. I get there and the place is closed.  Not a soul  lingering out or about. So for the curators of Verbal rayne in Mount Vernon; You are all straight up full of shit! IF you can't keep it going, let the shit go!  When I was coming home yesterday, I made my stop at the Pet store. I brought a small lobster to throw in my Fish tank. Well, it's not really a lobster. It is more like a diesel Crawfish.  In the fish tank you have to have a certain fish that serves a purpose.   Catfish eat algae off the glass Oscar are for show but eat smaller weaker fish that get sick- those sick fish won't get others sick Tinfoils are fast and run from Oscars Oscars get exercise chasing tinfoils Crawfish eat leftover food in the gravel ( rocks )  There is a method to the madness of  an Aquarium hobbyist.  I had some interesting dreams last night.  I didn't get good sleep because I was thinking over some issues in my life. Firstly- I never felt so alone in the poetry world as I do now.  I know that I have always prided myself on doing everything for me and me only. Now, I know for a fact that I am standing alone on my little island with no company. If my island turns into quicksand, I will die alone.  Back to the dream; it was just weird.  Dream sequence....... I was walking to a college gig of some sort with two black chics that were speaking nothing but french. It is weird for me because those are two of the most far fetched things to cross my mind. I don't  think I have thought about something french in years.  So here I am walking to this college and it is raining hardcore. Wait- did I mention that I was naked and wrapped in a blanket???  I hate walking around naked and here I am with two french talking black chics  naked as a jaybird wrapped in an argyle blanket! Why?? I have no clue.  Tonight is the true meaning of gentrification of the South Bronx! As Taylor Mali heads to the Blue Ox Bar to Feature for the Bronx Council on the Arts Culture trolley " First Wednesday " series! Taylor has never stepped foot in the Bronx ( to my understanding ) and he will be there tonight! I should get every ghetto thug that I know to descend on the blue ox.  It is an open mic and I will be able to practice my new 1 min piece there tonight. I might ask leslie to rock out with two pieces and do Perdido with the new body motions I have been practicing.  We see  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      why 5 rounds of poetry ?  why a 1 minute round?  I'm tired   Rikers seems to be something from the past. Warden doesn't want to have classes taught after 5:30pm.  I have a day job  Groove Nation has to be called Chocolate City or better yet Negro Noise  I was in a good mood last night  Why do some people refuse to wear deoderant?  Why do I shave my balls? It serves no purpose having hair there or not. It makes no sense.    Better yet: Why do women shave? Those a la naturelle porno's from back in the day were the shit  Eliel's a funny mothefucker  Marty Has too much hair; She needs to shave it off  The feature last night was totally old school and he rocked out  I am giving up  I can't do it any more  Sleeping alone gets lonely  I need a dog  My turtle needs company  Seikou looks like a cartoon  Blogs are starting to bore me  I am going to Albany Saturday  Life is hard

      I would never do to someone what I don't want done to me. I always use this motto in friendships, relationships, associates etc.  It gets difficult sometimes to deal with those awkward moments ending a relationship or a friendship but I firmly believe that everything is possible.  I have no qualms maintaining a freindship after a relationship. I understand that it is difficult and it probably takes more work after the end then anything else. The one thing that is hard for me is to deal with is the after effects of a relationship when they move on. I have no problems with people moving on; just don't do it, flaunt, or do it in front of me. This is why when my realtionships end, I never start anything with the remote possiblity of previous said relationship coming in contact with the newness. I tend to say it's a " respect " issue. It is more of the asshole in me to be honest.  Some people are better then me ten-fold when it comes to this. I am not. I can not see the person I was with bringing someone into my little world.  A piece of me feels it is selfish but that is my issue that I have to deal with.  If I am with someone for several years and we break up- respect me in having your next relationship a distance from me. Just like everything takes time to heal. I need my time for even that much.   That is definitely a fault and I should start working on that. As it goes for now; I have no time for that .  Fish

      Sometimes when you do something for the love and nothing else; the reward is bigger then anything you can possibly give me.   Since Rich Villar was hosting the open room at the Nuyo; support of my hero pimp is of no question. After my exit of teaching my poetry class at Rikers I headed out there to enjoy the wonderful weather and some poetry.   I drove by first and I see a very sick looking Julio at the door.  I parked the hooptie and kept him company from 9pm or so. After some cordial conversation; he goes inside and I take the door for the next hour and change. Talk about feeling right at home at that chair. Lois came to me and we started talking about some things back and forth concerning the nuyo an some people on the scene. It amazes me how loose some tongues are in this world.  I always come to my own conclusion concerning people and judgement is only for me to pass.   Karen shows up and I am loving her more and more. You can tell a person is genuine is just the way they hug you; Karen has that. More cordial conversation and before I could blink- I am agreeing to slam. What better way to get practice for the Bar 13 finals then to rock out on the Nuyo Stage.  Three rounds of memorized poems and I did quite well. I didnít win but yesterday was the day that I had the most fun on that stage. Win it or not; semiís are over. Winning yesterday was a mute point from what I saw.    One of the highest scoring slams I have seen at the Nuyo and I was in it. I had a fuckin ball last night. I was joking and just actin a fool. I think that seeped over when the crowd gave me nothing lower then a  9.3 the whole night. this Young kat from Jersey won and he did his thing.  The nuyo is the nuyo  It was a good night. Oh- I have a new motto!!  Whatever happens at the Nuyo stays at the Nuyo!!! These two girls came outside and they were some over the top issue pushing women.  I wonít make mention as to what they did and what WE ALL ENGAGED in but is was a memorable evening.   It was a good night. I came home wanted to have some company at a diner but all my calls went unanswered.   A lone walk home  Club bed was off the hook  Peace

      I wasn't going to do it but I might as well. Afer reading urlLink Rich's  blog and seeing he jumped into the conversation we had on the ride home; I might as well get into it.  We touched last night on the topic of religion. First and formost, I will not give you this sense that I am an expert on religion. I am far from it.   In my life I could count the number of times I have voluntarily entered a church on my own. Excluding funerals; I could count it on my right hand.    The proper way to properly decribe my crisis of faith is to explain most of the shit I have gone through. Of course we have no time for every detail of every fuck up that I CHOSE to partake in.  Now here is the one thing that I have to stress. I have gone through more shit then the average joe. You know what; I wake up with regrets everyday. Those were my choices and I have to deal with them. If God is going to judge me on those choices according catholicism; I am destined for a warm and toasty eternity in hell.   The one thing that I will never say is that I condone all the WRONG SHIT I have done.  I am not going around and justifying the beatings that I gave out under an umbrella of self righteousness. I know everytime I beat somebody's ass; it's wrong. I still go ahead and do it knowing it's wrong and that makes it worse in my eyeballs.  So that whole shit about doing something wrong but thinking you are right to justify your means is out  the window in my eyes.  So if you step to any of my boys, family, pompous poet friends with the intent to harm them; I am going to beat you until you are no longer a threat. Is it wrong??? yes. Will that stop me from doing it?? no.   I always felt religion is nothing more then a comforting olive branch for the " unknowing". It is also a means of getting mankind to walk a straight line of creating a fear of the "unknown".   I am 6'1 and 230 pounds and I am currently living in 150BC. I catch some little thief bastard killing and eating my chickens. I proceed to get my largest machete to carve his ass up into next weeks meal for my pigs. He tells me.... If you touch me; I have my God that will strike you down and curse your family. I will stop and think about it for a few seconds. Maybe he does have something almighty and powerful I don't quite fully comprehend it. The 150BC fish will probably take him off my land not to anger his God. The 2004 Fish will feed that motherfucker to the homeless.  Religion; like law; was created, coerced, constructed for the purpose to level out the playing field amongst man.  Without law nor religion, we would have plenty of dead people lying in the gutters.   I lost my faith and I lost my love for the unknown. Soooo........  Here goes  Dear God  Stop Aids, Cancer, Human bombs in the middle east, and get Bush out of office within the next 5 mins; then I might get my faith back.  Fish  5 mins past  Nope..... everything is the same  When I die; I will still blog and let everyone knows what is going on  Peace

      Many of you know that my life dealt with everything violent until I got locked up. Facing 60 years to life brings new perspective to your being. LOL  Anyway, I was extremely knowledgable when it came down to one of my favorite pastimes; guns. Everything from field stripping to cleaning to shooting all types.  Today my soul has been re-energized and quenched!! I headed with my boys Tom and Mike ( Collins brothers )to the wonderful state of Pa. We headed to Stoudsberg to a shooting range where Mike has a membership. Yes, This was a slice of heaven on earth to me.   When we get down there we went to the sporting goods store where over 500 guns were stocked against the wall. Over 200 gunns were in the glass cases just ready for the pickng by an upstanding citizen; surely not me. After my penis was hard for over 40 mins; I had to leave.  We stopped by this little diner THAT KICKED EVERY DINER'S ASS IN NYC!!! The breakfast alone was worth the 90 minute drive. We scarfed the food down in a record breaking 19 mins and we were off.  Getting to the range was a bunch of twist and turns of the backroads of redneck country. I was looking for a naked white chic running from a maniac with a chainsaw; sure enough; that didn't happen.  The range was kinda cool. We got there right on time to put up our own targets. The first gun that I tried to shoot was Tom's 45 cal. It had some serious recoil and it took me for a slight loop. I then regressed to Mike's 380. Shooting between the two was hot.   These other kats showed up and they were shooting this 44magnum! That gun grew hair on your chest quick! That fuckin thing was the equivalent to a concentrated batch of viagra in your hands!   We shot for about two hours and I haven't felt that good in years. I ddin't have to worry about cops running after me for shooting at somebody. I shot and shot and shot and had no worries.   I had a great time with those two and they didn't get on my nerves. Afrodeus has quenched his violent bone!

      .......was a waste of my fuckin time. A bunch of Black tie motherfucker that did nothing but speak of how great the Bronx is. Maria Sonia Manzano was sweet though. Grandmaster Flash is still a loser.   Now; It is bad enough that I killed myself for two weeks worried about what was going on in my body. Then  when the blood results get back; I am in picture perfect fuckin health. I despise doctors more then I hate dope fiends.   Check this out:  My Blood pressure two weeks ago was 150/ 100. The worthless medical assistant called it that. Then; the digital machine was hooked up and it was 126/ 82. It took every ounce of energy not to curse that stupid bitch out. The thyroids are fine. I am actually healthy. I am not going to binge out like a starving ethiopian; I am going to maintain healthy eating habits.  I am joining the GYM soon so it's time to kill some folk.  Let me run  Peace

      The definition of "mongo" in the latino slangness is basically weak, soft, fragile.  So last night Mongo affair at summerstage was basically just that; weak. There were some highlights to the show but the lowlights almost overtook the high's. From top to bottom the show was a rollercoaster ride. When I saw Freddy was hosting; I was scared. I was almost praying to God he didn't open the show with....  " I want to eat........ YOUR PUSSY "  His presence was good because he has that deep voice that carries and he sounded good on the mic. The lowest point of the show was this singer from; (sniff, sniff), the Bronx named Erinyes. I am going to kick Algarin just on general principle for saying this chic was from the B.X! Ooooohhhh she was horrid. She was a cross between Roseanne and Rosie Perez belting out some of the worse ballads in the history of summerstage.  Most of the show was ok with Miguel, Emanuel, La Bruja reading a nice collabo. I felt their words forced out of their mouth's at one point( Emanuel and La Bruja ). They still did rather well. Amiri Baraka went up there and I was not impressed. I have my own personal thing against that flake so it will take a while for me to get used to him.   The newly minted " Acentos Street Team " went to work and busted out flyers. I have to love their entusiasm.  After some general stupidity at BBQ's and some gratuitous fat chics dropping plates; Rich drove me home.  It was kind of funny seeing Miguel Algarin up there in front of over a huge crowd. To be honest with you; it seemed there were as much or maybe more people last night as there were at the Nats finals last year.  A whole bunch of white folk enjoying Nuyorican poetry.   Getting over there I passed by a strands book store and picked up " 3 tragedies " by Lorca. the damned book cost me three bucks. You can't go wrong with that.    I am off to the doctor today to get my results of my Blood work. If I don't blog for the next couple of days; leave me alone. I will have some serious personal issues to get used toooooo.  I'm out  Peace  Love  Porkchops  Fish

      Two of my favorite things in the world are in the subject header. Yesterday I had the greatest time performing in Taylor's little reading series for senior citizens. We met up at this little old folk home on 93rd street. I got there a little bit early and the hunger pain kicked in so I headed to go buy a slice of pizza.   The reading started with taylor doing a great cover by Robert Frost to a crowd of 12-15 of the cutest little old folk.  Before you think about it; I didn't flip and scream out " Precision guided bombs are dropping!!!! ". I went laid back with " the Weather " and hit that nostalgic string. The string was a little off-tune but they appreciated it.   Jessica and Oscar were in attendance and they also read and did well. There is something about reading for a small crowd that is very comfortable. These beautiful senior citizens were attentive and they made me feel soooo good.  Taylor has more issues then what I normally thought. I love the guy to death but he almost killed some of the old ladies!!! He has about 20 foam apples that state " Speak with conviction" on them. He gives them out ( well, gingerly throws them )to the audience. He starts a poem in hopes they would throw the apples at him and he can throw them back.  Well, one little old lady threw the apple at Taylor and he proceeds to pick the apple back and LAUNCHES it back at the old lady. Dudes- this lady had to be at least 85 and better and he hit her right in the chest. My mind was running in circles. I was thinking " Taylor, you are going to kill one of these old ladies dude". It was all in fun and they loved it. As Taylor proceeded to tell us this was his test run; no one at any other VENUE better talk shit!! 90 year old ladies held it down and didn't complain.  We finished and headed to eat and had some great conversation involving poetry and some other topics. It was a blur once I got my steak. It was an "ok" steak but I had worse. It was all in the good of poetry so I really can't complain.  The evening was kinda hot as Eric, Tom, Mike, Oscar, Kelly, Lourdes and all met up at City Island for a post post post birthday shindig. We had a great time and laughed sooooooo hard. I acted a fool with my hair and sitting between Lourdes and Kelly both brushing my hair made my sexual fantasies kick in. Before you all get your britches bunched; Kelly and lourdes are a couple.  Good night,   Life is good ,  Peace, love, Porkchops   Fish

      Sometimes life gives you a moment where it forces you to say " life is good". With everything on my back as of late; if I were suicidal; I would have swallowed a " lead Latte " a long time ago.    Yesterday we had probably the best Acentos for me personally. Why you ask?? Not one moment of stress last night. Nothing aggravated me, pissed me off, I didn't think of anything at all. I just enjoyed  a packed open-mic, great hosting, and a feature with huge appreciation for what we do.   As I tried to stretch the evening out; I stood at the Blue Ox until 12ish or so. I am usually one of the first of the organizers to make his exit. I had great conversation with Rich and laughed those deep belly laughs. One of the first dawgs I met on the scene popped up late but he showed. Nocturnal roots showed up with homegirl Inez. I chatted with them for about an hour and it was so good to see them. Even made them see the " Acentos " view of creating poetry for the love and not the slam lure.  Inez seemed to have Met Abena several weeks ago and Abena made such a lasting impression with just her spirit; Inez was floored. rep Louder ABENA!!!!!!!!  I feel great today and I am working on this Fundraiser on the 13th at Acentos. I need to get the crowd to come through. I also want to put together a show that will leave the blue ox gasping for more.  Peace  Short Poem of the day  To her  I kissed the outlines of what used to be the blackened smoke of want tearing my eyes of need breathe labored futures trace good-bye on questions kiss me to life   Fish

      yo; staying home was actually alot of fun dealing with most of these crazy ass people in my life. The conversations ranged from my irritated butthole to the on-going relationship between Diane Roy and I.  It was weird just Im'ing people all day. If I had the ability to IM from work; I wouldn't do shit all day, { not that I do much now}.    Memorable moments  conversation 1 Her: Have you and Diane made nice? Fish: Yea; the make up sex was great. She gives the best head on the scene. (Note: Here is where the rumors start that Diane and I have been fuckin. Meanwhile, the only thing that ever happened was Diane getting drunk and having sex with 12 midgets and I watched; it was awesome!)  conversation 2  Her: How do you feel? Fish: I have about 900 pounds of acid oozing out of my ass every three seconds; I'm peachy  Conversation 3 Him: dude- ****** was actin crazy Fish: I would behead my mother to have a go with her  conversation 4 Her: What did you eat that got you so sick Fish: it wasn't a good piece of ass so I really have no clue  conversation 5 her: swallowing is like swallowing phlegm when you are sick Fish: since you have been sick and swallowed phlegm; get used to it and swallow  conversation 6 Him: My throat hurts a little bit too Fish: Stop sucking dick Him: fuck you Fish: see, stop actin gay and your throat would stop hurting him; you stupid Fish: no, I'm bored  conversation 7 him: you need to get laid Fish: where's your mom? Him; seriously Fish: I'm good; I don't need drama  conversation 8 her: Acentos is tomorrow? Fish: Yep Her: I don't think I can go Fish: Then why ask if you wasn't going?  conversation 9 him; Drink cranberry juice; it's good for your stomach Fish; I hate cranberry juice him: Take some Fish: I hate that stuff him: Drink it anyway Fish: esta bien ( drinks ); this taste like viejo piss  Conversation 10 Her: Have you been writing? Fish; Not too much; I have been really lazy Her: wow Fish: I am performing this Wednesday,  I will get on it soon.  I have been reading alot.  I am back at work and my flow will be back to normal soon. My ass has stopped perculating so that's a good thing.  Acentos tonight  Peace

      .......calling in sick was definitely going to happen.  I am feeling better but still not 100%. I already gave my day off notice to the Bar and also my job. I can't take a chance hosting or working and having to run to this bathroom at lightspeed.   I was ok yesterday; I actually went out and enjoyed the weather for about an hour. The weather was a Godsend on the emotions. It gets trying stuck in the house.  I bumped into a friend of mines that refuses to be identified in the blog.  Due to the possible implications my words could have in court; he was like " don't be writin my name nigger; I can't take no chances". LOL. He kills me.   I have known this dude for a good 20 years already. The last 15 he has been hustling in the streets and has suffered every possible positive and negative aspect of street entrepeneurship. I finally heard the words that I wanted to hear from him, " I want out Fish - I am tired of this shit ". No matter how much money you make these days, you will get tired of it.  We touched on everything from "back in da day" to his Motorcycle that I rocked for about 20 mins up and down Webster.  Something about a GSX 1000 makes you forget everything bad in life. I need to get me a bike really fuckin bad.  Well, let me go try and function to be somewhat constructive today.  Peace

      No, not a bomb strapped to the chest of a confused islamic brother; not an envelope filled with some weird white powder that turned my insides to mush. Well, shit, maybe!!  It is Sunday and I am back to my normal self. I had no clue what the fuck happened to me Friday night and all day saturday but I almost died. I was the victim of food poisioning it seems. If food poisioning is a watery brown juice coming out of your ass about 30 times in an hour; I had it.   It seems the salad I had on Friday for lunch had a great effect on my insides. It hit me hard at about 9pm and it was no joke. I was out and about ready for a great evening and I had to turn around and come back home. To give ya an idea of  how bad it was......  I went through two rolls of paper my asshole is raw to the touch I feel dehydrated   How do girls enjoy anal is beyond me. I was even worried that I wouldn't be able to host Bar 13 tomorrow and maybe miss Acentos. I woke up today without a full sprint to the bathroom so I knew I was getting better.    One thing for sure; I will never eat a salad from that spot by my job ever again. The owner of the establishment is lucky I won't punch him in the face.  Peace      Not

      ........ NOT!!!!!!!!  Last night was the Nerd Slam at the Bowery Poetry club. It was my first trek there in a long time and it felt good to be out on that scene again. This whole hermit thing wasn't my bag of tea.   It was great to see that Shappy did " curate " the shit out of this nerd slam. You can tell he put alot of work into it and I have to give him kudos on that one. With a band playing behind the poets most of the night; orkos? I have no clue, it was kinda vague to me; I was soaking most of my evening in.  Ed Garcia writing right before the slam as only a true nerd does delivered with his unique style [spock ears] and won the honor of being a nerd slam champion. So, this year has Eric Guerreri winning the Limereck slam and Ed the taking the Nerd Slam. Does anyone see a pattern of the louderARTS borg dominating their theme slams?? LOL  Came home last night and had the best night of sleep in such a long fuckin time. It didn't feel stressful, I had great dreams that involved poetry; that is some shit. I woke up well rested and in a great mood. This is how my life should be every friggin day.   Yesterday after I left work I headed to the furniture store with Lenny for she can buy a sofa set for her Mother since her Birthday is coming up. I am shopping for a wall unit for the condo and I saw one for 900 beans. My man had another one closely resembling the one I liked for 375 but the first one is bangin. It is going to make that empty wall look superb.  If you read closely, yes I spent time with Lenny and I had a great time bothering her. Just jokin and actin a fool and trying to guess the color of her panties since she didn't want to tell me.  I know they were black but she won't confirm nor deny this. DEM SHITS WERE BLACK CARAJO! Great time, no stress.   Tonight I am headed to the Nuyo and I will either sac goat or be the break poet.  Most likely I will hit break poet. Since my man dickboy is going to go with some of my other people's; I am not trying to sac to a 19.5. LOL.   The weekend looks good as I will clean Pablo's (my turtle) tank tomorrow. I will definitely try to catch a movie; any takers to run with me Saturday during the day???? It's free and I'll pick ya up.  Have a great weekend for all you Monday internet stalkers.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

      ........that will never be forgotten:   After seeing Detroit Spank the Lakers; one certain dude was screaming his head off like he struck lotto. After my nerves getting touched and I tell him " Dude, relax, it's just a game, you are not even a detroit fan and you are screaming crazy"  This other cat says " I scream like that when I cum ". I thought I was going to die.   Definite surreal moment.  I feel good today. Most of the Latino borg sprinkled with some whiteness met up at the Blue Ox to see the Lakers lose. Sure enough; Benedict Arnold Malone was on the bench to witness the championship slip away. :) Oh, and for all you NY/ Laker fan... Fuck ya too. You live in NY and you root for a west coast team?, I am glad the lakers lost.   I feel really good today and I think I found the right mix of what to eat to maintain some energy. Going on a diet is kinda harsh on the body when it is screaming for what it is used too.   This Friday I am headed over to the NUYO to catch some poetry. My friend Dickboy is suppose to head out their with his girl so I might try to perform.  Peace

      it is weird how when someone tells you you have something; you have all those signs and symptons.  I had a great time last night as we all pulled a rabbit our of our prospective asses at Bar 13. The Crowd was light and we still managed to have the theme slam.  The  urlLink sorta rican  said it himself last night:  " It is easy to host the nuyorican when you have 300 people jumping on your every word"  Man, try hosting a room with about 15 people and ten of them being your friends! I had a great time being a jackass and we pulled it off quite nicely. One thing for sure; Acentos will take over before you know it. I hate when the crowds are light and we need to get people at that bar  I feel good today. I was really tired last night and I went straight home. It was hard as hell not to go to RES and munch out.  I have to maintain a promise to myself that I will not eat past 6pm. those late night dinners is what probably got my pressure going through the roof. Also, record this in your brain; I no longer drink pepsi. It has been 7 days and I think I am finally over it. The first 4 days were crazy as my body was craving that caffeine. Once I kick the vices; the diet comes on strong and I get my ass back to the gym. No bulk this time; it's all about reps and cardio. I want to get down to 200 by years end.   Everything has to changed.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      .....bloggin on Mondays. Most people read my wekend entries and they are quenched!  I didn't write about this last week after getting caught up with my new obstacles in life. I had an aunt in Puerto Rico kick the bucket last week.   This was my fathers Mothers Sister. Making her some type of family member. This lady brought new meaning to extravagant. She was one of the first people in Puerto Rico to strike it rich in some sorts. She had about 40 acres of land in which sugar cane ran supreme. After that went to shit; she sold it to some developers and before you know it; el centro was born. That was the story my dad told me and for some reson I think he embellished a little. I do know that the old lady was rolling in money and she spent her days traveling and seeing the world.  To my knowledge she sold her land but got a pretty stipend from each bit of land sold. So she was set for life; life ended for her last Tuesday.   After some travel with the Latino-American Legion, she complained of pains in her arm. She went to the hospital and the arm pain became chest pain. The chest pain became a full fledged heart attack. All that money couldn't save her.   My father wanted to send some roses to the funeral but I had to remind him how she completely seperated herself from the family and felt it a need to become a " traveling hermit".  For some reason she awlays thought the family was after her money. I never understood that because the Famila Vargas has always been well off.    Of course the first thing out of my mouth was who was going to get all her land and money when my dad told me. A piece of me expected my dad to get at least and acre or two added on to what he already has in Puerto Rico. Sure enough, the American Legion is getting every red cent of hers in the bank, all her land, all her property, even her horses and cows.   Her husband fought in WWII and they have always taken care of her after he died during the D- Day invasion. According to her; he was some type of hero who fought to his very last breathe. According to my grandmother (R.I.P abuelita), he never got off the boat.   Regardless, Tiva (my aunt) lived a full life and did her thing.   Fish

      ..........for this post for a minute! Feast your eyes on the ever definite boricua post after engaging in some jackassery at the Puerto Rican day Parade!  Yes, I am 33 years old and my old ass threw on the ghetto gear and headed to ì el Defile ì. Egad it hasnít changed a bit. Speaking ìmatter of factlyî; it has readily gotten worse. I wasnít completely full of enthusiasm to wake up early and head to what I hate most; crowds.   A friend of mine hasnít graced the parade route of rowdy Boricuas in several years. When she asked me if I was going I was hesitant but with good company- I was there. Fortunately, Eric called me and I guilted him into heading out here with me.   After meeting Eric and taking a non-eventful stroll to 51 st and 6th; things just went into motion.  Historically the parade has been a feast of beautiful women eagerly awaiting catcalls from desperate men seeking redemption through one last ìhook-upî. k, maybe that is pushing it but the parade has always been through the roof with the hottest women strutting up and down fifth ave. In the past several years we have witnessed some seriously barbaric behavior. Men throwing water on women, grabbing them,  sexually assaulting them.  Then the police presence has gone to a new level- Central park is closed, barricades are all over, under-cover cops harassing every alcohol drinking person between 44th and 86th street. Welcome to the world of over an estimated 3 million latinos invading 5th ave.  This year was probably the worst year of the parade in my experience. Regardless of the great company I was in; the parade was still commercial, the girls were an issue onto themselves, men were bordering between "pigs" and "maggots".  Letís break this down into designated areas  - The company we keep ñ  I met a friend of mines that is actually extremely attractive to many of the normal men out there.  I knew it was going to be one of those days in which the whistling, thrown kisses, cat calls were going to be heavy.   I counted;  27 ì Rubiasî 17 ì mamiî 5 ì yo babyî  looks???? Wow, almost every single man that passed her gawked. The situation was interesting and I think she handled herself with grace. The endless comments didnít phase me and luckily not one drunken baffoon decided to lay a hand on her. I firmly believe once you touch; all bets are off.  - They all have defined the words perfectly-  This might be long. Since the women were plentiful; of course I was going to look. As respectful as I was to my company, it was hard not to see the winners of the day. The winners are not exactly what you are thinking.  The winners were the exposed stomachs of 200 pound behemoths, the short skirts revealing butt cheeks, The see through shits exposing bras that are too small.  Holy shit, what the fuck are half of these girls thinking of?  I left the parade and I was thinking; ì more then 90% of the women at that parade were chickenheadsî. It was scary at what some of these girls thought was ì stylish and trendsettingî.  the guys donít stay far behind. Every guy was dresssssed straight out of a Jay ñZ video. If the cops put an APB on the guy with the white shirt; 98 percent of the men would get locked up.  *********************************  It was an interesting day today as I saw much more then what I bargained for and didnít see enough of what I hoped for.  Sometimes I wonder why people get upset when they get stereotyped. Well, don't perpetuate the myth and you will be ok. It was bad out there to see men actin like fools and women tolerating it. Women walking more like overweight strippers and not having a classy care in the world.   tell ya this, it was bad.  Boricua everyday except tday

      ......I walked home from the doctor to kinda clear my head.  I have to take some steps in ensuring that I will be around for a while instead of kicking the bucket even before I get published.  It was cool taking a nice long walk by myself. The walk took exactly 2 hours.  It is really crazy the shit you see when you are walking through places your car can't get through.  - around white plains an older white lady was screaming into her cell phone inquiring the whereabouts of her son.     " I want to know where the fuck is my son!! I have been waiting out here for over an hour and my son didn't get off the fucking bus!! I don't want to go down there because I will go to fucking jail. I am going to transfer my son out of that school becaue all you have if fucking niggers!"  Yep, ignorance lives in the Bronx  - Passing by Mosholu parkway over the Bronx River Creek; a young couple throwing rocks into the water. It looked like an episode out of Dawson's creek  - Cutting through Bronx River Park East park; a couple of young domincans playing baseball. They sucked too. At least they were practicing  - Passing through Frenchy Charles Playground; a whole bunch of girls with carriages. This is the hangout for all the hot single chics with kids!  - 207th and webster; little kids playing with dog hair from a freshly groom poodle that didn't look too happy.  The bronx is just a little bit brighter. It is also a littl bit weirder.  Fish

Yep folks; I am now one of the 5 million Americans with hypothyroidism. A major slowing down of the output of glands from the tyroids. Another obstacle added in my life. I was the picture perfect example of health when I was doing dirt and banging hard in the street. I find poetry and decide to live this righteous life; this shit pops up!

      .....are going to mean the death of me. Last night I got home after a good night at Acentos. I was happy and I crept into bed early to get some good sleep. Somewhere between poetry and the Da Vinci code; my sub-conscious is buggin the fuck out!  I am dreaming that I am at the new place and my desk is right under the skylight. First off; I don't have a skylight and that got me pissed. Ok, I walk in and someone is throwing rocks through the skylights. I see them coming and they get bigger and bigger. With a weird order of the rocks coming through; I head to the roof to see who is throwing these rocks. I see about 25 people across the other roof. They are dressed in Napoleonic garb with the funky hats and all. The head Napoleon starts shouting that I have twenty minutes to exit before he comes in to " take over ". I see the rest of this spontaneous "army" pull out swords and you can tell they are waiting for the words to attack.   I come back down and I am genuinely scared so I called " 911 ", A cop comes to my door and I take him to the roof to show him Napoleon who is about to attack me. Behold, he is gone and there were no signs of anyone on the roof. I immediately start thinking of ghost and that shit freaked me out. I woke up and here I am thinking; " Why am I dreaming about ghost ?" Napoleon ghost at that !  ah fuggit.  Peace, Love, Pasteles  Fish

      ....... Rich Villar walks out of the Acentos Corral and leaves bodies riddled with holes behind him. That is the closest I can put the evening in order.   Tonight was a different night with some obstacles in the way of making my night of hosting a smooth one. overcome and adapt; thank you Clint Eastwood in that movie in which the name is escaping me.  A good night with a standing room only crowd. Singers, rappers, poets, and readers all came to the mic and completely killed it. The night was just straight up hot.   Rich got up there with Mom and pop in the audience and delivered an incredibe set.  It touched on the blue, the bright, the love, the humor that makes Rich a special fuckin dude.  When I featured back in Nov and he had the balls to say I was his hero.....  Hermanito, Put on some blue tights and a red cape. You are my super hero. I am going to cal you........  " PERNIL MAN"  Peace

      ...... to be a fuckin host. Last night was a good night but it was hard. I was drawing some serious blanks last night. I guess it was the first slam hosting jitters. I never hosted a slam and I think it showed. Well, at least I got balls to get up there. After some practice; I will get better. Any input for those poetry host out there??? Then again, that is me! LOL  I feel good today. Got some good rest and that is always a good thing. Tonight is another hosting jaunt at Acentos where Rich is about to show some love to the Microphone for about 30 mins. It's his time to shine and I can't wait to see what he comes out with.   Well, let me have some fun......  an ex-girlfriend of mines happened to come upon my blog and it seems that she reads it religiously. I was with this girl uhh........ 14 years ago. I have always maintained a friendship with almost every girl that has played an integral part in my life. I remember the first day I met her- it was insane.   I went to her high school to a dance that my man Wil was going to to meet a girl he was trying to get with at the time. We met up with them and we were just outside of this Gym chillin and talking shit. Emely was sitting on a desk and wil said something to her and she was like " I wil fuck you up Wil". She got up from desk and she kept on growing. I told Wil ' Yo, you on your own". This chick was about 6 ft even. I looked at her my my mouth dropped.   After some general stoooopidity going back and forth we walked Emily home. I wasn't sure if she was feeling me but I was kinda feeling her. Those days weren't the days of pagers, cell phones nor e-mail. It was all about the house number. I almost walked away from her and didn't give her my number. She asked me for the number and I was like " Yea, that would be a good idea ". I should have takin this as a sign of how crazy this chic is!! LOL  Nah..... we spent alot of time on the phone. We joked and she was probably the first recorded case of " Fish writing a poem for a girl". I gave her a nickname of " My Princess ".  We spent alot of time together when we had the chance. I started working and she used to come visit me in my job. I think things started going sour when I hit that confused stage in my life.  I am still currently going throigh it.  At the time I was also talking to my other ex Fatima. It was hard for me to feel something emotionally for two different females. So, I made the logical choice and broke it off with Emily.   Funny how I reflect 14 years later and I realized the huge mistake I made. Fatima fucked up on me big time. I should have stood with emily and I know for a fact we would have gotten married. She loved me that much. Maybe speaking from hindsight; I would have fell in love with her just as hard. I guess we will never know.  One thing for sure; when Emely and I got together the sex was pretty crazy. For two young kids with no clue on what they were doing; we thought we were porno stars. LOL  I think the funniest thing to ever happen to us was in her house. Wil was in the living room with Ivette and I was in the bedroom with Emely. Ivette never wanted to give Wil ass but he was always all up in there; get my point? So I come out of the bedroom after rocking some Keith Sweat " make it last Forever " and I walk to the living room. Will gets up and says " Yo Fish, Smell my fingers". I look at him with this look and I am like " nigga, Smell mines ". We cracked up as only we do and it was one of those moments we could never forget.  Over the years Emely and I have gotten together as friends, lovers, butt buddies, and everything else under the sun. I usually cut her off years at a time when she fucks up on me. She pormised to come to my uppercase and I didn't speak to her for about 2 years.    She recently just got married and I am happy for her. She got married and her last name is Pinero. The same last name one of my all time favorite poets! Ironic in my book.  Oh, when it comes to the oral department; " Emely, you are about 7 in my book" I am sorry but I have had some girls that know these tricks with their tongues that are certainly toe curling!  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

         A quick requested overview about the Sopranos. I wasn't much of a fan this year. The show bordered more on an afternoon soap opera then a prime time dig into a mafia family. Then again; all this is just what I am entitled too; a fuckin opinion.  Yesterday's episode set the precedent for next year. It will most likely come back on a high-note. The NY family will not go to war with the NJ clan due to a Fed pinch ( Gotta love that Taxpayer money ). Interesting was Tony smoking his own cousin to put at ease the dissention in the ranks from his own crew.  In order for the spaghetti eating bat wielders to head over to NY to bash some heads; they needed Tony's ok. He wasn't giving that to avoid throwing his family in an all out war with NY. Since it was his own cousin that planted the seeds to nurture this war; Tony was the one that wanted to take him out. His cousin was a fuckin massaging knucklehead anyway.  After some mafia tactics to track the cousin down; Tony comes from the shadows and pops him point blank with a shotty. Been there, seen that; it's not that neat.   Tony will go through some serious guilt sessions. Dr Melfi will have to prescribe him some valium chasers after the prozac.  The guilt he felt after his cousin did over 15 years in jail and never said a word. He owed his cousin and he delivered by giving him a gambling operation. He gets paid back with his cousin going into business for himself as a Hack hitman. Talk about being the very cause of your own death.  Johnny Sack which is the boss of the NY family lives in Jersey. That is kinda ironic if you think about it. A N.Y boss in the Back yard of a N.J boss. When Johnny Sack and Tony S seem to have struck a deal; the feds come down! This fat bastid NJ boss runs through the back woods of Jersey to his house. On the real; David Chase ( Writer of the Sopranos ), Don't make James Gandolfini run like that, he is going to charge you for every step he takes through the woods.   James: " I have to run??? Oh that is going to cost you extra."  This season was really a deep trek into the minds of the soprano clique. It made ya understand the decisions they all made. Even when Adriana was smoked about two episodes ago; Christopher made so much sense.  Chrissy: She was willing to rat me out instead of doing five years?? I thought that cunt loved me "?  Tony S has issues with his crew and with his family. None of those can compare to the shit that he deals with within his own head.   When we hear on the news about mafia related activities; we never think of the behind the scenes. Gotti had a wife, Carlo Gambino had kids, Gigante had a Priest brother, They all are trying to put food on the table just like the rest of us.  I wonder if the mafia will ever try to infiltrate the poetry world. Well, we had Guerriri and he went into the witness protection program in FT Collins Colorado! Heard about the Tank he flipped in??   ERic: THE POETRY HERE IS SOOOOOO BAD!!!!  Peace

      ...... I was still a knucklehead! Picture this; A dewalt drill with a 3/4 inch attachment socket at the end; somebody elses Galant in silver; 20 seconds and I have readily replaced my broken gaslid.  I just came from the dealer and what pisses me off is this; The GAS LID DOESN'T COME PAINTED!!!!! That shit is not cool!  Gas lid - 30 bucks Auto Body Paint - 50 bucks Labor - 20 bucks  This fuckin bites. If the Galant was a piece of shit from 1980; you damned real I would be driving around sans the gas lid.   X'ibit - PLEASE PIMP MY RIDE!!!!  FISH FLAKES  - On other fronts, Lakers were shocked by the pistons. Yeah baby: fuck Karl Malone.  - They found a body stuffed in a trunk on 13th street yesterday. Any poets missing that thought yesterday was Monday?  - Oscar De La Hoya fought like a piece of shit. Bernard Hopkins wasn't much better.  They should meet this september and it is going to be about 1 hour wasted of my life.  - I feel like setting up a paintball trip. I wonder which poets have balls.  People who I think would go paintballin:  Bonafide Fish Oscar Guy Juan Eliel M.C Rich  People who would dare step foot on that field:  Everyone else  Ya gots balls; bring it  - Is kidnapping a dead president against the law?? He is dead so it doesn't matter since he won't know it. I would take pictures of a naked Ron getting butt fucked. That would be some internet worthy material.  - Sopranos ended pretty deep. If you watched it, the guilt TONY S is going to go through for killin his cousin when the whole NY crew was pinched is going to give Tony Nightmares. Looking forward to the next and final season in 18 months.  - I am going to see a doctor this Thursday about my head. Seems I might have some issues that came back with a vengence.  Peace, Love, Porkchops

"Yo Ronny; you might be dead and that is not such a good thing. I am hearing every right wing conservative brown noser calling you the greatest President of our time. Well, In a time where the Bronx was burning and the National deficit tripled under your watch; fuck you. Reaganomics is finally dead in my eyes. "  I know I know, " That is mean Fish, he died ". Well, Let me check my conscious really quick. Uh......... nope, don't care   Fish

      ........ when the fuck you bringin dem kats home.  "Five U.S. soldiers were killed today and five others wounded when an explosion ripped through a Humvee in eastern Baghdad, a U.S. military spokesman said. The deaths bring the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq to 825 since the war began, including 605 in combat."   urlLink This  is all bullshit.  I was talking to a friend of mines yesterday and we hit the voting subject. She used a metaphor for putting people in the white house that blew me away.   Fish: So the reason you don't vote is........ her: I can't vote when my only choices are putting cancer or AIDS in the white house to run this country.   I can't call dubya a cancer. I could consider him a form of flesh eating bacteria. A fuckin e-coli bacteria which is eating away at the United States. So far the first appendage has fully rotted away; Tenet.      urlLink 825!!

      .....the fish is here, the Fish is here.  It gets kinda stressful when you go home and you have absolutely nothing to write about when you get to work the next day. To my loyal insurgents; I still give you some mental rantings.  This morning I got up and threw on the gratuitous cable; 6 years going strong; and I catch  urlLink Stand and Deliver  with Edward James Olmos. This was always a sensitive flick for me. It runs side by side to how most of my people's grew up. I start thinking about my most influential teachers in my 18 years of school.   Kindergarden - Ms Rimple 1st Grade - Ms Wainwright 2nd grade - Ms Koslow 3rd grade - Ms Finnegan 4th grade - Ms Kimtis 5th grade - Ms Brau 6th grade - Ms Steinberg  6th grade in texas - Ms Montegomery  Junir High School in Texas ( Lamar JHS )  7th grade  Math - Ms Portillo English - Ms  History - Mr Ortega Phy Ed - Mr Lamont Spanish - Ms Lupilla Band - Mr Thornebush  Back to NYC ( JHS 123 8th Grade Science - Mr White English - Mr Bello History -  Art - Ms Woodrow   That is all I remember; that is sad.  JHS 123 was a fuckin blur as my time spent in class was only matched to my time spent running in the  hallway playing round-up.   I was incredibly bad in the 4th grade and in JHS. In the 4th grade was my rebellious stage. The teacher considered me so bad she had to place my desk in front of the class. I spent the whole school year right under the chalkboard. THat could explain my hatred towards chalk dust. When my mother came in one time to give me the keys  because she was called into work; the teacher sandblasted me over glass and hot coals. Every word out of the teachers mouth was....  " Your son is the worst behaved in the class " " He doesn't respect me " " he doesnt do his work "  My mother ran straight to my desk and beat me in front of the whole class. The teacher didn't know what to do. Those white teachers think latin kids get a verbally stinging reprimand; no; we get our ass beat.  I cried and stood there. The teacher put her hands on my shoulder and I didn't say one word for months.  here was the teachers dilema now:  I never did my work I never gave in homework I never participated in her class  I aced every single test she gave  Math - never lower then a 90 English - never lower then a 90 Spelling - hundreds almost everytime Quizes weren't even an issue.  I was a rebel every single day. Even when we were suppose to write in script; I wrote in print. The teacher gave up on me. Wanna laugh?? Until this day, I can't write in script! LOL  How could she fail me? I was there every day and passed every test she gave; I just never did her work. Well, in her class I never did shit. At home I didn't even give my mother the satisfaction of seeing me reading books. I just watched TV and spent my time drawing. How I never became an artist was beyond me. My room was always filled with drawings and sketches. It was a talent that never prospered no matter how much I practiced. Yet, I drew letters in their own form. The spelling words we were supposed to practice were hidden behind the buildings I drew.    After passing the citywides, I passed the 4th grade. I never liked that teacher and she was one of the first people who I wished death upon. Guess what??? MY mother was never far behind. After that; my mother was on my shit list until I was 28. I never disrespected my mother but we never got along. My father was the typical absentee parental figure most of my life. He was the 6pm pop. I woould see him at 6pm when he got home. I should have nicknamed him the M & M pop. He would bring home M&M candy every time he walked through that door. Them shits were the bomba.  My favorite teacher of all time was Ms Wainwright. My first grade teacher that always made me and every other kid in her class special. She must be old now if not dead. She was the typical black teacher with that special kind of hug for all the kids that did well.  Shit, a teacher hugs a kid today and get ready for the media to record your perp walk out of the local precint.   My worst year was my attempted acclamation to the 6th grade in texas. I fought every single day. I tried to do my work but everything I did was wrong. It was a hell living in probably the most racist state in America. I know for a fact if I would have stood living in Texas; I would have been on death row.    my first day in that school I fought the school bully in the bathroom and beat his ass. Instead of me getting the props; I was despised by every race of white, black, mexicans. I was the new lone wolf vying for power. Instead, I was the alpha male of my own cru that consisted of another half white and mexican, a black and latino and me; the Puerto Rican. We were the mutts of Benjamin Milam elementary.   That was such a long time ago   Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      ....... should be shot!  Oh my God he sucks some serious geriatric ass! Eric and I walked into the stadium and it was the Orioles leading 1 to nothing. What the fuck???  After sitting and looking at my surroundings and being dumbfounded; I settled in. Hit, walk, hit, walk and it's the Orioles up 5-0. Did I mention this was all in the top of the first? The first fuckin inning!!!!!!!!  I had a great time yesterday. All the poet borg showed up except for Oscar who got caught up at work.  Actin like total fools we just yelled, shouted and had a good time. Upsetting was when they started the fuckin wave! That is some loser Shea Stadium Met fan shit. Meanwhile, Bonafide and I just sat down while Eric ( asshole that he is sometimes ) was counting to start the wave. I have totally rescinded his Yankee card; Shea stadium awaits your arrival.  The chants we started were fun. You can't go wrong with:  " Let's go Yankees " " Box Seats Suck " " Boston Sucks " " 5 Dollar Tickets "   The Yankees were losing but Sheffield Homered, Jeter Homered, Matsui RBI'ed. When the smoke was over; the Yankees came back to win the Game 6-5. Ahhhhh........the sweet smell of Victory. The song that makes you a true New Yorker:   Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today I want to be a part of it - New York, New York These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray Right through the very heart of it - New York, New York  I want to wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep And find I'm king of the hill - top of the heap  These little town blues, are melting away I'm gonna make a brand new start of it - in old New York If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere It's up to you - New York, New York      I love ol Blue eyes and his gangsta affiliations.  Going to the usual diner to eat and act a fool; I was totally overwhelmed with Eliel on one side and Tom on the other. IF you haven't hung out with Tom; well: he's different. He can be just slightly revolting in some ways but he's a nice guy once all his stories of porn, killing, windpipe crushing, jizz, and bee vomit all said and accounted for. Shit, that sounds like a night out with me.  Besides that, we had a great time. We bugged out and had a great time. One thing for sure; the women at Yankee Stadium were crazy. I never have seen so many beautiful white women to catch a sports event. I don't know what they are doing in the Bronx but I need some duct tape really bad!

      ........Blowjob! Yes, I am back. A dirty minded pervert talking about sex, lovemaking, fuckin, and midgets.    Like if none of you have ever thought of fuckin a midget! Not a short chic or dude; a bonafide little person. I was doing my usual surfing of the internet and hit some sites that dealt with midget porn. There isn't much of it but the one's that do exist tend to be hilarious. Let me explain the thought process of many dirty men in your midst;  they do not want to fuck a midget; they merely want to stand up and have the midget standing in front of them worshipping the love wand. Oh, as most of you sick bastids are most likely normal to average size in penis length and girth; don't front; the magic stick would look gigantic in the hands of a midget!!  I have gotten some crazy e-mails from people surfing my other blog. That is the one where the sex talk goes unchecked. I have one religious reader that takes hints and pointers from what I write over there. I have no clue why people are so enamored with sex talk.  It's all something that we talk about; maybe some not as candid as I.   The topics can be broken down in several categories;  Best sex Worst sex Quickest sex longest sex hottest sex Weirdest sex Craziest sex   I strongly encourage you to think of what is "morally repugnant" to " Side splittingly hilarious "  Ask yourself these questions:  - Why did I fuck that person? - Oh God was I that drunk ? - I wonder if they are busy tonight? - Why did I leave her?? She did anal!! - Why did I leave him??? He likes it in HIS ass! - Why oh why did I let him cum on my face? - Why not a threesome with my mother???   Ok ok ok ........the last one is pushing but shit happens!!  Forgive me as I am pushing the envelope today.  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish

      ......... is energetic; life is easier.   Last night was my first hosting duty in a minute. It was the uppercase land of new voices coming to the mic and saying " I am fucking here " I was  hoping to have hundreds of people at Bar 13 but I will settle for just a few.   I still had a great time and kept the evening moving right along. A good host is important but I firmly believe the night belongs to the people.  The past two uppercases have been just that; their night. I still am miffed over how my uppercase was fucking shot to shit with an aweful manangement decision. I hold no ill will but I have the right to be miffed so fuck everybody.  I can't even be happier for the three yahoo's that featured last night. Maria, Matt, and Jessica rocked out last night. They all brought it to the table and slammed it down.  Afterwards was the usual stupidity at res. It was higher then usual as some fucking paper throwing started going back and forth. I know we can act a fool but throwing paper is pushing the envelope. I can't take people no where.   Funny was going home and Eliel grew some balls and asked me to drop him off anywhere in the Bronx. He is luck I didn't take his ass to the Yonkers border.  I dropped him off at Westchester and Whitlock; I hope he didn't get mugged.  My Fish Tanks are beautiful as I cleaned them within an inch of their life. In previous post; I did swallow some Fish water; I almost died.   Good night and everything is cool.

      I have written three blog entries and all of them end with " Saying Good-bye"  I have deliberated ending my blog run for a while. I have caught myself writing less and less poetry and in my private journal as I have gotten my "fill" on here.   Instead of making a point to blog I am going to change up these priorities and shift my energies.  So...... it's not good bye; it's more like an official quasi-hiatus.  it's kinda weird  Peace   Fish  Faranheit 9/11 tonight, Old San juan tomorrow, la playa Saturday, y el barrio Sunday evening.

      If my day will be fortold by the early morning events in my trek to the job; I'm fucked.  It is serious when I am walking in this rain and I step on what I thought was a clump of leaves and it turns out to be a dead sparrow. After hearing the crunch of the little birdbones, I look down and his little intestines came out of his ass.   Fish weighing in at 240 pounds  -VS-  Sparrow weighing in at 9 ounces  Fish wins but he is going straight to hell.  Everything is cool with me today. I feel some what antsy as I woke up thinking about some of my past relationships and friendships going to shit in 2004.  So far I have lost three friends for varying reasons this year.  I am anti social sometimes because once I make a friend, I like to keep them. Especially after several years of talking, loving, and being a shoulder.  Last week a good friend was hurt after I made it clear that I would not be ready for a relationship with her; not now and maybe ever. Seems that she was holding out with some hope. She figures down the road we would have been perfect being friends first and then becoming more. I always knew she wanted more but I always turned a blind eye to it. Even though a decision was made for us to still remain good friends, I know it will be different.   Relationships are the very thing that makes me go round and sometimes stops me dead in my tracks. Seems that all around me most of the rock solid relationships have gone to shit and it hurts. Man, it even fuckin terrifies me of getting together with someone. That love shit is a bitch.   Lately  I have cuaght myself tearing away from my typical " The world is fucked up " type of poetry. I have written three love poems in a span of a week. Granted I think their shitty but it is a new ground that I have never broken.  At one point I bash love over the head with a sledgehammer. Then I hold it and cry why I killed love.   It's one of those things that you are scared to death of it but you want it.  I live a very good life and many would kill to be in my situation.  I have a nice apartment in a good area, bills are paid, car is good, money in the pocket. I live alone and I am never stressed in my palatial penthouse on Perry Ave. Then I see there is something missing and I spiral directly to a shithole named depression. Not clinically but enough for me to be upset and pick up a pen and write. I am not ready to give it up yet but if I don't, I doubt I will commit fully to that love bug. See the dilema?  I'm out  Peace, Love, Porkchops  Fish  10:01am

      Why am I so ga-ga over women in whit pants?? OH MY GOD!!!  The spic-nic was a success if I may over-step my boundaries and say so. I invited the pale folk to come down and offset the colors of this so-called picnic ala spic-nic ala general jackassery  I do have to say that I had a great time. We ate plenty of chicken and salad that Nina slaved over. Pobre muchacha was sooo stressed and everything came out fine. After a little trek to waste my time at teachers and writers we came back and enjoyed the rest of an awesome evening. We hit the cards and played some good hands of poker. The dominoes were chipping off the table with Jess dancing over the table; that girl has issues.  Maria showed up with a huge vat of " ensalada guineo ", you can't go wrong.  Oscar Slept, Chance avoided the columbian festival in Queens, Eric made people laugh, Rich was Pedro Guananaba, Tom was snake Man, Mike was mike, Racheal was cute( Mike you lucked out), Juan Carlos was the token immigrant, Diane is a poker junkie, Duffy was DIAT, Raj was raj,  Maria and Bill need to have kids, M.C siegel was with Hat....again, Nina was gracious. And too many more to remember  The interesting tidbit of the day/night was the explosion of someone's insides in the men's bathroom. Me personally, the worst conditioned bathroom I have ever seen was in the bullpens ( central booking ) in the Bronx. It was covered with piss, shit, vomit, blood, and other bodily fluids.  This men's room in the park yesterday was worse then that. Picture you go into the stall and see splattered shit all behind the toilet. It looks like some swallowed some gunpowder with a nitroglycerin chaser. They ran to the bathroom when nature called and pulled down their pants and their ass exploded with such force it left a three foot splatter behind the toilet. It had to be the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.  The surreal moment was Maria's boyfriend playing this flute thing and a squirrel coming down and staying there for about 10 minutes watching him play. The squirrel was completely orgasmic. I love Maria's boyfriend to death but I would have killed to see that squirrel jump on his face and start humping away.  This has been a good summer so far. Yesterday was a relaxing day and no drama what so ever popped off.  The tight knit group of poets can actually hang out and not talk about poetry. They have excelled through that poetry community and have become friends. That is cool in my book  I was kinda sad that more people didn't come out to enjoy this spic-nic. I understand the circumstances of babysitting, previous plans, new beaus, and just the errant need to just do something with other people. I am guilty of that more then anyone else on this scene.   I am organizing a huge BBQ at a park to be determined. I want to see who is coming out with the excuses now.  This will be a huge production of food and grilling and some serious stupid shit popping off.  I tentatively wanted the BBQ for July 25 but that is toooo close. I plan on doing it after Nats. August 15th which is a Sunday seems to be the best day for getting together.    No excuses, no bullshit, Bring food, bring rum, bring condoms  Peace, Love, Porkchops  What???? Condoms make great water balloons  Fish   10:08

      The day goes well when you have nothing to worry about sometimes. After a rather constructive day of shopping at Home depot; Eric came to pick me up at the condo with spontaneous plans in tow. We decided to go eat at City Island. Our stomachs led us to the famed  Tito Puente's Seafood SHITHOUSE! Oh god the food was sooooo bad. Mind ya, I've had worse but this food had miles to go before it hit the near edible plateau. To top it all off the shit was kinda pricey.   The best part of the restaurant experience was relishing in the neighboring beauty of a party of at least 20 of the most gorgeous white chics I have ever seen. It had to be some model party because they all wee tall and hot!!! :)  Another great part was leaving the parking lot and these three puerto rican chics were looking at Eric and I like we were about to be served up on a Cannoli platter. A few smiles and polite pleasantries and we were off to catch a movie. Heehee........ Fish still got it!  We caught the new bomba of 2004; Anchorman. THis movie was sooooo bad. It had it's moments but for the general feel of this flick - it was bad. Several cameo appearances might have made me laugh but all in all the movie sucked. Spiderman 2 will keep it reign it seems.  Since today is the infamous SPic-Nic;  I had to gather some soda and plates for Nina just to makes sure she has something. I met up with her very quickly last night and dropped over 2 cases of soda with plates and and forks. With me taking my cooler packed with ice, everything should be enough.  It was a good day yesterday as Eric and I were hopped up on jackassery pills known as " general stupidity". It was one of those days that we laughed at everything known to man. We called Oscar up about 9 times and left long ass messages just to show him some love. It was funny to us.   Spic-nic time  if you read this and you want to meet us out there; cal a nigga  917-209-4211  Peace  Love  Porkchops  Fish  10:35am

      so yesterday the new timberlands were put on the feet. The new shorts with a new Ghetto t-shirt and the hair was slicked back into a pony tail and I was off to the races.   I caught a movie last night and I had a pretty good time. As my joke for the evening was.......  " So, are you going to jump on me?. I brought this new Axe Body spray and according to the commercial, you are supposed to jump on me with this errant need to fuck me"  Well, she politely declined to fuck me but she did say I smelled good. Seems that I will sue someone for false advertisement as soon as I finish these 5 cans I picked up yesterday for 5 bucks on my old block.   I am pulling out all the stunts in my vain attempts to get laid. LOL  I am even thinking about getting.......... a haircut! LOL  nahhhhh...........  funny ass post but I am actually good. The hair is staying and I am happy with my porn  Oh, if you are wondering who I wanted to fuck me; it was more like askin your sister for a blowjob.  Peace   11:13

      You ever thought over the years how many secretary's have been getting their groove on with their bosses??? I say we poll and create a percentage based graph on the matter.  This morning I was watching this movie with James Spader called " Secretary". It was funny to me at how some bosses use that power trip to get over.  " there are eraser shavings on your desk; bend over "  " You were late 23 seconds, please swallow today "  " You looked at me while I was looking at you, today is anal day"  I am not saying every single secretary is fuckin their boss but let's be real folks, some of them have to be sucking the he-whistle during lunch. Don't get it twisted neither, I am not being gender biased. Some of those male secretaries have to be tube steaking all day long!  Boss or no boss you do have to love those during the day booty calls in the office. Can you even fathom the fact you have someone to come over and give the quickest but yet most erotic fuckin of your day? Awwwwww .........the good life.   Would I fuck a secretary if I had one??? Well, it depends if he doesn't mind me taking his temperture rectally!  LOL  Yep  One of those days!  heehee  Peace  Love  Porkchops  5:48am

      When you go somewhere expecting the world to bow at your feet but you get a friendly pat on your ass and sent on your way; shit is anti-climatic!  Yesterday was a pretty good day after work. I headed over to Bronx Community College to perform in Jessica's class to give the young chitlins a taste of performance poetry. During the writing exercise I was bored and hot and assissted some of the rug rats. Some of them had some pretty decent work considering they all wanted to run out of the door.   I performed three quick pieces with Rich ( my newly minted partner and lover ) going right after me. I call him that because I introduced him as Rich Villar; my partner and lover. Yep, my streak at shocking people remains intact.  After some general poetry talk and questions from the students, we were off the attack the remainder of the day.   As Jess didn't even think about fighting me for the front seat, we got some pizza at my favorite spot and we munched hardcore. After some general ogling at this fat chic with the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen, we had to go to Hostos for.......  Oscar's BRIO award ceremony. That shit rocked for the 20 mins that it was. I was pretty happy for Oscar as he pulled out all the stunts with the "come fuck me" gear.   My surreal moment of the night was one of the BRIO award winners for poetry came to me and personally thanked me for convincing her to go for the BRIO. I met her at the WORD festival last August and read some of her work and it was definitely BRIO award worthy. She sent it in and she won. She thanks me with a kiss and a hug. Ummmmmmm....... you got a check for two g's in your pocket and you kiss and hug me??? Fuck you! Put some money in my hand! LOL ..... nah.... I am happy that I touched someone.  Of course I was kinda pissed in reading Oscar's Bio on the program for the night. Some brainiac spelled Acentos wrong. I tried to correct as many as possible with my pen but I wasn't going to ruin my night.  The fiesta continued at the Blue Ox and it was cool. It nice packed house with an abundance of readers on the open mic. Oscar was on point hosting and everything was cool. I read two new pieces and I have some work to do on the love poem. Yes.... Fish wrote a love poem.  It was a good day with a mix of being proud, worried, happy, miffed. You know how it goes.....   Proud of Oscar Happy for the Bronx Worried about Eric Miffed over general shit  My circle tends to give me an erray of emotions.  Life is good though.   6:13am  Peace, love, porkchops

      Yep.... the body acclamated rather quickly to waking up at 4am. It was second nature for a while and my fears of falling asleep at the wheel have diminished rather nicely. Either that is the case or all this is a fuckin dream.  Last night I caught a great BBC special on channel 13. The typical documentary about the rigors and emotional strangulation of reporters on the front lines of war. Which war???;Iraq you fucks. The documentary was a "farenheit 9/11" light. Maybe if you add the voiceover of the fat bastid, the similarities would have been humorous. I caught about an hours worth and it was enough to make my stomach turn and bring the blood pressure up several notches.   Most of the time we were given a first hand view of the reporters being filmed reporting. Kind foolish if you ask me.  What threw me was the treatment of some of the Iraqi folks by the American soldiers. At one point they showed 6 soldiers hog tie about 30 iraqi's and ask them questions about weapons; shove their faces into the dirt; talk to them as demeaning as possible.   The thug in me strted to understand why so many iraqi folk make a bomb and leave it on the side of the road now. It is the age old mantra of....  " You do this to me ; I do this to you "  That vicious fuckin cycle that was initiated by us going over there. Can you blame someone taking an AK-47 and shoving it up your ass after that person tied you up and left you in the 105 degree sun for 5 hours??? Then they let go of one Iraqi and give him clippers to release the rest and the Americans leave.  Shit is not right  Kerry and Edwards...... you want to win??? Say this:  " We will bring our troops back home and handle the middle east and Iraq crisis diplomatically"  Shit; lie or not..... I'll vote for your ass. Then again.... I don't trust none of you fucks.  5:49am  Peace

      Sometimes you hear things that you know will happen.  No matter how much you live in reality and trace your steps on the borders of life; it hurts.  Life keeps moving and it never waits for you. This is something I have grown to accept over the years. You have to either grab that horse by the mane and hold on for the ride or just admire the horse from a distance and relish in it's beauty.    Fish

      Hola young nose pickers. I am back from probably the best vacation I have had in years. It is one of those " refreshed " feelings of having time off type thing. I completely acted a fool and did my thing at.......  Jones Beach Orchard Beach City Island Central Park Bear Mountain Poconos Norfolk Ct ( KickBox )  .....and it all rounded off hosting Bar 13 last night for the man himself; Jerry Quickley.  After feeling so much stress; time off has re-newed my faith in hitting the fucking lotto and giving this job the perpetual finger. Maybe even pulling down my pants and mooning everybody on the way out.  My next jaunt away is for three days to the Jersey shore with more poet folk. I am really looking forward to having a good time. I am taking my hammock and I hope there are two eligible trees out there.  Then...... August 3 is nats I will be out there. St louis...... you better be ready.... NY looks heavy this year.  Long day today....  IF ya love me....... E-mail me DAMMIT!!!!!!!!!  Peace  Fish
