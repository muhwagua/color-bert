      Thy in a Vibe, hmmmm trying to picture it.. hey if you selling your car can i buy your hub caps from you, hahahahah 180 horsepower only apply to the top of the line GT model, it's 130hp if you get the lower end one Get a Jetta, girls look hot in a Jetta to me for some reason. Not applying that your not hot already, we all know Thy is a HOT PIECE OF ASS!! haha  Mrs. Pitt and Mrs. Thompson, i don't get it must be inside joke... Annie did you and Nathan get drunk one night and got married? hahahhaha  I found the Quizno at Crystal City today, but damn Quizno is expensive.. Order the usually regular sub with drink and a cookie, total came out to ~$8.. Wow!!, they better lower their price or I might go broke from eating there.. That place is a little over rated to me, it's good but not worth the $8.. Who spends $8 for a single person at a fast food restaurant haha, I could eat so much more somewhere else..  Whoo MELTING POT, tell me how it goes or how the food is there. I'm going there in a few more weeks, can't wait can't wait..  Okay enough blogging for me, take care people Later

      yeah, I mean..there's "professional" athletes that never win!!  So, we're professional gamblers that also never win.  But that will all change with my new mastery of "How to win at 7 card stud - Medium and Low Limits" by Roy West.  hahaha    And Thy, remember..I still have that number if you think you might need it.  hehehehe  Why would I be happy about your car being dead? (YES!!!)  How much are you selling it for?  I'm in the market for a new car...hahah, just kidding.  I don't want your car, not because I don't like it though.  I don't want to have to worry about it everytime I park somewhere...it IS the most stolen car in No. VA!!    Oh yeah, new apartment tomorrow...you're gonna have to stop by and check it out..help me cook!!  hehehe  and we can sit on the floor and eat!!  Okay okay, I have a table.  There will be a nonstop craps game in the corner..if you want to play, just huddle around.  Classes go at 430 and 630...

      One of those days  So, let's see..how did it begin..I awoke this morning with a couple things on my To Do List..Fix my headlight, Take my Calculus Test  First, my headlights...I go to Pep Boys and get  a couple new bulbs, only to find out that while the book says I need H1 55W bulbs, I do not need these...they are 1 prong, my car has 2 prong bulbs..So, I return those and figure I'll just wait and do it another day..I have to take a test  So, then it's off to study for a bit and take my test...but wait..where the  FUCK  is my graphing calculator?  Hmm...must be at home..I'll just go study and home and come back to take the test..but once again, where the  FUCK  is my graphing calculator?  Certainly not at home!!  Okay, I'm pissed, but no big deal...I go to wal-mart and buy another one, and I'll return it when I find mine.  So, that's all taken care of.  Off to the school once again to study and then take my test.   So, I study for about 30 minutes, refreshing my memory on extremas and analyzing graphs.  Go to the testing center...Open up my syllabus that has the test slips.  This is starting to look familiar..Where the  FUCK  are my test slips?!?!?!  The test slips that are normally stapled to my syllabus have somehow vanished.  So, 100 miles, a half tank of gas, and a lot of stress later I find myself at home...Having not taken care of  SHIT  today!!    So, today was one of those days that I just felt like dropping my car into third gear, mashing the accelerator down to the floor, and driving into oncoming traffic.  Just to assure myself that some unlucky bastard will also have a bad day...I need a nap.

      Oh shit it's Nathan birthday, I didn't even know hahahaha.. Guess i'll finish off the second verse of that birthday song.  How old are you now? How old are you now? How old are you now? Happy Birthday, Dude!!!   HHmmmmmmm AC this weekend coming from Thy, how often have we heard this phrase.  Hahhahah just messing with you Thy.  Black Thy Black, red is unlucky. I don't know if your just addressing this to Nathan cause it seem like your the only two that really post on this site. Well i know i can't make it for sure, got to go to DC and also work on a 5-6 page paper due tuesday. Shit this summer class is damn tiring.  For Thy: Just to let you guys know McDonalds is having their 2 for $2.22 deal again. To bad it's the Big Mac and Fries, bring back the fillet o' fish which i like much much better.  Remember when that shit was 2 for $2 before they had to go and add that extra .22 cents. What's next 3 for $3.33, hahahahahha who can eat 3 sandwiches anyways? Hmmm I bet i can if it's the fillet o' fish, yummy.  Later

      ahhhh i have down time @  urlLink work  right now...  lets see. i should inform you guys that the company gave me  FREE  day with pay on monday. well i was planning [ with 2k ] to head to Philly to see some places and plus i havent been to Philly in a longgggg time. Well Friday, something simple my friend was going to change something for me in my car. fuel filter. well he breaks it or breaks the mass air flow meter. which is costing about 200-300 bucks. yeah  hundred  bucks.....so then Philly was outta the question to go because i had to get it fixed asap.  well off to the junkyard in Hoodbridge...   2 brothers : " so what are you looking for "  me: um a cover thingy  2 brothers: " a what !??1?" me: "you know a cover thing for the filter. we broke it"  2 brothers : finding the model and stuff  and then says " go ahead " me: [sweating b/c im lying] um thanks, do you know how much is it [should be 25 bucks] 2 brothers: " well we dont know unless you bring it " [ to rip me off ]   so we're in there a hour ( 2k and i ) digging around looking for a 1991 camry and i found one ....and it was the perfect piece. sooooo we took it and put it in the toolbox and walking away...  see the catch here. i was goin to  PAY FOR THAT PIECE  which end up costing $25 bucks but i didnt have cash with me, only credit cards. well they told us we can go to the gas station ....  kurt : " should we go back " me: " i dont know " kurt: "i dont know either"  and kept driving hahahahaha we're so bad. plus when kurt says " bad karma " and then what happens at my house. or my cousin house up the street.  SOMEONE HITS  my cousin's jeep back window and there's blood from it. ewwww and cops come and shit.   i guess kurt was right..what comes around, goes around......blah . but my cousin didnt care and we might have   urlLink 2 BIG MEDANG   guys coming to kurt's house, if they took his plates....hehehe

       urlLink WEEKEND WEEKEND WEEKEND   ah what a weekend. let see:   Friday : went to  urlLink buzz  and saw dilija (sp?) and lemon d spin and bad boy bill spin too. I seem to notice everytime I see BBB , his beginning set is always good then it just gets too housy for my style. tm1nor style. but it was a good night , one bad thing was....WAY too many people. so that made that place so hot and sticky it was gross. yuck. fellow mofo ,  2K  aka kurt...he got to grab one of the free records they were giving out free and he waited for both the djs to come out and they wrote " 2K " on the record and their autographs....kurt ! youre such a groupie ! but i need to see to record still.     Sat : anita lee threw a party at her house. her roommates were gone and it was time to party. i did upload the pics and i will link them up here for everyone to see. and to laugh at. we must say  NATHAN  was the best out of everyone. well more like a test mouse b/c we could have done anything to him while his ass was sleeping and he was in his deep sleep. i wish i had a pic to post on  urlLink this site . so overall it was a good night !!!!!!!!!!!  so tm1nor must sign off . because a certain someone just called....wink wink

      Dude, Mezcal is the nastiest shit I've ever drank!  It's like Tequila X 10!   Damn, just thinking about that shit makes me feel kinda sick.    Oh god, I don't know if I even want to see any pictures...I think I probably just passed out on the couch, so hopefully I didn't do anything too crazy...I was way tired before I even got there.  I think I had slept, at the most 9 hours in 3 days.

       *YAWN* , oh yeah I just woke up and it feels great.  Good thing I chug down that huge glass of water before i went to sleep to prevent me from dehadrating, works every time.  Now if only i could prevent myself from turn red, damn missing enzyme.  I swear there must be a pill or something you can take that can prevent it from happening.  I don't know what Mezcal is but damn Nathan I wish i was there to see you take the worm shot and seconds later puke it back out Hahaha.. Hey the dude behind the counter did say it's gurantee to fuck you up. I guess he was right, Hahahahaha  "I don't even remember going to sleep" , don't worry we have a million pictures to refresh your memeory if needed. Hahahahahaha, can't wait till Thy post them. TIme to go eat, I'm hungry.. Later

       Mezcal is discusting!!   Okay, so that was the first time I threw up in I don't know how long!!  And I was sooooo late to work this morning, but I don't know if I'm in trouble yet.  I was supposed to be in at 6:45, but I didn't even wake up until 8:30.  So, I woke up this morning, and it was light outside...I had the alarm set on my phone, but my battery died...no luck.  I don't even remember going to sleep.  When I headed up there, I wasn't even planning on drinking too much.  I'm not hungover, but I think that might be because I'm still half drunk.  I probably should've just stayed home last night.  I was already really tired before I went.  Yeah, I don't think I'll be drinking again for a while....

      yea yea..you'll get your damn pics!!  Once again, I'm at work and I did not get near enough sleep last night.  And, as much as I would like to say I'll get a sufficient amount tonight, I know that I will not.  I'm an important person with important things to do...this alcohol's not going to drink itself!!  haha  I've been honing my beer pong skills, so you all better just watch out!  Seems like everything that starts out bad turns around and works out better for me in the long run.  Merrill Lynch screwed up my CMA account, so I sold it out...Since then the market has dropped over 20%.  So, Merrill Lynch's mistake saved me a little over a grand probably.  But, I still think they suck and won't do business with them again.  Not saying I would ever turn down a job offer from them, but I won't open an account there again.    Maybe I should at least pretend to be working..but what's the point?

      What!! Thy a Liar, how dare you accuse her of such nonsense.  She might be a disser but liar, No.    Oh yeah AC this weekend, Nathan are you up for it? Hahaha  Thy, it's still July and I already got 2 post, you better hand that "once a month" title to somebody else  Oh yeah since you guys are talking about alcoholic drinks, I picked up a small bottle of some mystery drink with a worm in it. It might be Tequila(it is from Mexico), who knows. Guarantee to mess you up according to the dude behind the counter if taken. So who wants to be the guinea pig and chug that shit down? Somebody is getting fuck up this weekend, can't wait.  Crap I'm repeating what has already been posted, I just realize you can read prior posting.. I should have read before typing anyways i'm too lazy to delete. Later people

      Apparently,  THY IS A LIAR!!!   So, last night I spent numerous hours in a vain attempt to beat Thy's "Comanche" record (I was at work, so it would've been time wasted anyways).  Only to find out that Thy's high score of 980 was nothing but a clever hoax designed to make me feel inferior.  I feel so cheated...  Okay, I know what Fris is...but your link doesn't work.

      Dood, Big Brother 3?  HAHAHA  I can't even watch TV, cable's out at work...so, I'm watching the movie Traffic, although I've seen it while at work about ten times.  Someone left it here, and it's either this or Rocky 2, so I go back and forth...rocky 2, traffic, rocky 2, traffic....you get the point.  But I don't really watch it, more just background noise..it's too quiet here.    Yeah, Minority Report was the longest movie  EVER!!!     What kind of alcohol is it with the worm?  Tequila?  That's gross, my friend had a bottle from his trip to Mexico and he ate the worm...Instead of just swallowing it though, he actually chewed on it..NASTY!    What's "cute fritz"?

      I would prefer NOT to be called marine boy, but whatever.  Yes, I JUST woke up...usually I wake up earlier after partying, which I did...but I was hurting and had to go back to sleep.  The shake N bake was exquisite.  Thy is such a good cook.  I can't wait to move to Springfield, so you can come cook for me!  haha  Thy was drunk, but I on the other had stayed sober throughout the night...didn't I?  Oh, I can't remember, maybe I was drunk.  My arm hurts from arm wrestling last night, so I guess that proves that I was in fact drunk..haha

I'm not going to write that much, because....I don't feel like it.  So, tonight we will party...oh, but I don't think I can drink too much...trying to get a handle on this calculus crap, and alcohol causes the mind to fade.  hahah

      Blah blah blah, I'm talking to a blogger box... Don't anyone call anybody anymore, I don't believe in AIM or Blogs(I'm going to get you guys all journals for Christmas) Hahaha.   My last blog was just to check to see if anyone actually checks this site anymore, I guess we have at least one frequent blogger. You do have too much time on your hands simon, get back to work hahaha.. Hmmm what am i talking about i'm slacking right now writing this blogger entry.   So you want blogs right i'll give you some blogs  My week for the fall semester is going to be hell, Mon. work from 9-6, Tues-Thursday work from 9(going to try coming in at 8) till 3 then head straight to Mason and stay till 10pm.. don't get home till probably around 11, eat a midnight dinner, shower, study if time permits and then off to bed.  Friday i get the day off from work but i have afternoon classes which isn't too bad because it ends at 4:30 and then i'm free from then to enjoy the weekend.   Me, Stella, and Tommy(work friends) decided to play the 105+million Big Game on Tuesday and guess what guys i have something to tell you. NO i didn't win the milllion dollar jackpot(would have been awesome if i did, new cars for everybody) but i hit the powerball which equals to $2 in winning, so i made a $1.. So out of the 3 times i've play I hit the powerball twice, not too shabby.   Annie's party was awesome until some cock sucker mother fuck bitch shit turd go die stole my camera and annie's cell phone. Who the fuck goes to party's just to steal shit, grow the fuck up and buy your own shit. I swear if i find that bastard that stole my camera, it's ass beating time. Sorry guys i'm still piss off about it, they will get it KARMA as thy would say. What goes around comes around....  Oh my gosh thy go to the Redskins game, that would definitely be my choice... Your so lucky, I would die for the opportunity to go see a SKins game plus with the new coach and his style of play calling it should be a awesome game. Too bad i have class till 10 tonight, urgh just dreading the thougth of leaving work in 1more hour just to sit on my ass again till 10 at mason.   I'm contemplating weither or not i should use my winnings from AC this past Saturday to purchase another camera? I'm looking at the Canon S30 which i could probably get for $400 but i'm thinking i should just buy the same digital elph camera i had that way i would have a spare battery. Anyways  Okay enough blogging, blog tomorrow Later  Did i read beach party sweet, When/Where/How/and Who? Actually the how and who dosen't matter just when and where, INFO please

      so anyway, had another run-in with the law this morning.  got pulled over by a fuckin state trooper on the way to work...  i pulled my radar detector down a little too late.  i told him i forgot to pull it down cause i was in deleware over the weekend.  lucky for me he was nice enough to let me go with a warning.  kinda interesting cause i RARELY get away with just a warning.  this is my 2nd time.  first time was a while ago when i got pulled over right in front of my house.  cop didn't have anything on me that night anyway though cause he only tailed me for like half a mile anyway in my hood...  it's like they somehow know how much i love em, guess that's why they always like to fuck with me...

       urlLink i miss the beach now...   but 1st of all.  jong ...seriously, i know youre trying to make us read your stuff but honestly its funny that you do that but if no one is going to read your blog, they might ready like a few words but then get tired because youre not putting periods and i know its your fun and stuff but no one is reading and to be honest, i would love to read what you have to say or your stories but i cant. so do what you want to do but no one is goin to read it unless you make it that we can read it. unless you dont want us to read it.   ok back to the beach   ill def have pictures (courtesy of sanh's dig cam) up in the week..and i must say, i miss it . having 13 people in there was great. and ONE bathroom. waiting for people to take showers was fun. our place was interesting....it was behind this gay bar and planet x ...but to be honest,  the place wasnt that bad ......i had fun in there. all in all i had a great time. i did have a bad day on sunday because i couldnt sleep and i could hear was 3 people (wont say names) snoring and stuff ....its all good.   def had a great time    rehoboth beach august 16-18      the beach apt - good fridge - ewww lots of drinking - great being 2 blocks from the boardwalk - great parking - a bitch     spending time with your friends and having them for roommates and sharing a nasty bathroom - priceless.   i had a great time you guys ( sorry whoever that didnt make it )  me gots to love the redbull / vodka....  interesting story, about 5am , simon was looking for liquor or any sort of alochol....that was funny. he went to 7-11 @ 6am to find beer !

      Thank god this beach thing is over!!  Now I don't have to hear about how excited you all are to go to the beach anymore!  hahaha    Went to see Road to Perdition the other night with my dad...can't really think of much else to do, since I can't take him to a club or a bar..haha  What the hell else is there to do around here?  So I just realized I haven't drank in about a month...wow.  I think that's some kind of record for me.  Maybe I'll quit drinking now...HAHAHAH  yeeeeaaaahhh right.  Somehow I don't think that's gonna happen  Jong...tried to read your blog, and made it about half way through..Jesus Christ!!

      I wish i could go damn the army damn them and were not even doing anything oh well who likes ninjas check out this site if you want to become one http://www.badbeats.com/KTF/ninjalesson.jpg sorry still can't link them pages yet so this will have to do so how has everyone been i'm sure you all missed my awsome posts here that make no sense so here is another one of those sorry i'm kind of out of it so it may not be as intresting as they usually are but what the hey what can you do but try to read on and enjoy these fine kodak moments did i spell that right i don't care really i'm a immagant with no ejamakation so to bad haha i win that right you read that right what it is i don't know http://www.reasonablyclever.com/ but you gotta check this site out though it's funny as hell you can make yourself with legos it's pretty cool you should of seen the ones i made it's funny as hell or at least i thought so so you better check it out now i mean it or pay no consiquences yoohoo i want some that stuff is pretty good if you ask me there are a ton of good sites i know just give it time and all will be given to you or you can find me and ask me it's probbly simpler that way if you want to find me on aim it's oddjob1979 if messenger use my e-mail use the bam_bam69@hotmail on its the one i have for messenger not the oddjob1979 one thats for real e-mails not junk the bam_bam one was set up for junk but still i get alot of junk why i dont know damn spammers can't stand them i want to kill them all you know what i mean im sure you do cause i do i understand everything i type here up to a certain degree well how was the beach guys was it fun let me know how things went any one hook up for fun i'm sure one of you did if not maybe next time you hear next time just read on it continues haha does this suck trying to read all of this and trying to make sense of it all i'm sure it does casue i'm kind of getting lost as it is but here is another one http://www.dfilm.com/mm/mm_route.php?id=390731 check this one out and you can make your own movies it's cool and funny as can be right now i can't figure out who is who on this thing right now and how to use is so bare with me for now one day i'll figure out how to use this thing it may take awhile so you have to kind of read these to find these sites i put up it's kind of like a scavenger hunt yeah thats it a scavenger hunt but the whole point is to try to make sense of these blogs i put and find the sites i put up  it's really not to difficult but at times it maybe but it's all in the eye of the beholder kind of but not really wow i can tell all ready this is kind of long but it's been awhile so i thought i'd leave you guys with some reading material how ever hard it maybe to read this damn thing my blog muhaha let me c well arkansas sucks i hate that place it's hell on earth if you ask me out side all the time while it's 95-110 out side with 90-100% humidity now that sucks and all you get to wear is long pants and long sleeve blouse on top of a brown shirt with a k-pot and 25 pounds of gear while running around with a m-16a2 gas somthing or another rifle ask nathan he may know the whole damn name really it's kind of long actually nathan may understand what i went though in arkansas or maybe not not sure really you'd have to ask him to find out me i'm just ot lazy to do that but makeing this blog as long as possible is kind of fun so that is why i'm going on like this oh i also got a whole bunch of MRE's in my trunk so if you want some just ask and find me and i'll give you one i got about 20 left still some are good some aren't so you get what i give you no questions asked that is all on that subject matter let me c is there a nother one that i can pop up with wait a minute there is no subject matter on this one well butwhat do you mean by everyone is human T is everyone really human that is a question you must ponder do we live in a a world with a possible extratrestrial or maybe even AI and just don't know about it it's possible if you as me remember the goverment like to hide things from ppl and even though they say there going to tell you you know that there not going to tell you if they don't want to it's as simple as that it maybe like men in blac or independence day or terminator something like that and we just don't know about it think about it you know i man be right on this one we live in a strange world filled with secrets hell one of us maybe one of these never know and we may never find out what powers do we possess and just don't know about we all maybe human but some more extrodnary then others and some better suited with someone then the next person so you really have to think before you do something but it's also good to learn from your mistakes but try to learn from them it's a dog eat dog world out there to head this in mind always look behind you never know what maybe learking in the shadows maybe be a dog or a cat or rat or a cat in a hat or it maybe your worst nightmare so watch what you are doing never know who u can trust and who you can't so be cautious but try to be normal at the same time i know i'm not hehe oh well tough try to live with that for now but really i mean really what is normal if everyone was the same then would everyone be normal probbly but then the world would be such a boring place we'd all be looking for something and no one would ever find it cause we all were so similar but thats where we have to digress from the norm and be our own person and live and do what one can do be free from things that surround them the chains that hold one down you'd be suprised if you really think about it all the things that hold you down there are alot of them just got to break some of them free and live and be yourself then and only then will you be free to pursue what you are really looking for what ever it maybe possible a mate or something that was lost or maybe yoru searching for something but just dont know what but just keep looking and maybe one day you may find it like in hook with those marbles he wasn't crazy he found his marbles though and he was happy it maybe something simple or not that is something you have to decide and only u really can but others are out there to helpyou along the way if one is alone then one cannot grow it is not you that shape yourself but everything around u that shapes you think about that would you be the same if you lived somewhere else met different ppl yes more then likely we all grow depending on our enviroment and our genetic makeup so try to explore what you can and should on that note i'll leave you so think this through as deep or not deep as it maybe never know what may grow but just heed this look and thee may find what one was looking for or to be yes indeed.

      apparently, i just can't stop getting into trouble.  i took a little break from work to go outside and tan in the park down the street.  i only tanned for like 10 minutes cause the sun was starting to go down.  no sooner had i got back to my car than a cop car rolls up to the park with its lights on.  cop gets out and goes to the park and looks around.  i hop in my car and start to leave.  as i'm waiting to turn onto main street, ANOTHER cop car pulls up.  but then they both leave cause they didn't find what they were lookin for (me).  crazy... i got cops called on my ass for fuckin TANNING!  fuckin hillbilly Leesburg...

      hey sanh, don't worry about the football.  i got us covered.  i have a 10+ year old one that's ok, but my dad conveniently "found" a nice one in our driveway not too long ago (my family hates those fuckin kids across the street).  anyway, if that round thing of yours that you call a "basketball" is any indication, you'd probably just get a youth-sized rubber one anyway...  hehe.    so, does anyone know where i can pick up a good detox drink?  hehe...

      oh yeah , i like the  five days   left .....oh i mean almost  4 days  til the beach, i mean ill just excited when it hit thursday because i have to basically pack that night b/c im tryin to get off work @ 12pm and then head to rehoboth beach w / 2k...  so we have 9 people going...maybe 2 more...should be $60 to stay for the weekend, which is phat. a block away and we're gonna have lots of fun with the camcorder. dont worry nathan, well have vid for you to watch and laugh at us.   lets see recap of the weekend    friday  : where else to go.... urlLink BUZZ ...BT was spinning and Micro too. 2 good sets, i havent heard in awhile in the main room. and BT was a foot away from me. they had circe de soliel (sp?) there which was neat, guys are basically rubber, bending everywhere and being monkeys. $30 bucks for the ticket $10 dollars for drinks   sat : where else to go... urlLink ATLANTIC CITY ...nomis , samus, and tm1nor went to the state of new jersey and well we wouldnt have made it .....but we did. luckily samus didnt put  diesel gas in gas tank , i know sanh. watch out for that, you can ruin your engine, luckiy nomis saw that. i was busy lookin for my redbull can to match with my redbull shirt. sanh, can you upload the pic of me with the can, or send it to me....thanks.    1st stop    Tropicana - i must say that place is ghetto . even the indian reservations ones are better than that one. its too cluttered. i know , look at me, talkin about the place, when all i want is to gamble !!!  after breaking even [ i brought $200 ] at that place, we decided to hit our fave place. which ive given $$$$$ to that damn place.We did go to  urlLink Hooters , good chicken wings, i only had 2. i cant eat right when im at a casino.     2nd stop    Taj Mahal - ....and i came out lucky. +175....i guess i should have listen to my friend who told me 13 was her lucky number. d'oh !  I think we stayed about 5 1/2 hours in the atlantic city and went home, got home by 10:10am on a sunday morning. I'll have to tell you I didnt get any sleep  ( i felt like nathan ) and i came home , having my cousins, askin me if i was hungry and of course i was. so we cooked and after that i headed to the pool over my cousin's house [ which is up the street ] and i stayed there for 4 hours or so. and i am tan. ok not tan. but i have a base tan going on, so when friday comes around, ill be good to go to tan. I did show nomis my skill of swimming. i think he would say " free entertainment " . and its true.   Now its Monday. work was ok ... tomorrow is tuesday and then its wednesday and then its thursday and then its friday    urlLink listen to this   --- i have to order the poster.

In the last 9 days I figure I've worked at least 108 hours, and I've taken 4 tests in calculus.  Calc is done now, but I'm still on this shitty schedule for another week and I have my Econ final on monday.  Can't wait till it's over!!    Sounds like everyone went to AC, and I'm stuck at work!   YOU ALL SUCK!!     Hope you all have  FUCKIN FUN  at the  FUCKIN BEACH!!   I'll be entertaining my dad who will be in town for the weekend.  Haven't seen him in over a year, so it'll be nice.    Okay, I'm getting off work in 30 minutes, so I better get a couple things done

      Gosh i need to get into the habit of checking this site more often, I leave for a couple of days and you guys write a boat load of "Blogs".  Now that i'm done reading what you guys wrote,  YES THY I DO READ THEM NOT JUST REPLY!!!   Hahahah   WHAT, THY'S SINGLE!! , well i'll be damn I didn't even know you had a boyfriend hahaha. Just messing with you, yeah welcome to the Singles Club.. I'm not just a client i'm the fucking President, hahahhaha.. hold on that wasn't funny, must find girlfriend now!!! So Thy what are you doing tonight?  Yeah sure Simon, wouldnt' that be some kind of assualt if you were to bitch at the "Pig".  I'm sure those pigs would have gotten us for something even if we had nothing againt us.  What an abuse of power, next time Simon make sure the light is green before you scream out profanity hahahah.    So Nathan when are you having the house warming so we can check out your crib?   Hi Annie!!!  16 more days and counting.  FInally i'm done with my summer class, gosh what a relief.  So my final grade will depend on how well i did on the final, if i got an A on the final my grade for the class would be an A anything less and i would probably end up with a B. Must go pray now!!  Okay too much blogging, i'll blog tomorrow.. Later

      SOOOOoooooo, i put in a 17-hour day yesterday.  I left work last night at 3 in the morning.  Definitely a record.  Hopefully one I'll never break.  But luckily I get this many extra dollars for all my extra hard work: $0.  All I got was a grilled chicken salad...

      hahaha, alright look.  about the cop thing.  when he pulled up on sanh's side i realized real quick that he might give sanh some shit if i gave HIM some shit.  SOOOO, i shut up for SANH'S sake!  actually, if sanh had drank nothing and i was sure the pig didn't have anything on us, i might've been more apt to open my mouth.  then again, maybe not cause i was also thinkin about me being on probation....   so ANYWAY... here i am in front of my coputer, 9:11pm, at WORK!  ...AGAIN!

       Tire Hit Counter = 8  Just my luck, Yes!! You read correctly 8 freakin' flat tires total.. Lets see  5 on my Camry,  WHY ME!! , just horrible i tell you 1 on Thy's Camry, coming back from AC i was driving at the time.. Sorry Thy :-) 1 on my Dad's Maxima, this was a expensive one.. Dad made me get the good tires to match the other ones and now 1 more for the my Camry which makes a total of 8. It was costly this time, $95 just to get my car back from stupid ass towing company.. I would have pulled a Chanan but gosh there were too many employees working at the moment and it dosen't make the getaway any easier with a flat.  Wow!! 8 flat tires in 2 years i think that is like a Guiness Book record maybe Nathan you thought your 4 was bad, i've double what you got..   I should work for the Nascar pit crew or something, I've master changing tire.. Can probably do it in under 1min. hahahhaha anyways,  I think i need to start investing in better tires made of more resilent marterial, this cheap rubber shit just ain't cutting it anymore.   See you guys later tonight Need to go do some shit for my family and study for Tuesday final, Later

       urlLink dreams i love dreams   let me finish up my dream. the other day.   let me recap my dinner @  urlLink melting pot  which was  ab fab ! ...so good. i think the bill came out to be $140 bucks for two people. its so good though. this is the order :  1) cheese fondue - we got the fiesta cheddar one 2) salad - CA style salad  3) main course - i got the shrimp and sirlion (yum) it comes with veggies you can boil in the broth we got which was some french broth... 4) desert - let me tell you " it was god "  and surprise surprise....THY ate all of her food. ! yes. i ate every single bite...plus it was $70 dollars worth of food. i had great company too.   afterwards. i was stuffed and tired but i told nathan i would come over and check out his new pad....well that didnt happened. i got a call from SAI asking if i was still coming .   went to bed .........la la la land.   next thing you know - im at nathan's crib....but its a apartment but yet it isnt....it was like a 5 bedroom apartment.....kinda set up like russel simmons apt in nyc before the wtc attack, if you guys watched cribs....anyway i saw his masterbedroom but his roommate was ANITA....and Craig was goin to join later...and anita got the master bedroom with the bathroom, and im asking nathan why he didnt get that one b/c it has a bathroom and shit. and then he shows me his room, downstairs its like a fuckin huge ass basement room. and he has a driveway outside his room...like people were droppping off shit to him. it was funny.   so nathan decided to throw a party and of course me i invited  9238298329382  people to come. even marines showed up ! and next thing you know all of my friends are drunk as shit, like all my friends, simon was there, sanh, annie, her friends, my friends, everyone....except luke. odd. anyway....so i sober up after a few shots and next thing you know. cops show up to nathan's apt. his 1ST night there. cops are there. so nathan is drunk laying down in the driveway. and the cops were asking who owned it so i took cover and came up to them and they thought i was the coolest girl there. so this lady cop asked me to find the underage people there and bring them to her. so i told her ok. but she gives me a basket of like wrist bands (like the ones at buzz if youre 21) and to give to anyone who is 21 and over to put a band on...so i knew everyone and i know the people that was underage (ie. annie) so i gave her a band...and it was cool and then the cops left but then nathan was so drunk...we had to take him to the hot tub he had ....but then i woke up or something and then i had the dream again and he had more roommates and it was people from my highschool that i dont even hangout with. it was weird then.....but it felt so real b/c i woke up with a headache and i thought it was from the party. hahah but it went away....WEIRD huh???~?

      hmm....5 am, still at work...doing calculus.  In the last 24 hours, 11 of them were spent doing calculus.  I  BOMBED  my test yesterday, because I was too tired to think.  But my teacher is kind enough to let me retake it tomorrow.     Muchos Gracias to Simon for helping me finish bringing my crap from my car to my apartment, and for my first case of beer brought into it!!  Thanks man!   Oh yeah, and for Thy saying she'd stop by at 11.  It's the thought that counts.  You were there in spirit, I guess...hahaha    I thought a BBQ and a drinking party were like the same thing...hmmm...I'm confused now.  Are you meaning to tell me that the two can actually be separated into two separate events?  I don't know if that's possible.  Maybe....that's too much for me to think about right now.  It's too late.  I'll have to look into that, do a little research.    I think I'm gonna go see Signs on Sunday, during my  LONG  12 hour break from work!!!  Damn, this schedule sucks.   BUT , 302 days left!!  Sweet...

       urlLink moulin rouge!   wow , amazingly i am awake. usually im sleeping in til 1pm or 2pm....but maybe its the factor i didnt do much last night.   1]i did enjoy a good dinner with a  fellow blogger  (hook it up sista)  2] i did a lot of cd burning....that i ran out  of cds...  i keep reading these other  urlLink blogs  on blogspot that i think im gonna start a webring of people from DC- VA - MD area. i keep getting emails for a meetup in DC for this stuff. we could be meeting some interesting people.   I'm very very very very exciting about  urlLink this . I mean 700,000 people going to this. how crazy will that be. i do have one problem. bathrooms. Ive  never  and i mean  never  went into one of those porto-potties....i just think its gross and nasty that i cant even bare to go in one of those. i really cant. i rather pee in front of everyone than do that  [ ok thats abit much too much info ] but still . and i guess im gonna be goin in a bush or something b/c i swear im not going to go in one of those things. ick. just the thought is gross.   how was aqua guys? the party for the sorority party ...let me know how it went down.  there is never too much information   urlLink ON BUZZ ....  i think some of us will be going to edge tonight, being it is the last night for a " rave event "  [ whatever that means , fuckin bastards ] .....and plus usual suspects....i need to show off my dancing skills....one.....more......night........  i cant get enough of  urlLink coldplay

       urlLink october is just around the corner ...  fall is here and i can feel it. i kinda dig the fall feeling...im more a fall person than winter. but winter is good for  urlLink this  but fall you get to see the leaves changing and the cold weather as well.   - im home - on a  thursday  which is very odd for lil tm1nor.....usually shes  urlLink here  or  urlLink there ......but somewhere....well hopefully ill be out this weekend but who knows.....im still under the weather and i would LOVE to feel 100% when im going out. maybe ill just be DD. I do have a friend in town for a week or so from the army, and i havent seen him in  5 months ....def have to take him out and get his ass drunk so we can have our drunk talk =) sadly , i found a fellow blogger ( a few weeks ago ) that has gotten active duty orders ( hes in the reserves ) ....so def we will throw a lil party for him ...  how was the  barber shop  you guys? was it good or not ? it looks funny but i think ill wait for video for it.   btw , edge the night club next to buzz is shutting down their event " stereo " so this sat night is the last night , and  usual suspects  is spinning so i might to go that if i dont go to  urlLink this  but its the last time edge is having something because they are shutting down " RAVE EVENTS " , which is a bunch of bullshit to me. seriously, they are aiming at clubs that play " electronic music " and its just downright wrong. fuck up cops, like ice cube said " fuck the police " ... and while working today, a co worker gave me my washington city paper, and i was fliping through them and i saw a page spread with Buzz , blah blah 9 years and stuff and i got sad. blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  friends was funny tonight, when monica asked racheal if she loved joey and shes like " sure ..... " and asked again and said " yea whatever " . that was funny.    urlLink listen to this    urlLink lets go to this

( yes i bet simon / sanh think i have a lot of times on my hands...)   ok ...people don't live in seven-person apartments atop casinos/hotels in Las Vegas. They are living @ the palms resort ...These people were naked and skinny-dipping within the first night, I presume. It was hard to gauge a timeframe on that damned show. The good little Louisiana girl) is already sleeping in the same bed with one dude (and he wouldn't shut up, which is ruined his chances), and making out with another dude (who had the most annoying drunk voice in the world ... like ever). People don't do this.  Bad. Bad. Bad.I  will probably watch this show for the entire duration of the season as the clips at the end showed  (a)  a fight between Annoying Drunk Voice Guy and Little Girl With A Weight Complex;  (b)  the Hick From Pennsylvania is obviously a psycho, and is going to drag this making out episode out for fucking-ever;  (c)  Annoying Drunk Voice Guy might have gotten Potential LA Stripper Girl pregnant! Can you believe it? Impossible.  ok ok my real world BLOG on that....ok ok so what i like the real world. Its fun and im gonna join haha...You guys can see me on there right?!??!?!    urlLink listen to this   Finally.

       Hahaha I was just messing with you guys in the chatroom. It's impossible to carry a normal conversation, now you know why i hate it. Anyways, Rounders is out at Bestbuys for $12, go get it gambler addicts     SYNOPSIS  Set against the backdrop of New York's high-stakes underground poker world, Rounders is the tale of Mike McDermott, a master card player who trades the poker-playing rounds for law school and a shot at a new life with his girlfriend Jo. For Mike, the new life he's staking out seems like a legitimate road to success, but it's short on the thrills and excitement of back room poker games. But when Mike's longtime friend Worm is released from prison, Mike is faced with the high-stakes dilemma of his life: to keep on the straight and narrow, or deal himself back into the world of the Rounders.    Good movie and well worth the price, only $3 shy of a movie ticket.. Gosh movie ticket are overprice nowadays, I remember back in the day it was like $5.50. Shit i'm starting to babble Later

       No genius, James is the name of the chef at Matsutake hahaha...    I'm not going to blog about my Labor day weekend cause you guys were there for the most part. I also refuse to blog about my trip to Vtech, i much rather wait and tell you guys in person or over the phone. Tell you guys about when i see you Is it just me or does blogging sucks?  Sorry guys i just don't believe in "journaling or blogging" about my weekend to a message board when i much rather tell you guys about... Tell me something i don't know I know exactly what to get Thy for her Birthday, your definitely getting a diary or journal of some sort...  Hmmm i'm babbling again    Anyways here is something worth blogging about...    Want to get into Buzz for as little as $10?  Buzz now offers FREE membership discounts to regular patrons.  How loyal of a customer are you?  Buzz messageboard members who post more than 10 times each week (thru 5 p.m. each Friday) will receive $5 off, for an admission fee of $10 before 11 p.m. and $15 after 11 p.m. (slightly higher for special events).  To be eligible sign up for the Buzz messageboard at: www.buzzlife.com.  10 or more posts each week (thats only 2 posts per day, Monday  Friday) automatically will place you on the Buzz membership guest list.  If you dont post at least 10 times by the end of each week, then you wont receive the discount.  Participate in your local EDM community  it pays off!  More details at: www.buzzlife.com    Damn who who have thought  Buzz  is going to finally have a guestlist, hahahah that just seems funny for some reason...   Actually it's a smart move by the Buzz advertisment board.. Get people to post on their message board to build up the Buzz Message Board Community so we can get a discount. Genius, spreading the word for free by forcing us to post if we want that discount.  It's a win-win situation almost except for people like me who don't really have time to post.  Hmmmm i might just have to start posting now, hahaha i think not    I'll blog more useless findings tomorrow.. later people

      After Awhile  After awhile, you learn the subtle difference  Between holding a hand and chaining a soul, And you learn that love doesn't mean leaning And company doesn't mean security, And you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts And presents aren't promises, And you begin to accept your defeats With your head up and your eyes open And you learn to build all your roads on today Because tomorrow's ground is too uncertain for plans. And futures have a way of falling down in midflight. After awhile, you learn That even sunshine burns if you get too much. So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, Instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers. And you learn that you really can endure, That you really are strong. And you really do have worth. And you learn and learn... With every good-bye, you learn.

       urlLink brit pop night anyone?   shouts to my boy  Rick ! for showing me the  urlLink blackcat  last night....i dont think half of my friends would have liked it but i think ill be going there every month....[ only happens once a month ] ... it plays " brit pop "....what is "brit pop " you might ask yourself? kinda like  1] the cure 2] happy mondays 3] the smiths 4] etc.  they did play " wheres your head at " and threw in " one more time "....which a lot of ppl didnt really like ....but i think simon showed the real brit pop lovas how to really " dance ".....   simon  - " whooo hooo, i can dance my ASS off !!! "   blond chick  - " why is he swinging his hands and feet like crazy ?!?! "  simon  - " im so drunk, i can talk to ANY girl "  blond chick  - "poor boy"  hah. ok that convo didnt go on but it was probably what the chick was thinking when she saw simon dance his  ASS  off !  also, i made a new friend ! his name is David and hes awesome! thanks for coming out last night ...and thanks for  urlLink IHOP  ...   but all in all, it was a good night, eventhough tm1nor is sick !! i will get better !!   ps. sorry samus that i change my mind millions of times....and i need to take that thing off. takes too much space.....

      yeah these blogs are getting deep. i do know youre hurt , i would be too in your place...  one thing to do ----------> move on and this weekend will be HELLA fun because i cant wait for  urlLink it

<date>02,July,2004</date>
<post>

     
      first of all, damn.  these blogs're getting kinda deep...    ok, now obviously i gotta reply to thy's last blog.  i realize i've put her (and others) in a bit of a predicament with what's been going on...  for that, sorry guys.  but in my defense it's really not something that would've been avoidable anyway.  it would've been kinda hard to go on pretending everything's just peachy.  it's easy to do w/people you don't really know too well or aquaintances, but not close friends.  not with shit like this.  sooner or later, shit would've hit the fan anyway.  its inevitable that tempers are gonna flare (mine), people are gonna get mad, and people are gonna get hurt.  now, i'll explain...   a lot of what you said is true.  i know where my anger (and the blame) really belongs.  in fact, i'm starting to direct it more towards her the more i think about all this.  secondly, i know he wants to be with her.  there's nothing wrong with that.  i can't be mad at him for that.  and while i still believe that it's fucked up to go after the ex of someone you know, i know that's debatable with some of you (but come on, just 2 weeks after a breakup??? wtf???).  i'm not mad at him because of any of that.  i'm mad at him for fucking hanging out and playing ball with me, all the while knowing that i DIDN'T know what was going on.  i'm mad at him for being 2-faced, for being fake.  if he had been straight with me and told me the truth, yea i would've been mad and still hated him for awhile, but i would've gotten over it and realized he technically didn't really do anything wrong (other than want the ex of someone he knew, which i'm against).  i wouldn't be bent on revenge.  now, having said that, i'll admit that i can't really draw a definite conclusion regarding the matter yet, because he could very well have been told NOT to tell me.  in that case, much more of the blame would shift to her because i probably would've done the same thing in that situation.  finally, i know i set myself up.  i used to tell myself that all the time.  every week, i would start to get close, and something would happen that would remind me i was being stupid.  but it never failed, i would always find myself back in the same situation the very next week.  so yea, i definitely had a hand in my own fate.  however, if i had known the truth from the beginning, none of that would've happened.  i definitely would've kept my distance, and in the end, there would've been no hard feelings.  but, i was misled to believe that none of that sleeping-around shit was happening.  right, i played it dumb.  no question.  but does that mean it's ok to play someone that's playing it dumb?  i don't think so.  this is what i'm REALLY mad about, to be honest (more to myself).  most of my anger towards him is really just misdirected anger towards her.  when it comes down to it, i'm really just hurt.  that's all my anger is.  i refuse to feel sorry for myself, and just turn the pain into anger.  so i get mad.  crazy mad...  i'm just looking for an outlet.

      well to respond to your blog ...i must say something. i realized im on nobody's side. neither her or yours because both of you put yourself in this position. you and her. not her, nor you. both of you guys. and i also realized you should put your anger towards the girl and not all to the guy. yes i understand you dont want to put any shit through her but its more her fault than his and i dont think he deserves all the shit now , i think its enough. maybe he doesnt know anything about you two, nor maybe he wasnt even laughing behind your back because maybe all he wanted was to be with her. not to backstab [ hes not your friend, friend ], or to laugh behind you saying " oh yeah you have no idea ". whatever they did, happen, happen for a reason. could be weakness, could be feelings, could be something else. we dont know. i dont think hes all to blame, its her to blame and to yourself. youre the one that came back to be " more " than friends, and also how many times did EVERYONE tell you to keep your distance away from her, if you want to be friends. you gave in, she gave in. but you know shes weak. you know her better than me, dating her 2 years you know her better, and you better not to give in what you gave her. you dump her, yes you did, but still you should have kept your distance away from her. i mean youre the one that set yourself up, even though we told you many many times that , " he was staying the night  ", or whatever, that should have clue you in, to say to yourself " wait, a minute, maybe i shouldnt get too close to her, to get hurt ", you should have thought of that, yes i can put myself in that position and maybe youre weak, and that you care so much about her, but still, you know better, not to touch in that zone.   all i can say is, we cant blame that guy for it. and i dont think he deserves all that crap. i think you two need to talk about it and be mature about it , or not even talking about it or just let it be and move on.   move on is all you got, now you have a result : no one is friends now, it sucks because both of you two are good friends, and that will never happen again [ i wouldnt even be friends ], but which you could have made it out to be " oK " between you two when you guys go out of jail, and let the " two " to hangout or whatever they were doing. and you do your thing.   life sucks i know but you learn. and i def, learn on my experiences with my relationship.

      To quote Thy: "Its interesting how life can change quickly. How one thing you do can ruin someting you had so great."  SOOOOOO fucking true.  You all know where I'm coming from.  And you know what?  I'm beginning to think that things DO happen for a reason...  I used to think, "Why the hell was I locked up?"  Before, I thought the only reason was to finally get my ass into shape.  But now I think there was a bigger purpose.  Maybe I was supposed to find out what kind of person I was with.  You think you'd know somebody after more than 2 years, but then you find out they're not the person you thought they were.  And sure, life is shitty for the next couple months but then you think, "Well shit, at least I found this out now and not 2 more years from now..."     So yea, life is full of lessons...  Some of us get to learn the easy way by watching others (in this instance, you guys), and some of us gotta learn the hard way (me).  I think I'm destined to learn all of life's lessons the hard way.  My mom always used to tell me: "Some people in life can only learn things the hard way."  Heh, guess that's me...

       urlLink oooooh ahhhhhh ooooooohh aaahhhhhh   GOD. where have i been? not blogging. I know, I know. Bad , Bad on Thy's fault. I need to update some shit on this site. Whenever will I get dsl or cable...please save me. Its interesting how life can change quickly. How one thing you do can ruin someting you had so great. I wonder that at times. For myself, Ive been there, done that. You surely do learn a lesson, but then you think in a way , maybe its a good thing. That things happen for a reason. That so you might learn from it and what they say " learn from your mistakes "...i do believe that. You can never regret things. Well for me, I dont. Never regret.   I thought staying home friday night was a great idea. I think I'm going to try and do that. Stay one night, Go out one night ( if i feel like it ). Its no point going to a bar or club twice a weekend. I really didn't do club-to-club but I've done bar-to-bar plently of times. Its not good. $$$$ . and it does get old. I did go girls night out Sat. night, which was a fun time. Good times. I wonder how fellow blogger,  urlLink Samus  how he felt on going clubbing 3 days in a row ! ....You had DREAM , You had VIP, and You had Murali's....crazy mofo. parttttttttty. now who's the party animal???  I was at a fellow blogger's apartment , and said to myself " 3 more days, and its been a MONTH " ....Yes you guys / gals..... a MONTH....of NO meat....isnt that grand??? Sweet, well show to everyone. 11 more months you guys. Sept. 9th 2003 is just around the corner!  time for bed. i hate mondays. oh yes, this weekend ----->  urlLink oh baby

      wow, thanks for posting that thy.  what a lovely picture of me.  hahaha...  alright, ANYWAY... today's lineups:  Parlay (3 Teams)  $20/$117, this time i went line:   Chiefs(Kansas)      -3    Seahawks(Seattle)  ---  Packers(GreenBay)    +3  Buccaneers(TampaBay)  ---  Raiders(Oakland)       -9.5   Cardinals(Arizona)   my safety this time is just a $30 straight wager.  don't think a 2-team parlay can be considered a "safety" anymore:  Packers(GreenBay)           Over 39 Buccaneers(TampaBay)

      another interesting thing rand0L....  Boortz On Ashcroft From Nealz Nuze: ASHCROFT, YOU IDIOT!   Well, the Homeland Security bill will soon be law. Know Your Customer will be a reality. Now the Imperial Federal Government is going to gain access to virtually every bit of electronic data there is about you. This means everything  from airline tickets to grocery purchases to magazine subscriptions to deposit records to credit card purchases to association memberships. All of it.    Some criticism has been leveled against Attorney General John Ashcroft for his support of this Total Information Awareness program. His response? Well, Ashcroft says I think the kinds of technology that can sell soap in America should be available to help secure the people of America.    OK, Mr. Attorney General, since you dont seem to be bright enough to noodle this one out on your own, let me try to help you.    Yes, some of the local grocery stores do keep electronic records of who buys what type of soap. Yes, these grocery stores will make this information available to people who sell soap, and yes  the people who sell soap might send some marketing materials to the people who buy soap. Nice and clean. But, Mr. Attorney General, guess what? The people who sell the soap are not permitted under our system of laws to pick up guns and force us to buy their product. They can inform and they can encourage. They can offer deals, rebates, prizes and rewards. They can tell us how good we will smell and how those nasty little bacteria will crawl off and die if we just use their stuff. But they cannot use force against us, and they cannot punish, fine or jail us for passing their product by on the shelf.    Youve been around for a while, Mr. Attorney General. Cant you recognize the difference between a private retailer gathering information about customers and a government gathering information about subjects?

      . . . "Total Information Awareness" that would effectively provide government officials with immediate access to our personal information: all of our communications (phone calls, emails and web searches), financial records, purchases, prescriptions, school records, medical records and travel history. Under this program, our entire lives would be catalogued and available to government officials.   urlLink

      I was just looking at the old blogs (bored at work) and I just realized how fast the last 6 months went.  Seems like Thy just started it a couple months ago.  Good times...I also just realized I hadn't blogged in a month or so  I think Simon is developing a gambling problem..still have that number I gave you Thy?  hahaha    Tonight there's a meteor shower, peak times at around 530..that should be cool to watch for about 3 minutes.  I didn't see the one last year, and since I'm up..what the hell..may as well watch it.  So, I think that is all I have to say for now

      Ya know, I cant believe how some people are still stuck in middle school (NOT REFERRING TO ANY BLOG MEMBER IN PARTICULAR, SORRY) The old saying he-said-she-said-bullshit. Why cant people just grow up and find the facts from the horses mouth. DUH! Instead of believing other ONEs who will probably TWIST the truth around! I just found out some disturbing crap yesterday. Though its nothing I should stress over I told myself I wouldnt let it get to me, but the point of the matter is that it just puts me into a different perspective on people from now on.  Finding out who my true friends are I just cant believe I put in so much effort with some people and then find in the end that they were NOT a true friend at all.  Sorry Guys had to vent!! Thanks for listening!!

      die hard instead of simpsons?!?!?!?  wtf???!?  what the HELL was fox thinking?  omfg... that is some crazy ass ridiculous shit.  dude, write the ceo or something.  somebody should be punished!  god.... maybe we should boycott fox... hahaha, ok.  i'll stop.  anyway, what the hell're we doing for nye?  much as i'd LOVE to finally check out trust, baltimore's a *bit* far...  hadn't even thought about the sobriety checkpoints.  definitely wouldn't be cool.  baltimore's *slightly* outside my uhhh--- "allowed radius,"  hehe.

       whats your new years resolution?   1) cut  DOWN  on gambling. (seriously) 2)  STOP social smoking (its not  KOOL ) 3) spend less money (let the guys pay) 3) keep working out 4) speak more vietnamese  5) save money 6) go to vegas , europe , or ibiza 7) be happy

      I'd like to know who's planning on going to trust also.  It sounds like a LOT of fun but how many sobriety checkpoints might we be forced to drive through on the way back?  I guess that won't be too much of a problem, especially if we all stay until morning.   Can y'all believe fox?  They showed that stupid Die Hard movie instead of the simpsons last night.  How old is that movie?

      THY! Hope you are having a blast in chi-town. Don't let that cold wind take you away like a kite. haha.  My friend from N.C. is coming up on the 31st, and I intend to take him and his sister up to Buzz for new years at trust. Should be a good time. Wondering if you and your bloggy bloke friends ( you know who you are ) are planning on doing the same. C'mon C'mon, you know it will be a great time. They are going to rotate dj's every hour, so you know it will be interesting at least.   For photos of the Avalance event go here: http://sideshowbob.darkravers.net/avalanche1221/index2.html I'm in the second to the last shot on that page, but all you can see is my sillouete, but I recall seeing mr sideshow boob take that one.  I'm checking out Filler tonight. You ought to someday. I'm taking a new girl that I met at the Black Cat on Friday, and get this....she's not in college!  Noooo, she's not in high school either. She's got a good job.  We'll see how this works out. Peace.

       urlLink amc theater parking sucks   i went to a  TERRIBLE  movie (dont ask) with my lil cousin and we had our signal on to take this parking space. well apparently the other side didnt see us and when we tried to go in, they were backing in. so im like " no way " but then this HUGE black guy comes out and is just standing there. fucking dumbass we were there for a few minutes because we saw them try to take it. so i figure what comes to mind when someone steals your parking space: answer : " fucking key their car " so thats what i was going to do (nice honda accord, i think v6 too) and of course my ass was too scared because that guy looked like he was going to capped my cousin and I if we didnt leave the space for them. I wish i had eggs. but yeah watch out for the " brothas "  everyone needs to go to springfield mall and check out the " dancing beans " , you can tell them to sit, dance, breakdance, flip, etc. fellow blogger samus and i were pretty amazed about it. i might have to buy it to leave the " dancing beans " at my house (when i move out), its so cool. they do whatever you tell them, with music of course.  2 more full days and im off to chicago. just to get away from washington dc will be good for me. plus im 30 minutes from a riverboat casino. its the asian blood in me that makes me want to gamble and lose! im starting to get sick of dc. hopefully things will get better. same ole shit

      Ahhhhhhhh!!!! I miss out on $7snowboarding and oh my gosh they had .50cents hotdogs argh. Dang nathan you ate 6 hotdogs, that's like (avg. 6in. a hotdog x 6hotdogs = 36in.) Shit you ate 3 feet worth of hotdogs, hahahaha... I did 8 one time, a whole pack but that was without the bun...  So who is up for snowboarding this weekend? You know you want to go...   Not like you guys care but i got mad studying done and i just got home from my final exam this morning.. Looks like all that studying didnt' payoff and i'm left with useless knowledge, gosh i hate cumulative finals. Never know what they are going to ask you, so I'll probably get a B for that course instead of an A, argh.. Actually it depends on how i did on the final, i was borderline A/B and needed to Ace the final to get an A.. Time to pray!!!  Back to a more common blog topic, Did anyone see Fear Factor last night? Thy you think you can eat a 100yr. old egg but can you stomach 100yr. old eggnog? That shit looked nasty, it looked like old clumpy milk but green.. One of the contestant actually yak aftering drinking it, hahahaha funny...  One more thing..  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers ... comes out this wednesday, let's go watch it

       urlLink $7 bucks for 2 DAYS lift pass   first off....i almost didnt go but of course i did go (glad that i did !) and was glad to hear it was $7 dollars and not $44 (reg lift ticket price)...it was so worth it too.While driving to Wisp, we ran into snow and it was snowing pretty good and we were having fun with the van, (thanks for simon) and nathan driving.  i do have a few bruises (rental boots are a bitch) and every part of my body is aching.  Its the 15th and im already snowboarding, thats great and I need to get my own board asap ! My board was from 1946 ...it sure was sweet (damn clickers)....  For a few months, im not going to see nor eat one god damn hot dog. The hotdogs there , were .50 cents and I had three. I think Nathan beat everyone, having 6 hotdogs. My stomach was acting pretty funny on the ride home from  urlLink Wisp . Best snowboarding weather ive had in a long time.  so sooooooooore......

      "Yet, when we own nuclear weapons they are called 'deterrents', when anyone else owns them they are called 'weapons of mass destruction'. "   You know, I found this quote pretty interesting also.  I think this is just human nature.  Nobody sees themselves as the bad guys.  Military might, and dominance is something to be proud of, unless of course you're a weaker country.  Then you're simply a menace who possesses weapons of mass destruction and you probably ought to be nuked off the planet.  ok, thats an exaggeration.   I think terms like weapons of mass destruction serve nothing more then propaganda purposes, cause Saddam's got nothing like what we got.      Anyway, times are good ey?

       "Yet, when we own nuclear weapons they are called 'deterrents', when anyone else owns them they are called 'weapons of mass destruction'. "  The Americans are way too conservative to do anything with them, Russia on the other hand is a different story.   urlLink Let it snow, let it snow!  Thursday: Heavy snow during the morning will end as snow showers during the afternoon. High 37F. Winds NNW at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of snow 80%. Snow may accumulate 3 to 6 inches.

      something interesting i was reading....      Here are some mental facts for you.  There are more than 31,000 nuclear weapons still maintained by the eight known nuclear powers, a decrease of only 3,000 since 1998. Of that 31,000, 95% of these weapons are in the United States and Russia.  Russia has 1,000 metric tons of weapon-grade uranium and about 140 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium. United States has 750 metric tons of weapon-grade uranium and 85 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium.   It takes 25kg of uranium or 8kg of plutonium to make a rudimentary nuclear weapon.  So Russia has enough uranium to make another 40,000 and enough plutonium to make 17,500 more weapons. and America has enough Uranium to make 30,000 and enough plutonium to make 10,625 more weapons.  So adding them together, that's enough to make just shy of another 100,000 nuclear weapons.   Yet, when we own nuclear weapons they are called 'deterrents', when anyone else owns them they are called 'weapons of mass destruction'.  I am not trying to be political or even pass comment on the above figures, but I thought it was worth you knowing. And now you know !   oh yeah simon. come on post them ONE more time.....

        urlLink watch out for what youre downloading   you might ask why? because well i heard something on the news a few days ago about how record companies are trying to figure out a way to stop people (like us, we like  FREE  stuff) to trade and download free music....well the other day at work, i was listening to the net radio and found a song i liked on the daredevil soundtrack, so of course i went to winmx (love it) and started downloading the whole album...its sweet having free stuff. ive downloaded so many albums, so many hours of oakie, oakie ! haha...but so i started playing the whole album, and guess what? they figure out a way! , while listening to the song, into a minute , you will hear like sample sounds of like a phone ringing or some special effect sound ! it kept doing it every 15-20 seconds of that damn song ! it was pretty hiliarous, and then we started every other song, and it did the same damn thing ! so i download some other songs, that are coming , that are pretty new and they do the same thing !   so they are, or starting to finally to stop us... NEVER!!!!

      I'm back, na-na-na-na-naanana. Vail was most excellent. There was a dumping of about 6 inches of fresh powder, which made thursday the best snowboarding day i've ever had. I was wishing you cats could come out and join me. I met a lot of cool peeps out there, as people are more chill in that kinda place. For some reason I kept hearing Pearl Jam being played. I'll have some photos from the trip soon.  Don't forget that this Friday is supposed to be Dara in Reston... If I do go, I know it's going to be hella crowded. Laterz.

RedBull rules my world and I am so glad to be apart of the SBM program. I'm a senior at VCU and a first time member in SBM. I love to do design (thats my major) sculpt and paint, party, work on cars, dj , clubbing, skateboard, snowboard, golf, hockey and turning new people onto RedBull. My classmates say that I am obsessed with RedBull as I always have one in class and also have a collection of RB memorabilia collected from around the world. VCU has a very diverse student body from hard working medical students to extremely creative artists and teachers. Ahhhhh yeah, RedBull just fits in perfect here.....

      ill give it one more try ...  2 times and i tried to  blarg  and blogger wasnt working so i lost what i wrote.    if you look on the left there. yes its my  FIRST  time getting my car towed !!! way to go tm1nor !!!  anyway that day i went to get my front brakes done (thanks PK) and that was hella cheap because my friend PK, did it for  FREE  which would cost me like $60-$100 bucks to do at a autobody shop...so im thinking im saving a lot of money but then that SHIT happens. my car gets towed and from that fucker, that everyone hates. Henrys. they  will  pay , trust me they  will . They tried to give me shit , that they needed proof i owned the car and etc. just a bunch of bullshit that i wasnt happy to hear while trying to get my car out. I know Simon, had his car stolen back twice and thanks to a ex friend / ex girlfriend. heh....but looks like Henry's moved to van dorn street with bright white lights and of course. a wooden metal fence it seems. So there was  NO  way i could ( i would ) steal my car back. damn fuckers. oh well next time. where thes the paintball gun when you need one. I know a few friends of mine that has been towed numerous times and seems like Henrys did most of the towing ....  other news. tomorrow is WED!!!! which means......2 more work days til the weekend. 2 great football playoffs ..... urlLink lets bet simon !  ...and just chilling ( i havent gone to a bar /club in a few weeks now....amazing huh....lil taquito needs a break....plus im moving out soon.    congrats and happy belated birthday to my friend (known him since hs days) , SJ and he has baby twins .

      Poor squirrel.  The ordeal had to be terrifying.  It probably struggled for as long as it could until it was exhausted.  Maybe it even gave up at some point knowing that this was where his/her life would end.  I wonder if he/she left behind any loved ones?  Perhaps theres a widow somewhere wondering when her hubbie is gonna return with the grub.  And you know, shit like this probably happens thousands of times a day all over the world.  I wonder, if we were to add the number of living things that have died agonizing deaths (like being tortured or eaten alive by some predator) since the history of living things, we'd probably come up with an unimaginable number of existences ending in misery.   Anyway, the picture of the squirrel is really depressing.  I can't wait until the summer when the days are long.

      I'd be interested to know how the party was.  The one you guys went to after leaving bob's room.  I tried to go with you guys also but I was too high to really say anything intelligable.  I was trying to tell Simon to stop but all I remember was the back of his head and then the door shut behind him.  What a bastard.  Charo wouldn't wake up quick enough either.  Had a great time though, might've smoked a little too much.  I couldn't help it though, there was so much smoke being passed around.  Big thanks to Bob who hooked me up with some leftovers, and let us chill in his room for quite a while.  J.B. too.  It was a good time.

       pic of the day..     An Albanian man smokes a cigarette as his wife carries hay alongside the national road in near Elbasan, near the capital of Tirana February 24, 2003. In rural Albania, tradition dictates that women to do all the house chores with men never helping as this is seen to be a sign of weakness  how FUCK up is that? shit. i bet all my male guy friends wont mind me doing all the COOKING , for that part. hahah

       aahh me so urlLink  tired .......  these past few days , ive been so lazy. knowing that may is just a few months ago. its kinda " unreal " at the same time.....oh i cant wait. or can i =).....  lets see this past weekend i went  urlLink boarding  ...(i know im a little late on blarging)....and it was a great time. i did a lot better this time than the last time. fellow blogger , 2k and i found some spots to hit (little ones) and 2k was hitting them and jumping on them...unlucky, my friend from highschool Toby, lost his cd player when he fell on a blue slope. sucks. we couldnt find that but we found a lighter.....it was quite cold out for our last run , we got stuck for about 10 minutes on the chairlift (some stupid reason) and ppl were moving the chairs, up ' n ' down...and that was scary... but i was too cold to get scared.   we are planning another trip in a few weeks so anyone down? simon, i think you can go ONE more time. eh? or no? you have to workout 984938439 hours now to catch up on that gut, phatty =)  sorry to says guy, but our trip to NYC in march, i cant make it. yesterday, i bought my plane ticket to chicago for that week....im off to the windy city that weekend, you can come there. buzz is there =) (i dont think ill be there during that night) so you guys can do NYC, or we can do it some other time.

      Not sure if any of you are aware of the battle going on right now, but I found a pretty good article that lays out AOL's interesting  urlLink predicament .  For anyone not aware, a brief synopsis:    A Verizon customer was found to have 666 music files on his computer by an RIAA analyst.  The RIAA subpoenaed Verizon to get this customer's name and address, citing section 512h of the DMCA.  Verizon refused, and the matter was taken to court.  Judge Bates ruled in favor of the RIAA, and Verizon plans to appeal.  Now, the final outcome of this battle has very serious implications.  If the RIAA wins, they'll be able to issue as many subpoenas as they want without going through a judge or providing evidence that a supoena is warranted, and any ISP will have to hand over their subscriber's personal information.  AOL, who so far has been silent about the whole matter, is in a very interesting position, given the fact that it's the largest ISP as well as the largest copyright holder.  It's also a member of the RIAA, and a member of the U.S. Internet Service Provider Association, which has filed a legal brief siding with Verizon.      There's a lot more to all this but that's the basic breakdown.  There's obviously a LOT at stake here.  Sucks that we're basically powerless.  I figured some of you civil rights advocates out there might be interested to know...  =)  It's actually something that probably all of us might want to be aware of.

      one word to describe michael jackson -------->  WOW      besides that, hes sold millions of records....known as the  KING  of pop.....but wow....while watching this 2 hour special on abc has been great and so funny here are my notes i wrote down : ( i didnt write them down, really i didnt ! )  1) my favorite quote has to be , he loves trees and he climbs on one tree.....and so hes climbing and tells the reporter to come up   mj - " havent you ever climb up a tree ? " reporter - "nope" mj - looking so happy " awe, youre missing out " , while hes on the tree....WACKO  actually its funnier if you saw the bit but it was classic (luke agrees)  2) germany LOVESS him . crying fans, while here if you saw a 17 yr old girl , she wouldnt be crying and wanting a hug (except for one guy i know, fellow blogger randall loves him , i hear hahah)  3) he went to vegas, and he rented out 7 suites in the hotel ! , he has everything in his freaking hotel room, games, a mobile cart, he rides down the halls in the middle of the night (when hes bored)  4) he DENIES having plastic surgery.man, brother, stop lying  !  5) his fingernails are odd looking   6) in vegas (again) he buys JUNK...he went to one store and spent $1 million dollars   7) hes worth a billion.....rightttttt found out hes only worth 200-300 million ( a lot still )

      WASHINGTON -- Jaromir Jagr acknowledged Wednesday that he made mistakes when he lost $500,000 betting through an Internet gambling site, but he insisted he paid the debt four years ago and did nothing illegal.  "It was 1998, and I made mistakes,'' Jagr told reporters after the Washington Capitals' practice. "I just wasn't smart. It was stupid. It wasn't illegal, and it was five years ago. Everything was taken care of in 1999. That's all I can tell you.''  Jagr owed the money to William Caesar, owner of the gambling Web site CaribSports, based in Belize. Sports Illustrated reported that Jagr agreed to pay $450,000, split into monthly payments, to settle the debt -- and that Caesar leaked the story to the press after Jagr stopped making the payments.  Jagr disputed that part of the magazine's story, reiterating that the debt was settled in 1999, and that he didn't know why the story was coming out now.  There was no allegation that Jagr bet on NHL games, which would be violation of league rules. Caesar told the magazine he had technicians configure Jagr's betting page so the hockey star could not bet on the NHL.  "We did that for our own protection, not just his,'' Caesar said. "That would destroy us, if he destroyed the game.''

      thanks to nathan....he sent this email....   When I was a kid   When I was a kid adults used to bore me to tears with their tedious diatribes about how hard things were when they were growing up; what with walking twenty-five miles to school every morning uphill both ways through year 'round blizzards carrying their younger siblings on their backs to their one-room schoolhouse where they maintained a straight-A average despite their full-time after-school job at the local textile mill where they worked for 35 cents an hour just to help keep their family from starving to death! And I remember promising myself that when I grew up there was no way in hell I was going to lay a bunch of crap like that on kids about how hard I had it and how easy they've got it!   But...   Now that I've reached the ripe old age of thirty-one, I can't help but look around and notice the youth of today. You've got it so damn easy! I mean, compared to my childhood, you live in a Utopia! And I hate to say it but you kids today you don't know how good you've got it!   I mean, when I was a kid we didn't have The Internet--we wanted to know something, we had to go to the library and look it up ourselves! And there was no email! We had to actually write somebody a letter--with a pen--and then you had to walk all the way across the street and put it in the mailbox and it would take like a week to get there! And there were no MP3s or Napster! You wanted to steal music, you had to go to the record store and shoplift it yourself! Or we had to wait around all day to tape it off the radio and the DJ would usually talk over the beginning and screw it all up! You want to hear about hardship? You couldn't just download porn! You had to bribe some homeless dude to buy you a copy of "Hustler" at the 7-11! Those were your options! We didn't have fancy stuff like Call Waiting! If you were on the phone and somebody else called they got a busy signal! You had the option of an "Emergency Breakthrough" but after a few months of the "Emergency Breakthrough fever," you could tell the operator started hating your very existence. And we didn't have fancy Caller ID boxes either! When the phone rang, you had no idea who it was it could be your boss, your Mom, a collections agent--you didn't know!!! You just had to pick it up and take your chances, mister! And we didn't have any fancy Sony Playstation videogames with high-resolution 3-D graphics! We had the Atari 2600! With games like "Space Invaders" and ! "Asteroids" -- the graphics sucked! Your guy was a little square! You had to use your imagination! And there were no multiple levels or screens, it was just one screen--- forever! And you could never win, the game just kept getting harder and faster until you died! Just like LIFE! When you went to the movie theater there no such thing as stadium seating! All the seats were the same height! A tall guy sat in front of you, you were screwed! And sure, we had cable television, but back then that was only like 20 channels and there was no onscreen menu! You had to use a little book called a TV Guide to find out what was on! Or worse yet, you had to actually look in the newspaper. And there was no Cartoon Network! You could only get cartoons on Saturday morning... ...D'ya hear what the hell I'm saying!?! We had to wait ALL WEEK, you spoiled little brats!   That's exactly what I'm talking about! You kids today have got it too easy. You're spoiled, You guys wouldn't last five minutes back in 1984

      Yea. Good times. Thanks for coming out Y'all, it was a hoot. I still have lots of booze left. There are about 3-4 bottles of good rum to kill, so i'm thinking in the near future to have a movie night, maybe hot tub thing with about 6 people, make daquries and pina coladas, and hitting 3rd degree which is the Reston Drum and bass party that I keep telling you about. I'll keep you posted. Meanwhile matt has posted a lot of pics from the night on his web site.   urlLink  7 deadly sins party !   Kyle even did a shot of the (translated from Latin)  "cock of satan"  pepper vodka, which is really really hot because it's got habinero peppers in it. It's  a lot more crazy than the Absolute Pepper vodka that Kurt accidentally put in his Red Bull and Vodka (yuck).   Classic moment, when kyle and matt attempt to break dance and end up falling over trying to do one-handed handstands. As matt picked himself off the floor I took a shot that makes him look like a monkey walking around with the aid of his knuckles. You'll see it on the link.   Laterz Crew, it was good to see you again. -Rick

      in the past few weeks , all the weather we've been having is  RAIN . I miss the last year's summer when it was so fucking hot I wanted winter to come by really quick. Luckily last night, it was a nice night that ended up having simon drooling in sam's car and him  yelling out " hollar " to like 15 chicks in  ONE  taxi cab, and having them flicking him off. good work simon! We went to see Scott Henry (ole buzz resident) to spin for 1 hour = 10 bucks admission (sucks)...and left to go get some pizza mart pizza. yummmmmmy. im gonna end the story here now im tired.......

        ok im back to blogging. ive gotten a few emails of people wondering what the hell ive been up to and now that lukas is here. i dont have any time for anyone. ok maybe lucky  you  . but tonight while during commerical breaks, playing snake 2 on my cell phone (my high score is 500 something, crap score, simon / sanh has high ranking scores). I always love watching dateline or 20/20 stuff on things they do, like take it tonight, it was about " reality dating " and it remind me of some of my single friends (yes you know you are out there). On dateline they were talking about this bar place, in NYC called  urlLink Remote Lounge  Here's what it is --->    a revolutionary new concept in   nightlife entertainment:   >> live video feeds   >> controllable cameras   >> interactive digital art   >> tasty cocktails and snacks  even better, tuesday nights plays drum n' bass / breaks !  . Ok we are def making a nyc trip this summer for this. the concept of this bar is like 70 mini cameras all over the bar, and you can call the person you see on screen, and they see you. Of course, they might not like you (HIDE) or they might actually like you. I thought it was cool, makes it easier for the shy guys out there ( YES YOU ). but click on the site and its pretty cool. All I can do in that bar is help the guys find girls. Trip # 2 to NYC here we come....

      tonight is the night......yes. we're getting a group to go to atlantic city tonight for some gambling and  free drinks  (more so on the drinks, i doubt about winning). Last night we headed out to Adams Morgan for some bar hopping, I only had one drink (go figure) because I had drinks @ the house (a lot cheaper). and out of 8-9 people, i think everyone was drunk (except for the drivers). Please note, dont let Psymon sleep on your bed because why? He will SLEEP there forever. It was about 4am, and he slept on the bed, and wouldnt get off. Even by saying " hey simon, im going to bed, can you get off " . He would say " whhyyyyyyyy " then go back to bed, so Atalie had to remove him off the bed, by dragging. thanks. and we tried to tie his laces together but he knew what was up. damn.  Another rainy day, Another crappy day. Another road trip.   whats your fave numbers?

      so i havent posted pictures in a long time, and i was looking at old pictures of me , being, what else = DRUNK. those were the days. every fucking weekend, i would just get drunk and wasted and do it over again the following weekend. Counting the days at work and dreading each hour til it was friday, and its kinda funny to look at this one, just look at my expression.   dinner tomm at jordans, woo hoo, finally the famous " crab soup " that ive heard from many people, great stories, it better be good sam.     note i had a few shots and beers in me at that time, but yet that time was early, like a hour into the party. ahhh memories...i was dying that night, praying to god, but wait, i dont believe in god.

      1 week turns to 2 weeks , 2 weeks turn to 4 weeks...  so its been the 1st week that luke has been gone, ok maybe mid-week now. He's in chicago right now, comes back for next week, then hes off to minnesota for a week, comes back for the weekend and then gone for another 2 weeks  straight . Its kinda good though, for us to save money during the weekdays because we love to spend $. Also, for me to focus on looking for a place for us. I have exactly a month so wish me luck guys.   Another side note, my friend Scott is also looking for a place and if he cant find a place, hes heading to NYC or CA. I wish i could do that, just leave like him, but wait , I have luke. Whatever choice you make, I'll be behind you. Def, throw you a party. Mikey is leaving for NYC in the matter of weeks.   Found another band, Brand New , #5 of their album is a good song, found it through mtv. MAE is also good, from va beach. I def need to get a dig cam (ive had too many and sold too manY) and post some pics...

      shopping....   @ tysons, i saw the saddest thing.   luke always makes these " inside jokes " with me, when he sees a asian girl with a mechang guy...and be like " look Thy, its us " , and i just laugh at him. well i saw this couple. Older asian lady, with this young white guy, and im thinking, luke hasnt said a thing to me about it...then i look behind the lady, and shes like in handcuffs (hecths), and her daughter (she look like 15 years old) was in handcuffs too. And I heard from the cop/security guy (which was undercover, very well, he look like a bum), asking " I cant believe you are stealing with your daughther, thats just sad "......  people are nuts to do that, steal with their kids. i wasnt too happy with it and i felt bad for the lady b/c of course she was asian, older lady too, and shes helping stealing with her daughter. just sad ill say. but she deserves it, teach them a lesson. i know stealing at malls is a harder crime now, thats just embrassing too to watch.

      entertainment for everyone....go ahead and laugh...  so i was throwing shit away and saw some of my highschool memories...ah highschool, i remember one time, my senior year @ Edison HS. I almost didnt graduate, well or so, i was stressing out that I wasn't going to graduate. Why you ask? Well maybe because I skipped so many times in my world history class, that I got a F for one of the semesters. It was bad. No one can see me " skip " class, but I did it so much I got a fucking F for it and I got Saturday detention. I know I can laugh now but I was so stressing out that I wouldnt' graduate because of that stupid class that I always took naps in. ALWAYS. When the teacher would play a movie about history, etc. I would just sleep through the whole thing. Ah, highschool. I miss it.   This was ME. 10th grader !  CLASS of 97 BABY.  our slogan "  thank heaven its 97 !! "

      to goes out to mainly to one person. i wont tell who you are haha  Spearheading the emo brigade, Dashboard Confessional tackle such themes as relationships and love, thanks to singer/songwriter Chris Carrabba's poignant tunes. A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar is the sound of a young artist coming into his own. The record begins with "Hands Down," a breathless sprint through the moonlit memories of young love. As the album progresses, Carrabba's storytelling ability shines and the rest is surprising in its diversity. "I wrote my last album in two weeks when I was in a dark place," he says, "I wrote this one over a year and a half. I guess some people are always going to brand me as 'the sad guy,' but that's just not me. Everyone has bad periods in their lives. This record is about where I've been, certainly, but it's also about where I'm going and what I'm becoming." Stream the entire album a week before it hits stores with The Leak and join the emo club, if the spirit moves you.  yes,  urlLink dashboard's  new cd is coming out  and we can listen to their  WHOLE  album, yes whole...before it comes out in about 2 weeks. 8/4 is when we can at  urlLink here   just to let you know and again you know who you are

      maybe im lazy to post or maybe its just i dont feel like sharing any thoughts to the world of the internet...  im trying - im trying ... my best ...    i went to best buy today and bought myself a cd. i thought its been awhile since ive bought an actually " cd " ...so what was on the top of my list ?  The Postal Service . The funny thing is that I even downloaded most of the album on the net too. Maybe I thought I needed to buy their cd, just because I became a fan. I've been on this " indie" music kick lately....I'm sick of listening to the radio (even though i have to @ work). Music Media sucks. Just trying to make that  dolla bill.    im out.
