      Have been wondering about including in the count overseas journalists blogging from Iraq. My original intention was to record the *new* blogs of people just beginning to exercise their opinions internationally.    Not quite sure what my decision is on this yet. Maybe, if i find more journalists blogs i will begin another heading for them ~ as with  Some Soldiers Blogs .  At the moment i'm only tallying the blogs in the  Iraq Blogs  links.

      Brewing for quite some time, emigre senses an explosion of noise on the verge of eruption...the blogstorm is reaching Iraq. One at a time, typists begin to whisper at keyboards, screens begin to briefly flare.  If you listen you can hear these voices, the anguish, the technical difficulties, and voices of support, of debate, from around the world.  I do not believe that military might has bought these people freedom of speech, and i wonder that this may have happened eventually anyway, in a different perhaps more desperate and fearful way, under the regime of Saddam.   I do not verify the sources of these blogs. I do not agree with or even endorse the content. I simply count.  I am aware that at this point these are also the voices of people who have internet access, and that there must be many people in Iraq just struggling to survive who have not the means or even the inclination to write.   I am not counting soldiers blogs, although links to many of these can be found in Iraq blogs. Soldiers blogs are another phenomena in themselves, and i think there are many more then i could even begin to count alone.  I have read only a few of these - my impression overwhelmingly is of a lost people, some quite clear - they aim only to get back to normality, others confused and dealing with contradictions that i would wish on no-one.  Soldiers and military blogs seem to be two distinctly different types. The military blog strikes one immediately as a morale boosting propaganda campaign, while soldiers blogs are more like lone voices in the dark. Some of the most forthright anti-war sentiments are voiced in soldiers blogs. I would be unsurprised if over time more blogs from disenchanted ex-service people appear.

      This brief trans-explanation of  Rafedain  (a blog that  Iraq Blog Count  recently linked) bought to you by  urlLink Ihath.  Thanks  Ihath .    urlLink Rafedain  Is an Arabic blog like news feed. It reports news about and from Iraq. The tone is very journalistic. For example (Today AL-Hakeem made 5 demands from the UN, In a news conference held at x Al Hakeem reported that he is drafting ...) you get the picture. Non of the news items quotes a source nor is their an about me to tell us who the people behind it are. A fyi fact, rafedain means the two tributaries or two rivers. Iraq is frequently called "belad al rafedain" the country of the two rivers. A reference to the Tigris and Euphrates.

      Have you ever been in a strange city, walking about quietly, maybe you are searching for something but you don't really know what? Everything looks like cities usually do, buildings, more buildings, concrete, more concrete, maybe some brick and tarmac. You turn down an ordinary looking street, for no reason, walk to the end of it, and suddenly, you have just walked into the middle of one of the most vibrant blocks you have ever seen and were never expecting.  This is what i found...    urlLink This is the ordinary street i turned down...   And this was at the end of it....   urlLink Iraqipress.com  A newspaper?   urlLink Iraqipapers.com  More newspapers?   urlLink Iraq Top 1000    urlLink Yalla Ya Arab  yalla ya, an Arabic chat site?   urlLink Anbaar.net  Info & documentation (A journalists blog?).    urlLink Iraq 4 All  Groovy kitsch song (State Approved Camp?)   urlLink Iraqi Art  This looks really cool...   urlLink Absso.com  No idea what's going on here, looks like a bunch of articles, one on a captured Hussein, and some on art, and book reviews? Well this one looks like its about an  urlLink artist  anyway.   urlLink Iraq4us.com  Discussion/forum?   urlLink Arab International.com  Computers, general.   urlLink Wikalah.net  Religion? (sorry, my ignorance makes me cringe, i haven't a religious bone in my body).   urlLink Kadhem AlSaher Marina Pictures 2003  your guess is as good as mine?   urlLink Dr. Ali Zayni  This is too good! You have gotta click on his sculpture gallery (and his Dental Center). (Interesting, some of the sculpture reminds me a bit of Kathe Kollwitz and Ernst Barlach, both artists who practiced under regimes of oppression in the early mid 20th century, come to think of it the work of that other artist on the Absso.com page reminds me of the german expressionists too).   urlLink Serwan.com  Very very cool. An artists site. Definately some expressionist inspiration going on here, Blaue Reiter and even something Klimptish?  Sorry i have no idea what most of these are about or who publishes them, so i hope i'm not linking to anything offensive, and hope that i've not offended anyone i've linked to. I started trying to figure them out by the pictures, and even wondered if i should ask someone else what they meant, in the end i threw away caution and just decided to link them anyway.  I think all of these are Iraq sites, I think most are in Arabic, but some may be Persian? For all i know some of these could be censor controlled propaganda. Right now i really really really wish the babble fish spoke Arabic or Persian. If you can understand any of these i am soooo envious!   urlLink Rafedain  This looks like a blog, and that looks like a map of Iraq in the corner - i'm counting it.   urlLink Tafteh.ws  This looks like a blog too, but i can't figure out the origin, so alas, i shan't count it - unless i learn where its from/who publishes it.    Update from Ihath, for those who don't read/speak Persian, this blog is in Persian. It seems it may not be from Iraq, although this is still unconfirmed     urlLink Saberi.Persianblog.com  A blog i guess too, in Persian? Again my ignorance precludes me from knowing who or where it's from. The tree pic-story is curious...   Update from Ihath, for those who don't read/speak Persian, this blog also is in Persian. It seems it may not be from Iraq, although this is still unconfirmed.     New Today:1 Total: 25

      (to the person who mentioned  Iraq The Model  - its between  Live From Dallas  and  Wildfire  (counted on 19 Nov) maybe things need to be linked in Alphabetical order so its easier to find though, up to now i've just been adding links one after the other as i happen across them. I will have a think about this, if it still seems like a good idea i may alphabetise.  If anyone actually is using this as a directory, then feel free to shout if you think alphabetical links would be useful or not).

If you ever see one of these stray thoughts be prepared for it to later disappear... think of these posts as fleeting moments of consciousness passing across the monitor.

      After reading recent discussion by some Iraq bloggers re future implications for women in Iraq, i have done some other reading and found this  urlLink A Thermodynamic Interpretation of History; Chapter 4 The Liberation of Women  which is an interesting read if you take the time.    Notes; The article fails to mention that the point of stasis desired by the nation state is the point at which all adults are independent enough to have their own incomes and so be able to consume sufficiently to keep the economy afloat, but to also be dependent enough on each other to raise children, for children are both future consumers and also current valuable pressure points for marketers of consumable goods.  The article also fails to mention that once women have attained their happy autonomy and are working and dating as "free floating sharks" they have less time to reproduce. So, the population begins to decline, in turn meaning there are less consumers, in turn meaning less is consumed, in turn threatening profits, in turn threatening the survival of capitalism/ the nation state. So, capitalism/ the nation state develops into a sequence of fluctuating degrees of freedom, where freedom is let out on a leash where desirable and pulled back to the kennel when not.     But, the future need not be grim, so long as people become aware of the forces that are shaping their lives there is also the chance to in turn shape those forces to ones own advantage.

Perhaps if there were more visitors or if anyone showed particular concern about the provision of a more committed comments facility, then Iraq Blog Count would look into other alternatives.  In fact, guess what, i think i'll hold a referendum about it.   Those in favour of better comments facilities please say Aye, those opposed, you can say Nay.

      Iraq Blog Count is bored. There are no new Iraq blogs to count, or maybe there are but they are way of the radar and exist in a dimension entirely of their own, which  nobody  else ( nobody  = Emigre, seeing as Emigre is a nobody) knows about.  There are no new Iraq blogs to count. Nearly even cheated and counted a Kurdish blog;  urlLink Kurdo's World  but managed to exercise restraint and instead dealt with boredom by pestering Kurdo in his comments, fortunately  Kurdo seems to possess a relatively peaceable and chatty persona  and didn't seem to mind. Maybe if there were more Kurd'o blogs i could start a Kurdistan Blog Count. Anyway, if you're looking for more variety and interested in the bigger picture, pop along to  urlLink Kurdo's World  if you haven't already.  In the meantime (there is quite a lot of it - meantime, at the moment, as there are no new Iraq blogs to count) found this description of Greek philosophy by some guy called Martin West;   Early Greek philosophy was not a single vessel which a succession of pilots briefly commanded and tried to steer towards an agreed destination, one tacking one way, the next altering course in the light of its own perceptions. It was more like a flotilla of small craft whose navigators did not start from the same point or at the same time, nor all aim for the same goal; some went in groups, some were influenced by the movements of others, some traveled out of sight of each other.   "A flotilla of small craft", i like it, it reminds me of blogging.  Philosophic digression;  if all bodies are nobodies, and Emigre is a nobody, does that make Emigre everybody? Ok, so there are no new Iraq Blogs to count and Iraq Blog Count is filling in space. Is that still too obscure? well, how about this then, there are too few Iraq bloggers. (and no, i'm not one of them).

      Re Raeds post  Jan 22 2004 ;  urlLink Where is Raed.    A reminder that these people have been through hell with the constant uncertainty and destruction inherent in having ones local cities and towns pelted by bombs. A reminder that some of these people also are privileged to little pieces of regular hell via email and comments facilities.   A reminder that these too few people have still managed to maintain enough heart to bring views, gossip and regular discussion to the rest of the world, without being paid for it - absolutely, in fact, for free. Absolutely, in fact, for the sake of freedom itself - at least in an effort to remind us that there still is such a thing, even if under duress.  And at a  cost, a cost to themselves, to their private lives, identities, and invariably to their bank balances - for blogging, though an exercise in freedom of speech, is not actually a toll free exercise in itself.   Raeds post, a reminder that all bloggers are only human and that most humans crave only to get on with life with as little trouble as possible,  preferably without hatemail.  So, here's to all Iraq bloggers, to all bloggers, to Raed, to Winston Smith, to Anne Frank, a post in respect, a post for the sake of a post, a post without any new Iraq blogs to count, a post, in memoriam, to freedom of speech.

Maybe Osama could peel the onions. Make food not missiles, fight it out in the pantry if need be - but only with the plastic cutlery, thanks.   Meanwhile Iraq Blog Count has been too slack and has not found any new blogs to count. So, if you're stopping by why don't ya go get yourself a snack and then go visit these other more motivated, more interesting, more on the edge, more informative, more much very good whatmorecouldyouaskfor more;   urlLink Baghdad Burning  she rocks   urlLink Ihath  she rolls (and writes letters)   urlLink A Family In Baghdad  Faiza moves forward with courage   urlLink Where is Raed  anything u like, it is here, including with *new improved* Raed, well actually not really, he is just the same as usual, which is charming in itself - quote:  Mirror mirror on the wall, who’s the most irresponsible of them all?  unquote Raed.  Which reminds me of something else i saw today;  urlLink Snow White and the Madness of Truth The director of the museum has the final say;  "You can have your own view of what this piece of art is all about, but it is never, never allowed to use violence and it is never allowed to try to silence the artist," he said.     urlLink Healing Iraq  another link never hurt noone   urlLink Live from Dallas  Fayrouz is rightfully miffed when she gets fined for not voting, and still has faith in a land where she can chose between two completely similiar demonarchies.   (A demonarchy is a cross between a democracy and a monarchy, it is where you can chose between parties that have become family affairs. A bit like being able to chose which royal family you like best, a bit like a reality game show, only less real. Both families will make sure before elections that they are seen to attend completely different convivial occasions but after elected will do their damnedest to be invited to the same parties with the richest hosts and best after dinner perks. A demonarchy is also the name used to refer to the elected party, as after elections all other parties are almost totally forgotten till the next election. A demonarchy likes at all times to maintain a semblance of order and, even though it makes up its own rules as it goes along, has nothing to do with anarchy).  and now... if you haven't already... why don't ya go exercise your online democratic (ha, democracy, u had forgotten what that was, no? well just when u began to think it was a figment of your imagination) ...here it is...   urlLink *VOTE*  for your fav blog.

      Someone in the shoutbox has mentioned Iraqs mass graves. Iraq Blog Count did a search and has found it necessary to publish several links, as there is no single website to cover this subject in its entirety satisfactorily.  These links are hoped to provide a view of an emotive issue which so far has been sparsely documented, bearing in mind this is a human issue of depth which has barely yet been exhumed, and bearing in mind that a few links in a blog can hardly pretend to be definitive. These graves are matters of peoples personal grief, deserving of respect and dignity. These graves are also a public affair in that they are the graves of people buried en mass, and in that they have been unearthed at a time when the media spotlight is held full in the faces of their relatives.  I have always had a personal aversion to the camera held in the face of grief, and for that reason have had a think before linking to this first site: so if you click on this site let it be in respect for peoples mourning and less in morbid curiosity;  urlLink The Mass Graves    urlLink Baghdad survey    urlLink Kurdistan Observer  Jun 13 2003   urlLink Middle East Times  Sept 12 2003   urlLink PR Media and International Speakers  Nov 9 2003 and the same article at  urlLink USA Today  11/08/2003 and also at  urlLink Redding.com  Nov 9 2003   urlLink Last Superpower.net  Nov 9 2003   urlLink Wanniski  Dec 14 2003   As i said this is an emotive issue and documentation has barely begun. Most of these links are opinion based. It appears so far that these graves date to three main periods, the most recent being the 1991 Gulf war. It appears that a number of these sites are war graves.

       It must be a peace without victory. Only a peace between equals can last: only a peace, the very principle of which is equality, and a common participation in a common benefit. Woodrow Wilson Jan 22 1917  The people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty. Jefferson 1787  You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.

Have added this blog to  a new section here called  Humanitarian Iraq Blogs , am trying to think of a better name for this section but that will do for now.   Notes;  1. New links and sections are added to the bottom in the sidebar, this way it is possible to view links chronologically without having to read through all the archives to find out when they were added. I am observing that this method seems to be reflecting a progression of events as they unfold.  2. The reference links have been divided into two sections now;  Reference  and  Online Culture , to make things easier to read.

I must urge you towards greater creativity with your titles, as i am thinking of taking up spam poetry.  (wouldn't it be ironic if this ends up in your junkmail)  sincerely  IBC

       urlLink Brooklyn to Baghdad  a tourist in Iraq, yep really.

Its influence on the shaping of international relations is absolutely incalculable. But America is a large country, and its people have so far not shown much interest in great international problems, among which the problem of disarmament occupies first place today. This must be changed, if only in America's own interest. The last war has shown that there are no longer any barriers between the continents and that the destinies of all countries are closely interwoven. The people of this country must realize that they have a great responsibility in the sphere of international politics. The part of passive spectator is unworthy of this country and is bound in the end to lead to disaster all round."    if you visit his blog you might be surprised (i was) to learn when this statement was made, and by whom.

      Iraq Blog Count has very rightly been taken to task for making provocative statements.  The issue is this, should bloggers who desire recognition as Kurdistan bloggers be counted as Iraq blogs or not? This is, believe it or not, part of an issue Iraq blog count crops up against often, and inevitably ends up making a vague decision about guided only by a sort of vague instinct. For instance, on discovering Soldiers blogs:   - Oh no! what to do! I hadn't expected soldiers to be blogging, well i can't ignore them, but to begin counting them, - there are thousands of soldiers deployed all over the world right now - where could it possibly end!   Or on linking journalists blogs:   - is G's blog an Iraq blog or a journo blog? Well, technically, maybe a journo, but on the other hand, Salam & Raed and G were sort of Iraq blog catalysts, for a time Salam and G seemed to be the  only  Iraq bloggers - Iraq Blog Count couldn't just ditch G's blogs when more showed up - it'd be like starting to count backwards.   And then, those peaceworkers blogs - what of those bloggers? They are blogging one minute from New York or who knows where, and the next from Jordan or Baghdad - where do they fit the picture? Not to mention civil affairs, "Peace Corps" reconstruction workers who are activated from army reserves. Then there was that guy who is sounding very British and seems to have British parents, but seems he was born in Iraq (or at least spent his childhood there) and is blogging about Iraq from the UK. And those Iraqis who are blogging from Dallas and from Canada! These are just a few examples , but you get the picture. Yeeek, how does one deal with all this! People! You are all just being so individualist! So diverse! So, so, rich and varieteous and mixed up, and, well, so human really.  Well, for a while Iraq Blog count got away with things, "Iraq" in the end just seemed to sum it all up (after of course mild title-agony; Iraq or Iraqi Blog Count? Blogs or Bloggers?) And then, just when things looked like sorting themselves out, uh-oh, some guys show up blogging from Kurdistan! What? Is that like Northern Iraq? Or is it Kurdistan, a state? Or is it some kind of new virtual territory in the Blogosphere? Now what is a blog counter to do! To count as Iraq? Would that be ignoring the issue? To not mention at all? Well, that'd be ignoring an issue too, and the principle here has always been to be inclusive, to attempt the bigger picture, to be peaceable, and to also face challenge.  So, eventually, a clumsy decision was made and a brief post probably lacking in tact and diplomacy published. Well, that post is still there - just down below, to remind everyone (and me) of my human failings and inept use of discretion. Iraq Blog Count still is a little unsure how to resolve this, and apologises to anyone who may have been offended.   Essentially Iraq Blog Count operates on the premise that bloggers support each other, and support each others differences, especially during these times. As the number of Iraq bloggers increases (small increase as it is so far) so increases the need to keep some record of who is blogging. For, among other things, knowing who is blogging is also knowing who stops, and if they are ok.  So please, if you have something to say about this, email  urlLink Iraq Blog Count  with your advise/thoughts/feedback. Maybe need to get comments here also (which is another issue that has been delayed).  Well, thats enough controversy for this week. Did have a couple of other contentious posts in the drawer, but just feeling the way here and not sure this is the place for them.

      Just noticed  urlLink Iraqi Lady  in the links over at  urlLink Hammorabi.   Iraqi Lady  is worth clicking around, there are a range of sites there, from  urlLink Artist's  and  urlLink Writer's  to  urlLink Princess's  and  urlLink Queen's.  Some of these sites are multilingual, so if you are language deficient (like me) you'll be happy to find, with a bit of a look about, some english and also soothing visuals if you can't read the script.   Iraqi Lady  also has a range of  urlLink news links,  from Arabic CNN & BBC to Aljazeera.    urlLink Iraqi Forum for Democracy  is also worth checking.    Iraqi Lady  is now in the sidebar Online Culture links, and  Iraqi Forum for Democracy  in the reference links if you're looking for them later on.

      Ok, this is a bit off topic, but it is scandalous and has implications for all bloggers, and also for many who don't blog.   There is an outrageous suggestion that has been floating around for a while, and seems to have resurfaced after the recent Mydoom episode - that of  urlLink paying to send email.  The spin is that charging to send email will cut down on spam, and that spammers will be turned off spamming if even 1 cent were charged per sent email. This is a really quite ridiculous assertion. Old-fashioned paper mail costs almost a dollar to send including stamp and envelope plus ink, paper etc - and our good old fashioned letter boxes are still laden with junkmail. Paying to send junkmail does not deter the sender.   If one were to examine the contents of ones oldfashionedpapermail letter box one would probably find a good deal of junk mail from supermarkets, discount warehouses and fastfood outlets. What does this suggest to me? This suggests to me that the sender/s own a chain/s of stores and certainly have the available capital to print copious amounts of glossy four colour, if tacky, brochures. The postage cost is no deterrent.    I once house shared with someone who actually LIKed reading junkmail, she would sit down with a cuppa and laugh at it all, you know, the vibrating pillows and the face massagers shaped just like - well never mind, the point is that it didn't annoy her that much. And spam doesn't annoy me that much either. In fact, some people even compose  urlLink poetry  from spam... even spammers themselves are reportedly becoming, increasingly,  urlLink poetic.   And for those who are annoyed by junkmail; spam, like paper junkmail, can be filtered from an inbox by the e-quivalent of those "No Junkmail" stickers that some people used to stick on their boxes.    Charging for email is a moneymaking scam and more revolting in its sales pitch then spam itself.  It is another attempt to control and censor virtualspace with money, in line with recent attempts to charge for Linux and to sue for free music downloading.    I am incensed.

      On this day in 2003   urlLink March 20 2003   On this day last year in the morning, before leaving home, I kneel in front of the radio before switching it off, as I hear that flights have left I try to mutter "you bastards" under my breath but instead my mouth stretches into an involuntary sob and tears take my face by surprise. I go to work feeling shattered. On this day last year everyone is quiet, but for the sound of news presenters and the silent patter of millions of hits on web news sites.  Everyone, everywhere, in every country, city, town and offbeat track is waiting. Some are waiting for their cue. Demonstrations have been organised to synchronise with the day the first bombs fall on Iraq. In something of a ripple effect, a bomb drops on Baghdad and thousands of placards flap across the globe, like butterflies, like migratory birds preparing to take leave, an evacuation of the soul.  On this day last year rationality deserts us, all.   urlLink Radio  in Iraq, about this time last year.

The day the UN resolution is abandoned a stealthy silence falls, an unreality bomb drops on the western world. Most of us become small mammalian creatures scuttling towards our small securities, our burrows.  On this day last year, in a southern hemisphere city.

      On this day in 2003   urlLink March 15 2003   Coalition drops nearly a million leaflets. See  urlLink leaflets.  Some of the leaflets contain messages  urlLink "used to inform Iraqi people about United Nations Security Council resolutions".

       Iraq The Model , which dedicates itself to publishing new points of view about the future of Iraq, has published a sobering post exploring that issue close to all our hearts - the future of the earth.  urlLink  A luxury that we cannot afford  Ali talks about the development of nuclear weapons, noting that in chess:  making...the safest move is the shortest way to lose .   Mindful that the analogy to a game of chess is an uncomfortable one, what then is the riskiest move? In chess the object is to capture an opponents most powerful piece, the ideal outcome checkmate rather then stalemate. In our world none of us desire to be either wiped off the board nor suspended in limbo, and some of us seek a solution whereby all chess pieces remain free and on board - in essence an entirely new game. Apart from the implications of such an analogy perhaps the riskiest move, where nuclear arms are concerned, would be for every country to stop pursuing nuclear war technology and to dismantle all the nuclear arms that they already possess. This is extremely risky for all countries involved because each is afraid that nobody else is brave enough to follow suit and some even argue that they do not know how to safely undo what they have done.   If this move could be achieved, it would be the best move humanity has ever made in declaring trust and peace in one another. It will be a long time before people will trust each other enough to do this, but it is inevitable if not in our lifetime. If we do not make this move the risk of nuclear accident can only increase. Whether these weapons are ever deployed intentionally or not, the production of arms is a form of calculated madness and we can not expect madness to always be able to contain itself.

      Trying out a feature provided by  urlLink blogrolling.  If you scroll all the way down the bottom of the sidebar ( all  the way down the very bottom, past the babble fish and the very quiet shoutbox) you will see the new blogrolling-powered-links, which are essentially all the blogs that have been linked here so far. The ones that have been published in the last 48 hours will have a small orange piece of text saying  new post  beneath them.  Objective; to help read through every single blog all the time to see if there are any new posts/more new Iraq blogs.  Update: well the "new post" text worked in orange when i tested it, but now it seems to be showing up in black (which isn't so readable against dark blue, damnit, does that mean the colour scheme has to change all over again? and just when the decore was looking so optimistic)  Later update: after blogrolling links have been visited they turn orange and indigo, groovy hey (go on, click one, u know u want to try it) yalla, stop fiddling now (that is, i must stop fiddling now).

      US forces prepare to leave Fallujah after a deal is arranged for a new Fallujah Protective Army to replace US marines. The Fallujah Protective Army is comprised of former Iraqi soldiers, who were employed by the former Baathist regime, and will be under the command of a General Salah.  A Lt.-Gen. Salah Abboud al-Jabouri is known to have  urlLink served as governor of Anbar province under Saddam and was a senior commander in Saddam's military.   The Fallujah Protective Army is expected to keep Fallujan insurgents in check.   urlLink Back to Iraq  has as comprehensive a post as any other news outlet, best i read.  Footnotes  1). US administrative references to armed opposition has shifted from phrases implicating the former Baath party; "remnants of Baathist Regime" to; "Insurgents". Previous ascertains that fighting was occurring between (liberating) US forces and (resisting) remnants of Saddam's army are now thrown into a questionable gloom. Former members of Saddam's army have now been recruited to engage in battle with, um, former members of Saddam's army.  2). Some Iraq bloggers earlier this week have already expressed reservations re re-baathification.  3). Reasons for going to war. Checklist.  ~  WMD; none found, so far. ~  Regime change; regime re-installation, as of April 2004, commencing Fallujah. ~  War on Terror; very successful, top marks, war now in full swing.  Update;   urlLink war now in full swing.  More  urlLink headlines.   4). Flag ~ flagging.  5). Iraqi POW's ~ can of worms. Prediction; will try to find person with can-opener and hold accountable for as many PR failures as possible.  6). Not a very good month.

      Apologies in advance, difficult to find something positive this week.  Disturbing events at Abu Ghraib Prison (treatment of POW's);  urlLink ~ The Guardian  	  urlLink ~ Ireland Online   urlLink ~ CNN 	  (No photo's included in these links, saw pictures in a local paper today, felt ill. Not looking for photo's to link too, you've probably already seen them).   Update;    Photographs of UK forces torturing prisoners have now also been published by the Mirror. It is worrying that Amnesty International has been documenting cases of mistreatment for some time, but it is only now that photographs have surfaced that the claims are taken seriously. It is disturbing to think that if these images had never been revealed this may have become just another cover-up. How many other incidences throughout history are there that nobody knows about and probably never will, simply because a camera wasn't handy at the time.   This from the Guardian, 2 May;  urlLink It was not, says the Mirror's editor Piers Morgan, an easy story to run even though he immediately knew he had a scoop when the photographs came across his desk more than a week ago... Morgan himself was worried about the effect of running such disturbing images in a paper known for its opposition to the war. He knew that no one else had the pictures. They had been given to the paper by one of the soldiers involved in the attack, which happened several months ago. His mind was made up when pictures of American atrocities against Iraqi captives were televised around the world on Thursday.    A line in the Sunday Herald 2 May mentions other recorded images of abuse,  urlLink According to the British soldiers, the military police have found a video of prisoners being thrown from a bridge,  echoing a similar account from Zeyad  urlLink Jan 8 2004.   The same article also reports that civilian contractors were hired to conduct interrogations;  urlLink No civilians, however, are facing charges as military law does not apply to them.   Colonel Jill Morgenthaler, from CentCom, said that one civilian contractor was accused along with six soldiers of mistreating prisoners. However, it was left to the contractor to “deal with him”. One civilian interrogator told army investigators that he had “unintentionally” broken several tables during interrogations as he was trying to “fear-up” detainees. Another excerpt from the same article;  urlLink One of the US soldiers facing court martial is reservist Staff Sergeant Chip Frederick – ... In letters and e-mails home, he wrote: “Military intelligence has encouraged and told us "Great job". He added: “They usually don’t allow others to watch them interrogate. But since they like the way I run the prison, they have made an exception … We help getting [the PoWs] to talk with the way we handle them … We’ve had a very high rate with our style of getting them to break. They usually end up breaking within hours.”  Frederick said prisoners were made to live in cramped windowless cells with no clothes, running water or toilet for up to three days. Others were held for 60 days before interrogation. He said one prisoner with a mental health condition was “shot with non-lethal rounds”. An interrogator told soldiers to “stress one prisoner out as much as possible [as] he wanted to talk to him the next day”. Frederick also said one prisoner was “stressed so bad that the man passed away”. Prisoners were covered in lice and some had tuberculosis. None were allowed to pray. Frederick said his commander sanctioned all this.  Quote from ex-US Marine Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan;  urlLink “We went to Iraq to stop things like this from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage … If we don’t tell this story, these kind of things will continue, and we’ll end up getting paid back 100 or 1000 times over.”

      It is not unusual for a company that perceives its image to be failing to choose to redesign its logo. While there is nothing especially wrong with a new design itself, it is the timing and the band-aid approach with which it is applied that perhaps attracts most criticism. Such a small blue and white bandage, to staunch such deep wounds.  It is not unusual that a designer might find, in redesigning a company logo, that it is not in fact the original logo itself which is at fault. Failing image is usually tied to deeper failings within a company, and faltering public opinion generally rests on experience as a customer rather then the letterhead printed on the latest monthly bill.  If belief were not already suspended it might be astonishing to see a multi billion dollar industry, which runs an entire nation of states, making such an old, common, mistake as attempting to salvage reputation by slapping a new company sticker on a new product.   urlLink ~ Flag   urlLink ~ Four previous Iraq flags.

      Faiza writes about the experiences of some people who fled to Baghdad from Fallujah this month. If you haven't already read it, here is the link... She begins;  urlLink I thought to meet them and listen to what they are saying, and write it here. I realized that the profession of journalism needs a tough heart to listen to tragic stories - and then smile and write them in a calm way, to write the truth.   Well, it seems Faiza gritted her teeth and toughened her heart and wrote what she heard; the confusion, the shock, the dusty, grimy, day to day survival that nobody seems to want to know about, because it is so unfortunately common. There is a sense of the relief that these women might have felt in finally telling their story to someone.  Zeyad's opinion of the  urlLink new flag  is probably shared by  urlLink Riverbend.   Ays reports roads to  urlLink Al-Aadamiah neighborhood north of Baghdad  are blocked, some are expecting "bad news", Ays says he hopes it is just rumours and that it may be only checkpoints.   Omar notices news in the Al-Sabah newspaper;  urlLink "a local armed group confronts Al-Sadr militia” I must admit that I felt relieved at first. At last, some Iraqi civilians took it upon themselves to fight the terrorists. But after a minute of thinking, this question came to my mind; is this what we want to see, Iraqi civilians carry arms to fight the thugs?

      CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll shows  urlLink conflicted feelings among Iraqis over the war and its impact...  ... Most interviews were done between March 22 and April 9 -- before the latest flare-up of violence... Iraqi interviewers conducted face-to-face surveys with 3,444 adults in Arabic and Kurdish in respondents' homes. The poll covered urban and rural areas throughout Iraq, representing about 93 percent of the population. It has a sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points... 53 percent said they would feel less safe if the U.S.-led coalition left immediately. About half as many -- 28 percent -- said they would feel more safe. Sixty-nine percent said they or their families would be in danger if they were seen cooperating with the coalition... Two-thirds -- 67 percent -- said troops were not trying at all to keep ordinary Iraqis from being killed in exchanges of gunfire, while 18 percent said the Americans were trying only a little and 11 percent said they were trying a lot... Seventy-one percent surveyed said they saw troops mostly as occupiers, while 19 percent said they viewed them as liberators. Asked how they viewed troops at the time of the invasion a year ago, the respondents were split, with 43 percent saying they saw the coalition forces as occupiers and another 43 percent saying they considered them liberators at the time...  ~ Background info; how the poll was  urlLink conducted.  The sample was randomly selected. About 2% refused to participate, implying that an astounding 98% took part. Translation; poll's accuracy is probably very good.   New York Times/CBS News Poll concludes US  urlLink Support for War Is Down Sharply  ... Asked whether the United States had done the right thing in taking military action against Iraq, 47 percent of respondents said it had, down from 58 percent a month earlier and 63 percent in December, just after American forces captured Saddam Hussein. Forty-six percent said the United States should have stayed out of Iraq, up from 37 percent last month and 31 percent in December... The diminished public support for the war did not translate into any significant advantage for Mr. Bush's Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. The poll showed the two men remaining in a statistical dead heat... The poll, conducted from Friday to Tuesday, came during a month that has seen more American soldiers killed in Iraq than in any other month since the invasion 13 months ago. In the days before the poll was conducted, a Web site obtained and publicly released for the first time photographs of soldiers' coffins returning to the United States from Iraq... The poll questioned 1,042 people. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.   urlLink ~ How poll was done  more on  urlLink methodology.   Iraq Blog Count's conclusion; People in Iraq are becoming less happy with prolonged and increased levels of violence. People in the US are also growing unhappy with increased levels of violence.  War, unsurprisingly,  is not going down well with civilians right now, regardless of geographic location. The rhetoric that accompanies war may be keeping speech writers busy, but everyone else is wondering when we are going to begin seeing constructive positive change. Words alone are probably not going to cut it in the next round of election campaigns.

      Ok, the last post was about "News-Leak" or "News-Echo". Today's post looks at "News-Dub", that is, where the lips are moving but all other sources are saying something else.  So, we have for example Radio Free Europe reporting 28 April 2004 that  urlLink Fighting subsides in Iraq  with an excellent "News-Logic" quote from Brahimi; "Unless this standoff [in Al-Fallujah] -- and now this fighting -- is brought to a resolution through peaceful means, there is great risk of a very bloody confrontation".  So apart from bringing us such incisive observations as; if this war doesn't end soon, there is a great risk it will continue, a sync issue can also be detected.  While the articles title declares that "Fighting subsides" a quote in the body of text tells us that "Unless...this fighting -- is bought to a resolution..." suggesting that fighting has not subsided yet, and is in fact quite likely to continue.  At the same time most other news sources are headlining stories that support the continued fighting theme as deduced above; April 28 2004 The Star;  urlLink Insurgents killed as US hits Fallujah  Ottawa Citizen;  urlLink Ceasefire shattered, U.S. strikes Fallujah  and loads more urlLink  here.

      Alright, although sometimes bloggers are occasionally on top of the news and every once in a rare while scoop a story before other media, and even though they are even quite often up with the play, posting critique on stories of the day, that is not always the case. Here is an example of (largely volontary) web-media struggling to keep up with the enormous amount of constantly changing info out there. Sometimes there is a sense these things are later posted merely to keep a record of them, rather then to be current.   This report from  Voices in the Wilderness  mentioning refugees leaving Fallujah was published April 26, written several days earlier, April 23, and originally reported weeks earlier by various other sources;   April 26 2004;  urlLink Estimates of total refugees vary, but most reports suggest at least 60,000 Fallujans -- or about a quarter of the city's population -- have fled Fallujah for Baghdad and other cities...   April 23 2004;  urlLink same story as above, different website.   April 14 2004;  urlLink  As many as 60,000 - one fifth of the city - may have poured into Baghdad since Friday...   April 12 2004;  urlLink More than 60,000 women and children fled the city during a brief ceasefire on Friday but the US blocked any men of military age from leaving...   April 11 2004;  urlLink Lt. Col. Gregg Olson, who has overseen the military activity in Fallujah, said Saturday. "I like to think that the 60,000 people who left...   I call this type of publishing "news-leak". No, not the scandalous leaks that spring out of clandestine dealings and whisper "government intrigue, state secret" in your ear. No. These leaks are the slow spreading damp from old and warn out water mains, the mundane seepage from overburdened sewerage systems, the dull drip drip of news we may or may not have heard last week and frankly are not surprised by when we do hear it. These are the news items that websites with names like "Democracy Now" and "Christian Science Monitor" and "Occupation Watch" studiously, collect, collate and preserve, while the refugees dissolve into the landscape, absorbed by relatives and friends.   Update;  also known as "News-Echo".

      I don't think I'll be holding my breath for women's liberties in Iraq, thanks to US intervention, if Afghanistan is any indication.   It is two and a half years since W. Bush sent his storm troopers into the Afghan desert, seeking to deliver it's long suffering people from oppression. It is pure speculation of course, but being such well trained, culturally sensitive and liberating forces, it is not too much a stretch of the imagination to envisage troops showering the grateful women of Afghanistan with brochures declaring such liberating proclamations as; "Cast aside your Burqa's!" "Women of Afghanistan, walk free!" "Lady liberty, her torch is now yours! ... ok sorry, that last one was particularly bad taste.   Anyway, as it is, the only one who seems to be roaming around free without a burqa at the moment is Osama Bin Ladin, elusive and more freshfaced with every new video he releases. But that's beside the point. Unfortunately  urlLink this; "There is not a village in Farah where a young woman has not burned herself to death,"  is not at all beside the point. And nor is it beside the point that women in an Afghan province, so shortly after having discovered a means of expression through  urlLink radio,  are now again  urlLink banned  from performing on television and air. Radio becomes just another hollow voice echoing on the war waves - your country is free, here, have a radio station, listen to our propaganda instead. No, if life for  urlLink Afghani women  is anything to go by, I don't hold out that much hope for liberation in Iraq at all.  Bush's administration is in more trouble then it knows. Thought the anti war marches in Feb last year were big? Think again, Sunday's demonstration in Washington DC for Women's Lives has been estimated to be the  urlLink largest demonstration in American history.    There's a lot of ladies out there Dubya', and in comparison with your goverment's policy even a promiscuous philanderer like Clinton gets better lookin' everyday.

       Iraq Blog Report;   Iraq Hack has published  urlLink censored  material.  urlLink Banned images  available thanks to the tenacity of The Memory Hole, who obtained these photographs after filing a freedom of information act request. The original request was rejected but after the Memory Hole appealed the ruling was reversed. So I guess these images are not banned anymore, now.   Looks like Iraq the Model will be publishing  urlLink  photo's soon  too. (Enlightened times these. If the news isn't showing what you want to see, just file a request under the freedom of information act, or send a blogger a digital camera. Problem fixed, news by mail order).  Iraqi Expat has also obtained  urlLink images.    Hammorabi is impressed by neither re-baathification;  urlLink Getting the Baathists back is a fatal mistake and it will result in nothing but more credibility for those who stated that the US policy in Iraq is not democracy ...but something else  nor by Paul Bremer;  urlLink Democracy is not decrees and decrees are not freedom!  Hammorabi, keeping it real.  Majid is succinct;   urlLink -so, let’s take those Ba’athists out of the usual day life... -oh wait.... 90% of this country are Ba’athists. -really? -yeah. -well ... let’s allow them back again.  (from A Conversation with Bremer, transcript reconstruction with the help of connotative evidence).  Riverbend reports;  urlLink There's nothing that can describe the current feeling in the air... There's a sort of truce going on in Falloojeh but the problem is that we still hear of people being killed on both sides and areas being bombed in the city...  She says there is a lot happening at the moment, but she has come down with the "so much is happening how do i blog it my pc despises me" flu. This flu, though not lethal, can have serious deblogatory side effects. Conspiracy theorists have dubbed it blogilogical warfare and suspect the outbreak originated in a poorly quarantined web research laboratory. A recent plea in the shoutbox from another Iraqi blogger appears consistant with the flu's symptoms. All bloggers that feel they may be coming down with a bout of this are advised to rest, drink plenty of liquids, and eat well. Riverbend will pull through, and more blogging will follow.   urlLink  Update  (re Memory Hole images).

      41 Iraq blogs. That is really very few. Fewer still are the Iraq bloggers inside Iraq, from what I can see there are about 15 or 16 blogging regularly from inside Iraq. According to the  urlLink CIA world factbook  the population of Iraq, as estimated at July 2003, was 24,683,313. Even allowing for war you wouldn't think there have been so many casualties that only 15 out of  24,683,313 are left alive to blog (yes I know, there are more things in heaven and earth then blogging, but 41 blogs from the land of the worlds most famous blogger, that is not many).  Why so few? Could it be that now Iraq is liberated there is no need to blog? Perhaps Iraq is far less liberated then some would like to think, blogging still too risky. But presumptions like this do not really help, or make sense when compared with  evidence available from the rest of the world. The US, landmark of liberty, has thousands of bloggers. Iran, with the dubious distinction of having  urlLink arrested  a journalist for blogging, has hundreds of bloggers, in both Farsi and english, many of them women. So why are there so few Iraq bloggers, and why are so many of them young men? Is it internet access? Is it fear? Living in a war zone difficulties? Spare time and cash? Is it lack of information? Do people in Iraq know that it is possible to keep a diary that thousands around the world can read (and probably would if they knew it was from Iraq)? Do people in Iraq know that it is possible to keep a diary in Arabic or Persian, online, to share hopes, dreams and criticisms with each other this way? Are Iraqis modest? Do they not want a thousand leering eyes peering into their hearts?   Why? Why the silence?  Many internet cafes have opened in Baghdad and Basra in the last year. Does business thrive for them? Does it thrive on the business of overseas journalists and soldiers? Do ordinary Iraqis use these places? To Email? To blog? Meet a friend? What would happen, if a  blog -cafe opened in Baghdad? Would people be afraid to use it?  The pentagon is holding writers  urlLink workshops  to encourage troops to record their wartime experiences. How can the people living in occupied locales be encouraged to write about  their  experiences?

      Conflict continues, this time in Basra where UK troops are based,  urlLink 68 are killed  in suicide bombings targeting police stations.    The Pentagon draws up plans to increase troops  "if needed"  urlLink (more funds may be requested)  while Blair has  urlLink no plans to increase troops,  and seems to be having polling problems. Results from a Guardian survey  urlLink show that support for the war has slumped from 53% in January to 41%.  A similar specter looms in the US with young voters becoming  urlLink increasingly politically aware,  and president Bush's "re-election" campaign  urlLink losing financial advantage   (why should a re-election campaign be needed? Did it matter  urlLink the last time? ).  Things are getting a bit tight. What would you do, if you were a president in a similar position? Why, but of course,  urlLink urge a patriot act renewal.  The provisions up for reauthorization include such controversial measures as so-called ''roving wiretaps,'' as well as broad search powers that critics say violate the Fourth Amendment.  But Bush expanded his call Monday, asking Congress to further strengthen the legislation that's raised the ire of civil libertarians and some within his own party by broadening the government's ability to issue subpoenas, to tighten bail provisions and to expand the federal death penalty statute ... ''Some in Congress not only want  to expire, they want it rolled back,'' Bush said in a 45-minute speech that sketched out a vision of a world where America stands as the only bulwark against terrorists who ''have no soul and have no conscience.''     Some in Congress want to expire? How inconsiderate, some people just have no soul and no conscience.

      It is becoming clear that war is not only an undesirable method of "forging ahead" but also a futile one. Up until now, as long as war has been profitable there has always been someone willing to try it, to weigh the overheads against the net gain, the broken lives against the financial ledgers.   Trench and chemical warfare, the first cases of shell shocked survivors, starving civilians and livestock, the burned villages and pillaged fields of WWI were enough for people to declare never again. A scant few decades later, humanity outdid itself in the hellstakes with WWII. Since then, public response to war, although always silently disapproving, has grown increasingly vocal. Vietnam, Algiers, the horror of Cambodia's killing fields, pages and pages could be filled with war and the names of the places it has taken. Each time a war breaches public consciousness we recoil, and in trying to comprehend our atrocities we look for a villain, for a Pol Pot, a Milosevic, a Saddam, someone to lift the blame from our shoulders and unburden us of guilt. How could we let this happen? Again. And again. And again. And the tests. The Christmas Islands, the Mururoa Atolls, the hidden military laboratories, the people, the primates we sometimes substituted.   Each time we hear of a new war our resolve solidifies, our horror fixes, the danger seems a little closer to home, the image a little too real. It becomes clearer and clearer that war can never be conducted tidily. Each has its own hidden cripple that sooner or later crawls towards the light where we can see it. The Falklands, the 1990's Gulf War, Kosovo. Finally Kosovo. Suddenly what seemed to be a simple minimal collateral air run became hundreds of thousands of people streaming towards borders, a humanitarian crisis within weeks. An unexpected tragedy, and just one more reason for the UN's reluctance in endorsing this latest middle eastern misadventure. Has there ever been a successful war? No. The short answer, is no. Has there ever been a war somebody made money out of? Yes. There have been a handful of people who have profited at the expense of everyone and everything else. Is it worth it? No. It is not worth it.   And am I going to march down some street bawling "troops out now"? No. I am not. Let W Bush have his troops. Let him deploy them all over the world. Let him chew up his military budget, and then his domestic budget, and finally his own salary. Let him deploy his troops and never give them a moments rest, until they are tired and weary of their futile expeditions, of the dirt and sweat and grit and noise and stench and uncomfortable clothing and infrequent sleep and lost companions, let them grow tired of the empty jaws their administrations slap together, mashing out words between teeth and tongue till no one can understand anymore. Yes, let W Bush deploy his troops all over the world until tired and sick with war and its false promises his own troops turn on him.  the United States under W Bush has troops in  urlLink 135 countries.   Here is the list:  Afghanistan Albania Algeria Antigua Argentina Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belgium Belize Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Brazil Bulgaria Burma Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Chad Chile China Columbia Congo Costa Rica Cote DÃ‚Â’lvoire Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Djibouti Dominican Republic East Timor Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Fiji 	 Finland France Georgia Germany Ghana Greece Guatemala Guinea Haiti Honduras Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iraq Ireland Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Liberia Lithuania Luxembourg Macedonia Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Mali Malta Mexico Mongolia Morocco Mozambique Nepal Netherlands New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria North Korea Norway Oman Pakistan Paraguay Peru Philippines Poland Portugal Qatar Romania Russia Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia and Montenegro Sierra Leone Singapore Slovenia Spain South Africa South Korea Sri Lanka Suriname Sweden Switzerland Syria Tanzania Thailand Togo Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom Uruguay Venezuela Vietnam Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe  (a lot of prospective purchases for  urlLink ihath , may prosperity shine upon her megalomania.)

      I was looking for something else today and found an old bit of writing dated April 1999. This was at about the time NATO was bombing Belgrade, and refugees were streaming into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, a year before Milosevic was overthrown.    It is not an especially outstanding piece of writing. Here it is word for word;   I am horrified. I think the whole world is in shock. The only ones who speak of it are the newspapers and the t.v. Everyone continues with their daily lives. The unspeakable has happened. A tragedy so enormous is unfolding that no-one can truly grasp it. Not in our day and age. Not in our civilisation. For we are, civilised. It could not happen again ever, and surely not so soon. How could such a barbaric thing occur. How could we not possibly have learnt anything. It is not our fault. It is that madman. And we are safely miles away. Safely? The whole world seems in disarray everyone is fighting someone or for something. And to make matters worse, those who were formerly dissidents on the edge are now eagerly jumping into the fray while the chance for vengeance is high. It will be short and very very bloody. But it has been boiling at least the best part of a decade and who knows what is brewing at the core and who has really been stirring the flames. And in the name of what. I suspect it is not so cleancut a horror story and I imagine someone else has stoked that tyrants pot, and is stoking others too for their own ends to unity. And what price to pay for that.    There was a question I remember asking myself at that time; in the event of increased conflict, how would a media savy population react to increased propaganda promoting war? I mean, most of the world has had television for the best part of half a century now. The Balkans wars were not the first to make televised primetime news. Vietnam, the Falklands, previous Gulf wars, all these have been televised to some extent. But even since the early 1990's Gulf conflicts, the increasing degree of propaganda western populations have been exposed to is phenomenal. No, I don't mean political propaganda, I mean the sort that tells us which dishwashing detergent to buy, or which brand of tea will make us happier, which toothpaste to use and which toilet paper is softer... you know the sort, you see it everyday. Advertising companies have been in a bind for years because of consumer fatigue - we know bull when we see it. So, if we can recognise hype in the form of an advertisement telling us a hamburger and fries are wholesome - then surely we could recognise hype telling us bombs will bring peace to the earth.   I wondered what would happen; a). How would we react to war propaganda, and; b). How would propaganda machines counter the cynical nature of a media saturated public?  Well, five years later I guess I have an answer to those questions.

      What do the Balkans have to do with Iraq and the Middle East? Why do I have a sinking feeling? Why does conflict always seem so unique each time it arises? Why are we so easily persuaded that deadlines are tight and that change can proceed only when accompanied by weapons or mindless slogan repetition?   Time is never short and we have all the hindsight we need, centuries of it. Change can proceed without weapons and without mindless slogan shouting. Change can proceed with careful consideration, and will be stronger and more stable for it. There is usually an approximate ten year period that follows political upheaval. This is the formative period. What forms during this time can be changed also, but is less likely to.

      On Liberation and loss there-off.  Sorry, I haven't posted much about Iraq blogs for a few days. There are, unsurprisingly, no new ones to count. If I were living in a war zone, I would probably be too pre-occupied to start a web site too.  I have been here though, reading Iraq blogs that already exist from people who are busting their backs to shed light on their circumstances for the rest of the world;  urlLink Faiza,   urlLink Raed,   urlLink Khalid,   urlLink Riverbend  and  urlLink Zeyad.  See sidebar links for more.  Most of the boys (young men) seem pretty mobile and move around quite a bit, reporting scenes from all over Baghdad, and also reporting gossip from other young mobile men friends.   Women's freedom of movement seems more restricted, by safety concerns if nothing else, although Faiza does report quite a bit from traveling to work and also hears regular news from her customers. Riverbend does not seem so fortunate. She writes last month of a rare trip out, to Karrada - a shopping area. She writes that this area used to be full of women, but that they are now  urlLink a startling minority.  She describes the subtle  pressures she now feels in visiting the area as one of the few woman in the street not wearing the Hijab.    urlLink Others  (if you click on that link, be prepared for the WWII propaganda posters at the bottom of the page) have written about the changing roles of women during and after war, but this seems to reflect the experience of western women. I am not sure that much has been written about the experiences of middle eastern women during and between wars. I don't have the experience to give such a topic fair coverage and am only making distant observations. If anyone is reading this who has something to add, or thinks I am off mark, would like to disagree, or has valuable personal experience - please, feel free to comment. The comments facilities on this blog are fairly safe. No-one will be edited, discussion, experience sharing and dissent is welcome (although insult slinging and intimidation is not). It would be very interesting to hear from anyone who has anything to say.  War in western countries, WWII especially, has been credited, in an unexpected twist of fate, with increased freedoms for woman. Women who filled the roles of absent conscripted men, providing the labour force for western countries during previous periods of conflict, acquired a taste for working outside of standard domestic roles. When these wars were over, women in western countries sometimes continued to work outside of the home, probably as many of their husbands simply did not return, and those who did were not neccessarily capable of work. Women became workers, mothers and nurses for their own broken men.   In middle eastern countries the opposite seems to be true, there is a sense that liberties are clamped down on, probably because of safety fears, as well as other politic-religio reasons which I do not feel qualified to talk about. Women begin to wear traditional forms of protection - the Hijab and full body covering garments seem almost in this sense to become a form of armour in order to move outside the home. Remember this old post from  urlLink Nawar?

      Blogging - Random   I heard an interesting discussion on  urlLink air  this morning about weblogging. Guests on air included some people I have never heard of before this week; Jay Rosen, Lee Rainie and  urlLink Rebecca Blood .   So, here are my novice thoughts about weblogging, disagree if you like. Blogging is a medium of reciprocal exchange. It does not replace other forms of media. What it does often do is enrich & bring together other forms of media, sometimes intentionally but more often then not I suspect accidentally. The experienced and inexperienced are free to mix and sometimes even do; age, gender, ethnicity, web experience, income and dress sense at times mysteriously dissolving online. Bloggers share ideas, info & technical support. They express, entertain, air dissent and lapse into embarrassing bouts of poetry.  Most bloggers do all this absolutely for free, and increasingly for the sake of freedom itself.   I have heard discussions before about current public scepticism for traditional forms of media. This scepticism is perhaps traditional in itself. In 1945 Osmar White, a journalist traveling through occupied Germany, encounters a similar scepticism in, of all people, a population that is traditionally described as compliant and thought of as media malleable. This from a sheet metal worker he spoke with at the time;  Q; Did you ever listen to British radio? A; Sometimes. Everybody did.  Q; Did you believe what you heard? A; It was propaganda. There was more truth in it then the newspapers. But it was only propaganda.   Q; Then it didn't make much difference one way or the other? A; No. We listened only to find out what was going on.  ....  Q; Then you didn't believe even in German propaganda? A; No it was only propaganda.  Cynicism is perhaps a survival mechanism, and bloggers can be found critiquing themselves as much as they critique other forms of media. That is not to say all bloggers are twisted, distrustful, malcontents - some are disarmingly honest & reveal vulnerabilities that are humbling. Others would probably be ringing talkback radio if they didn't have blogs.   Personally, I believe that some traditional forms of media have become far more conscious, accountable and exploratory then they have been in a long time. I suspect blogging is part of a wider spontaneous consciousness which is also occurring in other traditional forms of media.   Blogs, if nothing else, are artifacts of our time. In the same way that a 2000 year old broken pottery shard tells us about the life of someone 2000 years ago, so does a blog tell us about life today. From the teenager who tells us he is babysitting his younger sister while she pesters him at his keyboard, to media heavyweights, to journalists who write for paper publications and on personal blogs, to people blogging from war zones. Yes, it is risky, yes, it is worth it, and yes, anybody can do it. (Even with a beaten up second hand pc and intermittent internet connection).   Now, enough about my ideas, there are other blogs to read.

      I heard about this a few days ago; a freelance journalist who managed to obtain a videotape used by a resistance group to recruit new members. The story;  urlLink what the DVD reveals is that coalition forces have underestimated the enemy because they didn't even know who they are: ordinary Iraqis frustrated and humiliated by the occupation.   Meanwhile, these reassuring words from the current US president George Bush;  urlLink "Nobody likes to see dead people on their television screens."    The images from Iraq that I have been seeing over the last few weeks are full of young men outdoors waving weapons. If I were to assess the composition of Iraq's population based on the images I have been seeing, I might be forgiven for thinking Iraq is full of young men running high on adrenalin. Where are the women? Why aren't stories about Iraq's female population making cutting edge news? Could it be, Mr President, that in sparing the west from images of dead people on tv, the media is also sparing us from footage of women outdoors in Iraq?  More outdoor pictures;  urlLink Marines in Fallujah.

      Just heard on my local  urlLink radio  that British forces are sounding very fustrated with the way things have been handled. I'll publish a link to the story soon.   Update.   From Sean Rayment, London;  urlLink One senior officer said that America's aggressive methods were causing friction among allied commanders and that there was a growing sense of "unease and frustration" among the British high command. The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said part of the problem was that American troops viewed Iraqis as untermenschen - the Nazi expression for "sub-humans".  and that is just the beginning, the article goes on;   urlLink "The US troops view things in very simplistic terms. It seems hard for them to reconcile subtleties between who supports what and who doesn't in Iraq. It's easier for their soldiers to group all Iraqis as the bad guys. As far as they are concerned Iraq is bandit country and everybody is out to kill them."  and finishes;  urlLink The officer believed that America had now lost the military initiative in Iraq...  TheTelegraph UK  The Age carries the same story;  urlLink The officer explained that, under British military rules of war, British troops would never be given clearance to carry out attacks similar to those being conducted by the US military, in which helicopter gunships have been used on targets in urban areas.   As a result, the Daily Star reports a softer line; urlLink ...US officials agreed to the cease-fire at the behest of their allies in Iraq who roundly criticized the military operation.  (A softer line? Soft seems an incongruous word to be following mayhem with. Exhausted perhaps, or weary, or maybe even doubtful - but soft?).   urlLink Cease-fire  ABC News Online uses plainer language;   urlLink Iraq's interim Governing Council is calling for a nationwide cease-fire, including in Fallujah, hours before a temporary truce between US troops and insurgents is due to expire. In a statement after a session on the deteriorating security situation, the council calls for a "global cease-fire ... The US-installed council is calling for meetings with all political, tribal, religious leaders in Fallujah and Najaf.    And like a mouse on an exercise wheel, watching the rungs go by - doesn't this one look familiar? Another  urlLink "kill or capture" mission  was apparently being prepared last night.

      Iraq, land of rumours...  Secrets in Baghdad;  urlLink people came from falluja (today), with a new story: they said "the mojahideen only destroyed the American vehicles and left, then a foreigner photographer came and offered some people who were standing there 200$ to burn the bodies and let him take the pictures..   Back to Iraq 3.0;  urlLink This just in. Thanks go out to reader Odis, working in Baghdad, who has forwarded me a scanned flyer purportedly from Muqtada al-Sadr calling for an end to the fighting that has killed at least 42 Coalition troops and hundreds of Iraqis this week. The translation is roughly as follows:  ...(sentiments re authenticity with-held).  Wires;  urlLink Tonight I got an email message from the commander of a battalion of US troops, somewhere near Tikrit, asking me to evaluate the Iraqi personality. He cut his message short because he thought that his position was being attacked by mortars. This is the reply that I sent him…  (careful, wires).  Healing Iraq has many observations;  urlLink You can now clearly see what we call 'looting scouts' in every neighbourhood. They are easily recognised because they are strangers, often unkempt and ragged, and they look right and left in excitement, spreading all kinds of eerie rumours...    urlLink ...I don't know about the situation in other areas of Baghdad, some bloggers are reporting that things are 'normal', however I'm afraid that the word 'normal' has lost any meaning it has in Iraq today...    urlLink ...A whole year has passed now and I can't help but feel that we are back at the starting point again. The sense of an impending disaster, the ominous silence, the breakdown of most governmental facilities, the absence of any police or security forces, contradicting news reports, rumours everywhere, and a complete disruption in the flow of everyday life chores...    urlLink ...It is the most foolish and selfish thing to say "pull the troops out", or "replace them with the UN or NATO". Someone has to see us through this mess.  And on that, paradoxically, I have to agree. So long as there are US occupying forces in Iraq, there will be a a media spotlight on Iraq, and regardless of the factual certainty/uncertainty that accompanies this media coverage, at least it means Iraq does not slip off the radar. So, go on, out you go, trawl through what ever media resources you have and keep your eyes pinned on Iraq. If you hear silence, be very suspicious. It is strange but this whole weekend has had me comparing the politics of war to scenes of domestic violence. Do you remember the Tracy Chapman song?   Last night I heard the screaming Loud voices behind the wall Another sleepless night for me Won't do no good to call The police Always come late If they come at all   And when they arrive They say they can't interfere  With domestic affairs Between a man and his wife And as they walk out the door The tears well up in her eyes  Have you ever felt powerless while someone else suffers, and without knowing what else to do, turned a blind eye? Or, have you ever had a blind eye turned on you? No, I don't think soldiers and guns and tanks are ever the answer, and yes, I do wish they didn't even exist, and no, I will never ever ever support war. But I do agree with Zeyad, "Troops out Now" is a lame slogan and can't even begin to address what is going in Iraq and also in the rest of the world right now.  When I realised people were actually reading this blog I made an effort to be non judgemental and keep my own opinions out of this blog. But like it or not, freedom to express opinion has become a salient issue  in this war. If you don't like it, feel free to comment - weblogs may be one of the last bastions of freedom of speech (In Iraq, and increasingly in western areas of the globe).  If I haven't curdled your blood yet, you might be interested in reading on. Reports from both bloggers in Iraq and other media sources seem to collude that things have quietened down.  Some seem to feel that things could still boil over, but I am going to go out on a limb and say with totally unfounded guesswork that things may improve more then you'd expect.  Iraq and Iraqi's concludes with;  urlLink It was a calm day I hope it will continue to calm down and all the hostages to be released.

      This week will be over soon, but those In Iraq who survive it will probably be soothing burnt out tensions for decades. How does peace follow war? With a limp and a hollow vow; "never again". How does peace follow war? With a weary population crawling back to the surface, assessing the damage, and piecing together their lives, again.  My stomach tied in knots  Hands tied behind my back  What difference could I make This far away  Iraq is Iraq, not Vietnam, not Afghanistan, not some lesson in political poker. No historical lottery prize is ever awarded for pinning the tail on revenge. Any number of recent or ancient events could be pulled into the arena, any number of faces implicated, but it is human temper that sustains circumstance. A temper flares, a temper wanes. Anger as brief as regret is timeless.

      Heard on  urlLink radio  a few hours ago; a Sunni~Shiite releif convoy is marching towards Fallujah with food and medical supplies.    Bloomberg.com;  urlLink  Muslim groups called for Iraqis to march peacefully to the predominantly Sunni town and to take supplies there, AFP said.     And on CBC news;  urlLink Fallujah hospital director Taher Al-Issawi said Thursday that more than 280 Iraqis had died in the fighting since Monday... But the casualty count is a shocking one for the Americans as well, with 30 U.S. soldiers being killed since the weekend.

      You either laugh or you cry. Try a smile with this Khalidism;  urlLink the country is revoluting.  Read Khalid's latest, he has a short story to tell about American soldiers who sheltered overnight in a mosque in Sadir city, the Imam (sheikh) of the mosque offered them protection saying (Khalid's translation) "they seeked protection..and our islamic morals prevents us from hurting them..as long as they are inside..they are under my protection."  Riverbend, echoing a sentiment in Healing Iraq's post yesterday, is reminded of events this time last year;  urlLink I woke up to the sound of explosions and gunfire last night and for one terrible moment I thought someone had warped me back a whole year and we would have to relive this last year of our life over and over again…   Faiza posts again;  urlLink I heard that people are arranging a blood donation campaign. They say that hospitals are full with injured and killed people.   Nabil, usually the Iraqi blog sport channel, blogs that  urlLink The situation in Iraq now become more bad and more than bad because the Sheia Muslims are fighting the collusion Forces and the Sunni Muslims are fighting them from another side and We the Iraqi citizens are hurt of what happens.   From Iraq Hack;  urlLink the lieutenant, a two-star officer of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, said, grabbing another firefighter. "He may wear this uniform, but he is Mahdi Army." Then the lieutenant tapped his own chest. "We may work for the government now," Lieutenant Kadar said. "But if anything happens, we all work for Sadr."   Omar, on Iraq The Model, talking about Muqtada, would  urlLink prefer to see the IP capture him rather than the coalition soldiers because this -although maybe difficult- will show that Iraqis will stop who tries to harm our people and destroy our future even if he's a cleric and even if he has many aggressive supporters.    Another mosque story from the Jarrar quarters, this time from Raed; “Yes, we destroyed the mosque at Falluja because terrorists were hiding inside it, and we killed many ENEMIES hiding there”. Read past Raed's staple comic routine and he gets serious with  urlLink The Three Smart Political Steps of the Day:  finishing;  urlLink Killing hundreds of Iraqis and dozens of foreign soldiers (Americans, Brits, Italians, Polish, Ukrainians, El Salvadorians and others) is not the answer.   ... and Iraqi Spirit quotes  urlLink Emily Bronte.    Everybody has opinion/analysis to offer, but there does seem to be a consensus that many people are staying indoors if possible, and are generally keeping their heads down, if not their blogs.

      Faiza sheds more light on recent events, and shares gossip from the shop;  urlLink "an American tank was hit and burned, but an American helicopter took it away so that journalists won’t see it.”    Healing Iraq has another update, including such gems as;  urlLink I was standing outside with neighbours yesterday afternoon gossiping when a car drove by, threw a couple of fliers at us, shouting "read them, may Allah increase your reward".    Back to Iraq also has  urlLink more,  Iraq Hack has  urlLink published  and Iraqi Spirit follows a review of the Falluja incident with these observations;  ~   urlLink Ever since the creation of Iraq, it has been like a pressure cooker that is waiting to blow up.    ~   urlLink At the end of the day there are some underlying problems that have been there since before Saddam has come to power and they simply need to be fixed.   ~   urlLink Iraq and Iraqis need to have a long period of peace and tranquility, to heal them internally as they have never experienced this kind of life for any sustained period of time.   And from where i am? These two quotes extracted from a  urlLink paper  today;  1. An (un-named) senior pentagon official focusing on al-Sadr and his followers; "We are going to focus on dis-banding them, de-arming them and we'll do that deliberately and with a plan". (Aye? As opposed to without a plan? Accidentally?)  2. Abu Musab Zarqawi, quoted as an Al Qaeda operative, in an audio tape aired on an Islamic web site; "We will not let you off, you snakes of evil, until you lift your hands off our mosques and stop shedding the blood of Sunnis".  Well, what a swell party this is.  I can see things are going swimmingly and expect peace shall be restored in no time at all, with the efficiency, tact and diplomacy that we all know and trust so.

      A bit has been going on these last few days. American administrators are due to hand over sovereignty to a new transitional government in Iraq by June, and the pressure seems to have accelerated this week. If you scroll all the way down the bottom of the side bar you'll be able to see the most recent posts from Iraq bloggers on the situation.  Superficially, it seems violence has flared up following the gruesome deaths of four Americans employed by a security company (unclear about details of the company), the arrest of a Sadr aide in connection with the murder of a rival cleric last year and the shutting down of a pro-Sadr newspaper last week. I say superficially because of a sense that there are also other deeper tensions distorting events, and i don't really know enough about them to be any clearer.  Zeyad blogs from almost onsite  urlLink "I wanted to take some pictures but my father and uncle both said they would shoot me on the spot if I tried".  Raed has been posting  urlLink daily since Sunday , while Riverbend blogs on   urlLink Riots/Demonstrations    by Al-Sadr's followers in Baghdad and Najafby, and then resorts to stargazing. What else can one do? Ruin ourselves on earth we might, illuminated by the spectral light of suns already expired. Chris, on Back to Iraq 3.0, has comprehensive coverage  urlLink "Sunday was bad. Very bad." , and Salam talks straight;  urlLink Every body, even the GC is very careful how they formulate their sentences and how they describe Sadir's Militias. They are thugs, thugs thugs. There you have it.     urlLink This  blog has also posted a link about what is going on. Not an Iraq blog, but worth checking the links he posted on Monday and Sunday. David is also, quote, "not wasting bandwidth repeating anyone's party line",  and has a hip template (even if it's not his).   And, from outside Iraq, way over the other side of the world...this morning on the radio I heard part of an interview with the editor of an independent news paper which was pulling out of Iraq. The paper was called Iraq Today, and the editor decided after receiving death threats that it was time to go. Unfortunately it was early, I was sleepy, and that was all I heard. I found  urlLink this  though, and i think  urlLink this  might be the paper.

      Karaoke blog war has been  urlLink declared,  and is  urlLink quietly  underway. Don't say i didn't warn you.  Alright, enough with disclaimers. This song was originally banned in the US, but Sarah Jones revolted, took the case to court, and won. Now the song is free to air, not that you'll be hearing it much, these days. Sarah Jone's lyric's reference her contemporaries indiscriminately, her voice expressively dripping with sarcasm and ruthless with disillusionment over the west's later 20th century sexual revolution.  Probably you may need to exercise the subversive cells in your brain to relate this to blog counting.    urlLink Your Revolution  ~ DJ Vadim feat Sarah Jones 1999  Your revolution will not happen between these thighs Your revolution will not happen between these thighs The real revolution ain't about booty size, The Versaces you buys, Or the Lexus you drives. And though we've lost Biggie Smalls,  Baby your  Notorious revolution will never allow you  to 'lace no lyrical douche  In my bush. Your revolution will not be you killing me softly with fujees Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring and produce little future M.C.'s Because that revolution, will not happen between these thighs. Your revolution will not find me in the back seat of a jeep with L.L.  Hard as hell,  You know "doing it an' doing an' doing it well",  You know "doing it an' doing it an' doing it well" oh no, u no Your revolution will not be you smackin' it up, flippin' it or rubbin' it down Nor will it take you downtown,  For humping around Because that revolution will not happen between  these  thighs. Your revolution will not have me singing "ain't no nigger, like the one I got" Your revolution will not be you sending me for no drip drip V.D. shot Your revolution will not involve me "uh' feeling your nature rise"  Or helping you fantasize Because, that, revolution will, not, happen between these thighs O no, not between these thighs, o no My naked brother, your revolution will not make you feel "a' bombastic"  "And really fantastic" And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic, a' a' You will not be touching your lips  To my triple dip  Of french~vanilla butter~pecan chocolate~deluxe Or having Akinyele dreams, mhm A six foot blow job machine, mhm You wanna subjugate your Queen, aha. Think I'm gonn' put it in my mouth just because you made a few bucks? Please brother, please Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave  And making me believe  I'm some caviar eating ghetto Mafia clown Or me giving up my behind  Just so I can get signed  And maybe have somebody else write my rhymes I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown You know I'm Sarah Jones  Your revolution makes me wonder; where could we go,  If we could drop the empty psuedo-props and the ego We'd revolve back to our roots, use a little common sense,  On a quest to make love, De la soul, no pretense.  But, your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex  And status to express  What you feel  Your revolution  Will not happen between these thighs, Will not happen between these thighs  Will not be you shaking  And me *yawn* faking,  Between these thighs  Because the real revolution That's right, I said the real revolution You know, I'm talking about the revolution  When it comes,  It's gonna  be real It's gonna  be real It's gonna  be real  When it finally comes  It's gonna be real

      Ok, bear with me on this art thing, I just read about the Hewar Gallery in a magazine today; the  urlLink Hewar Gallery courtyard...   ... in conjunction with the Hewar Gallery, this is Artvitae's entrance page to  urlLink  "Live from Baghdad" an online exhibition and sale of artworks by Baghdadi artists.   There are a couple of other interesting links on the opening page to help set the scene. Then ~  urlLink to the show.  There are 51 pieces, you can click on an image to find out who it's artist is, and/or send an e-postcard of the art.    I've been reading a bit about the Iraqi art scene, but you might as well go and see for yourself rather then have me just rehashing what i've read.   It's interesting, there seems to be/have been a quite strong art movement  in Baghdad, drawing significantly from expressionism. I've mentioned I think before, the parallels that could be drawn between German expressionists in the early 20th century and expressionism in Iraq during the Saddam years. Although, of course, there are differences too. An artist learns how to survive, even in the harshest conditions, some perhaps learn how to save their souls from withering by speaking in images. Expressing emotion is often risky and if the risk of arrest is additional then maybe that is an insight into the heart of an artist, express and risk possible execution, or contain and risk suicide. The stories of these artists are as varied as anyone's, and seem to cover a subtle spectrum that at times ignores politics, and at other times can't escape it.   (And in case you wondered, those are 100% un-rehashed original Emigre thoughts).

      Palestine and Israeli weblogs. "What has this to do with Iraq?" you well might mutter. Well, probably only as much as that I felt like freshening up with a bit of diversity and a few links about something(s) a little bit different...  Abracadabra... Be ready, these really are all quite different from each other...   urlLink The Israeli Young Nudist's Society  it might not be good for melanoma, but it sure looks good for world peace... ( warning;  do not click if nudity offends).   urlLink Raffah Kid Rambles  "Diary of an ISM'er. Israel Palestine conflict & slightly Rafah-centric Blog".   urlLink Aron's Israel Peace Weblog  posts an interesting  urlLink piece  about a recent peace gathering in Tel Aviv attended by approx 120,000-200,000 who came together, and then merrily embarked upon an exercise in podium dissent (sounds like weblogging), free speech how sweet the sound...  This from Aron's post...   These people were motivated by two major events of the past two weeks: the so-called referendum, held by Sharon among the registered members of the Likud Party, which had the intolerable result that some fifty thousand people - less than one percent of the Israeli citizen body - decided a major national issue, and that the settlers and extreme right acquired an effective veto even over a partial and half-hearted withdrawal such as the one proposed by Sharon. Hard upon this came the shock of the unexpected blows suffered by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip. The army learned the hard way that invading Palestinian towns and refugee camps inside armoured vehicles does not always render the Israeli forces completely immune. The general public came up with the word "Lebanon", which for Israelis carries the same connotations as "Vietnam" for Americans.    urlLink Kufia  "a collection of images, artworks and words". Open to contributions from collectives and individuals world wide. Some confronting images, but worth spending time and looking at all the pages. Raw, very truthful, youthful, images. These artists aren't holding anything back.   urlLink Not a Fish  by Imshin; "The meaningless chatter of your regular split personality Israeli mother trying to make sense of current insanity".  And Finally  urlLink The Muslim-Jewish Jewish-Muslim PeaceWalk...  "Abdul Rauf and Rabbi Lynn engage in creating peace walks, Muslim-Jewish dialogue and text study groups, youth work and interfaith workshops and services. They recently participated in a Fellowship of Reconciliation Interfaith Peace Builders trip to Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine."

      Sorry this is a rehash post, i almost gave up blogging and became a parasite commenter on Dean's World. I even considered making a squat claim on one of his old threads and turning it into a temporary weblog. Then I wondered if that might be stretching his accommodating nature a little too far. Anyway, here is a rehash of bits of recent conversation;   urlLink Dean  Esmay's  urlLink warwiki  has been created, and is showing promising signs of evolution.  This may prove to be an excellent opportunity for people who have argued both for and against war to finally come together and arrange their ideas without slinging insults at each other.  Even Dean concedes that;  "There are, I believe, anti-war positions that are thoughtful."  Ironically, this could be a small step towards peace, it is just too bad that while some of us are in the fortunate position of being able to discuss such things, there are people right now in Iraq who are not.   Anyway, it's fun to have contributors from different points of view bringing together facts in this way. It seems to put people on their best behavior, being careful about presenting facts, and even considering, if not agreeing with, each another's information. So far it seems to be developing a nicely weighted feel, serious, even perhaps a goodnatured undercurrent.

      There's an old theory about thoughts that just float around in the ether, waiting for people to pick them up and make them real. There's no telling who will pick up these thoughts, or what exactly they will do with them. A whole lot of people might pick up the same idea at the same time without even knowing or meeting each other and do completely different things with it. Some people might render a thought in a fairly benevolent way, and other times, well, some people are just not benevolent at all. Like the time I was serenading an undisclosed reader and got a bit carried away by publishing the lyrics to Sarah Jones  urlLink Your revolution,  and then about a week later Fallujah revolted. Spooky. I stopped singing for weeks afterwards.   Then there was the time I became a bit bored and pretended to be a nice lady soldier offering re-educative services for  urlLink these  stakhanovite heretics, within about 48 hours   those  photographs hit the headlines. Creepy. I stopped impersonating female soldiers for days afterwards.   Coincidences aside, the collective-pool-of-thoughts idea has been around for awhile, and I suppose that it is part of the attraction in weblogging.   Well, this is all a bit of a round-about way of saying that someone is setting up a  urlLink War Wiki,  a pool in which  thoughts about the "war on terrorism" may collect. Yes I know Dean sounds like a biased hound, and he probably is. The point is that in a wiki anyone can change or add or edit anything they like. Dean gives a good description himself;  urlLink "What is a Wiki?"  (Thank-you Dean). So basically, if Dean writes an article about "the Wondrous Beneficial Leaps in Evolution that May be Implemented Through Creating Depleted Uranium Environments, and How Great it Would be to Give Birth to Children with Three Legs to Help Them Walk Faster" then later on someone could go and rewrite the whole thing to help him say what he really meant; "depleted uranium sux". Of course, if someone wrote that, someone else would probably come along and edit out the profanities... so that, eventually, a quite reasonably accurate article studying the effects of depleted uranium might evolve.  Sorry. This is getting a bit long. Here is some  urlLink wiki  background info for anyone like me who wasn't really sure what it was till about a week ago (coincidently just a few days before reading Deans post) another  urlLink What is Wiki?  blurb and Deans original  urlLink War Wiki  post.   This could be fun.

      The comments in some Iraq blogs have been, at times, a bit of a battlefield. There is even a blog, published by a former military psychiatrist, dedicated to driving the wedge even further between Iraq bloggers, hammering in the  pegs between already imagined divisions. "Imagined?" I hear a hallucinatory voice query. Yes, imagined. For what else but imagination builds such impenetrable walls from words.   Dialogue, queer beast, at one moment driving apart the similar and at another bringing together the disparate.  What cannot be shared with it? What peace there might be without it.   Well, fear not gentle bloggers, here it is;  urlLink Iron Blog,  the gameshow blog to take the heat out of your comments (if you are lucky enough to have generated any at all).  urlLink What is Iron Blog?  Whatever it is, perhaps it might help soothe the sting of the afflicted, ease inflammations, present an alternative for the authors of certain email discharges. Why heckle Iraq bloggers? Why self-immolate in haloscan? You could be an Iron Blog challenger! (Or at least, part of the audience).    Update   And  urlLink here  is one of the "Iron Bloggers".

      Firstly, technical apologies; sorry about that activetopic comments box that used to sit in the sidebar, it's disappeared again this week. Seems to be an occasional activetopic dalliance, it usually shows up again, eventually.  Secondly, off topic as it might appear;  An email arrived on Friday, from a woman in Italy with a screaming baby and a job and not much spare time, and she ended her message with this expression, an expression just asking to be blogged;   "in the wolf's mouth and in the whale's bottom" (translation from Italian, meaning good luck).   I think it is may be one of those phrases where you throw up your hands in the air, tossing all three caution, hope and gravity to the wind at the same time.  And then you just smile, because luck ran out years ago, and it's the only thing left to do.

      How might feeble attempts to manipulate public opinion be identified? Perhaps by prime timed execution and lack of impact. The interim Govt has been installed. Saddam has been  urlLink handed over.  Bremer has  urlLink flown  at the bequest of his publicity advisers.     urlLink smh  26/06/2004 key British officials are urging the much-disliked American administrator to pack immediately and make his flight out of Baghdad a big media event, in the hope that Iraqis might believe that occupation has ended. (Paul McGeough)    (pffft, Bremer in the air means the occupation has ended? Well we all who blog know how little physical presence means when it comes to meddling in other countries politics).   Yes, insincerity is all in the  urlLink timing.   As for trying to raise some kind of handclap in palming off Saddam - puleeease besides it avoids the real issue; how are future tyrannies best prevented? Prevention would tend to be the more important issue one might think, tyrant removal being the tricky and seemingly too often ineffective business that it is. One might observe that an expired tyrants structures are too easily claimed by other tyrannical bodies, while the period of anarchy following a tyrants demise primes a populace to accept almost anything in replacement for the sake of order. It would be better to consider ways of avoiding tyranny in the first place. Tyranny is best avoided by considering the circumstances under which tyrants come to power and then addressing these issues. While prevention is preferable, it is worth noting that tyrant removal is perhaps best conducted by those who have suffered the tyrants boot, rather then by some mock after the fact "here we caught the fox, now you can play with it" trial.   Meanwhile  urlLink archbishops  write in protest to Blair, mothers  urlLink mourn  and arms  urlLink flood into Iraq.

Here's a bit from Haj's latest post;   I collaborate a lot here with an older guy who is an independent like me and over here on his own. Let's call him Joe. We have become fast friends and he has turned into one of the few people I trust implicitly here. Loners need to stick together, especially in Iraq. I don't know why I like him. Perhaps its because he's a down to earth working class guy from Bayonne, New Jersey who tells it like it is. Maybe its his Polish ancestry and his weathered bald head...

With insider knowledge, his book details how the case for war in Iraq was constructed and presented (to Australians).   Other interesting facts; Shortly before the book was due for release a copy of the manuscript arrived mysteriously, without the authors permission, in the hands of Captain Martin Toohey - a Navy Reserve lawyer - who forwarded it "in alarm" to the Australian Attorney-General's department. (It is understood Captain Martin feared he may have been set up upon receiving the manuscript. A Vietnam Vet, he no doubt spooked himself and thought he'd better dob in Wilkie's book). As a consequence the Attorney-General secretary, Robert Cornall, called Mr Wilkie's publishers and the book has since been heavily  urlLink censored.   So, who still thinks all the fun happens in the Northern hemisphere? Sleep easy dear readers, secure in the knowledge that intrigue blossoms in the south as it does in the east, west and north.

      Mike Tucker documentary update. You may remember me mentioning Mike's documentary, Gunner Palace, before. The Guardian gave it a write up a few days ago. Mike is in the process of looking for a distributor for the film, so keep an eye out for it. In the meantime, here's a link to the  urlLink Guardian  article;   "One distinctive thing about Gunner Palace is that the soldiers speak freely. I had no minder, nobody screened my footage," Tucker said. "I was allowed to do whatever I wanted for two months."  "A lot of soldiers told me that they resented people at home, a lot of the cheerleading going on. War has become a kind of entertainment. One soldier says, at the end of the film, when you get off your couch with your microwave popcorn, you're going to forget about this, but we'll never forget.  "He's not saying whether he's for it or against it. None of the soldiers really did. I think that's the last thing on their minds."  Most, he says, just wanted to go home.

       urlLink Life In Baghdad   This weblogger seems to have been posting quietly from Baghdad since Jan this year. He has been writing letters to friends with news from Baghdad since at least June 2003, and later began publishing the letters on this blog. As the writer of these letters says;   We have lived very very strange days, that I cannot just let them go by without sharing them with someone.   He has some interesting observations to offer, tinged with black humour. Just to give you a style taste, here are a few more quotes.  On laws introduced outlawing the (blackmarket) selling of fuel in January;   Luckily, like every other law stated in Iraq, laws only hold for about a week or so, then they don't apply anymore!!! This has always been the case with law in Iraq.   On democracy;   There is one subject that I haven't talked about in this message and that's whether to have "elections or selections" as was expressed by one of the station.   On electricity;   To sum up, electricity is better now. Though frankly don't know whether electricity got better, or better had redefined itself.

      Just what everybody has been waiting for! The long awaited campaign to re-activate Iraq's internet country code! With June drawing to a close, by this time next week the Iraqi Interim Government will be installed (yes, I know, its a temporary pastiche measure, yah yah, but one step at a time hey). While some in Iraq bunker down and prepare for a possibly  urlLink contentious  week... the rest of us lurking here on the web have the opportunity to sign this momentous petition;   urlLink  The Worldwide Petition to Activate the Internet Country Code for the Nation of Iraq    Here is a brief explanation for people like me who need to ask "er, what?"  An internet country code is the part of an internet address that goes sort of where the .com or .org bit is. Some examples;  .jp  Japan .de  Germany  .fr  France .jo  Jordon  .af  Afghanistan .sy  Syria  .us  US .uk  UK   So a full Syrian address might look like this; www.somethingoranother.org.sy or a full UK address might look like this; www.whatever.com.uk   There are many other country codes. Iraq's is .iq but it was deactivated shortly before the latest war and is still inoperative. This petition lobbies to have the code reinstated.  You can read more about the petition  urlLink here  and sign it  urlLink here.  You can also copy and email this link; http://www.dialoguechannel.com/iraq_petition.htm to as many people as you know.   The Dialogue Channel (www.DialogueChannel.com) is organizing a worldwide petition to activate the Internet country code for the nation of Iraq.  The all-important ".iq" Internet domain for Iraq is currently unavailable even though it was designated in 1997 and briefly activated years ago. Without the identification of this "top level domain" Iraq cannot join other nations as a peer on the Internet.  All Internet users are urged to sign the petition, including Iraqis who wish to use the .iq country code, and all others who wish to help the Iraqi people participate in the international and Internet economies.  The petition is directed towards the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which controls country designations around the world through its contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Copies of the petition will be shared with all governing authorities in Iraq, as well as cultural and economic institutions, to assure a transparent process in reactivating the .iq domain.    Lets sign it and see what happens...  maa assalaama    Update.  An ibcdweller says;   .com .mil .edu .net and .gov are a little different.  They are used instead of the country codes. In another example of Amerikan cultural imperialism, they are either loosely for American domains (.com and .net) or strictly (.gov .mil. .edu).  Things like .com.uk are subdomains of .uk. Just like xyz.uk or moc.uk or anything. Nothing special about .com in that position.

      As per previous post.  The Kufa district requires repairs to phone service. Source ~  urlLink Abbas.    Kufa is the site of  urlLink recent  fighting.

      Areas of Iraq are without phone lines, meaning without even partially functioning phone lines. This at the best of times would be inconvenient but when a part of the globe at the site of quite extensive conflict does not have lines to the rest of the world, circumstance becomes particularly unsatisfactory.   There are several issues involved. First the loss of infrastructure due to recent damages, whether as a result of coalition force damage or insurgent damage is a mute point, civilian supply is lost due to the action of two warring factions. Second, the complicating factor that the previous regime used communication and other basic infrastructure in a reward/punishment manner. Among other things, areas uncooperative with the former regime had their phone lines "disconnected". The shadow of the former reward/punishment system casts itself upon current circumstance so that it becomes understandable civilians without reliable infrastructure might feel not only inconvenienced but also unconvinced, irked even, by the continuing "punishments" eerily echoing life before liberation.   Of course, there are many other services that falter and fail in times of war, but communications are significant in that;  a). Relatives and friends outside Iraq worry about the fates of relatives  and friends inside Iraq who cannot easily be contacted. b). Information from inside Iraq is controlled by slow release from sites with better infrastructure. In other words people who can phone out of Iraq have phone services that are at least partially operable, suggesting quality of life for them is a probably going to be better and outlook possibly more optimistic then people who do not have access to phones. What we cannot hear we do not know.   Information flow is restricted particularly in areas that are experiencing more extreme difficulties, for example large sections of Kufa which have been without phone service since recent fighting destroyed some facilities.   All of this is admittedly beyond obvious and if you are impatiently pounding your head against the monitor  saying "emigre, for gods sake, say something new" i apologise. Please stop pounding head now, dented cranium is unbecoming.   The long and short of it is that i have started a new link section in the sidebar for areas that i hear of without phone service. The astute among you will probably see difficulties here already relating to point b) .  If you know of any areas your input is more then welcome. If you would like to copy/paste the link/s (atm there is only one that i've heard of, Kufa) into your own blog that is also more then welcome.   This is not a finger pointing exercise, so before you email me a tirade or post thousand word accusatory essays in the comments please understand that i am doing this  in the hope that drawing attention to the situation might help speed up repairs, or at least raise awareness.

      On my kitchen windowsill I have a chamomile plant. A caterpillar arrived a few weeks ago, it's eating the chamomile. I wish the damned thing would hurry up, turn into a butterfly and leave the plant alone. *sigh* if only politics were so easy.  I think it is one of those analogous off topic weeks.  Oh, by the way, did you know Muqtada Al-Sadr has started a  urlLink political party?    This is a fairly recent development, online references suggest the party planning and formation took place somewhere between now and the time of an article posted on  urlLink June 13 . (Note to self; June 13, day  urlLink Election Iraq 2004!  blog results released. Once again the blogosphere anticipates events. Yes we talk an awful lot of trash, but my! how prophetic!)  Muqtada is astutely assuming the new trend in political electioneering set by style moguls Sonia Gandhi and Pachachi, only Muqtada is up chic-ing even their performances. While Sonia and Pachachi actually waited till they were elected before turning down their respective posts, Muqtada is turning down the post before even running for election. Nicholas Blanford, The Daily Star;   Last Sunday, a Sadr aide revealed that plans were under way to establish a political party which would participate in elections in January. Sadr has signaled that he will not seek political office, but will be represented by candidates he nominates.   Well ok, it's a good link, but if you're too busy to click and read i've posted another  urlLink Nicholas Blanford  extract for your convenience;   Earlier in the week, Ghazi al-Yawar, Iraq's interim president, offered Sadr an olive branch, which, if accepted, could turn the 30-year-old junior cleric into a powerful political presence in post-occupation Iraq.  Welcoming Sadr's decision to start a political party, Yawar said "I think this is a very smart move of him."  "I kept saying consistently that if I were in his shoes I would try to go to the political arena instead of raising arms. He has supporters, he has constituents, he should go through the political process and I commend this smart move on his side," Yawar said.  Last Sunday, a Sadr aide revealed that plans were under way to establish a political party which would participate in elections in January. Sadr has signaled that he will not seek political office, but will be represented by candidates he nominates.  "Those surrounding him are pushing him to become a member of a future government. But Sadr thinks he's bigger than a government post," Qubaisi said.  A recent poll conducted by the Iraqi Center for Research and Strategic Studies gave Sadr an average 33.6 approval rating, placing him second only to Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the pre-eminent Shiite cleric in Iraq. The poll found that Sadr was "strongly supported" by 31.8 percent of those asked and "somewhat supported" by 35.4 percent.  By comparison, Ghazi Yawar, the new president, was ranked 10th out of 17 with an average approval rating of 16.5. Ayad Allawi, the new prime minister, was 15th with an approval rating of 11.5 percent.  The announcement came two days after Sadr reversed his initial rejection of the interim government, saying he would recognize it as long as it gave a clear timetable for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iraq.

       urlLink Kurdo's world...    A group of US soldiers were ordered by the CPA to remove the title of Kirkuk University which was written in Kurdish, and replaced the writing with an Arabic one. The reason ?! They said there was "Kurdistan" word on the board.   Kurdo enquires;   OK.. fair enough...But why replace it with an Arabic one ? Why not add both Arabic & Kurdish to it ?!     What? Let Kurdistan become independent, multilingual, free and democratic? Can't have that! Everyone else will want one too!  Apparently the sign was originally in Arabic but at some stage in the spirit of multiethnicism (new word - multi-cultural? neh, this is 2004) had been updated to include three languages; Arabic, Kurdish, and English (um, English? Perhaps that new word could be changed again - multinationalism?). Now the CPA have changed it back to Arabic. With only weeks left before handing over to the Interim Govt, the CPA is making sure the Interim Govt has more things to un-do while they peddle about on the trainer wheels. Will look good for Interim Govt, no? Changing back monolingual CPA signs to multi-lingual, democratic, ethnically-equitable ones.

      World Bank to assist Iraq with  urlLink $38 billion;     Joseph Saba, the bank's point man on Iraq, said the figure was based on recent studies carried out by the bank, adding that despite continuing difficulties he expected the effort to get underway soon.   Very generous.   He predicted that actual work would begin over the next "six to eight months" and be carried out over several phases, with the bulk of the money being used in the initial phase.  He could not say, however, how long he expected the work to continue.  "We cannot set a clear time table for the entire reconstruction plan," he said.  "Nobody can say definitively."   Hmm.   The bank had identified four main priorities or areas it wanted to focus on in the near future, including education, infrastructure and social projects.   $38 bill to Iraq.  urlLink Extended credit  to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.  urlLink $97 million  for social and economic reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  urlLink Who is  this World Bank?    Conceived during World War II at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the World Bank initially helped rebuild Europe after the war. Its first loan of $250 million was to France in 1947 for post-war reconstruction. Reconstruction has remained an important focus of the Bank's work, given the natural disasters, humanitarian emergencies, and post­conflict rehabilitation needs that affect developing and transition economies.    Well, yes, given the worlds current political climate i imagine reconstruction  would  continue to be an important focus of the bank's work. It's to be hoped the bank has enough funds. Although, the bank does seem to have come by some sort of fortuitous windfall lately.

       urlLink Dahr Jamail  travels extensively, speaking with members of the Iraqi Security Forces;   officials with both the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps and the Iraqi Police complain they are understaffed, under-equipped and undermined   You may say, what is new with that? What police department anywhere in the world hasn't complained of staff and funding constraints, or equipment and beaurocratic restrictions?  urlLink Read on  to find out how these problems are exacerbated by several different security forces operating, with perhaps several different agenda's, in occupied territory;      "We’ve lost more than 200 policemen in Baghdad in the last two months, and ten high ranking officers who have been assassinated," Hamid said during an interview in the Coalition conference center.  Hamid said he is frustrated by what he sees as Coalition forces usurping his authority. "We are arresting criminals, and the [US] military are coming and forcing us to release some of them, and this has caused many problems for us"    Apparently, after the Abu Ghraib scandal, many prisoners were released, possibly as  a public relations exercise;   Hamid noted that in a rush to free prisoners from Abu Ghraib and other facilities, the US is setting loose many people the police believe constitute an actual danger to Iraqi society.   On the one hand US security forces are in serious contravention of basic human rights laid out in the geneva convention, with arrests and interrogations uncannily reminiscent of many a collapsed regime, and on the other hand they are "forcing" release of prisoners while Iraq is rife with abductions. Memories of looting condoned by occupying forces earlier during the liberation (no i won't bother using quotation marks, i'm sure you can sense the irony without them) have not done a great deal either in aiding the image that a US presence might desire.   While these things seem a mess, they are explained a little by the blurred effect on job description that the word "security" has. Soldiers are trained to fight, not to enforce law. Local police have been recruited to fight, complicating their already muddied role. Mix all this with severely damaged infrastructure, frustration and a whole lot of tired, tired people; one hardly needs to take a  urlLink poll  to make predictions.

      The flawed findings of a terrorism report presented by senior US administration officials were exposed after academics disputed the reports accuracy. From  urlLink Newsday;     The 2003 figure would have represented a 45 percent drop in terrorist acts since 2001 and brought attacks to their lowest level in 34 years.  But Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and leading academics challenged the findings almost immediately and wrote Powell to ask for an explanation.  Two professors from Stanford and Princeton universities said verifiable information in the annual report actually showed that major terrorist attacks had increased from 124 in 2001 to 169 in 2003, a jump of 36 percent, and that incidents actually had risen each year since 2001.  State Department officials acknowledged for the first time last week that the report underrepresented terrorists attacks in 2003.  "The data in our report is incorrect. If you read the narrative of the report, it makes it clear that the war on terror is a difficult one, and that we're pursuing it with all of the means at our disposal," Powell said.  Powell said the report's data were incomplete and that information had been cut off at certain dates in a manner inconsistent with earlier terrorism reports. "It was a data collection and reporting error".   "It was a data collection and reporting error", hmm, versatile phrase. Trend prediction; "No Comment" superseded.

      A State Department report that showed a decline in worldwide terrorism last year has turned out to be a;    urlLink "big mistake,"  Secretary of State Colin Powell said Sunday. "Very embarrassing. I am not a happy camper over this"   "based on the data we had within the report, there was a suggestion that the number of incidents had dropped and it was the lowest since 1969," he added. "That turns out not to have been correct. We were wrong. We will correct it"   How very convenient;   When the annual report was issued April 29, senior administration officials used it as evidence the war was being won under Bush.    Surely, if the war is being so well won then it might be time to send some of those poor tired troopers home. But no, the soldiers must stay put because now the report is to be corrected to show that the world needs them in action!   "We weren't saying terrorism has gone away. The report clearly says terrorism is a main problem facing the world today. We've got to continue going after terrorists," Powell said.    Apparently the CIA helped to compile the data.    "There's a new terrorist threat information center that compiles this data under the CIA. And we are still trying to determine what went wrong with the data and why we didn't catch it in the State Department," Powell said Sunday.    Perhaps the CIA need to read their newspaper clippings more carefully.   urlLink Abbas  noticed  urlLink first.

Others, voted for in this order; ~ Saddam  ~ To be determined by people of Iraq ~ The people of Irak ~ Emigre (no, i didn't vote for myself, someone else did, thankyou anonymous voter). ~ Constitutional Monarchy ~ Raed  Total Votes over five days; 48 Num visitors over five days; 625 Record number of votes in one day; 23 (Thurs 10.06.2004)  The Hypothetical Webloggers Council lead with 100% of the vote in the initial stages, till I spilled the beans in order to rack up a few more voters. If the silent majority had stayed silent I suspect the Webloggers Council would have won by an even greater margin then they did.  Conclusion; just over half of Iraq Blog Count readers, at least the ones that can be bothered to move a mouse for the sake of el'cheapo poll games, have more faith in a hypothetical party then they do in the existing Interim Govt. Faith in the CPA? pffft, say no more.    The other options are revealing, if at times a little odd.   I think  urlLink Raed  needs to start a political party now, or at least consider standing as an independent.

      In response to Jeffreys comments re Iraq Body Count Methodology. Jeffrey has heard people tell him that Iraq Body Counts methodology is flawed because it counts "ANYONE who dies as a civilian casualty". I have read Iraq Body Counts methodology thoroughly both in the past and again today in writing this post. I find Iraq Body Counts methodology to be sound.  Iraq Body Count does not count "ANYONE who dies as a civilian casualty" Iraq Body Count bases its figures on almost the only available source material it has; Media Reports.  Far from counting "ANYONE who dies as a civilian casualty", Iraq Body Count follows strict research procedures in compiling casualty figures from media reports.  In order for a death to be counted, Iraq Body Count specifies in its methodology that it requires;    that  two  independent agencies publish a report before we are willing to add it to the count.    Iraq body count states this more then once;    Our methodology requires that specific deaths attributed to US-led military actions are carried in  at least two reports  from our approved sources. This includes deaths resulting from the destruction of water treatment plants or any other lethal effects on the civilian population    Iraq Body Count states clearly that it counts only casualties that are  consequences of current military action in Iraq;      ...we record all civilians deaths attributed to our military intervention in Iraq.  The above FAQ does not apply to sanctions; although we are opposed to them, our study deals with the consequences of our current military actions in Iraq.    It has also been newly revised due to our growing awareness that we were too narrowly-focused on bombs and other conventional weapons, neglecting the deadly effects of disrupted food, water, electricity and medical supplies.    The site states that;    Casualty figures are derived from a comprehensive survey of online media reports and eyewitness accounts.  Where these sources report differing figures, the range (a minimum and a maximum) are given.  All results are independently reviewed and error-checked by at least two members of the Iraq Body Count project team in addition to the original compiler before publication.    Clearly, Iraq Body Count counts only casualties that are the result of military action, and even these it compiles conservatively providing  both a maximum and minimum  estimate. Iraq Body Count bases its figures on accounts from  media reports,  not, as Jeffrey seems to be implying, by trawling the obituaries column of Iraqi Newspapers indiscriminately counting every single death it finds. In fact, not one of Iraq Body Counts  urlLink sources  is an Iraqi publication.  As it is clear that Iraq Body Count data is sourced from media reports, it would be logical to conclude that there are casualties which do not make their way into a newspaper column or online publication. Believe it or not Jeffrey, the casualties Iraq Body Count is recording are likely to be only the more spectacular casualties, the ones that make readable news headlines. Mundane deaths, I'm afraid Jeffrey, are probably not going to be that hot for press.  This only serves to affirm that Iraq Body Count does NOT count "ANYONE who dies as a civilian casualty". In fact Iraq Body Count is quite possibly also NOT counting some legitimate war casualties, simply because some legitimate war casualties are going to occur when there is no journalist around to record them, or may be reported in a publication which does not meet Iraq Body Counts specifications to be countable.  Iraq Body Count states that;    For a source to be considered acceptable to this project it must comply with the following standards: (1) site updated at least daily; (2) all stories separately archived on the site, with a unique url (see Note 1 below); (3) source widely cited or referenced by other sources; (4) English Language site; (5) fully public (preferably free) web-access.    Iraq body Count lists its  urlLink sources.  Furthermore, the Iraq Body Count project includes a secure archive of all original sources;    Although it is expected that the majority of sources will remain accessible on the web site from which they were drawn, the project will create a secure archive of all original sources (in both electronic and paper form).  Where judged appropriate by the project team, this data may be released to bona-fide enquirers, for verification purposes.     Iraq Body Count follows conservative research procedures in collecting data from its sources;    As a further conservative measure, when the wording used in both reports refers to "people" instead of civilians, we will include the total figure as a maximum  but enter "0" into the minimum column  unless details are present clearly identifying some or all of the dead as civilian - in this case the number of identifiable civilians will be entered into the minimum column instead of "0".  The word "family" will be interpreted in this context as meaning 3 civilians. [Average Iraqi non-extended family size: 6. -CIA Factbook 2002.]     Iraq body count notes that;    The project relies on the professional rigour of the approved reporting agencies.    Iraq Body Count acknowledges the interest that many parties have in manipulating casualty figures for political ends;    We acknowledge that many parties to this conflict will have an interest in manipulating casualty figures for political ends. There is no such thing (and will probably never be such a thing) as an "wholly accurate" figure, which could accepted as historical truth by all parties.  This is why we will always publish a minimum and a maximum for each reported incident.  Some sources may wish to over-report casualties. Others may wish to under-report them. Our methodology is not biased towards "propaganda" from any particular protagonist in the conflict. We will faithfully reflect the full range of reported deaths in our sources. These sources, which are predominantly Western (including long established press agencies such as Reuters and Associated Press) are unlikely to suppress conservative estimates which can act as a corrective to inflated claims.    The Iraq Body Count team are well aware of the restrictions an independent project collecting casualty data from outside of Iraq faces, and acknowledges that  many projects are needed to evaluate the full human cost of war;     Many projects are needed to evaluate the full human cost of this war. We value them all, but this one is ours. We need to ensure that our study is focused and that its intent, scope and limits are widely and clearly understood. We will certainly build up and maintain our set of links to projects doing related work so that viewers of this site can be pointed to related activity.    Unfortunately, few projects in actuality exist. Iraq Body count is one of those few. Collecting data from hospitals in Iraq would be an obviously valuable source of information, but unfortunately  urlLink Iraqi Health Ministry officials ordered a halt to a count of civilian casualties from the war and told workers not to release figures already compiled.  So you see, we are left with just a few projects run largely by dedicated volunteers, such as the Iraq Body Count team and Raed. Which is admittedly insufficient in terms of the value of existing alongside other projects. Thank goodness at least these few projects have had the tenacity to continue faithfully recording the little that they can.  It is in this context that Iraq Body Count heads their site with the words of General Tommy Franks, of US Central Command; "We don't do body counts".  Iraq Body Counts Rationale clearly sums up the projects aims; to compile a record of civilian casualties caused by war and make accessible, in an index, data from reports which would otherwise be lost; "scattered in different news sources and spread over time";    This project aims to record single-mindedly and on a virtually real-time basis one key and immutable index of the fruits of war: the death toll of innocents. The full extent of this has often gone unnoticed until long after a war has ended, if at all. One reason is that reports of incidents where civilians have been killed are scattered in different news sources and spread over time: one or two killed here, a few dozen there, with only major incidents (such as the attack on the Al-Amariyah bomb shelter where hundreds of women, children and elderly were incinerated alive) being guaranteed headline coverage. But the smaller numbers quickly add up: and however many civilians are killed in the onslaught on Iraq, their death toll should not go unnoticed by those who are paying — in taxes — for their slaughter. It is to these all too easily disregarded victims of violence that Iraq Body Count is dedicated, and we are resolute that they, too, shall have their memorials.    I find the Iraq Body Count project to be of the highest integrity, and challenge Jeffrey to read Iraq Body Counts overview, rationale and  urlLink methodology  in full for himself.  As I replied to Jeffrey previously; nobody has succeeded in debunking Iraq Body Count. Some have tried but not succeeded, primarily because those who have tried to debunk Iraq Body Count are motivated by their own extreme bias and are fueled by their own campaigns and misinformation.

      Perhaps you remember  urlLink Salams  description of a project Raed was involved in last year, surveying civilian casualties.   Well, the information is now  urlLink available here.   While  urlLink Iraq Body Count  counts the death toll based on media reports, the CIVIC project may be the only on ground collection of civilian casualty figures in Iraq during this war.

      Dahr Jamail has  urlLink this dispatch.  You need a cold heart to read it;   He is a well spoken, handsome lawyer, just a year older than I am. He worked as a diplomat who coordinated NGOs and foreign governments in order to bring aid to his country during the sanctions.  He was detained and accused of being a spy for Saddam Hussein, even though he is not even a Baathist.  He was hung from his ankles for hours in Abu Ghraib, until he passed out.  I ask him what else happened to him in there. He pulls up the legs of his trousers to show me two electrical burns on the inside of his knees, and points to two more on his elbows.    urlLink And this  from a California National Guardsman present during interrorgations in a Samarran police station, north of Baghdad;   Sergeant Greg Ford said he repeatedly had to revive prisoners who had passed out and once saw a soldier stand on the back of a handcuffed detainee's neck and pull his arms until they popped out of their sockets.     urlLink ethics.tamucc  discusses a recent NY Times  urlLink editorial ;   According to press reports, military doctors and nurses who examined prisoners at Abu Ghraib treated swollen genitals, prescribed painkillers, stitched wounds, and recorded evidence of the abuses going on around them. Under international law — as well as the standards of common decency — these medical professionals had a duty to tell those in power what they saw.  Instead, too often, they returned the victims of torture to the custody of their victimizers. Rather than putting a stop to torture, they tacitly abetted it, by patching up victims and staying silent.    Why do they remain silent?  urlLink Abbas  offers this;   These people, many of whom -- I am ashamed to say -- are Arab-Americans or U.S. residents of an Arab origin -- decided to remain silent and/or participate in this behavior to keep their dream jobs. I sometimes see Titan advertisements calling for people to joing their team. Another company offers $80,000 + other things as a start salary. No degree or good past employment is required; only passing a test in Arabic and English and, of course, a U.S. government background check.   Returning to Seargent Greg Ford, I add this;   Ford said that when he reported the problems last June to his commanding officers, they pressured him to drop his claims.  ''Immediately, within the same conversation, the command said, 'Nope, you're delusional, you're crazy, it never happened.' They gave me 30 seconds to withdraw my request for an investigation," Ford said. ''I stood my ground."   Still tempted to dismiss these reports squeeking through as isolated incidents? Here is an extract from  urlLink SPR  May 12 2004;   In December 2003, a guard at a notoriously brutal prison used a German shepherd to attack a 20-year-old prisoner lying on the ground and not resisting. The attack, reported on May 9th by the Los Angeles Times, was not carried out at the now-infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq where Americans were photographed torturing Iraqi prisoners; it occurred in Stockton, California at a juvenile correctional facility. Such abuse runs rampant throughout America's prison system, where prisoners are routinely raped, tortured, beaten and humiliated by guards employing brutality to enforce order.  Thus it is not surprising that two of the alleged ringleaders in the Abu Ghraib torture scandal are both former civilian prison guards. Staff Sgt. Ivan Frederick was a guard at Buckingham Correctional Center in Virginia, part of a state prison system where violent abuse of inmates by prison guards is common. Specialist Charles Graner was a guard at Pennsylvania's Greene State Correctional Institute, a notorious death row facility described by an attorney who visited it as "a concentration camp."    I remember something I heard about 26 years ago.  Somebody was describing the shock when footage from concentration camps at the end of WWII was released to the public. Although reports implicating the atrocities had been creeping out to the world for years prior, it was just too difficult to believe that humans could do these things to one another, just to difficult to fathom. Some even dismissed the reports as "enemy" propaganda.  I remember reading about a village whose townspeople were rounded up by allied soldiers and marched through a death camp discovered in the district, in an effort to wake the townspeople from their compliant stupor. But the townspeople just went into shock and couldn't speak about it, some sinking into an even deeper denial.   Some have even intimated that gulag atrocities occurring during WWII were conveniently ignored because Russia at that time was an Allie against Germany along the eastern borders. History to the victor, one might say. Later, many people in other countries became aware of those atrocities, but those things were just too far away to seem real, someone elses nightmare, and when concepts such as liberty and fraternity become entwined with brutality, sometimes people just find it easier to switch off.

      Mike Tucker, who embedded himself with a unit in Iraq (yes, he embedded himself), sent  urlLink this  link which includes trailers to two films he shot in Baghdad.   This type of documentation interests me. It is what i can only call careful, containing a record of the film makers internal experience as much as it contains external information, even to the extent that the film maker is at times clearly uncomfortable maintaining a dispassionate position. Mike describes his presence during these two raids;   The first raids were surprisingly soft. Sometimes we just rolled up and knocked. One night we headed out to capture a general who was on the coalition "blacklist", when we arrived at his house, a team knocked on the door and went inside. He put his kids to sleep, kissed his wife and grabbed a pre-packed bag by the door. He knew they were coming.  On another night, while raiding the home of suspected bomb builders, the scene was very different. One of the suspects reached for a weapon. He was put down with a fist. He and his two brothers were brought out to the lawn. He pleaded to the camera as soldiers commanded him to shut-up, "I'm a journalist. You get this wrong. Do you call this freedom?" I felt confused. I somehow wanted to clear up what I thought could be a case of mistaken identity. Nothing was found in the house. The brothers were taken to Abu Ghraib--four months later they were still there waiting for charges or to be cleared.   During Mikes self-embedded experience he filmed freestyle rapping soldiers and another soldier who played the star spangled banner on an electric guitar on top of the Azimiya Palace (formerly belonging to Uday Hussein, occupied during Mikes stay by a field artillery battalion). On a later visit in February, to the same battalion, Mike found the rapping he had previously filmed had developed into spoken word poetry.  The effect all this has is one of surreality.  Send the soldiers home i say. More poetry, music and air guitar, less of the rest of it.

There are three ministerial positions in this office; - MYA Entertainment & Spirituality;  urlLink Khalid  - MYA Foreign Exchange;  urlLink Omar  - MYA Youth News;  urlLink Majid  (all nominated by emigre).  ~ Minister of Sport;  urlLink Nabil  nominated by emigre.  ~ Minister of Education;   urlLink Abbas  nominated by emigre.  urlLink Ihath  nominated by ihath, seconded by emigre.  ~ Minister of Web Affairs;  urlLink Raed  nominated by emigre.

      I just read Abbas' post on election plans for Iraq. The system will be based on proportional representation, which encourages a system of multiple parties.   As well as political parties, special interest groups will be allowed to present lists, or candidates can run on an individual ticket. To stand for election, a candidate must file a 500-signature petition with the electoral commission.  On any list, every third name must be a woman to ensure that at least 25 percent of seats in the assembly go to women, a stipulation made in Iraq's interim constitution, agreed earlier this year.   Wow, a candidate only needs to provide a 500-signature petition with a 25% female weighting to stand for election! How many visits do the pages of bloggers in Iraq have per  day ? More then 500 for some, and at least 25% of those visitors would be women... granted, many of those visitors are from other countries, still, with a little will-power, it does make politics sound all of a sudden very accessible.   Can you imagine what the streets of Iraq could become in the following months? On every corner a new party with a partition...  More about it on  urlLink Abbas' weblog here.  You will also find some fantastic translations from  Ali al-Wardi's Lamahat Ijtima'iyyah min Tarikh al-'Iraq al-Hadith  (Glimpses of the Modern History of Iraq) there. His page is great brain food, best kept secret on the web, he has a lot of knowledge to share with anyone interested in reading it.

       Shako-Mako Iraqi News  is a marked improvement on it's genre (CMAR's I and II) but i am going to have to take a goodnatured swipe at Jeffrey's promotional material.  Jeffrey's claim;   Shako-Mako Iraqi News is around ten days old now and it is the ONLY blog where BOTH FACTIONS of Iraqi Bloggers have visited, posted, and given encouragement.  So far Faiza, Raed, Khalid, Majid, and the ITM brothers have stopped by and posted.  It is also the only blog that is half-serious and half-humorous about events on the ground in Iraq.   *Sigh* no Jeffrey, yours is not the only blog, nor the first. It's just that it has taken approximately nine months commenting on Healing, ITM and the Mesop for you to realise that it is possible to read Iraq blogs without taking up arms. Maybe one day you will also realise the fallacy behind the "Iraqi bloggers with/without comments" myth. lol. Check out blogroll to right >  But, Jeffrey does get credit for identifying  urlLink impostors.  Well, there you go Jeffrey, you got a link out of me anyway, there must be something in shameless self promotion after all. Asmar would know.  Oh, Tip Jeffrey: many bloggers aren't as innocent, forgiving and moesque linkers as IBC, you would probably have to link them  urlLink first  before they linked to your blog, esp after emails like that.  For anyone who doesn't know, Jeffrey is not that bad a guy, he has a loyal stable of commenters who have followed him from comments on other Iraq weblogs. Good on you Jeff, for helping to alleviate  urlLink Zeyad's  regular commenter burden.   Update;  The Commissar on  urlLink etiquette.

      From  urlLink Avari-Nameh;     Who knew the Red Menace could offer as many choices as a supermarket aisle?    ok, i better put that in context;   I'm a big fan of The Daily Show, Comedy Central's ingenius half-hour satire of world events and political issues... Still, I don't like that the show drips with liberalism, though I've come to expect that, what with all the necessary assumptions of the average Western/secular mindset, trumpeted day in and day out and taught day in and day out.  For example: If you're against the way we're fighting the War on Terrorism, you must therefore be pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage, etc. On the other hand, if you favor helping the environment, spending money not on silly foreign adventures but on healthcare, public works, education, etc., and so on, then you must be a brand of Communist. Marxist, Leninist, Stalinist, Maoist, Socialist. Who knew the Red Menace could offer as many choices as a supermarket aisle?   I guess i'm not the only one tired of all the "lefties" versus "righties" gawd-have-we-not-got-tired-of-this-yet baiting. I wonder at the web, it's almost as if it is full of navelgazers with the propensity for going to war on the basis of bellybutton shape. "Innies United" against the "Outies Front". But then again, perhaps  urlLink Edna  has a better idea of what it is really full off.  Hmm now moderation, that has a certain timeless fashion appeal, like a pair of good shoes, might cost more in the short term, but in the long term keeps your feet dry, is enduringly elegant, and goes with almost any outfit.   Update;    urlLink Avari-Nameh  also has an interesting blogroll, worth clicking around, i'm going back to have another look...

It isn't so much that ethnic politics have been empirically shown to be quite destructive that bothers me. It's the fact that the very notion of ethnicity in Afghanistan is very nebulous and fluid, like all other aspects of politics in the country. I actually have a very extreme view on the subject, as I feel the notion of ethnic identity does not have much meaning within the country itself, and certainly there are no clear borders or lines of demarcation separating groups from one another...     urlLink Afghan Voice  the thoughts of a young Afghan, Arash, blogging regularly since Jan 2003.

That is to say, the surprise party was planned but nobody apparently knew about it except for Bremer)...;   The plan had been that we would have 24 hour notice, and give the press about 8 hours notice before the inauguration. What actually happened was that I came down from the studio at 0900 to find Greg outside Bremer's office wearing a suit. Alarm bells immediately started going off in my mind and my worst fears were realized...  urlLink (read more...)

       urlLink My War  blogged by CBFTW who, it would seem, is a soldier posted in Mosul. Guernica is one of his favorite Picasso's, in fact he even had a poster of it on his barracks room wall back in Fort Lewis. I guess CBFTW had to leave the poster back in Fort Lewis, otherwise he'd probably have to  urlLink conceal it,  that's if he wasn't court marshaled first for blogging William Sherman;   "I am sick and tired of war. It's glory is all moonshine. It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, for vengeance, for desolation. War is hell." -William Tecumseh Sherman   I'm amazed he hasn't lost web access yet. His site has the most comprehensive disclaimer i've ever seen. Seeing is believing, as they say. (Pffft, would you believe it, the moment I typed "lost web access yet" my line actually dropped out. I'll be posting this later).  And one in Arabic;  urlLink Iraq Forever  by Fadhil. Noticed this blog a wee while ago but for some reason haven't linked it yet (perhaps i wondered about authenticity, although that hasn't stopped me from linking before.) Anyway, Zeyad gives his  urlLink opinion here.  Fadhil also blogs  urlLink The Great Iraq  in English, which is a collection of links and articles complementary to Iraq Forever.

      Ever wondered what became of  urlLink g?  Ghaith Abdul Ahad has been hanging out around the  urlLink Iraqi resistance  (one almost gains the impression he enjoys it). I suppose this is what used to be called "grass roots".   ...Then another man shows up, shortish and in his 40s, and while everyone is ducking or hiding behind columns, he strolls about as if he is in the park. Another fighter loads an RPG for him and the guy turns with the thing on his shoulder as if looking for the direction he should shoot in. Someone shouts: "Push him into the street before he fires it at us!" Another fighter grabs him around his waist and pushes him to the corner where he stands, bullets whizzing around him, takes his time, and - boom! - fires his RPG. He stands there until someone grips his pants and pulls him in.    ...The walls and the ground are varnished with fresh blood. In the market a couple of shops are on fire from earlier fighting. A man is hiding behind a pile of empty banana boxes with his eight-year-old son.   Was there ever anything more sublimely ridiculous or heartbreaking then war?

Her's is also the 50th Iraq blog linked here.  Always wondered how long (if ever) it would take for younger bloggers from Iraq to begin forming networks with each other and start developing their own teen audience. (Although some bloggers and commenters revert to the age of 13 the moment they hit a keyboard, which has it's good and bad points i suppose).

      Hi. I am getting crazy here, trying to follow what is happening in Najaf thru my own connections, besides the regular media, and its all driving me Crazy, for the last few hours i have been jumping on the couch every now and then to see if there is any news. there is a say, i cant recall if its an Arab or foreigner, anyway, it says "no news is good news" and this is one of the times that this say was totally damn wrong, the "no-news" is burning my nerves. the only news i saw are about more killed Iraqis, over 90 Iraqi killed in the last 24 hours in Najaf and Baghdad, hundred wounded in deferent governorates, curfew in Karbala during the night for the next three days, blood blood and more blood everywhere. 1400 years ago, the grandson of prophet Mohammed PBUH, Imam Hussein, who is a extremely very important character for in Shea beliefs, he was killed in Iraq, as i said before more than 1400 years, and till now, Shea still cry and grieve in the day he was killed every year (that's on the Islamic calendar, yes we have a calendar, its deferent, we are now the year 1425) because he was killed in an unfair war (it?s a really long story) but he fought till he was killed, he said a line that has become a proverb, he said "haihat minna ilthilla, it means, there is no way we will be dishonored" and he fought till he was killed, as i said. Al-Sadr today is playing Imam Hussein role, he even said the same line yesterday (i think, or the day before, not sure) he realizes, as the Iraqi government realizes, that in case he was killed, Shea will grieve him and make a BIG hero out of him, a resistance figure that will live FOR EVER, Saddam did all he could to prevent Shea from grieving Imam Hussein for 35 years, he used to send the army to Shea neighbors in the grieve day, close the streets, make a security alert all over the Shea governorates, sometimes even prevented them from distributing food (that's what they do, they cook in quantities and distribute food around the city) sometimes jailed everyone who does that, yet, after 35 years, they all were back in the streets doing the same traditions and ceremonies they did since ever, i was saying, that the government realizes that, so they are going to do everything to insure his safety, they will try instead of stripting him in Abu ghreib, or Swiss-cheesing his body, to offer him terms of agreement that they know, and he knows it would kill him politically, by asking him to go on public and tell people to surrender, the thing that i know, they know, Sadr knows that it would NEVER happen, i know, they know, that he prefers to die and become an all-time hero, these terms they made were only made to justify the killing of all the anti-coalition people by saying : we gave them a chance but they refused it. question: why don't American army and Iraqi forces pull out immediately from Najaf? What would they lose? There isn't an excuse of "possible war" here right? Sadrist say that they are defending themselves only, why don't the other forces act wise, and just pull out if the goal is the safety of Iraqi people as they claim? Or is it just the normal kill-everyone-that-doesn't-kneel policy?  just a question!

      Voter registration in  urlLink Afghanistan;    Gawhar, a Kabul University student, said her nephew has been approached several times at high school to sell his voter ID card. She also knows a Kabul woman who travelled to Laghman province and in two days obtained 40 cards by wearing a burqa and opting to provide her thumbprint rather than a photo.   A woman in Kabul is going to vote 40 times? I am kind of speechless, an unusual situation for a weblogger i know. There must be some kind of witty joke to tell. When do voter registrations in Iraq begin?  Cheers  urlLink corey.

      Is it just me? Or are other people missing  urlLink Salam  as well?  Don't get me wrong, I love the other Iraqi bloggers and read them on a regular basis.  urlLink Riverbend  expresses herself with such eloquence and precision that she puts most native English speakers to shame. Zeyad from  urlLink Healing Iraq , keeps dazzling us with his sharp intellect and most substantial posts. The brothers from  urlLink Iraq the Model  keep it real by reporting what is going on in real life on the ground and I love it when they post pictures. And many many more.   Salam wasn't the most eloquent, his pictures where ok and lets just say the substantial part was a bit thin on his blog. But he had tons of characters and he was funny. His blog had what I would call "Shwing". Shwing are the things in life that make you want to say barabeembaraboom. They are hard to put your finger on but you know shwing when you see it. Salam has tons of it.  So, here is my plan to get Salam to blog again. I suggest that we start a blog and call it "Where is Salam?". On this blog we will report the most ridiculous conspiracy theories about where Salam is. For example:  Salam abducted by aliens, proof found. Salam spotted in Nebraska, panhandling on the streets. Pictures of Salam shaking hands with Elvis Presley found in elderly women's attic.  If the theories get too ridiculous, Salam would be forced to resurface just to stop the rumors. What do you think?

      Hi, i invite you to read me at my blog, as i discovered that some of you, dear readers, know me from IBC, not from my blog, and for that i thank the great Emigre:) anyway, my blog is  urlLink secretsinbaghdad.blogspot.com  where you can find more articles, and links to my family members' blogs, mom, raed and majid. as IBC has a comment section, i thought you would be interested in reading this email that i got. take care...                     me*     Hi Khalid,  Many in America share your anger, but the politics in this country is broken. Have you read about Hitler and the rise of Facism ? Well this is American-style facism, there is no other word for it. Things have been building like this for many years. After getting defeated in Vietnam the U.S. facists climbed into a hole and hid for a while, but now they are back and more organized. They are much more organized then the left is willing to admit. It is frightening.  The main thing about American facism is that violence and murder is projected to other countries, like Iraq right now. They can't do it here YET.. but Bush and his gang want to. They despise democracy, freedom... what they worship is money. It's that simple - money.  Americans have protested this war and occupation in hundreds of ways.  But the major media won't cover it, or if they do they label us as "extremists", or call us "anarchists and terrorists". Bush and Kerry ignore the anti-occupation movement..  If a tree falls in a forrest and no one hears it, does it make a sound ?  Peaceful protest is ignored, and so what do people turn to ? Well , it seems many in Iraq have chosen violent resistance - who I am to argue with them ?  I hope you mom feels better, and do what you have to do to protect yourself.

           Hi: it seems that American goverments, are masters in creating enemies, not only around the world, but also inside every country they "liberate", in a year and a half, this american adminstration managed to get ammounts of hate and anger towards America, more than all the past adminstration all together did in the last 50 years inspite of their foolish policy in the ME, still, this admestration, created in a year and a half, more enimies, more anit-American people, that there was ever there. I keep wondering, is there gonna be a day where the American administration, any administration, will try to understand what Iraqi people want? Will there be a day when they wont think that Iraqis are fools, and that they can play all their games without getting caught? I bet that every single one who makes the decisions there in the white house, have never met an Iraqi person in his life, well except Al-chalaby and Allawi probably. when the occupation came in, all these people, the masses, who are called almahdi army now, didn't do anything! And now they are ready to fight not only the Americans, but the whole Iraqi army and police force too, they are ready to die, and to see their city destroyed, just to get red of the occupation, why? when the occupation came in, no one in Falluja, raised his RPG, but after one year, they made the most terrifying trap that the American forces trapped in, and they exhausted the whole American force to the point that the American army agreed on pulling back their forces, under a stupid condition of handling weapons, where the people of Falluja gave eighty something RPG, most of them broken, that number equals what some kids in the streets have. but sure, after killing the largest number of Iraqis they could kill, they followed the same Saddam policy: if he doesn't agree with you, kill him before he makes more problem, then show how sorry you are. and now, as river bend puts it, de ja vu, another falluja in the south, and as she said, after 20 years from now, who will be responsible for the mass graves that will be found? and the same thing is happening in Samarra, Kut, Amara and other cities too, why? one bright thing, that slatering, and mass killing for civilians, created some kind of Sunna Shea unity, the community of Sunni Muslims are collecting money and aid to people of Najaf, as a way to help reduce the suffer of civilians, the same thing happened during the Falluja disaster, Shea in Najaf collected all kinds of aid and sent it to Falluja, unity is one of our greatest weapon against the occupation. we were happy, that water and electricity dramatically improved in the last few days, till we discovered that Allawi government is following Saddam's policy again, step by step, by implementing mass punishment on the Shea areas in Alsadr city and other Shes places in Baghdad, besides Najaf, that's why we had a bigger share of water and electricity. Riverbend is blogging again, check her site. on the personel manner, mom survived an armed hijacking accident, fortunately, thank God, they didn't kill her, they just took her car, purse, mobile phone, some cash, and few other things, mom is ok, she is recovered psychologically from the accident that happened the day before yesterday, she is getting back to her life. at the point she saw these men coming off their cars carrying MP5 automatic machine guns, she thought that they were there to assassinate her (she has been involved in anti-occupation activities through women organizations) and it was a relief to know that they want the car, "only". hamdilla assalama mom! (thank God for your safety) :)) the government pulled all the Iraqi police out of Baghdad, to use them to fight the shea in Najaf, allowing criminals to do whatever they like in Baghdad. as we reached the police station, and when they knew what happened, one of the policemen put something in my hand, that it turned to be a car key, and then he swared two millions times that I will have to take his personel car to use it until we find our car, he insisted to the point that all my refuses didn't work, I thanked him a lot, but I didn't take his car of course, who garanties that this one wont be hijacked too? the good hearts of Iraqi people, is there any other place in the world you can find like them? dad had to leave to Jordan yesterday in a business trip, now I am in charge, I distributed the weapons we have in deferent places of the house, drawing a sinario for deferent plans could be used to attack our house, and plans to fight back, when they took mom's purse, it had her IDs, visit card, and money in $US, which is the worse part, its an indicator that this family may have more, we expect them to attack again, probably try to kidnap one of us, that's the best way to take money from anyone now, God protect us, we trust him, pray for us. in this situation of security mess, if you shoot a thief that was trying to steal your house, if you shoot him in the leg while he is inside your house, his tribe would come and demand to give them money or otherwise they would kill you or destroy your house, or they sometimes chose to revenge only, without asking for money, therefore, its clear for me, that under any kind of attack, SHOOT TO KILL, shot directly in the head, no mercy. Once they have a reason to revenge from you, no one, NO ONE, not the stupid government that cant protect its own members, not the police, not the army, no one can protect you, those are well armed thugs, who control big neighbors, under the situation we live in, even the most peaceful people like myself, can kill in cold blood to protect their families. kill? Its not a horrible word anymore, we have seen thousands and thousands of dead people, people torn into peaces, arms and legs thrown everywhere, blood covering the ground, all side by side with the sound of American machines, tanks and helicopters, every time. what does death mean to you? a clean body wearing the best clothes in a perfumed coffen? zzzzz, wrong, think again, Want to see how is  it really like? Want it to be an easy thing to happen? Just don't join the American club, by not joining, you will sure see a lot of that... BELIEVE ME.                           me*

      The Iraqi Olympic team yesterday draws a wide smile on the faces of all Iraqi fans, after the great performance yesterday against Portugal, letting us forget the sad defeat against china in Asia 2004, and playing with great confidence against strong European team with professional stars like Ronaldo and Boa Morta.  The Iraqi team showed some awesome team work, and managed to scored, Emad Mohammed, Howar Molla, Yonnis Mahmmod and finally Salih Sadeer.  The match ended 4-2 to iraq       The Iraqi fans at Greece didn't stop supporting the players along the match, and they were so maniac :P  One of the fans raised both the Iraqi flag and kurditsan's flag to show unity of new Iraq :)  Best wishes to our team for the next match against Costa Rica P.S: what's wrong with other members here, no one write sport articls here :P

      Hey guyz:)) Yesterday was a very nice day, really, I went out to have lunch with a british friend, who is doing a very nice work on the issue of external dept of Iraq, after lunch we moved to the Faqma, the most famous ice creams shop in Baghdad and we had this great Iraqi-size ice cream, that I bet you cant finish half of it, and its just so delicious! With small peaces of pineapples inside it, liquid chocolate on the top, and a big cookie in the bottom of the glass, that you discover after eating everything inside it, that its eatable too, oh God o love food! Anyway :D As most of you know, I am Palestinian originally, but I live in Baghdad since 1991, I love this city, before this last war (can you name another country where its not enough to say "the war", you have to specify which war you are talking about?! ) we were in Jordan, in our summer vacation, since we have Jordanian nationalities, and we lived in Jordan, and many other countries, before coming to Iraq. As we look Iraqi (ya... the mustache, the dark skin, the tummy, you know) and everything, since my mother is Iraqi, and I talk Iraqi "language" (as I call it) very good to the point that Iraqis who I meet in my daily life, dont know that I am not Iraqi. But still of course, inside our house and among the family, we talk Palestinian, we eat Palestinian food most of the time, we go to Jordan every year (more than 60% of the population are Palestinians, and much more that that in Amman), so back to the subject, we were in Amman right before the war, but we took the decision to come back to Baghdad, just few days before the war, we could let Baghdad go through this alone. As arabs, not Iraqis we had a very difficult life in Saddam's time, we didnt have the right to invest, we didnt have the right to buy a house, we didnt have the right to buy a car, we didnt have the right to have a deposit account in the bank, we didnt have the right to buy a telephone line (you can buy a phone line, but only form another arab, dont ask me why) in a word, everything we have, everything we own, wasnt registered in our names, everything was registered in names of Iraqis, friends and relatives. What I am trying to say, that our interests were severely damaged by Saddam, I hope this answers one of the questions I read above. Have I been in jail? No why have you? But I am surprised actually that I never went to jail, or anyone of my family members, because of our stand of the bath, but thank God, we were never "caught" criticizing anything. Enough about me, I hate talking about myself, so please stop asking questions and making comments about me, this is a place to discuss Iraq, politics, not my personal life, so lets agree on something: I am tiered of the stupid stories about us benefiting from Saddam, can we get over it, and make questions a bit more relevant to the Irqi issue? I read some people talking about the debate between me and ladybird, I decline that, there is no debate here, ladybird made some comments, that I found irrelevant, and tried to answer sometimes, but there is no debate going on here, sorry! As she doesnt live here, I was interested in showing her what is happening here, as I am in the field, and she is not, but after her funny announcement where she said: "Believe me, there is not a single Iraqi, I repeat not a single Iraqi and responsible of what I am saying is Anti-coalition from patriotic feelings. They just lost something with the fall of sad dam, they cant say it in public and they need a mask, so anti-coalition, anti occupation is the name for the mask " after this seinfield-funny annoucement, from ladybird who KNOWS, cause she is HERE and cause she knows each one of the 22 000 000 iraqi, you must believe her guyz! Try to at least, I mean, after all, "she is responsible for what she is saying" :)) I am so out of here! Namrud is one of he most important kings in the old hesoty of Iraq, (old hestory, know what is that jeff?) and its totally impolite to make such comments on the person who used the name, rudness is the weapon of weak, if I wanted to play your game I would refer to that your name, means in arabic a ******************************, while ladybird, as my dectionary says, means *********, but i wouldnt play that game, totally not my style;) So, we are done with this, lets move on with our lives:))) I met a very hi-ranked american officer, a very interesting event, I will talk about it next time, inshalla. Take care Me* ps: aw aw, remember that Sadr-irani thing? out of the 1200 member of Almahdi army who were caught, 4, yes only four were Iranian, best regards for your theory.

      Hey all:))first of all, my apologies to the "nice jeff" :)) i am sorry for the confusion :)this period, i received more mails than i usually get, the majority of my readers were americans (probably 95%, no surveys, but basing on the mails i got)and the majority of my readers, and the very majority of the emails i get, are very nice, very supportive, and i thank everyone of them, and i apologize cause i dont have the time to reply to each one of them, specially for the over-10kb emails, but i certainly read every word and enjoy it, so thank you, and i promise to answer as soon as i can.back to our subject, the very funny thing is that for some people, the reference is Saddam, 35 years of minds-blocking made them think that the reference is Saddam, and thats why i am reading some comments (and with all shame i say i received one of these emails too, from an iraqi) saying: why do yo critisize Allawi, isnt he better than Saddam? or somethign like: whats your problem?? do you want Saddam back?? what would Saddam do to a reporter if he was mad at him??and that is so sad, that is a crack in the manners walls, a crack in the humanity wall, to believe that the reference is Saddam, and compare others to him, to justify their corruption, dictatorship, and arrogance.isnt that just sad? i really want to cry.i wish i was there in that conference, i would stand up on my feet, and ask for permession to talk, and i would say to Allawi in front of the cameras: Mr. president, i demand that you talk to the people in this room in a civilized way, you are an employee, the times of dictatorship are gone, you take your salary from our money, you are responsible in front of us, and we have every right to have all the answers for our questions.am i right or not? wouldnt that be just beautiful? wouldn't it just open a new page of standards that say that the president isnt a God that you should fear, he is an employee that should fear you?i will repeat it again, the president, any president, is an employee, and people are his boss, that is khalidism.as we live in iraq, we see a variety of openions, and its everyone's right, to think what he likes, as long as that doesnt lead to hurting others, that is what democracy is about...right?i want to ask a question!what if, the baathists, re-organized their lines, and came to us with speeches like: finally we got rid of the dictator, Saddam ruined the principles of our party, Sadam killed the good baathists, we will restore the realy baath party, the party that calls for lab lab lab, i think you understood what i mean, and these baathists will run to ellections as a new-old party, now you would say: sure they will fail in the ellections, but i will say: do you know how many millions were hurt by the fall of Saddam, you know, baathists, mokhabarat, whoever, who benifited from the existance of Saddam, those millions, who were marginized after the war, and kept with no jobs (which is a terrible american mistake) they were marginized, the thing that led to the fact that while they are marginized, left out of the community, they were encouraged that way to create their own community, a baathist community, call it whatever you want, and that community is thirsty for power, and want to restore their old lives, dont you think that they will support this new baathy party, and join it repeating the "Saddam changed what baath is about" speech? while i know, you know that they are lying, and that it is only a mean to get to power.what will you do then? ban the baath party? but then we will be no better than Saddam right? ban the parties that we dont like, let them work? you tell me!my point behind all that, is that democracy is a two sided sword, one side provides freedom, good healthy communities, and the other side provides some disturbing people in my comments section:))))                                    me*

       Read what   Khalid said   first and then come back... You must have finished? Great subject? I know. Now, my post.   I recieved this message by e-mail and said "This should be posted somewhere". This somewhere appeared to be this blog.... OK, these are some advices from me to you.      1. Don't use time or words carelessly. Neither can be retrieved.  2. Don't be afraid to learn. Knowledge is weightless, a treasure you can carry easily.  3. Don't run through life so fast that you forget not only where you've been, but also where you are going.  4. Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find. The quickest way to receive love is to give; the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly, and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.  5. Don't be afraid to encounter risk. It is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.  6. Don't be afraid to admit you are less than perfect. It is this fragile thread that binds us together.  7. Don't give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.  8. Don't let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or future. By living our life one day at a time, you live ALL the days of your life.  9. Don't take for granted the closest things to your heart. Cling to them as you would your life, for without them life is meaningless.  10. Don't set your goals by what other people deem important. Only you know what is best for you.  11. Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others. It is because we are different that each of us is special.  I hope you liked them.  Regards Najma

      I REALLY wish that you could see the press conference that Allawi held yesterday, I really wish that you all could speak Arabic, so you can know what a dirty arrogant fascist this man is, besides the Baathist background (yes believe it or not, he was a Baathist) that this man have, besides all the talk that he is the first to import torturing instruments in Saddam's time, beside the talk about him working in an assassination unit for the CIA sometime in the past, (well, people talk you know, but as we say in Arabic, there is no smoke without fire) besides the fact that he came to Iraq in an American tank, beside the fact that he is appointed by the occupation, beside all that, you should have seen the press conference yesterday, to see what kind of people he is. I will give you just a small example: Reporter: Mr. President, these operations that are taking place now, and killing of the Iraqi citizens, the arrest of Aldari (the son of the head of the Sunna Muslims community leader) and the attempt of arresting Alsadr that failed because of the resistance of Almahdi army, all these things, does it happen under approval from your government? Allawi: Iraqi citizens? Which Iraqi citizens? We are the Iraqi government, we are the Iraqi citizens, those you talk about are insurgents, and your question is not an innocent question, you meant it in a bad way, and who is the man you just mentioned? The reporter: Aldari (Allawi pretends he doesnt know the man, who is one of the most important characters in the Suna community, who was in an interview with the LBC, the Lebanese broadcasting corporation, where he explained that the community of Sunna are not going to participate in the so-called National conference that Allawi's government intends to make, and Aldari was arrested just few hours after that.) So the reporter replies:  Aldari, the son of the head of Suna community. Allawi looks embarrassed and says quickly: he was let go (now it seems that Allawi knows the man at least, great), next question.  Iraqi reporter: Mr. President (its common to call the prime minister a president), the mayor of Alnajaf said that there were 400 people killed in the last two days, is that true? Allawi looks at the reporter with anger: where were you since the beginning of the conference? Werent you listening to me? Werent you paying attention? REPEAT WHAT I SAID EARLIER, DID YOU HEAR ME TALKING ABOUT THAT EARLIER?? REPEAT WHAT I SAID EARLIER.  The reporter: you said that the minister of internal affairs doesnt have information about that, and that when he gets the information he would let you know.  Allawi: so you know that?????  The reporter shaking: but Mr. President, the mayor said Allawi: when we have information we will let you know, next question.  And the conference went on and on, he was extremely rude to the reporters, he just reminds you very much of Saddam, HE IS THE IRAQI CITIZENS, AND EVERYONE ELSE ARE THUGS. When I was looking at him , remembered Noori il Saeed, the prime minister appointed in Iraq by the British occupation in Iraq, that what we studied in the history books in the school, and we thought at that time, that occupation is something we read about in history only, that happens in old centuries, and doesnt happen these days be cause of the international law and international community, but here we go, back to my point, I remembered Noori il Saeed, who was acting the same way Allawi is acting, and was called a British agent, like Allawy is called an American agent, you know what happened to him? As soon as the masses caught him, they dragged him in the streets for days, and he was and still, cursed every time he is mentioned, since then, and for ever, I can see that Allawi didnt learn the lesson, probably he thinks that these things used to happen for people like him in the past centuries, and it doesnt happen these days, well, lets wait and see                                                                                                           me*

      Iraq is bleeding, and so is my heart. there are two ways to describe what is happening in Iraq: the first way, is the Allawi-American way: "we are cleaning the country and removing the thugs" which i believe is much easier for many Americans to believe it, because their conscience won't have to worry abouy over 500 Iraqi killed, and thousands injured in the last two days. now, lets hear the other way to describe it: what's happening in Iraq now, is very much the same what happened in Saddam's time: Action: Sunna don't want the occupation: Allawi-Americans reaction: they are thugs, destroy al Fallooja..,"remove them" "lets clean up our country". action: hundreds of thousands of Shea, all Sadr supporters and a lot of other Shea, don't want the occupation. Allawi-American reaction: thugs thugs thugs, kill them all, kill the children so they don't make problems in the future too, kill women so they don't give birth to thugs too. its the same policy, whoever is not with us, he is a criminal, he is a thug, he is a barbarian, he must be killed or sent to hell "as one of the American military police described abo ghreib prison yesterday" its exactly the same as what Saddam did, they all are the same, the new and the old government, they care only about their own interest, and they kill whoever stands in their way. the only important deference is that the Allawi-American government, comes in package of elegant suits, and good English. in the chaos that we live in, no one will know how many Iraqi will be killed by the coalition in these few days, but one thing i know for sure, is that they will kill as many as they can, and as always, the world will watch it on TV, some reporters will make a documentary and sell it to some media network to and make some money, and that's it, and after they finish killing people they will say: we are done with the insurgents, you are "liberated" again, long life justice! each and every one who supported this war is responsible for every drop of blood, every son and mother who was and will be killed, every wife or husband, everyone who supported the war or was involved in it, will be responsible for the blood, and tears, in front of the history, and in front of God. but why do you care? They are thugs and insurgents only, isn't that what you are trying to say? unless one of the elegant suits in the white house, or in the smelly shelters of the green zone, understands that they cant control this country with violence, that they cant follow Saddam steps, that they should litsen to what Iraqis want, not kill them, unless that happens, this country will NEVER rise up again. But God is there watching, and he is greatest, he is the most merciful, and he knows the truth, and you'll see!, actions are measured by the results, as they say, lets wait and see, what are the results of this occupation, and this government, you'll watch it fall, and you will remember my words, but till then, we will keep loosing hundreds and hundreds of souls, and everyone who supported or was involved in this war, is responsible for them, in front of the history, and for ever, in front of God.                                           me*

      The Iraqi stuation becomes very bad last few days, the number of the terrorist is increasing and evreyday the news show us a new gang and a new forgine hostge, WHAT IS WONG WITH US?. The Iraqis showed the world very bad things like stealing the government bulldings and burn them and other things, do they want to stay away from the world? do they want to stay un ecducated? do they do they? a lot of things. In Iraq the number of un educated is very surprising and those poeple who dont know anything and dont feel anything towards Iraq they are destroyding Iraq they will make Iraq a place of horor and violent. I am wondering of how can we slove this problem. of course we cant educate this big number of people even if we tried I am sure that a lot of them will never come to study how to live and not to be selfish and not to stay out of order. the Sadr's gang are fighting from a side the Sunna are fighting from a side, why are they fighting. why dont they just see what the new government can do to them? do they like this way of living no elctricity because they stole all the cables and they are attacking evrey forgine man who comes to fix the stations. no oil for the cars because they are stealing the cars which brings oil to cities. What do they want to do? just fight until make the worlds country stop helping us and they will fight each other then. what will happen if those forgine troops goes out of Iraq and leave Iraq to those terrorist, I think Iraq will become a place which people die evreyday in. I have a lot of feeling but I cant say it in words because those people are really making our lifes bad. They said Al Sestani has a big effect in the Iraqi shiee Muslims then why did he leave Iraq and in this situation in Najaf. dont you think because this man thought that nothing will change those people so he said I'm out of here, and he left Iraq now. And about this fat man Muqtada al Sadr ( SMS) what dose he think himslef is doing ( he is non Iraqi) I believe in that he is just an agent who work for Iran.. I think nothing will change Iraq until the Iraqi people change their minds.

          urlLink Streamtime.org  transmits a web~radio stream from Baghdad on Sundays from 12.00 CET, they also transmit on Wednesdays. You can download the streams  (on Sunday at 12.00)  from their site  urlLink here  and enter the Streamtime Jingle Contest  urlLink here.   Streamtime say their website is not a blog, but the site is laid out in blog-like format with regular posts giving program details, transmission times, and links to the streams. So i guess this raises the next question; if broadcasters can blog, then can bloggers broadcast? Probably time to see if those el cheapo old speakers still work.

      Mind me guys posting this topic here. I just want to get out something from my chest which has puzzled me for quite a while. What is the aim of blogging ?  For me, it is to increase the interactions between the locals, and the outside world. I guess in the west some people (not all) see Iraqis as masked men with RPG s , and suicide bombers, and Sader Militias, etc etc (all the negative images which are shown on TV) ...  For instance, I have never seen the city of Sulaimania on any international television. Fallujah is the most famous Iraqi city after Baghdad. FUNNY !  In the 1990s during the Kurdish civil war, I met some Turkish people in Kurdistan, they said we thought that in Kurdistan they eat people alive. Because what they used to see on their televisions about Kurdistan was men in baggy trousers and a little beard, with a bushy hair, and an AK47, brandishing their guns in the air. They thought all Kurds were like that. FUNNY again !  What we have to do as bloggers, is to show the positive signs of ourselves. We are not terrorist masked men, we don't like guns, we don't like beheading, we don't like killing, we don't like suicide bombings, we don't like torturing prisoners,  and some of us prefer our local Beebsi than Coca Cola (but not all)  !  I know that the foreign journalists are doing their best to cover all the aspects of our lives. But we also have to do it ourselves. This is our life in the first place, if we don't improve it ourselves, don't expect anyone to improve it for you.

      I like it when there is consensus in the iraqi blogosphere. This time everybody is agreeing that it is very very hot in Iraq. AYS from Iraq at a glance is threatening to  urlLink melt  away. Riverbend tells us that she can't blog because she is preoccupied with  urlLink observing  the shape, color and movement of the heat. Ladybird posts pictures of  urlLink Iraqis taking their clothes off.   urlLink Iraq the model  people tell us that the heat makes them curse at themselves but they are still optimistic.  Ok, ok, ok, we got it. It is very very hot in Iraq.  Here is my advice for overheating body situation. Take a sheet or a sarong and dip it in water. I suppose an abaya would do as well. Let the water drip, don't squeeze it out. Wrap yourself with the wet cloth from head to toe. After a while you will feel that you are walking around with your own private air conditioner. Keep it on all day long. You won't look pretty but you will feel cool.

      Hi:me, as a religious Muslim, i am very terrified, and ashamed more than i can describe, and really really sad, because of what happened to the churches in Iraq, it is the most terrible thing that can happen, the criminals who are attacking the houses of God, as we call them, should be given the maximum punishment, that is not enough at all, but i cant find the words or ideas to deal with this, i wish i can apologize to every Christian, i wish i can protect every church, but sadly i say that i can't, i cant protect the mosques or the churches, and i don't know what to do about it :*(the criminals, whoever they are, tried to establish a war between Sunna and She'a by putting bobed cars in holy places, and by assassinating important personalities from both sides hoping that each side would blame the other, but thank God this didn't happen, and both sides were smart enough to understand that game and not put themselves in that position, now the dirty game goes on, but to make a war between Muslims and Christians, i know i cant stop it, i know you cant stop it, but i trust God, he is the only one who can.i am very sorry for each and every drop of blood, i am very sorry for each and every soul, if its in my hand, i would bring to justice anyone who was involved in this for any reason, even if he was my own brother.

      Hi, this is my first post here, so I'd like to say hello to every one.  A new Iraqi blog,  urlLink "The flower of Mosul" , written by a 15-year-old girl from Mosul-Iraq. The same place where I'm living :) She recently started blogging.  She's posted a picture of Duhok in her first post, so we can expect some more pictures, I think.

       urlLink No Pain No Gain ; another new blog, published by an Iraqi New Zealander. Sara, posting under web-name  Baghdad,  left Iraq during a previous Gulf War which she calls " the " Gulf War with the heart warming human tendency we have in claiming wars according to personal impact. I guess she means the one in the early 90's, because when in living memory has there not been a war involving the Gulf? Oop, there i go doing it too,  my  living memory is probably not really that long. Anyway, encouraged to take up blogging by friends (and  urlLink Zeyad )  Baghdad  contributes yet another perspective from her uniquely pacific location.  (Afterall ~ the blogosphere does not revolve around the Northern hemisphere ;)  She came all the way from Seleucia Had a blind date with destiny And the sound of  Te Awamutu Had a truly sacred ring...
