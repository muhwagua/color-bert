       The Sacred Romance   By Brent Curtis & John Eldredge    Johanna gave me this book to read. I want to get it done before i leave so i have been reading when i can. This is a part of the book in which really made me think    "The life of the heart is a place of great mistery. Yet we have many expressions to help us express this flame of the human soul. We describe a person without compassion as "heartless" and we urge him or her to "have a heart". Our despest hurts we call "heartaches" Page 3     "In the end, it doesn't matter how well we have performed or what we have accomplished -a life without heart is not worth living." Page 3   That just made me think a little about my heart and my life. God Bless and have a great day!

       Working at a day care today   Pam called me on yesterday and ask me if i would help her with her daycare. She need to go to Ottawa this morning and i said yes. So she came and picked me up at 9:00pm. I had to sleep at her house last night which was fine by me. I had the best night sleep in a long time even when the baby woke me up around 5 this morning. I guess it is because it was so quiet. I live down on king street so no matter what time it is there is always noise. So i guess that is what has been keeping me up and why i am not sleeping well. Anyways other then that things went well and i didn't realize until today that i miss being around the little kids. So it was a real nice change. I still like working with the youth more. Anyways have a good day i know i will.

      Things are weird and boring for the last few days. I haven't been sleeping well i guess its because of everything that is going on. I started packing last night. I got two boxs full of stuff so far. I didn't realize i have so much stuff. My parents have more of my stuff at their house. Its funny how much crap you can pick up over the years. Tom is having a big fireworks next weekend. Last year they had fireworks going for 45 minutes. I am so happy i am not going to miss it. Its funny how life works and how things are going in my life. I have met the most amazing people here in Brockville even if i don't like Brockville that much. I can't wait until i move back to Fredericton. Brenda is there and she is happy i am moving back too. I miss her she is such a great friend. Amanda is also happy and i will be able to see her more often because she is going to be only and hour and a half drive from Fredericton. Anyways hope everyone has a great day.

      I had the most wonderful weekend! Jo, Katie and I went to Charles cottage. Katie and I were out on the water all after-noon. Charles was trying to fix this fishing pole and he caught a big fish and after that Katie wanted to catch one also. She worked hard and did catch one before we left. It was kind of funny and we had a get time. Jo, Katie, Robert, Charles and I went on a boat for a while too. It was great. Jo and Katie got a sun burn but i didn't. Anyways have a good day!

       I think I am going CRAZY!!!   Well as you can see i am having a bad week. Things have not been going my way! i am job hunting and thats not going well. People here are such ass and now i know why i left here in the first place. Just because i am not 100% french i am being treated different then the others.   I have to get to Fredericton as soon as possible. I have been thinking about going to Fredericton and going on welfare but i really don't want to do that. I need a job so bad. Maybe once i get a job i wouldn't feel so out of control with everything. Its my control issue coming out again. I have talked to Brenda in Fredericton and we have talked about getting an apartment together and also with her daughter. Linda who is Brenda's friend is also looking a roommate.   I was suppose to live with my aunt but she lives to far away from town and the university. It would take and hour and a half just on the bus plus and hour or so to walk to the last bus stop. Just to much for me!   Anyways i have to go because mom is going to pick me up in a few minutes so i have to be ready when she gets here. Have a good day and God Bless you!

       I am moving again in two months and i have been in NB for month now!   Well things have been ok. Still not working and the boss at the place i was going to work said that she will call me next week. What is up that? I am getting pissed with all th crap i am getting here. Some places say they need people but then they don't call me. Man i hate Edmundston people. I have to get back to the big city before i go crazy.  I am moving again to Fredericton New Brunswick in two months. I am moving in with Brandi and Brenda which will be great. I can't wait to move. I think my parents don't want me to move again. Mom's said  "Well this time she will not be so far away!"  I will be about 3 hours from Edmundston. My mom tells me she understands why i don't like Edmundston. Its so small and there is nothing here which pisses me off. I need to be in Fredericton where its nice and big.   Brenda was telling me about the amazing Firework show they had for Canada day. I wish i was there to see it. Fredericton is bigger then Brockville and so they had more fireworks then Brockville would have. Sometimes i wished i stayed in Brockville but i wouldn't have more money then i do now.   A funny thing happened yesterday. I was playing with my mom's dog and he bit my nose. It still hurts today. The little bugger. Anyways i have to get going. Still have stuff to do before i go. Have a good week!

       Lessons to learn!   Sometimes you try to help people who you really care for. What happenes when they don't what to help themselves? What are you to do? Well i know someone who tryed to help out these street kids out. She gave them a place to live for a month. She did this so they could pick money and find a place to live. Well last night the teens decided to bring over a friend at 2AM. My friend got a little upset and in the morning told them that they had to leave. So in other words she kicked them out. I totally understand her and her decision. People try to help other people and these other people don't even give a shit. They got a free ride and i guess that is what they wanted. That is all for now. Have a good day! Peace out!

Three days ago it was so hot everyone just wanted to die and now it feels like winter. I don't know what is going on but its too weird for me. Its like one minute it was hot and the next minute we are freezing. Anyways have to go. Hope you have a warm day!

       Finally Student Loans are in!   I am so happy that my loan has finally come in. I was getting pissed about it. I needed to pay for school and give my parents the money I loaned from them. But all is good. I had an amazing weekend. I got to spend time with my brother and my parents. I had the most amazing talks with them.   I feel that everyone is part of the family again. I think I need to talk because we didn't do it enough while my mom was sick. I started opening the communication up with them. I feel that we are a family again. I did learn things about my brother and it kind of shocked me but that's ok. I also learned that my brother is going through some of the things I did went through as a teen. I really made great contact with my brother. To get going. I need to read some chapters in my death and dying book. Oh that didn't sound right. LOL. Anyways have a good day and night.

We had went out to the bars and went dancing. Anways i have to get to bed soon. So have a good day!

       One Hell of a Day   Well a lot of shit is going on. Lets just say things are very interesting. If you want to know more email me. But it depends who you are. There is some people i will tell a lot more to then others. I think everyone close to me would get a really kick out of it. It is just so crazy why do i get in this shit. Why me? Now that i think about it. It is just too funny.   Humans can be so confusing and stupid at the same time. I have to say i was that kind of human for the last 2 days. But the good thing is that i am learning so much about myself. Which i think is a good thing. Some thing that i really was not thinking about in a long time.   I know for sure that Brandi and i will be friends for life. Because of all the shit that has happened in the last two days and we haven't yelled at each other is a great sign. Love you Brandi, your like the sister to me. Well that is all for now. Have a good day. Hopefully better then mine.

       Trust??    Do you trust everybody you know? That is the question. I know there is a few people in my life that i don't trust. There is a few people who have lied to me. So i have lost that trust in them. Don't get me wrong i don't dislike any them but i would never tell them anything about me or my personal life. What do you think trust is suppose to be? Tell me what you think.

       So Tired!   I need sleep! I haven't been sleeping well at all lately. I think its because there has been to much stress. Today i was up at 5:30am and i couldn't get back to sleep. I felt like sleeping through class. So i went to bed at 12 last night and i had a total of 5 and half hours. Once Brandi is done class we will go home. I need to take a nice long two hour nap this afternoon. Well i am going to go and do some homework. Have a nice day!

       Feeling better   Well i had a crappy week. Things didn't go the way they should have but things will get better. Emotions are runny high here at our place. Everyone needs to take it easy. I just need to relax. I dropped out of one of my classes today. So school will not be so stressful. I talked to my mom yesterday and we did a lot of talking. I got a lot of my feeling out. Which felt so good. My brother has a girlfriend now. Which is kind of weird. I always though of him as a little kid. But his growing up. Well thats all for today. Have a good day!

       Why me ?   Why do things happen the way that they do? Why do these things happen to me? I don't want to feel this way. I need to put things behind me, that i know. But how? Do i have to do what i want. I guess i should face that fear. I should have faced my fears and that i kind of regret not doing so. But i do know that i did the right thing. Which is the right for me now. I got an email tonight from someone i know. He told me that it was normal for me to feel the way i do. I have to met him after classes tomorrow. I am looking forward to that. He can help me with the questions that have been in my mind. I am getting there.   I am about 70% of fully being myself again. I also have fears of losing myself again. But those fears are slowly going away. I have so much support from my roommates. Brenda, Brandi and Linda have been a big help. Without them i don't know what would have happened. Since i have been here things have been good. But yesterday things were falling apart. I want to just scream and cry. Maybe thats what i need to do. Just maybe I have to get things out. But if i do, will I feel weak  or maybe i would feel stronger. who knows!

       Some questions that need answers   I went to see swat at the movies last night. It was really good. Brandi met Jason yesterday and he took us to the movies. Which was really nice of him. After that we played pool. I had a great time. We also met Jeff, Jason's roommate. We had fun and did a lot of talk...well i did a lot of talking. I just couldn't shut up. What is my problem??? please friends be honest with me. Am i some bitch that can't shut up? I have been questioning myself since last week. I need to change things in my life. Since i have been in Fredericton things have been so much better. I am having the most amazing conversation with Robin. Thanks Robin you always know how to make me feel so much better. Your an amazing friend. Love and miss you!! Well thats all for today.....have a good day!

       September 11th   Wow September 11th. Everyone knows about it. I heard some people say they are sick of hearing about it. I understand why people don't want to here about it. I like to talk about because i like to know more info about it. I knew someone who's parents lived in DC not far from where the plane had crashed. I was in my computer class when i found out. Bailey and I went out to lunch and listened to the radio. Then we left class and went to my house to watch it on TV. The famous question was where were you when you found out?

       grrrr...student loans!   I will talk about what is going on with student loans. I have fax them the letter that they needed. This time i didn't forget my SIN number. I wrote them a nice letter and printed up. I am hoping they will have my loan done by next week.    I have been mad about student loans and its not as bad as Brenda. Brenda found out yesterday that she had to reapply because OSAP made a mistake. The university its helping her get it faster. She is hoping to have it around the same time as me. Anyways i am going to get going. Have a good day!

So i sent them a letter to explan things but of course i forgot to put my SIN number on it. So now i have to fax some the letter again to them. So that made my day even more crazy.   My death and dying course is pretty cool. I know i will enjoy it and it is an easy course. Anyways i have to get some homework done. Have a goodnight!

       What a Day! and it still not over....   Well just got out of Parties and Elections class. Brandi is in class so i am waitting for her to get out of class. I have an hour and a half to kill. So i decided to write on my blog since i didn't write anything since Sept 4th. On Friday September 5th i went to my french class which was level 2. As everyone who is close to me knows i speak french very well. I took a lower level course because i have to practice my french writting. Maybe i should take a English course for my english writting too..lol.   Anyways the teacher told me that i needed to go into a higher level course. So she told me to leave. Can you beileve that i was kicked out of class because i was too good for the course. So i told my mom on the phone the other night that i was kicked out of the class. She said " WHAT ?" So i laughed and told her why. I think she though i got into trouble.   Today will be the first day in which i will be going to my Death and Dying course. Some people have told me that it was a good course. I will just have to wait and see. So now i am just wanting for Brandi to finish class so we can go to the death and dying course. Oh Brandi and i are taking the course together.  Classes today went well. I realized that i need to read up on Canadian political science again. I forgot a lot of it since 1999. There was a lot of stuff Heather said that i remember but there is a lot that i forgot.   Student loans are  STILL  not in. I am a little pissed with them about it. I still don't have any money for books. Books are going to cost about $600 dollars.  $600!!!!   Can you believe that! it just plain nuts. This girl that i met today said her friend is paying $129 per book and she has 7 to buy. You do the math. So i realized that i was crazy to come back to university. Oh well it better be good and i get a great paying job after all this crap.   Well i never seen any of my old friends but thats because they have finished and graduated last year. It would have been great to see them again. Oh well sometimes you can't keep in touch with everyone. I met a few nice people so far. Also i met some people that are not on the same level as me. I feel that i am getting old even if i am only 23. There is just so many youths. Most of them are not even the age to drink or buy smokes. So i try to stay away from those groups. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with them. But i don't want to be at a party with a bunch of people who under age. Thats just not right.  Maybe its because i have worked with youth from 15 to 18. They were my friends but again they are not on the same level as me. Do you understand what i am trying to say?  Well i am going to get going. I am just saying stuff so i wouldn't be so bored. Anyways have a good day! Miss you all!

       Went to the eye doctor today!   Well i went to the eye doctor today and it cost $60. She told me that my vision in my eyes went down but not by much. So that was good news. The bad news is that it costs $189 for 6 months.  I will not go back to this place after i buy these lens. I am going to go back to the doctor i had at home. I would pay about $220 for a year there. So i will not be returning to this doctor here in Fredericton. Anyways i have to get going to class. Have a good day!

       Fire Alarm at St-Thomas University   Again things have to happen when Brandi and I hanging out waiting for class or walking down the street. I think we are just having bad luck for the past month or so. Anyways we were sitting outside at the smoking corner. Yes we have a smoking corner because the university people said that too much smoke was getting into the buildings. Whatever! Anyways on with the story. As I said we were at the smoking corner when the fire alarm went off at the  urlLink Harrington Hall.   Then we seen people come out of that dorm dressed in their PJ's on. About 5 minutes later these two firemen came up to us and asked us where Harrington Hall is. What was that about??? STU is like the smallest university in Canada I think. STU has 4 offices and classroom buildings. Four residence buildings and one is off campus and a fitness center. That's 8 buildings on campus and one off campus. Plus the alarm was going off.   How could they not know which building??? I didn't mine telling them but its kind of stupid when all the people came out of that building and standing right there outside in front of Harrington hall. Anyways it was a weird morning. I am going to my parents house for the long weekend. So have a great weekend! I know I will. Happy thanksgiving!

       Brandi and I almost DIED yesterday   Well Brandi and I went downtown. If you know Fredericton we were on Regent St going towards downtown area. We were almost at the corner of George and Regent. Then we see this shitty ass red car go through the RED light and of course there is a big ass truck coming the other way on the green light. Well the both hit then of course the red car is coming towards Brandi and I. Well the car hit the pole that was about 5 feet away from us. Thank god we were not 30 seconds faster because we would have been right in front of that telephone pole.   Brandi and I where both in shock for most of the night. We couldn't believe that we where so lucky to be alive. Thankfully no one was serious hurt. Anyways have a good night.

       No ones here!   I came to St-Thomas this morning and no one was around. Well since yesterday was the last day of classes, i guess everyone was sleeping this morning. You ask why i am here? I have to do an oral exam for french. Yes me who is half french and half english. It stupid to come into town in the morning for 5 mins.  I know that i will do well. I speak french like a speak english. So i shouldn't have any problems. No one is even on MSN. I think its too early in the morning to be here. There is a total of 6 people in the computer room. Its funny because yesterday i had to wait in line just to check my email. People wait last minute to do there essays. What is that about? why do we as students wait at the last minute to do everything? I had a 15 page paper at the begining of this week. You know what? i started it the day before. I think i need to get my ass in gear and get my papers done before. Ya right like thats going to happened. I always said it but never do it. Just like i said i want to quit smoke. Anyways i am going to go. Have a good day!

       Well I think I failed!   Well I had a psychology lab today and I think I failed. But all is ok we have a optional lab at the end if the year to replace one we did really bad on. I think I will have to study a lot harder the next time. I have a mid-term in psych and a French test on Monday. Wow I have a lot of studying this weekend to do.   My uncle is away for the next 9 days, he went to Toronto. So I have the house to myself which is nice. But it's going to be weird that he will not be there.  I didn't sleep well last night. I had a weird dream. My grand-mother who passed away was in the dream and she was very much alive in this dream. We where in this house that I have never seen before. But it was weird because it felt like home. I think my grand-mother is trying to tell me something but I don't know what. It's all too weird. Anyways I have to get to class. Have a nice day!

       What a day!   The day has been long and boring plus I am so tired. I didn't sleep well at all last night. You know when you are tired and want to sleep but you can't. Well that's what happened and I was up like every hour or so. It just is not fair.   Also what is not fair is that I got a crap load of homework to do. I never get much homework and today the professors decided to give a lot. I hardly get any homework in French and he assigned three things to do for Friday. Anyways i am going to go home. Have a good day.

       Well i think i failed!   Yup i think i failed my psychology mid-term! Why did i take psych anyways? Well i needed another course to be a full time student so i thought i could do this psych course. Well lets say that i did so much better in psych in college. I really think the teacher is not so great. Oh well i will get it one day. I also have a french test this after noon and i think i will do well on it. All i ask is to pass.    Better news   The weather is hot hot hot. Its like +2 outside and it so nice to be out there. We also have no classes on Friday because it Chancellor's day. What in the heck is Chancellor's day? If anyone knows please tell me. Anyways i have to get going. I have a french test to do. Wish me luck! Have a nice day! Take Care!

       Nothing much to say!   Everything is going well. I did two mid-terms and I passed on both of them. I also did a Psyc Lab today and I did well on that also.   I think I will be going home for Easter this year. Then I will be back for my last two exams on the 16th of April. On the 17th I will be going home for the summer. Can't wait for that....I am tired of studying all the time.   Amanda will be coming to Fredericton next weekend. I can't wait to see her. I haven't seen her since Christmas. We will be going out to some bar here in town. I haven't went out in a long time. Anyways that's all for now. Have a good weekend!

       What a crazy and funny day!   I was at the mall with a friend today and she picked up some black dye for her hair. She wanted me to dye it for her. So i did and it turned out pretty good.  So after that we took the bus but then i realized we took the wrong bus. It was pretty funny. Anyways the bus took us to down town and not to the university. So my friend decided to get a lip piecing that she always wanted. Then we came back to the school. So that what happened today other then school. Have to go because i have to get home.

       Can you believe it!   My mom forgot my birthday yesterday. I had to tell her. I wasn't even mad about it. It was funny. This is the first time it has happened in my life. I guess everything needs to happen once in life.   It has been snowing all day today. But it's not staying on the ground. I hope this is our last snow storm of the winter. School is ok. I have been doing better in Psychology but i have been doing worst in French. Hopefully i can bring up my mark on the next test. Other then that there is nothing new. So i will go for now. Have a good weekend!

I have a secret for you. I have never told anyonw this. But i have a fear of getting old. Be cause if i am getting old then so is everyone i love and care for. I do not feel 24.

       Movies I have seen in the last few weeks!    urlLink  Sherk 1     (Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz)  I really liked this movie because it was so well done. All the actors voices were amazing. I rate this movie a A-.    urlLink  The Core    (Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Delroy Lindo, Bruce Greenwood and Stanley Tucci)  This movie was good but it didn't seem real. It is not possible for people to go to the core the earth and survive. It was still an interesting movie to watch. I give this one a C.    urlLink  The Hunted     (Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro)  Great movie with a lot of action. It also has a great fighting scene at towards the end of the movie. The movie does seem to have a lot of blood in it. I give this one a B-.    urlLink  The Master of Disguise     (Dana Carvey, Jennifer Esposito and James Brolin)  This movie really sucked! I was hoping it would have been good. Dana Carvey did I much better job in Wayne's World. Anyways I am giving this one a D.    urlLink  Bowling for Columbine     (Michael Moore, Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston)  This is the best documentary that i have ever seen. Michael Moore is on a mission to find out why in the US is there so many murders. Michael says that over  11 000  people died in the US each year because of guns and murder. He wants to know why? His answer to this is because the media makes people so scared of other people. In this movie Michael comes to Canada to see how things work here. He found out that only about  200  people died each year in Canada because of guns and murder. He has seen that people here in Canada have no fear of people killing each other. There is about 10 million people in Canada and 7 million people own guns. It amazes him that Canada has such a low murder rate when 7 million people own guns. I think everyone should watch this movie. If you can handle the emotional parts of the movie you should rent it sometime. I even had tears in my eyes. This movie is shocking and sad at parts but it makes you see the reality of life in the US. I rate this movie an A+++.    urlLink  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King     (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Lan McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and John Rhys-Davies)  Well it is Lord of the Rings and other other movies were exellent so this one was also excellent. I rated this one a A++.    urlLink  Bringing Down The House      (Queen Latifah, Steve Martin and Eugene Levy)  This was an ok movie. I give this one a B+.    urlLink  Cheaper by the Dozen     (Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo and Tom Welling)  It was a great movie and it was very funny. It will makes you laugh! I rated this one a A-.  Well that's all for now. If you want to leave a comment about any of these movies and what you though about them just click on Comments!

        I still can't believe it!    I don't talk much about politics and what is going on around the world because some people find it boring. It's interesting to me but not always to others. I have to talk about this. It affected me a lot because I just don't understand how people can be so evil. I heard this from someone at work. I haven't been listening to the news much because I have been so busy at work.    urlLink Check this out and you will know what I mean!

       Work! Work!   Working that's all I have been doing for the last little while. Its all good that's means more money for me. I have the day off tomorrow but i am maybe going to be called in always. They are going to need someone in the kicthen for sure tomorrow night.   My dad is suppose to get the truck fix so I will be able to drive myself to work. My dad needs the other car. Even if I took him to work everyday and took the car it wouldn't work out because he finishes work before I do. So we need another car here for the summer anyways. Dad said that if its not too expensive he will keep the truck on the road even when I am gone to university. It would be nice bacause I still would be able to drive when i am here on the winter and spring break. Anyways I am going to go because i have the feeling that they are going to call me for work. Have a good night!

       Madawaska-Restigouche   Madawaska is the riding for my home town city. Get this! Jean-Claude D'Amours is the only who is running. Duh! i wonder who's going to win. LOL that's too funny. I was wondering this week why i had only seen Liberal signs up. I guess i answered my question. I guess i don't have to vote since there is only one candidate. It's just a waste of time!

       Federal Elections! Election Day!    I know i don't talk about Political stuff on my website because it can be boring for some people but since no one has been reading my webpage much I am going to cover the Federal elections.    First thing i agree and disagree about!     WHITBY, ONTARIO - Conservative Leader Stephen Harper said Tuesday he would get rid of the national gun registry and divert the money to strengthen law enforcement across the country.   Speaking in a small Ontario town, the Conservative leader said it was time to get tough on crime and time to register sexual predators.   This was taking from the CBC Website. I agree with strengthening of Law enforcement but get rid of national  gun registry.  Is it just me of is this guy nuts. Why in would he want to do that??? I think we have the best gun register system around.    Second thing!    Martin, who was in Vancouver unveiling his policy on seniors and people with disabilities, was questioned by reporters about a recent poll showing Liberals leading by just four points over the Conservatives.   Martin defended his party's governing record over the past decade, but also admitted to mistakes. The Liberal government has been hammered over the sponsorship scandal and overspending on the gun registry.   Ok that's nice since his getting old he wants something good in place when he retires.  Overspending  on gun registry! We need this gun registry. I don't want our country to end up like the States.    Third!    Marijuana Party gets campaign rolling with seed money!   LOL just too funny!!!  Thats about it for now.    urlLink  CBC Canada Votes!

       Tornado in New Brunswick     Well we had a tornado in my area. It was kind of weird. I was at work at the time and I didn't know what happened. My dad picked me up from work and told me we had another tornado. We didn't have an damage around our place. My aunt Claire got it bad at her place. Her house is now on the ground. They were in the house when the tornado hit the house and it landed face first on the ground. No one was serious hurt. They were more in shock then anything. The house fell on the truck. At the time that this had happened. My Aunt was in the hall on the way to the living room. She fell into my cousin's bed room. My uncle had just finished supper and was in the kitchen. He fell against the oven and the table and fridge door fell on him. My cousin Serge and his girlfriend was in the living room at the time. My cousin Serge had a cut on his nose. Everyone else just had sore muscles. I will scan the pic that was in the newspaper and have it on my photo page by Friday. I will not be in color but in black and white. I will try to get one in color. Anyways I have to get some sleep right now. Have a good day.
