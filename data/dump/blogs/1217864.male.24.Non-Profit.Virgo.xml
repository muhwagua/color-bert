      I almost cried when I saw the following online quiz.  As  Bill Walton  might say, "It is the greatest online quiz of all time."  

 Which "The State" Character Are You?   
Appropriately, I'm 
    
So I like bagels, I'm cheap and I'm not made of deli meat.  What's a guy to do?
  

While you're on  Froggy Jamboree , don't forget to check out  the Christmas Cards  sent by each member of The State.  Man, I'm so jealous.  Do you think they'd be willing to send me Chanukah cards?

      I've started off my week with a new deodorant.  I've been using Right Guard Xtreme Sport Power Stripe for quite some time now.  I'm usually against products that use the word "extreme" as a marketing gimic, and even more passionately against those that leave off that first "E" in the word.  But how can you resist that power stripe?  It's an extra dose of odor protection.  

Unfortunately, the terrible and tiny  Giant  grocery store by me in Alexandria did not have ANY Xtreme Sport Power Stripe deodorant when I was there last night.  ( Wegmans  when are you coming to Virginia?)  But regular Right Guard Anti-perspirant was $1 off.  So I figured, "Why not."  

But now I'm going through the "new deodorant switch" where you try and figure out how best to use thew new stuff.  See, with the Xtreme Sport Power Stripe deodorant, four swipes on my underarm would get me through the day without making me smell too much like "sport" or "active fresh" or whatever smell I had last chosen.  But it seems that four swipes might be too many for regular Right Guard deodorant because as I sit here at my desk, with every breathe I take I can smell just how "fresh" I really am.  And I bet that as I walk down the hall I leave behind a trail of "Alpine Fresh" for my co-workers to enjoy.  

I don't want to actually smell like my deodorant, I just don't want to smell bad when I sweat.  Man, I really lead a difficult life.

      Operation Iraqi Freedom has begun.  I was a bit worried for everyone's safety because you just don't know what is going to happen.  Well, fears be gone -  Optimus Prime is going to war .  I don't think we have too much to worry about now.  

Transform and roll out!

      Hey, how'ya doin'?  Good, good to hear it.  Oh, me?  Yeah, I'm good.  Work's been busy lately, but I'm getting by.  I haven't been able to get outside as much as I'd like though.  Yeah, the weather, I know.  It's been beautiful.  Well, except for that rain this morning.  Yeah, I hate it too.  Especially during rush hour.  You get stuck in that traffic this morning?  Oh, it was terrible - like a parking lot.  Yeah, stop and go the whole way.  Took me about an hour to get in.  No, I didn't hear about Liz.  2 hours?!  That's terrible.  This city has to do something about this.  It's a mess.  

Oh, well hey, I gotta drop these off to Bill and then I need to grab some coffee.  I didn't get my morning cup and I don't know if you're like me but I'm a zombie before I get my coffee.  I know what you mean.  Alright, I'll talk to you later.

      I've discovered that I am lazy.  I think I realized this long ago, but my outdated webpage might have been evidence for the rest of the world (yes, that's right, the entire world) to realize this as well.  So what do I do to over come my laziness?  I find ways to make things easier.  And that is why you now see a  blogger.com  button in the bottom of the left column. 
 
Though there are a few kinks that need to be worked out (such as the archives), making updates to this page  should  be much easier now.  In turn, that  should  mean I will post more often.  But like I said above, I am lazy.  The fight continues.  Stay tuned. 
 
You also may have noticed a slight change in colors ( see , only a minor change).  That was a combination of the switch to blogger and my laziness.  I kind of like it this way for now, but if you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to  bring them on .  The customer relations department will take a look at the feedback and present me with a summary report. 
 
Hopefully more posts are to come, maybe even tonight, but for now I am off to  La Piazza in Alexandria  to pick up a surprise chicken parmesan sub for my girlfriend.

      A new day has dawned once again in the world of fast food: 
 The  Cheesy Gordita Crunch  from  Taco Bell  is back.   Yes, that's right - the meat from a tube, inside a taco that is wrapped inside another taco has returned.  What you haven't tried the Cheesy Gordita Crunch?  Let me see if I can explain this fast food work of art.  

It's the regular taco bell taco meat (top of the line stuff) inside a regular, hard shell taco.  Toppings include the regular lettuce and cheese, but go on to include sour cream.  "What's so special about that?  It's like a a taco supreme but without the tomatoes.  Come on, we're leavin' this place."  I'm not done junior, sit your ass down!  

The next step is really key to the whole process so please pay special attention - it is what makes this taco more special than any taco that has come before it.  In fact, let me recap for you: hard shell taco with lettuce, meat, cheese and sour cream as toppings.  Got it?  Good.  From there, the taco artists at Taco Bell wrap flat bread around the hard taco and use melted cheese as the glue to hold the two together.  

Pure genius.  Really, a raising of the bar in what we have come to expect from fast food restaurants.  This taco truly is a taste sensation like no other.  

The Cheesy Gordita Crunch from Taco Bell has walked back into my life after leaving me so abruptly so many years ago.  This event has cast the first ray of warm light and hope on to a world that until today seemed so bleak.

      Jim Boeheim, basketball coach of the  Syracuse Orangemen , was a guest on the  Late Show with David Letterman  last night.  I sat in front of the TV watching it, giddy like a little school girl.  I laughed at his jokes, I smiled proudly when he talked about the National Championship and I even clapped and giggled when they showed  Carmelo Anthony  and  Gerry McNamara  offstage in the Late Show green room.  

And it seems that Boeheim and some of the Orangemen players are going on a whirlwind tour of New York State.  From ringing the  NYSE Opening Bell  to the Letterman gig and even to the  Governor's Mansion for lunch .  

And by Boeheim's side through all of this is his wife Juli.  Oh,  Juli Boeheim .  As  Tony Kornheiser  might say, she still gets it done.  So beautiful and somehow married to  this , a man 20 years her senior.  I'm told he's a very charming fellow.  

But I'm getting off topic.  Clearly, I am here right now to praise the Syracuse Orangemen.   Juli Boeheim, I love you!    Orangemen fans have been waiting so long for this moment   So beautiful   and this team has made so many people happy.   Juli, I could make you happy    It's only appropriate that they get their recognition.   please Juli, run away with me    But make sure you enjoy this moment because an opportunity like this may never come again.    Marry me!    

In summary, I love Juli Boeheim.  Oh...umh...and the Syracuse Orangemen basketball team.

      Clearly Kristen was wrong about her  poor use of toilet paper .  For whatever reason, she still feels the need to defend herself.  In the interest of being the ever so kind and fair boyfriend that I am, her side of the story is below.  

 Kristen Tells Her Story  
It's true. I did put the empty toilet paper roll back on the designated spot without checking if we had another roll. However, while I was in the wrong to the common observer, I feel you were grossly unjustified in blaming me without hearing my side of the story.  
  
The main factor in my defense is that I used the last of the toilet paper around 2'o'clock in the morning. While some people may be chipper and coherent at 2am (after happily dreaming for 3 hours) I am not. I was proud of myself for finding my way back into the bed. I'm not sure if I really opened my eyes fully enough to see that the paper was gone, let alone venture to the closet to see if there were more rolls.  
  
Secondly, I do not use an excessive amount of toilet paper. This means that at some point during the previous day you probably noticed that the roll was becoming ominously thin. As a preventative measure you could have checked the closet and put out  a new roll. Especially since you had already noticed that we were low (proven in your amusing anecdote about checking the sales).  
  
I realize that some people may argue that my second argument is flawed, as I could have done the same. However, I am a very right-brained person and have little patience or aptitude for such trivial details as maintaining bathroom order. I prefer to imagine the forms your pile of pajamas in the corner of the bathroom could take on, or find the patterns all of your little hairs [on the floor] make.  
  
So, while I acknowledge that I could have prevented your trip to Giant this morning, I don't feel I am entirely to blame. And as far as the ice cream-  it was excellent and appreciated. I found it this morning before work, and had a few spoonfuls for breakfast.

      I knew our supply of toilet paper was getting a bit low.  I even went to the supermarket the other day to see what TP was on sale.  Nothing was so I passed thinking we still had one or two more rolls back in the apartment.  Turns out I was wrong.  

Kristen put the last roll of TP in to action without telling me or restocking it herself.  I found this out when that same roll was empty this morning leaving us with no TP in the entire house.  How can you pull out the last roll of toilet paper without making plans to get a new supply as soon as possible?  

Unfortunately, I had a need for toilet paper this morning so I ran out to the local grocery store and got a small supply (so we won't be overstocked if something goes on sale in a few days).  And despite Kristen clearly being in the wrong on this, I got her the peanut butter ice cream she was craving last night ( Edy's  is on sale).  However, I didn't tell her and hid it in the back of the freezer.  She'll eventually find out that we have some, only it won't be until I take it out to scoop some for myself.  

I'm still working on being evil, or even just slightly mean, but clearly I've got a long way to go.

      Probably about once a day I scan through my access logs to see how people are coming to voteprime ( Bel Biv Devoe  is still a very popular search).  Yesterday I noticed that someone had come from  Sugarloaf/USA's  home page.  Just in case you don't remember, for most of the  summer of 2001  I lived in Carrabassett Valley, Maine on Sugarloaf Mountain driving BMW's.  

I haven't been back since that summer.  Do the mountain people miss me so much that they sent out a request to find me on the Sugarloaf webpage?  Or did somebody hack in to the Sugarloaf webpage and fill it with  Dancing Mega Man  and links to voteprime.com?  Well, no, but something is still a little fishy.  The visitor came to voteprime from the Sugarloaf Message Board  Members List .  A member who goes by the name of " I used to live in condo 6 " listed voteprime.com as their own personal website.  So there was no calling of my name nor any hacking and mega dancing.  But there is someone out there pretending to be me.  And I never even lived in Condo 6!  

I sent this imposter a friendly Personal Message through the message board and I'm hoping I'll get a response soon.  But I'd like to know who is out there telling people they are me, living off of my popularity, thinking they'll never get caught.  Well I've got some news for you, buddy: The gig is up - you've been found.  So you better start a'runnin' because it's closing time and I ain't so pretty when the lights come on!

      The Syracuse Orangemen are the 2003 NCAA Basketball National Champions.  Unranked to start the season and ending it as the top team in the country.  The color  orange  is back in style.  Wear it proudly.  

Carmelo Anthony has to be one of the best college freshman ever.  Without a doubt.  And only the second freshman in NCAA history to lead his team to a national title.  But with that said, my favorite moment has to be seeing Hakim Warrick come out of no where to block the possible game tieing three point shot.  Wide open, lined up, plenty of time and suddenly here comes Warrick flying through the air getting his entire hand on the ball and swatting it out of bounds.  I'm tearing up a bit right now just thinking about it, although that might have more to do with the Raid we just sprayed in our office than the sentimental value.  

Anyway, so we can all enjoy this moment together, here it is, captured in photo.  
   

Syracuse: National Champions.  I'll be reminding myself, and everyone else, about this for a long time to come.

      I've been somewhat unbloggie lately.  this time, it's not because I'm lazy.  No, now that I've got the blog rolling again (still having problems with the archives - that's mostly due to laziness) I feel like every post has to be golden.  Sure, I know none of the new posts to date have really been any good, but I put a lot of thought into them at the very least.  

But with this, "Everything has to be perfect" policy, a lot of important things go unmentioned.  So I thought I would recap what has happened over the last week or so and then give you my current favorite link.  
  Recap of Adam's Last Week or So 
 My girlfriend thinks I'm gay, but I'm not.  I'm just a sensitive guy who enjoys watching  "Trading Spaces"  and  "American Idol" 
 Kristen and I have been together for 2 years.  Two wonderful years that have left me loving her very much.  Although I'd be even more crazy about her if she'd get off my back about this "being gay" thing.
 The "America" that is watching "American Idol" came very close to eliminating one of the most talented people on the show.  How could  Trenyce  be in the bottom 2?  The people responsible for this are probably the same people who think "God Bless the USA" is a great song.  Sometimes I hate the world we live in.
 Kit Kat's  Big Kat  is one of the best new candy bars in many years.  Very underrated because I think it is too often thought of as just a big Kit Kat.  Don't fall into this trap.  Unlike a regular Kit Kat, the Big Kat has a perfect "chocolate to wafer crisp" ratio making it chocolately and refreshing.  Put aside any preconceived thoughts and give one try.  Pleaes, I urge you.
 The  Syracuse Orangemen  have made a run to the championship game of the NCAA Tournament.  Absolutely amazing.  This has put a huge smile on my face all weekend whenever I think about it.  The big game is tonight and for goodluck I've got on my boxers with oranges on them as well as an old blue and orange tie (I've also got on pants, a shirt and shoes, but they aren't Syracuse related).  So  watch the game  and root for the 'Cuse as they face Kansas University tonight.
 

And this leads right in to my current favorite link.  Syracuse beat Texas to get into the championship game.  As he often does, during the game Syracuse forward  Hakim Warrick  had a huge dunk that got the crowd fired up.  Unfortunately for Texas, the photo could be seen as a little embarassing, at least that's the way  this Syracuse fan interpreted it .  "How you say, 'Tea Bag?'"

      Without a doubt, the worst song of all time is Lee Greenwood's  "God Bless the USA" .  I don't hate this song with such a passion because it's patriotic.  In fact, I feel there are many beautiful patriotic songs.  No, I hate this song because it has some of the worst lyrics ever written in the history of music.  

But I've learned that there are people out there who like this song.  Then there are people out there who love this song.  And further still, there are people out there who are moved to tears when they hear this song.  Why?  What is wrong with these people?  

And things only get worse.  

A few weeks ago the  American Idol  clan sang "God Bless the USA"  twice  in one episode.  A group of military folk were in the audience and at least on Idol contestant broke into tears.  I was sitting on my couch wincing.  Apparently the rest of America thought it was beautiful because the group has now recorded a  "God Bless the USA" single  where 50 cents of each sale goes towards  The American Red Cross .  And just to make sure everyone's happy, they've thrown in their own version of Burt Bacharach's "What the World Needs Now Is Love."  How beautiful.  

I have my own song.  "What the World Needs Now is Someone to Go Back in Time and Bust Some Lee Greenwood Kneecaps to Make Sure That Song is Never Written."  Catchy title, at the very least.

       A Cry for Help  
Many of you know that I am training for a marathon.  Specifically, I will be in Kona, Hawaii on June 22, 2003 running in the  Kona Marathon .  I am doing this through a program called  Train to End Stroke , run by the  American Stroke  Association  (a division of the  American Heart Association ).  

For those that are interested, Train to End Stroke is a really great program.  Since I started 5 months ago I have gone from run-walking 3 miles to running a full 17 miles.  During the 5 months I've met some great people in my training group, received a lot of great advice from my coach and through the training sessions, and I've raised a lot of money for stroke research and education programs.  

But that right there is my problem: Even though I've raised about $2,000, I'm still dangerously short of my fundraising goal of $4,850.  I could really use some help from those of you who read this (that's YOU!). 
 
But why?  Why would you want to support Train to End Stroke?  First off, although I will be traveling to Hawaii to run this marathon, only 30% of the funds raised go towards paying for the trip.  The rest of the money raised is going towards great stroke  research  and  education  programs to help fight the third leading cause of death in the United States.
  Did you know: 
 Every 45 seconds someone suffers a stroke
 Every 3.1 minutes someone dies of a stroke (making it the third leading cause of death in the United States)
 There are 4.4 million stroke survivors
 Stroke is the #1 disabler in the U.S.
 29% of people who have strokes are under age 65.
 
Third, it's tax deductible.  If you send me a check ( email me  for my address and make the check payable to  American Stroke Association ) you will be sent a receipt from the ASA.  Or you can very easily  donate online  and print out your receipt right then and there.  

And finally, you want to support me because I really need your help. 
 
Obviously, we all don't have a lot of money to throw around.  But if you could make some kind of a donation towards my goal it would be greatly appreciated and it goes towards a wonderful program and a great cause.  Little or small, the donations really do add up. 
 
As Fred Bartles of  Bartles & James  used to say, "Thank you for your support."

      When I applied to  Carnegie Mellon University  I didn't know that only those in the utmost physical condition would be admitted.  I should have realized this was the case after my interviewer dropped me off in the middle of the woods with nothing but a map, a compass, a full bottle of water and a Modern Math final exam, and expected me to return to campus within 3 days WITH THE EXAM COMPLETE! (they didn't even give me a pencil)  

But after 4 years I knew why.  Those were the most grueling 4 years of my life.  If I had to take one more exam while holding my breathe underwater and blindfolded, so help me.  I hated that school and every professor there.  But today I look back on my time and thank the school for making me the man that I am today.  

And I'm sure Aron Ralston looks back and thinks the same thing.  That's right,  Aron Ralston , the man who cut off his own arm in order to escape from the mountains of Utah alive, is a Carnegie Mellon University graduate (Mechanical Engineering '97).  The training, the torture, the long nights alone with "Nurse Bertha" all paid off for Aron.  In fact, the quote from Aron that probably summarizes his journey the best is CMU's motto:  
  I FELT PAIN, I COPED WITH IT, AND I MOVED ON.   

That phrase is plastered all over the school - on every symbol, on every plaque, and on every Optimus Prime picture you can find on campus.  And If I had a nickel for every time I uttered this phrase during my time at CMU I would be a rich man. 
"Hey Adam, how did the final exam go?" 
"I felt pain, I coped with it, and I moved on."  

"So, what did she say when you asked her out?" 
"Listen, I don't really want to talk about it.  I felt pain, I coped with it, and I moved on."  

"How was the cafeteria food?" 
"I felt pain, I coped with it, and I moved on."  

( "My heart is in the work"  also seems to be gaining some popularity)  

So as people search for more information on Aron Ralston, trying to understand what could give a man such a will to live, I hope they realize that it came from the rigorous training and education that Carnegie Mellon University prides itself on.  

Relatedly, CMU  recently announced plans to create a Robot Hall of Fame .  What they do not mention in that press release is that each year, all new robot nominees will face each other in a No-Holds-Barred Battle Royale where only the winner will be inducted into the Hall.  Yes, that's exactly how it will work.

       New Hampshire Weeps and the Rest of the World Says, "Oh, so that's what was on the back of their state quarter."  
Poor New Hampshire.  The one thing they could latch on to as a reason for existing is no longer.   The Old Man of the Mountain  has  collapsed .  Trying to prolong their reason for being, the state of New Hampshire had previously attached stabilizing cables and epoxy to the Old Man, but, as state park official Mike Pelchat said, "There's only so much you can do."  

So now, with the Old Man of the Mountain gone, there really are only two reasons to go to New Hampshire: 
 Driving through it while going north to Maine.
 Using the New Hampshire airport as a cheaper alternative to  Portland International . 

If something happens to Maine, New Hampshire is screwed.  Rumor has it they have already started placing epoxy and stabilizing cables on Maine's southern borders.

      I think Nelly is the most misunderstood artist of the last 25 years.  Yeah, he loves to party, yeah he likes having sex, but he's also a confused kid who is struggling with his new found fame and fortune just like the rest of us.  In fact, he's written a cry for help that no one seems to have answered: 
 
"Ride Wit Me" 
  
If you wanna go and take a ride wit me 
We three-wheelin in the fo' with the gold D's 
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!) 
 
If you wanna go and get high wit me 
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y 
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!) 
  
Poor Nelly.  He doesn't want to be "3-wheelin' in the fo'" and he knows the "D's" don't have to be gold.  And yet he does and they are.  Why?  Nelly doesn't want to be smoking an "L" in the back of his Benz(-y), and yet he does.  But why?  Why are all these people following him around in the "fo'" and smoking the "L's?"  Why else?  The only reason is his money (and fame). 
 
 
In the club on the late night, feelin right 
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice 
Lookin for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home 
She can be 18 wit an attitude 
or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude 
Boo, as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on 
I peep something comin towards me up the dance floor 
Sexy and real slow 
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video 
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no? 
Her measurements were 36-25-34 
Yellin I like the way you brush your hair 
And I like those stylish clothes you wear 
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare 
And I can see you boo from way over there 
  
Once again, we find Nelly out, forced in to the playa role.  Yeah, he likes the sex, and he's not afraid to admit that.  But he's searching for this attractive lady in the club to take home more because he wants to find her, but mostly because that is what the rich, new rapper on the scene is supposed to do.  And even if he wasn't out looking, these women would find him.  Nelly really has no options - he has no choice but to move into the role that has been created for him.  His pain is so evident in these lyrics.  And yet he delves deeper. 
 
 
Face and body front and back, don't know how to act 
Without no vouchers or boozers she's bringin nuttin back 
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic 
when the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that 
Watch me as I gas that, 4.6 Range 
Watch the candy paint change, everytime I switch lanes 
It feel strange now 
Makin a livin off my brain, instead of 'caine now 
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now 
Damn shit done changed now 
Runnin credit checks with no shame now 
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more) 
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town 
I'm gettin pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B. 
Tellin me about a party up in NYC 
Can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight 
Payin cash; first class - sittin next to Vanna White 
  
He is saying so much there, it is really hard to take it all in.  What is this man to do?  He has good credit for the first time in his life, he owns a new Range Rover.  And all this money is earned the right way - through his mind not selling drugs.  He's "the mayne" and he knows it, and yet he still has to get used to this fame.  But surely he knows how to enjoy it in the mean time. 
 
And then finally we have the realization, an epiphany, if you will.  Nelly learns from his experiences and comes to a few conclusions.
  
Check, check -- yo, I know somethin you don't know 
And I got somethin to tell ya 
You won't believe how many people, straight doubted the flow 
Most said that I was a failure 
But now the same motherfuckers askin me fo' dough 
And I'm yellin, "I can't help ya" 
"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?" 
Hell no (what's witchu?!) you for real?! 
 
 
All these people that are following him around now, taking advantage of his money and fame are the same people who doubted him when he was just getting started.  So why should Nelly help them now that he proved them wrong?  And that's just it - he doesn't have to and he won't!  Sure, nobody's perfect - he's still going to make mistakes  and he's still learning to deal with his fame and fortune, and he might still choose to bring the wrong people in to his posse from time to time.  But finally Nelly realizes that he can say, "no."  He doesn't have to smoke that "L" in the Benz with all these people if he doesn't want to.  His "D's" don't have to be gold - they can be silver, titanium or plain chrome.  All that matters really is that Nelly enjoys everything he has because Nelly has earned it. 
 
 
[City Spud] 
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high 
Niggaz wanna know why, why I fly by 
But yo it's all good, Range Rover all wood 
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good 
We be no stud niggaz, wishin you was niggaz 
Poppin like we drug dealers, sippin Crissy, bubb' mackin 
Honey in the club, me in the Benz 
Icy grip, tellin me to leave wit you and your friends 
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knockin to this 
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rockin to this 
And if shorty wanna... pop, we poppin the Crist' 
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist 
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen 
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention 
See the ice and the glist'; niggaz starin or they diss 
Honies lookin all they wish - come on boo, gimme kiss 
  
So now that Nelly has finally reached this big conclusion that he is his own man, what does he want to do?  Well, everything he was doing before, but this time on his own terms. 
 
So deep, so passionate, and so personal.  And yet this man has never gotten any 'spect for his lyrics.  I think it's about time the world sees Nelly for more than just the current big rapper, but a masterful poet and lyricist as well.

       Have You Seen These Shoes?  
  
Seriously, have you seen these shoes anywhere?  I bought them several years ago at a  Nike factory outlet .  Oh the memories - I still remember that historic day.  I walked in to the store having successfuly found a great pair of cheap and unique shoes there just about a year ago.  My hopes were high as I meandered my way towards my shoe size.  "What will I find this year?" I eagerly thought.  "What will I buy, at a reasonable price, to keep my feet cozy."  Lost in thoughts of my cool, new kicks, I didn't notice the shoe box sitting in the middle of the aisle.  My feet knocked into it and I stumbled, lost my balance and screamed liked a little girl as tumbled, face first into the floor.  I looked back and finally saw the box that had just tripped me up.  Angry at first, I yelled a few choice words at the box, and then suddenly it hit me: "This is it.  These are my shoes.  It's destiny."  I am not one to believe in things like "destiny" and "fate," but when you accidentally trip over a box, you just can't question its meaning.  

So I slid closer to the box, closed my eyes and took a deep breathe.  I carefully took the lid off, faced down and opened up my eyes to see the shoes that were made specifically for me.  "OH MY GOD!  IT'S AN ELEPHANTS FOOT!  SOMEONE CUT OFF A LITTLE ELEPHANT'S FOOT AND PUT IT IN THIS SHOE BOX.  OH MY GOD THAT IS THE WOR...oh wait, nevermind.  It's just gray shoes."  And what a pair of gray shoes they were.  

They fit like a glove, only a glove that you put on your feet and that has laces and doesn't have a hole for each finger.  And as I walked around, I discovered that they had a surprising amount of cushion hidden away.  Like walking on a cloud really, only a cloud that offers support to my feet while absorbing each step.  It was as if these shoes had been manufactured by the finest tailor specifically for my feet, only the finest tailor was actually an underpaid and overworked child in Indonesia that is mass producing the shoes for the general public.  Yes, absolute perfection.  

I wore them proudly and comfortably well through the senior year of college and I continued to love them.  Two friends hated them and thought these sneakers were the ugliest things they had ever seen.  One called them "Astronaut Shoes" and the other called them "Elephant Shoes."  None of my other friends seemed to care one way or another.  And I wouldn't have changed my mind even if they did.  All that mattered is that I knew these were the greatest shoes ever created and they made me happy.  

But like any pair of shoes, their time had to come to an end.  About a year ago the heel started to wear thin and I had to set these aside for another shoe.  And as time went on, my memories started to fade.  Shoes and sneakers came and went and life moved on.  That was until Tuesday.  Oh glorious Tuesday!  On Tuesday, my mom pulled out the "ugly gray sneakers" for me to wear home.  And as I slid the shoes on one more time, all the wonderful moments we spent together came rushing back into my head.  

Right then, I decided I had to find a new pair of these shoes.  I realized I would never be completely happy again unless a new pair of these kicks were re-introduced into my life.  

So have you seen these shoes?  Because I have not.  Not since the day I bought them have these shoes ever reappeared.  Maybe lightning only strikes once, maybe fate is a one hit wonder.  Or maybe not.  Maybe, just maybe, you have seen these shoes recently, or you will see these shoes someday.  If you do, buy them for me (size 9.5; whatever color is available), whatever the cost (I will reimburse you).  I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life (or until I pay you back for the cost of the shoes plus a little extra for your troubles.  At that point we will be even) and I will once again feel like a whole person.  These shoes will be my missing puzzle piece, my lost sock that is now found, the $20 bill that surprises you in your pocket.  Please, help my wandering and lost soul find its way home -  

 help me find these shoes

      Prompted by  Steve Laniel's Top 10 list of his all time favorite films , I decided it was time to create my own favorite films list.
  Adam Gerard's Top 5 Favorite Films 
   Freddy vs. Jason   (Yu) - What do you do with the 2 greatest scary movie characters of all time?  Put them in a movie together, of course!  New Line Cinema really took a risk with this film.  Not every studio is brave enough to brush aside revenue just to bring meaning and passion to a mainstream audience.  But New Line has a long history of never cashing out (ie.  Jason X ,  Next Friday ,  Friday After Next ,  A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master ,  A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child ,  A Nightmare on Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare ,  Nightmare on Elm Street 7: Wes Craven's New Nightmare ).  From camp counselors with giant hooters to cheesy lines before another character is killed to gore galore, you can't really get much better than this movie. 

   From Justin to Kelly   (Iscove) - Similar to  Freddy vs. Jason  what do you do with America's two most favorite American Idols?  Put them in a movie together, of course!  Only this time, instead of battling to the death, have them fall in love.  This movie makes me laugh, it makes me cry, and it makes me dance my little booty off. 

   Anal Addicts 13   (North) -  Anal Addicts 1- 3  were pure genius.  Anal sex at it's finest.  But it really seemed like the directors and cast members were phoning it in for the next 9 movies in the series.  But  Anal Addicts 13  really brings the series back to its roots.  Peter North is at the helm, yet again, but he surrounds himself with an amazing cast: Anthony Hardwood, John West, Allura Eden...the list goes on.  But these are some of the best ass fuckers in the business and it really shows in the movie.  I'm not sure if the world will ever see a better anal sex movie. 

   The Graduate   (Nichols) 

   Back to the Future III   (Zemeckis) - Most people would claim that the third movie of any trilogy is always the weakest link.  But in this case, Zemeckis didn't really hit is stride until the third movie.  Absolutely brilliant!

       The  Krispy Kreme That Could Have Been 
 
I was in  Rockville, MD  this last Tuesday on the road for work when my eyes saw one of the most beautiful sites known to man: a lit  "Hot Doughnuts Now" Krispy Kreme sign .  My mouth began to water, my heart started beating faster and I began to cry tears of joy.  Even though I no longer live near Rockville, a real Krispy Kreme in  Montgomery County  just seemed like a wonderful thing.  I of course stopped for doughnuts.  

Hot glazed doughnuts were coming down the assembly line (oh beautiful waterall of glaze, how I love you) and one of the employees was nice enough to give me a free doughnut (I think this is policy at many Krispy Kremes - get them hooked like heroine with a hot free one and watch them come crawling back every day for more, mwaaahhhh!).  This calmed me down a bit and allowed me to think straight once again.  Instead of buying out the entire store of doughnuts, as was my original plan when I first saw the red light, I bought a half-dozen and a medium coffee.  As the cashier was ringing me up I realized that I had been to  this very shopping center  less then a month ago and had not seen a Krispy Kreme.  My thoughts continued and I realized that this story must be quite new, probably opening within the last 2 or 3 weeks.  I took my doughnuts and quickly ate another hot glazed.  

I then noticed to my right a paper that was entitled "Opening Week Festivities."  Looking at the dates I realized that "opening week" had begun on Monday, December 16.  It was currently Tuesday, December 17th!  I had missed the opening day by JUST ONE DAY!  "Awh shucks" I thought, and perused the opening day festivities.  When I realized what I had missed I began to cry tears of sadness and rage.  What I read looked something like this (only the bullets were actually little doughnuts):  Grand Opening Day - 5:30 a.m. on-going 
 HOT LIGHT GOES ON and Doors open at 5:30 a.m.
 First lobby customer wins a year's supply of doughnuts (52 dozen)
 Next 23 lobby customers each win a dozen doughnuts a month for a year
 First 24 lobby customers each receive a Rockville Krispy Kreme jesrey shirt (#1 - #24)
 The next 100 customers each receive a limited edition Rockville Krispy Kreme T-shirt
 Rockville High School Cheerleaders will perform a Krispy Kreme cheer
 Leslie from  Fancy Cakes by Leslie  will be building a Krispy Kreme cake.   Ribbon Cutting Ceremony - 9 a.m. 
 Local dignitaries and Krispy Kreme representatives will cut the doughnut ribbon in front of the new store to designate the official opening of the store. 

Thoughts of what might have been began to rush through my head.  I imagined myself driving the 30 minutes to Rockville every Monday morning to pick up my weekly dozen, wearing my Krispy Kreme limited edition jersey and chanting the Krispy Kreme cheer.  But alas, it was not meant to be.  Instead, I was in attendance for Uniform Day - "anyone who comes into the store wearing a uniform will receive a free doughnut or a small cup of coffee."  You know what I say to that?  "Whoopty friggin' doo."  You can keep your free coffee (I'll take the doughnut).  I want my shot at 52 dozen doughnuts and I want to hear the Krispy Kreme cheer.
  
If this isn't reason enough to dedicate my life to building a time machine and going back to December 16, 2003, then I don't know what is.

      I've never been a big  ABBA  fan, though I will admit their tunes are catchy.  So when Slim came up with the idea of buying half-priced student tickets to   Mamma Mia!   playing at  The National Theatre  (apparently everything in Washington DC is considered "national" just because it is in DC:  Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport ,  The National  Christmas Tree , the  National Symphony Orchestra .  With that said, I'm going to go take The National Poo on The National Toilet while entertaining myself with The National Reading Material) I have to say I wasn't ecstatic.  But Slim was really excited and I thought it couldn't be all that terrible, so purchase we did.  

The entire world must go see this show.  It was so much fun.  Who, besides ABBA, would have thought of writing a musical based entirely on ABBA music?  After ABBA presented the idea, who was dumb enough to fund it and turn it in to a big production?  And who were the saps that first said, "Oh, a musical based on songs by ABBA - count me in!" and turned it in to a hit show?  

Anyway, I guess at this point none of that matters.  Somehow all the greatest ABBA hits fit pretty seamlessly in to one tight story line and the songs are just as catchy as ever.  And the best part is, you're bound to be surrounded by women who either lived through ABBA the first time, or have caught on to the new wave ABBA fad.  So if for some reason you are bored by the happenings on stage, you can just peruse the crowd and be entertained by the old ladies or the college girls who are on their feet, dancing and singing along to the music.  And if you can't be entertained by some of the poppiest pop music of all time, or old ladies dancing to some of the poppiest pop music of all time as if they are teenagers again, well, then I think you have no soul and there will never be any joy in your life.  

GO SEE  MAMMA MIA! !

      **written on November 18, 2003 but not published until now**  

This evening, I returned to my  still unfamiliar apartment  after spending a wonderful weekend in  Madison, Wisconsin  celebrating the birthday of  one of my best friends .  But a long flight and a bit of  "Joe Millionaire"  made me hungry with nothing to eat in the apartment but  Reduced Fat Cheez-It Crackers  and  Rold Gold Honey Wheat Braided Twists .  So I headed out to  Harris Teeter  to see what else I could find.  

I did my shopping, found some sales, and with my little basket overflowing I headed to the express check out (15 items or less OR ELSE WE'LL CHOP OFF BOTH YOUR HANDS!).  A young and fairly cute cashier named Carole was waiting for me.  During the check out she gave me a few funny looks.  With the confidence of the new beard behind me I began to think, "Aaah, she thinks I'm cute.  Well, I don't blame her.  Look at me.  I'm a sexy bitch!"  Right.  Here was our conversation:  

 Carole: I know this is kind of a weird question but are you Jewish? 
 Me:   Yeah [slightly uncomfortable smirk] 
 Carole:  I thought so.  You look Jewish 
 Me: [not really sure if I heard her right]  What was that? 
 Carole:   You look Jewish.  I have this teacher - Mr. Goldstein - who is Jewish.  You look a lot like him. 
 Me:   Cool.  Thanks?  Have a good night.  

I ran straight home to stare at my mirror.  This isn't out of the ordinary, but this time I really inspected my face for signs of Judaism.  

Do I look Jewish?  Yeah, I have a big nose and I'm a fairly hairy guy but do those make me a dead ringer for a Jew?   This guy  has to be a Jew.   These guys  must visit the Kosher deli every day.   This  is just a shadow and I can tell the owner dreams about bagels with lox every night.  But does  this  look like a Jewish face to you?  

Seriously, I'm not sure.   You tell me

      If you do a  Google Image Search  for " cutest dog in the world ," my dog Sadie is the #15 result.  Now, 15 doesn't sound that impressive, but we're talking the whole world here.  Being 15th in that crew ain't too bad.  And take a look at  some  of  these  dogs  that  are  in  front of her; they aren't cute.   This isn't even a dog !  

Anyway, I think these results are quite impressive and it is fair for me to say, " Sadie Gerard: the 14th cutest dog in the world, not including the romance novel cover. "

      Have any of you been to the   9:30 Club ?  It's  a music venue in Washington, DC  that gets some pretty major (and non-major) bands to come through.  It is often referred to as the best place to hear live music in DC.  

The acts that hit the 9:30 Club stage vary widely - ranging from rock to alternative to punk to rap - but I'd say most of the bands are aimed at the younger generation; the under 30 crowd, if you will.  

And then I noticed that  Melissa Etheridge  is coming.  Hey, that's cool, rock on with that.  And then I noticed that she is coming for four nights in a row.  Umh...okay, rock on with that as well...I guess.  And then I noticed the price of the tickets (all general admission) - $75.  Holy rocking lesbian, Batman!  Is this necessary?  Are there that many people that not only want to see Etheridge in concert but are willing to pay $75?  

All I have to say is, thank goodness my girlfriend isn't gay, otherwise I might have to go see this show.  Phew!  Although I guess instead she takes me to movies like   Win a Date With Tad Hamilton  .  If it wasn't for the possibility of sex afterwards, I might actually prefer the Etheridge show.

       Subway Betting  

The action of Subway Betting was started in  Pittsburgh  shortly after I left  Carnegie Mellon University .  Maybe someone can remember its exact origin - the first Subway bet even - but I think this is unimportant.  What we really need to do is teach the world about Subway Betting and help them make bets on their own.  

It's quite simple really - with a normal wager one bets on whether or not an action will occur.  Usually this is done with money being the actual item that is bet: 
 Bettor: "I'll bet you $5 that I can get that girl's number" 
 Bettee: "The one over at the bar on the end their in the little red dress?" 
 Bettor: "Yeah" 
 Bettee: "Sure, I'll take that bet.  There is no way you'll get her number.  She's way out of your league.  You've got no chance.  I mean, look at you - you're balding at the young age of 24, you've got a big nose, you're not that smooth really, and besides,  you look way too Jewish for her. " 
 Bettor: "Oh, I see how it is.  You're such a dick.   Do you really think all of this because I'll tell you something else - you're not so special either!  I mean, look at those ears?  Could they stick out any farther?  And have you looked at your clothes lately?" 
 Bettee: "What's wrong with my clothes?  I shop at B-Rep.  This shirt cost me $75!" 
 Bettor: "Oh, get off your goddamn high horse already.  You bought that shirt at Banana Republic 5 years ago and you wear it  everyday "  

Well, you get the idea.  But with a Subway Bet, rather than bet actual money you bet foot long  Subway  sandwiches.  Let's take a look at the above example, only this time we'll recreate it with Subway Betting. 
 Bettor: "You owe me 3 Subway if I can get that girl's number." 
 Bettee: "3?  Alright, you're on - but there is no doubling the meat!" 
 

So if the bettor succeeds in getting this girl's number (and trust me, he won't), the the bettee owes 3 footlong Subway sandwiches to the bettor.  

It is important to note a few things about Subway Betting: 
 The bet can really be on anything - the above examples were based on one person performing an action.  We often bet on things like this (pouring water on a former student body president's chest; pouring beer on a DJ's table; getting your VW Golf up to 55 on 5th; asking a Subway Sandwich Artist whether the meat would be doubled linearly or exponentially if you double the meat on a sandwich and then double it again) but we also often bet on events out of our control: sporting events, random occurances - just about anything.
 Unless specified, bets do not go "both ways."  This means that in the above example, if the bettor does not get the girl's number, no Subway is exchanged.  Usually, if there is to be a 2 way bet, it will be for two distinct outcomes of one event.  For example, "You owe me 5 Subway if Tiger Woods wins the Masters."  "Okay, but you owe me 5 if Vijay Singh wins."
 Unless specified, there is no doubling the meat when collecting your sandwich(es)
 Though we will more often bet by saying, "You owe me X Subway if..." you can also bet by saying, "I will give you X Subway if..."
 

Subway has become quite a commodity among my group of friends and I'm told that in Pittsburgh winnings are collected weekly.  One person has even bet infinite Subway and lost.  It has been said that a select group of people will do almost anything to win Subway.  And I, young voters, can attest to this.  Please, gather 'round as I tell you all the story of one  Parag Patel  (a.k.a. "Sexy Little Otter," a.k.a. SLO) and his quest to win Subway.  

Several months ago SLO and I went to  The 9:30 Club  to see  The Super Furry Animals .  Neither of us had ever seen them in concert, but SLO was a fan and I had enjoyed the few listens I had given the band while riding in SLO's  BMW 325xi .  We got to the show pretty early and were standing around talking and making random Subway bets when SLO says to me, "You owe me Subway if we see anyone on stage in a yeti costume."  He combines this with a laugh as if it is the most random thing he has ever heard, despite saying it himself.  So I think about it and even though it feels like the odds of a yeti running on to the stage are pretty slim, there is always a chance, but what are the odds of 5 yetis running on to the stage?  So I respond with, "5 yetis!"  He tries to talk me down to 3 but I stick to my guns and eventually he accepts the 5 yeti bet.  

Eventually the band comes on, does their thing, plays a grand finale and runs off the stage.  There are 5 band members but only 4 run off the stage.  The 5th guy was kind of a DJ but instead of record tables he had a computer and keyboards.  He sits behind his computer for awhile creating all kinds of weird noises and we all wait patiently, thinking there was nothing more after he left.  

And then it happened - before my very eyes I see several men run on to the stage it  yeti costumes , grab their instruments and start playing.  SLO and I quickly count the yetis to find only 4 of them.  I celebrate, SLO cries and the band plays on.  

It turns out SLO knew the whole time that this was a possibility.  In a few previous concerts the band had played entire shows in yeti costumes.  SLO knew this information but kept it to himself when making the Subway bet.  As deceptive as this is, SLO claims he was just "playing the odds."  He'll do just about anything for Subway, I say.  

But please, don't let SLO's dirty tricks turn you off from doing your own Subway Betting.  In fact, you better get in on the Subway Betting Market as soon as possible before Subway replaces "money" as actual currency.  Trust me, this is a definite possibility.

      In my  latest  Entertainment Weekly  (starting the post off like that reminds me of the time my female friend and I had dinner at  The Caucus Room  and the waiter started off our dinner by saying, "I get  In Style  magazine - not that I'm gay or anything."  He then proceeded to flirt with my friend.) I couldn't help but notice this picture: 
 
      
             
           
      
           
                 
                
           
           
      
      
 
 
That's right,  Cesar dog food  - sophisticated food for sophisticated dogs - whose website features drawings like  this  and  this  - wants to send  me  to the  Sundance Film Festival .  And they decided  Entertainment Weekly  was a great place to tell me this.  I would love to see the research that made the three-way connection between  EW , Sundance and Cesar dog food.  Or maybe I could take a look at the survey results showing  EW  has a high percentage of readers with small dogs they considered to be "sophisticated."  

In my head I picture this is the real story - I almost hope it's true: Two major magazine publishers are in their towels lounging in the sauna complaining about how boring their lives are.  One turns to the other and says, "This should be fun.  I've got this picture of my wife holding our dog.  I'll superimpose her to be standing outside a burning building or the Sundance Film Festival or some shit like that.  If you can get this in to your magazine I'll give you 500,000 Subway."  

And yet here I am on the Cesar website entering the contest and wondering if  Sadie  is sophisticated enough for Cesar.  Bastards!

       Watching the Washington Bullets   

With my sister I recently bought 7  Washington Wizards  (who will from now on be referred to by me as the  Washington Bullets  because "wizards" is just a lame name) tickets for 100 level seats.   Yesterday we saw the Bullets  get beat up on by the New York Knicks .  Sad.  
 But a few highlights from the game:
  This  was our view.  It's the first time I've been able to watch the game with my own eyes rather than look at the giant screen hanging from the center of the arena. Most of the upcoming games I'm going to will have  this view , which is basically just on the opposite side of the floor.  

 I got a  Washington Bullets lunch box  just for coming to the game.  Yes, at my new job I do plan on bringing all my lunches in this lunch box.  

I know you're straining to see what's written on the side of the lunch box so I'll go ahead and answer that for you:  This lunch box is  sponsored by Hebrew National , once again giving support to the stereotype that Jews run the sporting world ( What do you mean you haven't heard that stereotype?  The stereotypes go like this: we control all the banks and the media, we're amazing in bed and we control the sporting world.  What do you mean you haven't heard the last 2 before?  No I'm not making those up, but they must come from somewhere.  Oh yeah, that's right ladies. )  In addition, while I will be bringing all my lunches in this box, I won't be bringing  turkey and cheese sandwiches or shrimp kabobs . 

 I snagged this ultra hip  DC Lottery hat .  And I actually did "snag" the hat - it fell from the roof of the MCI Center while attached to  this DC Lottery mini-parachute .  Note on the mini-parachute: my roommate's cat likes to wander around our apartment's balcony but we always worry she might get stuck and plummet to the ground.  This parachute might be the solution we have been looking for.  

 I got to see  Syracuse alum Etan Thomas  score 8 points, grab 5 rebounds and block 2 shots.  He's a star!  

  Quote of the Game:   "Put  the Passion of Christ  on the floor!"  No, the Bullets didn't just pick Jesus up off of waivers.  That's former Duke star  Christian Laettner .  Stay back ladies, he's married.

      Have you ever been to  urlLink Chipotle  (chePOTElay)?  This restaurant changed my life   (I just told you this restaurant changed my life and what are you doing?  You're still sitting there reading this post.  I'm saying that a friggin' restaurant was so good that my life was altered forever after eating their food and you didn't get up off your ass and run to that restaurant?  Some people I'll just never understand).  Chipotle is basically a Mexican  urlLink Subway .  Their menu is limited to just burritos, burrito fajitahs, burrito bowls and tacos.  You make your selection, the burrito artists begin to prepare your food in front of you with rice and beans or peppers and onions (depending on your order) and then pass it down the food line.  You follow your food, peering over the sneeze guard to select your ingredients (chicken, beef, pork, different sauces, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, guacamole).  And while the burrito only costs about $5.50, it tastes like it should cost  at least  $7!  

I will never forget my first Chipotle experience.  Actually, I have forgotten it, but I definitely will never forget my friend Jack telling me that I had to go to Chipotle.  He took me once and I was hooked.  Sometimes it seems like people are introduced in to your life for a reason.  Jack and I haven't talked for years and our friendship started its decline after he got me hooked on Chipotle.  I am beginning to think that maybe he was in my life  only to introduce me to Chipotle  - best friends throughout all of high school all just so I could learn about the magical Chipotle burrito.  

My work  urlLink recently sent me to Denver .  Did you know that Chipotle was started in the city of Denver?  Luckily I did.  My boss, also a big Chipotle fan, did some research from his hotel room, and off we went, in search of the first ever Chipotle.  

Since we were hungry, we quickly gave up and stopped at the first Chipotle we saw.  But while in line I realized we were in a Chipotle in the originating city of this national chain - it maybe wasn't the first Chipotle, but it certainly had to be one of the first.  So I asked the cashier.  Turns out we were dining at the  second ever Chipotle!   We had reached the penultimate of coolness.  And I think  urlLink my happiness shows .  My tacos tasted a little crispier, the pork a little juicier.  I just couldn't believe I was at the second ever Chipotle.  

But my boss and I were not satisfied.  We had to be at the top of cool.  We had to see the first ever Chipotle.  So off we went with a few tid bits of information on the restaurant's general location and a fire in our hearts that could only be extinguished with a successful journey.  

To make this voyage easier for others, the first ever Chipotle is located at 1644 East Evans, Denver, Colorado.  Thankfully, even without this information,  urlLink we found what we were looking for .  It was wonderous.  

The moment I saw that first ever Chipotle - as my eyes swelled up with tears, as my little heart skipped a beat - I realized my new dream in life.  I have to visit the first ever locations of all my favorite chain restaurants.  I had to see them with my own eyes and relive this feeling over and over again.  

But I need to be organized.  My friend Ryan suggested a laminated card that I carry around in my wallet, with names and addresses of all the restaurants I want to see.  And that may come, but I'm not quite ready for that yet.  So, in the mean time, I'll have  urlLink Optimus Prime keep track of all the first restaurants I plan on visiting .  

One by one, I hope to visit these locations, document my progress and cross them off my list.

       Just "The Orange"  
The Syracuse  Orange .  It sounds so weird.  But apparently, as a fan  urlLink I just have to get used to it .  As long as they don't get rid of  urlLink Otto  I'll be okay.  

I do find the following quote funny though. 
  We are the only school in the country with orange as its primary (official) color. You can identify some other schools that have orange as a color, but its not their primary (only) color and we want to accentuate that we are the only school with orange as its main (only) color.  

No, you're totally right.  I can't think of even  urlLink one school  that has orange as its primary color.  Seriously, there are  urlLink no other schools .  

  
I guess this means I'm buying a  urlLink new hat .  Wow, look at all that orange on the hat.  It's almost blinding.

       The List of Five (a.k.a. the "freebie list")  
Do you have a list of five?  Apparently, on "Friends" it was called  urlLink the "freebie list" .  Whatever the name, it is a list of five celebrities you can sleep with without getting in trouble with your significant other.  I have made several lists of five and each time I forget who was on there.  But it all doesn't matter because with each new list, some wonderful lady gets cut for an even more wonderful lady.  My list of five has contained people ranging from  urlLink Alex McLeod  (I had a  urlLink "Trading Spaces"  kick) to  urlLink Jodie Foster  (I...I can't explain it) to  urlLink Jennifer Aniston .  

Most recently my list included one  urlLink Tina Fey  (for consistency sake, you can check out  urlLink this link  too).  As I was contemplating making a new list Ms. Fey, though I love her dearly, was possibly going to get the axe.  

And then I saw her last night on Saturday Night Live's weekend update.  Jimmy Fallon was doing a Mother's Day rap to "Yeah!" (featuring Usher, Lil Jon and Ludacris) when Tina Fey got up to dance.  Oh my word, did she have some moves.  And she looked damn sexy doing those moves.  Instantly, Tina Fey was back in my top five and I don't think she will be going anywhere for awhile...well, that is unless I see Jodie Foster shaking her tail feather sometime in the near future.  

But the real reason I'm posting this is in the hopes that Tina Fey might see.  I've had little success with my  urlLink online declaration of love for Juli Boeheim  but you can't stop a boy from dreaming.  

So, Tina Fey, I want you.  And rest assured that I am giving you a pretty permanent spot on my "freebie list."  So if we ever do happen to run in to each other there is no need to hold yourself back.

       Grabbing the World By Its Beats  
Encouraged by over 1,000 downloads (a.k.a. 5, 3 of them by me) of my first single,  urlLink In Too Deep , I went back in to the "studio" (a.k.a. my bedroom) and slaved over "the boards" (a.k.a. my cellphone) for "hours" (a.k.a. about 15 minutes).  I'd been hearing some complaints about the songs in the club lately - things just aren't fresh and exciting anymore.  People are asking for something new, something different, and something they can really shake, shake, shake it to.  

Well, my friends, be prepared for a revolution.  Coming to a "dance club" (a.k.a. computer speakers...maybe) near you,  urlLink  A Beat is a Beat  .

       Look Ma, I'm a Musician  
 
I've always wanted to be a musician, but I've never been able to master an instrument well enough to be a professional.  That is until today.  I would now like to properly introduce myself to the world: 
World, please meet Adam Gerard, master cell phone conductor.  Enjoy his first masterpiece,  urlLink In Too Deep , created entirely on his Sony Ericsson  T616.

Burrito chompers, bol eaters, taco lovers, and more - we can all come together and be accepted as equals.  Yes, the day has arrived for all of us to speak out, to voice our love, to be proud and to know that we are not alone!  

Chipotle Lovers, it is here:  urlLink ChipotleLovers.com .  Go and share your Chipotle love.

      Please, everyone, close your eyes and imagine back to the days when you were 10 years old.  Well, wait, that won't work for everyone.  Open your eyes again, let's start over.  Alright, now close your eyes again.  Hey, don't give me that look, just do it!  Yes, close your eyes and relax and think back to the late eighties.  Isn't it wonderful?  Remember - MTV played nothing but videos, bangs and big hair were cool (oh, hey there New Jersey.  No, no.  Bangs and big hair are still cool - that guy doesn't know what he's talking about), and we were all so much younger.  

Well, in the late eighties I was about 10 years old.  And when I was 10 years old, all I wanted was a cool pair of sneakers.  Well, that's not totally true.  I wanted a lot of things, like the latest transformer, or the  urlLink Millenium Falcon , or no clothes for Chanukah.  But what I wanted  most  was a cool pair of sneakers.  And the coolest sneakers out there were  urlLink kangaROOS .  That's right, the sneakers with the handy-dandy pocket!  But sadly, though I was far from deprived as a kid, I never got my ROOS.  

Well, that is until today (not really today - more like a month ago)!  I searched high and low, near and far, and in every friggin' sporting shoe store I could find.  But I came up with nothing.  And then  urlLink Foot Locker.com  saved me.  With a few clicks and a credit card number entered, they sent me this sweet pair of kicks: 
  
with a fresh pocket.  

A pocket on a shoe?  What for?  Well, apparently it was originally intended to carry your keys while you ran, you know, so you don't get locked out.  Genius!  But now that I'm much older and wiser, I feel I don't want to limit the use of this pocket.  So we're going to play a new game I invented, creatively titled,  Can It Fit In My ROOS Pocket?   Bear with me as I explain how it works.  I find an object that might be handy to carry around in a shoe pocket and I see if it will fit.  Did I lose you?  I hope not because that's it.  Oh, and I'll document my efforts.  

So let's play  urlLink  Can It Fit In My ROOS Pocket?

      Why haven't the car companies created air conditioning for our backs?  It seems like something that would be quite simple to implement and a HUGE benefit for drivers and passengers.  

This morning I had to load a bunch of stuff in to my car (laundry - I'm staying at my mom's this weekend and she has a washing machine that is big enough to wash more than 2 shirts and 3 socks at once, unlike my washer) and by the time I was done, I was pretty sweaty (I sweat a lot AND I'm out of shape).  Well, as soon as I was done I hopped in to my car and drove to work.  By the time I arrived to my office, since my back was on the seat the entire time, the back of my shirt was covered in sweat.  "Ewwh!  That's gross!"  I know!   This is why we need back air conditioners!   

Who does a sweaty guy need to fuck around here to make it happen?!

      The first ever Dunkin' Donuts is located at 543 Southern Artery in Quincy, Massachusetts.  I was able to figure this out from a little web research and when I finally narrowed it down, I made a phone call:  
 Dunkin' Donuts Guy:   Hello.  Dunkin' Donuts 
 Me:   Hi.  Umh...this might be a silly question, but is this the first ever Dunkin' Donuts? 
 Dunkin' Donuts Guy:   Yes ::silence:: 
 Me:   Great ::silence:: That's all I wanted to know.  Thank you. 
 
"Yes."  That's all he said!  I've never worked at the "first ever" anything, let alone the first ever Dunkin' Donuts.  I work at a tiny non-profit, but  urlLink it's not even the original office .  

If I worked at the first ever Dunkin' Donuts I'd be telling everyone.  I'd be screaming it everywhere I went.  I'd run up to everyone and shake them while screaming, "Do you know where the first ever Dunkin' Donuts is?  It's at 543 Southern Artery in Quincy, Massachusetts and I WORK THERE!"  I'd say all that, while shaking them, and then I'd kiss them on the cheek, and say, "Have a good day, but be sure to stop by the first ever Dunkin' Donuts at 543 Southern Artery in Quincy, Massachusetts.  And if you happen to stop by at the right time, I just might serve you because I work there!"  And then I'd be off in a flash to share my message with the next person.  

But alas, I don't work there.  And the people that do don't seem to appreciate the enormosity of the situation.  Such a shame.

       An Open Letter to Stephanie Abrams of  The Weather Channel   
Dear Stephanie, 

On July 4th I was watching  urlLink The Weather Channel  to find out what might be in store for me before my friends and I headed out to enjoy our share of barbecue and fireworks.  The normal slew of colorful maps and boring meteorologists came across my screen.  But I got the information I wanted so I was satisfied.  Over the years I have learned to accept boring and bland from my weather broadcasters.  But now, thanks to you, I know I can expect more.  

 urlLink Stephanie , you came on to the screen and weather broadcasting as I knew it changed forever.  Your cheery voice and bright smile brought a new light to my TV screen that I had not seen for quite some time.  You informed me of the weather in such a manner that let me know you cared.  I knew that you wanted me to get my weather news but you also wanted me to enjoy it.  

However, I have no idea what you said because I was really distracted by your cleavage.  It was unbelievable.  And I'm not alone Stephanie - my roommate and his bride-to-be were also extremely distracted.  It has been over 24 hours and we are still discussing your cleavage.  

So if you could  urlLink email me  a schedule of your future appearances on The Weather Channel, that would be a big help to me and the fan club I intend to start.  But I swear, no matter what I say, I really do respect you for your weather knowledge.  

Sincerely, 
Adam Gerard 
President and Founder of the Stephanie Abrams, "Weather Channel Goddess," Fan Club.

      Many moons ago I visited  urlLink Love Cafe  to enjoy some fine conversation and, from what I had heard, some delectable cupcakes.  I was not disappointed.  

But in addition to these 2 wonderful things, I learned of a new enjoyment:  urlLink  Cricket Cola  .  Basically, Cricket Cola is regular soda but the caffeine is replaced with GREEN TEA.  I wouldn't normally care all that much about a drink containing green tea, but this is drink is wonderous.  

 
 
 
Drinking some Cricket Cola goes a little bit like this: 
 ::take a swig::  Hmmm?  It's just regular cola.  I mean, tasty but what's the big...  ::swallow::  HOLY CRAP, that's green tea!?  I'm confused, but intrigued.   ::another swig followed by a quick swallow::   I don't know why, but I have to have more.   ::quickly drink the rest of the bottle.  Begin looking around frantically for more.  People see the crazed look in your eyes and run away as fast as they can::  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Yes, it's great stuff.  But it's hard to find.  Besides Love Cafe, the only other place I have seen it is a bagel shop over in Bethesda.  

Across the street from my office is a deli that I go to alot, but I had not been in awhile.  Today I went down to pick up some food and made my way to the back coolers to grab a drink.  And there I saw it - several bottles of Cricket Cola (they have a diet flavor too, for you calorie watchers).  I'm not kidding when I tell you that I let out a loud gasp.  

And that is why I am sitting here, drinking some Cricket Cola as I share my joy with the world (Hi world.  How's it going?).  So if you see a bottle of Cricket Cola when you are out somewhere, try it and enjoy (you might have to shake gently before drinking because I've noticed that the green tea tends to settle to the bottom after sitting for a bit).  You won't regret it.
