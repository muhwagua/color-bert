      I swear that there could not be any website as bad as this! The.. well, I'm not sure exactly what language it is, but it's got funny squiggles in it... has a better option scheme and general interface than the English version!! Carrying on the aggression towards the language choices, the website has decided that English was no longer invented by the ENGLISH, but it was invented by the Americans, and that, there are even TWO different variations!! I wonder what type we learnt in Secondary school... *Growls* I was really looking forward to that movie, but now im planning to buy a copy oif the dvd and teach the dog to do it's business on top of it - it's so bloody crap!! lol. This is the only website that i can be bothered to check today, mainly because it's put me in such a foul mood, which is a right shame cause earlier I was all happy, happy with smiles on my face... Anyway. General Blog: Mostly tiresome day today, retirement RUINED by having to get up before noon! However, I do have the chance to win an iPod, so go-me!! Went to Merry Hell with Lucy today, fairly interesting shopping trip, in that I've learnt that "posh-shop" might replace my broken sunglasses if I take them in... if not, it means finding another bloody £10! After Merry Hill I took the bus to Pensnett (remind me NEVER to take the 222 again!) to see Stephanie :D! Woo! Sorry for calling around unexpectantly hun, it's just I always enjoy to see you! WOW! Prom thing tommorrow!!  The perfect oppurtunity to start that Sex-Survey Dad suggested... mwuahahahahha. Have Fun Ye All! Martin J. PS: I can't believe there's no alcohol tomoz! It means I don't have anything to blame for mine kicking Mullanal in the balls (presuming of course that it's afro has not squashed them from existence, that is)... ah well, never mind, the school would probably think it a public service and congratulate me...

      At last a free minute in my day!! You'd have thought that, what with me being retired and all, that I'd have decades full of time, perhaps enough time to fill the void that is Mullanals head - but that's a long shot. However, I've been out virtually all day picking up my suit from Nicholas Smith's - I've just tried it on to show Nan and Grandad and it fits very nicely - and then being driven around random places by Grandma for her manicure and to develop her pictures from her fancy new digital camera. It IS the best one ever!! I am SO going to steal it off her for the Prom Night... Mwuahahaha! Anyway, after this exciting journey through perpetual boredom Johnson invited me up to his and he spent basically an entire hour telling me that he thought my mum was hot, he also told me that he wouldn't mind getting a peice of somebodies muff - but unfortunately, I'm not allowed to reveal that it's Da... lol. Okay, so because of my tiring day I haven't got time to go and blogg something interesting, sorry Steph but I'm going to be even more boring than usual today :(. I'm going to post this and then maybe "steal" off with another cartoon using Google... Have fun 'ye all! Martin J.

      Ah! If only I had severe rheumatism (Don't know what that is, but it sounds cool) and arthritus in all my joints, my knee's squeeked even more than Q-Ball's front gate (Classiest Episode of Sliders EVER!) and I had a walking stick which conviently concealed my whiskey botle, I really would be a retired old man! I get up at inconsitent times in the morning, sit with my cereal complaining at the quality of the BBC nowadays and that how, back in my day, it used to have proper presenters - Ed The Duck being a prime example here - and that all the programmes are the same and how the "young don't know how good they have it these days"!. After an hour or two of that I wonder upstairs for my shower, complain bitterly about how cold it is and increase the thermostat/gas bill to rediculously high figures and then, for the finale, complain that nobody has gone and gotten me my morning paper yet. Yep. That's the first portion of my daily 'routine' nowadays... my gawd it's boring!! Can't wait until we start college and my Maths lecturer starts throwing those damned "unity" and "intersection" thingies at me, then, finally, my brain will melt away into sloppy custard (or cream, steph :P... lol, sorry) and the mental asylum will admit me - finally, escaped from the clutches of the Queen Bitch and provided with good quality padded walls!!! Lol. Anyway, this is a general post for today... I'm going to go hunting through the Internet now for some classy site to Blog (love that word) after I've sneezed and found myself a t-shirt. Have Fun, Martin J.  PS: The image below is kind of copyrighted to another site... erm, and I do admit to using paint to remove the (c) sign from the centre of the cartoon. Sorry to the artists, but I'll leave your site address as acknowledgment (attempt to avoid being sued):  urlLink Old Man Cartoon . Enjoy! &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Yo! This is me! I think this is the funniest photo of myself that  I have! Well... possibly with the exception of the pictures of me with piggy-tails! Anyway, I think you'll agree with me when I say I'm a funny-old creature, but I'm also quite charming and very, very mule-like.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Gorillas are usually thought to be polite, well-educated and generally affluent creatures, however, the exception is always prooves the rule. This rule is no exception. This gorillais to be avoided like a plague, in fact, many scientists believe it to be a plague itself. There is a theory that the gorilla was once a healthy male specimen, but at a very young age he pillaged a USB port and ever since that day it's body hair has weighed twice of it's, considerable, body mass. Since that day it's true name has been warped and twisted through myth and legend to become the name that the creature currently holds, Mullanal. An interesting feat of this gorilla was to create a "website", this terrible waste of English punctuation and grammar can be found at:  urlLink http://www.mullany.tk  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      This Blogg-it Thingy has taken me a full 30 minutes to set-up. This is, of course, down to my stupidity and not my connection speed, as that is a beautiful 256Kbs (although, Blue Yonder is apparently going to update it to 512kbs with no extra cost to myself, which I find rather strange). At this time i'm sitting in a hybrid-yoga postion (i.e. Randomly) in my light-blue jeans (the one's brought on my first shopping trip with my fashion guru Beena) and a rather disgusting Donnay top. I would usually be wearing some tight-fitting (too small) camouflage t-shirt with a "69" printed onto it, but because of the college Induction day on Friday I'm saving up on clothing options - I am SO gay!! Had my hair cut yesterday, love the colour and everything, but still think it looks to short on the top, at the moment I could swear it looks like bum-fluff because it hasn't got any gel in. Additionally, these are two of the most important websites ever. They are the home sites of the band that I helped to set-up, and am actively interested in re-joining as a 'groupee'. The better of the two sites is quite obviously Elliott's at,  urlLink Without Emily , the first website was made by myself and lacks the sophistication and general grandeur of Elliott's site (I put this entirely down to it being made through AOL, although i do have to admit to knowing less about HTML code than a kangaroo on speed...) and can be found through the bands old name,  urlLink The Country Hobo's . Please visit these sites as they are intensly hilarious and the band are pretty sharp too :P. Anyway, I'm not sure if this is the kinda thing you're supposed to write in these things, so i'm going to run off now to try and make a profile and then search through the site to see how these things are supposed to look! Until then, Have Fun! Marin J.

      You all thought it was impossible, well you might have done, if you didn't then I suppose you can ignore this first line, but I am blogging an entire Island! Woo! .... hmmm, that's actually a lot less impressive now that it's in writing, ah, this is just the proof I need to show my lack of originality and basic flair for humour... damned bob-cats!  Okay'z, you may have noticed that for the last two weeks I haven't been fulfilling my blogging duties, there is a perfectly adequate explanation for this: I was busy having my soul cursed. You heard it here first, Lanzerote curses young gay mens souls :P... for those of you who are not aware of the Book Of Lanzerote from the Bib-el, when a person is cursed by Lanzeroti their hair becomes green and they are befallen to a terrible sickness, as well as loosing the majority of their syntax... damn that Syntax Stealer!! The holiday wasn't actually that interesting at all... it involved a couple 'undred (700) volcanoes which were extinct, but I did manage to create a minor seismic shock when I walked along this ramp-thing, which I take to be proof that I am fat... the only really interesting thing about the Island was Cesar Manrique, he was this art-east who said that all buildings should only have a maximum of 3 stories and the only colours that could be used are; white, green and blue - that's why there's so many multi-story hotels painted magneta I reckon... He also erected what I'd call sculptures around the island, the majority of them were free moving (i.e, they moved via the wind) but there were a few pornographic ones! I fully deny that I was the only person to notice these sculptures!!! The only really funny about the holiday, except for the sheer amount of times I managed to bash my head on the bottom of the swimming pool, was too see Mum try and disguise her twitch whenever she was around her parents... ah, I'll never forget that meeting with Angela! lol! One good thing about the island was that everything was REALLY cheap, and I discovered on the last but one day that I had only actually spent £13 on myself so promptly brought me a bandana... hmm, you know, I really don't think I could be more boring than this if I tried.  One thing that was definitly NOT boring was yesterday!!! I spent an entire day with Stephanie!! Woo! Mucho Muhco fun!! We toured around Merry Hill for a bit and became appaled at the severe lack of 80's Style Clothes and promptly set of to Briely Hill to the Charity Shops (Well done hunni for comming in by the way :P) but we came out unrewarded  and lustful... sorry, that was back in the lifts... i mean...  ... we then walked back to my house (to work of the chocolate fudge cake...) and hired us a DVD which we "watched"   and some popcorn for us to taste   which we set about to watch for... actually, how long was it Steph, I can't remember myself ;)!. After Mum cooked us a Pizza which we barely ate I chaperoned my Royal Partner back to her home and on the way discovered the plight of Newsagents when they run out of Pornographic magazines, the size of a certain something (LOL!) and how leprachauns walk! I Love You Stephanie!  I also got to see Stephanie today again because I had forgotten to give her back her keys so her Mom had to drive her up to here to pick 'em up, soz I didn't remind you yesterday but I think i was a little overwhelmed ;) and it also meant I got to give you another hug! yay! I have socks on Steph.  Ooohhh! I've gotta be finishing this now, as the bottles are burning and I fear the bob-cats may steal my bobblehat. Have fun! Marin J.

      I still can't really believe I've never been to Birminghams' New Street to shop! The place is truly brilliant, it's SO where I'm going to do my X'mas shopping and also where I'm going to spend my Birthday money if I get enough to cover 50% of my X'mas bill from it... I really do make a fuss about my finances, but that's probably because I don't have any :P. The bullring was kind of cool, I got the impression from the Radio adverts that it was like a street marker, but I couldn't have been more mistaken, I really have got to check out the TopMan branch up top. I also really have to stop being so gay. lol I've fallen in love with this one shop,  urlLink Muji , and after finishing this post I will be checking out there website!! I also have fallen for the "proper" Oasis Shop, the one with all the Gothic clothes and the mass collection of posters - not ONE with Johhny Depp in by the way lover, I was APPALED!.  However, the best thing about today was the fact that I managed to survive of £5!!  Anyway, I have to be going because I can't think ofa nything else exciting to write about... Have fun!

      I didn't post a proper post yesterday, which was a real shame, because it means I didn't fill any of you in on either the Prom (Thursday Night) or the King Edwards Induction Day, and, unlike certain gorillas, I feel that websites  should  be updated or at least display the correct date.... Let's discuss the Prom first, just to be unusual and to follow continuaty. The Limousine was absolutely brilliant, though I suspect they serve higher quality Champagne in American Diners the ice surrounding the bottle did taste very nice - it also kept my right-foot chilled throughout the entire night. The meal was okay, nothing special really, I mean the Yorkshire Pudding was so obliviously  not  cooked from frozen, the only truly remarkable thing about the dinner was the fact that nearly all the waitresses were dressed up like very, very cheap porn actresses. In case anybodies wondering, I'm only being mean cause my finger is bleeding profusely. The rest of the Prom Night was taken up with dancing, and i loved every single minute of it, especially Robbie Williams' Angels when I got to dance with Steph - YAY!  Lol. Onto King Eds. I'm very happy to let all you people know that I made some new friends, well, three to be exact. Hannah and Georgina were the first two friends I made, we started talking after I discovered that the labels in the room were "Jam-Free" and hence the Anti-Jamist movement was made! Andy probably refuses to admit my existence, or breaks out in tears at the mention of my name, he's a terribly funny bloke and I want his hair. Oh, I've gotta talk to the College People about Schools Experience (I'm not sure I'll need it if I want to go into H.E teaching, but I'll have a nose nevertheless) and also to scout there opinions about me electing Computer Skills/ICT as my 5th A-level option.  Oakies... I think that's the catch up over and done with now, so onto today!  It was dear old Garry's Birthday yesterday, and in celebration of this momentous occasion we went to ye olde UCI to see Shrek 2. Garry, Stu, Lucas, Pete, Perky, Kali, Bethan, Crystal and myself went along. I'm in two different minds about the movie, I found it amusing, but I was slightly dissapointed by it's predictability and it's repeated ideas. However, I do realise that I'd be critical of the movie whatever it was like because of the high opinion that I hold for the original and as such, I suggest you listen to me about this even less then you people normally listen to me :P. Oh!! Some, somewhat scandalous news, Pete-Er has asked Kali "out" and Kiki said yes to him. I realise that's probably the only interesting thing on this comment, and yet it is the only thing which only has one sentence describing it, but that's what I'm like - I have misplaced prioities :P. However, good luck to the Pete and to the Kiki. To the It and the Itetta... well, there really isn't anything I could wish upon you that would be extreme enough...  Anyways, I must start my weight-lifting and then get my ye-little body into bed!  Have Fun! Martin J.

      I cannot believe it, the oppurtunity was snatched out of my hands just as I'd appreciated it's true brilliance, snatched by nothingless than stupidity.  I am talking, of course, about the Sony Ericsson T610, Mom dragged me all the way to Merry Hill (which I am really annoyed about, I planned to have a detoxicating day, after the "extreme" amount of activity I was involved in yesterday) to sort out soem problem with her mobile phone - it's my theory that it exploded from sheer adultery overload, you heard about dangerous mobilephone radiation, BUT it's been discovered they explode in your ear should you "adult" to much... lol. Anyway, she was there for a bloody 90 minutes with this sales assistant (I truly felt sorry for her, after about a minute of talking with the Queen of Adult'ing I could see her eyes glaze over as she contemplated suicide, I may send her a commiseration card in the post...) and then finally she picked up the T610, I was amazed anybody could persuade muther to purchase anything with style - however, mum's lack of reality of soon about to reassert itself!! After an hour of screaming like a baby on the bus, "I don't like this phone! It won't do what the Nokia does... What's a theme?", we finally manage to get home. Well, I manage to get home, mum manages to stay in the house for all of 25 minutes before packing her adult'ing gear back into her handbag on the way to The Carphone Warehouse to return the phone. Oh well, Goodbye Phone, you, unlike mum, will be sadly missed. Oh! The shopping trip did, however, produce one of the best lines EVER from the sales assistant: "If you ever run away to America you'll be able to use all your services". I could have DIED!!! In fact, I had to quickly disappear to the Orange store so Mum didnt see me laughing, which may have revealed my actual knowledge about her and Mustard Boy...  Oh, another complain about mother, sorry there's so many today, is that she's decided she isn't going to pay for my lunch anymore. Well, she is, but only sometimes... She's bloody trying to starve me to death! I need my food! Ever since Steph snapped me in half yesterday I've realised that I may be "slightly" underweight... lol. Anyway, I must go now, for I must have a shower and my television needs me! Have ye All Martin J. PS: Why is it that only some MSN customers are "valued"?? I think it's prejudice that is!! QUICK! To the Political-Correctness Mobile!!

      I know I've spoken before about how much of an old man I am, but now I've really kicked the bucket... i mean, swayed the hooshla...  not ONLY do i hang around for hours in my Dressing Gown (which is falling to peices... ahhh, all i need now is some moths!) for hours each morning and complain about the government - but, to be honest, who wouldn't complain about our government, I mean, IDS isn't in it for a start! I NOW cannot talk due to the state of my teeth and I am also able to remove them! It trully is great... I'm even going to buy/steal a posh glass in which too put them in each morning! Arr, Ye Rapskaligans!  Wow! I'm a Pirate Grandad!  Ohh-arr! My back doth creak!!!!   Anyway, I just thought I'd blog toi proove my existance  in this world and to apologise to the many people who I was supposed to have contacted by now...  I am very sorry but i actually have been busy either, chasing a job or fighting back the urge to kill at home... ahhh... what a wonderful life it is to be me!!   Have fun ye all,   Martin J. - The Margerine Zombie     PS: Wow, I haven't written on here bout how great it was to go around Steph's for luncheon and to go bowling!! It was fab!! I almost felt like I was accepted as a normal member of society!! Thank you to the Churms house for putting up with me, but especially mine king (K)! WOW! Also... the cinemas today was pretty rock'ish! Well... 'part from the movie being crap... but still, it was very fun and i hope you enjoyed it as well Steph and Jono :-) .... 'till later....

          Private Do-Not-Enter reporting for duty!      Right - I have had loads of reviews asking me who it was that I wrote about in   '  urlLink Tourniquet  '  -  my first ff.net songfic - and if you really feel that you need to know then well... I'm sorry to disappoint you but I have no answer to that question!  I guess the whole point of me writing it so that you couldn't quite tell which of the Ed's it was, was so that the people reading it could make up their own mind on just who they thought that person should be. Personally - I do not know who it was. I think it could have been any of them for several amounts of reasons. And so I guess that beings me to another point of the fic which would be to show that, although the three are so very different in their personality and their outlook on life and whatnot, when it really comes down to it, they are exactly the same. I guess that might not make much sense (and if you did understand it pls comment or sumfink coz I'd like to know if it's just me being insane...) but still... yeah... Sorry to leave you hanging like this, but hey... Im a mean kinda person ^_^

      Thanks for the viligant attention of my younger brother, David, Picasso has been shown not to be some genious or some 'masterpeice maker' or similar... but in fact a drunk narcotic not disimilar to Mrs Hewlit... indeed, some of his 'paintings' or should we call them 'attempts'? Have simply existed because "he had morphine that day..." - this being a prime example of such an attempt:  urlLink Picasso   Well, looks like Dave's made a career for himselfg as an art critic... though, he may not last long when he claims, "the sky isn't that colour... haven't you seen the sky? Uh? I'm confused? Why are you shouting 'Zombie' at me Martin???".... lol...  ahhh... that was fun!!  In proper blogstyle, today's been a very hectic and boring day (yes yes, the two CAN actually go together...), completely unlike yesterday! YAY! Steph, Mrs Churms and Jono took me bowling! It was greatest fun!!! :D! Yay!!  Anyways... I must go now for the bath must be claimed for king and zombie! Have z'ye Fun Martin J.

           Private Do-Not-Enter reporting for duty!       Ok, so here I am again. Night after night I sit here, staring at this damn computer screen just waiting for inspiration to hit me - similar to how I, day after day, sit at my easel and wait for a masterpiece to miraculously appear on the sheet in front of me. Problem is that inspiration never seems to hit, and that masterpiece never gets created. It's driving me insane! For at least 4 days I have been trying to write my 9th chapter of closeted secrets - and I have done about a page worth - but that is it. No more. But I am determined to get it done by tomorrow night - bloody determined!  *sigh* why can't I have been created with a scientific type mind? Like Marin! Then the stuff i come out with would probably be of some use to somene... as it stands my brain is just full of angsty and dark drawl... Can't I at least once come up with a story where people are happy? hard to believe that when I came up with the basis for 'dead popular' I originally intended for it to be a happy fic... but then look what happened! She killed herself! A happy fic that does not make!!!!  Oh well... I'm gonna stop moaning now - I'll never get me anywhere... so on to more positive things - woo! Martin! I got to see him today! Well - ok, so we went bowling with my mom and bro... it was scary.... Specially when this little kid randomly asked me whether I had a boyfriend... i was so frightened! Oh well... I can't help having hoards of admirers (I wish...)

      I am positively disgusted with the internet!!! There are over 4 billion websites included in the Google Search Engine and yet I CANNOT find one single Fan Site for one of my most reverred and respected heroes, the brilliant politician and politcal speaker (Oi! No laughing in the back rows!) that is Mr. Ian Duncan Smith. It is a terrible, terrible tragedy that such a marvel, a pinnacle of human evolution such as IDS does not have AT LEAST one fan site! Hence this blog, I invite all of you HTML programmers out there (well not one of you... eeewww... not YOU!! EEWWW!! Contamination!!) to submit a design for a purposeful and worthy website of our great hero, Ian Duncan Smith.   urlLink     urlLink     Have Fun Ye All, Martin J.  PS: This is a highly serious venture, should any uncontaminated HTML programmer find their way across this Blog of Royalty then I would ask you to submit the design for your website to either my own (Marineena's)  email address or Steph's (Captain Howdy), both of which *should* be found in our profiles. Should we find a design worthy of the great political genious that is IDS we will endeveour to create the website to the best of our abillities (please note, however, we are not rich and as such will probably be begging favours for bandwidth :P)  and will consider adding the designer of the site to the list of members to this Blog... but please be aware, this is only a suggestion and you would have to go through rigorous training, not have an afro and also wear socks.

      Mwuahahahahaha... The illegal'ness continues!! I've managed to get a free weeme this time (It's so unbelievably crappy that you have to pay £1.50 for one!) and am well impressed with it - i want that handbag!! lol.. As you can probably tell, it's a pretty crappy bitmap-edit of a screen shot... unfortunately the speech bubble was present so I cudn't replicate the supplied backgrounds if i deleted it... actually, I might edit the image an 'ickle bit more and get rid of the speech bubble, at least then it might fit in msn icon space!  urlLink     urlLink     Hmmm... not much to talk about now...  ... I'm going to wrap this up now because I'm going to go ring Steph (yay!) to see if we can arrange to get together and do something... grrr, I can't believe the parents are trying to take me to Whitby on saturday, i mean, fair play on trying to be a proper household and engage my interests (I read *most* of the Whitby Witches series by Robin Jarvis so i kinda want to see the abbey and stuff...)  but why can't they make their plans fit around mine? :P... lol, I'm ever so retarded... i mean stubborn...

      Grr!! Your a cheeky dandelion aren't you hunni? :P... I would attempt to come up with an excuse for not blogging but then I do have the intelligence of a Northweigen Bowling Alley so I s'pose I'll just have to grovel for forgiveness from Steph! Anyways, there is a slight excuse for mine absense from this world that is "Blog", I've been at a Summer School in Keele Unmi for a week.. well actually it was only 5 days but the amount of activity in that time made it feel like a bloody month! As all of you know I am a complete sadistic moron who loves to learn and as such I was most perturbed when I discovered the majority of the Summer Camp involved sport! Ergh! Sport! Us camp people don't do sport!! However, there was one thing which *could* have been worse than the general sport - Army training. Fortunately, though, I had by this time made a lot of new friends (I'm still upset Chad didn't wanna get any closer to me :P! lol, you know i love you steph!) so we had quite a bit of fun during those three hours, even if they DID get mood ALL over my clothes! tsk! On top of the grueling sport timetable we had a packed night-life planned including; discos(the best one was the best... cept for the fact everybody kept on slappin' my ass!), Irish Dancin' (that was a brilliant night.. well, cept for all the smoke in the air, I'm prettty sure the Warranty on my respiratory system is void now :(...), Glo' Bowling (Unfortunately I missed that cus of a migraine... which was a right shame!)  and a formal meal (formal my ass!)... However, we did get 7 lectures! YAY! lol, these were in: Chemistry, Law, Politics, English, Visual Arts, and sumthing else... yep, I was paying attention.. lol..  Anyway, that enough on Keele, I've still gotta admit that Oxford was a better Establishment, but there were much better people at Keele than Oxford! Today's been quite an eventful day, went car shopping (Our car MUST have mechanised Cup holders... MUST...), discovered that it costs damn £65 for the Student Bus Pass (thats a REAL saving! NOT!) and then attempted to buy a lead to connect our new Video Camera to my computer but that went to pot when I discovered I haven't got any fire-wire ports - Gerald didn't half give me a crap computer!!! Some other stuff happened of not today, but that's for private ears :P... there was one  very good thing about today - i got to see Steph! yay!  Anyways... I better finish this of now cus I'm being called for dinner in a mo... Have fun ye' All, Martin J.
