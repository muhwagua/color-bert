      Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.  When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.  The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.  It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.  Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile   There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real!  Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.   May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy.  Always put yourself in others' shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too.  The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.  Happiness lives for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.  When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.

(u know who u r hor!!) cos she's lookin for ms black n she tot i'm already in skool... well... i was still in dreamland...Zzzz  went open house, n... i was thought to be a more responsible guy (compliment?), cos i'm older than the rest.. n had gone thru army... err... well... no comments... but juz try my best, since got ppl so look up on me! LOL tried 2f04 "home-made/lab-made" chocolate... ok... juz like normal chocolate..  did henna tattoo!  ryan make a biohazard on my right hand (not enuf standard...but thanx to ryan, anyway)...  i did a ugly-supposed-to-be-scorpion-thingie on my left (honestly, look much more worse than ryan's art! LOL)  after open house, went downtown to makan b4 going jam x to watch jeremy/reb/eugene/eman/astrid's sis final round...  cherie asked: did u dye ur hair urself? *nOdZ nOdZ* cherie asked: so r the patches behind intentionally? *nOdZ nOdZ*  hmmm.. really intentionally to highlight... but it turns out to be patches... wun bother bout it at the moment... mayb when mood to cut it comes, then i'll cut... but i'm thinking of sporting my hair long.... hmm... watever... see how    then went jam x, they did pretty ok,...  well, though they din get in the top 3 but it's quite good enuf...  guys, (if u read this)... dun b dishearten, u did a good job!! Ü  jam x was pretty fine.. think most bands were performing well, except for 2 weird bands... that... err... got no clue wat they trying to do..  one of which is the so called band from fms of np... but at least 2 guys of the band definitely look older than me.. too old to look like teenage np students.. they look more like part time students ( i guess)... intially i tot how come got ah pek perform!?! LOL... n this guy in white t n black dunno-is-coat-or-tuxedo is confident enuf to shake his fat butt in front of so many audience.. he seems to be err... overdoing his singing actions (i guess).. but really admire his daringness/confidence/thick-skinness...  the other band was singing papa roach song... well, mayb i not so much used to enjoyin this kind of musik... wat it seems to me was that they r juz roaring... think i can do as well as them.. LOL...  reach home around 2300... watch the black sq box till around this time.. then here i m typing this...  wat boring life!!  should go to sleep soon...  cinderella not feeling well... wish/hope/pray she get well soon

      This is a true story that happened in Japan. In order to renovate the house, someone in Japan tear open the wall. Japanese houses normally have a hollow space between the wooden walls. When tearing down the walls, he found that there is a lizard stuck there  because a nail from outside got stuck into one of its feet. He sees this, feels pity and at the same time curious, as when he check the nail, it was nailed 10 years ago when the house was first built. What happened? The lizard has survived in such position for 10 years! In a dark wall partition for 10 years without moving, it is not an easy task. Then he remembered, how this lizard survived for 10 years without moving a single step - the feet was nailed! So he stop the work and observe the lizard, what is it eating?  Later, don't know from where appears another lizard, with food in its mouth... AHHH! He is stunted. What kind of love is this? For the lizard that was stuck by a nail, another lizard has been feeding it for the past 10 years..   And stop wondering the relationship between them: family, friends, lovers, brothers, sisters...... As the technology advances, our access to information became faster and faster. But the distance between the human beings, is it getting closer as well? NEVER ABANDON YOU LOVED ONES.

      Jurgen Vries ft. CMC - The Opera Song  I have a vision That no one can imagine I can see things That no one sees  I have the wisdom Knowledge of the future I'll take you to the end of time With me  Deep down inside me Way beyond the silence I can hear things that no one hears  Questions unanswered Better left unspoken I'll take you to the very end With me  And it's a brave new world That we live in As we lose ourselves Tonight  We have no control Of our feelings As we journey to the corners Of our mind

      currently listening to    Blank & Jones Feat Anne Clark  - The Hardest Heart   Let the morning sun proclaim  The light of the world  Let the golden day unfurl  On every wave  On every hill   Each angered fist uncurl  Caress the hardest heart  Stir the sweeping earth  Each stone  Each blade of grass   The soul of the world  Ignite a brand day  Let the morning sun proclaim  A brand new start  A brand new way

        CLOSE TO YOU  - Carpenters  Why do birds suddenly appear  Every time you are near?  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.   Why do stars fall down from the sky  Every time you walk by?  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.   On the day that you were born  The angels got together  And decided to create a dream come true  So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold  And starlight in your eyes of blue.   That is why all the girls in town  Follow you all around.  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.

        Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone I hear you call my name And it feels like home  Chorus: When you call my name it's like a little prayer I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there In the midnight hour I can feel your power Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there  I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing I have no choice, I hear your voice Feels like flying I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling Out of the sky, I close my eyes Heaven help me  chorus Like a child you whisper softly to me You're in control just like a child Now I'm dancing It's like a dream, no end and no beginning You're here with me, it's like a dream Let the choir sing  chorus Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery Just like a dream, you are not what you seem Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there  Just like a prayer, I'll take you there It's like a dream to me

         "2 less lonely people in the world" by air supply  a song which i immediately fall in love with while walkin past a pub on 22nd March wif u...  the lyrics is really meaningful, totally fit into the mood... my dear, specially 4 u!!      I was down my dreams were wearing thin When you're lost where do you begin My heart always seemed to drift from day to day Looking for the love that never came my way  Then you smiled and I reached out to you I could tell you were lonely too One look and then it all began for you and me The moment that we touched I knew that there would be  CHORUS Two less lonely people in the world And it's gonna be fine Out of all the people in the world I just can't believe you're mine In my life where everything was wrong Something finally went right Now there's two less lonely people In the world tonight  Just to think what I might have missed Looking back how did I exist I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are  CHORUS  Tonight I fell in love with you And all the things I never knew Seemed to come to me somehow Baby, love is here and now there's  CHORUS    ~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~   22nd March '03    my/her/our special day!!!

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.    Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer  than left-handed people.    Elephants are the only animals that cannot jump.    A cat's urine glows under a black light.    An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.    Starfish have no brains.    Polar bears are left-handed.    Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for  pleasure.

        let me bleed     Sleep for centuries Closer next to me Pretend the rain has stopped, a burning thought A soul is lost  Spring can make a change Miss you once again She’s hoping that someday, her prince will come To love to stay  Lay your hands across my bleeding heart Gently feel the pain please make it stop  My tears are just the same It’s funny how people change Tomorrow seems so far away Your love will never fade  Can’t say I didn’t try Those words are hard to find Remember how we slipped away My heart will always stay  If I care, I’ll get lost If I try, life’s too short

      One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all of his neighbors to come over and help him. They each grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel load later, the farmer looked down into the well, and was astonished at what he saw. As every shovel of dirt hit his back, the donkey did something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off.  The Moral: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up! Remember the five simple rules to be happy: Free your heart from hatred. Free your mind from worries. Live simply. Give more. Expect less.       OK that's enough of that crap..... The donkey later came back, caught the farmer out in the field and kicked the crap out of him. Then he went over to each of the farmer's neighbors and kicked the crap out of them too for helping. The REAL moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you!

      If I had to live my life without you near me The days would all be empty The nights would seem so long With you I see forever Oh, so clearly I might have been in love before But it never felt this strong Our dreams are young and we both know They'll take us where we want to go Hold me now Touch me now I don't want to live without you  (CHORUS) Nothing's gonna change my love for you You ought to know by now how much I love you One thing you can be sure of I'll never ask for more than your love Nothing's gonna change my love for you You ought to know by now how much I love you  If the road ahead is not so easy Our love will lead the way for us Like a guiding star I'll be there for you if you should need me You don't have to change a thing I love you just the way you are So come with me and share the view I'll help you see forever too Hold me now Touch me now I don't want to live without you  (CHORUS) Nothing's gonna change my love for you You ought to know by now how much I love you One thing you can be sure of I'll never ask for more than your love Nothing's gonna change my love for you You ought to know by now how much I love you

        Saying I  love  you  Is not the words I want to hear from you  It's not that I want you  Not to say, but if you only knew  How easy it would be to show me how you feel   more than words   is all you have to do to make it real  Then you wouldn't have to say that you  love  me  Cos I'd already know      What would you do if my heart was torn in two   more than words   to show you feel  That your  love  for me is real  What would you say if I took those words away  Then you couldn't make things new  Just by saying  I  love  you      more than words       Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand  All you have to do is close your eyes  And just reach out your hands and touch me  Hold me close don't ever let me go   more than words   is all I ever needed you to show  Then you wouldn't have to say that you  love  me  Cos I'd already know      What would you do if my heart was torn in two   more than words   to show you feel  That your  love  for me is real  What would you say if I took those words away  Then you couldn't make things new  Just by saying  I  love  you       more than words        come across these lyrics (ermm..i suppose they r...)  that's quite touchy n meaningful

      something meaningful to share    CREATING PERFECT RELATIONSHIPS? A person visited the government matchmaker for marriage, SDU, and requested, "I am  looking for a spouse. Please help me to find a suitable one." The SDU officer said, "Your requirements, please." "Oh, good looking, polite, humorous, sporty, knowledgeable, good in singing and dancing. Willing to accompany me the whole day at home during my leisure hour, if I don't go out. Telling me interesting stories when I need companion for conversation and be silent when I want to rest." The officer listened carefully and replied, "I understand. You really need television." There is a saying that a perfect match can only be found between a blind wife and a deaf husband, because the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband and the deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of the wife. Many couples are blind and deaf at the courting stage and dream of perpetual perfect relationship. Unfortunately, when the excitement of love wears off, they wake up and discover that marriage is not a bed of roses. The nightmare begins. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- NO POINTING FINGERS A man asked his father-in-law, "Many people praised you for a successful marriage. Could you please share with me your secret?" The father-in-law answered in a smile, "Never criticize your wife for her shortcomings or when she does something wrong. Always bear in mind that because of her shortcomings and weaknesses, she could not find a better husband than you." We all look forward to being loved and respected. Many people are afraid of losing face. Generally, when a person makes a mistake, he would look around to find a scapegoat to point the finger at.  This is the start of a war. We should always remember that when we point one finger at a person, the other four fingers are pointing at ourselves. If we forgive others, others will ignore our mistake too. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- NO OVERPOWERING Many relationships fail because one party tries to overpower another, or demands too much. People in love tend to think that love will conquer all and their spouses will change the bad habits after marriage. Actually, this is not the case. There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "It is easier to reshape a mountain or a river than a person's character."  It is not easy to change. Thus, having high expectation on changing the spouse character will cause disappointment and unpleasantness. It would be less painful to change ourselves and lower our expectations. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- RIGHT SPEECH There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "A speech will either prosper or ruin a nation." Many relationships break off because of wrong speech. When a couple is too close with each other, we always forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say anything without considering if it would hurt the other party. A friend and her millionaire husband visited their construction site. A worker who wore a helmet saw her and shouted, "Hi, Emily! Remember me? We used to date in the secondary school." On the way home, her millionaire husband teased her, "Luckily you married me. Otherwise you will be the wife of a construction worker." She answered, "You should appreciate that you married me. Otherwise, he will be the millionaire and not you."  Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed for a bad relationship. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUST Trust is a very important factor for all relationships. When trust is broken, it is the end of the relationship. Lack of trust leads to suspicion, suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity may result in separation. A telephone operator told me that one day she received a phone call. She answered, "Public Utilities Board." There was silence. She repeated, "PUB." There was still no answer. When she was going to cut off the line, she heard a lady's voice, "Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number from my husband's pocket but I do not know whose number it is." Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to the couple if the telephone operator answered with just "hello" instead of"PUB". ------------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL PERCEPTION Different people have different perception. One man's meat could be another man's poison. A couple bought a donkey from the market. On the way home, a boy commented, "Very stupid. Why neither of them rides on the donkey?"  Upon hearing that, the husband let the wife ride on the donkey. He walked besides them. Later, an old man saw it and commented, "The husband is the head of family. How can the wife ride on the donkey while the husband is on foot?" Hearing this, the wife quickly got down and let the husband ride on the donkey. Further on the way home, they met an old Lady. She commented, "How can the man ride on the donkey but let the wife walk. He is no gentleman." The husband thus quickly asked the wife to join him on the donkey. Then, they met a young man. He commented, "Poor donkey, how can you hold up the weight of two persons. They are cruel to you." Hearing that, the husband and wife immediately climbed down from the donkey and carried it on their shoulders. It seems to be the only choice left. Later, on a narrow bridge, the donkey was frightened and struggled. They lost their balance and fell into the river.  You can never have everyone praise you, nor will everyone condemn you. Never in the past, not at present, and never will be in the future. Thus, do not be too bothered by others words if our conscience is clear.

      A group of Geography students studied the Seven Wonders of the World.  At the end of that section, the students were asked to list what they  considered to be the Seven Wonders of the World. Though there was some  disagreement, the following got the most votes:  1. Egypt's Great Pyramids  2. Taj Mahal  3. Grand Canyon  4. Panama Canal  5. Empire State Building  6. St. Peter's Basilica  7. China's Great Wall   While gathering the votes, the teacher noted that one student, a quiet  girl, hadn't turned in her paper yet. So she asked the girl if she was  having trouble with her list.  The quiet girl replied, "Yes, a little. I couldn't quite make up my  mind because there were so many."  The teacher said, "Well, tell us what you have, and maybe we can help."  The girl hesitated, then read, "I think the Seven Wonders of the World  are:  1. to touch  2. to taste  3. to see  4. to hear   She hesitated a little, and then,  5. to run  6. to laugh  7. and to love   It is far too easy for us to look at the exploits of man and refer to  them as "wonders" while we overlook all God has done, regarding them as  merely "ordinary."   May you be reminded today of those things which are truly  wondrous.

        You are Spazzer! While you do have a nasty side, hardships along the way have made you meek and scared to show your face. However you stay true to those that mean the most to you.

        You are an Elementalist. Your magic stems from the forces of nature. You might be a forest nuturing Druid, a storm-creating Weather-Wizard or any of the many Elementals, but one thing is sure-- your bond with nature is strong. You can rely heavily on nature to support yourself aesthetically or physically for it lends you both comfort and strength. Your instincts rarely fail you. You are vibrantly passionate but are sometimes carried away by your own emotions.   urlLink   Which Magical Order Are You In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       You're as beautiful as you think you are   I THINK, therefore I am.   And if I think I'm gorgeous and more stunning than Cameron Diaz, then I'll act that way.   And if I think I'm a loser who looks like a horse, I'll act like one, too.   It's all in the mind, said Mr David Kan, Executive Director of the Family Life Centre.   He believes our "thought life" has a tendency to reflect itself in our real life, so we have to nourish the power of the mind and be empowered by positive thoughts.   For some of us, the reservoirs of our lives are running dry.   "Running on empty" is not just a catch phrase, it's the reality of their everyday lives.   When we are feeling down, it's hard to look up or imagine that things could get better.   Yet, it's precisely this attitude that we need to cultivate - the belief that things are going to get better.   If we don't do that, we are simply going to sink further into depression.   Think about it - if you have negative thoughts all the time, isn't your state of mind going to affect your attitude and actions?   Your life's reservoir would be drained by your self-defeatist mentality in a jiffy.   Many factors affect whether your mindset is positive or negative.   External factors can include simple things like being appreciated for your performance at the office, getting a promotion, or even perhaps resolving a misunderstanding.   Internal factors are the mental disciplines of life.   They are simple (but not always easy to do) things like believing you are here for a purpose and that you can contribute to the environment and people around you.   Positive belief is the first step to housekeeping your mind.   When we have a positive mindset, we find it easier to like and trust people.   Life is easier if you are genuinely able to do that.   - Skye Tan   extracted from the Newpaper, find it true so would like to share with all of you.   [copied from namida tot's pg] find it quite meaningful...

      [something from my email]   WHY ??  After spending time with Eve, Adam was walking in the Garden with God. Adam told God how much the woman means to him and how blessed he feels to have her. Adam began to ask questions about her.  Adam: Lord, Eve is beautiful. Why did you make her so beautiful?  God: So you will always want to look at her.  Adam: Lord, her skin is so soft. Why did you make her skin so soft?  God: So you will always want to touch her.  Adam: She always smells so good. Lord, why did you make her smell so good?  God: So you will always want to be near her.  Adam: That's wonderful Lord, and I don't want to seem ungrateful, but why did you make her so stupid?  God: So she would love you.

      [something from my email]  15 Things You Probably Never Knew or Thought About   1. At least 5 people in this world love you so much they would die for you.  2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.  3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.  4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.  5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.  6. You mean the world to someone.  7. If not for you, someone may not be living.  8. You are special and unique.  9. Someone that you don't even know exists loves you.  10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.  11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world.  12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you believe in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it.  13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks.  14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know.  15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great.    A Minute   They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them.

You love all warm and fuzzy items.  A little nutty at times . Sometimes you need an ice cream cone at the end of the day. Others perceive you as being child-like and immature at times.  Brownies...

A bit of a diva at times, but you have many friends.  Vanilla with Chocolate Icing ... Fun-loving, sassy, humorous. Not very grounded in life,  very indecisive  and  lack motivation . Everyone enjoys being around you, but you are a practical joker.  Others should be cautious in making you mad , however,  you are a friend for life .  Strawberry Short Cake...

      From EMAIL:   Try it out and the battery shop will close soon. If the life of your mobile phone's battery is shortening due to "memory effect" / aging, would you go an buy a new battery to replace it?  Next time when you encounter this situation, try saving your money.  Can try and see: 1.   Wrap the battery up with newspapers, put it into a plastic bag and then into the freezer for 3 days (the newspapers will absorb the accessive moisture). 2.   After 3 days, take out the battery and leave it in normal temperature for 2 days. 3.   After 2 days, fully charge up the battery and put it into your mobile phone and see (this is estimated to be able to salvage about 80%-90%) This information was provided by an engineer in a well-known battery factory.

       from email  BEWARE LADIES...................  DETECTING A 2-WAY MIRROR  How to determine if a mirror are 2 way or not ( Serious )  Not to scare you, but to make sure that you are aware. This was passed on by a police-woman who gives seminars and techniques for house wives, Businesswomen, executives.  Many of the hotels cheat the customers this way & enjoy while the Couples enjoy their honeymoon in their rooms. When we visit toilets, bathrooms, hotel rooms, changing rooms, etc, how many of you know for sure that the seemingly ordinary mirror hanging on the wall is a real mirror, or actually a 2-way mirror i.e., they can see you, but you can't see them ?  There have been many cases of people installing 2-way mirrors in female changing rooms or bathrooms or bedrooms. It is very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at ?  CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST:  Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror.  However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (Someone seeing you from the other side).  So remember, every time you see a mirror, do the "fingernail test". It doesn't cost you anything. It is simple to do. This is a really good thing to do.  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a 2-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.  Ladies: Share this with your friends.  Men: Share this with your wives, daughters, friends, and colleagues

       urlLink     What's Your One Piece Doujinshi Personality?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Analysis:   You tend to keep things simple. Food, friends, and fun, the best things in life, are always what you seek. The line between right and wrong is very clear for you and you are quick to point out when a person has wronged another. Your sense of justice is strong and therefore you need to be with people who you can respect as "good people". You can't be bothered to have a relationship with someone you can't look up to. This is awesome. You are friendly to everyone, and open, but you choose your companions very carefully, and once you have chosen them, you give your heart to them.  Friendship and love are one and the same to you, inseperable feelings you naturally have for one whom you have admitted into your trust. You don't wait for loved ones to extend shows of devotion to you, you are the one who demonstrates time and again, that you will be there for them. But because of your simple nature, you're not one to burden them with love confessions and such. You will wait until they do so first, and then you'll let out the love that you've had for them all along.   A caution:  As doujinshi Luffy, you may exhibit outbursts or strange behavior, including but not limited to, spontaneous hugging or kissing of your companions, fits of childish possessiveness, sudden girlishness, blushing, innuendos having to do with eating or references to rubber, pouting and petulance, and overly innocent ways pertaining to bathing and sleeping which may lead to the development of Rorikon in Zoro-types and/or Shanks-types if gone unchecked. Please use caution and stick close to a Nami-type and out of the water. Thank you.  You are most compatible with: A Zoro-type also takes love very seriously and would compliment your easygoing nature well. A Nami-type could really use having a person like you in their life as well, and will find your attitude and beliefs refreshing.   Advice:  Take a little vacation with someone you love. And give more hugs, your hugs are great.

      The Chicken and Horse There was a chicken and a horse playing together in a barn yard, when suddenly the horse falls into a pit. He yells to the chicken, "Go get the farmer, save me,save me!!!". The chicken goes looking for the farmer but can't find him. So she gets the farmer's Mercedes and drives it over to the mud pit, lassoes the horse, ties it to the car and pulls him out. The horse says, "Thank you, Thank you, I owe you my life." Then a couple days later they are playing there again and this time the chicken falls into the mud pit and the chicken says, "Help me!!! Help me!!! Go get the farmer!!!". So the horse says, "No No No, I think I can get you." The horse stretches across the mud pit and tells the chicken, "Grab onto my penis!" The chicken grabs on, the horse stretches back, and the horse saves the chicken's life.  So what's the moral of the story ??? "If you have a penis the size of a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up chicks"

       Food for Thot          A wealthy man decided to go on a safari in Africa. He took his       faithful pet Chihuahua along for company.        One day, the Chihuahua starts chasing butterflies and before long the       Chihuahua discovers that he is lost.        So, wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his       direction with the obvious intention of having lunch.        The Chihuahua thinks, "OK, I'm in deep trouble now! Then he noticed       some bones on the ground close by, and immediately settles down to       chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the       leopard is about to leap, the Chihuahua exclaims loudly, "Boy, that       was one delicious leopard, I wonder if there are any more around       here?"        Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, as a look       of  terror comes over him, and slinks away into the trees. "Whew,"       says the leopard. "That was close. That Chihuahua nearly had me."        Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a       nearby tree figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade       it for protection from the leopard. So, off he goes. But the       Chihuahua saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and       figured that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with       the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the       leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says,       "Here monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that       conniving canine."        Now the Chihuahua sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his       back, and thinks, "What am I going to do now?" But instead of       running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending       he hasn't seen them yet...        And just when they get close enough to hear the Chihuahua says,       "Where's that damn stupid monkey? I sent him off half an hour ago to       bring me another leopard, and why hasn't he come back yet..."        Moral of the story?        1. Don't do "backbiting", or "backstabbing". It could "backfire" at       you!        2. Never, never, never give up.        3. In the midst of your trouble, do your best to remain calm and       think of a  solution rather than panicking, and...        4. Sometimes if you can't dazzle them with your efforts and       brilliance, then baffle them with bullshit!!

       LAME ... but nothing else betta to do.. heh    Things You Would Never Know Without Chinese Swordsman Movies    Being the hero's parents will always be unlucky and will usually be killed by enemies when the hero is young, and the hero will become an orphan.  When a man is wounded and dying, he always manage to catch his breath and speak a few sentences to reveal the killer before dropping his head and declare dead.  When an old man is dying after being attacked by villains, while lying down he will ask the hero (kneeling beside him) to take care of his beautiful daughter (who will be crying).  When fighting with the enemy, instead of hitting each other, the villain and the hero will choose to hit each other's palm and stone there for sometime before pushing each other away... and one of them will spill blood out of his mouth.  Skilled people are able to fly over rooftops, up trees and across distances without any sweat. But when travelling to towns and villages, they still have to walk or ride horses.  When saying goodbye to other skilled fighters, they will cover their right fist with their left palm and jumping out of camera screen (assuming you know they actually fly off into the sky).  The heroes need not have to work for money, but will always have golds and silvers with them to pay for their dishes.  The inn is such an up-to-date information-centre that when having lunch at the inn, you can always overhear gossips of latest news on what's happening in the pugilistic-world. And usually the gossips come from a few goons at the next table.  Assassins seem to have some kind of agency for employments --they always wear the same standard uniform, black cloth all over revealing only the eyes.  The heroes and villains will meet each other very often no matter how big the country is and no matter where they are.  It's easy to immobilize someone - just touch someone with your fore finger and middle finger anywhere on his body and he will not move... but he still can curse and swear.  To cure an immobilization, just anyhow tap your fingers all over his body again.  Healing internal wounds in the body is as easy as sitting down cross-legged, palms on the knees and smoke coming out from the head.  People like to pass short messages on paper with flying darts to show off their darting skills.  When committing suicide, people are so lazy that they choose to hit the forehead with their own palm.  The villains have some kind of strange habit that they like to stay in a secret underground compartment just behind the walls of their room, usually opened up by turning a small statue.  When chasing someone, people tend to shout at the runner and order him to stop...as if he will obey.  Nobel's invention of explosives in 1866 is in fact useless. Highly skilled people in the pugilistic world during ancient times already know how to cause explosions with bare hands.  Highly skilled villains have the power to destroy rocks, but do not have the power to kill the hero.  Two highly skilled persons are so nervous in their duel that they keep talking and criticizing each other before they actually start the fight.  People in the pugilistic world are so free that they don't have to work. They attend gatherings, meetings everytime and nose around other people's matter.

       Left brain and right brain co-ordination! Try this!   While sitting at your desk make clockwise circles with your right foot. While doing this, draw the number "6" in the air with your right hand.  Your foot will change direction!!!

      something meaningful i've read:   Everything in life has a bright and a dark side, so.. life is never black or white... it is grey. And I'll keep insisting on that. Of course that when we're in a cage, when everything seems wrong and sucky and we feel that there's no more reason to life, it's exactly the opposite. Those are the times we are at the bottom of the pool... there's no place else to go but up, u know? We are already at the bottom, now all we need is impulse that our feet are going to create when they reach the pool's floor and propel us up to the surface again. It's all that we need, so we have to pay attention to that. It's exactly when hope seems to fail that something makes us come back with full energy. We shouldn't give in to sadness, anger and bad feelings... we shouldn't blame anything or anyone for our sucky lives. We are responsible for our lives. When WE want to get out of the shit, we do. But it's very difficult since society has led us to believe we can't really do anything more than just follow their fuckin' rules and be cattle just life most of the people in the world. That's why taking the blue pill seems better than taking the red one. But, sincerely, I don't think so. It's all about Plato and his theories... it all comes back to him. So, going against all this makes us very tired and unhappy... unsatisfied... depressed, helpless... sick. But "everything's not lost"... everything has a way out. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel. Don't panic, don't get desperate. It's worse. Instead, calm down, look around, see the bright points, analyse... you'll see that there are a lot of good things you're leaving behind or taking for granted just for the sake of enphasizing the bad aspects of your life. When we start to value the simplest and purest things of our life (even when they seem only a few), we start to feel better about ourselves and the world. And no one can really affect us, even if they try. Don't give in to madness and fear and your weaknesses and weak people who want you to join them in their death. Follow the white rabbit. Free yourself from them. Destroy the matrix!!

      Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. Love does not demand its own way. Love is not irritable,  and it keeps no record of when it has been wronged.  It is never glad about injustice  but rejoices whenever the truth wins out.  Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful,  and endures through every circumstance.  Love will last forever.

       A guy was playing golf one day and he got lost. He saw a lady up ahead of him and went to her and said,"Can you please help me, I don't know what hole I'm on." She told him "You are one hole behind me. I'm on 7; you're on 6." He thanked her and continued playing golf. Later he got lost again. He saw the same lady and went to her again kind of embarrassed. "I'm sorry to bother you again but I'm lost again, can you please tell me what hole I'm on." She told him "you are one hole behind me. I'm on 14; you are on13." Again he thanked her and continued playing golf. When he finished he saw her in the clubhouse. He went up to her and asked if he could buy her a drink for helping him out. She accepted.    As they were drinking and talking he asked her what she did for a living.  "I'm in sales." He replied, "no kidding so am I. What do you sell?" She said it's too embarrassing to tell. But after he kept pleading to know what she sold she said she'd tell him if he promised not to laugh. He promised. She said, "I sell WHISPER (Sanitary Napkins)" . He immediately fell to the floor laughing hysterically. She said, "You promised you wouldn't laugh". He replied, "I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it. I sell toilet paper........ I'm still one hole behind you."

      read it in someone's blog while blog-surfing...  meaningful   Everyone is precious in the eye of someone. Most importantly is to find that someone who appreciate you as who you are.   There are a lot of stars in the sky. Not everyone of them shines as brightly as the others. But don't just look at the brightest. There are some that are not so bright, but that is because you have not found the gems in them. Some takes time to be discovered, some only emerge upon deeper interaction. When you find the correct one, they will becomes the brighest stars in the sky. And they shine just for you. They becomes special as well, just like the moon.   Have you found your star?  If not, they will eventually come to you. Take time to look around you... If you have, make sure you are worth it. Make sure you treasure what you have now. Make sure you make yourself special. Make sure you appreciate your partner.  'There is only one moon in the sky but stars are plentiful '...

        You're Most Like The Season Winter ...  You're often depicted as the cold, distant season. But you're incredibly intelligent, mature and independant. You have an air of power around you - and that can sometimes scare people off. You're complex, and get hurt easily - so you rarely let people in if you can help it. You can be somewhat of a loner, but just as easily you could be the leader of many. You tend to be negative, and hard to relate to, but you give off a relaxed image despite being insecure - and secretly many people long to be like you, not knowing how deep the Winter season really is.  Well done... You're the most inspirational of seasons :)  urlLink   ?? Which Season Are You ??    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    i should b a mixture of autumn n winter    You're warm, and the most approachable. You have that gentle prescence about you. People can relate to you, and find you easy company. However it's likely you've been hurt in the past and it has left you scarred so things can become rather chilly with you at times. Being the third Season in, you're mature, trustworthy and loyal to your friends but prone to depression and negative thinking.

       They have been married for two years. He loves literature and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography and he handle their wedding photos. He loves her very much. Likewise with her. She has a quick temperand always bullies him. He is a gentleman and always gives in to her.     Today, she's being wilful again.     Her : "Why can't you be the photographer for my friend's wedding? She promised she'd pay."   Him : "I don't have time that day."  Her :"Humph!"   Him : "Huh?"   Her : "Don't have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all the time you need."   Him : "I... someone will definitely recognize my work some day."   Her : "Humph! I don't care, you'll have to do it for her.! "   Him : "No."   Her : "Just this once?"   Him : "No."      Negotiation's broken. So, she gave the final warning: "Give me a Yes within three days, or else..."     First day. She "withheld" the kitchen, bathroom, computer,refrigerator, television, hi-fi... Except the double bed, to show her "benevolence".     Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didn't mind, as he still has some cash in his pockets.     Second day. She conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets and warned, "Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences."     He's nervous now. That night, on the bed, he begs for mercy,  hoping that she'll end this state. She doesn't give a damn. No way am I giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees.     Third day. Night. On the Bed. He's lying on the bed, looking to one side. She's lying on the bed, looking to the other side.     Him : "We need to talk."   Her : "Unless it's about the wedding, forget it."   Him : "It's something very important."     She remains silent.     Him :"Let's get a divorce."     She did not believe her ears.    Him : "I got to know a girl."     She's totally angry, and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest. Probably from his undershirt pocket, that's the only place she didn't go through yesterday. How careless.    Him : "She's a nice girl."     Her tears fell.     Him : "She has a good personality too."     She's heartbroken because he puts a photo of some other girl close to his heart.    Him : "She says that she'll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we got married."     She's very jealous because she said the same thing in the past.     Him : "She loves me truly. "     She wishes to sit up and scream at him "Don't I?"     Him :  "So, I think she won't force me to do something that I don't want to do."     She's thinking, but the rage won't subside.     Him : "Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?"     Her : ".....!"     He brings the photo before her eyes. She's in a total rage, hits his hand away and leaves a burning slap on his face.    He sighs. She cries.     He puts the photo back to his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket.     He turns off the light, and sleeps. She turns on the light, and sits up. He's asleep. She lost sleep. She regrets treating him the way she treated him.     She cried again, and thought about a lot of things. She wants to wake him up. She wants to have a intimate talk with him. She doesn't want to push him anymore. She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks.     She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry and she wanted to laugh.     It's a nicely taken photo of herself. A photo he took for her. She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek.     He smiled. He was just pretending to be asleep.     "You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."

      came upon this story;  translated from a korean love story ***   Doll  I have a boyfriend who grew up with me.  His name is Jin.   I always thought of him as a friend until last year, when we  went to a trip from a club. I found that I fell in love with  him.   Before that trip was over, I took a step and confessed my  love for him.   And soon, we became a pair of lovers, but we loved each  other in different ways.   I always concentrated on him only, but by his side, there  were so many other girls.   To me, he was the only one, but to him, maybe I was just  another girl?   "Jin, do you want to go watch a movie??"I asked.   "I can't"  "Why? You need to study at home??" I felt disappointment  grabbing me.   "Going to meet a friend?"  He was always like that.  He met girls in front of me, like it was nothing.   To him, I was just a girlfriend.  The word love only came out from my mouth.   Since I knew him, I had never heard him say i love you?  before.   To us, there weren't any anniversaries at all.  He didn't say anything from the first day and it continued  till 100 days.. 200days..  Everyday, before we say goodbye, he would just hand me a  doll, everyday, without fail. I don't know why.   Then one day...  Me: Um, Jin, I ?   Jin: What? don't drag, just say..   Me: I love you.   Jin: erm.. just take this doll and go home.   That was how he ignored my three words and handed me  the doll.   Then he disappeared, like he was running away.  The dolls I received from him everyday, filled my room,  one by one.  Then one day came, my 15th year old birthday.   When I got up in the morning, I pictured a party with him,  and stranded myself in my room, waiting for his call.   But then, lunch passed, dinner passed.. and soon the sky was  dark... he still didn't call.   It was already tiring to look at the phone anymore.   Then around 2am in the morning, he suddenly called me  and woke me from my sleep. He told me to come out of my  house.   Still, I felt joy and I ran out happily.   Me: Jin?   Jin: Here.. take this?   Again, he handed me a little doll.   Me: What's this?   Jin: I didn't give it to you yesterday, so I am giving it  to you now. I'm going home now, bye.   Me: Wait, wait! Do you know what today is?   Jin: Today? Huh?   I felt so sad, I thought he would remember my birthday.  He turned around and walked away like nothing had  happen.   Then I shouted.  "Wait!!"  Jin: You have something to say?   Me: Tell me, tell me you love me?   Jin: What?!   Me: Tell me   I put my pathetic self behind and clung on to him.   But he just said simple cold words and left.   "I don't want to say that I love someone so easily, if you  are desperate to hear it, then find someone else.  That was what he said. Then he ran off.   My legs felt numb and I collapsed to the ground. He  didn't want to say it easily?   How could he?   Maybe he is not the right guy for me...  After that day, I stranded myself at home crying, just  crying.   He didn't call me, although I was waiting.   He just continued handing me a little doll every morning  outside my house.   That's how those dolls piled up in my room everyday.  After a month, I got myself together and went to school.   But what made the pain resurface was that I saw him on  a street with another girl?   He had a smile on his face, one that he never showed  me.  I ran straight back home and looked at the dolls in my  room, and tears fell.  Why did he gave these to me?   Those dolls are probably picked out by some other girls.  In a fit of anger, I threw the dolls around.   Then suddenly, the phone rang. It was him.   He told me to come out to the bus stop outside my house.   I tried to calm myself down and walked to the bus stop.   I kept reminding myself that I am going to forget him,   that it's going to end.   Then he came into my sight, holding a big doll.   Jin: Jo, I thought you were pissed, you really came?   I couldn't help hating him, acting like nothing had happen  and joking around.   Soon, he held out the doll as usual?   Me: I don't need it.   Jin: What? why?   I grabbed the doll from his hands and threw it on the road.   Me: I don't need this doll, I don't need it anymore!! I don't want to see a person like you again!   I spitted out all the words that were inside me. But unlike  other days, his eyes was shaking.   "I'm sorry." He apologized in a tiny voice.   He then walked over to the road to pick up the doll.  Me: You stupid! Why are you picking up the doll?! Just  throw it away!!!   But he ignored me and just went to pick the doll.   Then...  Honk~ Honk~   With a loud honk, a big truck was heading towards him.   "Jin! Move! Move away!"I shouted.  But he didn't hear me, he squatted down and picked up the  doll.   "Jin, move!"  HONK~!!   "Boom!"That sound, was terrifying.   That's how he went away from me.   That's how he went away without even opening his eyes to  say one word to me.   After that day, I had to go through everyday with guiltiness  and the sadness of losing him.   And after spending two months like a crazy person, I took out the dolls.   Those were the only gifts he left me since the day we  started going out.   I remembered the days I spent with him and started to  count the days when we were in love.  One, Two, three...   That was how I started to count the dolls.  Four hundred and eighty four... four hundred and eighty  five...  It all ended with 485 dolls.   I then started to cry again, with a doll in my arms.   I hugged it tightly, then suddenly,   " I love you~, I love you~"   I dropped the dolls,shocked.   i... lo..ve.. you???   I picked up the dolls and pressed its stomach.   " i love you~ I love you~"   It can't be!   I pressed all the dolls' stomach as it piled on the side.   "i love you~"  "i love you~"   "i love you~"  Those words came out non-stop.   I love you.   Why didn't I realize that?   That his heart was always by my side, protecting me.   Why didn't I realize that he love me this much?   I took out the doll under the bed and pressed its stomach,   that was the last doll, the one that fell on the road.   It had his blood stain on it.   The voice came out, the one that I was missing so much...  "Do... Do you know what today is? We've been loving each  other for 486 days. Do you know what 486 is? I couldn't  say I love you.. since I was too shy... If you forgive me and  take this doll, I will say that I love you everyday...till I die.. Jo...I love you...   The tears came flowing out of me. Why? Why? I asked  god, why do I only know about all this now?   He can't be by my side, but he loved me until his last  minute...   ***

      Imagine a clear blue sky without a cloud in sight. Just thinking about it should give your spirits a little lift. Now turn your mind's eye down to survey the landscape. Which of the following scenes feels most calming and relaxing to you?   1. A white snowy plain. 2. A blue seascape. 3. A green mountain. 4. A field of yellow flowers.   [The scene you pictured contrasted against that clear blue sky reveals  a hidden talent that resides in the depths of our untroubled mind. ]   1. A white snowy plain.    You are blessed with a special sensitivity that allows you to comprehend situations at first glance and decipher complex problems without needing any proof or explanation. You have what it takes to be a clear-sighted decision maker and even something of a visionary. Always trust your first intuitions; they will guide you well.    2. A blue seascape.   You have a natural talent for interpersonal relations. People respect your ability to communicate with others and the way you help bring diverse groups together. Just by being around, you help others work more smoothly and efficiently, making you an invaluable member of any project or team. When you say, "Nice job. Keep up the good work," people know you mean it. So it means that much more to them.   3. A green mountain.  Your gift is for expressive communication. You always seem to be able to find the words to express the way you feel, and people soon realize it's exactly how they were feeling, too. They say that joy shared is multiplied, while shared grief is divided. You always seem able to help others find the right side of that equation.   4. A filed of yellow flowers.  You are a storehouse of knowledge and creativity, bursting with ideas and almost infinite potential. Keep attuned to the feelings of others and never stop working on building your dreams, and there is nothing you cannot achieve.

      You are standing in front of a painting at an art museum, hands clasped behind your back as you try to take it in, when a total stranger comes up alongside you and says something to you. Which of the following does the stranger say?   1. "Isn't that a beautiful picture?" 2. "What do you think of this painting?" 3. "Excuse me, do you have the time?" 4. "You know, I happen to be a painter myself."    [In this imaginary scenario, the words the stranger spoke actually reflect how you react in chance encounters and when meeting others. Your answer reveals  what kind of impression you make when meeting someone for the first time. ]   1. "Isn't that a beautiful picture?"    Your friendly and positive nature creates a great first impression on almost everyone you meet. Your only concern should be that people may not take you seriously at first.    2. "What do you think of this painting?"   You're the type who likes to feel out the other's temperament before committing yourself to anything. People can sense that hesitancy, and it may color their reactions to you. You won't step on any toes with your cautious approach, but you may end up living on the people's terms.   3. "Excuse me, do you have the time?"   To half the world you seem like an all right sort, but to the other half you look just a little strange. You create a first impression of living life at your own pace and maintaining an individuality that some would call eccentric. You don't place much importance on what others may be thinking or feeling. For better or worse, therein lies the secret to you.   4. "You know, I happen to be a painter myself."   On first meeting someone, you come across as a little bit nervous and overeager. Maybe you're just trying too hard to be liked, but the harder you try, the worse impression you make. Don't worry so much about making people think you're great - they'll like you better if you just loosen up and relax.

      One day a blue bird suddenly flies through a window into your room and is trapped. Something about this lost bird attracts you, and you decide to keep it. But to your surprise, the next day the bird has changed clorfrom blue to yellow! This very special bird changes color again overnight - on the morning of the third day it is bright red, and on the fourth it turns completely black. What color is the bird when you wake up on the fifth day?   1. The bird doesn't change color; it stays black. 2. The bird turns back to its original blue. 3. The bird turns white. 4. The bird turns golden colored.    [The bird that flew into your room seemed like a symbol of good fortune, but suddenly it changed color, making you worry that happiness would not last. Your reaction to this situation shows  how you respond to difficulties and uncertainty in real life. ]   1. Those who said the bird stays black have a pessimistic outlook.    Do you tend to believe that once a situation goes bad, it never really returns to normal? Maybe you need to try thinking, If this is as bad as it gets, it can't get any worse. Remember, there's no rain that doesn't end and no night o dark that there's no dawn the next day.    2. Those who said the bird turns blue again are practical optimists.   You believe that life is a mix of good and bad and that it doesn't pay to fight against that reality. You accept adversity calmly and let things run their course without undue stress or worry. This outlook lets you ride out the waves of adversity without being swept away.   3. Those who said the bird turns white are cool and decisive under pressure.   You don't waste time on fretting and indecision, even when a crisis develops. If a situation gets too bad, you feel it's better to cut your losses and look for another route to your goal rather than getting bogged down in needless grief. this proactive approach means that things seem to just naturally go your way.   4. Those who said the bird turns golden can be described as fearless.  You don't know the meaning of pressure. To you, every crisis is an opportunity. You might be compared with Napoleon, who said, ". . . impossible: the word is not French." But be careful not to let your boundless confidence get the best of you. It's a very fine line between fearless and foolhardy.

      You're walking down the street, thinking of other things, when you stumble into a garbage can on the sidewalk and knock it over. What comes spilling out from under the lid?  1. Nothing comes out - the can was empty. 2. A pile of loose trash spills out onto the street. 3. Apples cores, chicken bones, and other raw garbage. 4. A well-tied black plastic garbage bag.   [In your carelessness you overturned a garbage can, dumping out something that had been neatly shut away and exposing for all the world to see. Your image of the can's contents reveal  things inside you that you try to hide from public view.  ]   1. Nothing comes out - the can was empty.   People who gave this answer tend to live their lives without making displays or false pretenses. What you see is what you get. It's this simple honesty that gives them their charm.   2. A pile of loose trash spills out onto the street.    Those of you who said the can was full of loose trash may seem to be straightforward and forthright to others but actually have a pile of unexpressed feelings locked up within. You may notice these feelings only as general sense of frustration, but when you think about it, aren't there places where you've been holding back from saying the things you really feel?    3. Apples cores, chicken bones, and other raw garbage.   People who imagined a pile of kitchen waste are suppressing their appetites and the natural desire for food. Maybe you're on (or just avoiding) a diet. Or trying to save money by cutting back on eating expenses. Whatever the case, it's taking its toll on you. There's no need to overdo it, but it might do you good to spend a well-earned night out at a restaurant with friends.   4. A well-tied black plastic garbage bag.  People who saw a neatly tied garbage bag has a strong sense of self-control. Maybe too strong. You hate to show weakness or make complaints - your pride won't allow it. But letting others know how you really feel is no sign of weakness. Loosen up the drawstrings and let in some air before all that garbage goes bad and starts to smell.

       urlLink Are you the scientific or artistic brain?   You're dominated by your right brain, which makes you the artist. The degree in which you're dominated by the artistic brain depends on your score. The higher your score is, the more dominate this side of the brain is.  Not only are you highly creative, but you're also very emotional with a tendency toward sadness and despair. You have great spatial ability and are good at recognizing patterns. You would be at your best in a creative field such as graphical art, creative writing, poetry, music, drama, photography, etc.   Though the left brain has given man the means of survival, the abilities you possess to create and inspire has given humanity a reason to survive.

       From the very beginning, girl's family objected strongly on her dating this guy, saying that it has got to do with family background, & that the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.  Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrelled very often. Though the girl loved the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your love for me?" As the guy is not good with his words, this often caused the girl to be very upset. With that & the family's pressure, the gal often vent her anger on him. As for him,.. he only endured it in silence.  After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated & decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?"  The girl agreed, & with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in & agreed to let them get married. So before he left, they got engaged. The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails & phone calls. Though it was hard, but both never thought of giving up.  One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. when she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she had lost her voice....  The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry,.. it's still just silence cry that accompanied her. Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know. & not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.  With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions & millions of reply, countless of phonecalls,.. all the gal could do, besides crying, is still crying.... The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything & be happy. With a new environment, the gal learn sign language & started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her friend came & told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him.  A year has passed & her friend came with an envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding. the gal was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.  He used sign language to tell her "I've spent a year to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. The gal finally smiled.

      A radio station in Australia recently ran a phone-in competition to find the most embarrassing moments in listeners lives. The following are the Final four place getters:  4th place "While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some pent-up energy & started to run  amuck. I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust & annoyance from other patrons. I told her that if she didn't start behaving herself right now, she would be punished. To my horror, she looked me in the eye & said in a voice just as threatening, "If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!". The silence was deafening, after this enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped what they were doing! I mustered the last of my dignity & walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last thing that I heard as the door closed behind me were the screams of laughter."  3rd place "It was the day before my 18th birthday. I was living at home, but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after making love, we heard the telephone ringing  downstairs. I suggested to my girlfriend  that I give her a piggy-back ride to the phone.  Since we didn't want to miss the call, we didn't have time to get dressed. When we got to  the bottom of the stairs, the lights suddenly came on & a  whole crowd of people yelled "SURPRISE!" My entire family, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins & all of  my friends were standing there! My girlfriend & I were frozen to the spot in a state of shock & embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no-one in my family has planned a surprise party again."  2nd place "A lady picked up several items at a discount store. When she finally got up to the checkout, she learned that one of the items had no price tag. Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on the public address system & boomed out for all the store to hear. "PRICE CHECK ON LANE 13. TAMPAX, SUPERSIZE." That was bad enough, but somebody at the rear of the store apparently misunderstood the word "Tampax" for "Thumbtacks". In a very business-like tone, a voice boomed back over the public address system: DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU BELT IN WITH A HAMMER?"  AND THE WINNER IS ... ! This one happened at a major Australian University in October last  year. In a biology lecture, a professor was discussing the high glucose levels found in semen. A young female freshman, raised her hand & asked, "If I understand what you are saying, there is a lot of glucose in male semen, as in sugar?" That's correct." responded the professor, going on to add some statistical data. Raising her hand again, the girl asked, "Then why doesn't it taste sweet?" After a stunned silence,  the whole class burst out laughing, the poor girl turned bright red & as she realised exactly what she had inadvertently said (or rather implied), she picked up her books & without a word walked out of the  class & never returned. However, as she was going out of the door, the professor's reply was  a classic. Totally straight-faced, he answered her  question, "It doesn't taste sweet because the taste-buds for sweetness are on the tip of your tongue & not in the back of your throat!"

      meaningful story to share  Twenty years ago, I drove a cab for a living. It was a cowboy's life, a life for someone who wanted no boss. What I didn't realize was that it was also a ministry.   Because I drove the night shift, my cab became a moving confessional. Passengers climbed in, sat behind me in total anonymity, and told me about their lives. I encountered people whose lives amazed me, ennobled me, made me laugh and weep.   But none touched me more than a woman I picked up late one August night.   I was responding to a call from a small brick fourplex in a quiet part of town. I assumed I was being sent to pick up some partiers, or someone who had just had a fight with a lover, or a worker heading to an early shift at some factory for the industrial part of town.   When I arrived at 2:30 a.m., the building was dark except for a single light in a ground floor window. Under these circumstances, many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a minute, then drive away.    But I had seen too many impoverished people who depended on taxis as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door. This passenger might be someone who needs my assistance, I reasoned to myself. So I walked to the door and knocked.   "Just a minute," answered a frail, elderly voice.    I could hear something being dragged across the floor. After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 80s stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940s movie.   By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.   "Would you carry my bag out to the car?" she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm and we walked lowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness.   "It's nothing," I told her. "I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated."   "Oh, you're such a good boy," she said.   When we got in the cab, she gave me an address, then asked, "Could you drive through downtown?"   "It's not the shortest way," I answered quickly.   "Oh, I don't mind," she said. "I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice."   I looked in the rearview mirror. Her eyes were glistening.   "I don't have any family left," she continued. "The doctor says I don't have very long."   I quietly reached over and shut off the meter. "What route would you like me to take?" I asked.   For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds. She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been allroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.   As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, "I'm tired. Let's go now."   We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.   Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her.   I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.   "How much do I owe you?" she asked, reaching into her purse.   "Nothing," I said.   "You have to make a living," she answered.   "There are other passengers," I responded.   Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly.   "You gave an old woman a little moment of joy," she said. "Thank you."   I squeezed her hand, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me, a door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.   I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the rest of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten an angry driver, or one who was impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away?   On a quick review, I don't think that I have done anything more important in my life. We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unaware - beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one.    People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel.     hmmm... really? it seems like some dun. they might not even care.. r they people?...

       Are you drinking the right type of tea?  1. People who use their "brain" to work or students who study  hard day and night - should drink more Chrysanthemum Tea.  2. People who need a lot of body energy to work or those people  that do a lot of exercise everyday - should drink Wu Loong Tea.  3. People who travel on a bike or work in dirty and poluted  places - should drink Green Tea.  4. For those people who likes to sit down all day long and not  doing anything even exercising --- must drink Green Tea and Flower Tea.  5. People who smoke and drink a lot of alcoholic drinks --- should  drink more Green Tea.  6. Carnnivore ( those people who must eat meat at least once a day, or feel sick or not feeling well --- try to drink some Wu Loong Tea.  7. Those people who go to the washroom too often or too less ---  should drink more Honey Tea  8. People with high cholesterol and high blood pressure --- Wu  Loong Tea, Green Tea.  9. Those who work with computers everyday --- need to drink a Lot of  Tea (any tea will do). Whenever you are working with the computer,  you should make some tea, drink it when you are free.  Drinking Tea is healthy, it can protect and prevent the harmful ultraviolet light from harming us (when using computer).  Furthermore, it can also cure us when we are tired and help making our body feel fresh again.

      broke wanna look for job  bored surf net found this   The Truth About Girls  1. When a girl says she's sad, but she isn't crying, it means she's crying in her heart.  2. When she ignores you after you've done something wrong, it's best to give her some time to cool down before touching her heart with an apology.  3. A girl can't find anything to hate about the guy she loves   4. If a girl loves a guy, he will always be on her mind every minute of the day, even though she flirts with other guys.  5. When the guy she likes smiles and stares deep into her eyes, she will melt.  6. A girl likes to hear compliments, but usually is not sure how to react to them.  7. When a particular guy flirts with a girl very often, a girl would start thinking the guy likes her. So if you treat a girl just as a friend, go easy on the smiles and stare 'kie?  8. If you don't like a girl who likes you, break it to her gently.  9. If a girl starts avoiding you after you reject her, leave her alone for a while. If you still treat her as a friend, talk to her.  10. Girls enjoy talking about what they feel. Music, poetry, drawings and writing are ways of expressing themselves  11. Never tell a girl that she is useless in any way.  12. Being too serious can turn a girl off.  13. When the guy she likes calls her for the first time, the girl may act uninterested during the call. But as soon as the phone is back on the hook, she will whoop with joy and immediately start telephoning her friends to spread the news.  14. A smile means a lot to a girl.  15. If you like a girl, try making friends with her first. Let her get to know you.  16. If a girl says she can't go out with you because she has to study, leave.  17. But if she still calls you or expect a call from you, stay.  18. Don't try to guess a girl's feelings. Ask her.  19. Hearing the words "I love you" is a great reassurance to a girl that she is beautiful.  20. After a girl falls in love with a guy, she'll wonder why she never noticed him before.  21. If you need tips on how to flirt with a girl, read romance stories.  22. When class pictures come out, a girl would first check who is standing next to her crush before actually looking at herself.  23. A girl's ex-crush will always be in her memory, but the guy she loves now stays in her heart.  24. Girls love having fun!  25. A simple 'Hi' can brighten a girl's day.  26. A girl's best friends usually know best what she is feeling and going through. 27. Girls hate it when a guy pays attention to them just to get close to their 'prettier' friend.  28. Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a girl, in that order.  29. Some girls care about looks, some care about brains, but ALL girls want a guy who will love and care for them.  30. Girls want nothing more than to feel loved.    hmmm...

        You are Form 9,  Vampire : The Undying.   "And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to regrow life from the dead.  But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again."   Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian). The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire. Her sign is the eclipsed moon.  As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.  You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth. You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times.  While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible.  urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

         CREATING PERFECT RELATIONSHIPS?    ---------------------------------  A person visited the government matchmaker for marriage, SDU, and requested, "I am looking for a spouse. Please help me to find a suitable one." The SDU officer said, "Your requirements, please." "Oh, good looking, polite, humorous, sporty, knowledgeable, good in singing and dancing. Willing to accompany me the whole day at home during my leisure hour, if I don't go out. Telling me interesting stories when I need companion for conversation and be silent when I want to rest."  The officer listened carefully and replied, "I understand you need television."   There is a saying that a perfect match can only be found between a blind wife and a deaf husband, because the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband and the deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of the wife.  Many couples are blind and deaf at the courting stage and dream of perpetual perfect relationship. Unfortunately, when the excitement of love wears off, they wake up and discover that marriage is not a bed of roses. The nightmare begins.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   NO POINTING FINGERS   A man asked his father-in-law, "Many people praised you for a successful marriage. Could you please share with me your secret?" The father-in-law answered in a smile, "Never criticise your wife for her shortcomings or when she does something wrong.Always bear in mind that because of her shortcomings and weaknesses, she could not find a better husband than you."   We all look forward to being loved and respected. Many people are afraid of losing face. Generally, when a person makes a mistake,he would look around to find a scapegoat to point the finger at.  This is the start of a war. We should always remember that when we point one finger at a person, the other four fingers are pointing at ourselves. If we forgive others, others will ignore our mistake too.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   NO OVERPOWERING  Many relationships fail because one party tries to overpower another, or demands too much. People in love tend to think that love will conquer all and their spouses will change the bad habits after marriage.  Actually, this is not the case. There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "It is easier to reshape a mountain or a river than a person's character."  It is not easy to change. Thus, having high expectation on changing the spouse character will cause disappointment and unpleasantness. It would be less painful to change ourselves and lower our expectations.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   RIGHT SPEECH  There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "A speech will either prosper or ruin a nation." Many relationships break off because of wrong speech. When a couple is too close with each other, we always forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say anything without considering if it would hurt the other party.   A friend and her millionaire husband visited their construction site. A worker who wore a helmet saw her and shouted, "Hi, Emily! Remember me? We used to date in the secondary school." On the way home, her millionaire husband teased her, "Luckily you married me. Otherwise you will be the wife of a construction worker." She answered, "You should appreciate that you married me. Otherwise, he will be the millionaire and not you."   Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed for a bad relationship.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   TRUST  Trust is a very important factor for all relationships. When trust is broken, it is the end of the relationship. Lack of trust leads to suspicion, suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity may result in separation.    A telephone operator told me that one day she received a phone call. She answered, "Public Utilities Board."  There was silence. She repeated, "PUB." There was still no answer. When she was going to cut off the line, she heard a lady's voice, "Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number from my husband's pocket but I do not know whose number it is."    Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to the couple if the telephone operator answered with just "hello" instead of"PUB".   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   PERSONAL PERCEPTION  Different people have different perception. One man's meat could be another man's poison.    A couple bought a donkey from the market. On the way home, a boy commented, "Very stupid. Why neither of them ride on the donkey?" Upon hearing that, the husband let the wife ride on the donkey. He walked besides them. Later, an old man saw it and commented, "The husband is the head of family. How can the wife ride on the donkey while the husband is on foot?" Hearing this, the wife quickly got down and let the husband ride on the donkey.  Further on the way home, they met an old Lady. She commented, "How can the man ride on the donkey but let the wife walk. He is no gentleman." The husband thus quickly asked the wife to join him on the donkey.  Then, they met a young man. He commented, "Poor donkey, how can you hold up the weight of two persons. They are cruel to you." Hearing that, the husband and wife immediately climbed down from the donkey and carried it on their shoulders. It seems to be the only choice left.  Later, on a narrow bridge, the donkey was frightened and struggled. They lost their balance and fell into the river.    You can never have everyone praise you, nor will everyone condemn you. Never in the past, not at present, and never will be in the future. Thus, do not be too bothered by others words if our conscience is clear.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   BE PATIENT   This is a true story which happened in the States. A man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint of the truck.  The man ran to his son, knocked him away, hammered the little boy's hands into pulp as punishment. When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands.  When the boy woke up from the surgery & saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently said, " Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck." Then he asked, "but when are my fingers going to grow back?" The father went home & committed suicide.   Think about this story the next time someone steps on your feet or u wish to take revenge. Think first before u lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks can be repaired. Broken bones & hurt feelings often can't.  Too often we fail to recognise the difference between the person and the performance. We forget that forgiveness is greater than revenge.  People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever.  Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be patient... Forgive & forget. Love one and all. If you judge people, you have no time to love them   ---------------------------------

        Because She Would Ask Me Why I Loved Her    by Christopher Brennan (1870-1932)    If questioning would make us wise No eyes would ever gaze in eyes; If all our tale were told in speech No mouths would wander each to each.   Were spirits free from mortal mesh And love not bound in hearts of flesh No aching breasts would yearn to meet And find their ecstasy complete.   For who is there that lives and knows The secret powers by which he grows? Were knowledge all, what were our need To thrill and faint and sweetly bleed?   Then seek not, sweet, the "If" and "Why" I love you now until I die. For I must love because I live And life in me is what you give.

       A woman brought a very limp parrot into a Veterinary Clinic.  As she laid her pet on the table, the Vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.  After a moment or two, the Vet shook his head sadly and said, "I'm sorry, but Polly has passed away."  The distressed owner wailed, "Are you sure? I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might be in a coma or something."   The Vet rolled his eyes, shrugged, turned and left the room.  Returning in a few moments with a beautiful black Labrador. As the bird's owner looked on in surprise,  the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the parrot from top to bottom.  He then looked at the Vet with sad eyes and shook his head.   The Vet escorted the dog from the room and returned a few moments later with a cat.  The cat jumped up and delicately sniffed the bird. The cat then sat back, shook it's head, meowed,  and ran out of the room. The Vet looked at the woman and said, "I'm sorry, but, like I said, your parrot is most definitely, 100% certifiably dead."  He then turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill which he handed to the woman.   The parrot's owner, still in shock, took the bill. "A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS!" she cried. "A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS just to tell me my bird is dead?!"  The Vet shrugged. "If you'd taken my word for it, the bill would only have been $20, but... what with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan.....it's $150.00."

       Not My Problem A little mouse living on a farm was looking through a crack in the wall one day and saw the farmer and his wife opening a package. The mouse was intrigued by what food the package may contain. He was aghast to discover that it was a mousetrap. The mouse ran to the farmyard warning everyone "there is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house."  The chicken raised his head and said "Mr. Mouse, I can tell you this trap is a grave concern to you, but it has no consequence to me and I cannot be bothered with it."  The mouse turned to the pig "I am so very sorry Mr. Mouse, but the trap is no concern of mine either!"  The mouse then turned to the bull; "sounds like you have a problem Mr. Mouse, but not one that concerns me."  The mouse returned to the house, head down and dejected that no one would help him or has concerned about his dilemma.  He knew he had to face the trap on his own. That night the sound of a trap catching its prey was heard throughout the house. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness she could not see that it was a venomous snake whose tail the trap had caught.  The snake bit the farmer's wife.  The wife caught a bad fever and the farmer knew the best way to treat a fever was with chicken soup. The farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard to get the soup's main ingredient.  The wife got sicker and friends and neighbors came by to take turns sitting with her round the clock.  The farmer knew he had to feed them, so he butchered the pig.  The farmer wife did not get better, in fact she died and so many friends and family came to her funeral that the farmer had to slaughter the bull to feed all of them.  So the next time we hear that one of our teammates is facing a problem and think it does not concern or affect us, let us remember that when anyone of us is in trouble, we are all at risk.  LIFE IS A CELEBRATION. BE HAPPY & MAKE OTHERS HAPPY.  Admonish your friends privately, but praise them openly.

      reading thru my blog i decide i should copy n paste it here again   They have been married for two years. He loves literature and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography and he handle their wedding photos. He loves her very much. Likewise with her. She has a quick temperand always bullies him. He is a gentleman and always gives in to her.   Today, she's being wilful again.   Her : "Why can't you be the photographer for my friend's wedding? She promised she'd pay."  Him : "I don't have time that day."  Her :"Humph!"  Him : "Huh?"  Her : "Don't have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all the time you need."  Him : "I... someone will definitely recognize my work some day."  Her : "Humph! I don't care, you'll have to do it for her.! "  Him : "No."  Her : "Just this once?"  Him : "No."   Negotiation's broken. So, she gave the final warning: "Give me a Yes within three days, or else..."   First day. She "withheld" the kitchen, bathroom, computer,refrigerator, television, hi-fi... Except the double bed, to show her "benevolence".   Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didn't mind, as he still has some cash in his pockets.   Second day. She conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets and warned, "Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences."   He's nervous now. That night, on the bed, he begs for mercy, hoping that she'll end this state. She doesn't give a damn. No way am I giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees.   Third day. Night. On the Bed. He's lying on the bed, looking to one side. She's lying on the bed, looking to the other side.   Him : "We need to talk."  Her : "Unless it's about the wedding, forget it."  Him : "It's something very important."   She remains silent.   Him :"Let's get a divorce."   She did not believe her ears.   Him : "I got to know a girl."   She's totally angry, and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest. Probably from his undershirt pocket, that's the only place she didn't go through yesterday. How careless.   Him : "She's a nice girl."   Her tears fell.   Him : "She has a good personality too."   She's heartbroken because he puts a photo of some other girl close to his heart.   Him : "She says that she'll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we got married."   She's very jealous because she said the same thing in the past.   Him : "She loves me truly. "   She wishes to sit up and scream at him "Don't I?"   Him : "So, I think she won't force me to do something that I don't want to do."   She's thinking, but the rage won't subside.   Him : "Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?"   Her : ".....!"   He brings the photo before her eyes. She's in a total rage, hits his hand away and leaves a burning slap on his face.   He sighs. She cries.   He puts the photo back to his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket.   He turns off the light, and sleeps. She turns on the light, and sits up. He's asleep. She lost sleep. She regrets treating him the way she treated him.   She cried again, and thought about a lot of things. She wants to wake him up. She wants to have a intimate talk with him. She doesn't want to push him anymore. She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks.   She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry and she wanted to laugh.   It's a nicely taken photo of herself. A photo he took for her. She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek.   He smiled. He was just pretending to be asleep.   "You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."

       Brains  A man has a car wreck and they have to amputate his brain.  So the nurse takes him to the brain transplant wearhouse.  On one side of the shelves are lined with brains marked $500.00 each.  On the other side the shelves are lined with brains marked $200.00 each.  The brainless man asks why the price differece.  The nurse points to the $200.00 brains and explains that these are female brains, so they've been used.  Brains for Sale  A guy walks into a store to buy brains. He asks the woman behind the counter how much each of the brains cost. They  saleswoman tells him, "$5/gram for women's brains, $20/gram for dog's brains, and $100/gram for men's brains."  So the guy is surprised with the varying prices, and he asks the saleswoman, "How come men's brain's are so much more expensive than women's brains or dog's brains?"  And the saleswoman replies, "Are you kidding!?!?!?!? Do you know how many men it takes to get a gram of brains????"   nothing against anyone/anything juz jokes that i had come across dun quite understand the 1st one though heh

       Best Sales man :  A young guy goes to a big department store looking for a job. The manager asks, "Do you have any sales experience?"  The kid, "Yeah, I was a salesman back home". Well, the manager liked the young man, so he gave him the job.  "You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did, but let me give you a bit of advice. If a  customer comes looking, say, for toothpaste, you might suggest for him a toothbrush, or shaving cream etc. You get the idea?"  "Of course,"the young man said.  His first day on the job was rough but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the manager came down. "How many sales did you make today?  The kid says, "One"  The manager groans, "Just one? Our sales people average 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale for?"  The kid says, "$101,237.64."  The manager exclaims, "What? $ 101,237.64? What did you sell him?"  The kid, "First I sold him a small fish hook. Then I sold him a medium fishhook. Then I sold him a larger fishhook. Then I sold him a new fishing rod. Then I asked him where he was going fishing, and he said down at the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department, and I sold him that twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4X4 Pajero."  The manager says "You mean a guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and truck?!"  The kid, "No, no, no, he came in here to buy a box of Kotex for his wife and I said, "Well, since your weekend's already screwed up, you might as well go fishing."

       the past is always influencing the present. we cannot change the past but only to understand it.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  People come into our life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you figure out which one it is, you will know what to do for each  person. When someone is in your life for a REASON. . . It is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with  guidance and support, to aid you physically,emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are! They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled,  their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered. And now it is time to move on! Then people come into your life for a SEASON. Because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season. LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons: things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant. Thank you for being a part of my life. Work, like you don't need the money. Love, like you've never been hurt. And dance, like no one is watching.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you think something will make you happy, Go for it Remember that we pass this way only once. Time Doesn't wait....  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Butter vs. Margarine  DID YOU KNOW? §	Both have the same amount of calories. §	Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams §	Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study §	Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients §	Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added. §	Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods. §	Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less then 100 years. §	Now for Margarine... It is very high in Trans Fatty Acids. Triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease §	Increases total LDL (this is the bad cholesterol). Lowers HDL cholesterol and this is the good one. §	Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold. §	Lowers quality of breast milk. §	Decreases immune response. §	Decreases insulin response. §	And here is the most disturbing fact.... Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE from being PLASTIC! (This fact alone should be enough reason to avoid  margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated. This means hydrogen is added changing the molecular structure of the food) YOU can try this yourself.  Purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or a shaded area.  Within a couple of days you will note a couple of things.  No flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it.  It has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on it, even those teeny weenie microorganisms will not a find a home to grow...Why?  Because it is nearly plastic. Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast?  Ann E.

       ---------------------------------------   A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer. The tech asked her if she was "running it under Windows." The woman then responded, "No, my desk is next to the door. But that is a good point. The man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window, and his is working fine."   ---------------------------------------   Tech Support: "How much free space do you have on your hard drive?" Customer: "Well, my wife likes to get up there on that Internet, and she downloaded ten hours of free space. Is that enough?"   ---------------------------------------   Overheard in a computer shop: Customer: "I'd like a mouse mat, please." Salesperson: "Certainly sir, we've got a large variety." Customer: "But will they be compatible with my computer?"   ---------------------------------------   I once received a fax with a note on the bottom to fax the document back to the sender when I was finished with it, because he needed to keep it.   ---------------------------------------   Customer: "Can you copy the Internet for me on this diskette?"   ---------------------------------------   I work for a local ISP. Frequently we receive phone calls that go something like this: Customer: "Hi. Is this the Internet?"   ---------------------------------------   Some people pay for their on-line services with checks made payable to "The Internet."   ---------------------------------------   Customer: "So that'll get me connected to the Internet, right?"  Tech Support: "Yeah."  Customer: "And that's the latest version of the Internet, right?"  Tech Support: "Uhh...uh...uh...yeah."   ---------------------------------------    Tech Support: "Ok Bob, let's press the control and escape keys at thesame time. That brings up a task list in the middle of the screen.Now type the letter 'P' to bring up the Program Manager."  Customer: "I don't have a 'P'."  Tech Support: "On your keyboard, Bob."  Customer: "What do you mean?"  Tech Support: "'P' on your keyboard, Bob."  Customer: "I'm not going to do that!"    ---------------------------------------   Customer: "My computer crashed!"  Tech Support: "It crashed?"  Customer: "Yeah, it won't let me play my game."  Tech Support: "All right, hit Control-Alt-Delete to reboot."  Customer: "No, it didn't crash-it crashed."  Tech Support: "Huh?"  Customer: "I crashed my game. That's what I said before. Now it doesn't work."  Turned out, the user was playing Lunar Lander and crashed his spaceship.  Tech Support: "Click on 'File, ' then 'New Game.'"  Customer: [pause] "Wow! How'd you learn how to do that?"   ---------------------------------------    There was once a young man who, in his youth, professed his desire to become a great writer.   When asked to define "great" he said, "I want to write stuff that the whole world will read, stuff that people will react to on a truly emotional level, stuff that will make them scream, cry, howl in pain and anger!"   He now works for Microsoft, writing error messages.    ---------------------------------------    Computer science student is studying under a tree and another one pulls up on a flashy new bike The student under the tree asks, "Where'd you get that?!?"   The student on the bike replies, "While I was studying outside, this girl pulls up on her bike... She takes off all her clothes and says to me, 'You can have anything you want'."   The other student responds, "Good choice! -- her clothes probably wouldn't have fit you."    ---------------------------------------   A teacher asked one of her pupils, 'What's the nation's capital?'   The reply was, 'Washington DC'   On being asked what the 'DC' stood for, the pupil added, 'Dot com!'   ---------------------------------------    There are three engineers in a car; an electrical engineer, a chemical engineer and a Microsoft engineer. Suddenly the car just stops by the side of the road, and the three engineers look at each other wondering what could be wrong.   The electrical engineer suggests stripping down the electronics of the car and trying to trace where a fault might have occurred. The chemical engineer, not knowing much about cars, suggests that maybe the fuel is becoming emulsified and getting blocked somewhere.   Then, the Microsoft engineer, not knowing much about anything, comes up with a suggestion, 'Why don't we close all the windows, get out, get back in, open the windows again, and maybe it'll work !?'    ---------------------------------------

       Three men: a philosopher, a mathematician and an idiot, were out riding in the car when it crashed into a tree. Before anyone knew, the three men found themselves standing before the pearly gates of Heaven, where St. Peter and the Devil were standing nearby.  "Gentlemen," the Devil started, "due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, St Peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; If not, then you'll come with me to Hell."  The philosopher then stepped up and said, "OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' teachings". With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil.  The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the philosopher disappeared.  The mathematician then asked, "Give me the most complicated formula you can ever think of!" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too.  The idiot then stepped forward and said, "Bring me a chair!" The Devil brought forward a chair.  "Drill 7 holes on the seat." The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, "Which hole did my fart come out from?"  The Devil inspected the seat and said, "The third hole from the right."  "Wrong," said the idiot, "it's from my asshole."  The idiot went to Heaven.

        If I would Knew    If I knew it would be the last time  that I'd see you fall asleep,  I would tuck you in more tightly  and pray the Lord, your soul to keep.    If I knew it would be the last time  that I see you walk out the door,  I would give you a hug and kiss  and call you back for one more.    If I knew it would be the last time  I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise,  I would video tape each action and word,  so I could play them back day after day.   If I knew it would be the last time,  I could spare an extra minute  to stop and say "I love you,"  instead of assuming you would KNOW I do.    If I knew it would be the last time  I would be there to share your day,  Well I'm sure you'll have so many more,  so I can let just this one slip away.    For surely there's always tomorrow  to make up for an oversight,  and we always get a second chance  to make everything just right.    There will always be another day  to say "I love you,"  And certainly there's another chance  to say our "Anything I can do?"    But just in case I might be wrong,  and today is all I get,  I'd like to say how much I love you  and I hope we never forget.    Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,  young or old alike,  and today may be the last chance  you get to hold your loved one tight.    So if you're waiting for tomorrow,  why not do it today?  For if tomorrow never comes,  you'll surely regret the day,    That you didn't take that extra time  for a smile, a hug, or a kiss  and you were too busy to grant someone,  what turned out to be their one last wish.    So hold your loved ones close today,  and whisper in their ear,  tell them how much you love them  and that you'll always hold them dear    Take time to say "I'm sorry,"  "Please forgive me", "Thank you," or "It's okay."  And if tomorrow never comes,  you'll have no regrets about today.

       TRUE ... mostly quite true... lol    Rules From Men   We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules  from the male side. These are our rules! Please note... these are all  numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!   1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it  down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining  about you leaving it down.   1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.   1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.   1. Crying is blackmail.   1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work!    Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!   1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.   1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do.     Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.   1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.   1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments    become null and void after 7 days.   1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.   1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.   1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry,    we meant the other one.   1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done.    Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.   1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.   1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.   1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit,    not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.   1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.   1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong.    We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.   1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.   1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really.   1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball,     the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.   1. You have enough clothes.   1. You have too many shoes.   1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.   1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know     men really don't mind that, it's like camping.

VARIANT: Needy.B  ALIAS: Java/Needy.B, Trojan/Java/Startpage.D   This variant is functionally close to Needy.A in addition of modifying Internet Explorer search settings as Needy.A does,  it also adds a list of pornographic shortcuts to browser favourite and adds a pornographic shortcut to desktop .     wat the hell!!!

       First flush of love not emotional      14:57 12 November 03     NewScientist.com news service     When you first fall in love, you are not experiencing an emotion, but a motivation or drive, new brain scanning studies have shown.  The early stages of a romantic relationship spark activity in dopamine-rich brain regions associated with motivation and reward. The more intense the relationship is, the greater the activity.  The regions associated with emotion, such as the insular cortex and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex, are not activated until the more mature phases of a relationship, says Helen Fisher, an anthropologist from Rutgers University in New Jersey.  Fisher and colleagues recruited seven male and 10 female volunteers who claimed to be madly in love. They asked them to look at pictures of either their loved one or another familiar person while inside a functional MRI scanner.  Eating chocolate   Early on in a relationship, the images showed that the brain seems to be very focused on planning and pursuit of pleasurable reward, says Fisher, mediated by regions called the right caudate nucleus and right ventral tegmentum. The same regions become active when a person enjoys the pleasure of eating chocolate, she adds.   There are also patterns that resemble aspects of obsessive compulsive disorder. "Activity in one particular area of the anterior cingulate cortex is in common," says Lucy Brown, a neuroscientist from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, who was part of the research team. "The activity is correlated with the length of a relationship, lasting just into the emotional stage."  There are some differences between love-struck men and women, says Fisher. Women in love show more emotional activity earlier on in a relationship. They also seem to quiz their memory regions as they look at pictures of their partner, perhaps paying more attention to their past experience with them.  For men, perhaps unsurprisingly, love looks a little more like lust, with extra activity in visual areas that mediate sexual arousal.   The team has since moved on to examining the final phase of romance. "We are now looking at people who have just been rejected," says Fisher. The research was presented at the Society for Neuroscience's meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday.

       The difference between margarine and butter...   Both have the same amount of calories. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams. Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study.   Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other foods. Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added!   Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less than 100 years.   Now for Margarine...  -Very high in Trans Fatty Acids. Triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease.  -Increases total cholesterol and ! LDL (this is the bad cholesterol)  -Lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol)  -Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold.  -Lowers quality of breast milk.  -Decreases immune response.  -Decreases insulin response.   And here is the most disturbing fact..i.e the most interesting part!!   Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC...This fact alone was enough to have me avoiding margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated (this means hydrogen is added, changing the molecular structure of the substance).   YOU can try this yourself: purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or shaded area. Within a couple of days you will note a couple of things: No flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it (that should tell you something). It does not rot or smell differently, because it has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on it even those teeny weeny microorganisms will! not a find a home to grow.   Why?  Because it is nearly plastic....  Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast??

         You are Form 0, Phoenix: The Eternal. "And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire. He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal." Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun. As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual. You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations. You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from. Phoenixes are the best friends to have because they cheer people up easily.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You are Form 1, Goddess: The Creator. "And The Goddess planted the acorn of life. She cried a single tear and shed a single drop of blood upon the earth where she buried it. From her blood and tear, the acorn grew into the world." Some examples of the Goddess Form are Gaia (Greek), Jehova (Christian), and Brahma (Indian). The Goddess is associated with the concept of creation, the number 1, and the element of earth. Her sign is the dawn sun. As a member of Form 1, you are a charismatic individual and people are drawn to you. Although sometimes you may seem emotionally distant, you are deeply in tune with other people's feelings and have tremendous empathy. Sometimes you have a tendency to neglect your own self. Goddesses are the best friends to have because they're always willing to help.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You are Form 2, Angel: The Pure. "And The Angel rose as holy protector for all that was created. She fought with honor and valor to serve the good of the world. But the coming of the mankind was her downfall; and end to purity." Some examples of the Angel Form are Michael (Christian) and Hercules (Greek). The Angel is associated with the concept of virtue, the number 2, and the element of wind. Her sign is the zenith sun. As a member of Form 2, you are a person of your word. You generally keep your promises and give everything you do your best. Although some people see you as overbearing sometimes, you know that you have to stay true to yourself and do what's right. Angels are the best friends to have because they are brutally honest.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You are Form 3, Unicorn: The Innocent. "And The Unicorn knew she wasn't meant to go into the Dark Wood. Disregarding the advice given to her by the spirits, Unicorn went inside and bled silver blood.. For her misdeed, the world knew evil." Some examples of the Unicorn Form are Eve (Christian) and Pandora (Greek). The Unicorn is associated with the concept of innocence, the number 3, and the element of water. Her sign is the twilight sun. As a member of Form 3, you are a curious individual. You are drawn to new things and become fascinated with ideas you've never come in contact with before. Some people may say you are too nosey, but it's only because you like getting to the bottom of things and solving them. Unicorns are the best friends to have because they are inquisitive.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You are Form 4, Gargoyle: The Fallen.

Demons are the best friends to have because they will back you up.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  You are Form 9, Vampire: The Undying. "And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation. She attempted to regrow life from the dead. But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again." Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian).

       A young girl missed her period for two months. Very worried, the mother goes to the drugstore and buys a pregnancy kit. The test result shows that the girl is pregnant. Shouting, cursing, crying, the mother says,"Who was the pig that did this to you? I want to know!" The girl picks up the phone and makes a call.  Half an hour later a Ferrari stops in front of their house; a mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in a very expensive suit steps out of it and enters the house. He sits in the living room with the father, the mother and the girl, and tells them, "Good morning, your daughter has informed me of the problem. However, I can't marry her because of my personal family situation; but I'll take charge.  If a girl is born, I will bequeath her 2 retail stores, a townhouse, A beach villa and a $1,000,000 bank account. If a boy is born, my legacy will be a couple of factories and a $2,000,000 bank account. If she has a miscarriage, what do you suggest I do?"  At this point, the father, who had remained silent, places a hand on the man's shoulder and tells him, "Then you screw her again!"

       In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the bed firmer to sleep on. That's where the phrase, "goodnight, sleep tight" came from!   The "rule of the thumb" is derived from an old English law that stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider than your thumb.   It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer, and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the "honeymoon."   In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had the consent of the King(unless you were in the Royal Family). When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the King & he gave them a placard that they hung  on their door while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K. (  urlLink Fornication   Under Consent of King) on it. Now you know where that came from.      -~-~-~-~-~-~-    urlLink Fornication   Sexual intercourse between partners who are not married to each other. Word History: The word fornication had a lowly beginning suitable to what has long been the low moral status of the act to which it refers. The Latin word fornix, the ancestor of fornication, is derived, meant “a vault, an arch.” The term also referred to a vaulted cellar or similar place where prostitutes plied their trade. This sense of fornix in Late Latin yielded the verb fornicr, “to commit fornication”, “whoredom, fornication.” Our word is first recorded in Middle English about 1303.  1. Unlawful sexual intercourse on the part of an unmarried person; the act of such illicit sexual intercourse between a man and a woman as does not by law amount to adultery.  Note: In England, the offense, though cognizable in the ecclesiastical courts, was not at common law subject to secular prosecution. In the United States it is indictable in some States at common law, in others only by statute. --Whartyon.  2. (Script.) (a) Adultery. (b) Incest. (c) Idolatry.  voluntary sexual intercourse between persons not married to each other 2: extramarital sex that willfully and maliciously interferes with marriage relations; "adultery is often cited as grounds for divorce"  in every form of it was sternly condemned by the Mosaic law (Lev. 21:9; 19:29; Deut. 22:20, 21, 23-29; 23:18; Ex. 22:16). (See ADULTERY.) But this word is more frequently used in a symbolical than in its ordinary sense. It frequently means a forsaking of God or a following after idols (Isa. 1:2; Jer. 2:20; Ezek. 16; Hos. 1:2; 2:1-5; Jer. 3:8,9).

      read this email    The Hardworking Ant and the Lazy Grasshopper (Thoughts to ponder upon)  Once upon a time,there lived an ant and a grasshopper. The grasshopper does nothing else but jump around and play. On the other hand, the ant is so hardworking, looking for food all day long and store them in it's nest. Looking at his hardworking friend working so hard, the grasshopper ask, "Hey, Ant! U dun have to relax ah? Always busy one. Come and play with me lah." To which the ant replied, "I can't lah i have to store all these food." "Haiyah! Relax lah. Why u bother storing all these food? When u hungry den go find lah." the grasshopper told the ant again. "Eh,cannot lah. I have to standby for the coming winter season.Then I no need to panick mah. I think u oso must standby u know." the ant telling his friend. "Where got time...I go play better. U wanna store food u go ahead lah. I continue playing ok.. bye!" And hop goes the grasshopper. The Ant is a hardworking guy... oops i mean insect.  Not like the grasshopper who is so lazy.  And so as days, weeks, months go by,the winter still has not come yet but the ant is still seen searching and storing food. The two friends happen to meet again. "Hey Ant!  U stil haven't finished storing food ah?  Last time all the food all go where? So fast finish ah?" asked grasshopper. "I got keep but all overdue liao. So cannot eat anymore.  All because winter not here yet. Now i have to go and look for new food." sighed the ant. "But ant ah.. U dun mind i ask ah.. Did u ever have a thought that Singapore where got winter?" ask the grasshopper again. "AHHHH????!!!!!" the ant was shocked!  THE END.  The moral of the story is whatever u do better think properly 1st.  Dun anyhow hantam only... :)  Sometimes we go too busy in life and following our routine too tightly but most importantly, work towards where you wanna go in your life, what is it that you want, what isit that you REALLY want, what's your dream, is what you are doing now moving towards your dream ?  If it's not, dun just keep on working hard n keep on hantam only just because someone in your life told you that this is the way and just because everyone is doing it!! Dun keep on working hard with no direction .......  Focus in the direction of your life not your work but your life.

       urlLink Love Test - Animal Test    1.  You are attracted to those who have split personality, like cold     as ice on the outside, but hot as fire in the heart.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is moods-swing, blow hot and cold in love,     vacillate.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is stylish.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is insecure.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is one which make you feel warmth and in-love always.  6.  You can't resist desire and lust; most probably you'll commit     adultery.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,     you'll treasure it and your partner very much.  8.  At this moment, you are quite self-centered; you think of love as     something you can get and trash anytime you want.

       urlLink Love Test - A Visit to Your SO's Place     1.  The road represents your attitude towards falling in love.      You chose the short road--you fall in love quickly and easily.  2.  The number of red roses represents how much you give in a     relationship, while the number of white represents what you     expect in return.      You give 90% and expect 10% in return.  3.  This question represents your attitude towards handling     relationship problems.      You like to get the person yourself--you are a more direct     person and like to work out problems immediately.  4.  The placement of the roses determines how much you like to see     your boy/girlfriend.      You want to place the roses on the bed--you like to see him/her     a lot.  5.  This represents your attitude towards his/her personality.      You prefer the person to be asleep--you love the person as the     way s/he is.  6.  The road to home tells how long you stay in love with someone.      You chose the short road--you fall out of love easily.

       Between Love and Madness...    A long time ago, before the world was created and humans set foot on it for the first time, virtues and vices floated around and were bored, not knowing what to do.   One day, all the vices and virtues were gathered together and were more bored than ever.   Suddenly, Ingenious came up with an idea: "Let's play hide and seek!"  All of them liked the idea and immediately Madness shouted: "I want to count, I want to count!"   And since nobody was crazy enough to want to seek Madness, all the others agreed.    Madness leaned against a tree and started to count: "One, two, three..."    As Madness counted, the vices and virtues went hiding.  Tenderness hung itself on the horn of the moon,  Treason hid in a pile of garbage.  Fondness curled up between the clouds and Passion went to the centre of the earth.  Lie said that it would hide under a stone, but hid at the bottom of the lake, whilst Avarice entered a sack that he ended up breaking.    And Madness continued to count: "...seventy nine, eighty, eighty one..."    By this time, all the vices and virtues were already hidden - except Love.  For undecided as Love is, he could not decide where to hide. And this should not surprise us, because we all know how difficult it is to hide Love.    Madness: "...ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven..."  Just when Madness got to one hundred, Love jumped into a rose bush where he hid.    And Madness turned around and shouted: "I'm coming, I'm coming!"  As Madness turned around, Laziness was the first to be found, because Laziness had no energy to hide.    Then he spotted Tenderness in the horn of the moon, Lie at the bottom of the lake and Passion at the centre of the earth.    One by one, Madness found them all - except Love.  Madness was getting desperate, unable to find Love.  Envious of Love, Envy whispered to Madness: "You only need to find Love, and Love is hiding in the rose bush."    Madness grabbed a wooden pitch fork and stabbed wildly at the rose bush.  Madness stabbed and stabbed until a heartbreaking cry made him stop.  Love appeared from the rose bush, covering his face with his hands.    Between his fingers ran two trickles of blood from his eyes. Madness, so anxious to find Love, had stabbed out Love's eyes with a pitch fork.    "What have I done! What have I done!" Madness shouted.  "I have left you blind! How can I repair it?"    And Love answered: "You cannot repair my eyes. But if you want to do something for me, you can be my guide."    And so it came about that from that day on, Love is blind and is always accompanied by Madness.

       He met her on a party. She was so outstanding, many guys chasing after her, while he was so normal,nobody paid attention to him.   At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffeewith him, she was surprised, but due to being polite,she promised.   They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything,she felt uncomfortable, she thought,'please, let me go home..'  Suddenly he asked the waiter: "would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee." Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red, but,still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously: why you have this hobby?  He replied: "when I was a little boy, I was living near the sea, I liked playing in the sea, I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who are still living there".  While saying that tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched.  That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his homesickness, he must be a man who loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of home..  Then she also started to speak, spoke about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands; he had tolerance, was kind hearted, warm, careful. He was such a good person but she almost missed him! Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married to the prince, then they were living the happy life... And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked it.  After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter which said:  "My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my whole life lie. This was the only lie I said to you--- the salty coffee.Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead. I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to tell you the truth  many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything..  Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange bad taste.. But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life! Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for the second time, still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again".  Her tears made the letter totally wet.   Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty coffee?  It's sweet. She replied.   Love is not to forget  but to forgive not to see but understand  not to hear  but to listen not to let go but HOLD ON !!!!   Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear...    i din write this shit i read it

        You're Pills: Pills represent you because they're the clean type of hurt.  You dont like the idea of pain, so you take the easy way out. You slowly kill yourself off mind and body without causing outer pain.  This way nobody knows what you're feeling. People hurt you a lot of the times, by the way they act towards you, the things the say.. Sometimes not noticing you.  But you cant help feeling mercy for them. Youd rather sacrifice another piece of yourself for them.  urlLink   what type of hurt are you ?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      - previous comment is down. dunno why. changed to use  urlLink this  liaoz  -  urlLink Pussy Plays with Penis   this is vulgar!    - finally see the  urlLink star !   nothing interesting  - saw this T wif (i think) gloomy bear & wordings: " we bears, will rule the world one day "  COOL!!! =)  -  urlLink Professor Robert Webster, Director of the WHO Collaborating Laboratory on Animal Influenza in Hong Kong, cautioned about the experimental tests, which appeared to detect the H5N1 virus in the nasal cavities of pigs.    old news.. but scary! do keep me update, ppl!   -  urlLink A Girl with an X-ray vision   old news.. but oh wow!!!   - yesterday @ work: astonished to see oni 1 xerox laser printer left for sale, stressed.. found out 2 sold, 2 transferred out, not tat bad.. but no sales for the whole day.. sux.. tiring oso..   - today @ work: not too bad, sold 1 printer to a ang moh customer whose bringing it overseas (think is africa).. but had no mood to work at all for the entire day.. worse thing to hear tat boss had told manager to bring in  250  xerox laser printers into the shop! wtf.. guess i can go byebye to the shop if tat happens.. juz wish i could b back working at best denki... betta working environment n more slacking. hah..   - heard a story from magic wok about the frog n the shoe.. here it goes (roughly):   one day, the frog want to cross the river, he ask the shoe if it can bring him across. the shoe agree. the frog ask the shoe if it is sure that it can bring him across the river. the shoe reassure the frog that it wont be a problem. the shoe bring the frog across the river. halfway, the shoe sink. the frog ask the shoe why it did not say that it couldnt bring him across and did not let him know earlier. the shoe say that it is its nature.   i've got NO clue wat the moral of the story is bout. anyone can tell me?   - in my opinion, seems like sales line is making most money. close to 2k at least. provided selling practical products tat r in demand. (of course, i have yet to get in touch wif a sellable product making money.. soon... i hope soon)   - think i've become a more practical person. for money, seems like anything, almost anything, i'll do for money. i've nv been so desperate. this is insane..

          Good or Bad hard to say…   Once upon a time, there was a king. The king liked one of his followers very much because he was very wise and always gave very useful advice. Therefore the king took him along wherever he went.  One day, a dog bit the king, the finger was injured and the wound was getting worse. He asked the follower if that was a bad sign. The follower said, Good or bad, hard to say'. In the end, the finger of the king was too bad that had to be cut.  The king asked the follower again if that was a bad sign. Again, the follower gave the same answer, 'Good or bad, hard to say'. The king became very angry and sent the follower to prison.  One day, the king went hunting in the jungle. He got excited when he was on the chase of a deer. Deeper and deeper he went inside the jungle. In the end he found himself lost in the jungle. To make thing worse, he got captured by the native people lived inside the jungle.  They wanted to sacrifice him to their god. But when they noticed that the king had one finger short, they released him immediately as he was not a perfect man anymore and not suitable for sacrifice. The king managed to get   back to his palace after all. And he finally understood the follower's wise quote, 'Good or bad, hard to say'. If he hadn't lost one finger, he could   have been killed by the native people. He ordered to release the follower, and apologized to him. But to the king amaze, the follower was not mad at him at all. Instead, the follower said, 'It wasn't a bad thing that you locked me up.'   Why? Because if the king hadn't locked the follower up, he would have brought the follower along to the jungle. If the native found that the king was not suitable, they would have used the follower. Again, the quote 'Good or bad, hard to say' stands.   The moral of the story   Everything that happens in this world, there is no absolute good or bad. Sometimes good things turned out to be bad things eventually, while bad things become a gain.  Whatever good things happen to you, enjoys it, but don't have to hold too tight to it, treat it as a surprise in your life. Whatever bad things happen to you, don't have to feel too sad or despair, in the end, it might not be a total bad thing after all.  If one can understand this, he or she will find life much easier.

It applies to non-Muslims between the ages of 21 and 60 years. The existing HOTA applies only to kidneys and deaths caused by accidents.  6. Who is included under HOTA?

      [title] Sex makes you smart  [date] Today, Tuesday, March 30, 2004  [content] Sex stimulates the brain and makes people more intelligent, according to a top German researcher.  Mr Werner Habermehl, from the Hamburg Medical Research Institute, says that regular sexual intercourse promotes intelligence, reported  Anonova .  He said that lovemaking not only excited the body but also the brain and increased amount of adrenaline and cortisol hormones that are produced stimulates the grey matter, reported magazine  Unicum Campus .  ?Sex makes you more intelligent in that experiences are collected that can be used later on in areas of life not linked to sex,? said Mr Habermehl.  He added that the added injection of endorphins and serotonin that resulted from an orgasm strengthened self-confidence ? giving the body a mental as well as physical work-out.

      A mother and her son were flying Qantas from Perth to Sydney. The son, who had been looking out the window, turned to his mother and said,"Why don't big planes have baby planes?" The mother, who couldn't think of an answer, told her son to ask the flight attendant. So, the little boy asked the flight attendant, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?" The flight attendant asked, "Did your mother tell you to ask me that?" The boy said that she had. With a clever grin, the flight attendant said, "Tell your mother it's because Qantas always pulls out on time."

       1. Gahmen told me last time to stop at 2, so I thought better be kiasu and stop at zero. 2. Sex is cheaper overseas, like in Batam or Hat Yai, so I thought I’d have sex there instead. 3. I’m too scared that I’ll accidentally call out my maid’s name during sex. 4. I am having sex. It’s just that it’s all oral at the moment. 5. Romancing Singapore campaign is too subtle. We need a Let’s Shag, Singapore! Campaign. 6. If I have kids, that means I’ll have to start watching weird shit on TV like Teletubbies or Barney, and I’d rather die. 7. I do’wan to mess up my hair. Do you know how much hairdressing costs nowadays? 8. If I have chewren, wait they take all my Hello Kitty dolls, then how? 9. I can’t do it with my parents in the next room, I don’t have a car, and I can’t afford hotel rooms. 10. Are you kidding? I do’wan to have the same kind of fucked-up children like my parents did. 11. During NS, my sergeant told me to fuck off, so being the obedient type, I’m now completely off fucking. 12. If Ministers want us to have kids, give us some of their salary and maybe I can afford it. 13. Wah lau, I everyday kena screw at work, you want me to go home and screw some more? 14. Which sadist would bring a child into this world to go through our education system? 15. Too scared. During horror movies, the ones who always kena killed first by the psycho serial killer are the ones having sex. 16. During sexuality education in school, they kept teaching us to abstain from sex. I guess I’m just a very good student. 17. I’m just too shacked out from masturbating to Internet porn. 18. How do you know Singaporeans aren’t having enough sex? It’s just being exported. Singapore women only want to have sex with foreigners so they can cabut the country, while Singapore men are having sex in foreign countries like China, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc. 19. I won’t believe the Gahmen seriously wants me to have sex until MediaCorp starts producing porn. (Note: please, not starring Moses Lim or Lydia Sum.) 20. Every time I have sex, I recall that the Gahmen wants me to have sex, and frankly, thinking of the Gahmen when having sex totally kills my mood.

        Guys drink to forget about the girl...     Girls drink to think back about the guy...      When guys are in love, they become poor.     When girls are in love, they become pretty...      Guys can forget, but cannot forgive...     Girls can forgive, but cannot forget..      Guys care the most about the quantity of love...     Girls care the most about the quality of love..      Guys break-up when they feel love from another Girl...     Girls break-up when they feel the feeling of Separation from her man...      Guys feel curiosity towards all girls...     Girls feel curiosity towards guys who are Interested in her..      When guys are heartbroken, they try to forget About the girl by going out with another girl...

      "cite" this meaningful story from namida's webbie   There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His Father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence. The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails ! into the fence. Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. " A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one. Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear, they share words of praise and they always want to open their hearts to us."

      1. Tests have shown that women rate 3% higher in general intelligence than men although their brain size is smaller. Most women act dumb to make their mates look good.  2. Women are walking radar detectors, that is why men have difficulty lying to women. Their brains have the ability to integrate and decipher verbal, visual and other signals of body language.  3. Women want lots of sex with the man she loves. Men just want lots of sex.  4. When men flirt, they will lower their pitch of voice. Women will raise theirs.  5. Women talk and think aloud while men do them silently. As a result, men think women talk too much and are nags.  6. Women talk about their problems as a way of relieving stress. She wants to be heard, not fixed by being offered advice and solutions.  7. Speech and words are not a specific brain skill for men. They find it hard to express themselves. That's why they often choose greeting cards with plenty of words inside. That way, there's less space for them to write.  8. Women leave men, not because they are unhappy with what he can provide, but because they are emotionally unfulfilled.  9. Women ! uses an average of 20,000 communication words, sounds, and gestures a day. Men only use about 7,000.  10. So if a woman is talking to you a lot, she likes you. But if she's not talking, you're in trouble.  11. Men are more thick-skined than women. Literally. Which explains why women have more wrinkles than men. Boys lose their sensitivity to touch by the time they reach puberty. So where does all that sensitivity go?  It all goes to just one area.  12. If a woman is unhappy in her relationship, she can't concentrate on her work.  If a man is unhappy at work, he can't focus on his relationship.  13. Men can only do one thing at a time. When they stop their car to read a street directory, they have to turn down the radio.  Women's brains are configured for multi-tasking performance. They can talk on the phone, watch the TV and cook at the same time.  14. Most men get a brain hemorrhage after 20 minutes of clothes shopping.  15. When it comes to sex, women need a reason; men need a place.  16. 15% to 20% of men have feminised brains. About 10% of women have masculinised brains. So there are more gays than lesbians in the world.

        A long time ago, there was an Emperor who told his horseman that if he could ride on his horse and cover as much land area as he likes, then the Emperor would give him the area of land he has covered. Sure enough, the horseman quickly jumped onto his horse and rode as fast as possible to cover as much land area as he could.  He kept on riding and riding, whipping the horse to go as fast as possible.  When he was hungry or tired, he did not stop because he wanted to cover as much area as possible. It came to a point when he had covered a substantial area and he was exhausted and was dying.  Then he asked himself, "Why did I pushed myself so hard to cover so much land area? Now I am dying and I only need a very small area to bury myself." The above story is similar with the journey of our Life.  We push very hard everyday to make more money, to gain more power and more recognition. We neglect our health, time with our family and to appreciate the surrounding beauty and the hobbies we enjoy. One day when we look back, we will realize that we don't really need that much, but then we cannot turn back time for what we have missed. Life is not just about making money, acquiring power or recognition. Life is definitely not about work! Work is only necessary to earn a living so that we can enjoy the convenience and pleasures of life. Life is a balance of Work and Play, Family and Personal time. You have to decide how you want to balance your Life. Define your priorities, realize what you are able to compromise but always let some of your decisions be based on your instincts. Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of Life, the whole aim of human existence. So, take it easy, do what you want to do and appreciate nature. Life is fragile, Life is short. Do not take Life for granted. Live a balanced lifestyle. Enjoy Life! Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habits. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny

Dracula asked God, "May I be reincarnated as a white angel with wings and  still suck blood?"  God said, "Okay" and Poof! Dracula turned into a sanitary pad".   Why was two-piece bikinis invented?  To separate the meat section from the dairy section.   Mother was scolding the daughter, " I don't like the guy you are going out  with. He is too dumb".  "No, momma," she said, "He is going to be a doctor & he has already cured  me of that illness that I used to have every month!"

Scary!! =>    urlLink Worm cuts off antivirus programs    A new worm can shut down antivirus applications, according to security firm F-Secure   A new worm variant that can terminate antivirus applications was discovered last Friday, prompting Internet security vendor F-Secure to issue a level two warning.  The variant, called Zafi.B, is spread through email attachments in PIF., EXE. or Com attachments, and according to F-Secure, the worm "terminates all applications that have 'firewall' or 'virus' in their file-name".  The worm is capable of transmitting in several languages, including English, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Swedish, German or Finnish, said F-Secure, and spreads itself by collecting email addresses from the recipient's address book.  Zafi.B copies itself to the Windows System Directory when activated, and replicates itself as either "winamp 7.0 full_install.exe" or "Total Commander 7.0 full_install.exe" files in folders that contain "share" or "upload" in their names, according to F-Secure.  Manager for F-Secure, Mikael Albrecht, says the worm is particularly complicated as it has the capacity to penetrate firewalls and antivirus applications in order to "help itself spread further".  "Another interesting thing about this worm is that the infected messages come in many different languages. As most of the widely spread worms use only English, this feature may confuse the user to open the message - and the worm spreads on", he said.  However, Internet security firm Symantec has listed the virus as having an "easy" threat-containment rating and a "low" geographical distribution area.  A Symantec spokesman maintained that the worm is still "nothing significant".  "The worm tries to disable the security processes on the machine to make it more vulnerable to other attacks," said the spokesman.  He said that users who notice unusual messages regarding system vulnerability may be infected and should scan their computers to guard against further infection.   NO Comments.. juz scary!

      gone to the new jurong library yesterday it's see-through.. kinda sucky design of the whole building i hate the concept; would prefer woodlands library the see-through effect only allows library users to look out to the road and some of the surroundings... nothing impressive or soothing.. kids passingby outside can disturb the users' peace by knocking or banging on the glass... the library is big n spacious n i aint famaliar wif the place.  after the less-than-an-hour futile library trip, went to jp to fetch dear home  slacking at home for the pass few days after the pc show  missed the hitler n stalin biography on monday nite though :(  pc show at expo from 3rd till 6th june it was real packed n bz there seems much more sales than the it fair though my company sales was not so good compared to then  on 2nd day after rdshow, i had the worst scariest experience ever in my life in the clementi mrt toilet!  betta not too much details images of tat day still run thru my head once a while!

      Once upon a time, there was a teacher and his student lying down under a big tree near a big grass area. Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher,  Student : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Can you please help me?  Teacher : (Silent for few second, than he answer) Well, it's a pretty hard and easy question.  Student : (Thinking hard) Huh???  Teacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.  Student : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).  A few minutes later...  Student : I'm back.  Teacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand.  Student : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Cause you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back.  Teacher : That's what happened in real life.  What is the message of this story?  * Grass - is people around you * Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you * Grass Field - is time  * In looking for your soulmate, please don't always compare and hope that there will be a better one. By doing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember "Time Never Goes Back".   It applies the same in finding your ideal life partner, your suitable career or business, therefore the morale is LOVE & grab hold of the opportunity that you have now, don't waste time!   ** There Can Be Only One **

       This is a forwarded message Subject: softdrinks  ===8  For those of you who likes soft drinks, think twice !  drink beer  Please read this. An interesting piece of information.......  Have a look at the wrapper on a *oca-*ola 1.5 liter bottle and in the ingredients label you will find phosphoric acid in it. Minute quantities of ethylene glycol are also used (which is acknowledged in the soft drink world for making it really chill).  This is popularly known as anti-freeze which prevents water from freezing at 0 deg C and instead drops it 4-5 degrees with minute quantities. This chemical is a known slow poison in the caliber of arsenic.  So, if you manage to drink about 4 liters of *oke within an hour or so, you  can  die.  Read along and give up these dangerous things. Be natural; have  flavored milks, tender coconuts, buttermilk, lassi and plain  water instead of these "soft" drinks. Guess what's the pH for soft  drinks, e.g. *oke? pH 3.4! This acidity is strong enough to dissolve teeth and bones!  Our human body stops building bones at the age of about 30. Soft drinks do have any nutrition value (in terms of vitamins & minerals).  It is high in sugar content, carbonic acid, chemicals i.e. colorings etc.  Some like to take cold soft drinks after each meal. Guess what's the impact? Our body  needs an optimum temperature of 37 degrees Celsius for digestive enzyme functioning. The temperature of cold soft drinks is very much below 37 degrees or even close to 0 degrees Celsius. This will dilute the enzymes & stress the digestive system. The food taken will not be digested. In fact it will be fermented!  The fermented food produces gases, decays and becomes toxin, gets absorbed by the intestine, circulates in the blood stream and is carried to the whole body. Hence toxin is cumulated in other parts of the body, developing into various diseases.  Think before you drink *oke/*epsi (or any soft drink) again. Have you ever thought what you drink when you drink an aerated drink?  You gulp down carbon dioxide, when nobody in the world would advise you to drink CO2. Two months back, there was a competition at Delhi University "Who could drink the most *oke?" The winner drank 8 bottles and fainted on the spot-too much CO2 in the blood. Thereafter, the principal banned all soft drinks from the college canteen!  While this might have been an extreme measure, their results do provide some food for  thought. Did you know that soft drinks use chemicals in them that cause immense harm to you. Someone put a broken tooth in a bottle of  *epsi and in 10 days it DISSOLVED! Can you believe it? Teeth and bones are the only human parts that stay intact for years after death. Imagine what the drink must be doing to your soft intestines and stomach lining!   ===8
