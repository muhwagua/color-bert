      well nice move with that tripping keiko. today some mother fucking asshole stole my money and if i ever find out who it was i will kill her. at play practice we were in like the same scene for an hour and its one where i am onstage but just sitting on a chair in the corner and i had to stay in character but i didnt say anything. so boring. i just kind of talked to myself and acted "drunk" because my character is a drunk. today was that carnation day and i think i was laughing for like 10 minutes about ben's flower. but ill write more on that in static prevails. my own personal blog. well stay tuned for more updates from the rest of the crew. not including tray or jean because tray never goes online because she is too busy running around the world and jean is just too busy in general. well. that's it.

      wow this is nuts...now all my thoughts are for the world to see.  i have an hour before dance so i'm just sitting around and am probably going to beth's in a little bit.  Today I had peer counseling and it fun was cause everyone was sharing drunk stories (some people are nuts).  I hate the fact that I don't trust anyone in it though.  I got some of the stupidest comments about my FBI shirt today but I think the dumbest came was federal boob inspector.  keiko's embarressing moment of the day: i was coming down the hall and I tripped on something (damn that something) and i hit my head on the glass part of the door.  Luckily this was after school, but feel free to laugh at me now.

      Courtney got a purse!!!?!?!! this is an epiphany! i can't wait to see it. god reading this makes me feel like such a fat ass. i ate like 7 oreos at play practice and then came home and had 3 big chocolate chip cookies that i made yesterday and forgot to bring to school. let's just be honest with ourselves here. Courtney is never going to get the bigger guitar. she;s going to be stuck with baby forever. or at least until she buys eric. i have a new part time job! its tutoring my brother! i get $10 a day! ohh yes ohh yes. i know you're all jealous because i get $10 for an hour to an hour and a half max. well i guess thats life. or something like it. bahhh dum chhh. today sucked and i'm such a little weirdo. and an obvious one at that- when it comes to liking guys. Keiko you know what i mean you silly girl. but the good news is IM STAYING IN ACCELERATED CHEMISTRY!!! despite the D i did get on the final that keiko insisted was not going to happen, i managed to pull off a B for the semester, a B-, but a b none the less.

      i watched donnie darko today after finals and i'm still thinking about frank and his crazy antics.  court how ya been? seems like i haven't seen you in forever.  planning to go to dance tonight cause i haven't gone in like 4 days which is really long for me. so i'm almost positive that i'm not going to ask anyone to turnabout because unlike audrey, i'm not brave enough to ask and there is no one to ask. So instead liz and i are probably going to do something, which i would like to believe will be more fun than the dance.  guy suck

      Well the only reason I signed up to be in this group blog is because... I was kind of skimming through it and I saw what Court said... It was something like I hate my brotehr I'll see you in hell John... and well that just cracks me up uncontrollably... hah Court member when we made the list of things we hate in school and for Mrs. Grant it said I'll see you in hell women.,... good times... Oh wait member when we made the Pros and Cons list lol ... shhhhhh don't tell the boys we did it on haha ... well that's all for now... actually one more thing... Dave Matthews Band concert tickets go on sale soon but I'm not sure when so if anyone knows could they let me know!  I have 13 dollars saved i think I'll make it to 58 by the end of feb lol oh well... Dave kicks ass... Cya

      So since I'm at home, while all of you are at school (muahahaha), I'll tell you about the different symptoms I've been experiences for the past three days......migraines, dizziness, sore throat, fever, stuffy nose, cough, nausea, constant tearing (don't know what that one's all about), chills followed by extreme sweating, and my favorite--looking at people and thinking that they're moving really fast and being really loud...it's kinda hard to explain.  So anyway my mom's threatening to take me to see my doctor, who I'm soon changing, who is this crazy indian lady (no offense) that looks like a man and is very rough and has cold hands.  it's not a fun experience.  So this weekend I watched Dune, Flower Drum Song, the Signs, and a bunch of home movies. Dune is the weirdest movie i've ever seen, there are little girls with glowing blue eyes, fat guys that have plugs in their stomach who float, huge worm things that people ride, etc.  Audrey thanks for calling me and dropping stuff off for me, you're an awesome friend.

(not really i just kind of looked at it) and american eagle is so boring i have a 15$ GC there and i dont really like anything there. then we went to lake geneva and some other really boring wisconsin towns. my dad went into alot of antique shops. you know. the usual. but i did get a double dare shirt from this junk store so i guess it kinda made the day.

      here in washington dc sitting in my bro's apartment about to go to bed.  tomorrow morning i'll probably go see the holocaust museum, so that'll probably be pretty intense.  i'm so glad to be out of schaumburg!!!!!!!! it's really refreshing to be in a completely new place.  I agree with you court, let's move to california.  audrey, if i get the chance i might give you a call sometime during the week, but i'm sure you'll be busy hanging out with carter and the gang.  sorry i couldn't hang out with today before i left but i woke up at 2 so i really didn't have much sitting around time after i was done packing.  spring break wooohoo!

      well i decided to write for someone very special to me- this one's for you Sarah! Today was pretty shitty but to the fault of nobody inparticular.  my relay for life team is getting shittier and shittier because no one is able to join my team for one reason or another...so if you're reading this and you're not already on audrey's team (of course these people don't exist) then feel free to join hi my name is dan.  I'll throw in a little happy dance just for kicks.  Sorry i missed the last episode of Dawson's Creek, but I was do busy being "wind" for dance...all of you who are coming will have the pleasure of saying "what the fuck?????" when you actually see the dance.  You'll also be able to watch me act like the mother from Mary Poppins and be a chimney sweep, oh the fun you'll have if i let anyone come.  I also learned today that there is no such thing as the perfect relationship.  It's not your fault Steve if you're reading this.  It was just kind of a let down because all the relationships that I thought would last forever are slowly dying off.  I find that extremely sad and disheartening but what can you do really?  I hope I find someone someday that I will want to see everyday for the rest of my life and vice versa, or maybe I already have.  The main thing I've found out is that every high school relationship is essentially exactly the same, no matter the situation.  One last thing before I sleep and finishing making the DAMN hats (or to quote Audrey "i'll see you in hell!!!!"), I just want to thank Audrey for the most meaningful letter I've ever received.  I'm so glad I found it between my car seats haha.  I am definitely the luckiest person alive to have you as someone who cares about me and always will.  I love you.

Emma's staying at my house this weekend, but she's at work right now.  We are having fun and all my blog friends (lol gay ass) said she was cool, so that was pretty cool.  I watched Justin's band practice yesterday. He is so good, and I am so jealous.  Oh well, at least I'm good at...um...oh yeah that's right, I'm not good at anything.

      so today that friend of bernadettes who looks like avril yelled at me when i was going to lunch with keiko. i said "MAN CHECK OUT MY HAIR TODAY! I AM A PUNK ROCK!!!!!!" and she exclaimed "WHAT?!" in a tone that i could only understand to mean "you;'re not punk rock you stupid bitch. Only me ONLY ME! me and my avril! only me and my hot topic! only me and all this material that means so much to me! only me!"  so naturally i walked away and laughed at how pathetic the world is.

      I always think to myself "hey audrey, how come its so easy to get over you? and yet so difficult for you to move on?" and then i think. i usually conclude something like I'm lonely and awkward and desperate for love!!! haha oh chandler. okay so im not feeling so great right now. i kind of hate life. ive been thinking... what if you find your lobster, but youre not his lobster? what then? i just can't stop thinking about it lately. and right now im in the mood to list every single memory. starting with eating your sandwhich in 7th grade. but i'm not going to. it would be pathetic how much i remember. BUT i just remembered that tonight i heard faith hill- just breath at the chiropractor and i thought of this one time in his house when we were listening to his moms faith hill cd for no reason at all. lol. but it was funny. oh man and then the time............ no. stop there audrey.

      so i finally exposed my green monster today for no real reason.  i know i'm wrong and have nothing to worry about, but i can't help it.  and for some reason i just don't feel like sleeping tonight, so i'll probably just end up scaring the shit out of me reading amityville horror and listening to fischerspooner.  who's up for an ap euro packet bonfire at the end of the year??????

      cast the pearls aside, of a simple life of need come into my life forever the crumbled cities stand as known of the sights you have been shown of the hurt you call your own LOVE IS SUICIDE  the empty bodies stand at rest casualties of their own flesh afflicted by their dispossession but no bodies ever knew no bodies felt like you LOVE IS SUICIDE  now we drive the night, to the ironies of peace you can't help deny forever the tragedies reside in you the secret sights hide in you the lonely nights divide you in two all my blisters now revealed in the darkness of my dreams in the spaces in between us no bodies felt like you LOVE IS SUICIDE

      So I am finally in the blog.  I feel honored.  So I'm blogging right now to avoid the homwork that is hanging over my head right now.  I haven't really been able to do homework/sleep for the past week and a half.  It sucks a lot of ass. But on a happier note, the new Deftones album comes out tomorrow.  Hopefully there will be a lot of screaming on this album because I have been very angry lately.  I watched the season finale of Everwood tonight and cried a lot.  It was good.  Tomorrow is the series finale of Buffy.  I'm even more of a TV nerd now that I am single.  Today I came to the realization that everyone is breaking up.  I was really the one that started this depressing trend, so good job Sarah!  Speaking of getting broken up with recently, the timing could not have been worse.  Perhaps this was the thought process: "Hmmmm...Sarah is just getting off the antidepressants she's been on for two years, I know!  I will break up with her today!  Brilliant!"  This sucks.  I totally need to move on from this breakup from hell.  Oh well, looks like another sleepless night for me. Peace.

      so today was fun eventhough i got jack-shit (hyphen necessary?) done on my incredible gifted project.  oh man will it suck beyond compare, maybe if i act really white and make it seem like i knew nothing about origami before this, more people will be impressed.  i'll just say that the girl who make all the cranes was name ching-chong, that'll go over big. trying on dresses was fun tonight, but i think i should just give all of them to audrey cause she looked so damn hot...to be quite honest i wanted her.  then steve made us all feel like we were pretty, he's so good at that.  hopefully next weekend the gang will go downtown and actually do something cool without getting shot.  oh man i can definitely see steve pissing off some huge homeless guys with rabies and getting us all killed.  maybe i'll bring my mace cans...........yes

      so the best way to patch things up right now is to bring in the 4th party.  no, my mistake, the 5th.  double A B C and R.  bring in the 5th party and fuck her. the quickest relief as of now.  go out and fuck.  or order in.  whichever.

      its total ass shit.  just seeing you makes me want to blow your head right the fuck off.  you have an erection.  you are rubbing it.  your shirt reads FAG in bold capitilaized letters.  ive got a sharp 10 foot pole stuck neatly through your cranium.  you still show off your sharp teeth like your jaw is something to be proud of. like your arms are something to be proud of. like your hair is something to be proud of.  like your fucking face is something to be proud of.  when ive let it out, your face will be something that  I'm  proud of.   krista hears the only organ between all humans made for sexual pleasure when i speak his name.  apparently i leave out number 14.

      walking down a serene and quiet street i see the headlights of a truck. completely incoherent, i had no grasp of the monumental event about to take place. as i watch you walk out into the street my subtle and subconscious confusion turns to a mild fear in the back of my mind. with a dazed and contented look i watch your death instantly upon impact.without much thought, i instinctively pick up the pieces of your fragmented body. amidst the bloody mess of apendages, i find your once beating heart. it was black and hollow, and i was not surprised. the mess you made will stain that street for ever and the blood that covered me will never completely wash off.

      caressed by the inside ive a flower in my belly.....no rather a feather......no rather the disemboweled goose it tickles my inanimacy with a paper weight and a corkscrew.  if i dig 6 more feet id be farther along than my own cortex can stir.  i lept into a vortex and watched the mitosis of the dark stars against the indigo background.  they have an eye in the middle that sees only impurity.....and deletes it.  i became a part of a moon with a face on it.  it was your face, now that i think about it.  can i call it think? i found a hallucinogen that thinks for me.  a narcotic moves me.  amphetamines keep me in a crate.  found a crowbar.  prying is going to be the job of the days of the future before the mammals are asked to parade back into the restless seas to destroy the virus.  i call it a slug. you call it human.  it was has 5 arms. one holds a coat hanger, the next a dildo, the next the severed head of a gazelle, the next a peace sign, and the last a timer.  the timer counts down the amount of time before the universe collapses back on itself.  it makes me wonder if thats what will happen to the necroverse.  perhaps all interuniversal entities will spend a few billion years feeding in the trenches?  they will grow larger with the extra space of the realms.  i wish i had the momentum i had before.  i wish i had yours.  i wish i had you. if its any consolation, you can stay beneath my abdominal slit for as long as it takes you to grow a second head.  youll love it in there.  ive a better view of the stars inside than any place in this realm. So now you hate me.

      Blow the last candle out. let the wax harden  I wish I could stop crying. I wish someone still loved me  Just breathe and focus. how can I when the air is so cold and empty  That my lungs froze right in my chest  I'll be honest the silver linings are getting harder and harder to manufacture  And the smiles are so difficult to fake  What do I have to do, or who do I have to kill, to get what I want. what I need  Happiness is an emotion I was born to this world without, nothing pleases me. I cannot be satiated  Thru this toil I will breed my own distress and destroy my best hopes, fuck up the only things I love.  I WATCHED MY DREAMS DIE.  I watched my aspirations crash to the ground on the backs of the angels that I've slain.  But I meant so well, I tried to hard, gave every ounce of my soul, to what end.  Desolation, desire, exhale, pass away.

       Besides, being a fat hot dog eating white slob sitting in front of the tube all day watching baseball is beter then being some communist weiner that cant tell ur ass from your head.....making you some indistinguishable ass-head clone.  Communism and democracy both blow, but its like trail mix, and trail mix with generic M&M's.  They both blow, but at least democracy has generic M&M's.

      Fuck off like you're the only person that has ever cried or been broken by love  Spare me your pity party drunk off your own misfortunes  Wallowing in your blissful melancholy  .can you taste my blood. You knew that this would kill me. But you carried on and on  with your selfish shit., everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you  instead your greed compelled you to steal other silver linings...  burnt down my world, you killed my hope  spread out the ash and walked away  how could you just close off your eyes... turn tail and run, you are the greatest coward  damn right I am still pissed.. next time I see you we will see who has the upper hand

      I just got back from my guidance counselor, which i was approaching to sign up for summer school. health and consumer ed.  well, turns out both of em are filled for the first half of the summer school duration. so i gotta choose one or the other.  BUT when i choose one, my counselor will check the other one at other schools......so maybe i'll get to take it at schaumburg and then one of you will be in my class.  knowing my luck that wont happen. but hell, i can hope, right?

      Gifted Expo=Night of Utter Hell.  All you freshman run away as fast as you can.  Except for the fact that I raised some money for Greg, the night was a complete waste.  Riding back from picking Audrey's guitar was fun though, even though I couldn't laugh normally cause of my damn cold.  It was mainly just a wide opening of the mouth with an attempted sound.  Why do you have to be so cute?   We're talking away I don't know what I'm to say  I'll say it anyway Today's another day to find you  Shying away I'll be coming for your love, OK?  Take on me, take me on I'll be gone In a day or two  So needless to say I'm odds and ends But that's me  stumbling away Slowly learning that life is OK.  Say after me It's no better to be safe than sorry  That's right....A-ha lyrics from the 80's, I am the coolest person alive!

      okay i think i figured out the problem weve been having with the blog is that one post carter had with all those XXXXXXs. it kind of fucked up the blogs memory or something so it didnt know what to do. so this is a temporary soluytion and after a week carters post wont be up on the main page so we should be able to go back to a somewhat normal template. sorry for the problems. im working on it presently.  love, your webmasterblogger audrey a big loser

      titanium like a turle i have a shell like a daddy long legs i have one limb.  im just so strong. ive got no faults right?  ive got no feelings.  ive got no compassion.  maybe i just never filled you in.  maybe i just never told you why that metal was molded.  like i give a shit.  when i lost feeling way back then, it shows through every once in a while.  its rare.  because of its scarcity its always taken as a lead, like a joke like i dont care like i fucked someone over.  im sick of being blamed for it.  try sitting alone.  try getting hit in the face.  try crying because youre afraid.  try crying because youre pathetic.  try living by hiding your own insecurities than making fun of them yourself.  try bottling it up.  and i know im just gonna hear of it all. every last one done before me on the checklist.  i dont care.  i already heard it.   but thats not the question right now.  the question is have you? theres no way to put my feelings down.  theres no way to clearly understand.  why do i care anymore?  why do i try?

      driving home in the dark is probably the most lonely throught provoking experience anyone can have. i think if theres one thing im good at its putting myself in a position for rejection, even when theres nothing to rejected from. i'm just that good.   when it comes down to it, there are too many things. what i want no longer matters. it never did. i feel lost again and i don't know what i should be doing to make myself feel more 'found' maybe ill try fucking around. if thats what it takes. idont understand you or what you want at all. jealousy shouldnt not exist in our platonic relationship. but it does. so what does that say? what do you want? im tired of talking in these circles that get us no where. these long silences are nothing but time for me to reflect on how wrong i went again. don't fuck around. maybe you shouldn't. maybe the next time i see you ill bring a small knife and carve my way into your heart, each cut that goes deeper would represent every time ive felt fucked over and completely overlooked in the last 4 months. every vein struck would give more reason to dig further still. and when i am finished ill give you a mirror and show you what ive done, so you can see what i feel like only bloodier with make-shift stitching in attempts to heal reopened wounds. what i want is something ill never have. i had learned to accept it up until tonight. but now that i feel dead inside i understand that no matter what i do, no one will ever want the same thing as me. maybe ill only be understood once im dead. maybe then we will want the same thing. maybe ill go fuck around right now. maybe ill drown myself in a baby pool filled with terms of endearment that were really just lies.

      I'll give you countless amounts of outright acceptance if you want it.  I will give you encouragment to choose the path you want if you need it. You can speak of anger and doubts, your fears and freak-outs and I'll hold it. You can share your so-called "shamefilled" accounts of times in your life and I  won't judge it. And  there are no strings attached to it.

      I never seem to care at the fork in the road but regret always knows which way i turned and its legs are much longer than mine.  it was TAB.  now TAABCR.  i made BEAD. theres no one to Go Hang out with right now.  i'm afraid to call her because i don't know what i'll say.  she is not home. she wants nothing to do with me.  she cannot admit her feelings.  she can not come over because i am not alone.  what makes you think that its all the same girl?

      Don't say that she's pretty And did you say that she loved you Baby I don't want to know  So I begin not to love you Turn 'round, see me running I say I loved you years ago But tell myself you never loved me no  And don't say that she's pretty And did you say that she loved you Baby I don't want to know  Oh no And can you tell me was it worth it Baby I don't want to know  I follow you down 'till the sound  Of my voice will haunt you Give me just a chance You'll never get away from the sound Of the woman who loves you Was I just a fool?

      Self centered and wanting to be told it was all her.  Well maybe what you thought was different.  Maybe you switched the lines somewhere. Maybe you dont understand right.  That maybe I was mad.  That maybe the contrast was meant to kill her.  Instead of a cripple,  you are now so far away.  Do you understand yet?  She doesn't want to hear it.

      dyed carter's hair tonight. it looks pretty fucking cool if i do say so myself. i got dye on RBF though and at one point carter wanted me to take off one of my latex gloves so he could do it. i thought it was funny. and then he got blue dye on his ears. and that was funnier. i ended up staying till 10. that makes me feel rreally cool because everyone else has to leave at 9 but i get like this half an hour extention and tonight it was longer than that. i love every schultz in thathouse. they are definitely my favorite family.

      The day couldnt have taken a more unexpected turn for the better.  4th block was looking like a boring hour and a half. nothing but sitting and listening to cD's.  who else walks in the door but Chermie.  i remember her saying she would stop by......to turn something in?  i dont remember. point is, somehow i end up leaving with steve and brian and chermie.  we go out to her car and we just leave. it was so cool.  and then we drove. we took steve to mary's.  we took brian home. me and chermie.......we took a drive. picked up a schaumburg senior friend of hers, brandon.  got a ciling fan from the lawn of a house we saw. went by cebo's to put it in his lawn....decided it wouldnt work out. decided to leave it at audreys....however there were lots of mexicans standing on her house so that didnt happen.  ended up putting it in victoria park after going to many other peopls houses to try to put it on their lawns.  none worked.  however.........just such a fucking awesome day.

The rise of the western civilization has impacted our society to the greater advantage.  We need change because we are stronger  and we need the power to fufill the duties of all the surronding civilizations and their advancements. The rise of the eastern civilization influenced the northern.  Thanks to tray for that last line. hahahahhahah so funnnny.

      There are four more days of school left.  I can't take it anymore.  I can't take seeing them together.  I'm not creative enough like Carter to come up with some creative literary devices, so I will be a little more candor about my feelings.  Today I got a 97% on my chemistry test.  You can imagine my excitement, because I have successfully brought my grade up from the C at the beginning of the quarter to an A-.  It was really a natural high.  Unfortunately, I leave my chemistry class and turn to the right.  What?  What's that, they're together again?  Typical.  My day has just been broght down to par once again.  But I guess par is better than the days I've usually been having this month.  Every time I even look at Matt I can literally feel sharp pain in my heart.  I don't know if I will ever recover from this.

      at one point being young and confused with new hormones i took the small razor i kept in the santa marker and held it to my wrist for 3 hours.  having developed pubic hair and pride, i now hold that razor to everyone else's wrist.  there are 2 kinds of fucked up people in the world.  the sad ones, who kill themselves, and the mad ones, who kill everyone else.  once you know a fucked up person, it is easy to put them into the correct category.  youll see.  some of them are stupid.  those ones are usually sad.  some of them are suckers.  those are the sad ones.  occasionally you get the intelligent one that is sad.  those who have no confidence.  the ones with confidence are mad. line the bathtub with silk for it is my coffin. line the hallways with blood for it is their crypt. you fucking suckers.  you FUCKING suckers. one sucker.  you sucker. you absolute sucker.

      sixth grade romance sparked in my heart and hasnt let go of me since. like jack and rose we held on through celine dion as the lights above the roller rink shown down on us. i remember like yesterday, i saw my future and soul in his eyes. a year later the feeling was no longer mutual, and in spanish, i dreamed of my Raul someday feeling the way he had in the past. i longed to be in discovery so i could be by his side through our junior high years of turbulance. i poured my heart to him only to be crushed. so like any 12 year old, i moved on, but the wounds stayed and will forever stay until we can be together. seeing him in the halls and driving past his house is like pouring salt into my deep grief-stricken laceration. forever you will stay in the caverns of my untamed heart.

      My, my what a mess we've made of our pretty little heads these days. It appears a heavy wind's blown through here recently. Best wishes have been made for you, you never had no say it's true. You have to be the cutest gravedigger I've ever seen. And all your lonely nights in the city of lights are much like  all these crowded bars I so often find my stupid self stumbling through.  My, my what a mess was made of my head  when I heard what you'd been through that day It appears a violent storm's passed through you recently. Letters meant to be sent have been torn. The phone lies off the hook, on the floor. All these "I'm sorry"s and "I miss you"s are useless, I fucked this one up long ago. And all your lonely nights in the city of lights are much like  all these crowded bars I so often find my stupid self stumbling through.  Fuck you Aurora, You took my only friend. And although it's all my fault, the blaming myself had to come to an end so I say: Fuck you Aurora, You took my only friend. You wont catch me behind the wheel of a Chrysler ever again.

      Oh wait, nevermind. What a dick I am. I didn't see it before but now i do. I'm the biggest dick in the world.  I'm so dumb and immature and i have no idea what I'm talking about and everything I do is just the biggest mistakes ever. Actually, I'm a mistake myself.  I'm just a total worthless accident.  No seriously, someone slit my throat.  no.  SERIOUSLY.  someone just slit my throat.

      My head feels weak and suddenly. It’s clear to see, it’s not them, but me who’s lost my self-identity. And I hide behind these books I read, while scribbling my poetry. Like art could save a wretch like me, with some ideal ideology that no one could hope to achieve. And I'm never real, it's just a sketch of me

      My mind wanders as I'm trying not to fall in love with you Cause everytime I awake I ponder on my mistakes of What I said, it is always my esteem that I sure lose Playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you  I can't help myself anymore Rehearsing my thoughts as I'm too scared to come to your door I pushed it all aside just to stand next to you But now you won't talk to me for something that i didn't do  It's not gonna work  And i'm trying not to think of you I'm all confused as I think of the things that I would do I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside My emotions are something that I will always hide my ways   Thats right, blink 182- 21 days.

      relay for life was fun. our team raised $1,096. and thats not too bad. next year is a minimum of $500 raised per person on my team so you can make the decision if youre ready to take on that kind of thing. be ambitious.  throughout the night i had the some conversations that had the potential of being very intellectually stimulating. since it was like 2 in the morning they werent, but the idea that they could be sometime was enough.  carter told me to wake him up if he fell asleep but then i accidentally did too. we were the only ones in sleeping bags and everyone else had like little rag blankets, but hey i warned everyone.  much to our whole teams dismay, there were no pizzas at midnight and the donuts in the mornign left much to be desired. im still on erics computer. kareokee was fun.   ... and tonight, we skate...

      Relay for Life should be fun.  Hopefully I can stay awake all night.  I haven't actually raised any money yet, but it's ok, I still have 4 hours.  My legs are so sore.  I guess that's what happens when you don't run for 5 months.  Oh well, I will soon get into the swing.  Emma said there is gonna be a job opening at Ace soon.  I will believe that when I see it.  I show up there practically every week asking for a job.  Why can't they just fire Mike Murray and hire me?  It seems reasonable.  He does not have good customer service.  One time Aud, Court, and I went there to buy some lacker and he asked us if we were high.  That idiot.  How is it that he got into discovery and I didn't?

      buried in dune gold crystal and soon a storm dehydrates the eye and brings revolution it spins on a sheet one billionth of a second after the beginning we all know there is no fate at one point because what ends up on the ball of our feet are blisters to peer over the wall that seperates the blue eyes from the brown wondering where the bones go when i sucked her nipple like i was her child it spilled from her gut the endorphins released when she thought of him in present in past she spoke of past and inhuman burn mutated manipulations left her second guessing but it was love around the circle on wheels interlocking digits mean as much to me as tongues tied in knots and placed surrepticiously above the coffin when both lovers fell into the sky tricking each others genitals manually into believing they were fornicating which explains the double homicide when you look back and find whatever instrument you encumbered to place into your monk lee poo nan Ners. I am sick of getting to the bottom of things.  instead ill scourge the Tops. I am going back in time to kill my ancestor.

      your words lost meaning after they unintentionally broke down the barrier between loss and defeat. i feel inebriated without the high, just the insomniatic impulse to never close my eyes. closing my eyes and revealing my vulnerability is something you could only dream about. i'm as transparently lucid as you.  and you're glass.

      anger was never an issue and if i was asked to wait for years i would have. gladly.time has never been an issue and if you would have been the least bit perceptive you would have known what it was and wasnt about. dragging on and on with different reasons to start fights. theres nothing left to fight about. you dig up the past and blame me for decisions i had nothing to do with. i dont know what this game is and im not sure what the rules are but if its about you winning then ill throw it. and if what matters to you is bringing up things ive done and turning them into reasons to hate me then have at it. it doesnt matter to me anymore. it has never been about me. its always been about you. im tired of listening to it. can't you just let go of whatever hatred you have towards me and move on? this friendship was seriously over-rated. i don't know why you say some of the shit you do. i'm fighting this uphill battle and i have nothing to gain. and you have nothing to lose. what's the point? im all out of energy and too tired to keep this up. i didnt think? because i never think? i can't keep  it up. i don't know what you want. its something i can't provide leave me alone now.

      Its also hard for me to let it slip out.  but you know i thought about it for the longest time.  you got so angry.  but you never thought about it.  you were so concerned about yourself.  about letting people know that you were the one who needed to help. and the comfort. but you had the support, ok? she fucking didnt.  her support moved to england.  she has no blood left.  dont you fucking understand?  how the  FUCK  do you think  SHE  felt?  you just didnt think.   like always. never taking the world into consideration.  never thinking of what youre saying. take your own fucking advice before you tell me what to do.  look back at what you did.  and i felt horrible. thank you. for thaT.

      Should I be happy at the attempt? No. No i should not.  Imitation is not flattery in my head.  It is an attack.  An attack. I need defense.  Any defense.  I'll pull out brutality like my penis from her cunt before ejaculation.  I'm ready.  I've got every name memorized.  Now i just gotta cut them out and glue them to you.  Shouldnt take long I dont need the stupid ones. Just the ones that will rip off your skin when you try to pull them off too fast.  Then maybe youll learn?  No. No you will not.  You do not learn.  You are not a learner.  You are a complainer. A dweller.  An ex-aggerater.

      "And you will hear yourself when the rain begins to fall. Feel the fire Burning inside us all. Remove me For going in unchained. Blow away for yourself or gather again. And, listen to the conversations of the sea. Inside us all lies a quiet beach. If we fall into ourselves we will become free. I myself could use a little clarity. I am so full of love. I am so full of hate. I am so full of these feelings That turn me every which way. I am so full of you. I am so full of me. I am so full of these words That don't tell her a fucking thing."

"here there be tygers"  such ideas find themselves quixotic.  of all times enigma wanted......oh the evolutionary thouroghfare will take us to the horse head nebulae.  we will be dark stars like the first of this assembly line sold out franchise.  a ha.  she who did not look first but talked first anyhow has yet to find that she was not the wax of these mannequins.  we will divide like the dark star.  indigo mitosis drill for oil on asteroids.  energy has been monopolized.  now we float on rocks with no destination.  no destination.  no destination but collision. collision is imminent.

      So is that what you call a getaway? Tell me what you got away with Cause  I've seen more spine in jellyfish  I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids Have another drink and drive yourself home I hope there's ice on all the roads And you can  think of me  when you forget your seatbelt and again when your head goes through the windshield  Is that what you call tact?  You're as subtle as a brick  in the small of my back So let's end this call and end this conversation And is that what you call a getaway? Tell me what you got away with Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed when you say "best friends" means friends forever

These bandages cover more than scrapes, cuts and bruises from regrets and mistakes. I've been hoping your moping  around the street again. I've been tripping from sipping  the dripping dirty water tap. I've been poking a voodoo doll  that you do not know I made. These bandages are anonymity. I've been shaking from making  an awful decision. I've been running and running feels like my head is spinning  round and round Around, Around, Around, Around, Around!

                  I ended up on the couch in the dark attic.  The TV was on I'm almost sure but I was engrossed in conversation with Alyssa who sat next to me.  There was a larger man, near the other end of the room.  I'm almost sure he had a dark beard and was doing some laboratory work paying no attention to the duo of adolescents who were casually exchanging words on his sofa.  I suppose for some reason it took much longer to get into my subconscious but I remember the abrupt entrance of fear of an agile tick that was scurrying around the room.  It looked like a carpenter ant with a huge ass......like the queen of the colony....but you know what its like when it looks different but you KNOW what it is.            I was deathly afraid of this tiny anthropod fiending for my blood.  I knew it wasn't looking for the big bearded man or Alyssa.  No way, it was coming for me.  I kept seeing it and it would run under the couch.  I don't think I ended up killing it but it did go away.  However things got a bit more interesting.  I began kissing Alyssa and running my hand over her vulva because the bearded man had ceased to exist.  Things fast forwarded and I stopped and this is where it went wrong.  I sat up and found that the girl who sat next to me now, who had been Alyssa, was now Katie Colby.  I didn't know what to do.  I was absolutely positive that this had been Alyssa.  I thought maybe I had hallucinated and Alyssa would understand.  Maybe those migraine pills I had woken up to take to end the relentless pounding in my head had altered the appearance of the hell I had put myself into.  Looking around there was that girl now watching TV who colored and styled her hair exactly like mine near the end of the year.  I asked Katie           "What am I going to do?"             She told me "Say you were on a drug and really thought that I was Alyssa."             That didnt fly with me so I didnt say anything, but Katie leaned over and hit a few buttons on the side of the sofa.  A drawer popped out of the bottom and some digital numbers let me know that she had punched in "638 PCP".  She pulled out a small bottle with a migraine pill label and said            "Just tell her you were on this."           I didnt want to one bit.  I thought maybe she'd understand.  But what if she didn't?  I always thought about it.  I still do.  I was convinced that I really had this problem on my hands.  What would the outcome look like?  I instantly became very nervous and very ready to die.           "Why didn't you stop me?"           She grew a large sinister smile and looked to the floor and to the left.  I got the impression that maybe this wasn't the right Katie that was supposed to ruin this,  it was just the face of one of many Katies to put over her.             I said louder "WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME?!"           Before she could answer I found myself sitting on a row of bleachers placently watching a basketball game, or some sports event or academic assembly in the gymnasium of some junior high or maybe just a small high school.  My grandma and mom were sitting beside me......I sat slightly apart from them down the bench, my eyesight fixed on something very important to me.  My grandma was saying something about not being able to give me a ride to summer school.  I wasn't paying attention.  My 2nd grade friends were seated about 6 rows down.  I felt them there in the first place.  I knew that they were talking about me and having not seen me.  Doug had said my name and was pointing two fingers and waving his left arm in my direction.  Next to him was Max, remembered in my head exactly the way he looked the last time I saw him.  Most importantly, sitting apart from Doug and Max like I, was Allysa.  My 2nd grade crush.  Scratch.  My second grade LOVE.   We used to hold hands playing the board games during lunch or breaks.  I was told in junior high, when meeting them all again at TPH, having changed schools between 2nd and 3rd grade, that all the girls had been jealous of Allysa for being able to hold my hand.  She was sitting in that same dress with the same face she had worn for class pictures that year in Mr. Wasinger's class.            When I was in my bed            I was so happy to find it was a dream.             I was so sad that it didn't seem like that long ago.

      I finger myself pretty good. charlie, im not serious about most of the defensive things that i say.  the minute you say "carter,  i think it was kinda uncool that i said a bunch of bogus shit about you for no reason and id rather we just dropped it" is the day i say "man, charlie's a pretty cool guy".  id rather be friends than enemies....if that means anything to you.

      keiko irish drinking song? nice... never would have thought, well actually ya lol i would have but o well. carter, i realize that you are definetly very full of yourself, and that hopefully, you can finger girls better that you finger yourself, and that it is really sad that you are so hypocritical about venting feelings, and that if you really were as smart as you say you are, which to tell you the truth im not saying that you arent(i can only joke about your looks because ive seen you), you would see that you are such a big waste that you should be ashamed of yourself. One more thing, carter, i dont know you that well and i didnt know you that well, but i know enough to be content and happy that i dont know you. go ahead and "vent your problems" dont expect me to read it or care. now...moving on. audd, im not sure if you wrote i miss you to me or not but i miss you. i read that letter you mailed me yesterday and i almosty cried, and i dont cry a lot. thanks. i started thinking about songs that remind ME of YOU, and i got a few but i cant download them, like wrong way by sublime. most of them make me smile, but a few make me sad......

      so i'm a big loser who's just sitting around drinking some diet coke (pop in keiko's house? a shocker i know). allyson just cut my hair, and i like it. it's a change. i'll have to see what the majority thinks.  for some reason i came home instead of hanging out there.  i stopped by audrey's hoping to see steve and her but alas they had departed. so to feel even more pathetic i called BOTH of their cellphones only to have neither of them pick up.  now i'm stuck, your ass belongs to me, the sea is cruel mistress.

      Hey does anyone know if Bert McCracken has aids? Liz told me today that at some concert he just stopped singing and said "I need to get something off my chest, I have aids" and then started singing again.  I hope he wasn't joking cause that's a real asshole thing to joke about, but it would also be horrible if he really was sick.

      Dude charlie, just stop.  you really dont know me and you never did. i know exactly what im talking about.  i dont speak for people to know what im talking about. i speak to vent out my own problems, alright ass head?  just cuz you cant figure it out and dont know everything.  you just gotta sit down and realize that youre not as smart as i am.  and youre definitely not as cool.  and youre MOST DEF not as good looking as i am.  i am also more in touch with my feminine side, and i can finger girls better......but thats partly because im better looking then you are.  and i can do it more because i get more because im smarter than you are too.  and im always right too.  like in an argument, with anyone, but especially with you, im always right.  you know what i mean?

      Today I had one of those days when I wished I was dead.  You know, one of those days when nothing is wrong but the thought of another day in this ridiculously mundane life is just too much to handle.  It was terrible.  Usually I feel like this when a) I realize how god awful busy I am and I have no way of escaping my work load or b) I feel like everyone hates be.  Today both a and b applied.  But I made it through the day so congratulations Sarah.

      You are calm and reposed. Let your beauty unfold. Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones. Spring keeps you ever close. You are second hand smoke. You are so fragile and thin. Standing trial for your sins. Holding onto yourself the best you can. You are the smell before rain. You are the blood in my veins.

      a vivid memory: it started out like any other day by listening to faith hill in your living room and looking at pictures of you in a leopard print speedo. then me trying to go in your room and you stopping me and eventually making it in there to find that it was somewhat dissapointing because it was not nearly as dirty as you had made it out to be.we talked for a few hours in your bed because you keep your room about 40 degrees in the summer and when it got dark and before you left to walk me half way we kissed. i immediately thought you regreted it. but you said you didnt and rode me home. i was on the handle bars and i almost fell off about three times. but you rode me much farther than half way and at dirksen i finally decided to get off and walk and let you go. i turned to go home and you said "come on give me a hug" i dont think any feeling could ever compare to what i felt at that moment. if i could go back and do it again i would do it exactly the same.

      i wrote this on february 4th, 2003  i guess the epitome of pathetic is when youre pouring over old conversations in your head and you stumble upon something funny and you laugh outloud. its that moment when you realize you are incapable of moving on... and you think to yourself... "i'm about as ticklish as a radish." a statement that just seconds ago made you smile now has you on the verge of tears. maybe the fact that you are remembering this conversation word for word is what branded you as "hopeless" in the first place or maybe its the fact that you're still thinking about him after so long. perhaps its the idea of valentine's day being 10 days away and you're left without a valentine, not that it isnt a worthless holiday to begin with. Dateless, loveless, and hopeless all on the same day. it really makes you aware of your surroundings. i guess it makes you wonder too, or maybe it has nothing to do with anything and you are just wondering because you're you and you can't let go. but none the less you are wondering about beginings and endings and relationships and love, because you always are, and you can't figure out why you can't let go. i mean what is so hard about moving on? why do you, after all this time, still get nervous around him and lose whatever lame and pointless stream of conciousness you had flowing before you saw him out of the corner of your eye. Why do you STILL mention the stupid stories you know everyone has heard at least 5 times. why does everything still remind you of him? Why do you stay up late staring at your ceiling thinking maybe he will come save you from this hell and take you away, even for just 15 minutes? Why does it hurt so badly to know he hasn't thought about you this way for over a year, if he even did then? It sucks when you know there's someone who is supposed to read this and never will, and never will care. and i suppose when all is said and done, i will remember this moment as the epitome of pathetic

      the truth is you could tear me apart and leave me bleeding in your bedroom while you go off with your girlfriend. fuck around while i'm dying on the floor. but ill pick up the pieces of my body that are not sprawled out on the ground with one hand holding intestines and the other grasping at a locked door knob that i'm too frail to be capable of turning. but i'll stumble down the halway leaving bloody handprints that won't wash off all over your walls. and they will be the constant reminder of me.. or of her. but in its crippling brevity, my life has seemed to mean nothing to me. i'll choke on the blood one last time before i die at the top of the stairs. one last time i'll catch your eye. she won't have to worry about not trusting you with me. on the other hand, no one knows the crazy things you would like to do with my corpse. tell her you did it for her sake. tell her its one of the sacrafices that had to be made for your love to her. tell her the love she possesses does not go unrequitted and by murdering me you've proven that. but before i shut my eyes that last time i saw you glance up the stairs. your recently iced over glare staring at me and inside youre screaming at me for the mess ive made. i hope during our last form of contact in this unsettling place you can feel the love radiating from my over-dialated pupils. you look back at her and kiss her. your master plan worked. didn't it?

Tell Him that this is Love.

There were mortal wounds inflicted on the sky and incriminating blue stains on my shirt. The shirt you bought for me. Christ it hurts. Like stars in my belly going supernova. I feel like a zombie that refuses to live. Haunting the junkyards and cutting myself on scraps of you. The other day I masturbated to pictures of you at your birthday party.

      Let's just say that now I know where this country throws all its trashy, rude, and greasy...that's right Great America. It was definitely fun though.  I love Audrey, Tray, and Allyson so much.  "Chicken ajitas? How about chicken fahingers?" I felt like we were never going to get away from the rat woman...oh man if i ever look like that, just shoot me and put me out of my misery.  On the otherhand the woman in the leopard mumu/leotard with the leopard bra to match looked quite striking.  I wish all of you that are reading this could've come too...so pretty much Court and Sarah.  I can't get over the face Audrey gave me after the water ride....and Tray with her hair in her face asking "Is it done already?"

      youre the only person i can be with in a situation where not knowing anything is better than knowing it all. make sure to keep our distance as to not upset the neighbors. make our plans around eachother and survive on another life source. we will survive but never thrive. discovering upsetting information about the opposite party has become nothing less than routine. denial is a state i've grown comfortable to living in. youre either far off in the distance or treading softly on my heels. a friendship can always hang on by it fingertips with one person grasping it desperately. as for now you'll hang out with her and ill hang out with him. we'll call eachother time to time with intentions of becoming closer friends. debate our music and our movies and talk about lost love. and the plan will play itself out perfectly. like its been going through my mind. and a day will come when i will finally say  "your coffin or mine?"

      I just got back from Audrey's.  We went skating tonight.  It was ok.  Relay for Life was so much fun.  As disappointed as I was to not "bring a guy back to the tent with me" as Keiko and I so fondly call it, I still had a lot of fun.  Our group didn't really do any walking, but we raised a lot of money so that was pretty cool.  I walked with Mike for a little while and that was pretty cool, even though I think he was only going with me to shut me up.  Courtney thought it was funny that I was walking around in a bathrobe singing at 4 in the morning.  Pat said I looked like Mrs. Doubtfire.

      well carter you could look at some things ive said and maybe start to get it into your thick skull that your not as super-duper as youve hyped yourself up to be...to yourslef...and other....people....right...what steve said o and ill add just one thing, if your gonna write gay crap like you usually do (odd song lyrics and sonsensical jumbles of words ex: "flying glass and metal turned to stereotypical business lobby. clicks of computers and dial tones and the under breath conversations of these demons stuck in their cubicles, filing the paperwork for the thousands.......maybe millions found dead each day. every one needs to go on file " and "There was a larger man, near the other end of the room. I'm almost sure he had a dark beard and was doing some laboratory work paying no attention to the duo of adolescents who were casually exchanging words on his sofa. I suppose for some reason it took much longer to get into my subconscious") then save us blog space and write it on a piece of paper...god. by the way...steve nice of you to finally join us in blogging. actually carter was the reason i started writing too so be sure to write more whenever and about whatever

      Steve Ive never written a post about you.  I dont know what you are talking about. Of course I want attention.  Everyone wants attention. But thats ALL i want?  Hardly.   Why do you feel the need to say anything steve?   am i going to look at this and say to myself "by golly, steve is right about this. i am completely wrong about everything i do and the way i write and act really means nothing at all and its all just a surrepticious ploy to get people to compliment me......."? no i am not.

      So Carter, I find it funny how you write things on your blog about me. So, I'll write something about you. I think that all you want is attention and thats why you act the way you do. Dont try and come up with some stupid remark to try and piss me off. It's not worth it to try and be nice to you if all you do is hate people. Stop being such an asshole to everyone. Get it through your head that people actually like you and stop trying to push them away. You are a disrespectful little bastard who doesn't know a thing about anyone. Don't go around and say that you know people when you really dont even know yourself. Well, I think I'll deal with some other things when I see you next instead of being a coward like some people.

      So I hardly ever post anymore, I should do that.  It's probably cuz I have nothing to say.  I've been swamped with things to do and this summer is just not gonna be long enough for all the shit I have to do.   SO THIS IS FOR EVERYONE ON THE BLOG : I'm sorry for making myself distant.  I'm sorry for blaming you all for my problems.  You are all really great people and I'm sorry that I never really let you know that.  I just hate that this feeling that I don't belong anymore.  No matter what you are my best friends in the world, even if I'm not yours.  But I'm sorry anyways because I know it's my fault.  Somehow everything is my fault.

      flying glass and metal turned to stereotypical business lobby.  clicks of computers and dial tones and the under breath conversations of these demons stuck in their cubicles, filing the paperwork for the thousands.......maybe millions found dead each day.  every one needs to go on file and everyone needs to have a place to go.  apparently I had something a little special but i wasnt the first.  i was just another no name asshole who constantly avoided love.   i could see the cubicles from where i was sitting but the horns and extra heads and pus volcanos that shot from every employees head didnt scare me as much as it probably should have.....though granted I really had no need to be afraid anymore.  fear was for the people on file.  i was sitting on a sofa in the main hall of the building, and i was facing a wooden door.  the kind where the frame and bottom are wood but the top half is a glass pane with CEO in bold black letters, OEC if youre on the inside.  i kind of jumped to conclusions and decided i was supposed to enter that door but $20 says I didnt make that decision myself.  i stood up and there was a stiff crack in my knees.....like id been sitting on that couch for an eternity.  the knob was hot to the touch but i just turned it and walked in, growing aware and apathetic at the same time of the heat that seemed to surround everything.   and there he was when i walked in, sitting at the desk.  the head honcho.  the CEO.  the dark lord.  he didnt have a goatee or a mustache or even goat legs.  im sure he could have those if he wanted to but that dress code was for the people on file only.  instead now, he was a hispanic male in his mid-20's with fair complexion and broad shoulders.  in his little pin stripe suit and skinny tie i was reminded of my last job interview, 4 years before. "you ready?"  he asked with a raise of the eyebrows. "yeah alright," i replied, with an unexpected enthusiasm. he went on to ask questions about my life. "I see here you were a pretty hateful person.  homicidal AND suicidal fantasies......masochistic sexual desire.......atheism.........to me youll do alright." it kinda jolted me when he said the last phrase because it reminded me of an old phrase my friends used to say when i was way younger......like recognizing a mans face that looks similar to that pre school friend you left behind when you moved to iowa. "yeah" i started "i remember i used to get asked if there was one thing i could change about the world, what it would be......my reply was always...." "to downsize the world.  kill off everyone but who you saw fit, says right here." he had taken the words right out of my mouth but even that didnt seem strange. "what position were you actually looking for, friend?" I wasnt quite sure when he asked me but it kinda flipped to the front of my brain and i told him "On-Call 2nd Division JackHammer." his eyes lit up and he chuckled a puff of smoke from his nostrils. "an excellent choice i must say.  you may be better fitted for 1st division with a resumee like this." "i thought that too but once you get into the first division its a lot less actual work and a lot more paperwork.  2nd division gets the fun stuff" i was surprised that i knew anything about what i was talking about.  subconsiously i had this shit down pat. "whatever you say.  youre the boss of your eternity" i thought that sounded corny......the way my highschool counselor used to tell me about my future.  oh well.......not everyone can sound cool all the time i guess. "when do i start?" i asked growing bored with the interview. "hold on, i need a little more info on your experience."    "dont you have that kinda information on that sheet right there?"   "some of it, but if theres anything you wanna add.......?" "uh........i used to play a lot of croquet........."  which was a half lie.  i never played a lot of croquet......but i could handle mallets.  and i had played croquet a few times in my life. "alright then, good luck" it was abrupt but the office melted around me into a pool of blood.  actually it was more like an ocean of blood.  i couldnt see the bottom but i was standing on something about 3 or 4 inches below the surface.  the sky was a pale orange and glowing with a little more intensity just above the horizon.  the blood stretched on all the way to the end. around me the heads of random damned were screaming for help.  they were all calling me strange names. "chris, youve come back!" "jackie you have to pull me out of here we have to escape." all of them were saying about the same things.  i decided that to each of these people i looked like a person that they had loved and trusted.  that would hurt so much more.  i looked down at my hand and it was grasped tightly around the shaft of a large wooden sledge hammer.  i knew what i had to do.  i walked over to the first head stuck up above the blood.  he was yelling at me and crying in french.  i just raised the hammer and struck down. again. again.  his skull finally cracked and his head sank beneath the ocean.  the next level is my best guess at where he went.  on to the next damned...........   i cant hear their screams anymore.  its all the same to me and ive heard every cry for help.  every age. every ethnicity.  both sexes.  theyve all felt my hammer. i always wish that there had been a job like this when i was alive. oh wait, there was.

      this is the last time ill say it. and this is the last time you'll see these words coming from me. i'm still crazy about you and i still think about you all the time. and i fuck. fuck. i dont know. you know what? i don't even know. i could lie to myself for days and never believe it. but i could lie to you and you would. maybe not because my lies are that convincing, but maybe because its what you really really want to believe. if i told you i never thought about you and i was completely over you, youd believe it because its what you want to be the truth. so lets save ourselves the trouble of never knowing what i'm thinking, and relieve ourselves of the awkward conversations im sure to attempt to have with you. and lets just say that from now on im not thinking about you, even though we both know i am. and lets just say im no longer crazy about you. starting today i'm concealing my feelings and ill have you know that im NEVER revealing the way i feel about you until im 25 and engaged to someone who is nothing like you, or anyone ive dated, who really cares about me. and ill tell him a story about a boy who i dated when i was 16 who i never really stopped thinking about. and ill tell him the others because theyre sure to still be in the back of my mind with you. but ill bury you there as of noiw, and this post will be your funeral. im retiring my feelings to the back of my mind and your eulogy will be this confession. that i still think about you and im still crazy about you. but you'll never know. maybe someday you'll change your mind. which you wont. but maybe. and then maybe, which i wont, but maybe, ill consider bringing you back out of the depths of your grave into which i am placing you now.

      A Japanese cartoon, eh James?  I saw one o' thems once.  Let's see what I can remember.  Okay so first of all, my head would have to be a little bean, with real real big eyes.  Get rid of my thumbs.  Make me all shiny.  My boots would be a whole lot cooler, like robot boots.  And for some reason I got blue hair, you gotta have blue hair.  Then there's my mouth:  real tiny when it's closed, ridiculously huge when it's open.  Then you basically just put me in space and let me fly aroudn in cool poses.  They would probably have someone else do the voices.  Japanese cartoons are weird man, but I think I may be on to something with that blue hair.

      I was running on the track this morning and the soccer players were on that little field between the track and Court's house.  I was in the process of running a 1200 when I saw Afshar running across the track in one of those gay ass foam hats while Mr. Schmidt yelled at him for being late.  I laughed silently to myself and fininshed my workout.  Not much of a story?  Well here is another one that is even more funny:  yesterday morning while I was getting into my car after cross country Tracy ran up to me and was like "I can't start my car!"  She didn't know you have to straighten the wheel or else the car won't start.  She was freaking out and I was laughing my ass off.  Maybe you had to be there.

      heres a little jimmy eat world for your viewing pleasure  Hung up here on a web of comfort Taking off with nowhere to go Standing tall with your new cloak armor Making out like it's all been done Its harder than it seems You slip but never fall They'll take you, where you wont come back to me They'll take you, where you wont come back to me Tearing down what we build up so well Laying low, as you came my way Look alive with your head on backwards Going off, when theres nothing wrong It's only in your dreams But it felt like it was real They'll take you where you wont come back to me They'll take you where you wont come back to me Hang loose, my friend dont walk away from me Cause i really think you're cool Is it worth turning back, despite these open hands You're tearing me apart They'll take you, where you wont come back to me They'll take you, where you wont come back to me you need to find yourself

      fraying all the ends, you are the last one who can recognize his friends. and nothing ever changes, you're always exchanging peace of mind for everything. you want everything. you want it all. i can see it in your eyes. i can see right through you. there's nothing to you. you conjure lies. and you'll surround yourself with everyone who says what you need to feel all right. everyone who speaks the words that make you perpetually contrived. they say what you want to hear. say what you want to hear... why can't you be strong?

      Hanging out with the cousin this week, it's nice.  California will be better though, obviously.  Yesterday we went to Hoffman Fest and rode this one ride that flipped over and stuff in this big circle.  We through the little popper thingies from the top and hit some badass mexicans.  After the ride, the operator came up to us and told us that she was worried since the people we shared the ride with were extremely obese.  later we went to vince's and figured out who would be which part for the school musical version of rocky horror picture show: vince- dr. frankenfurter, me- janet, dan george- brad, kevin- riff-raff, bryan tyrpin ahh gotta go write later

      And now I'm all alone again Nowhere to turn, no one to go to Without a home without a friend Without a face to say hello to And now the night is near I can make believe he's here Sometimes I walk alone at night When everybody else is sleeping I think of him and I'm happy With the company I'm keeping The city goes to bed And I can live inside my head On my own Pretending he's beside me All alone I walk with him till morning Without him I feel his arms around me And when I lose my way I close my eyes And he has found me In the rain the pavement shines like silver All the lights are misty in the river In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me forever and forever  And I know it's only in my mind That I'm talking to myself and not to him And although I know that he is blind Still I say, there's a way for us  I love him But when the night is over He is gone The river's just a river Without him The world around me changes The trees are bare and everywhere The streets are full of strangers I love him But every day I'm learning All my life I've only been pretending Without me His world would go on turning A world that's full of happiness That I have never known I love him I love him I love him But only on my own.

      i heard from a friend that he's with her again and they laugh like theyve never laughed harder. and this time they mean it and the ring on her finger shows it. its real and theyre making big plans. theyre writing their own vows to profess their love with that personal touch. he tells her shes the only one hes ever loved and he tells her she had always been the first and last. and he says he made some mistakes with a girl from the past but he regrets it all now and tries to forget it. they spend nights talking about the spark of their romance and the love they both felt at first site. on their wedding day the best man came up and pulled him aside. he said, "what about audrey? don't you ever think about her?" and the only reply to this question before the trip down the aisle was, "what? audrey who?"

      I can't imagine all the people that you know  And all the places that you go  When the lights are turned down low.  And  I don't understand  all the things you've seen  but I'm slipping in between  you and your big dreams   it's always you   in my big dreams   and you tell me that it's over  but I can't stand here in a patch of four leaf clovers  and your restless, and I'm naked  you've gotta get out  you can't stand to see me shaking  no  could you let me go?  I didn't think so   and you don't wanna be here in the future  so you say the present's just a pleasant interruption to the past  and you don't wanna look much closer  cuz your afraid to find out all this hope you had sent into the sky by now had crashed  and it did  because of me   and then you bring me home  afraid to find out that you're alone  and I'm sleeping in your living room  but we don't have much room to live   I had these dreams in them I learned to play guitar  maybe cross the country  become a rock star  and there was hope in me that I could take you there  but dammit you're so young  well  I don't think I care   and if I hurt you  then I'm sorry   please don't think that this was easy    then you'd bring me home  cuz we both know what it's like to be alone  and I'm dreaming in your living room  but we don't have much room to live   and konstantine is walking down the stairs  doesn't she look good?  standing in her underwear  and  I was thinking   what  I was thinking   we've been drinking and  it doesn't get me anywhere    my konstantine came walking down the stairs  and all that I could do is touch her long blonde hair  and I've been thinking  it hurts me thinking that these nights when we were drinking no  they never got us anywhere   no   this is because I can spell konfusion with a k  and I can like it   it's to dying in another's arms and why I had to try it   it's to  Jimmy Eat World  and those nights in my car  when the first star you see may not be a star    I'm not your star    isn't that what you said?  what you thought this song meant   and if this is what it takes  just to lie with my mistakes  and live with what I did to you  all the hell I put you through   I always catch the clock  it's 11:11  and now you want to talk   it's not hard to dream   you'll always be my konstantine    my konstantine, they'll never hurt you like I do  no they'll never hurt you like I do  no, no, no no no no no no   this is to a girl who got into my head  with all the pretty things she did  hey  you know   you keep me up in bed   this is to a girl who got into my head  with  all these fucked up things I did   hey  maybe  baby  you could keep me up in bed  my Konstantine   you spin around me like a dream we played out on this movie screen   and I said   did you know I missed you?  I miss you   and then you bring me home  and we'll go to sleep, but this time, not alone, no no  and you'll kiss me in your living room  I know  you'll miss me in your living room  cuz these nights I think maybe that I'll miss you in my living room   we don't have much room   I said does anybody need that room?  because we all need a little more room  to live     my Konstantine

      audrey, the best Zodiac Match for your personality is Aquarius   Aquarius, the Water Bearer (January 21 to February 19): This friendly and thoughtful partner is just your type. Initially, an Aquarius may catch your attention by showing you their intellectual side and optimistic outlook. But as you get to know them better, you're likely to be even more drawn to an Aquarian's idealistic resolve and focus on making positive change. People born under this sign are frequently capable of seeing both sides in any dispute. This can make them quite talented when it comes to finding creative solutions in your relationship. Your Aquarius may be a bit headstrong at moments, but they'll also tend to look for the bright side in times of trouble. In the bedroom, you'll likely find the Water Bearer both discrete and cautious. An Aquarian will ordinarily make sure that all areas of your relationship are strong before plunging into sex. Overall, Aquarians are solid, unwavering partners and complex people. So, it may take you a little extra time to get to know your Aquarian match, but it's apt to be well worth the wait.

      "What came first, the music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos, that some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable?

      I guess we've had our fun but it seems our fun is over now And that's all right. It's all right. Time for me to move along And after all is said and done. I'll be all right. It's all right. Tell me something that's sure to break my heart cause everything's my fault. And I know I deserve to be alone cause everything's my fault.    Here we go again unsuccessful to make amends.    And that's all right. It's all right. I'm trying as hard as I can but I just can't seem to understand. And that's all right. It's all right. Tell me something that's sure to break my heart cause everything's my fault And I know I deserve to be alone cause everything's my fault. I guess it's over now your honesty has all run out And that's all right It's all right. I just can't seem to see how the hell you can make believe. And that's all right. It's all right  ....Everything's my fault...

      Lyrics to The Drama Summer  We could wait for the wind to blow Or give me a look so cold...It gives me chills  And ends  the summer war   My eyes roll  Around and over and again  Falling down, dizzy with sun stroke  I'll be there  And i'll try to identify, try to look through the gray skies in your eyes..  I'll pick up everything you left behind  Cross your fingers, and pray for winter  I'll be there  Painting the town your favorite color.  Guess i'll call or see you around....yeah  Guess i'll call or see you around.  Guess i'll call or see you around....yeah  Guess i'll call or see you around.  I'll call, or see you around.  I'll call, or see you around.  I'll call, or see you around.  I'll call, or see you around.

And I wouldn’t ever presume to try and make everything better with a conversation, so that’s not with this is -- but I just wanted to tell you, I wanted to say about everything that happened last spring... I’m sorry. I’m sorry for my part in it. And I’m sorry for the pain I know it caused you. But mostly I’m sorry because I miss our friendship. And however far off it may be, I look forward to the day that we can be friends again. So, until then..."  dawsons creek

      I know im not your favorite record. its getting late.  im getting tired. its almost time for bed. this is side one. flip me over. bhahahahaha. where is your boy? I may be an accident but i'm still trying. Dead On Arrival. i contemplate the day we wed. the god of wine is crouched down in my room you let me down i said it. well this drama is a bore. and i dont want to play no more. the bluebird of happiness is on my monitor and i just realized tat just now when i looked at it. i initially pulled it off of a birthday card my aunt sent me. liked it so much i stuck it on this monitor and its been there ever since. need to install scanner. need to scan pictuers. need to develop picturesl they are from march for christs sake.  nah i dont want to grow it out nah  so im just about ready for bed. ready to change out of these clothes and jump between the sheets.. i want to mosaic some more. im missing it. lame? yeah but i really do. so m maybe its my hidden talent  so i was thinking about college. i wasnt really i was just so bored that it seemed cool to take the virtual tours at school websites? cool you say? YES I SAY! so columbias cool and uw madison. actually that websites pretty dumb but i like the school anyway  im seeing how long i can ramble on before im stopped by some unexplainable force. i think in now and then if i had to be a character i would probably be placed as.... teeny or.... roberta? farewelll chris legner youre signing off.  just like on apollo 13  houston we have a problem  im pretending none of this is happening. ill leave the worrying to you. and here i go  im finally free from the ups and downs bed time has come for me.

      ive decided that the worst feeling is thinking youre hungry and you eat something, but you werent even really hungry and the weird, empty feeling is still there. i love late night walks by myself. new york city is evil. i think i should just stop eating because everytime i do, i just feel sick. i cant wait to go on vacation. i just need to get out of this state for a while. note to anyone: feel free to burn me cds for the 12 hour road trip. this is supposed to be a road trip, all were doing is driving. i took a nap outside today. i wish i had a hammock. i wish the june bug i killed two nights ago wasent still sitting on my computer desk. pizza hut buffet tomorrow. should be fun. awkward is the new cool. no doubt about it. my parents say that my sleeping habits are really bad and i should try to change them. i cant wait to wake up tomorrow and realize i dont have to work. ive never been so alone and ive never been so alive. so many songs in my head. becoming what you hate. im off. living life likes its going out of style.

      im manipulative. and a huge bitch. i deserve to die right? right? is that what you think of me? you used to like me sooo much!!!! and now what you hate me? for somethign that is seriously NONE  of your business whatsoever. god that is so fucking annoying. i thought you were so cool. i really thought so. and now what is this? you just turn into some psycho bitch and tellyour online cronies that im some manipulative person and they respond telling you what you want to hear? is that it? its really pathetic that you feel compelled to involve yourself in a situation that is about 25 years too young for you to be concerned with. and its more pathetic that you need to discuss it with people who youve never met but feel like it is completely justifiable to email back and forth personal details of situations that dont remotely involve you. god its sad. i used to think you were SOOOO cool. and it is really disheartening to learn that youre just like everyone else. you need to grow up.

      There's an old joke. Uh, two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of 'em says, "Boy, the food at this place is really terrible." The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and such small portions." Well, that's essentially how I feel about life. Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly.

      They'll never hurt you like i do.   The feelings change so fast. Safety scares them away. I can't bring myself to say it's my own advice I need. Nowhere and then nowhere. Living trapped inside the chase.    i'm through talking the strangest thing but I feel safe when i'm lonely don't take too much cause you'll get burned if it's all at one time    if you let me have my way i swear ill tear you apart.   Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say   Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me Hide the details I don't want to know a thing

      if she was meyou would hate me. because the evil things that PEOPLE do who you thought were your friends but youve learned OBVIOUSLY arent because they don't even talk to you before drawing conclusions and passing judgements and its about time that i got sick of you. well hey whatever. so who is this post about? youre wondering is it about you? well if youre wondering, i'm sure yes part of it is about you. so does this make any sense? no because if it did it would be a lot meaner. BEST FRIENDS MEANS I PULL THE TRIGGER. BEST FRIENDS MEANS YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE.  would you just stop the hating? no one cares about whatever youre trying to prove.

      Satellite night is how it all starts Over horizon dreams And then you appeared dressed in black You drew the fear out of me As we looked out to the sea Freezing in waters so blue 3AM seems just fine The nightcrawlers have left the bay Could I have so much more to say to you? Did you notice? Fate seemed shy an hour ago Look where that hour got us now Slowly.. I'll wait for you holding all honesty As I watch the sea When you leave here Take in all the sounds of ocean waves just glistening We could just run away We weren't made for this anyway A U.F.O. could steal us now We'd leave the beach to soar against the night sky Over the high tides Could these hours add on to our life stories?  Now it's just another day without the sand beneath our feet I'll never let it go I'll keep repeating it all over and over and over Heaven's skies in your eyes You know they fit just fine I heard that song today it just bled of goodbye That summer's gone But the late night hours will still be worn And on the weekends out with your friends Will you remember that mindnight wind aching? Or the suprise before the sunrise It's just every night I miss it so well...

      Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day. Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way. And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear me  say "That was the longest damn day."  Do you ever truly feel that it's a waste of time  to live a day? I mean, deep inside have you convinced yourself there's much  more to get out of the way? But, for me it's that last baby moment before I wake. It bless my soul, caress my heart, leave me wishing for a brighter day.  Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day. Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way. And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear me  say "That was the longest damn day."  Do you ever truly dream and stay inside them before you wake? I mean, deep inside can you relax the mind and grab the minute like the last one to save? Well, for me it's that last baby moment before I rise. It fills me with wonder, it bless my soul, catch the dream before I open my eyes.  Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day. Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way. And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear me  say "That was the longest damn day."  One, two, three more days will never be enough for me. One, two, three more lifetimes will bless my soul for my eyes can see That I can wake up if I want to. But I'll just stay inside of my mind. One, two, three more days will never be enough for me. One, two, three more lifetimes will bless my mind for my soul is free.  Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day. Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way

      while sitting behind register #3 today at work i was thinking about having our OWN registers. you could put all your stuff and anything you wanted on it. (side note- i know its lame to think about this.)  i know on mine i would include a bunch of signs so people could check themselves twice before entering my line. such signs would include...  1. I'm not a map, dont ask me for directions. 2. No, you cant keep the hangers cheap ass.  3. Swipe your own goddamn card. 4. No glassware allowed. 5. If you're buying a suit and you're in this line, fool get the fuck out. 6. Yes, that is our biggest bag. 7. Bag your own shit.

      OH CANDY GREEN STRAT, how i have missed you so. minnesota was fun, as fun as having fun gets when it comes to having fun with the family. if that makes sense. man i missed 3 calls while i was away! i am too popular for you. you love my sarcasm. i plan on staying online very late tonight for i have missed a whole weeks worth of looking up lyrics and looking at peoples livejournals that i dont know. my brother needs to shut the fuck up. i just spent 12 hours in the car with him. i cant stand much more.

      Why does the sun go on shining? Why does the sea rush to shore? Don't they know it's the end of the world? Cause you don't love me anymore...  Why do the birds go on singing? Why do the stars glow above? Don't they know its the end of the world? It ended when i lost your love.....  I wake up in the morning and i wonder, Why everything's the same as it was..... i can't understand, no- i can't understand, How life goes on the way it does....  Why does my heart go on beating? Why do these eyes of mine cry? Don't they know it's the end of the world? It ended when you said: good bye.

      okay. i had fun this summer. i have golf tomorrow. i should probably go to bed early, but i really want to do something. ill probably end up looking at my buddy list the whole night waiting for someone to come on. oh, and ill call audrey one more time. but i dont want to seem like a stalker...calling all the time and stuff. whatever. i cant wait for the "O.A.R." concert. its going to be awesome. i really want to see "Fall Out Boy" too. so, its 8 and im still bored. i keep looking at my phone to see if ive missed any calls. im listening to music so thats why i cant hear it ring. but, its not going to ring so i have nothing to worry about. tony hawks boom boom huckjam tour is coming october 17th at the united center. it would be pretty cool to go. tickets are $25-75. im debating whether or not to call audrey again. im pathetic. so, i was thinking earlier. well, yeah, i was thinking. thats it. so a couple of days ago this guy on the golf course started calling me keith. i didnt want to be mean and say, "hey, my names steve". he looked and sounded drunk. he was fishing too. the guy crossed our fairway with a fishing pole hanging out of the back of his cart. he was cruising. yeah thats it. if you dont have one anymore fucking get another one. well its now 8:12. ive been thinking about what to write so thats why its taking so long. well ill call audrey in ten minutes lol.

      just live. advice is dont spend your junior year doing homework. but more importantly dont slack off for your entire life and then expect to be ableto just pick it up like its a normal routine. because its not. and dont expect too much from yourself, but dont sell yourself short either. dont let procrastination get the best of you but dont spend more than 3 hours on homework a day. dont wait till the last minute to write essays. dont forget your friends. dont be judgemental. have empathy towards other people. be compassionate.  be everything that i'm not.

      it cant go unsaid.  audrey rules everybody.  actually thats gonna confuse some people i hope.  cuz its like, well shit does she really rule everybody?  is everybody ruled by her?  or then you switch it up and she just rules period and im just informing everybody. see its missing that little coma so its a crazy one.  lots of people talking.  there will be followers and then the protesters who say commas......hey wait ive been spelling comma as coma. no wait it was just once. whoooops.

      After going to a very small catholic grade school, I told my parents I needed more than eight friends.  So my sister, Gloria, who's a year older, and I got to go to a public high school in Saugerties, NY.  In the morning my sister would be like, ''You're kidding me.  You're not going to wear that shirt."  And I was like, "You're right.  What am I thinking?''  So instead I'd change my shirt and, of course wear the ''Who Farted?" one instead.  I never had a serious girlfriend in school.  I think I went out with a couple of my sister's friends, but her thing was like, ''No ones good enough for my brother," and I was the same way with her.  I'd hook up with people, but just kind of hang out with them.  I went to the prom with this cool girl named Lori Mullen.  Most people rent limousines-we took a U-Haul truck and turned it into an apartment. -Jimmy Fallon

      just a comment about walking up and down the stairs at schaumburg high school: i hate when youre walking up the stairs and youre behind a kid with this huge backpack so naturally its right in your face. and i also hate when youre walking down the stairs behind a kid who has a huge backpack because you cant walk because your knees keep hitting it.

      Miss Lippy, the part of the story I don't like, is that the boy stops looking for his dog after an hour. He just sits on his porch like a goon, he didn't put up posters or anything. That boy's gotta think "You got a pet, you got a responsibility! You can't just look for an hour and call it quits. So you get your ass out there and you find that fuckin' dog!"

      today after falling on and over the gate two or three times and falling down the stairs, my dad said and i quote, "court you are on drugs, im taking you to rehab" and me, "oh yeah dad the first sign of drug addiction is tripping over gates" "court, go to bed."  well ive already explained this to skippystds away message but heres for all you other fans out there, you know when youre in the middle of doing something, like tripping, but you know its too late to stop it? like you cant help it so youre just like well i guess im goin down. thats so funny because you know its coming so youre like grinning as you crash and plunge into the ground (earths crust).  this one time my dad bought these desert boots off of ebay. which is funny in itself but its also weird because my dad never buys things off of ebay. ecspecially not graphing calculators.  this post will end. catch my sarcasm.  have you ever been like talking to your relatives and like completly droned them out and been thinking like, god you are so boring. thats a con of fam parties. theyre arent many pros. bye.

      everything has got a sense of permanence attached to it sucks you in and feeds you until finally you're used to it and now  you're so dependant  now  you're so defensive  now you're finding reasons why their all wrong so in love with all your vices  you can't change or move on  and it comes to this such tragic endings you shake your fist   just stop pretending   it comes to this such tragic endings it's hit or miss just stop pretending now everyone keeps asking you "what exactly happened?"  you've got all these  excuses  but  you don't have an answer  because you don't know your self  you don't know your own weaknesses    you're always innocent    because  you're never honest   so  wrapped up in your perspective   morality has become an opinion

      Carter Schultz, you fucking rock. Mike O'Neill, you're funny as hell. The V show is going to be very cool I guarantee that Mike will rock ice. "My love for you is like an endless river flowing from the mountains."  It's a classic line. I kind of want to dress up like a goblin for Halloween. Like the crazy ass hobgoblin I was dressed up as one night at Audrey's.  I looked amazing. Good night, and rest assured that the sun will rise in the morning. Love to almost everyone. 'Night.

      MARY: In honor of Pacey’s birthday I’ve made his favorite: chipped beef on toast. PACEY: It’s Doug’s favorite, actually. My favorite is spaghetti and meatballs. MARY: But -- when you were a kid, you always begged me to make chipped beef on toast. PACEY: Right, I forgot. All these years, I’ve pretended to hate chipped beef on toast, in a vain attempt to mask my true feelings of love. DOUG: Well, I love chipped beef on toast. PACEY: Yes, that fact is well established. Thank you.

      satellite night is how it all starts Over horizon dreams And then you appeared dressed in black You drew the fear out of me As we looked out to the sea Freezing in waters so blue 3AM seems just fine The nightcrawlers have left the bay Could I have so much more to say to you? Did you notice? Fate seemed shy an hour ago Look where that hour got us now Slowly..I'll wait for you holding all honesty As I watch the sea When you leave here Take in all the sounds of ocean waves just glistening We could just run away We weren't made for this anyway An I.F.O. could steal us now We'd leave the beach to soar against the night sky Over the high tides Could these hours add on to our life stories?  Now it's just another day without the sand beneath our feet I'll never let it go I'll keep repeating it all over and over and over Heaven's skies in your eyes You know they fit just fine  I heard that song today it just bled of goodbye   That summer's gone But the late night hours will still be worn  And on the weekends out with your friends Will you remember that mindnight wind? Or the suprise before the sunrise It's just every night I miss you so well...
