      For those slow people out there who don't get the Web site name, check out an old song you might recognize:   Free Your Mind   I wear tight clothing and high heel shoes It doesn't make me a prostitute I like rap music wear hip-hop clothes That doesn't mean that I'm sellin dope Oh my please forgive me for having straight hair It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heirs I might date another race or color Doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers  Chorus: Free your mind  and the rest will follow ,  be colorblind, don't be so shallow (before you read me you gotta learn how to see me)  So I'm a sista Buy things with cash That really doesn't mean that all my credit is bad, So why dispute me and waste my time, Because you think that the price is too high for me I can't look without being watched You rang my buy before I made up my mind Oh now attitude why even bother I can't change your mind  you can't change my color   Anyway, I really like what the (En Vogue) song says and I think it's good advice for anyone out there who wants to live their life right. Too many people don't bother seeing others beyond the confines of their own stereotypes and prejudices, and I think if more people could free their minds, so much of the strife and horrible things going on in this world would end.

      Why do so many of these start out with "Bush is a goober"? Becuase he does so many things to make him one. Like denying  urlLink the U.N. $34 million  because he thinks that they are supporting coerced abortions with their family planning group in China. The British reports says there are no forced abortions in China, the  U.S.  report says there are not, and he decides to ignore both and use some Kemp something act to make it legal to keep the money we had already earmarked for them. And the U.N. came right out and said that women have  fewer  abortions because of their family planning work because  they teach about contraceptives and not getting pregnant in the first place !!!!  Bush says we will send the money to family planning through another agency, but this other agency covers something like 60 fewer countries and doesn't even touch countries like Afghanistan (hmm...). The U.N. Population Fund covers more than 140 countries and doesn't do abortions (although I have to insert here that I think that is a crock of shit, too...not only is he trying to control U.S. women's bodies, he's trying to control all women's bodies. Also, did you know that until just in the last month, military women could not have abortions overseas? They had to come home to do so, if at all.) Bush is just listening to those right-wing conservative bastards again, the same ones that shoot abortion doctors because they are  pro-life . I can't believe this, and I hope the U.N. and other countries start withholding something we really need now, too. Maybe it would teach Bush a lesson. Or at least piss us off enough to vote him out of office (or perhaps this urlLink  corporate scandal with Harken  he is becoming embroiled in will take care of it for us).

      Again, Bush is a goober. But today, the state of Virginia takes precedence. It is now a law that all schools have to display the nation's motto, which just so happens to be "In God we trust." Isn't that lovely and convenient? Especially in Virginia. This is why that phrase needs to be taken off the currency and whatever else they use it for and gotten rid of. It violates the separation of church and state, and as long as it exists, people in this country will never truly be free. Well, getting rid of the slogan won't free us, but it certainly would go a long way to getting rid of silly laws like this one. Of course, no one in Virginia is pitching a fit because we are the bible belt. I can't even write a letter to the editor because I work at the newspaper, and I can't do anything about that school policy yet, I don't think, because I don't have any kids in school. ... Of course, I could sue on the basis that I will have kids someday, and I want the law gone before they enter school and are forced to view it (they put it in the front area as you walk in the door! The state of Virginia is paying to frame these things...of course, the posters themselves were paid for by an anonymous donation of $3000. Give you one guess where that came from.).  All right, I'm going now. I will keep you updated as to what I am doing about this unholy mess.

      Computer makers and programmers. Granted, I probably couldn't have posted this rant unless some lovely programmer wrote this lovely code so I can be a slack-ass and not learn  urlLink HTML , but after tonight, I still hold a vendetta. I work at a newspaper, and we all work on deadline. So when the guy next to me (who was doing  urlLink A1 , front, most important page) yelled at his computer for Dr. Watson-ing 15 minutes til deadline, I felt some sympathy. However, when his page came back up and  there was nothing on it , I started mentally cursing computer programmers (especially those involved with  urlLink Quark ). Well, it's now 40 minutes past deadline, and he is just finished rebuilding his pages (which I may add, have not been proofed or even slotted, and it's my headlines that went on in rim....I just hope nothing is wrong with them *fingers crossed* For those non-journalists out there, that means no one read my fucking headlines...libelous or not, people will read them tomorrow morning).    Things like this should not happen!    We are in the 21st century and computers have been around for a while now. We should have got this whole Dr. Watson bug crash problem licked by now. Or perhaps we are progressing too fast now, and our problem solving skills have not kept up. It might've been slower in the days when editors did paste-up (or whatever it was called back in the day), but I can guarantee they never had a problem right before deadline with a crass. Well, maybe they did...the wax machine coulda gone on the fritz, I suppose.  Well, I am going home and to bed now. I will leave you with this quote from a wonderful wordsmith:   "Progress might have been all right once, but it has gone on too long."   -  Ogden Nash

       urlLink  If you are  urlLink against  urlLink   abortion, get a vasectomy. Are you a woman against abortion? Don't have one. It's really a simple solution. As for me, I'll quote another slogan: "Keep your rosaries off my ovaries." In other words, it's none of your damn business what I or anyone else does with our bodies. I don't think I would ever have an abortion (medical circumstances withstanding), but I do support the right for every woman to  urlLink choose  whether she should have one. My reasoning is thus: I have the money and the support system in place to help me to raise a child right. However, many women do not, and therefore should not be forced to bring a child into this world. Granted, adoption is an option, but a pregnancy still prevents a woman from working for some length of time, and for some, that could mean entrenching themselves even further in debt, in poverty, etc. Don't believe me? Check out Barbara Ehrenreich's book, " urlLink Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By In America ". Read that, and then tell me that it's possible to miss even one day of work for some of these women. Adoption doesn't always pay enough money to cover the expenses of everything involved in following through with a pregnancy.   In all honesty, logical reasons aside,  urlLink extreme religious activists  who keep shoving their beliefs down everyone else's throats just piss me off in general. However, it's one thing to try to keep 'under god' in the pledge; it's entirely another thing to try to govern my body as well. Until your churches and groups start paying taxes, stay out of politics and keep it in your own congregation, where it belongs.

      Just tweaking the site again tonight :-) I love new toys. Anyway, on topic. Not to badmouth anyone  too  badly, but the whole electronics industry has really annoyed me today. Shane left today to go be with his mom for a few days while she is having surgery, and so I knew I would be bored tonight. So of course, I called up Michael to see if he wanted to go to Blockbuster. We got our DVDs, and settled in on the couch to watch the wonderful  urlLink Janeane Garofalo  in " urlLink Wet Hot American Summer ." Then I realized Shane hooked up all of our electronic stuff yesterday (DVD, VCR, Playstation, stereo, etc.), and once again, I had no idea how to work the controllers (there are 5 now, for those who are keeping count.). After an hour of playing with all the buttons, we gave up and Michael went home. When Shane called, he talked me through it and all was good.   This would not have happened if the people who make these things would just get together and make all the interfacing and hooking together a simple process. Why does it have to be so damn complicated, that the cable has to run through the VCR and the DVD sound has to come from the stereo and not the TV and etc.? I'm not a stupid person, but let me see more than two controllers, wires, etc., and I would rather run screaming for the hills and all their backward no-frills living than attempt to figure it out. There has got to be a better way to get this stuff to work. If anyone out there can come up with an easy way to hook everything together, let me know, then go out and write a book or sell the product ... 10 percent of all your profits is all I want for giving you the idea ;-)

      First post. A lot of pressure for it to be a good one. The whole thing came about when I read an article about 'The Pulse' about some guy's segment called "Who's Annoying Me Today." Of course, I thought, this would be a wonderful forum for me to have, especially since those who know me know that I already tell everyone and their brother what I think and believe. That, and all this pent-up anger toward Bush and Ashcroft has to go somewhere. Kudos to the people who get the Web site address and where I got it from. I'll tell the rest of you slow people later.

      I see that no one has posted in a while, so I just wanted to say hi.  I'm too mentally exhausted tonight to rant about working with old people, the Florida election fiasco etc.  I did, however, want to let you know that there's been a documentary about the election called "Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election" released.  It investigates the voter purging, etc.  I want to get Brian in on this, too.  I think he'd have a lot to add...  -Shannon

      Something I recently posted on  urlLink beliefnet  in response to a bunch of people taking pot shots at atheists. It's a bit mean-spirited, but that's the anger coming out at what some of those posts were saying. I took a few liberties with it, since I really don't know what my brother and father think, but I'd like to think they believe the same as I.  While I think that the  urlLink Boy Scouts  are being really silly about this whole thing, it's their right, unfortunately. However, I know that none of my money will ever go to them again. Nor will my sons ever be allowed to join such a group. It would be tantamount to allowing them to join the  urlLink Nazi youth groups  so prevalent in the 1930's. My father was a scout leader and my brother was a scout for years, and they are both ashamed of the recent "values" of the Boy Scouts, including their views on homosexuality as well as atheists. But then, what do you expect from an organization that is funded by  urlLink a bunch of hypocritical right-wing fundamentalists ? These "christians" are no better than the Muslim extremists who blew up the towers for their beliefs. Any sort of extremist group that preaches intolerance, directly or indirectly, is a detriment to the society it exists in. And now, due to the BSA's current agenda, a group that used to do good things has earned the extremist label for themselves. Way to go.  On another note: Jeffinthearmy says: "If we keep giving in on these atheists telling us how to run our christian based clubs and programs, we might as well act just as though there really is no God."  I don't believe the atheists are telling you how to run your faith-based programs. Atheists are just against federal money going to those programs (ever hear of a little thing called separation of church and state?), as well as being having our national pledge include the words "under God" when not everyone in this nation believes in a god. Do what you want with your programs, but don't expect my tax money to go to it, and don't force my children to say a pledge that is not true to all Americans (and it is forced in some classrooms, whether it is allowed or not) nor look at posters on their school walls that say "In God We Trust" (such as the grand state of Virginia is now financing for all schools). We are just asking for equality, nothing more.  "It's hard to be religious when certain people are never incinerated by bolts of lightning." - Calvin   A post by another that I thought was relevant. cwgriesel  11/8/02 2:06:53 PM  As to why only BSA is having this problem and not GSUSA. I don't think it has anything to do with men. In addition to Girl Scouts, the YMCA (M is for "Men", C is for "Christian", by the way) allows atheists and gays. So does Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Campfires and every other youth organization with national stature.  BSA stands alone as a national youth program that rejects of gays and atheists. Who knows why? One tried and true technique is the old "follow the money" game. Over 30% of BSA's funding and membership is from the LDS church. The largest participating groups after that are representatives of the Catholic and Methodist churches.  -Mel

      Since my last post, Lott has stepped down ... mainly because the GOP doesn't want to offend black voters, if you ask me. He would have stayed forever if our lovely Virginia senators hadn't spoken up.   On another note, isn't it fun watching the political game on CNN? Within hours of Lott stepping down, we have (Virginia senators) Allen and Warner both ingratiating themselves publicly with Frist (the candidate to take Lott's job). Warner, in particular, was amusing: 'Yeah, I was Frist's sounding board ... we're the best of friends ... *loud kissing sounds heard in the general vicinity of Frist's ass* '  The scramble begins.  As for Frist, if what I hear is true and he's buddy-buddy with ole Bushie, that just makes me so happy. *sound of gun going off in the general vicinity of my temple*  -Melissa

      From an article I read today:  "Trent Lott realizes he offended people with his remarks on segregation, but still can ably lead Senate Republicans, his incoming deputy said Saturday. "Other GOP colleagues said Lott’s apology should end the matter. “This is a forgiving country,” said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who becomes GOP whip in the new Congress in January. “He knows he made a big mistake. It’s time to forgive him and to move on. And I think he can still be a very effective majority leader in the Senate.”  Yeah ... that's right. The GOP wants us to forgive and forget this man's mistake. Funny how they change their tune when it's not Clinton on the stand.  -Melissa

      The next time you visit the nation's capital, your every move may be watched and recorded. The DC Police Department, without public knowledge or city council approval, has set up a centralized video surveillance network. The system can bring together video feeds from police cameras on streets and buildings, in neighborhoods, within the city's subway system and even at public schools. With the flip of a switch, officers can zoom in on people a half-mile away.    This system of cameras could be used to monitor peaceful protests and the activities of innocent people throughout the city.  This information could then be misused to blackmail, intimidate or bully people who are exercising their freedom of speech, freedom of peaceful assembly, or just going about their daily lives. Many are  urlLink protesting  this blatant violation of privacy.  Just letting ya'll know.     -Shannon

      Check out the  urlLink story  about Laura Bush canceling her poetry shindig because of the protest.  "Refusing" By Gregory Orr on the  urlLink Poets Against War  Web site  Refusing the invitation I was not given, being given instead the invitation to refuse. Which I accept. Am grateful for. The chance to be part of the poet's chorus, the caucus of those whose politics is obvious and earnest. Whose wishes are simple: sensible diplomacy, everything to be negotiated. Tough bargaining, but easy on the violence. That's what we poets learned from poems: it's all on the table, but it's stupid to break up the table with an axe, to splinter the chairs.  And it's madness to ask poets to celebrate, when people can't even breathe deeply for fear of war's imminence.  Other  urlLink anti-war Web sites .  -Melissa

      It's the 30th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, and the amount of ignorance on  urlLink message boards  recently is really annoying me. Here's a recent post I put up on  urlLink beliefnet.com .   First of all, just to straighten out some people who don't bother to check facts:    urlLink The Alan Guttmacher Institute  surveyed all known U.S. abortion providers during the past two years. The new report offers comprehensive data from 1996 to 2000 from all 50 states and the District. It found that: •The number of abortions fell from 1.36 million in 1996 to 1.31 million in 2000, a 4 percent decline. •The abortion rate declined 5 percent, to 21.3 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. •In 35 states, including Virginia, and in the District, abortion rates fell. In Virginia in 2000, the rate dropped 5 percent, to 18.1 abortions per 1,000 fertile women. In the District, the rate fell 39 percent, to 68.1 abortions per 1,000 fertile women.  •There were an estimated 37,000 early medical abortions done in the first six months of 2001. This shows a small but significant use of the newly legal chemical process called mifepristone, formerly known as RU-486. Abortions are declining, institute researchers said, because of lower teen pregnancy rates, more contraceptive choices, an aging female baby boomer population and a shrinking pool of abortion providers (down to 1,819 providers in 2000).  So teen pregnancies are down, and abortions are down, and if you bother to keep up with the news, you'll read that STDs are down as well.  Second of all, most of the people here seem to miss one very big point: Just because you consider something to be immoral does not mean you have the right to impose your morality on anyone else.   So, first thing's first. If you are a man, step out of the debate right now. You have no business in governing a woman's body. (And if you are really that concerned, get a vasectomy, and we won't have this problem.)  Second. Do you really think women want to have an abortion? Yes, we all go around saying, hey, I think I'll get pregnant today because I think an abortion will feel so darn good. Think about it. Not only is it physically painful, but you have to live with it the rest of your life.   Third. Not all abortions are done by single woman. Married women have them, too. If you can't feed another child and you get pregnant in spite of birth control (see where the vasectomy would be good?), you have a choice. Abortion or live off everyone else's taxes. Or you could give your kid up (if you happen to be white and the kid is healthy). That, or you can just abstain from sex. But doesn't the bible tell you to give it up to your husband? (I looked it up - it does: “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord” (Colossians 3:18). "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. (Ephesians 5:22-24)")  Fourth. Familly planning agencies are good things. They tell girls about contraception, safe sex and kinds of other good things. And as long as ol' Bushie is keeping money away from any group that talks about abortion, it'll just hurt the whole sex education process. And don't give me that "We shouldn't be teaching it anyway." That's bull. Kids will have sex. It happens. Look at how many people on this board said they gave it up before they were born again. And as long as procreating is human nature, kids will continue to have sex. So we should just accept that and educate them about it. (The same argument goes for abortions: Women will have them, whether the education and clean, sterile environments are there or not. So instead of killing a bunch of women in back alleys with coat hangers, why don't we help them with something they are going to do anyway?)  -Melissa

      My bills are annoying me today. You know why? Because there are a ton of books out there right now that I can't buy, and there is no way our rinky-dink library will get them in the next decade or so. Here's a list if anyone is interested in contributing to charity :-) Or getting something for Shane and I's wedding (21 days!). Or if you own any of them and want to let me borrow, I'm sure I have something I can loan you in return.   urlLink Dancing Barefoot by Wil Wheaton  Yes, that Wil Wheaton. I've been reading his blog for awhile, and he's not a bad writer. Want to check out his book as soon as the wedding is over and I have money and time to devote to it.   urlLink Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions by Ben Mezrich  Read the excerpt at this link. It's awesome (as in, I am in awe). Want to read. Now. :-)   urlLink The new Harry Potter book.  Geek, I know. But I read the first one out of curiosity and got hooked. And it's coming out on my wedding day. How dare JK Rowling not ask me before deciding her release date? :-)   urlLink Humans by Robert Sawyer  I just read "Hominids" by this author, and this is some of the best researched stuff I have read yet in that whole anthropological, ancient history genre (I don't know what it's called ... think Clan of the Cave Bear or Piers Anthony's geodyssey series) that still manages a great plot. It mixes it up with science fiction, and it had some awesome discussion of religion and history and its interpretations. And it left it with kind of a cliffhanger, so I need to read "Humans" real soon. Or I may die.   OK. No more letting random people see my geek quotient. I read other things. Sometimes. Like "Salt: A World History" right now. *pause* That doesn't really help.

       urlLink This guy  at  urlLink alternet.org  hits it right on the head: I feel guilty about shopping at Wal-Mart. It's a horrible place that treats its employees like crap (check out " urlLink Nickle and Dimed " by Barbara Ehrenreich), puts small businesses out of operation with its practice of putting two Wal-Marts close to each other, and probably gets a ton of stuff from foreign factories that pay workers zilch.   But it's so damn cheap. And it has everything. And then some.  And for a poor newspaperwomen like myself (who is marrying a teacher in three weeks!), the temptation of all the savings is too much sometimes. I can't turn away. As much as I would like to support the cute little record shop down the road, the mom and pop fruit stand a few miles away and other various little guys, I can't afford to do it. And it pisses me off. It makes me feel guilty and beat myself up, but there's not too much I can do about any of it. It's hard enough to boycott  urlLink certain brands . (Nestle is the top one on my list of ones to avoid: urlLink here's why .)   If anyone has a solution for this, please let me know. I would love to hear of a way to smite Wal-Mart, but I suppose that's too much to ask. And if this page isn't here next time you visit, call the Waltons. They might have a good idea.

      From News of the Weird: "Prominent Columbia, S.C., surgeon Harry J. Metropol, appearing before a state legislative committee in April to argue that doctors shouldn't have to pay so much money in malpractice awards and insurance premiums, minimized the harm suffered by a woman (not Metropol's patient) who lost both breasts because of an error in cancer diagnosis. "She did not lose her life," Metropol said, sunnily, "and with plastic surgery, she'll have breast reconstruction better than she did before. It won't be National Geographic, hanging to her knees. It'll be nice, firm breasts."  Yeah, and I bet he'd be saying the same thing if two of his dangly parts got lopped off by accident. (Don't e-mail and tell me  urlLink ball implants  aren't possible.

      I've never heard this song, but I looked up the lyrics after seeing it referenced in the  urlLink Salon  article,  urlLink "Chicks against the Machine."  They say so much about how I feel about this past war, and any  urlLink future wars  we may start ( urlLink Google  Iran in the news if you don't know what I am talking about). Johnny Cash wrote it about Vietnam.  "So we sadly sang for them our last song, And reluctantly we said: "So long." We did our best to let 'em know that we care, For every last one of 'em that's over there. Whether we belong over there or not. Somebody over here love's 'em, and needs 'em  Well now that's about all that there is to tell, About that little trip into livin' hell. And if I ever go back over there any more, I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for; I hope that war is over with,  And they all come back home, To stay.  In peace."  You can care about the troops and hate the war. I wish more anti- anti-war people realized that.

      More news from the Bush-is-a-goober archives. The Bush administration has proposed exemptions for the Department of Defense that will allow continued use of the Navy’s new low frequency sonar that can kill marine mammals by shattering their eardrums.  Because it's not enough that we kill marine animals with oil spills and overfishing. Now we have to torture them to death as well.

      In a story on  urlLink Salon , it has been confirmed that there is a list of 1,000 names of people not allowed to fly for any reason, compiled by different federal agencies. But others are being delayed and harassed at security checkpoints, missing flights and costing money, leading some to believe that there is another list of people who should be closely examined before boarding planes. Among these people are nuns, peace activists and left-wing individuals. What's scarier:  "Inevitably, such questions about how one gets on a federal transit list creates questions about how to get off it. It is a classic -- and unnerving -- Catch-22: Because the Transportation Security Administration says it compiles the list from names provided by other agencies, it has no procedure for correcting a problem. Aggrieved parties would have to go to the agency that first reported their names, but for security reasons, the TSA won't disclose which agency put someone on the list.   Bresson, the FBI spokesperson, would not explain the criteria for classifying someone as a threat to aviation, but suggests that fliers who believe they're on the list improperly should "report to airport security and they should be able to contact the TSA or us and get it cleared up." He concedes that might mean missed flights or other inconveniences. His explanation: "Airline security has gotten very complicated."   So once you are on the list, there may or may not be a way to get off the list; in any case, you are out any money you may have spent on a ticket, not to mention valuable hours of your life. How scarily Kafka-esque is that? Just one more of those civil liberties disappearing under this administration that no one is really missing, and won't, until it's too late.

Virgin even hopes to extend its frequent-flier program, offering extra perks to dogs and cats who earn their wings. “There’ll be special ‘Bone-us Miles’ for the dogs and a ‘Frequent Feline’ club for the cats,” Branson said in his statement."  Am I the only one who thinks calling a program "Bone-us" is a bad idea?

      George Mason University urlLink   has become the second Virginia college  urlLink to stop dispensing an emergency contraceptive  to students after receiving criticism from a conservative state legislator. The first was  urlLink James Madison . A March letter written by Del. Robert G. Marshall, R-Prince William, to George Mason and several other state-supported schools is what caused all this. His position is that these pills are akin to abortion. You know what? Whether they amount to abortion, not letting students have "morning-after" pills isn't going to make them stop having sex. It's not going to make them more careful. It's going to make it more difficult for young girls who aren't ready to have children, whether it's in an emotional, financial or physical sense.   Do these right-wing men even stop to think about this?   They can preach abstinence all they want, but it doesn't make a difference if a girl is raped or silly enough to get drunk and sleep with a guy (which is just another form of rape if the guy is sober and knows she is drunk, IMHO). No girl should have to bear a child because of rape, and in some cases, going to your college pharmacy is a lot easier (and more anonymous) than going to a doctor if you are ashamed of what happened (I know you shouldn't be ashamed ... but try telling some of my friends that who haven't gone to the cops to this day). And it's worth it to me to let a few girls get away without any consequences for the fun they had the night before if it helps out a girl who has been forced into the act.  Not to mention that in the end, it's always the girl who has to deal with any unwanted pregnancy. The guy doesn't have to waddle about for 9 months, nor does he have to be a part of that child's life if he doesn't want to. So until this changes and men start bearing kids, I don't really think it is their business what a woman does with her body. End of story.  Tons of students on these campuses have protested this action, but in this swath of Virginia, that makes very little difference to the conservative parties involved. I'm always amazed at their audaciousness when it comes to governing other people's morals. I know, they say they are protecting the potential life inside a woman, but when you start placing that potential fetus above a woman's rights, you make her into nothing more than a vessel for that potential. And the longer the conservatives are in power, the closer we inch to a society straight out of  urlLink "A Handmaid's Tale."

"Austin Ruse of the Catholic Family & Human Rights Institute reports that Poul Nielson, European Commissioner for Overseas Development and Humanitarian Aid, has come out against what he describes as a "small group of extremists. "The US anti-choice groups are powerful, well-funded and determined. They hold extreme views on religion and sexuality," Nielson complained."

      Re: post from 5.17.03  So it comes out that it wasn't all rumor.  In urlLink  Salon , a  urlLink story  states:  "Ever since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, reports have circulated that the U.S. airline security apparatus is targeting political activists for strict scrutiny and special searches, sometimes forcing them to miss flights. Despite the accounts of peace activists, civil liberties lawyers and left-wing journalists, federal agencies wouldn't confirm the policy and airline officials wouldn't discuss it, and so the stories had the feel of urban legend.   "But in documents released this week in a federal court case in San Francisco, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) confirmed for the first time that it keeps not just a list of potential terrorists barred from the air, but also a list of "selectees" who are subject to strict security checks before they're allowed to board commercial aircraft. The agency has revealed almost nothing else about the selectee list, and is fighting in court to keep secret the names of people who are on it and the standards for putting them there."  Now I'll know for sure the reason why if I get hassled the next time I fly. Civil liberties? Don't be silly. That's so unpatriotic these days!

      Sometimes someone or something else trumps Bush in the news as doing something stupid, ill-thought-out or selfishly stupid. Today, it's Wal-Mart.  Last year, the Grove area of James City County was awarded an enterprise zone. If you are not aware of this concept, let me clue you in: An enterprise zone is an opportunity to dangle tax breaks in front of businesses, a way to spur commercial and industrial development in the county while bringing good paying jobs to residents. In JCC, there are two kinds of local incentives in its enterprise zone: The first is when the business makes a capital investment of $1 million or more, and the second is a job-creation incentive, where, among other things, 50 percent of the jobs must go to residents of the county.  So far, so good. Especially in an area like Grove, where the jobless rate is typically twice as high as in the surrounding county, where the average income is $13,475. (I would have paid more for college in a semester without my scholarship!) Good policy to bring local jobs.   Enter Wal-Mart.  Well-known for not paying much and not offering as many full-time positions as it could, Wal-Mart snapped up some of the primo land and some of the tax breaks offered for its mammoth distribution center. Funny thing is, it's not applying for the local-job incentive. Reason? Not only must 50 percent of the jobs go to locals, the average salary you pay must be $26,000. At this Wal-Mart center, salaries range from $18,000 to $26,000. No chance of that averaging out.  And I wouldn't even have a problem with Wal-Mart moving in an offering low-paying, part-time jobs because, well, they are jobs. But for them to come in and snatch up a piece of this enterprise zone, a zone the county got in hopes of bettering the jobs offered to their locals, that's just wrong. There is plenty of undeveloped land in JCC and the Williamsburg area they could take, letting some business get the tax breaks that would actually try to offer a better class of jobs to residents.   Some people would just say this is good business, that Wal-Mart is just eyeing the bottom line. Unfortunately, that's true. It perfectly befits everything I have ever heard about how it operates. But it's selfish as hell and against all that American pride crap on the Wal-Mart banners you are always seeing.   I guess billions in profits makes it easy to sleep at night.

      This is cool. Got this e-mail from  urlLink The Poison Kitchen Web site  administrators ... if you are a journalist, you should check it out. It's still growing, but it's a good place to get advice, ask questions, debate, etc. Apparently someone out there is reading and agreeing with me.  "Hello sea0tter12,  Just checked out your blog and it's hilarious and interesting and lets me know who the hell is annoying me today as well. Good stuff, keep it up."  As for another cool site I found surfing recently,  urlLink Testy Copy Editors  is funny as hell. In the forum, a bunch of copy editors publish the mistake of the day and gripe about reporters, their bosses and life in general.

      So who's annoying me today? People who think they are better or know more because they have money or the ability to speak another language or any other number of things that would differentiate them from someone else. Over on the  urlLink Spruce Creek High School alumni board , there's a guy who has taken it upon himself to rant about my views and correct what he views as my misconceptions. And a good debate is never something I back away from, as those of you who know me know very well. However, it's the forum he has chosen that irks me.   Here's the deal: I posted on the site letting people know that I got married and have a new last name, etc. Perfectly innocent post. The site administrator allows us to link to a site from our post, so I linked here, thinking people who know me and care enough to read the post might be curious about my Web site. Apparently this guy read my post and clicked on the link, and the things I say here irked him so much, he felt the need to bash me on that forum. Now, I ask you, what is the purpose in that? I provide a way to respond right here on the site. The only thing I can think might be his purpose is just to let people know how smart, successful, etc., he may or may not be while bashing me. How else is he going to mention for the hundredth time that he is worth tons of money, knows another language, is wildly successful, whatever, without sounding like a pompous ass? If that's not the reason, what is? If anyone else can think of a good reason, I would love to know it. Otherwise, someone should clue him in to the fact that he's not the only one in the U.S. with money, he's not the only one who can speak another language (He hablado una lengua otra por muchos anos, y no es dificil - insert tildas and accents where you will, my computer won't do it for me.) and he's not the only one who is successful in a given field.   And just because he is doesn't mean he can attack other people. OK, I shouldn't use the word can. He can do whatever he wants. It just makes him an ass.   Not to mention that some of his posts were personal attacks, which never make for good debate.   Now, his vile posts have been removed, but some of his cronies (or him posing as his friends) are pissed that my initial post has not been removed because it contains the link to this site, which they don't like. They are continuing to post attacks, and they are still being unnecessarily personal in their gripes. And they are missing one key point: My post says that I got married. In order to read that information, you don't need to click on this link. It's all a matter of the proper time and place to post your views. This is proper. That site isn't.  And if any of you are reading this site and are still not happy, by all means, pick the proper place to respond. Right here, where it belongs. Don't take it over to a site that, until you came around, was a great place to be.

      Sorry for the lag in posting. I was on my honeymoon, so I have an excuse :-)   But, in the meantime ...  The Bushies are at it again. Now they are trying to take overtime pay away from nearly 8 million workers. The House has voted to allow these changes to go through, and it's only a matter of time, I suppose, until the Senate does the same.   Under the  urlLink new rules,  anyone who is a "learned professional" can be exempt. This is someone who has special skills needed for their job, or basically anything that can be considered a vocation. Well, there goes any OT I'll be getting as a copy editor. It's going to affect a lot of middle management and people like me, who aren't too far up on the chain, but who have to know a little something to get where we are. Sigh. According to  urlLink a column  by Bob Herbert of the NY Times, "nearly 80 percent of all workers are in jobs that qualify them for overtime pay, which is time-and-a-half for each hour that is worked beyond the normal 40-hour week."  The Labor Department is estimating that only 600,000 or so workers are going to be affected, but read  urlLink the definitions  yourself. They are so vague and ill-defined, any business who wants to save money could make the case for their workers fitting into the new categories.   The part of this that I can't understand is why more newspapers and TV stations aren't splashing this all over the front page, giving it the same play as Laci Peterson or OJ. Not only does it affect a lot of readers, it affects a lot of us who put the paper out every day. And for some of us, OT is not an option, it's a way to make ends meet, especially when you have a spouse out of work (as I used to when he first moved up) or kids to support or heat to turn on in the winter.   I'm scared. I really am. Because with each new policy Bush and his cronies put into place, the further America sinks into a pit of depression. I'm looking at having kids in a few years, buying a house, a new car, but if this continues, I don't know how we could afford it. I don't know how any middle working class person could afford it. Not even mentioning in this rant the policies that won't affect my children financially that they are trying to get into place (abortion, civil rights, social security, health care, etc.).   I'm at a loss right now. I don't know when I have ever been more depressed about living in this country or more pessimistic. I just got married. The world should seem rife with possibilities. But outside of my own personal circle, made up of Shane and I, I'm not really seeing them. And that is truly depressing.

      From an  urlLink AP story:  "President Bush has said he supports efforts to legally ban gay marriage, but encourages tolerance of gays and lesbians."  Yeah, because the two go together so well.  What's even scarier is the results of the poll in the story. More Americans are against gay marriages and civil unions than 3 years ago. However, in the scariness, we can find humor:   From the article: "I don't think it's a great idea, the whole idea of marriage is bringing up children," said Jim Martin, a 64-year-old engineer from Alexandria, Va. "If somebody was promoting it, I would vote against them."  If the whole idea of marriage is bringing up children, then I know about 15 couples in my immediate sphere of influence that should never have gotten married. Heterosexual couples. They never wanted children, they've never had children, and they'll never have children. According to this guy's thinking, they should have never gotten married.   So now that this excuse not to let gays marry falls apart due to, go figure,  logic,  it's back to the drawing board. Of course, there's always old reliable: The Bible. And everyone knows that should be the final word on law in the U.S. *insert sarcasm here*

      Bush wants to shrink the number of military vets who qualify for disability in order to pay for concurrent payments of disability and retirement benefits. Which is so wrong.   urlLink From AP:   "Under current law, disabled veterans eligible for military retirement pay have their retirement reduced by the amount they receive in disability payments. Veterans groups argue that civilian federal employees on disability get full retirement benefits, and lawmakers for years have tried to extend that right to veterans.  "The problem is cost: estimates are that full “concurrent receipt” of both benefits would cost $58 billion over 10 years."  Yet Bush has the nerve  urlLink to ask for $87 billion for Iraq  next year. Screw the future veterans fighting over there and give Iraq lots of money. Compared to this, $58 billion over 10 years is nothing. He really needs to get a grip.

      Editing the oped page, I recently read a wonderful column by Ellen Goodman, a Boston Globe columnist. It's about the two decisions made recently by the Bush boys;  urlLink one about abortion , the other  urlLink about the right to die . I think she nails the issue on the head.   "It is deeply troubling moment when a stranger, a governor, a legislator, a president is given the power to write the end of our ethical, medical, family tales. Yes, this is how we lose our freedoms: One signature at a time."   urlLink Ellen Goodman: Signing away our freedoms   I think we all have to be vigilant, now more so than ever. So many in this country are complacent and allow our rights to be signed away, one by one, and one day they are going to look up and we won't be living in the America of our forefathers any more. Sept. 11 started the push with Ashcroft, and now we have one Bush who would be King and another who would be God. It's a consolation that ole Jeb will be out of office in a couple of years, never to return. One can only hope that the same will happen with Dubya in the coming election.

      Poetic justice:  Hurricane Isabel roared through Virginia Beach, Va., in September, inflicting serious property damage, despite public calls for prayer to keep it away by prominent resident Rev. Pat Robertson, whose Christian Broadcasting Network is headquartered there. (In 1998, Robertson condemned the city of Orlando, Fla., for sponsoring a Gay Days festival, and warned that the city could be torn up during the subsequent hurricane season, as God punishes those who promote homosexuality. Instead, the first hurricane of that season (Bonnie) made a direct hit on Virginia Beach.)    -From  urlLink News of the Weird

      This is a personal issue, but you know who else is annoying me today? Landlords. Our one up in Virginia won't let us out of our lease, even though we moved all the way down here to Greensboro, NC. OK, so maybe I understand that, a bit. But I would be a heck of a lot more understanding if they were actually bothering to publish an ad in the paper trying to find someone to rent it to. (Did they think I wouldn't check?)  But what really irritates me most is how they are acting about out $1,340 deposit. Here is an e-mail my husband sent me from Virginia when he was tying up loose ends up there:  "Well, the woman we dealt with before showed up with another associate from Greg Garrett to do the final walk-through a little after 2 o'clock.  They brought with them a tubular device, which at one end had a handle with an embedded red light and at the other end two prongs.  In every room in the townhouse, they pressed the two prongs into the carpet in an attempt to detect urine, which they claimed that this device could do.  Furthermore, they claimed that they could smell the cat urine, which I doubt, given that the pest control man had sprayed the apartment only two hours before they arrived.  In any case, the ladies claimed that the urine smell was especially bad in the guest room.  I asked to see the device in action, and one of the two ladies went upstairs with me to demonstrate it.  Despite repeatedly pressing the device into the carpet, the best she could manage was a faint blip on the device which I did not see, and the blip lasted no more than a fraction of a second, if it did indeed detect something.  Further attempts to rediscover the spot that had produced the blip failed to yield any results.  Both ladies thought that the device's batteries were going dead, or might have been thrown off by the chemicals used to clean the apartment, and they generally did their best to make it sound as thought the lack of any results was due to some fault in the machine rather than a lack of urine.  They have assured me that they intend to return on Monday with another one of these devices to test the carpet again.  The ladies informed me that if it is not possible to remove the alleged cat urine smell, they may have to re-carpet the area, thought exactly what area they were referring to they did not say.  I assume it is limited to the guest room, but there is just no way to know.  Clearly this would all be coming out of our deposit.  I did give them the keys, but I have signed no paperwork, and they did not ask me to.  I am uncomfortable about not being present when they retest on Monday, and I have a feeling this could get ugly before it's over if they "find" the urine. :-("  A urine detector? Try a bullshit detector. There is no way those women smelled anything; they have been like this since they came over to inspect the place after Isabel came thru. We still had boxes all over the place (we were planning to move soon and didn't want to unpack), there was laundry in the hallway (a week without power will do that to a person), there were dishes all over the kitchen (again, water you have to boil and no power for a week?), and she just didn't like the disorganized life that we live. Like it's any of her business. They have been trying to get us since then, and they can't because they have no justifiable reason to. Sigh. I hate them and wish this whole mess were over with so we could go on with our lives (and our money).

      Now, I'm totally against racism in any form. But  urlLink some people  really take it too far by finding racist intent in the most innocent of sources.   When I was a child, when you were picking someone for a game or trying to decide which flavor of ice cream you wanted, there was a simple rhyme you could use:  "Eenie, meenie, minie, mo Catch a tiger by the toe If he hollers, let him go Eenie, meenie, minie mo."  Totally innocent. I had no idea its origins were from a much less enlightened time. And I bet a lot of people didn't know either, including one unfortunate airline stewardess.  Trying to get her passengers to sit down, she (trying to be humorous as her company suggests) said over the intercom, "Eenie, meenie, minie, moe; pick a seat, we gotta go."  The flight attendant's words upset two black passengers because, apparently, the rhyme has a racist history. The two passengers, sisters Louise Sawyer and Grace Fuller, insist this woman did this to hurt them and are demanding damages and pain and suffering and lots of money from the airline (Luckily, a jury told them they were SOL.).  The original nursery rhyme goes like this: " Eenie, meenie, minie, moe;  catch a n----- by his toe."  Did you know that? I sure as heck didn't. And I still use the children's rhyme I learned.  You know, there are a lot of nursery rhymes that we learn in all innocence as children that have much darker meanings. "Ring around the rosies"?  urlLink Bubonic plague . Humpty Dumpty?  urlLink It was a big ole cannon in England  used to kill people (in defense, of course). Check out  urlLink this site  if you want to learn more.  Anyway, my point is, I bet hardly anyone knows that "Eenie, meenie, minie, moe" used to be a really bad rhyme at one time. But it has evolved into a simple children's rhyme, so let it be. You aren't going to get kids to stop saying it, which means a lot of adults are going to know it as well ... even if they don't know its origins. And they don't mean a thing by it.

      Just a quick news update for those who care: Someone is moving into the townhouse in Va., and the landlord said they would be sending a check soon for our deposit. We're crossing our fingers that we are getting the whole thing back.  Now that I have fewer worries such as moving and money on my mind, I hope to get back to blogging on a regular basis. And there is so much going on in the world right now that annoys me!  1.  urlLink Bush and his military record . I wish this had all come out a long time ago. Which leads to ...  2. Democrats and Republicans who save up all their charges for election time, hoping to confuse the actual issues. Democrats have known about the Bush military thing for a while, at least since Molly Ivins published "Shrub" (which is when I found out). Why bring it up now? As for the Republicans, this whole  urlLink John Kerry intern thing  is rubbish, too. Have an actual debate for once. If you'd like to see which candidate you'd support, take  urlLink this quiz . I agree on the issues with Kerry, Kucinich, and Al Sharpton. Only an 11 percent match with Bush. That didn't really surprise me.  3. The conservatives who are still trying to prevent same-sex marriages. I think what they are  urlLink doing in San Francisco this weekend  is wonderful, and I wish the couples a long and happy marriage. Much more to come on this subject in the days to come, especially as the conservative groups go to court Tuesday.  4. The WB. I just found out they  urlLink canceled "Angel."  Now what will I do without any of the Buffyverse from Joss?

      Comletely random thought I had while watching the  urlLink Independent Spirit Awards .  urlLink John Waters  said something about, the next time you pay $7.50 to watch a movie and you get a commercial, boo!   I paraphrase, but what I gathered is he doesn't like movies that seem like big commercials (perhaps he was talking about " urlLink The Italian Job's " advertisement for the  urlLink Mini Cooper ?).  That's what my husband heard, anyway. The thought that flashed in my mind when he talked was that the next time you pay for a movie and have to watch a commercial beforehand, you should boo. And I totally agree. You know, on the Internet, you have pop-ups and ads you have to look at before you get to content, but that's OK. And you know why?  It's free . When it's not free, there usually aren't any ads.  It should be the same way when you go to the theatre. If you pay $5-$10 for a movie ticket, you shouldn't have to watch a guy rope a car to advertise his brand of jeans. You shouldn't have to see the latest car on the road or the coolest cell phone on your movie screen.   I wouldn't complain if the new trend to show commercials once only seen on TV resulted in lower ticket prices. But it doesn't. In fact, right before I left Virginia, ticket prices at our theatre went up 50 cents. When I was in high school (only six years ago), tickets were only $4 or so. Now, $7 and more is common. Why do they get to jack up the prices on tickets  and  make money on commercials?  Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with movie trailers. I love movie trailers, and they have been a part of the movie-going experience as long as I can remember. But I have to see ads for cars and jeans and phones on TV all the time. Don't make me watch them on the movie screen as well.

      There are just so many things wrong with  urlLink this proposal  to make women a part of the military draft and to raise the age to 34. First of all, what it tells me is that the draft is a very real possibility. I keep reading all these articles about how men and women are having to stay in Iraq well past their tours of duty and how there aren't enough people to do what we need to do over there. And that sucks so much. People like my brother and my husband could be drafted to fight a battle they want no part of. I've never believed there was a reason for going over there. Now that we are there and have messed everything up, there's no way we can consciably leave. So we have to keep sending fodder over there for the snipers and guerrillas to hunt. And with a draft, that fodder could end up being my husband or brother, or if this resolution is passed, it could be me.  Not to mention, are they going to make allowances in this proposal for what could happen? What is done if a husband and wife are both drafted? Will one get to stay home with the kids? Which one? Do the parents get to decide, or will the government step in according to the "special skills" mentioned later in the article?  I almost hope they try to draft me. I would love to burn my draft card or move to France. I've already got one cousin over there. There is no way I or the rest of my family is going over there.  This doesn't really have a through-line of reasoning, and for that I apologize. This just bothers me so much my fingers type before my brain has time to sort it out into neat paragraphs and sentences. I hope to all that is holy that Bush is out of the White House next January, even if it is Kerry that has to take his place.

      The  urlLink Sims 2  will be release Sept. 17!!!  Of course, this means we are going to be spending a buttload of money in the fall. Other things coming out in September and October on the must-have list:  -- Angel, the complete 4th season -- Smallville, 3rd season (rumors) -- Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas -- 21 Jump Street, the 1st season  Not to mention the DVDs we don't have yet, such as Star Trek:TNG 7 season and Buffy season 6. And all the movies coming out between here and there, as well. Sigh. We are pop-culture and mass-media whores.

      Great joke from  urlLink Burning Bush :  Robot Bartender  A popular bar had a new robotic bartender installed. A fellow came in for a drink and the robot asked him, "What's your IQ?" The man replied, "150."   So the robot proceeded to make conversation about Quantum physics, string theory, atomic chemistry, and so on. The man listened intently and thought, "This is really cool."  The man decided to test the robot. He walked out of the bar, turned around, and came back in for another drink.   Again, the robot asked him, "What's your IQ?" The man responded, "100." So the robot started talking about football, baseball, and so on. The man thought to himself, "Wow, this is really cool."   The man went out and came back in a third time. As before, the robot asked him, "What's your IQ?" The man replied, "50."   The robot then said, "So, you gonna vote for Bush again?"

      So  urlLink Raplph Nader won't be getting the Green Party nomination  despite choosing a Green Party running mate, and therefore won't be getting  urlLink the automatic by onto the ballot in 22 states  where the Green Party gets a pick. I hope this means he will miss the deadline, number of signatures, etc. to get on the ballot in those states  urlLink as well , keeping him out of much of the race. Doesn't it tell you something when the  urlLink Republicans are helping  you out?

      Here's a  urlLink fun political site  a friend clued me in to a few weeks ago. Wonkette is very liberal, so all of you odd conservative people should proceed at your own risk.   Fark.com -- I adore this site. Check it out, and you'll see why.  Worth1000.com --If you're interested in Photoshop, this is the site to be. Tutorials, contests, etc. Just fun to look through, if nothing else.

      Songs that didn't make  urlLink the list  that bugged me:   Take My Breath Away, Top Gun  Pretty Woman, Pretty Woman  Anything from Blues Brothers  Anything from Ferris Bueller  Ghostbusters  Blame Canada, South Park  I Will Always Love You, Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (they mentioned both movies when some songs were listed ... why not when they listed this song for Bodyguard?)  Anything from Willy Wonka What a Wonderful World, Good Morning Vietnam Somewhere Out There, American Tail  I think they should have picked one song from each film that represented that film best ... I mean, I adore West Side Story, but it took up like 5 or 6 songs, and Sound of Music and a couple others had more than one. That way, they could have had more movies represented.   Anyway, here's  urlLink the list  of the 400 songs orginally nominated. A lot of my picks are on there, but some still aren't. Humph.  Of course, I also noticed that  urlLink Heathers  wasn't mentioned for Que Sera, Sera, nor was Working on the Chain Gang for  urlLink Cadence  (two films for which I have an unreasonable amount of liking).

      I don't know if this works or not, but I'm gonna try it. If you sign up for one of their offers (one of them is to sign up with eBay or AOL, and some others), and get five friends to sign up as well, then you can get a free 20 GB iPod, or $250 from iTunes. I'm going for the iTunes, personally. Anyway, some people over at the Kevin Smith board have a chain going to sign up with each other as a referral ... I'm cheating a bit and posting  urlLink my referral link   here as well:  urlLink http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=7513196  You can cancel your offer sign-up immediately if you like :-) Sign up and use this link! I'll post again if it doesn't work and annoys me :-)

      I saw a sign recently advertising a product that guaranteed it would make me "fill better." What exactly does that mean? &nbsp; I can't stand advertising that has bad grammar, misspellings, or any sort of mistakes. You get a limited number of words as it is to get your point across; at least make sure they are right. &nbsp; Driving down I-95 a few months ago, I saw one of those "South of the Border" huge billboards. I'm glad to know that "Bus'es are welcome." &nbsp; We went to see Dolly's  urlLink "Dixie Stampede"  show in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., recently. The brochure for this show, one that is sold out nearly every night and makes tons of money, told us it was Pigeon Forges Greatest Dinner Show. You would think someone out there would understand possessives. Did they not have a copy editor? &nbsp; Maybe I'm too anal about these things, since I  am  a copy editor, but it really bugs me to see things like this. Especially when those&nbsp;editors&nbsp;are probably getting paid a hell of a lot more working in advertising than I am.

      OK, so I'm just urging everyone to get out there and vote. I have a feeling that the way the country is run would be a lot different if 100 percent of Americans voted, but the only way to find out is to make that happen. Of course, I'm of the opinion that the Internet would go a long way to making that happen -- I know a ton of young people would vote if they could just click something online. Of course, that means tons of security issues, but I don't see how it would be much different than the mess they have down in Florida, so who knows? I'm not telling you how to vote, I'm just letting you know that you should. "You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything."

      Before the 2001 inauguration of George Bush, he was invited to a get acquainted tour of the White House. After drinking several glasses of iced tea, he asked Bill Clinton if he could use his personal bathroom. When he entered Clinton's private toilet, he was astonished to see that President Clinton had a solid gold urinal.  That afternoon, George told his wife, Laura, about the urinal. "Just think," he said, "when I am president, I could have a gold urinal too. But I wouldn't do something that self-indulgent!"  Later when Laura had lunch with Hillary at her tour of the White House, she told Hillary how impressed George had been at his discovery of the fact that, in the President's private bathroom, the President had a gold urinal.  That evening, when Bill and Hillary were getting ready for bed, Hillary smiled, and said to Bill, "I found out who pissed in your saxophone."

      At least some of them. Shane, who has been having physical therapy for a while to be able to move his finger, had an appointment yesterday. Shane was planning to ask the doctor if he could stop going to the $40-per-week appointments, for two reasons: 1.) His finger is a lot better, and it just needs for him to work on it now to get all the way better. 2.) We are poor. But Shane expected the normal appointment, the kind where he doesn't get back home for almost 2 hours.  Get this: The doctor doesn't even spend thirty seconds with him. He basically tells my sweetie he's good to go and doesn't need any more office visits. Great. What's not great is that for what that doctor could have done over the phone, he charged us $20. That sickens me.  I have another friend who told me a story about a pregnant woman who was in labor, ably attended to by a gaggle of nurses and doctors. A doctor she had never met (the head doctor, I believe) stuck his head in and asked if she needed his help. She told him no, she was fine with the staff she had. She remembered his name, and later, when she saw the itemized bill, his name was listed with a consultation fee of $500. That's not a typo.   When I went to get a root canal and crown while I was in college, I had no dental insurance. While discussing with the person how much it would be, I about had a heart attack. She quoted a price that was very close to $1,000, an amount that's inconceivable to a broke college student. When she found out I didn't have insurance, she said it would only be $600. Still expensive, but not quite as bad. I find out later it's common practive to charge more when insurance is paying for it.  And people wonder why health-care coverage costs so much.

      In his memoirs, "A World Transformed," written five years ago, George Bush Sr. wrote the following to explain why he didn't go after Saddam Hussein at the end of the Gulf War.   "Trying to eliminate Saddam...would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq.... There was no viable "exit strategy" we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations'mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."

      As the Web site  urlLink FactCheck.org  quotes, "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts." (From Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan)  This is a nonpartisan Web site that I urge everyone to check out. It takes a look at both sides' political ads and fact checks them, pointing out what is wrong in each. Just a way for you to see how everyone tries to politically manipulate the mind of the people. Notice, as you scroll through  urlLink all of them , how many are for Kerry vs. Bush. I think you'll see just what Bush has been doing with those millions he's been using in this campaign.

      Just in the interest of full disclosure, I am a native Floridian, and I lived there for 18-21 years, depending on whether you count college. I still think Florida is messed up, and there is so much potential for more wrongness to happen in the election in November, as evidenced by  urlLink this article :   July 3, 2004  |  MIAMI -- More than 2,100 Floridians who had their voting rights restored were included on a list of purported felons who are potentially ineligible to vote, a newspaper reported Friday.   The names were on a Florida Division of Elections list of more than 47,000 people that was sent to county elections supervisors, who are expected to determine who should be removed from the rolls.   The Miami Herald, after a computer analysis, said at least 2,119 people on the list had received clemency and were eligible to vote.    So people who aren't eligible to vote (i.e. dead people) do manage to vote, and people who  are  allowed to vote, can't.
