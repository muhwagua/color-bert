      Msn doesn't work. It's official. It doesn't like my computer! Hehe, I took the bus to piano so I didn't have to walk! Heeehee! Oh and Laura went in the wrong room (!) (stupid Laura!) she walked round like a complete idiot for a bit and I stood outside thinking like a complete idiot. My tiny little brain couldn't cope with the fact that stupendously clever Laura had walked into the wrong room. Either that or it was trying to think that I had and that would be even more confusing. So I dragged her out and about 3 hours later she was still babbling on about it! She seems to have a thing about that (a very stupid thing, but still, it's Laura's thing!) Oh and I got home by car so I didn't walk home :( I'm sorry! Wow, what a boring day! Oh and every one thinks we're hippies...yep...they're weird. My kittens don't seem to like the rain! They like to stay indoors which is really very clever because Scamp used to go outside anyway. Oh and Brodie's official count for falling in the pond is now: 2. Keep you updated on that every day because stupid Brodie falls in about every day! Oh and aww! We have pictures of them! I might be able to put some html in and take a picture of them and put it on this! (Wow, she's actually that clever?!) Nope, but I like you to think that I am! :) Is it me or am I just talking to myself...yup and Izzy isn't even listening. AM I ALONE? HELOO?

      Hmm well my brothers going in the loft now...and I'm thinking about locking it! (Hehe!) By the sounds of it, he has a friend round. Hmm, by the sounds of it? That's weird! Any way, about walking home! :O Well these funny old parents were talking about how our school (the comp (for you nonknowing people, the comprehensive)) pupils were walking across their school! (Hehe) But it's our field...I guess I could go round if I really could be bothered. (Yup, I had a really boring day!)

      Mmm well the smoothies smelt like cow pat's and to Laura it tasted like that. But Laura doesn't like straw berries so Izzy and my taste buds aren't that bad. We put green flavouring in and swizzed it in a liquidizer! Mmm...different!  What you need to make a gross drink!  A pack of straw berries (the things you get in fruit and veg shops...in England this is) Two bananas Horrible tinned pinapple chunks (can't remember spelling) Bit of lemon Lots of orange! Horrible pint of horrible low fat yogurt...go on, use cream ;) Lots of ice...LOTS! Green food colouring  What you do: Throw in all the fruit (remove skins and other horribly nobbly bits) Wizz it a bit, but if you've got Laura with you she'll make you pulse it to nothing. Add in the yogurt and ice. Smush it to oblivion. Add Green food colouring Watch it go brown Smell it Taste it and throw up! (Enjoy)

      Hi. Today's been fun. Oh and if you're wondering, I rampaged home ;) Also I've been informed that admazed is actually amazed (Even though I didn't notice the difference) Hey, I can be admazed if I want to! Oh and my knees hurt. A lot! It seems to hurt walking up and downstairs and bending down, so I've given up bending down and I'm letting Izzy do it for me! Laura (my other friend) has a pain in her knee too! So we walk around like a couple of old lady's; all ways complaining about our knees. The class dork asked Laura out. To my  admazement  (well I've got to find a new way to annoy Izzy) she said no! Hehe, well he was a sexist pig and his ego was about as big as his stupidness (very big). Ahh, tomorrow's Friday and  admazingly  I got invited to a party! Wow! So I'm going to Laura's because my house is here   and it takes me about 40 mins to get waaayyyyy over there! But Emma (the girl's party) is fun! I hope she likes what I got her. Claire (other girl) is a bit too odviously saying 'Oh I have to go at 8 because I have to go to gym. Yes that's right at 8 after the sleep over." Way to rub in that we're not coming. She shoots and she scores! (Right between the eyes on her hopefully) Hehe this is fun! Well I better go and see what the kittens have done now because they're bound to of done something. They're never dull and very  admazing !

      Izzy, what a wondeful story, now I'll post a wonderful poem for every one (no one) to see! Muhahaha! (Oh send all angry comments about how bad it is to Izzy!)  Izzy Bird  Upside down, Inside out, Dancing around, Prancing about, It skips, It sings, It larks about, Give it a prod and you'll hear it shout "Get off! Go far away and there you stay!"  They scream, They slither, All as strange, And weird as each other. They;re red, And blue, And purple, And black. Whatever you do, Don't look back.  By Kes Sims!  Now wasn't that good? (no comment) Wahay! I should become a professional one day oh wait- I am one! Nohohoho!  (Unlike some :P)

      Gather round kids, i'm going to tell you a tale of old...  The story begins on a dark night...  The wind was howling howlingly (howl-howl) in great howling howls, and the owl was hooting (hoot-hoot) like a great hooting...thing. Speaking of things.... there was a thing. It was the thingyest thing in the history of thingy-thing like thingy-things. It moved across the ground as thingyly as a thing... THEN it took from it's pocket.... a thing of things! but this was not just any thing of things.... this thing of things was the thing.... OF THING! (THING is a thingy-type-place in the forbiddon land of the land of thing.) The thing carrying the thing of thing-like-things from thing in the land of thing was... The Izzy-thing!  This Izzy-thing was the most beaytiful, brave, daring, truthful...loyal...friendly...generous thing. The Izzy-thing was on her way to the thingy-type-place called THING in the forbidding land of thing with a thing of thing-like things BECAUSE (this is where it gets interesting honest) she had been commanded by the all-powerful thing to put them in the smelly-toilet of the Evil Katie-Thing (told you) so that they would explode into smelly-thing-like-things and cover the Katie-thing and the THING in the forbidding land of thing in green smelly-thing. AND SHE DID. THE END

      Oh today was fun. I walked home, that was fun...That's the best thing about school, it actually makes you appretiate getting home, away from some people (I'd prefer not to disclose that information :)) The one thing that's in my head when I'm walking home-I need the loo! I all ways do when I'm walking home! I think it's because I never go in the school loo's, yes, that's right! I never ever have been in the school loo's! I never need to go! (Queer girl) Yup :) I walked past a load of horse poo, it's become like a land mark: you're nearly home. The horse has either come back and stood on it or it's been trodden on by thousands of school kids...Hmm I'm betting on the Mum's push chair cot thingys (Well I don't know do I!) Before you get the idea that I'm 3, I'm not, I'm 13! (Wow aint she old?) Not really... Yeah I think I'll try to jazz this up (there is a way!) Something to do with adding a thingy? (Yup, I get it) And something to do with putting a bravenet.com counter thingy on! So we can see how miserably no one views this! (Cause if any one did they'd probably e-mail me to beg me to stop boring them!) Apart from I'll probably press refreshx100 and fix it ;) I bet that's what every one does! Oh sorry, I'm just trying to get the full out of my internet use because my brother's all ways on, yup, I do blab too much! (And what's up with all the yup's???

Does everything I type have to end with a : ! I wonder? Odviously not... I finally kicked my brother off (wooh!) But tomorrow's school :( Not good! Oh and the full-stop button's under the > ;) (Stupid girl) Hey that's been said twise! Oh and have you put a link to this on your webby? Add a link to: http://saneasakitten.blogspot.com although I think that I'm a bit saner than my kittens!

      Well this is new I guess...hmm...Izzy? Guess Izzy's gonna see this...(hehehe) Hmm at the moment I've got my brother blasting away on his guitar...he's recorded it so he can play the trumpet at the same time (Aargh!) Oh and our front door's wide open because my dad just painted the step (any one want to nick a tv?) Yeay! He broke the trumpet...well...our school's trumpet...Oh well. I walked into our kitchen and the kittens started to tear me to shreds! (We have three, and they love to be stroked) They're sooo cute though! When they're not scratching... Mmm I should have breakfast soon! My rabbit's running around our garden. We introduced her to one of our cats called Mango and it tried to bite her neck! So she's still a bit freaked but I guess they're just gonna have to work on their relationship. Our old cat Scamp used to get a bit annoyed by Agoutie (our rabbit) because she used to follow him around all the time! (Aww!) I'm getting kicked off now, guess any one reading this is as confused as me! Cleo, Brodie and Mango are the kittens, Agouties's my rabbit, Scamp and Pixie were our old cats but they passed away :(

      *Yawn* Eugh, so tired! I woke up at half eight today ...don't ask why. I have to go out at about 10:40 though so I can meet people ...zzz. Don't really know if getting up that early is worth it. I missed out on a whole lot of beauty sleep. About the kitchen, we were gonna have liner or whatever on the floor but to do that you had to rip up the old stuff and scree...? And that would cost a bomb. Then the guy showed us some expensive carpet and I was like "Eh, yeah right we're gonna have that." So then he showed us these bits of wood you clip together. Dad was thinking about doing it *shiver* at this rate who needs a new floor? My mum likes this really really bad wallpaper and I like the good one (it's always the way) Hehe, I got my brother on my side. Don't ask me where Izzy is, I think she's disappeared off the side of the Earth. She's neglecting the blog! :O It's awful! Oh my God, the world is ending. Oh my God, the world is nigh. (Stupid song, the less questions asked the better) Oh, my mum keeps going on about this thing in bond. This guy says to M "I don't think you have the balls for this job" and M says "At least I don't have to think with them all the time." Hehe, it has all this really played down weird stuff in it! Cool!

      The people are coming to fit our kitchen today! They're an hour late already. Wow, highs of 11oC in britsol! Some hopw my rabbits back in her hutch, she escaped last night and we couldn't get her back in! Aww, I want Cleo back. :( She's at the cattery with the rest of the monsters because the kitchen's being fitted. Mango would probably get stuck in the fridge or something if they were here! Wow, are they here? Looks like they are! ...they're upstairs? And the kitchens downstairs? Have I missed something? Oh, I might have to go, they're gonna turn the electrics off. :( Back to the ice age I guess. Word of advice ...pink is the colour of the world. Have fun figuring that out!

      Sorry, last blog got cut off. It was because of the guy doing our kitchen, he needed the computer turned off so he could turn off the electrics. So any way what was I saying? Oh, nothing important! All that stuff about foot-and-mouth, I haven't seen any of it. Some people (not saying any thing) were afraid that the country side would be full of it! Well none that I saw was. Hey, the governments paying me well to say this stuff! Hehe, wish it was. My Dad's gone mad on Kelly's ice-cream. Apparently it's from Cornwall and every time its out he likes to tell every one. Hmm. I'm beginning to think that the world hasn't gone mad, I have. Oh yeah forgot to say this all this time, DEATH TO MACDONALD'S! Hey, sue me. Wow! It's ike pitch black and it's only 5:45!

      Hehe I just read an American persons blog, talking about the Yankees or something? My Mum just asked me if I wanted to go out for a walk. I just saw a load of people rolling around in the mud with motor-bikes. I just watched this guy on the news. Made me feel really English and made me laugh. Dunno why though. Hehe, how different we all are, made me realise I guess. As far as I get it, English people have boring lives. Well, I do. Boring and cold! We don't eat cream scones with tea. Infact, I hate tea! Oh, Cornwall's a really tacky place, well actually not a lot of it is. The rest is devoted to walkers, some is devoted to surfers, whatevers left is of course devoted to me. ;) Nah, it's got nice gardens and things. Ok, so on Neighbours some one almost died from drinking alcohol!

      Oh well, blogger lost my last post. :( *sniff sniff* It was a moral rambling one! Hmm, maybe it saw how rubbish it was and decided not to put it on? Brr, my house is like an igloo. Coooold! We've got a guy here fitting electrics in our kitchen. No, we're not stuck in the ice age, he's changing the sockets round to different locations or something... He's making a lot of funny noises though! Guess we'll walk in and have a wall ripped out or some thing. Well maybe that's why my house is cold! Maybe it's me... Maybe it's the fact that the kittens have gone to a kitten hotel for three whole days! Maybe it's the fact that I talk to much. Hmm. Well I finished reading The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. I love that book! It's really good, but now I've got nothing to do... :( Hmm... take over the world? Nah, too old fashioned. Make you want to pull your hair out because of boredom? Now that's living! Why don't I get any interesting e-mails? Maybe it's because I'm so interesting that no e-mail can out-interest me! Maybe it's because I say maybe too much... Maybe it's because I think too much. Ooh fun fun fun! Tonight we're having fish and chips! Mmm, yummy! Sorry, that popped into my head. It's because we're ripping the kitchen out for the new one. The people are coming to fit it tonight! Oh God, sad thought, I've been inside my house for three days. Eugh, I need to get out more. What is there to do in Nailsea? Oh yes, go swimming, freeze to death. Lovely. Go ice-skating freeze to death again, hmm. Cinema? Oh great, go to the Curzon every single time I want to go. The Curzon is one of the oldest Cinema's in the UK or something but I've got there that many times that I'm getting annoyed with it! Mmm I just drank some milk, it was warm and some thing slithered down my throat. Blurgh! I get the feeling my brothers going crazy he wrote 'Just because I have my eyes' on a piece of paper... (Cuckoo!) Well sorry to bore you! Erm... piece of advice... erm... only do what your alphabet soup tells you to!

Cos my birthday is on 21st of December (hint hint) and thats the winter equinox thingy.. yeah.... *proud grin* Hey - someone typed in peanut shells on google search and found our site! I mentioned peanut shells like- once, and it came up on the search! I'm gonna try that! Hi sad person who found us on Google! Why would you search for peanut shells anyway??

      Hey. Eugh I woke up at nine today... yes, it's true. Well every thing's been taken out of our kitchen because the electrical guy was supposed to be coming but I forgot to tell my parents that he's coming on Monday. So I'm hiding in the computer at the moment. They're at the vet though cause Cleo's gotta have her stitches out! Aw, poor little girly! Mango's going a bit mad and he climbed all the way up the curtains! So I'm not the only one whose in trouble. Tired... Oh and the person's coming to fix the kitchen on Tuesday and Wednesday, not Monday and Tuesday so we're in one big pickle over here. Mmm pickles... Hey isn't Wednesday Halloween? Hehe, maybe I can scare the kitchen fitting people! Some one was saying that Halloween was a Christian festival? I don't know about in America but in England isn't it considered a Pagan festival? Hmm what's it about again... erm isn't it about all the bad spirits and things running around at night? Well I'm pretty sure it's not Christian because I am one, my Mum told us it's Pagan and she has a super Christian friend. (She never misses church and always does all the raising money for the church stuff) And she doesn't give out sweets and her kids have never done trick or treating. I did that once. Guess what I was. A ghost! A sheet ghost! They come in the night and... and... nick your sheets! Ooga booga! (I should be an actress!) Oh yeah, they've decided to rip the pews out in our church! Then they've decided to rip out the balcony, rip up the stone floor and do other horrific things to it! Hey, why not just knock it down and build a new church? We got a letter about it and they want us to send them letters. I want to send them angry letters but they only want ones from people over 16. Grrr. That's just annoying. Wow I'm watching car racing... queer huh? Well I can either watch stupid pop people prancing about on channel one and three, this car thing on four or a programme for deaf people on two. Hard choice. Live long and prosper!

      You go girl!!!! I've heard them saying stuff about me before like i'm deaf - it was funny, i just turned around and stared straight at them, they knew that i'd heard. That was funny. It's funny how you can turn something like that into something that makes you laugh by just doing a simple action. They cheated in the french test!!! That reeaaallly pisses me off grr..... they judge people by things like what they wear and what their preferences are, whereas I judge people after knowing them long enough to know that they're self-obsessed, shallow, uncultured, closed-minded, COWS  No offence to cows or anything.

      These people were staring at me in maths. I'm not perfect, I don't pretend to be. They started as I walked out. The bitches. I knew they were saying "Oh my God look at her!" I heard my name, I heard it all. I stomped home. A rare occasion where you actually stomp. I felt like the heated devil. I was mad. I thought about them, who were they to judge me? I don't care what they think but I care what they do. They don't care what happens to people that they pick on. Something weird happened. This thought started to make me feel better and I held my head my high (I never do that) And I thought  I don't care what any one thinks.  I was still stomping though. But then I got stuck behind this year seven who stopped in the middle of the path for a bit and then started walking. He made me laugh. Thanxs mate. So I didn't feel like the heated devil, I felt like the devil wearing a frilly pink tu-tu on ice. :) Just spreading some happiness (rare). Don't care what any one thinks, especially bitches. Oh and by the way... DEATH TO LISA BODEN. Hey, I can be a bit angry can't I?

Why can't every one accept what they see? Maybe I'm not better. Sometimes you might not want to but don't you have to? What happens when you hallucinate? Guess it's hard to see what's real then. Some thing to think about...or not. Thanxs for making me happy, I'll go unblock every one now.

Oh, I might as well phone Laura. Mmm I keep thinking about my pom-pom coat! Hehe...maybe I should go and search for it! Hmm...dodgey government! They're putting a programme on about teachers. Think they're hinting something? Oh I mucked this up by putting a poll on, but don't worry, I took it off. Umm I'm looking at some one talking a class full of boys...hey! I know what you're thinking! Hehe, a kid asked do you feel imtimidated by us! Wish I had the nerve...hehe... Fun, teaching? Don't those usually not mix? I really should change the channel and get off the net. Oh and if any one finds my marbles e-mail me at  urlLink notyetcracked@hotmail.com  Or find another way of annoying me. (See Izzy)

      Flods. Oh great. It's a purple monkey! My brother went all out and downloaded BonziBUDDY and oooh baby isn't it bad. It kind of makes you wanna punch it. Weirdest voice in the world. Wow. These people get a thrill out of making a CBBC website. Hehe, chat about there new look, no seriously do they think eight year olds would want to watch this programme? What am I doing watching it any way? Oh yeah, Neighbours is on. Good, America's sleeping. That means the nets not busy! Is America sleeping? Oh and Izzy, I missed Flint the Time Detective! I'm sorry! Oh and you know every one says we're hippies. Well I don't know about Izzy but I'm closer to a jitter. (Jitter? Gitter?) Hehe. We should go to a party (if we ever get invited to one) and be hippies! Just to overly piss them off. We're not hippies though. They're just judging us by what we wear. Hmm...wonder if you can punch the monkey. Oh and about walking home...! Well my brother started shouting at me but I thought he was shouting at some one else so he legged it down the field! Hehe. Prettttty quickly as well! Yeay! If my knee keeps this up then the growing pains will stop me from doing cross-country (Oh-no I really care) Well at least it's not affecting my weight...Is it?! Aargh! Oh great force fead carrots... Umm any one want to come round my house every day and eat carrots? Didn't think so. Hey I'll try to post Izzy on this with HTML! And she won't be able to...muhaha!

      Good for you Izzy. Yes, I'm here. Sorry I wasn't here yesterday and you had to look at Izzy's blog... Hehe. Some one got here by typing in 'halloween costumes dirt cheap' on Yahoo. Scary thought huh? Well I changed the sub heading thingy to Ca me tuait! Hehe. Guess what that means. Oh, oh! I have a cool furry coat with pom poms! Wow! Well...I'm getting it for Christmas but we bought it and I'm actually going to get it! Stupid people in boot room! I want to buy this pair of shoes (like really really four weeks want to) and I need it in size nine. But I can't get it! :( They never have it in stock and the people at the boot room look down on you and it's scary in there... Mmm food. I haven't had any breakfast cause we're going out for dinner and I got up about half an hour ago! So at the moment I'm thinking about eating the computer... tempting thought... Wow. I really do have a boring life! Who did kill Mr Body any way? Err...my brothers locked himself in his room and he's listening to Lady smith black mambazo or something like that. Have fun with your life. Bubi.

It's now been declared my official hobby - Cracking peanut shells. I'll have to add that to our list of crazy things. I think i'm going to turn into a peanut soon cos i seem to smell faintly of peanut butter.

I think it was Laura, but she wasn't in the game... I'm also wondering why I'm not asleep but I'm not finding the answer... Oh and hey Minton isn't that scary... sorry about the delayed annoyance that's me. Nothing to type, compared to everything else this has to be the most boring blog ever... Oh, sorry Izzy, I forgot to look at your blogs. Wow! Mine looks like a masterpiece now!

      What's scary about my life. 1. I don't actually have a life, it's a illusion that some small genetically modified lamposts made up to keep themselves interesting during their summer break from school. 2. I'm tryping this, proving Izzy's theory about us being mad true. 3. Izzy keeps mentioning the fact that her five year old brother 'fancies' me and Izzy's going to have her face rearranged. Remember Izzy I have a lot of dirt on you! (All I'm saying is a pillow and someone called Sam G...) 4. Chris keeps jumping on my bad and not getting spiked by my spikes. (That was the whole purpose of me having spikes on my bag.) 5. The thought that we have no control over our lives, what happens, happens . Fate it fate. (Don't dempt fate, especially with green candy floss. 6. Yes, Jason the oogly-boogly weird eyed person is scary! BUT HE FANCIES IZZY!  So ha! (And I'm not going to let that go either...hehe.) 7. David the other scary person who hangs round with us. What's even more scary is Emma likes him. Oh about the pink flares. No. We don't get embarrassed... Oh Laura. Astro poo has been the word of the year! Erm tell your Mum to give us worms! Hehe, I'm gonna go do what I do best. Muck up  urlLink this website!  Scary no. 8. I've got the song Sven Erikson in my head because of Laura and I can't get it out! 9. People actually see this! Oh on a ending note-FREE THE LAMP POSTS!

      Oh great, msn still doesn't work. (Think I'm hacked?) Probably knowing my luck! Well I was thinking (Oh dear.) about how you don't actually know what's going on in my head. You can't even begin to think what it's like. No one can know everything about some one because they might not tell you stuff. So you may be reading this and seeing a different side to me than I see and every one else does. We all have different layers, some times we show more than we would want to. (No gross thoughts ok?) So think about it! Grrr...stupid msn...*cough* Any way, umm, ok Izzy, I'll try to go on geocities!

      WOW! I actually got on this! Well my brother's been hogging it, and I can't get on msn! :( Hmm, four small blogs, as in one sentance per blog. Two largish ones...oh yeah, right! Hehe, look what I've done though! Hehe I'm watching this really stupid paintball programme yeay! PE was really annoying. Becki had a thing about ignoring Emma and me, but then we had to show it. So I kind of crouched down for the whole thing saying 'Emma! What are they doing?' Cause they added loads more stuff. Hmm, fun fun fun! Then, when I was walking home (yes, it's Izzy's favourtie subject) I went a bit crazy and started classing every one as sweets... No, I'm not going mad *cough* hey! So erm, oh, I'll tell you if you want to hear it or not! These two parents, and two little kids walked past and one of the kids was wearing these stupid but cool sun glasses. So they were sweet. Then this 'lady' walked past. She sucked her lip in, refused to look at me and tarted about. She was sour. Then this weird man walked past and I couldn't work it out so he was lolly pop...I'm sure you're all admazed by this! Hmm, why is my internet soooo rubbish? I'll just stay on this cause it's the only thing that works...no, to keep your sanity I'd better go. Oh and Izzy I'm trying to put Zigganought on geocities! (If it'll ever load!)

Everyone refers to him as Him. You write the rest - i have to go.

      argghh Katie's turning into the electric monk.. what's wrong with a pink world anyway? It would solve a lot of problems like... uh... People who are colour-blind! Yeah! and uh....trying to decide what colour to paint your wall! ok i'm yalking rubbish now aren't i? An orange world would be kind of good though if you think about it cos you wouldn't have to remember all the different names of different types of fruit because they'd just all be oranges. But that would be kind of bad actually cos you wouldnt be able to tell fruit polos apart - you'd just have to guess when you took one out of a packet whether or not it's an orange one, cos you might think it was a purple and it would end up being a gross-tasting orange which could get a little annoying. But on the other hand, if the world was blue you wouldn't be able to tell the ground from the sky and you might end up walking upside down. But- if the world was green that would be really god because you could eat all your favourite foods and you wouldn't have to eat green vegetables because all the other foods would be green - wow! That would be so cool- if your mum told you to eat your greens up you could go and eat a bar of green chocolate instead. but that ould kind of backfire because we'd all be  grossley unhealthy.

Any way, why not promote your site yourself? More fun and you can understand the internet more... Any one got $59? How much is that in £'s any way?

Oh god, you know some one who has a voice that drags on and it's like shut up?! (Just pretend you do!) Well any way umm it's got some one like that on the radio...why am I listening to the radio? Oh no, no NO! I'm listening to country and western radio! I'll just go break it...be right back... You'll now be happy to know that it's stopped. Any way are we gonna have a Halloween party? Oh and are we going to go trick or treating? My parents give out scabby treats, but no one ever comes round...the way I see it is if they get nice stuff and no one comes I get it! Ohh...I feel sick...hmm maybe it's because I've been on the playstation for ages? I was trying to destroy this boss and I tried three times! All adding up to about an hour! Then I finally defeated him (yeay!) and he unleashed this attack after he died...and I died too...Grr! Hey Laura, you a skin head then or what? Oh I'm sorry Izzy, giving me and Laura site exposure (clever huh?) I'll add your site to the links bit *sigh* Hey! Does our expage thingys still work? Do me a favour Izzy and go check! Oh and can some one please blog! Cause at the moment I keep talking to myself...and although I'm the head of freaks there aren't any freaks online! :( Boohoo, all alone. Any way can you think up a sub-title thingy cause I put it as 'Can it' cause I was in a bad mood...ehe...so umm any better ones? Oh and maybe I could muck around with the HTML and make our website...PINK! I'll try, might make me sick though. Have a fundidileoodle day!

      Hey, I calmed down! Don't ask me what I'm doing up at nine in the morning because I don't know! Guess I'm just a little bit too weird today...weird and sleepy...zzz... Hmm I had a dream, I can't remember what it was about or what happened in it, but that's just me. I was thinking before I had the dream, about how my brother had cancer, and my Nanny had it, About how my Nanny and Grandma died of the same thing, fate? Well it makes me think how lucky we are to be alive! And when you talk about some one (behind their back odviously) all you talk about is the bad things, why not talk about the good things? Be happy to be alive! If you aren't then...well...it's like you're wasting a life. Just be happy with what you've got, who cares if your best friend's a millionaire and all you've got is a few quid? Money doesn't make you happy. It just makes you greedy, and want to show off. When you show off it makes people feel bad, so what's the point of it? Communism was a good idea I guess, just had corrupt leaders that liked killing people. I think American's were afraid of it because it ment that every one was equal, had the same amount of money, clothes and every thing! Some parts of America are glittering with money, and some are poor. I don't think they could try it because all the rich people would become a little bit poorer which is not the Americans way of life. Have a nice day and try to ignore me if you can!

      ...I'm sorry, I must be in shock. I'm watching Top of the Pops for raisons unknown. (Very big raisins) First I watched this guy in a cilt *whatever*...a gold one prancing about with bimbo's in the backround singing "it's alright to be my mate" or something. He then added "I want to get drunk here with you" which I was not very impressed by. The crappy producers at totp the continued their crappy run by calling Ash rock. Now I'm watching two people dressed in white rolling on the floor...Which brings me to the question  WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING TO EVERY ONE?  Have you all gone hollow in the head or something?! I like rock ok, rock as in THE GOOD MUSIC oh and ska. I haven't met one person who can honestly say they don't like ska. And this crappy music you call 'disco' music, I ask, what is the point? Why do we want to see boys prancing round in stupid costumes 'dancing?' Why? Now we have a load of pop people pretending to be like rock on. Get a life. I mean the bimbos in the backround of that song. Really, is our society so slow that all we have on the tv are bimbo's. Let's have a news flash. News: four girls found in Nailsea, big news, NOT BIMBO'S OR SLUTS!!! Isn't that fab? Then singing about drinking and how cool it is. Do these people care? No. All they care is that they get our money. Why listen to music that makes you think that to be normal you have to be this: | thin and look like a modle, throw yourselves at men and drink and smoke to look 'cool'? Please...NOOO! Oh God, they made a song about Sven Erikson *sigh* now this is the stuff that makes you embarasssed to be British...not that I am err...*cough* Yet again we have the bimbo's, and these people who can't even sing. Then they have these 'thugs' they stereotype men as 'thugs' and women as 'bimbos' I HATE THAT! WHY DO WE ALL HAVE TO BE NORMAL ANYWAY? I say stuff that, be yourself, be individual oh and if you see Eminem KILL HIM! Sorry about this moral blabing, I must be in a bad mood or something! Have a nice day.

      Hi there laura! i got your really great email reminding me of what we heard 1000 times! I think we're kind of brainwashed i am an idiot by it and we might just start saying i am an idiot in the i am an idiot of a sentance without realising it i am an idiot.   So anyway, after my stupid angry computer decided it would make my day by deleting all my rambling about cross country i'll type it all again for all you lucky things to read -  No i won't, i'm fed up of thinking about it. Hey i've just got an email back to me saying that my reply to laura@aol.com *way to post Laura's e-mail, sorry had to change it for Laura's sake* or whatever (wonder who she is) could not be delivered because you don't accept emails with attachments yaahda yaahda yaah... but there were no attatchments! Grrrr.... So that's why you didnt get the logo thingy ohhhhhh... see my powers of deception are admazing.  And arghh!!! these stupid boys keep following us around, we so are freak magnets, and katie hasa decided that she's the head of the COF Gang (Collection Of Freaks) and that we're all freaks. (Speak for yourself) And Nooooooooo I have to put up with scary freaky derranged David Greening at Orchestra tomorrow. The words Why Me? come to mind.... He should be given the Nobel Freak Prize for biggest freak. And Charlotte still owes me £3 !! Her stupid brother took it grrrr... Or DID HE? find out after the break.

      Heloo! Today's Friday, hmm, I just wrote Friday by accident! Wish it was Friday, but unfrotunatly it's Thursday! Oh interesting stuff happening...not a lot, apart from Dumbo Laura saying 'I am an idiot' 1,000 times! Yes, she kept count! (Nuts) I was like really early home too! I'm so happy! I kind of ran out, at jogging pace! Well today my knees killed and they started going half way across the field that I walk over! (field, I mean playing field of a school, not a country one!) and it hurt a lot. :( And then it decided to be smean and not let me bend it which, if you're trying to walk hurts a lot. You would think that if your knees hurt you would walk slowly, odviously I'm an exception because I legged it home more than usual because of the pain. When I got home, I pumped myself full of Ibruprofen, actually two tablets and got hassled by the cats. I'm in a colapsed state, state of mind really but my knees have gone all woobly. Isn't woobly so much better than wobbly?! (See what I mean by collapsed!) Two l's or one? I don't know, I've colapsed. *Whatever* Oh yeay Neighbours is on! (Wooh!) In...about an hour. :( Well see ya! Keep on woobling!

      Wow Laura's on! *que cheer* I'm talking to Kat! Yeay! *que other cheer* Oh and sorry about not coming on yesterday but my mean brother was on! Send hate mail to... nah, I'm not that mean...hehe. Ahh well, she went. Hmm I think I have a blocked bug *passes it to Izzy...gets it back because Izzy already has it* Oh and I don't know what's up with the *'s! Never mind Katie, we all know that you need help. Fun fun fun walking home yesterday! Hehe, well firstly I got my trousers on back to front after pe (go on, have a good laugh then) and you know the crease you get at the front? Well it was sticking into my bum, now trying to cover this up I was overly swinging my boot bag and I think I had my umbrella up and was kind of being blown away. I was talking to this girl next to me about being blown away and kind of doing the stupid things you do when I realise she hadn't even noticed me. So I got blown away, looking and walking like a idiot. (Life's cruel) Oh deary me. Any way today I walked home again! WOW! And err, it was fun! I walked with these people for a bit, then stampeeded off on my own. But I got to a point when this boy-I-know's-sister was walking in front of me. I mean slower than a snail walking. She's a bit queer actually. She had a habit of getting to a point then running along for a bit (?) crazy if you ask me...Maybe she was chasing an invisable raisin that had got away? She looked really stupid because she was carrying her bag on her shoulders with her hands (try to understand) and flaling her legs this way and that and her bag kept swinging and hitting her. Thus making her look more like a monkey than a...monkey! Hehe, actually I think she was a bit gone in the head, and we all know about that don't we  Izzy and Laura  I'm a bit scared about Friday because, get this Laura I HAVE TO WALK TO SCHOOL!  shock shock horror horror!  I'm sorry, I just like using the italic and bold things! Wow, we're thinking of having a Halloween sleep over! Laura and me are going as witches! Wow! Izzy's going as an alien *no comment otherwise I'll get told off! ;)) And it's gonna be fun! Or at least I think it is...oh well.  Oh geepers! Neighbours is gonna be on in half an hour! Wow, hmm, is it better than Eastenders...? (Sorry to end on that boring question but my brains frizzled out with piano work and it's not bothered to think of anything else to say!)

      Well this is a tester for a new blogger my...er...*great* friend Laura who wants to join! (It's a nice way of telling her she's queer) Hehe, well here you go Laura type stuff!  Laura: i am laura who is not queer okay maybe a little bit. my sister is in a big stress  with me . i kinda was a bit annoying . then she tried to kill me (that'll keep katie happy) For katies sake- she did it with the doorstop.  hello everybody . when i walk home i get blown away by the wind and one day a crashed in to the loony bin they tried to shove me into a white jacket thing but i got away. I was out in the wetted and the blow or for izzys sake, the bletted and the woe.izzys obssessed with invisble raisins it was funny at first but now its just scary. I think invisable raisins are evil.

      Wohohoho! Ahem...just stuck in Mary Poppin land... So I was very clever walking home, I managed to get half way across the field but then my umbrella started dragging me off (you had to be there) so I put it down and I put it inside my bag :) Oops, I think it might of been the lack of sleep getting to me because we had a family get together yesterday. Then I got to my front door and thought about it (it took a long time for my brain to react) My great Aunt's 85! Wow! Happy Birthday to her for yesterday! I got to see my Auntie's kittens yesterday! (My actual Aunty) hmm Aunt? Aunty? Aargh! They were sooo cute but erm soooo round! Ours are long and thin and hers are short and stubby! (Aww) And here's are only 10 days younger than ours! (I think something's gone wrong with Brodie though, he still looks big and compared to my Aunt's cat about three times bigger!)

       urlLink  I took off the Comment thing because all of them said Comment [0] which was kind of depressing in a way... Kind of woke me up to the fact that i am talking to myself and no one is actually seeing this, just nice to think that they are. I guess my computer's having fun viewing it... *cough* Erm...hmm oh oops dang darn it! Sorry, just seeing if you were half asleep yet. It would be kind of freaky to get a e-mail though, cause I ramble on about how my life is and it would be some one commenting on my life (I'm not sure I'd like that) but in the other hand it would be awkward (is that how you spell it?) cause they would kind of 'know' you and you wouldn't have the foggiest who they were. (I love that saying, it's like jumped the gun, what does that mean any way?) They would relate to your situation, but you wouldn't know what situation they were in. Quite sad actually, I have no fellow blog friends, all the ones I've recently seen are people saying mean things at you, and the others are people rambling on about how they're life is the worst in the world and I don't really want to know about that. Other people are trying to be all cool, but frankly my darling I don't give a damn how much alcohol they drank or how popular they are. (Who does any way?) What a sad sadistic life. (What does sadistic mean?) Umm...any way, I'll just go on pretending to use the clever words...shut up head... Oh dear, my Dad made us all a curry, I think it just hit my stomach...eugh... (How do you spell stomach/stoumach?) Hmm. Oh and I have a ulser (whatever) right by my tooth and it rubs and hurts....ARRGH! I've become one of those sad people I was talking about! (Well at least I'm not Izzy) Have fun, meer mortals...Muhahahaaa! :[ And no, I haven't been drinking, or taking stuff, it's only minstrels that do that to me... and no, minstrels isn't a drug, it's a chocolate...mmm. I'm off to find interesting blogs...mail me if you find one! Hehe, that's notyetcracked@hotmail.com for all you people who are like me and don't use the thing that pops up when you click on that...of course everyone knows what I'm talking about, I guess I do live in my own world (lucky us)

      ...back to the story!!! In the last episode... never mind lets just get on with todays load of trash... SO there i was with my pink umberella and my pineapple trying to fend off the evil shooing shoelace - when SUDDENLY who sould come along but - THE INVISIBLE RASINS! They were visible invisible raisins from the planet zopsicle. They used their magic powers to ward off the evil shooing shoolace and used their powers of persuasion to lure the shooing shoelace onto a plane aeroplane and go to outer mongolia - and that was the last time i saw my dear friend the shooling shoolace.. *sniff sniff.. (I thought you said the shooing sholace was bad Izzy?) Shhh! it's for dramatic effect! So anyway, i was most grateful to the kind visible invisible rasins and all thy asked for in return was a hand-crafted pair of ancient wooden japanese dungarees. ( I didn't know dungarees were from japan Izzy) Aha! they're not - that's what i was coming to - stop interrupting! (Sorry) You should be.  SO  Thats when i turned to my friend the good old Swedish Pink moose. (I didn't know he was Swedish..) There you are again - interrepting! (You spelt interrupting wrong) Do you want to hear the rest of this story or not?? (no)  As i was saying... because i did my dear old moose friend a favour back in 1952 (But You-) *DONT SAY ANYTHING* he offered to help me. Now Mr. Pink moose is a champian Japanese craftsman and he skillfully made me a pair of...hey! Wake up! (zzzzzzzz.....) Hey!! Was the stroy that boring??? I was just about to get to the part with the neon-flashing clown! Aww....That's all for today folks...

Maybe putting on some music would help... Is there no peace in this world? Hmm, I just found ICQ again! Wow! Not that there's any one to talk to on it... But maybe it'll keep me quiet for a bit. Nope, no one online. Bummer. Oh Izzy's on. *cough* horrah *cough*

      Any way I'm normal now 'horrah!' Is that how you spell horrah? It's kind of tacky, and I don't know why I used it. Oh and no English people use it, we're not like the tv, we're like the microwave. What was I saying about normal? Oh well, guess I'm having a weird year, maybe even a weird life. But wouldn't that make it a normal life for me if I did it over and over again? (the weirdness) Wooh! I'm making people's brains tick! When I say people's every one knows I mean Izzy's. Look down the blog page and see how many entries are Izzy's. 1 : 20000000000000000000 (Izzy's the 1) Oh wow, it's a ratio, go on Izzy, work it out *shiver* Stupid maths teacher. Oh I'm going to a happy 85th Birthday party for mm Great-Aunt! And I'm saying oh too much. Guess I'm happy cause I'm about to go Christmas shopping! Yes, yes, I know, Christmas is ages away. Tell my nutty Aunt that! She likes to get Christmas presents arranged months before hand, otherwise she nags you. (It's a fun kind of life isn't it?) Seeing as all the Christmas presents are around at this time, we have to go. On my list is: cool fire shoes! (That's right, burn me alive.) And a cool Quicksilver coat! Wow! Hey I just noticed I do (that) too much! It's just what the inside of my head is doing! (Not much) Or it's me talking to myself...you figure it out... (Yes Katie, I will)

      Hmm I think that every one has a place to be in life. Who ever we are and whatever we look like we can all do something good. You can live your life at 20 stone and think 'I acheived something.' Who cares about the brainless bimbo's that cross your path now and then? If I had a lawn mower everyone who told me to 'get a life' would be bald in ten seconds flat. Why should we have to put up with other peoples ignorance? It just makes me happy to know that I'm happy with life and hopefully it rubs off on other people. I know that I have my off days and strike out at people but that's not the real you. Some people just find it hard to say sorry. I find it quite admazing how one little word can ruin some one's day, constantly thinking about it. So admaze yourself today, admit the mistake and say sorry. No one is in the worst place, no one has had a completely ruined life, you just think you have. No matter who or what we are I think we should all have the best in life. Yes, terrorism is wrong but should a war be started that kills so many lives just to satisfy the peoples need for 'justice' but why have these people done this and what is the right thing to do? I don't think any one can get the correct answer, I think we can only guess. We all have created our own sense of justice and it's not right to compare one to another, it's the rules by which we life by. I am just happy to be alive, think of how many times in your life you may not of been so lucky. Think of how many people have died wishing 'I wish I could of...' Think how lucky you are to able to do these things. Don't let a moment pass you by without fully appretiating it. So everyone get up and live! (I'm sorry, I'm having a moral understandings kind of day :) ) Add comments to my moral ramblings if you want to, and make some one's life worth living. (I'm sorry, I'll try to control it.)

      Every one was kind of being mean to me today. Well I walked a bit with some people then they walked off and I overly avoided every one else (I was kind of trying to dum it into them that they're mean cause they are) well they probably are... Then I get home and phew Mango's ok. (He threw up yesterday and he had the runs and he wouldn't eat!) Poor ickle kitty! Then I flooped down here. Floop? I recon that should be added to the English language! Floop: commenly used by Katie. Real meaning: unknown. Yes that's right, I'm Katie not Kes (fooled you!) Hmm! Well guess I gotta research marijuana now! It's a hard life but some one has to do hw (not Izzy) Oh and on a moral ending: why is the world so confused? (Sorry about the short blog but some one (you know who) isn't posting any so this is a blog-strike on my behalf! So that means that Izzy will have to type something...doesn't it? (I think Blogger's going to my head!) Any one else notice how the top 10 blogs is in a continous loop? (Don't worry, this is number 11!) ;)

Hehe, she's so stupid the only reason she hang's out with year nine's is because no one in year eleven likes her! (Wonder why...?) Join the NABBUSP today...Oh and by the way I talked to the Chocolat mousse mouse and he told me that you and the Earth and minton were hatching a way to avoid having PE! But the sad sad sad consequence of this was not comming on blogger so I told him this was a lie and he said it wasn't. So I asked the blue frog standing next to me and he told me that Neighbours was on in a minute! :O

      sorry i havent been on for so long you see... what happened is this... i was walking along, (well actually i was bouncing along on a purple spacehopper) and SUDDENLY i fell down a hole. But this was not just any old hole, this was the holy hole which lead to a strange and mysterious moose. (moose, izzy?) well yeah i think so. anyway, this moose was so big that it could fit in my pocket! imagine! But it wasnt just any moose, it was the Chocolate mousse moose! It sat down and started to eat - yes you guessed it- a pineapple of course! But then i thought - oh no! i have to get back home soon so that i can go on blogger or else katie will be cross! So, i did what i'm sure you would have done in this situation, i asked the pink moose- ( i thought you said it was a chocolate moose izzy?) Who's telling the story here? for asock to stuff in the top of my pink umberella. (naturally) so that i could skillfully affix the moose's pink pinapple (that he graciously sold to me in exchange for a pink orange) to the handle of the pink umberella to counteract the air reistance. I tied it on using a pink shoelace. But this was not just any pink shoelace... it was the shooing lace which shooed away anything in its path! it shooed so hooingly that i was shooed onto my back and landed on the floor! TO BE CONTINUED (because my mums telling me to come off)

      It was bored. Everything it had seen had been the same thing over and over again. New species. Species dies. New species. Sure it had been hit by a few asteroids and thrown up a few volcanoes but nothing new was happening so it decided to take a nap. It had been working for a few billion years and it felt like a nap, maybe even a vacation! So the Earth dreamily drifted into a deep slumber. A few thousand years later the Earth awoke. It wasn't surprised to find a few more holes in it's shell, that was all expected but now a new species had turned up and developed. It caught the Earth's attention. The Earth was rather proud of it's new toy and took great delight in seeing how it reacted to things. First it threw up a volcano (that should get them going). The new species fled. 'Oh, so it's a bit clever' then the Earth thought. It then decided to change the temperature and see if they would fry. So it stoked up the belt round the middle of the Earth. The new species skin started to change, and changes in temper changed too. All in a few thousand years work for the Earth! It watched the species fight and live and it watched how it was deeply saddened at the loss of one of their species death but was quite happy to kill other things. The Earth thought this was naturel, and well, it is. So the Earth was pleased. Then suddenly the new species started creating havoc, it started depleting the Earth's wonderful fur coat lining that it called it's O-zone layer. They ripped it to shreds and the Earth was getting terribly sun burnt. Then they started terrorising each other in mean ways and the Earth was ashamed of it's new species. Had it changed so much in the thousands of years? No the Earth thought. It had just found new ways to wreck and destroy things.  Had a bad day-sorry! Oh Izzy feel free to take the 'micky' out of me!

      Sorry my loyal fans that this hasn't been updated. Oh and Daisy the flying pig is okay now and the tree is unharmed. Hmm parallel universe or just pure fantasy? I'm going with the fantasy... Anyway I have this thing in my knee that kills so I get to miss PE! (Muhahahaaa!) Woohoo! Oh and about walking home... (It was tough but some one had to do it!) About that... well I was thinking (bad sign) (shut up with the ( ) !) Hmm I need to talk to some one... other than myself! ANYWAY I WAS WALKING HOME good that shut her up. I was walking home and I was thinking about how you're judged about how you look and act and everything and how that happens with the parents walking past to collect the primary school kids from the school that I was past. You can breathe now. I was thinking how sad it is that people compare themselves to each other, but is it so sad? It might be kind of strange but in a way it makes you feel better. In a horrible way. If you say "Gee whiz, look at her hair!" (And God help any body that does say Gee Whiz) That means that maybe you feel a bit unsecure about your hair and it makes you feel better and gives you a confidence boost... enough of my ramblings. But that's what blogger's about... isn't it? Hmm I really should tell all this to something else other than a computer! (Not that any one else than my computer and Izzy reads this!)...OH. OH... OH... darn. Darn this blogger no-cussing (for you Americans) thing! Non-swearing for people who know what that means... Umm HELP! I just uhh lost the start bar and this screen has gone allll big. I mean whole screen big! (I'm good at mucking up my computer aren't I?) Who needs a virus when you can do it yourself!? Oh I better go...and pretend that nothing happened! Oh and I'm working towards telling some one my ramblings...some day! E-mail me (Hah!) if you want to hear... and no the world isn't pink... or is it?

      Helloo!!! I found this really cool site with the button game! and you have to press the button within the time limit and then you have to presss it as many times as you like, and then you can end the game whenever you want! Sounds lame? It is! But theres a grand idiots hall of fame - it measures your idiot level by how long you spend clicking the button! Dont interrupt me! I'm exactly 843 clicks away from getting into the hall of fame!!

      Ok. No, no guest book. I put a sort of thing on where you could add comments but all of them were at 0 which was kind of depressing so I got rid of it. Would you really want a guest book? People would say what they thought about your life. They would judge you! Oh and these dogey people keep sending me e-mails. No one usually knows what your talking about. Of course Phil's going to find out! You missed a lot and yes I saw Eastenders. Oh and hey, I can show you final fantasy if you want! It's soooo cool! But you're afraid of the fighting things bit. Hey that's easy! Err...apart from the harder ones like Bahumut (or however you spell it!) he's hard. Oh and Edel is too! And Ultimacima talk about arrrgh! But hey, you should come round and play on it! I've only died about three times...well actually closer to seven. (Shhh) Hmm go on it! Promise? Okay then, next time you come around. Hmm I think Final Fantasy VIII is a bit *cough* easier so go on that! See you then! (Hehe sucker!)

      hello! If you thought you managed to get off doing the R.E thing - think again, she said we could do it next week, but we have scary visitors coming in so we might have to do it infront of them! :S Oh yeah, i put you in the larries group, which has a whole 2 people in in! (you and alex) I'll just read your blog about final fantasy and pretend to understand who you're talking about. Hey, do we have a guestbook on here?  Do you think anyone reading this knows what we're talking about? Do you think Phil is going to find out that Mark's not the dad? Do you think i even know what i'm talking about? Hey, did you see Eastenders last night? I missed it. Yet another of hassall's friends have added me - and they're talking to me and they're in the middle of a lesson at school, and we have an inservice day! Woooooo!

      Hmm, wonder what group I'm in? Oh god, I watching a programme about people looking for a lover on the thames. Does desperate even come close to it? I think it does... I've been off school like all week apart from Wednesday! Woohoo! (I wondered why no one's coming near me!) I'm quite sad actually ...I saw the end to Final Fantasy VIII. Boohooo! Well ok, I'll break the news slowly. It looks like Squall's dead but then all this woosh stuff happens and then further on Selphie points at Riona and she points up and it cuts out! So you don't know if Squall's actually dead! It's like in FFVII when Aeris dies. :( Hey, what can I say, I cry at movies. Phone again. :( The phone keeps going all the time! Stop phoning! It's my mum and dad. Kind of on the lines of: Are you dead yet? Hey Izzy you are on a different planet! Mr Thackray is pooey, we should make a pooey list! Wow how original! If you live in a dream then you waste a life. (But hey, who believes that?)

      Playdays! You should be ashamed!  Awww poor you, but you did manage to miss mr.k in a big stress! It was funny cos Laura and Beki and me were in the music block at registration (cos we had chamber group and then music) and beki was bored and she drew this picture of mr.k on the board (hey, bored - board! wow! ok, carrying on,) with no hair and a manic grin and smoke coming out of his ears! And when he came in he was in a really big stress and he pulled the board down and saw beki's picture! Need i say more... Hey! I tried to search on Google for our site by typing in peanut shells (scrool up or check the archives if you don't know what I'm talking about) and I found this site with the word "peanut" the word "shells" and it was made by someone called Kes and someone called Izzy! How freaky is that? And no, I'm sure it wasn't the same one. *sigh* Wow, must be wierd forgetting things like that, could have used it to your advantage though, and forgotten what vincent looks like, oh well. Arghh, Pooey stupid Mr.Thackray kept picking on me in maths again and making jokes about me being on another planet (don't say anything) and looking like I was asleep, I  was looking at the board like everyone else! Six times in one leson he'd picked on me, calling me Iz, with his big smarmy egotistic (is that a real word?)  voice. Oooh, he makes me mad. And Emma said that Father Christmas wasn't real! and everyone (most of us) was saying that we still believed in him and Emma was getting in a big stress and taking it really seriously, and ooh! - I can come to Claire's partay (oh - yay is hear you cry) cos the smelly concerts on a different week. I was having fun yesterday sorting all my contacts on msn into groups (you can do that on the new version, its cool) and I have Boring people who never talk, People who are never online, People who should rot in hell (guess who's in that one) Strange friends, and Larries!

      Wow! It's Why bird! I'm so ashamed, I can't remeber what the programmes called! Oh I'm at home cause I'm ill. :( On Saturday I was really week and tired all the time, then on Sunday I hit my arm and went downstairs to get some arnica (don't ask) and I blacked out and fainted. Apparently I hit my head really hard, then when I woke up I kind of had some spasms or some thing? I was actually really confused and I didn't know who I was or who my parents were! Took a few minutes to remember. Today I feel dizzy and sick. Healthy huh? My mum thinks I've got a bug. Hmm, if I go to school tomorrow Laura should get it and I'll be fine...good...good. Mango isn't being very nice. My right leg looks like a scratching post and it really hurts. He scratched my big toe and it hurts. :( (Grr stupid cat...) Broadie was too, but Cleo was purring so loudly that I couldn'y hear the tv! Have a healthy day.

That stupid Louise nabbed it. Sorry I can't type a lot because it feels like I'm gonna faint and I feel really weak. In english, I feel ill, really ill. I'll just go back to sleep now or better than that, faint here. Bubi.

      Ok, so the people on the news say it was an accident, and even if it was, isn't it kind of wierd?? WOW! no school uniform tomorrow! And ohhh! poor Beki! Sprained her ankle and spent ages in casualty! Awww :( Arghh this guy on the radio was winding me up, he was talking about all the latest tragedys on the news in this really happy jolly kind of way. Oh well, but just about the one thing you're allowed to do in life all of the time is be happy, so why not I guess? Probably cos if something really sad happens it is kind of hard to be happy, and if you do try and be happy, you won't be happy inside cos you know that you'll be decieving yourself. I really should stop talking now cos i'm starting to sound like Katie! Help! What's happening to me!?

      Mmm, for three days running, people have died on the M4. Now doesn't that make you feel safe? Ehe. And the Bristol box as it's called is a bad spot. Hmm, well I just go in that about once a week. It's worse than the bemuda triangle it's the BRISTOL BOX! Kind of has an edge to it don't you think? No...neither do I... Well walking to piano! Well this girl was kind of walking on the other side of the road talking (this girl told me she didn't want to walk with me any more, yeah, thanks for that) and I was like tum-tee-tum just looking at the houses dee dee doo. Then she went! Yeay! So then I got to piano (pretty rubbish story isn't it?) and I walked mud all over her carpet! Hehe I was looking at this lush view thinking 'only in nailsea could you find such a lush view in such a crappy place'. Grr, I hate reading-news people, could they find a more boring voice? I walked past this house and on one side it had pointy trees and on the other it had bumpy trees and I thought this is England, trying to be perfect or not. IDIOTS! This girl was saying she thought her brother had the flu but her actually had Lukemia and died. What stupid pathetic idiots... I'm sorry I just feel a bit strongly about this. Yeah, no one really understands about other people feeling sad, I guess no one really wants to. Happy happy. I'm sorry I really should stop watching the news. Aargh! The news! Imber Village is kind of freaky... it's like empty with empty houses. Then you see the army driving around. What?! Crazy! Ahem. Izzy smells like stilton! Tee-hee!

      HAHA! Stupid girl. You are stupid, that was an ACCIDENT in english it wasn't the taliban. (Duh!) If you watched two hours of the news you would of known that. The reason that wars happen are differences of opinions or beliefs. Sad how people have no empathy and won't even try. Any way... about walking home! Well first my brother and his friend nabbed my polo's! Shock horror! Then I was walking across the field and the kids in the junior school started running across my path and I was like arrrgh! Then they turned so I was fine, but then I saw the person who I randomly talked to and a load of other people about to walk my way! So I had to half run to get there before them. Then I walked really slowly behind some one. Is it just me or does that sound really stupid? Let's just hope it's really stupid! Eh? I think some thing's gone to my brain cause I meant to put some thing else! Oh on a finishing note: Izzy, don't jump to conclusions!

      Angry!! MORE ATTACKS ON AMERICA!! dunno if you've heard but another plane crashed in New York today. Hmm... Same city, same country, two months after another 2 planes crashed there, something that has never ever happened before, and the people on the news are wondering whether it's a coincidence or not! I don't think so! This time a plane crashed in a town (cant remember the name) on loads of houses and families and people. Is this the Taliban's way of saying "If you kill our people then we'll kill yours" ? Cos they can't talk, they treat their people like dirt. But it is kind of annoying that the deaths in America get all the sympathy and publicity on the news, when really, it's not all that different from what America is doing to Afghanistan, killing innocent people. But some people think that just because they are ruled by the taliban then it's ok to kill them, but it's not. They must be really confused now. The Taliban are horrible to them and they want to be ruled by the west (some of them) but then the west come along and bomb them and kill them. Am I the only person who thinks the whole thing is crazy? How many more people have to die berfore someone admits that they are wrong?

      They actually made a Barbie film! What's the world coming to? It's got the kind of stuff you'd expect, Barbie with her perfect face, perfect hair and perfect voice. Now we know why they made it using a computer. Hehe, it didn't even get to the cinema. It's quite sad actually, all Barbie's are stick thin. Do we all have to be stick thin? That's like every one being clones, if we all looked like super models would the world be better off? I bet every one would suddenly like large people or something strange. Hmm, getting a bit too deep Katie, snap out of it! Oh by the way Izzy, I have your birthday and christmas present! Can you tell what it is yet?

      Hmm haven't you used that excuse before? I'm sure you have. Grr, I had to walk home from piano with the streets lights on! And these people started shouting "Oy, girl!" so I kind of muttered "What if I'm not a girl." Hmm, crazy. Then this guy started walking in front of me, he walked in front of me all the way home! I saw some people I knew so I kept my head down. Must of looked a bit crazy walking back from school at 4:45! I wanted to stamp 'Just been to piano' on my head but I decided to do it when I got home. Wow Izzy, I didn't know you were imaginary person! Hehe Izzy loves Jason! Muhahaha I'm going to spred it on the net! ...To people that don't even know you!... Oh and my excuse *cough* reason is that I'm being assulted by my Maths teacher with a ball point pen! He's hitting it on my pen! And I'm always being mentally assulted. I'm watching this programme about Norwiegans *whatever* who swapped houses with English people. Hmm, they eat whale beaf. Erm...guess we have different ways of living? And eat sausage rolls on there own. (Who does that?) And they like English beaches? (!) CRAZY! Hey, hate our food and our beer! Go back to Norway then! Well actually England is boring, the food is okay but Izzy said we have cheap chocolate or something...? So erm any Americans out there send me Hersley (Is it Hersley? What do I know!) bars! I loooove them!

      hello! sorry i haven't been on for ages, but I have a really good excuse, i mean - er, reason... Well - I was sitting in the garden on a warm, snowy morning, and having a cup of tea with my friend purple fly. The tea wasn't very nice because it had been made by....the....ok i can't think of anything catchy, oh well, where was I? oh yeah I'm about to get to the part where I think of something really good that happens and get to type SUDDENLY (you all know that by now). yeah so - SUDDENLY a big fish  (fish, Izzy?)  yes, a fish, -sprang out from the bushes and grabbed our tea and held it for a ransom of 21 peanuts!  SO as you can imagine I was very upset.  (er- I thought you said you didn't like the tea, izzy)  You again? Stop trying to be clever! ( but you said  -) Oh fine! I didn't like the tea, but I liked the tea cups, they were given to me from a holy melon in Peru. ( So he took the cups too ?) Yes he took the cups!  (ok then .) Right! can I get on with my excuse, i mean- reason now please? Thankyou!  SO as i was saying... This fish was wearing an extremely dodgey-looking hat, it was bright yellow with little pictures of Mr.Kelly on it with flashing red eyes! The sight of it made me stagger around in a daze, and i fell backwards into a conveeniently  (you spelt conveniently wrong)  shut up! - a  conveniently  placed hole. I fll down and down, and landed ON (wait for it) the PURPLE FLAVOURED WOMBLE BENCH! It was quite uncomfortable, but i didn't mind, as long as I was away from the hat with grinning Mr.Kelly on it. The Purple Flavoured Womble bench was most startled and woke up with a startlingly startled start. "nvoshgatuyakgmnajghal!" it said. I recognized this language immedeately! It was the language of the All-seeing Pink Moose! I don't really know what it said, but it seemed pretty angry because smoke began to billow from it's ears! SO i know what you're all thinking now! - What happened to th Purple Fly? ( no, I wasn't thinking that actually ) that's not the point! Well, because the fish with the bright yellow hat with the mr.Kelly heads on and the flashing eyes saw that i wasn't too upset about the loss of my Puruian Tea Set, he decided to hold Mr Purple Fly for ransom too!  (But uh... I thought you said you were angry about the-)  Well i stopped being angry by then! And he demeded 23 penuts!! ( What can a fish do with penuts? Fish don't eat penuts .) Well this is a peanut-eating fish. ( And how come the fly is purple?)  Well-  (And since when do fish live in bushes?) Uh- (And they don't wear hats, or demand penuts or-)  Well FINE! YOU THINK OF A GOOD STORY YOU SHALLOW MINDED OLD POO WITH NO IMAGINATION OR UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE'S IDEAS!!! YOU SELF OBSESSED LITTLE STUPID SMELLY POOEY OLD SMELLY OLD FART!!! I've just thrown a load of abuse at an imaginary person. Cool. I should do that every day.

      Wow, my mum's been arranging a calander. She's sending photo's off! We found a really cute one of me, took a long time though. Hehe we also found a really stupid one of my brother sitting a toy car with his hair sticking up like a pineapple! And after all this time he hasn't changed a bit! Then we found some other photos...of my Nan...my Grandma and my old cat. We're lucky for the time that we have. Mmm, don't worry, I wrote in my diary last night so you're free from moral ramblings! Oh great, school tomorrow. :(

Mmm, I'm kind of hooked on throat sweets at the moment! Oh and I got my cool shoes! I need to break them in now. Oh and I've given up on getting html to lemme put picture on this! So :P to html!

      8.30? Wow ...you all night party girl *cough* Hello! Finally I can free you from Izzy! Oh, great, my brother put on some really sad music so if I go all depressed send my brother hate mail. ;) Some wierd people have added me on msn and it's quite scary. Oh, the kitchens fitted! Woohoo! And my dad's wall papering at the moment. I think I'll stay up here! Oh great, hw to do. Like I've done any. Oh we got the kittens back! (Have I said that already?) My mum's up in Peterborough, or however you spell it with my Grandpa. Hmm, no, there are some things you shouldn't say. Is it just me or is every one cold? My fingers are going numb. Oh, about the shoes! I put a £10 deposit on them! Woohoo! I'm actually getting them! One bad thing though. When I came out of the shop I err kind of had a bit of a blister. That might of been because I tried four pairs of shoes on... (I like being difficult!) I even tried on the mens size nine! Hehe. Hey, I'm not as sad as you think, they're skate shoes! Made by Buffalo! The only thing now is to wonder if the shoes give me blisters ...hmm! Well we all have to suffer for fashion, do we? My Dad's dragging me into Bristol to go shopping and have breakfast in Bristol! Arggggh! So tired, hmm, guess I better get on with the hw. :( Pink is the colour of the world! (Or should be)

Oh and Izzy don't tuch the name it's sacred. Any way oh I'm supposed to start moaning. Hmm...oh well it's kind of tight in our group cause no one likes this girl apart from me laura and izzy and becki and it's tight on her. They don't have the guts to tell her. Aww.

Don't tell me, it's wrong, I know. Hey can any one help me make this page more interesting (any one? like any one's listening and how could this possibly be more interesting?!) I meant the pink okay?

So there we were in the middle of the field when it started thundering! It's was soooo funny! But it really hurt my legs! Every one got soaked and when it started thundering every one was screaming and running around. I just stood still and laughed! Oh and Lynne, I think I'd not pick any and run! Laura was thinking of taking Uno slam and playing it in the middle! Ehe...so we are sad. Oh and the time's all mucked up cause this is set on American time! Oh I get what you mean now...

      Katie?? What are you on about in your 1/24/2002 3:46:05 PM blogg??? Crazy. The valentines disco - you mean you're actually considering going? Lets all sit around and listen to really crappy music while all the tarts and bimbos dance with popular people that they pretend to fancy - FOR JIM'S SAKE! Sorry but it's my idea of complete boredom. We should have an online disco and invite a load of people and pretend to be listening to good music, yeah!!! Kinda sad how the only socialising we do is on the net. I guess the only interesting people you meet are on the net because Nailsea is so BORING!!! Our year group is really crap. Ahhhh fun times. Ok, I'll shut up now.

      Mmm so like is any one actually gonna go to the Valentine's dance thingy if we have one? It's kind of depressing to though, it kind of rubs it in a bit and every one sits at the side pretending that they're having fun! Well they do! Then all this pointless stuff happens and it's like "Oh my God some one tripped up!" and then this big palava happens so every one won't notice that every one's just sitting around the edge going 'Hmm hmmm hm!' Or is it like that...?

I've got four pieces of homework to do. :) Oh and when will we even need to spell Ouagadougou or however you spell it or say it. Hmm argh! Gotta pick our GCSE choices, then all we've got it SATs, Mock GCSE's, GCSE's A Levels and the rest! Phew sounds like a busy life, doesn't it? Yeah...right... Mmm wonder if the new girl's ok? I was thinking, cause some people take little things more seriously so I'm just wondering if she's scared by David. Mmm I'm going deep! Jim jimmedy jim jim jim, remember, never run with sharp pointy objects. They may be fun until some one gets there eye pocked out! Ehe, you should go now... CABIN FEVER! Aargh! Help me get away from myself. Thing about that... Maybe not... Bubi have fun!

So -SWEETCORN! if anyone can tell me what dreaming about running through fields of sweetcorn with no clothes on means, please tell me! And er - being chased by loads of people and a helicopter. Nothing unusual! I've had that dream 3 times in the last week and its really freaking me out!

      Hey kids! Oh sorry about the not coming on but my computer mucked up (again) and oh yes, so did the other one! Happy happy happy! *DISCLAMER DON'T BLAME ME IF YOURS DOES TOO* Just kidding...hehe... Hmm the colour's mucked up, we can only get 16 bit not 32 bit which is a bummer! So at the moment every thing looke ladode. (La-do-d-e) Fun! Ehe. Oh my New Year was spent at home with my cats, depressing huh? Not really, I was running around screaming "Don't panic!" Because the sound of the fireworks seriously freaked the cats out. Hmm so of all the interesting junk mail I got none of it was interesting. Confused yet? I know I am! I got one about me becoming a baby sitter in America! Uhuh. Even though I'm what, 13? nearly 14 and live in England they still wanna get me to be one. Hmm...guess some one's gotta do it. But...maybe not me, today at least. Hmm oh and Izzy all that stuff I told you you're telling no one otherwise...otherwise...! I give Vincent your mobile phone number! HAH! Oh and by the way I don't want to be a American baby sitter so don't ask. Happy new year and hope you don't catch a bug! Oh, sorry, I was talking to your computer. (Not lost it aye?)

Question and not being able to spell thing of the day! IS it one of these I know more people than you ha, I'm better than you things? Sorry, some music makes me go a bit hyper. Like typing a lot! (eh?) Also I was wondering who was reading this and what they were thinking. Hmm, I do think about every thing don't I? That's what Blogger's done to me, made me think more. I go too deep some times! Hmm, I really need to phone Laura and rant on! So erm bi! And remember erm... Knowledge is power and is hard to spell! Some one said that (apart from the hard to spell bit) and I forgot if I put it here or not cause I'm soooo tired and my head hurts. Think I said that already! Eek! I'm gonna go faint some where.

      Heloo again! Happy wednesday! So any way, I just got back from piano and this lady I leant my book to (mum's friend) has given me a massive tube of smarties! Muhahaha! Mmm so I'm just eating them. Mmm. Hehe, and our next door neighbours were throwing out a whole bathroom set, when I got back from piano it was gone. Recon they heard us talking and took it inside? Hmm, do you ever choose to not know some thing? How dumb do some people think we can be. Maybe you just don't want to admit that you know, maybe you shouldn't know what you know so you don't tell any one. Mmm, the smarties are getting to me, usually takes longer than this! Gotta go chop potatoes.

Plus the computers throwing a wobbly cause it's going funny...maybe that's my eyes. Sorry, it's just kind of hard to type good stuff when you feel awful. (It's even harder to hit the right buttons and make sense of what you're hitting (EH?)) I know, I know. Mmm maybe it's a you've-been-on-the-computer-for-too-long things! Hey so any way I was thinking, why does every one have to be selfish? I guess you have to be to survive. See, I'm ill! Either I'm ill or mad. No comment please! Doesn't the word either look german? Ether. Hmm fun! Geez way too sick! Any way did you know that I've typed 100+ blogs. Hello Katie, does any one care? Good point. Hey I better go crawl into a hole now. Yeah, it better be full of paracetamol. Mmm now I'm having a can't-remember-if-I've-done-that thing. I think it's called amneisa. Yup, if I could spell it, it would be. Any one know where to get a good spell checker? Or a brain. Mmmm. Aargh! I really need to go! I almost got squashed by my bookcase then! It almost fell on me! Hehe. Local girl dies by being hit by bookcase. Greeeat. Bubi. Be happy that you're healthy cause you don't know how long it's gonna last. Depressing huh?

Wow, for some weird reason I'm looking through the English dictionary, probably the same reason why I'm typing this. Oh, news flash IZZY'S ON! Wow! Did you know that pomp means a splendid display or ceremony? Did you even care? Probably not! Hey on the new weird site we should have a quiz to find out what biscuit you are! Wow! (Geez I'm bored!) Hey I wonder if geez is in the dictionary! :O! It isn't! What were thouse guys thinking! Geez! Hmm I was thinking...I should buy a domain. Hey I'm mega bored!

Oh yeah...slower typing, my brothers ill. But he wouldn't let me in so loud typing to get back at him! Muhaha! Mmm. Any way I'm trying to open up this window but it's not letting me! Meanie! I'm proud to admit that I'm a member of POSRAA (Pickled Onion Space Raders Addicts Anonymous) Cool huh? Apart from I'm not Katie...I'm an anonymous person. *cough* (Think I fooled them?) Izzy's setting up a queer site cause we all turned into biscuits...yup. Don't worry I'll put a link, or that is WORRY! Hehe. It'll probably take weeks to finish though cause I never finish sites I start! I was browsing and I found a really cool one!  urlLink http://garnet.nu/garnet/  Trust me it's cool! But that's only really if you've played FFIX. Mmm, I should go walk around the web. I'll shout if I see any thing interesting or step in a puddle. (EH?) Bubi.

Really loud cause my brother set it to say that and her Grandma picked it up! Whoops! I'm not sure if she heard it though! Lol! Music to listen to at the moment is Shut the door by the Mad Caddies!

Ooh yeah it's cause I've got nothing to do. Any way I could be watching tv! I've gone a bit mad playing the piano allll the time, like practising tooo much! It's cause I like hearing the music and I guess you could say that it's one thingt that you can stick with and it won't confuse you! Ehe. I need to phone Laura and have a good old rant...good idea. Have a nice day!

              You're Yuna. You're hardworking and honest, and also a little naive. You can easily be lied to, but in the end your friends will look out for you. Kind and loving you'd never hurt a fly. You'd be willing to do anything to help others, even if it means some personal sacrafices for you.      Which Final Fantasy X Character would YOU be? Take the urlLink test .    Heey! So yeah, we've talked about Pob about five zillion times! Yeah I get that scare other people thing. It's cool on Msn cause if you don't know what to say to them you just scare them and they block you and that embarrassing silence is delt with! (Learn from the master!) Oh dear...I just found a site about Commander Keen!  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/TimeSquarePortal/5308/  Random addy aye? I think you know when you're going mad when you start talking about Commander Keen and Pob! ...It wasn't me! So are people actually scared of us or just laughing at our wierd ideas. I get scared by myself when...OH GOD THE LEFT THE CATS WITH MY CHOCOLATE BAR! Eeek! No that doesn't scare me...well, it does now! I better go rescue it. If I come back with half a arm and teeth marks around the wound it was Mango! Ahh! Saved! Oh that's great Laura, use paragraphs when you don't need them! Hehe. Any way I was looking at this website that said about what Blogging is. I think it makes you think deeper into things because what I type is what's going through my head but you concentrate on it more. It also helps you realise that every one else thinks the same stuff (you'll probably lose me some times but that's ok, I'm just queer) Ooook so on this Commander Keen website they've got a bit called 'Aliens Ate my Babysitter'. Ehe. Ahh....Freak out! Sorry, it's that really bad song from the 70's. Don't you love that " Shiver my timbers shiver my soul. Yo ho e ho!  song! It rules! It was the opening song on Muppet Treasure Island (don't ask how I remember that!) Oh check out  urlLink http://www.muppetworld.com/  if you really wanna get into Cabin Feaver! (Trust me I tried to spell that four times and that looks like the best one!) Ahh. Thought for the day. Or thought of my life! I'm happy with who I am and where I am.

      hello everybody it's simply spiffing to see you. okay i'm scaring myself . i always think that if i scare myself then what must i be doing to other people. people must think i'm really weird. okay so i know that they do. i'm so bored that i think i might be going slightly mad .question:how do you know when you're going mad? i found this amazing game on my computer the other day. It's called Commander Keen and it is the best thing ever! i may possibly the only person in the world that has it but it rools. did anyone used to watch pob? i used to! i try to talk about it but no-one knows what i'm on about. it's about this dudey little guy who spits on the screen at the beginning and writes pob.(it's not as disgusting as it sounds)There must be some other mad pob fans out there! wow, bye for now,i'm off to see if there is a pob website!

      Oooh heloo! Friday today! Woohoo freeee! Ahh I was having serious thinking time when I was walking home! Hmm maybe I shouldn't think so deeply. There is a point between obsession and cleverness....right guys?... Happy mode cause it's Friday and I'm listening to music. Hehe PSE was funny! Oh PSE is personal social education I think. So it's where we all sit down and talk about drugs and things. It's quite easy to say no to drugs. That is if you're not afraid of what your image will look like if you say no. If you have nothing to lose then you have nothing to gain. Ehe. Well it kind of works I guess. You just have to have a strong voice in your head waking you up. I don't have a go at people who take drugs, it won't do any thing. Any way, here's a fact: cannabis isn't actually as bad as smoking! The only reason that the British government won't make it legal is because they think that it'll lead you on to harder drugs. People take drugs to be happy, but I'm like that any way! Do you have to be that insecure to take them? What will people do to look good infront of their mates?!

I'm very touched that you feel that you need to talk to us about things like this Kes.  (Sorry I can't remember your other name!!....I appologise and hide my head in shame.)

      Wow! Laura was on! And Fox Kids doesn't suck! Hmm... Well. What to blab about? Oh yeah...there's this girl at school. Let's call her Blob. Okay so now this isn't gonna sound serious it's gonna sound cheese and tacky! But anyway... I think she got bullied at her last school and she told us she ran away. She was laughing about it yesterday but today she started crying. She wouldn't tell any one what was wrong and didn't want to talk about it, if you tried she would just walk away and I don't know what to do! If she wants to be left alone shouldn't we just leave her alone? But every one needs to talk to people. It's better to do that. She kind of stood there and cried... Help any one? I don't think we should force her to tell us. Just be around for her. But she's new and we don't really know her so she might not think that she can rely on us that much. If we force it out of her it might make it worse. She needs to talk to her parents about it other wise she might do some thing stupid. Maybe they're part of the problem so maybe she shouldn't. Maybe she should talk to the school councillor but maybe she doesn't want to and won't say any thing any way. Sorry but that's what's going round my head. I just don't know how to help her. This is true. I don't know how to help Blob. (Hehe that sounds stupid!) SERIOUS. (Whoops, sorry!) How can you talk to some one that keeps walking away? I think she thought that moving school would make all her problems go away. Nothing can do that apart from yourself. Hmm. If you have a good idea then e-mail me where it says contact by the bloghome thingy! Well, sorry to make you depressed have a nice day and remember where ever you are or who ever you are we are all lucky.

      Heyyy! So...let's talk about baths. (Hey you better nod or I'll start talking about my wierd dreams!) Erm, right. The wierdest thing I found in a bath was a flower! Oh also I kind of found a floating dead spider... *cough* Mmm lovely. Can any one out queer me? Nope! Any way about dreams. I had the coolest dreams! We walked into class and we were late and my white coat kind of had rainbow splotches on it, so as you do Mr K asked why we were late. I said that it had been raining paint and chocolate rabbits! Not chocolate rabby rabbits. Like slabs of chocolate with rabbits printed on them! Ehe. So as you do he said ehe right. But it actually had been raining paint and chocolate rabbits! Mmm! Then I was thinking about how it would kind of hurt if it was raining slabs of chocolate! Hehe. Analyse that! (I'm sure I spelt analalallalalayse wrong but what the whooo!) Every one says what the hey. I'm gonna go now cause I scare myself!

It keeps not showing Tahoma font when I try to type with it on Microsoft Word. I'm also doing this essay on volcanoes and I don't know if it's supposed to be in by tomorrow! Whoops! I think this computer doesn't like me... Maybe if I kick it a little. Bad idea. Last time I did that the monitor cut out! Ahh, back to school tomorrow! Hey when's the day when we're going in later and stuff? Better check the school website. Mmm guess what? It's all in white! Noooo! I haven't actually done any of my hw! Guess I can't be as bored as some people! Check out  urlLink http://www.nailseatrials.co.uk/indexi.html  because...I actually know who some of these people are! (Yeah right) Plus I'm bored and hey, I'm gonna go watch Stig of the Dump! *groan*

      Helooo again! Oh I'm typing every day cause I'm bored and we've got no school. Funny, I'm kind of missing it! I don't get to see every one I see at school and we can't make fun of Mr. Kelly! (Our teacher) But hey I'm going to see a film today! It's either gonna be Monsters Inc or Rat Race. Hey, no one's too old for a U! Mmm I think the stuff in my ear's gone hard! Yikes! Oh well. Oh another thing some how we've got Fox Kids and Fox Kids +1hr! But hey, I'm not complaining! It's got Spiderman and Inspector Gadget on it! Hey I'm a little kid at heart and I love those cartoons! It's also got Flint the Time Detective which Izzy will be soooo happy about. (She's obsessed with it) So I might actually get to see it! If you're as bored as me check out  urlLink Monsters, Inc!  I'll be doing a review on it probably! (I'm that bored!) Actually it's because my science hw is too hard and I lost my big expensive revision book!

      Hi again! Sorry about no blogs, but I've been shopping! I'm really bad at shopping, I guess I'd flunk retail therapy. I went in and came out, the only things I bought was about 100 drinks! Then I got some padded plasters cause my shoes were rubbing! Wierd huh? I had to buy twenty for one! Hehe. Guess it was worth it. Well I kind of put one on, then put a bigger one over the top and Izzy took one and she can't get it off! Owchie! Oh also my brother and his friends are cooking tonight! Aargh! I've gotta phone the doctor before he comes! Don't tell him, but last time he cooked it kind of gave me a bit of a stoumach bug! Mmm. But it's alright, cause he said we're eating Mango! (the cat if you don't follow this, I doubt any one does...apart from if you're looking for pea nut shells! (nod and walk away)) Mmm, still not cured from my manic speaking and typing problem! Hey I got a lot of brownie points today, we helped an old lady because she couldn't get up the escalators (whatever) so we helped her up the lift! Heeey Alkaline Trio are a good band too! Hmm I really really should get paid more! Mmm I should start looking for more people to go on this, it's too quiet and even though every one's oh-so happy listening to me blabbing it kind of gets boring listening to yourself! Oh and now my chocobo's red! Sorry I'm kind of overly obsessed! (Aren't you!) Hey I have to think of some thing really and clever and wise to say, wait a minute......Oh! Be happy who you are and where you are because you could be some one different some where else. Okay so leave out the wise bit and that's fine! (It sounds clever!) I better go raid the biscuit tin and check the cats haven't found it first! Bubi. - Kes

      Heeey! Oh if you click on the thing (counter) at the bottom of the page it shows you how people get here.  I'm that bored.  Any way some one searched for Edna's Goldfish and they got here! (There are some wierd links out there!) Any way, so wow some one else actually knows who Edna's Goldfish are! They rule! It's like ska, but mellow. Ok so I'm not making any sense now. Hmm what to have for dinner? Sorry. Any way I think that there best song is either Instant Message or Sunrise 2 Sunset. You can down load them off of Morpheus or whatever you use. Hey, I'm a sales person for them! (I should get paid more!) Mmm how come people go on this but never e-mail me? It must be one of those, don't know what to say. Yeah, I know the feeling. 'Hey, just saw you're blog, and all the things in your life. My name's Bob. Bye.' Mmm hmm. When I'm older (101) I wanna be a psychiatrist. Hmm. I'll go check the spelling. Wow it was right! So I can say 'Hey, I'm a shrink' Sounds good huh? (NO!) You have to train for five years as a doctor though, then branch out into Psychiatry. (I'm just in it for one of those big long leather chairs!) Apparantly not every one gets one though. :( Maybe a 21st birthday present?! I just love thinking about how other people are thinking...I make it sound so...so...wierd. I think it's great how you can think about why we think that and what other people think. Plus you get to help people so it sounds good. Hmm, now I'm thinking too much! Have fun. Oh and don't eat grass!

      Mmm. Me again. Well I only type one blog a day cause nothing interesting happens to me! It's cause we've got no school, no one's doing any thing stupid so there's nothing to type about! Oh, apart from I turned my chocobo blue! But hey, who wants to know that? And what sort of a name is Choco for a chocobo?! Oh, also we found well I found that we still have a fish in our pond! :O Shock! Geez, that's blummin' admazing! (Doesn't admazing sound soooo much better than amazing?!) I went on some one's blog and they were going on like they're the only brits that use blogger! Heloo! Any way they kept going on about being brits and I was like ok...I'm going now... They were from Bristol too, but I was too freaked by then! See! I need other people to talk! I'm gonna go crazy! Aparantly (I'm sure that's got one e in at least but what do I know?) another.co.uk costs money to get now! But I signed up when they were free so they're being nice to me... or they haven't figured that I'm not paying. I really can't be bothered to pay for stuff on the net. Why fork out the money for a domain when you can get free ones? Do you think so people need to expand their ego or some thing? Hmm. Maybe they just spend too much time on the net. (Well hey, I can't be bothered to pay for one.) Yeah, spending way too much time on the net is me! Why is it that I have like 50 people on my Msn list and the most boring people decide to come on? Ehe. I better go cause I need to do some thing...

      Where is every one? It's just me! Aargh! Any way every one's going into Bristol. I don't wanna cause it's cold and my ear hurts! Broadie woke me up today. He jumped on my bed and thudded around for a bit. He's getting really heavy! The only bad thing is if you move your foot under the covers he tries to jump on it! (Stupid cat) Then when he jumps off you hear this loud *thud!* Mmm he needs to go on a diet! Oh and Mango got a frog, ate it and left the legs! Whoops! Never a dull moment if you've got three cats! Heeey going back into relaxed mode. I'm a bit wierd actually (ya think?) listening to Lifehouse really relaxes me! It's like saying SUM41 put you to sleep. (Well they do with me!) They just sold out to pop, any way they're rubbish! My friend lovs them though and she's really excited that she's going to see them and it's like 'Umm whoo-hoo yeah, great...' So how is every one? What's every one doing? Mmm some one really should phone me cause I'm going crazy! It was hailing the other day and it covered the floor! Hmm it's too cold for school, lucky we got a week off. Recon we could go on strike?

      Hey! This guy was writing an article about blogs and he was saying how uninteresting and uninspiring they are! Well he hasn't been to this one! (This one can't spell too!) But seriously, who gets paid to write stuff like that and who reads it? *COUGH* Oh thanks...well I didn't know! Great, let's put down thousands of people woohoo! Grrreat going... Any way in the news today; Princess Margaret died! (And yes I did have to check how to spell Margaret!) It sounds like she's had a really depressing life though. I think we should all try to make other people's lives happier and longer. What's the point of being alive if you're not happy and every one around you is depressed? We should try to improve our lives by improving others. Oh yeah, I'm hearing you, I'll shut up now! Isn't it a bit wierd that Henry VIII set up the Church of England so he could get divorced but then royals can't marry divorcees? Some one has to look into this. And because of this some royals are depressed. It must be some thing to do with God wouldn't want it or some thing... Yeah great going, cut yourself off from the Catholic church so you can divorce some one then say you can't marry a divorced person because that's against god or something? Oh by the way, I'm not trying to offend any one I'm just saying that Henry VIII was a bit stupid. ...Maybe a bit more than a bit. Yes, I will shut up now! Have a happy day and think about the consequences. (By the way I can't hear out of my right ear at all today cause of this ear ache!)

      Hey. Sicky here. Well I'm still ill and my ear kills! I'm gonna go to school tomorrow. Well I have to hand in that options form thingy plus I lost the 'yes she can see the drama group' letter! Whoops! Heeey! I watched the Animal Show or whatever it's called. It's the Jim Henson thingy. It's sooo cool, I've watched it ever since I was little though. Okay so now you see what staying inside all the time does to you! One thing I'll never do in life is look at the inside of ears! Laura's against looking at feet though. They can be kind of gross. Hey does any one out there say gr-o-ss not grow-se. Erm guess not. How cold is it today?! Brrrr! Freezing. Oh, yeah, it would kind of help if I put the heating on... Whoopsie! The scary dustbin men came! So I kind of hid behind Mango. Great huh? Oh and I'm kind of working on a new page for this, but it's kind of tiring typing out all that HTML and no one else gets it! Hmmm....HTML lessons. Yeah, I'll need them! Oh thought for the day: I can't get wetter than this. Hey, that's more like a quote... Have fun you soaked people you. Yeah, just remember it's because I've been stuck inside...

      I'm happy today! Erm...don't know what about but I am! Happy with life. It's one of those sit-in-your-chair-and-go-ahh moments. Ahh. It's also one of those I-don't-know-what-to-talk-about-but-I'll-keep-going moments. Oh hey and umm did we have any hw? Apart from that massive piece of French where we have to write about French shops in a booklet. And the point is...? Any French teachers out there please come and kick ours out! She's rubbish! Even the dreaded prison lady Meunch is better than her. (And that's saying a lot!) How come on Msn you have loads of people and no one's online? :( I'm gonna go be happy some where else...some where like the Moon...stay with that thought! Toodles! Remember; Just because you can't see out of every one's eyes doesn't mean that they can't. Okay, so I've gone a bit wierd but so what? It's Monday and we haven't got school! Toodles (again) *sigh* I really should go...

But what they hey, I don't care any way. I'ld rather not be popular and have actual friends instead of having that embarassing silence and the false smiles. Wouldn't you? Any ways, my brother hacked into my MSN account! (Luckily I cleared it out a few days ago!) Cleared it of...nothing... Ehe, so any ways what are we doing on Friday cause we got nooo school!

I rememeber your brother when you were little, and every time i came round, you would have a fight over the T.V remote, and he always won! Ahhh happy days. It's fun being the older sibling, only that my little brother seriously does think that he knows everything so you have to bite your tounge a lot! Ok - big decision - SHOULD I GET MY HAIR CUT? I'm thinking of getting it cut short. and I mean short SHORT SHORT kinda short. Oooh! It reminds me of thet song - "I like short shorts, you like short shorts!" So yeah - ALL COMENTS WELCOME!!! AND WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE USE THE CHATBOX FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!???? Owww!! I have SERIOUSLY *hurt* (What would Moomin Moma say!) up my ankle. :( poo. it hurts every time i move it now. Oh well, i'll just hobble along. Wahoo! I have new trousers! Wooppee! Cos the other ones broke... um... in a kinda embarrasing place! So anyway... Oooh! look at that cloud! It looks like a racing car..... heh heh....

Well, apart from the fact the doors open, and you'll probably see my brother first and I'm listening to Pretty Women by a guy called Roy Orbison it's a sane house!

So he was swearing at me loads which makes me feel a whole lot better (not) and I almost started to cry. Great great great! :( Why does he always have a go at me?

      Hey. I'm not very happy today. My Grandpa's been taken into hospital. He's got really high blood pressure. He's got a history of high blood pressure but this must be really serious because he went in to hospital. Eugh. My Grandma and Nanny died, so I've only got my two Grandpa's. :( My Mum's gone up to see him. Oh, another thing, I have nits. Woohooo.... can life get worse? Eugh. I have to go try to comb them out now. I'm in a really bad mood now. My Mum can't help me cause she's gone to see Grandpa and I don't want her to be here, she should be there. Eugh. I think I'm going to explode.

      Oh and for the record, I don't smoke (any thing legal or illegal (I'm under 16 so it would be illegal!)), I don't drink and I don't do drugs! So if you're thinking otherwise... I just think cannabis should be legalised. I actually think that smoking should be banned instead of cannabis! What's wrong with that opinion? Ok so I'm stuck in moral rambling mode... I'll type a bit about fox hunting after this! (Oh whoopie I hear you scream in horror) Yeah, I'm mad. Must be Quasar effecting me!

      Druggies? Uhuh... You're a druggie then Lynne. You drink alcohol, which is a drug. You take paracetamol, which is a drug. Don't assume that people who take drugs are pond scum. Why shouldn't the druggies get it if it's legalised? Tobacco's leagalised, maybe the druggies shouldn't get tobacco. That's a drug. I researched it. I know what I'm doing. I think it should be legalised for every one! Peace out! For MS patients, people with cancer, people over the age of 16 who can smoke. People in our year smoke, why don't we go have a go at them? We don't because it's socially acceptable to us. So cannabis isn't? Why shouldn't it be, it actually helps you in some cases and it's just like smoking. Yeah, drinking messes up your liver but people still do it. People our age do so if you're gonna kill yourself through some drug or another why not do it through cannabis and keep the cigarette people happy. Unless you want to go smelling like smoke. What I'm saying is that cannabis isn't that bad, it's probably a tiny bit better than smoking because it has healing properties and even though it's a drug so's alcohol and that's legal so cannabis should be too. Druggies should get it. Heck, we're all druggies. We all drink at some point and some of us smoke.  urlLink http://www.overgrow.com  :) So legalise it already!

      i do think that in some cases canabis should be legalised because the scientist dudes just proved that it had healin powers and what not.  allthough sayin that i dont thinkm that the drugys should be able to get it if it got legalised.  i think that its a very touchey subject and the peeps that know what they are doing should deal with it!

      Okkk! I'm listening to System Of A Down - Legend Of Zelda! It's got the backround music of Zelda on it! Hehe... hehe... weird! Any way I was thinking about... cannabis! (Uhuh... really... and how long have you felt this way?) And we did a load of reasearch in it and I think it should be legalised! It's got some healing properties so in some ways it's better than smoking. Any way, we have alcohol and smoking, why not cannabis? If there is a legal way to get it (not through a dealer) then it can't lead you onto harder drugs because there wouldn't be a way of getting them. See where I'm coming from? Yeah, it gives you a high but so does Alcohol and smoking! Oh and all this stuff about brain damage... Yeah well they haven't really proven it! Geez I'm going a bit mad! One bad thing is that if it's got this white mold on it then it can really harm you... but legally that wouldn't happen would it? It should be legalised for MS patients though. My mum could of gone into a test where you try it out but then you wouldn't be able to drive so she didn't do it! In Glastonbury (Hey shoot me, I know my spelling sucks) we bought some cannabis seeds and because it was the seeds and you didn't smoke it the lady said that it didn't give you that bigger high and it was more on the medical properties. Mmm...bird seeds! My mum used it because she's got Multiple Schlerosis so it helped her. Any body else got any views? Wow, this is a nice brick wall I'm talking to. Okk so I should really get some music therapy!

      :(! Thanxs Lynne! Ooh nooo! I've only got 1hr 45mins to get ready! Eek! (I have to be ready about two hours early to keep me happy) I'm waiting for my Dad to get out of the shower. Ok... so I am a little bit obsessed with having a shower! Yeah, but isn't every one? It's a bit stupid really, cause all we're really doing is washing away our natural hair oils and those oils wash the hair naturally so it's a bit stupid! If you leave your hair for long enough it washes itself! Hmm, fascinating huh? (Nope!) Yeah... Eek, Quasar! I'm afraid that I'm gonna be rubbish at it and walk into mirrors like Emma did! Hehe, I'll be the person who's nattering away to themselves. Okay big thing: don't scream. That's like waving a white flag and shouting "YOOHOOO! OVER HERE!" Got it Laura? I'll probably be really jumpy though! I am when I'm all tensed up! Hehe... then afterward we're gonna eat then go see Ice Age! Cool! It's like totally adult scary thing followed by the stupidest kiddy film that we haven't watched yet! (Not that I err...watch those types of films (*IZZY*) Hmm...I better go do stuff!

Eugh, I always have hair washes. :( It's ok so long as the water isn't boiling hot or freezing cold which is kind of hard with our shower. Ohhh! I got locked out! My brother left me so I sat down and played with Mango then a paper boy came past so I ran inside the garage! Wow, highlife aye? I was ok though, we found coke (really scabby stuff you get at the dentist kind) and a pot of cadbury's chocolate spread so we had a few fingerfulls of that! Hehe, my mum's gonna open it up and half of it's gone! Hehehe! Ahh, I feel better now! My new shoes kill! I mean kill! They're pulling my feet inwards so I'll probably end up with totally deformed feet! Oh we're going to Scotland (madness, I know) over Easter for a week so I guess this'll be stuck with no one! "I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me!" Better not get Izzy started on that! I'm gonna go have a shower then I'll rub a tube of Anti-itchy cream into my scalp. It'll get in my hair though! Eww! Cream then wash? Hmm... wash'll wash out the cream! It's so hard! (I'll get my Mum to work it out!) Hehe! Eugh so bubi! If you're bored go to  urlLink http://kchan.cardcaptorz.com/  it's got cool links on it! (Sorry, I'm link girl!) OMG MY SCALP HURTS! Yeah...better go...bubi!

I usually go on link trails any way so it kind of helps! Oh and I found out (well remembered) that if you're on a nice layoutee site press F11 and it'll make the page fill the whole screen! Then press F11 to get out of it...I've done it before by accident and got kind of stuck! But err...you're cleverer than me...right? :(((( Every one's going on about FF10 and I don't even have a PS2! *sob sob* hmm you should see how long my amazon.co.uk wish list is! Hehehe... I probably shouldn't go into that by I love amazon! Hehe, I'm let loose with my Dad's credit card! Muhahahahaaa! (Don't you recon if we do a play of Macbeth we should turn to look at the camera and do this really deep Muhahaha! That would be really... really... funny!) Don't worry, I can picture it in my head... Oh, is that before or after we take over the world? Comments any one?

      ok i was watching this really deep phsycology programme, about how these people changed everyone's way of thinking - it was really scary!! they thought of people as crowds, not individuals, and by doing one simple action, they changed the way everyone thought! freaky huh? In 1910 is they sent 10 women out on the streets with cigarettes campaigning for Women's liberty, and soon, all the women in America start smoking! And they changed the world from a world where people own things and keep those same things for the rest of their lives, to a world where everyone wants new things all the time. Crazy huh? if they hadn't done that then we'd all probably be living the way they lived back in the 1940s, and there would be no such thing as mass production, pollution or global warming. wieeeeeeerd!! And the guy behind it all was Sigmund Freud's nephew, (you know, the famous phsycology guy) who got his ideas from reading his uncle's book! But the scary thing is, he didn't do it to try and make the world a better place, he did it purely for money and power. He manipulated the subconcious minds of thousands of people, like in batman or something! with the evil "Ahahaha i will take over the world" kind of baddie, but it actually worked, and people have only just realised it! Ok, i'll shuttup now! that was my deep phsycological rant of the day, bye bye!

      Life is about assumptions. We assume that we are going to be alive tomorrow, that our family and friends will be and we assume that we will eat. What happens when these assumptions disappear? What if we didn't know who would be alive or dead tommorow, is this the beginning of worrying and fear? (EH? Katie, what are you going on about?) Sorry, just testing out how deep I can go and how good my essay skills were. (*rubbish*) Yeah, I know! Just trying to make people think I guess. (People? What people?) Hmm... Ok, the other thing I was thinking about (well one out of about five thousand random thoughts inside my head) well it's that my Dad's a manager of a NHS hospital. Sure, every one's knocking down the NHS saying how rubbish it is, but in America if you don't have the cover for a operation you might not get it, you don't get the same care and people have to ask your insurers whether they can save your life or not. Hmm... This isn't like my moral mode. Well, I guess it is... I'm thinking about too much so I need to throw some stuff out to leave room for more stuff! (Eehhhhee... CRAZY) Badaboombadabing! I'm gonna go watch TV! Oh at school...hmm, nothing happened apart from this deep and meaningful play... aargh! they've achieved their goal and reached me! Noooo! They're one step closer to world domonation! (As I said, crazy, you really should of left it afer the deep and meaningful crap about assumptions) I agree.

Nah, sure, it was down to my admazingly clever skil... hmm, oh well, knew that it wouldn't work! Hey, I'm gonna be marked for life with that amazing-admazing thing! Oh and Mr Le Pen was saying how when the students were going on marches in the streets against him (back to the was saying) that their teachers were markist! (or whatever, the word that means when you kind of curve some one's thought and make them think that) *tootally lost!* That is totally wrong! Le Pen is a facist (whatever) racist git! And that's the best description I can give for him right now... hmm... Eek! I missed Neighbours, anyway, John's leaving Ally Mcbeal! :O :O :O Oh my god!!! He's the cool guy who every one sings to!

      Yeay! She shut up! Maths was sooo funny! Lynne was going on about periods (just Lynne! *COUGH*) Then our maths teacher told us to be quiet, and he had gone bright red and we were all like "Umm" and then we all started laughing! Hehe, that was fun. Ok, so either my eyes are screwed or this has a really small font... eek! Then we had practise science SATs and they weren't about any thing that we had done and I had to use my brains and memory to work them out! (And relying on my brain power and memory I didn't get very far!) Oook, so Shrek tune going on in here... eek wierd song. Kind of sad but then again tacky (promise me you won't go into any sort of review business) Ok.... It's Rufus Waintright - Hallelujah. Wierd guy... listen to the lyrics, that's the bad thing about pop, the lyrics are crap and don't mean any thing. Yeah, but we all know that don't we! Some one mad this song saying "I know all the songs are crap" and I'm like wooooh! Sorry, it's that time of the year and I either go hyper or depressed! (Uhuh...) Poor blob... I feel sorry for her, if you don't know who I'm talking about and you actually care try checking the archives.

I think my hormones are going crazy. I just want to say... I love you guys. All of you... but I HATE YOU!!! I want to be alone... Chocolate... Oh hi everyone!! Having a nice day!? Whoopeee!

So anyway, new word for today: foosies; means: when you get depressed about some one else and/or there problems. So wahay I'm wierd! Laura had the foosies today because some one was upset... well not really but we were being upset for her. Hmm, I think David has a thing for Lynne! Hehe! Today has been fun though yeah bit mad though! We made popcorn in tec and it was really nice! No one told me it was that easy to make! You just get a pot thingy (with a lit on) with a little bit of oil at the bottom, then you add a layer (1!) of dried corn and put the lid on over a mild heat (hey, that just sounds cool) and leave it until it stops popping and take the lid off and get hit in the eye with a piece of flying popcorn, then you get hit on the head by a giant piece of gold popcorn and some how end up in a wierd story type thing me and Sniz are writing! (Oooh, fun!) Hmm, guess it is nice knowing there are wierder people out there (if you mean you I take the as a compliment) Hey! Hmm... guess my other head is right... But seriously, we should all drink more ice! (Uhuh!)

        Sorry about my lack of blogs everyone, but I fell down a hole (you knew that was coming didnt you?) and uh.. into a crate full of um... pillows! yes! no - aromatherapy pillows! So, naturally, I fell asleep, blissfully unaware that the crate of aromatherapy pillows was to be shipped over to america and given to the astronaughts at NASA who needed special aromatherapy pillows to help them sleep while aboard their top secret mission to an un-charted planet billions of lightyears outside our solar system. Always the way isn't it?  Anyway, I awoke to find myself still inside the crate of aromatherapy pillows (ylang and sandalwood incase you were wondering) but i was no longer down the hole, i was crammed into a tiny closet inside a NASA spaceshuttle, and I realised that I must ecape from this unfortunate predicament before the astronaughts started to feel sleepy and in need of a ylang and sandalwood aromatherapy pillow! So I pulled out my handy little pocket-crowbar that i keep inside my sock and forced the door open.  But OH NO! (come on everyone, gasp like you mean it) aliens had taken over the space shuttle! They were purple and scary and had wooden spoons for ears! (oh no, not wooden spoons!) The crew were struggling to fend off these fowl creatures, but their superior NASA technology was no match for wooden spoons!   So I called on my good old trusty friend..... Magical Mucticoloured Moose! "Help us, Moosey!" I cried, walloping one of the aliens with an aromatherapy pillow, "The evil purple wooden-spoon aliens are trying to take over our space shuttle! If we let them, they will rule the world!" (Uh, how exactly does taking over the space shuttle give the aliens global dictatorship?) Er, carrying on...  "Never fear my little friend!" Said Magical Multicoloured Moose proudly, "For I have a cunning plan...." "Is it as cunning as a-" "Oh skip the routine!" Said Moosey,  and pulled  two multicloured space-hoppers out of his magical pink and green spotted top hat. "Quick, " he said, tossing me one and tossing his superman cape over his shoulder (superman cape???) "Throw it at the one with spoons for ears!" the fact that both aliens had spoons for ears made little difference.  The space-hoppers bounced abruptly off the aliens heads, and the aliends stopped trying to disembowel this shuttle commander and turned to look, in awe at these amazing multicoloured space hoppers.  And the Aliens played on the space hoppers all day long until it was time to go home for tea and me and moose and the crew all went home and we saved the world, the end.

Hmm... maybe if I cleaned my brain out I could swap it for a newer modle... uhoh slightly interesting thought, if you swapped brains with some one would you be the person in the other person's body or would you be the person in your body? ...Well I did say slightly interesting... Yeah, I am mad. Ooh, Have I Got News For You was sooo funny! Charlotte Church was good. She said to George W Bush that she came from Wales and he asked what state it was in! (Eek!) I think he needs to get out more...

      Kes why on earth do your blogs have to be soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long?   I was just wondering because mine are the total oposit to me; Short and sweet!!!  i think that im just going to talk poo now, right here goes...Can you remember on friday when we were telling Lucy she smells, well my mum found out and i had to send her an appologetic email saying how i diddn't mean it, and that i was being influenced by the people that i had round at that time.  Why is my life so unfair.  I think its true what they say *LIFES A B***H AND THEN YOU DIE!*  Did you all see have I got news for you on friday it was not that brilliant, and what was Charlotte Church wearing?

      So...hey! It's the national club of the bored people at home here! Woohoo! Hmm... what site to find, yes, I figured out where to use the word site! (Wow!) Must be like a miracle or some thing (please don't tell me what I spell wrong) Eek, SATs in less than a wekk. *groan* definatly a bad thing, all that pressure and testing all for the school that is super duper stupid! Oh, gross uninteresting fact, did you know that your hair is actually dead? Gross huh, so next time you give your hair the full works think about it, it freaked me out for a bit. Be cool if it was alive though! Like that lady on Mortal Kombat (the game on the sega (about 300 years old)) with the cool hair where she flips people with it and knocks them out! Ooh, that lady was cool, eugh I can't believe it, I've watched the movie, seen the cartoons and played the game. The game was actually a 18 cause of tiny splats of blood here and there... *cough* I think that Amelie could of been a 15 if they cut out 'those bits' cause they had nothing to do with the story and were randomly thrown in! Aww, Cleo's helping me... well she's kind of trying to rub the desk with her chin. My cats can get annoying though, they always want hugs and you can't do your homework around them cause they sit on your hand. Uhuh, I'm ramboling here (eek shoot me for spelling) I better go, if I actually think of some thing interesting for a change then you'll be the first to know!

      Hey guys, sorry I'm havin a really need to express imaginative ideas time, hmm, guess all that supression in art classes at school didn't do the trick. (Hmm...) We just watched Amelie, (or however you spell it) it's really good! Hehe, it's funny, but Laura had to fast forward through a bit of it. I realised some thing, people day dream wildly like me too. I mean, I seriously day dream, when i site there not saying any thing and kind of staring, I'm day dreaming, either that or I'm doing some serious thinking (probably about what to drink when I get home from school). Okay, so my life's boring, but it's fun to think "Wow I'm going to (fill in the gap)" today, it makes life a bit more livable and also it makes the day go faster :) But when have you done that thing that you've wanted to do, when does the point in your life come when you have nothing to look at and think "Wow, I'm going to do that" sorry, no clever answers today, because I haven't got any. Guess I'll just have to find out myself. Hmm, maybe it's called a mid-life crisis, personally I think it should be called a demi-semi-life crisis because it's sounds so much cooler and less like you're going round the bend. (Actually it sounds more, but I'm happy knowing that I'm right). Aren't we all? Huh, that didn't make sense at all! Oh well, guess that's what thinking to yourself is all about. Some one said that you know when you're mad when you start talking to yourself, so that means I'm about a mile past mad, but what happens when you start listening to other people talking to themselves? That's gotta deserve psychiatric treatment, but I guess that's what you're doing now, after all this is me, talking to myself, or it could be me talking to a white box. Yeah, I do think to much... guess I'm trying to jump start your moral and confusing thought drive, though I think it was probably jump started when you clicked on the link to get here. Welcome to my pink heaven. Where no one needs to know how to spell, and evey one day dreams themself to sleep. :) Wow, I actually managed to scare myself, guess I'm going a little bit too wierd, have fun every one and don't forget to shine!

      Hey guys! Or peeps... or things... or blobs from the planet Miscallaneous... who can't spell (my home planet incase you were wondering!) So every thing looks brighter now and hopefully people are happier! Ow, clicked my back, seem to do that a lot but I click my hips a lot more... wow full of useless information! Every one the best song is Private Eye by Alkaline Trio! It's so cool, oh and if you listen to the lyrics it's funny! Well, I find it funny, but I do have a scary mind. If people knew what I was thinking I think I might have a two mile radious! (Oooh, fancy!) Hehe, but yeah I think about how if the world flooded and all the houses had these cute flotation devices, then ours broke... uhuh, see my radious is getting bigger already! Oh, the radious thing, it's just that people site miles away from us in school so I always say that I have a one mile radious and every one stares at me and backs up a bit more! Fun! :) :) :)! Eek, my computer went a bit wierd, I think I'm typing too quickly so it freaked out! (Yeay, just the hoover left now!) Uhuh... Ok so hyper happy! Woohoo! Sorry, listening to ska! Who needs drugs when you've got ska! Ok, so that may sound like a drug but it's music! ...Anyway... oooh, um I found a cool spanish web site, ok so me and izzy found it! So you can look at it here  urlLink http://www.clubplaneta.com/cocina/huevos/receta15.htm   Then go here  urlLink http://babelfish.altavista.com/  to translate it, it's sooo funny! Or maybe it's just cause we were hyper at the time but oh well! :) Oh and I do put links up, those web pages are links but they aren't under lined! (Did any one know that any way?)

      Yeah people can be smelly. Its annoying how there always seems to be someone who a group of people decide to single out, and that person never seems to deserve it. Like with Emma.D -  CERTAIN PEOPLE  who will remain un-named are being tight to her for no reason, just becase she's kinda shy and can't stick up for herself too well. Aww well. Poor Flynnie, we're all your friends!! Lynne is cool. :D

My brothers going a bit loony cause he's gonna do a drama exam in a bit! (Eek!) And that involves dressing up in a top hat, a trench coat, and some other wierd clothes to look like a dad, but hey, my brother's mad! Yeah, every one is really but some people are better at hiding it! Heeey serious fast typing, uhuh. (You've had this up for half an hour and this is the crap you drop on the page?)

I think it's really mean, I always go and talk to people who are alone, why can't more people be like me? (AARGH!) Hey! I'm nice... some times... *evil grin* Hmm, but seriously, how can you all gang up on some one I would feel really bad if I did that. So pants to the people who are being mean to Lynne! Yeay! Hmm, but seriously (seriously? you???) Yeah, ignore the spelling, but any way... seriously we're here for you Lynne! (Technically I'm half here because some times my brain goes for walkies) Hmm, life is confusing isn't it? If it wasn't so confusing it wouldn't be fun! Just think about it... Maybe it's true! Well yeah... hmm now I'm thinking about it! (fell into your own trap) trap?!

Katie and Andys dads are being really mean, they wont let them stay together, when they love each other.  Its soooo sad.  The really bad thing is though, that Katie might be pregnant with Andys baby!!  Oh dear, me and my soaps.

      HELOOO! I'm actually on! My brother's been doing 'history GCSE corse work' so he's been on for a few days. :P So any way, hmm what happened, apart from me being a bit mad and exstatically happy! Oh, well guess I always am! Teee hoo haa haa! Sorry, just pure wow-i'm-on-blogger-ness! Uhuh... so any way, oh yeah Izzy's obsessed with Pete... ok so it might not be the whole truth but we like to bug her about it! (Sorry Izzy fans!) I had a funny day today, you know one where it dips and you feel sad then you go a bit mad. Oh, does any one else love that song that goes "I was walking along singing this song singing do wa didi didi dum didi dee!" Guess not... the singing lobster sings it! Ok, so now I sound wierder than normal! Eek getting thrown off, guess I'll write an interesting blog later!

      Eeeeeeekk!! We have the concert tonight!!! And the pieces sound.. erm... so good.... But hey!  We get to muck around backstage for hours and eat food! Playhouse concerts with North Somerset are sooooo much more fun, cause the playhouse is HUUUUUUGE and it has loads of stairs!!! Wow. Fun. Actually everything about North Somerset Orchestra is better than School Orchestra. Its more fun, the pieces are easier, sound better, the conducters are actually better than Mr.K, you get a break when you can buy food and sweeties etc!!! And you get to meet loads of people! Its just down right cool! ("down right" where did that come from?) And Mr.K insists that school is better! Pah! (Dont tell him about this; the very mention of North Somerset Orchestra was enough to get him shouting at me!)

      Wow! I'm back! Geez yeah, my brother's been on all day! Grr... Thanks to the girl with no name... yeaaaah! I've gone all creative! ..Wow... my parents are going out, hmm what to do? (*evil laugh*) Ahaaah! Be afraid, I'm having a mad creative moment but erm sadly I used it all up on my essay. :( Sad huh, yeah! Oh, and the bird died, and Mango got another one today plus another shrew thing! He's a murderer! It is pretty awful but then again it is natural (yep still creative and motionlessly droning) wow, is that a real word? Isn't it droaning? Hmm, I dunno. (Grrr) Ooook, so I'm really scared cause I'm listening to a really really scary song... eeek! Sorry, I have this up for about half an hour before I actually post it! Ahh... I pressed stop, so much better! How cool, I'm reading a story and it has 1. Defult Chapter 2. Chapter 2 3. The chapter after chapter 2. I mean, wow, I am going a bit wierd aren't I? Ohhh, we had this cool idea for a after SATs party (shoot us we're bored) and we could do a pinyatata! (pinyata shoot me too I can't spell it!) Can any one? Any way, we were gonna make one of those big things that you hit, uhuh, (?) and we were gonna make it look like a teacher so we could whack it! (Hmm I could see myself getting a little bit too excited) and we could either put cool stuff in it (FOOD!) or fill it with water ballons because... I care about this world (really moving music) sorry I'm stuck in the movies. I always say that, wouldn't that be perfect in a movie. Yup, wierd as hell. I better go record Star Trek for my mum otherwise I won't be here tomorrow! Bubi!

      Hey. I'm depressed now, yeah I am listening to depressing music but it's not that. My cats got a bird, it's not dead, it's in our garage but we phoned the RSPCA and they said they didn't have enough room and they think we should take it to our vet for the 'kindest option' (to be put down) my dad's getting really protective though and he was saying that we could look after it, but the RSPCA don't suggest that because then it becomes tame and also it needs to be fed every two hours. Herum. How small our problems are compared to that of the world. Sorry, I just got thinking. Some times we make problems out of nothing, just for the fuss. I guess I realise that and try not to do it. (*yawn*) Hey! This isn't boring this is deep man! (sorry... *smaller yawn*) Yeay, well some one got on this from mine and Izzy's profiles! (Two people did) which is really really scary! Oh, and sorry but I can't be bothered to go on a editing spree who ever you are! (for no reason at all... nope...) Ok, so every one here is depressed I better go! Bubi!

      Do you really need to be drunk to have fun? Can't you just be happy with yourself? If you're happy already then why do you need drink to be happier? If you're fun then why use drugs? Insecurity I guess. Must be some thing to do with how you don't think other people think you are nice and you need to get smashed to know that. (shut up!) Sorry moral ramblings day! Les personnes intelligentes n'ont pas besoin de dire d'autres qu'elles sont intelligentes. (uhuh!) Hey what can I say I'm going hyper talking to Izzy and I'm bored! Ooh, I went to Ikea and now I love that store! My rooms going bright pink and I got these pink pillow cover things... yeay! My last covers I've had for about ten years! We got a load of groovy stuff too! Yeay! Oh and we did know about the big vegetable cause we told you, it's a french phrase like our big cheese thingy. I love Ikea! Sorry, did I forget to say that? :P I'm gonna go, bro's doing drama (GCSE stuff) plus I've got a few jobs and we're gonna make orange ice-lollys! YEAY! Sorry I'm really excited! Woohoo! Bubi!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       urlLink  Heloooooooo! I'm a bit confused now, doesn't take a lot! I went on a watching tv thing today, I watched Yu-Gi-Oh and it was all speechy and we're all friends and I'm even more confused, like in Saved by the Bell where they all get together at the end and admit how they were all selfish and stuff and it's like forget that! burn the school! Uhuh... Yeah, tiredness? no, wierdness? definatly. I've been doing reading too at  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net  cause I'm really bored and I need some thing to do! Oh, we're gonna go get Amelie (shoot me for trying to spell it) yeay! (I need to watch a film!) Plus popcorn, which Izzy is a bit obsessed with. Oh! Big news! They aren't gonna do any new Ally Mcbeal's cause the ratings are dropping in america! :( :( :( They dropped Due South cause of that too! Grr... *mumbles* but, Calista (shoot me twise why don't you) Flockheart (Ally (oh, just shoot!)) Is a bit thin, ok so she's like a stick! They were saying in the paper that they all have eating problems or some thing... In my opinion they should drop Friends and keep Ally! (Yeay!) But... they're still showing Eastenders so maybe I'm losing on the tv thing. Yeah, yesterdays was overdramaticly funny! The actors are sooo rubbish! (The jury were!) They found her guilty! :O Have I got News for You was reallly good! I laugh out loud at that programme, which is kind of rare. Do you say lol and lol? I don't! See, wierdness. I'm gonna go mope cause no one else is blogging! Bubi!

      YARRRGH! Nothing to report, apart from my last two blogs that I exited instead of posting! (doh!) God, that's annoying... must... post... So any hoo in my last non-existant post I was talking about how scary Neighbours is, what's with the credits? It's really freaky! And what's Rosie doing in the credits? She's been in it like three times! Laura said she might have a fling with Lou! Geez that would be scary! Is it Geez or Geeze? Hmm... Neighbours is light compared to Eastenders, in Neighbours some one gets hit by a car and gets mild concusion but in Eastenders if some one gets hit by a car, even the slightest bumb they drop down dead. Aparantly no one in Australia likes it... Ooh, and Flick's gonna leave I think! But Marc isn't in the credits so will he mary Steph? I could talk about Neighbours all day... oook... I'll leave! :( :( :( Oh, and Thank Bob it's Friday! Oh, Have I got News for You is on tonight at 9pm, so is Father Ted, but Have I got News for You is soooo much better than Father Ted plus it's new! *tapes Lynne and Laura up with tape and throws them in a swimming pool so they can't say any thing!* Hehe... still wierd and kicking! Woohooo!

      Hey! Sorry, I went a bit, I was thinking about how to be a good evil villan (if you get what I mean) hmm, here's some general rules: 1. Never ever tell your enemy just before your about to kill them what you plan to do next. 2. Get  evil laugh sorted out, and hire a guy to follow you around with a black screen just incase he needs to put it behind you for evilness. 3. Get a cool evil base sorted out, but not some where odvious that has a big illuminous sign saying "evil person here" cause I've got that already. 4. Always have a good evil plan, and uh why am I doing this again? Guess I've been playing on Monkey Island too much! And hey, do you have to pay for kazaa? cause we aren't (hmm bro must of got a hack!) Hehe, well today was pretty mad, well ok, very mad! I think our 1 mile radious might of extended to 2 by now! I'm gonna go play on Monkey Island bubi! Download it off KaZaA!

I've been on a Monkey Island 2 playing spree! Hehe, I found a walk through, ok, ok, so I'm cheating but what can I say? I'm rubbish at it!  urlLink http://members.aol.com/gametown/monkey.html  Heehee! Oh, if you didn't know, you can download it of KaZaA hey, you'll probably end up nicking it from us!

      What the? I think my hotmail's gone a bit funny, it says I'm almost out of extra storage space so I went on a deleting spree and it hasn't changed! Err, any one wanna buy me some extra storage space? :| Wow, kind of duck like. Aww, poor Emma really hurt her arm and leg and every one got back from Spain! (yeay!) Herum. I think the red storage bar just went up!? Queer! Oh and say herum, it's not a actual word. Oh, and Izzy found a wierd and wonderful list of our words that we've made up! (cool!) Izzy, you have to put them on this! Hmm, is Becki coming on? She hasn't so far and I need more blogging people! Hmm... wierd, I just got a e-mail about submitting this to a load of sites for money? Do we want people to purposely come on this? No, I'ld rather they'ld trip over this! (What's with the 'ld) And as many times as people would search for saneasakitten, I think I'm alright! ;) Hmm... maybe that's what was taking up all the space! (hope so otherwise you're doomed!) Mmm... I feel a sudden Monkey Island urge, even though I'm stuck! I can't find the fort on Monkey Island! Can some one help me out, yeah I'm a bit fo a dingbat I know! (wow, dingbats are cool!) Hmm... we should all sing more! (You're just plain mad) Is there a plain mad, and how come if I'm a three headed monkey I only have two heads... (the other one's asleep look to you're left) AAARGH!

Hmm, why does every one still believe in perfection, nothing is perfect and if it claims to be perfect then it's telling a lie therefore it isn't perfect. WAKE UP! Sorry, got that off my brothers media project which is really funny! :) :) :) You should watch it some time! (uhh.... yeah...) I'm off to play Monkey Island! Oh, if you want me to blog more, just send hate mail to my brother! :) On second thoughts maybe not!

      Eugh, don't you think that Ariel Sharon is such a fucking bastard? I do! He's really twisted and he shouldn't be killing all those Palistinians (sorry don't know how to spell it) some one needs to kick him hard in the ass other wise his ego might expand so much that it'll smuther the world. Sorry, I'm deep today. I just hate how people are dieing and I can't do any thing to help, I hate it how Ariel Sharon doesn't even want to stop killing them. I don't understand it, and I don't think I want to! Ok, I'm going to sleep now, bubiiiiii!

I think he ate it, I dunno, I came inside and when I went back out it wasn't there *shivers*. Eew, that's gross. Stupid Mango! He caught it just when I was putting out the cat food.

      They're English? Uhh... most of them are that we know. Why? Maybe it's got some thing to do with being in England? Sorry, I'm in a bad mood. Some one typed some thing about giving out chocolate bunnies and i said wow dark or white chocolate and some one called me wierd. I do mind I guess cause they don't know me and they sounded like they were saying it meanly. It is really mean to judge some one before you know them or any thing about them, and it just makes me really angry when people do. Hmm, is it me or is there no such thing as perfect health? I'm always ill! I mean like uhh kind of ow my leg then ow my ear type thingy. Yeah, I need to talk to some one! I'm getting too angry! That's why the quiet one's are evil, they never share there feelings and some times they don't know how to (might sound wierd but some people do find it hard!) so they blow. Yeah, I'll run back to my hole now.

I'm getting kinda attatched to them, i was sitting on the grass with Ying and having a good old chat with her, and I'm sure she was listening to me! She does what Russell does and sits there looking at me strangely and twitching her nose! Awww!!! But it was scary cos the neighbour's cat was trying toget into their run!!! and they were skeaking and they were really scared! AWWW!!! But I came to the rescue and the cat ran away. Ha! I had erm, lots of fun cleaning them out this morning, you would not believe how many poos they do!

      Hmm, found a nice site  urlLink http://astro-pop.net/hannah/  but if you go to the main bit  urlLink http://astro-pop.net/  then you see this thing, the person's not coming on the internet any more, some thing about losing her life...? I guess you do in a way, but you also gain a lot, you may stay inside for a bit but you meet new friends on the net and probably have a lot more than you would if you walked out on to the street and said "Hey! Be my friend!" That actually works on the net, and on the net no one (some sickos do) cares about what you look like and how rich you are. Comments any one?

Mmm... but why would any one do that? Maybe she's jelous and she wants to get back at her or some thing cause she's out friend... (????) Don't worry, it makes sense in my head! (Every thing makes sense in your head!) Hehe, oh and on the Sims we got all the people we didn't like and put them in the Sims! Katie Vile turned into a zombie and got set on fire... happy memories... Hehe, sorry but it's fun to kill people on the Sims!

Ok so he's leaving! Every one's out apart from me... scary... ohh, I'm thinking out loud, sorry! (Eeek, way too scary.) And hell yeah, that RE lesson was soooo scary! With this freaky Italian film that was trying sooo hard to be funny, and it kind of was but no one was laughing! Wasn't it called Life's Beautiful or some thing like that in Italian...? It had nothing to do with RE at all! Ok, so Jane Austin? Getting in touch with your feminine side aye? But seriously, she is good! I go to FFOnline too! It's cool!

      Just thinking. (Dangerous!) Thanks! :O! Any way, this song, Semisonic - Secret Smile listen to it, it's good, any way it's going on about how 'you've got a secret smile' and don't you think that? Well I do, whatever's inside my head, all my thoughts are mine and no one will truely know your thoughts. I guess when it comes down to it, it's the last bit of privacy we have, and it's locked inside our head. Nothing can read or decifer the code of though. Geez, bit heavy there! Sorry, just a bit moral.... and crazy! ...It was Laura! Hehe, blame Laura for every thing great! Grrr... my ear keeps going and I say that 'I can turn it off' cause it I press it then I can't hear any thing and it shuts out every one's annoying fake laughing! Hallelujah!

      Hey if you want a free message board thingy then go to  urlLink http://www.ezboard.com  I might bother to get one but heeey it would be funny, it'ld be like a blog in a board... (Yeah... whatever you say...) Wait a minute, I'm home alone, and all the food's downstairs... alone... WHAT?! What am I doing up here? I'm gonna go raid the kitchen! But seriously (?) would any one apart from us use it? Who's mad enough? (Geez... I could count a few people) And, question of the year: Does any one actually get our humour? Usually they just ignore us or do fake laughs *shivers* eugh, I hate fake laughs!

I actually have a party plan now! Hey I have to go bug people about it. I have a theory, Izzy isn't coming on this so I won't bug her about Mr Fopple! Yeah, ok, so I suck with theories! Geez, why do we want to know about cubism again? What is it? Greeeat, reminds me of french, we spend a whole lesson doing stuff that we don't know any thing about... yeah... that makes no sense! But any way! Oh, every one remember Russian tomorrow, damn got Russian homework too! Dosvedanyaa or however you say it. Hey has any one found Russian character thingies on the computer? Tell me if you have! Did you see Neighbours Laura? Talk about :O :O :O

      heloo just seeing if this works. okay well hmmmm.. today was okay, got my va va voom back (well most of it) did a lot of punching the punch bag when i got home (not for any particular reason) however it is a great way to take out anger by pretending it's certain peoples heads who happen to be complete bitches.(i'm sure u all no who i mean) for those who don't then just be thankful. today is wednesday.... i think. which is kinda cool cos we have art tommorow (yey!!!!!!!!!) i'm not very good with days of the week. as u can probably tell. bye then see u soon p.s. i hope u did not get lost lynne!

But damn it, we've got Art homework. :( Hehe, I've got this inbuilt thingy where I can totally ignore people and I'm trying it out on Rosie, not that she'll notice, and not that I care. Any way, on the point of two mile radiuses (who mentioned that?) as I was saying, no one gets our humour! Seriously! They either go uhuh, or run away scared! Ooooh, fun! Or pretend to which is even funner! So ok, I have to plan my party! Yeah... we could kill Izzy! Uhuh... or we could just go and see a movie. SPIDERMAN?! Yeah! Or just have another water party! Yeay! But the thing is, only rooom for 7 in a car... and 5 people including you lot so who else? I wanna have three heads the day after I give out the invitations you know! Oh and MR FOPPLE! Hurrrrrrrrrrrry up!

Oh, and Laura, you can stay in the spare room. :P :P :P Just that Laura's oh-so slightly obsessed with PS2's and don't ask about the weird language going on here! Aaargh, hotmail won't lemme check ma mail! Meanie! Hey izzy finished Mr Fopple yet? That is a mad story, isn't it? Music for today is John Mayor - Neon you should listen to it, it's light and it's got a load of guitar in it, with actual music not just chords! :O :O :O Shock horror I know!

      *FAME I WANNA LIVE FOREVER, I WANNA LEARN HOW TO FLY, FAME!*  I think you get the general gist of it now.  It was soo good!  It was really sad aswell becasue there was a girl called Carman and she got hooked on drugs and her boyfriend gave her some money not knowing what it was for and hse ended up killing herself.  Then at the end the all the audience stood upand started dancing!!

      Ok - Rosie analysis - she wants attention and something to brag about, she's decided that she doesn't like us and is trying desperately to find something wrong with us. She can't, so she's making it look like we've done something to give her a reason for doing something and getting attention! (phew!) Doing anything back to her is not a good idea (but a repeat of the baked-beans-over-the-head-inceddent would be funny!) because it will show her that we care which we DON'T! And it will give her the attention that she wants, and will only encourage her to do it more. If she thinks it's really cool and that she looks really smart then hell, let her! She'll grow up sooner or later and realise how stupid she's being! Ok, that's the end of my Kilroy impression, sorry about that! Anywayyyyyyy... eeek got a load of savage monsters i mean, uh... you guys coming round tomorrow...it's gonna be hectic cause my Grandma will have just arrived and it'll be like "Uh... Hi, er -talk later...*smuggles Lynne out the way before she says something stupid*"

      Yeah! Every one should support this Cancer Week thingy! And hey, you don't have a choice. 1 in 3 people get cancer, Nanny had it and so did my brother. Sadly Nanny died from it. :( Hmm, I'm surrounded by too much death. AAARGH! Sorry, just saw the Pete thing on flooble, god it was you Lynne? You just gave me a heart attack! Oh, my computers really mucked up! Every thing's too big, even web pages! 1 in 5 computers have a virus! Annoyed yet? (I am!) Thank you Lynne for being so kind to me! ...Although I'm not sure that I want all my readers to cry when they read my poems, guess I can express emotions through them so it's a good thing! ...in a way...! Oooh, Pretty Women! This song is sooo annoying. Did you know that they made an Abba play? Abba are anchient, can't people let them go? My mum and dad didn't like them 30 years ago so why would they like them now?! Oh, and Izzy phone me about tomorrow! Oh, and what Rosie did actual made me feel better and more secure about myself SO HA ROSIE SUCK ON THAT! *Ahem* Sorry, it's just I accidentally shoved my table a little bit into her and she shoved me and said "God fuck off Katie!" And :O Talk about unprovoked attack! Hehe... now that I think about it, damn why didn't I hit her?! I could of said it was self defence! Muhaha, have to remember that! Mmm... plate of baked beans in order or shall I just stick with custard? Heeey, I'm joking, I'm chilled really! Oh and I think we need to see Blob tomorrow, she seemed more depressed than usual. :( Poor Blob...

I think that you could become a really famous author, because your story and poems are really good!  GRRRRR Mrs Smith back 2morrow, not good news, back 2 boring lessons not having a clue what I'm doing, o well.  I have run out of things to say so I might just go to bed and read for an hour or two, o well.  oooooo I keep on saying o well, o well.  I'm going to do it deliberatly now.  o tumty tum tum, I have a head ache.  do u no that tomorrow or today whenever u nxt read this so basicly 23rd May to the 3rd June is National bandana week for the teenage cancer trust, so Laura and I are going to buy ourselves a bandana each.  I am definatly going to because if there was a unit for it in The Bristol Childrens hospital the girl across from Letty could be in it with people going through what shes going through.  If you see what I mean.  so wear your bandana with pride.  They cost £5 and u can get them in Pilot, Topshop, Tie rack and Im not sure where elseu can get them.  wow ive ritten quite a lot 4 me.

Like the time that me and Izzy were hiding from every one in camp and we managed to kick a load of wood ants and shout to the other team that "There's no one here!" Haha, that was funny. Yeah, I'm crap at telling stuff! Mmm... well old stories that happened, heck, any stories! So Blob is feeling better! (Was she called Blob? I forgot) Well I think she is, which is good! Yeay! Oh and Lynne's mad... oh and it's raining loads! It's really sad, I was watching spooks and apart from some one dieing horrible, this racist barstard (sorry guys!) was on it and I was like "Ooooh, I'm gonna kill him" I hate prejudice, it's all about feeling that you're better than some one for some reason or other and it really pisses me off! So does some one threatening me with violence. Funny, some one shouts at me and I ignore them, then they threaten to punch me and all of a sudden I start screaming at them and go off in a huff! (Geez, you're weird!) Hey, I better go, Rik's doing his GCSE's and he wants a go so bubi!

Yeay! It's my birthday soon! Woooohooo! Aargh, we had a french test and I pinged Izzy's bracelet and it went by Megan, then the teacher picked it up and Megan said it was hers and she said that she had been looking for it for ages! Liar! Then Rosie was like, I got 16 I must be cleverer than you. But they all cheated and copied each other, and is it me or do I sound really kiddy today? I'm gonna go disappear in a florish of moralness!

Gag her and put her in a.. in a.. uh - a sack! With uh.. handcuffs - anything!!  Have you seen the Esso boycott? There were greenpeace people putting up signs saying "Dont buy from Esso" etc, and handing out anti-Esso leaflets, which I was reading and finding out how evil Esso actually are. Brendan got a badge from them saying "I don't buy from Esso" ! Yeah... he buys from Shell instead!

      Arghh! I was tres agreee (dunno just trying to sound french) earlier - and i have some inspiration for something to write on fanfiction - Yay!! If they actually send me the email! I lost the old ones so i have a new pen-name (hopefully) now. Hahahaaaa! twas funny, mum forgot to clean out Russell's cage, and left it a couple of days later than normal, and we found the Russell had chewed a huge hole right through the plastic in protest!! If he had chewed any longer it would have been big enough for him to get through! He is not a normal hampster. He is too smart for his own good! He can stear a hampster ball  perfectly  around corners and he knows his way around everywhere! He knows that if he has no food left in his bowl, and we're all in the kitchen, if he hangs from the bars of the top of his cage, we'll notice him and notice that his food bowl's empty! Weird, but smart....perhaps...to smart.

Eugh, people at school want me to give them the addy for this, is it ok for people to reading your sort of journal thingy? I guess if they do then they'll be even more wierded out than usual! Muhahahaha! Fun! Hehe, Lifehouse song says "Finding my way back to sanity, although I don't know what I'm gonna do when I get their." How cool! It's called Breathing so go out and download it or some thing! Mmm... back to the thoughts thing, I mean, it's seriously gotta be bad for you're health to read my mindless blog rambles each day, or ever! must decrease brain cell multiplication!

Ahhh perfect moment - As soon as we get into school we're greeted with the site of Lisa Boden screaming because she's covered from head to foot in foam! We managed to catch a few simple phrases like "My hair!" and "Eeeeek!" and "Rick Sims!" Twas funny.  Eeek Russian was scary. All these weird letters! The teacher was cool, but its hard! It was funny cause Mr.Wiltshire was supposed to be listening to the teacher and writing stuff down like we all were, but instead he was talking and giggling and playing with his pen and doodling on his book! Then he scrunched his paper up into  ball and started playing with it! I thought we were supposed to be the kids!

(Oh a breath in piece is where you can actually stop for a minute! Aaargh! But it sounds good and it's fun so it's worth it! Hmm... I think by the end of tomorrow I might need some beer, my brother's gonna have super soakers! (EEEK!) Hehe... I'll just scream and run, we've gone through this before haven't we?

Don't worry, I'll just use Izzy as a shield! Muhahaha! Ok, so moral blogging! Katie Vile is being mean! So smeg to her! We all support you Lynne, and we will in any way that we can so we're here and uhh... yeah... Well, her last name is Vile isn't it! I recon the people around her don't actually like her and are just afraid of her and that's the only way she can get friends... kind of gotta feel sorry for her no? In a way... A very small way... Gomen, I know! I'll shut up soon! Eek! Eugh, don't get me started on smoking... sorry, some one on msn has 'give me some money for fags' as there name. If you want to kill yourself by smoking, go ahead and do it. Slow suicide, not very nice at all.

      Eeek Lynne overload! Okay, so you know that I said that my life was boring... in a kind of way, well that changed yesterday! *breathes in* (it's good to do that every once in a while) Weeeel! My cat, Brodie managed to get himself covered in kerine (?) the painty stuff so we had to give him a wash! It was really hard cause we were kind of doing in on the table and he kicked the bowl of water over so I got a load of keriney water over my trousers! (I think I've got it out but they still stink a bit!) So then my mum phoned the fet and guess what? Wow, that's right! The vet said we had to cover him in margarine! So we did and we got it every where and he kept trying to bolt! Aww, he looked soooo pathetic! Then I had to keep him from doing anything for ten minutes! It was hell and by the end of it I was covered in margarine too! You wouldn't believe how hard it is to stop a cat from eating the margarine it's covered in! Then we had to wash him again so we got him in a head lock and tried to wash him in the sink! He's still covered a bit, and his hair's all manky! Eww, but he stinks of fat and it's all gross! Hey, that actually happened!

(Uh oh I just sounded like my grandma) I don't actually have any major probs right now. Thats admazing too. Ok I've given up trying to type and restrain russell's wild instinct, so i'll just let him roam free throught mum's room. *Sings* Born freeee... Free as the wind blows...Free as the grass grows....

Well, admazing but my life's ok at the moment... I guess... hmm, just waiting for some thing. Check on me in a year, it'll probably be hell!

      Hey! Isn't it annoying when your toe gets stuck to the carpet? ...Eww... gross! Any way eek! EEK! Next Thursday will be my brother's official last day of school! AARGH! Umm, I think I'm gonna run away on that day cause otherwise I'm gonna end up getting covered in flour or something... help! Mmm, plus he's being rebeleous (at least I attempted to spell it!) and he's going to the ball wearing a kaftan instead of a suit! HA TAKE THAT! Sorry, just all the girls are really vane and like "You've gotta make and effort. Oh and cut your hair!" I would never say that to anyone! It's just tight and obnoxious! Yeah, but I'm afraid of what he's gonna do on Thursday! Oh, the ball's at a really posh place, and I can't see them getting drunk there! Although... Hmm, wonder who his date'll be... maybe I should stop wandering! Eeek, dead scary thought! Aargh, I'm going back to my hole! I need a vacation!

      Hey. I'm listening to relaxing music, I can only take so much rock music you know! Kind of get a head ache, any way! Enya are officially relaxing! So's Life House, but any way! Ahh, I love being relaxed cause usually I'm really jumpy! If you say "Boo" behind me I'll probably jump about two feet into the air. It's cause of my brother... and scary Doctor Who movies! Eeek! I'm gonna go, getting kickem offem again! (I have a thing about em after words...) Never mind, just my strange little world I guess.

      Here's my plan: First we boycott Mcdonal'ds, then we buy a dictionary so I can actually spell things correctly! (Hallelujah!) *don't start* Then we get a big piece of popcorn and we get a pink giraffe to eat it and then it blows up like a balloon. We send it to the White House and the oh so clever George Bush thinks it's an alien and decided to pop it and eat it. Little does he know that the pink giraffe has also eaten a chemical that makes you believe whatever some one tells you. So George, being the good guy that he is gobbles it all down and then we burst into his office and tell him he's a monkey. So he wanders off, acting like a monkey and the whole world gets thrown into turmoil becuase the pink giraffe turns out to actually be an alien, a blue one. So we jump in and claim we're aliens too and take over the Earth! Good eh? Sorry, majorly bored! Eugh, gotta go do something! Bisi! Hehe... shopping on  urlLink amazon ? Sounds good to me! :) :) :)

I should get it for my dad, you should get it for your's too! Who knows... maybe it'll put them off golf! Not likely, they're ultra weird dad's (like the rest of them) and oh-so slightly obsessed with golf. See! Obsessed! I told you! (shut up katie) :( I can't believe it, my own head telling me to shut up. Hmm.. that sounds wierd and confusing, maybe I should shut up... Eugh, I was having a hard time in SATs trying to remember how to spell maybe! Guess the stress got to me... that is right, isn't it? M-a-y-b-e not d-e-f-i-n-a-t-l-y-n-o-t yup, stress I tell you stressss! Mmm, wasn't I saying about eating more cheese ages ago? Well... it's time to eat more ...wait a sec while 'inspiration' hits... ... ... OW! tomato puree! Yeay! (I'm sure it's got a dash on the e somewhere!) Hey I'm going all french! Yeay! Happy hyper! Woohoo! I better go now before I scare myself! Bubi!

      Hey! Just thinking about obsession, and how I always get obsessed by something, no one notices though! (Teehee) Isn't it healthy to have an obsession? To have some thing that you're constantly thinking about? Hmm, I just phrased that really badly so I gues it isn't. Otherwise my brain wonders though... hmm... Every one's always obsessed with some thing or at least I am! Mmm hmm... *COUGH* (shut up katie!) EDITED. Sorry, but I value my life. Geez, they make it seem like being best friends is like being joined at the hip! Wheras Izzy and Minton are joined by the little finger and me and Mr Fopple are joined by our ankles (it would really help if I could remember how to spell that) Oh and no thinking about that peeps, especially Laura, we know her twisted mind! Mmm.. I'm gonna go watch HIGNFY!

      Wow, I just got an email saying that if I sent it on I would get money because Bill Gates is sharing his fortune. Ha, that'll be the day. All these rich people sit at home flooded with money while their is always some person out their with no money and probably close to death. Probably having a disease that could be easily cured if the right medicene was administered to them. If I ever am rich *COUGH* then I'll do a load of charity work and stuff! Yeay! And of course I'll buy Sandwhich Island or some thing stupid. So many people to help and so little time. Don't worry Izzy if I become a psychiatrist you can be my first patient. :D Oh wait, my Dad's first sorry. Going a bit weird today... (just a bit?) Hey I'll upload the third Mr Fopple chapter!

      That was sooo fun! Sorry Laura, I just wanted to go! We got a load of strange people to talk to us and muck around! Oh yeah, then we kind of attacked people with water. :D I think Laura has some thing against capital letters! Hehe Kim got so covered in water today, she got totally soaked and her hair got all wet! No one stopped throwing water at her and people went away and refilled their bottles and came back! Hehe, then she rubbed her hair on us and her hair dye came out on our clothes! Meanie Kim! But it was fun cause we got loads of people, and we got a load of people to join in with drenching Kim and people talked to us. Ok, so the point being: we joined all the 'loners' into one big group of 'loners' making us the sad group! YEAY! I like being nice to people what's the point in being horrible? Mmm... Yeay Bristol's gonna be fun! Woohoo we have our strange group ready and we can go buy plastic swords and freak every one out! Fun! Oooh sorry about the nicking your shoes thing Laura... but it was fun! Hehe and we took Izzy's as well! You actually got them back in the end though, well err after about half an hour of pratting about! Yeah I guess Tasha was supposed to do the high jump, PROUD TO BE LAST IN SPORTS DAY! Damn it we're good! My plan in life is not to shut people out but to let people in, in my opinion any one can be my friend and join our little 'gang' and I always want to eb that way. I will never be picky about my friends and I will always welcome friendship! (Moral rant over, you can breathe now).

Your trust on your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it, if that trust is ever broken.  21 TO 30 POINTS: Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It would really surprise them if you ever did something impulsive or on the spur Of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.  UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything. They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.

      Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical and always interesting, someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, a little too generous at times, and understanding; Someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out. Aren't I just perfect? :) :) :) (NO!)

      Rite I have tryed translating it and i think he is insulting our website, becasue it looks like from what i have been doing that these languages:  french, Spanish, Italian and portuguese that they all have the word 'made' in them and/or bad and poorly.  So i think that he is trying to say that our website was either made badly or made poorly.  But then again I may be wrong.  Dancing was great fun.  inearly wet myself, but anyway.  Did you have fun in Peterborough katie??????????????

      Hehe, sorry about that! I just got back from Peterborough today! Yeay! I saw my cousins that I haven't seen for three years and I probably won't see for another three! Aww! I get to see them on Tuesday though, but I still have to go to school! (Soooo unfair!) Hey Emma got the day off to get her dog!!! Ok, so err going into the mall or bristol yesterday sounded like fun... even though I don't get at all what happened! Hehe, and we have weird people viewing our website... wow their are weird people out their apart from us! (What's up with there and their? Aaargh it drives me crazy!) Oook... so I translated the French persons comments and it came out as this:  : The mede have ger semi stake have badly? Woohoo! Ahhh... FREAK OUT! So that was either a French person who said some thing in French and it comes out as crap in English who thought they would write it on a English web site... or a very confused Dutchman. Hmm... tough choice!

      Mmm slightly mucked it up then! *Yelps!* Hey, I figured it out, when you're 'popular' then you have to move around friends but when you're not you stick to friends! Ok, ok, so that's a crap excuse for us being sad and unpopular! But hey I'd rather be like this! I don't want to turn into a slut! Seriously though, all the popular (crap I can't spell that!) girls are realllly slutty and flirty! Aaargh! Scary! Plus then we'd actually have to try to be 'cool'! Eek, I'm happy being chilly thank you very much! ;) ;P :) (Weeeeird girl!) Hmm... I'm just happy being sad! Oh yeah, it is annoying when people walk around like they own the place and like they aren't being your friend because  they  don't want to be your friend! Aaaargh it makes me wanna hit Laura! (Hehe, only joking!) Hmm.... maybe I do need a punch bag! I could get one from Bristol!

      heloo everybody tommorrow is friday (thank god) and we have the day off! and for all those people out there who don't, don't cry your turn will come. don't you just hate people who walk round like they own the place (not mentioning any names cos anyone who knows me wil know who i'm talking about or will be able to ask me and also if you don't  you won't know them anyway) i personally do. and  have been working on ways to keep myself from screamin at them every time i see them bein the bitches that they are. i sure everybody knows at least one person like this so here are some tips to stop you from whackin them round the head every time you see them. 1. beat the crap out of your punch bag regularly (believe me it works)  2. if you don't have a punchbag then any cuddly toy will work as long as you say sorry afterwards 3.shout everything you want to shout at them at thin air pretending they are there (although don't get too carried away else you'll end up kickin the wall *cough*) yeh well i have more but i fear i may be boring you. so i'll shut up now. anyway what ever you are all doing have fun and be happy

I mean seriously, this is how it goes: Bomb; Isreali's get mad and take occupy land then back to the beginning. They need to stop and talk about this and stop blaming each other. Deaths get us no where, they just teach us how to mourn.

      Noooo! Our post at school didn't work! Infact it threw us off... Hmm, sinister! Hehe, but I had my tarot cards read (whatever, shoot me, at least I didn't put carrot cards!) and apparantly one of my friends has magical powers and I don't believe in love but I have some strong views on how the world was created... Which is a load of rubbish really! For the record: Izzy is the only one with magical powers, the power to smell the same bad smell every day for one! I do believe in love! I'm not actually that sure about how the world was created... I just some times sound like I do! Mmm, but does any one believe in that 'the stars tell your future?' I don't. I like to think that in some way we are in control of out life, and just cause some puny planet is by our system doesn't mean that some thing bad's gonna happen! It's stupid to me! Seriously! I does any one really care and seriously do things cause of the stars? Weird!!! Geez, that's why some people become anorexic, because they feel that that's the only thing they can control in their lives. I guess I don't want to feel like that!

Any way, I do give off a bit too much heat any way I guess! It's reached that one hair wash a day time *sigh* ahh, I hate those! Erm, yeah, I'm not crazy I swear! Hmm, I don't feel too well. :( :( :( But I've been on a spending spree at  urlLink amazon  so that helped. Seriously though, mesa (table?!?!) not feel tooo good. Hey I better go play a game to make me feel better! Eugh, french homework, not good! Today has been fun I guess, totally boring. I recon they're actually trying to kill us in Geography, less people in lessons! Hehe, but we got to see a very scary picture of our tutor with a wig on!

      So hey! I survived both weddings! Actually it was looooads of fun! Both of them had bars, so every one was happy! The first one I went to had a load of fruit, cheese and bread! So we were pigging out of strawberries! The place it was at was soooo lush! They hired out the whole downstairs so we could go every where! Then the people brought out real food and I started pigging out on lush sausages! Rick kept eating bread, lots of it! Oooh, it was really nice and I loved Sarah's dress, she made it herself and it had all these fiddily beads every where. That was really nice, and we actually met David! (Sarah's now husband) cause we hadn't met him before. Sarah and David met at a bus stop! And then Sarah placed this add in a 'I saw you' thingy in the paper. Aww, isn't that just perfect? The second wedding we went to was Dan and Karen's and they've know each other for 10 years! Since they were 12!!! Wow! Hehe, my brother gave Dan the middle of the tardis thingy! (The console!) Hehe, I don't think Karen will be too happy. She had a lush dress too, it was massive! Eugh, I've gotta do washing up now... :( :( :(

      There is no such thing as a bad hug, only good ones and great ones.   They are nonfattening and they don't cause cancer or cavities.  They are all natural, with no preservatives or artificial ingredients.  They are nontaxable and a renewable resource.  They are 100% wholesome and no batteries or tune-up needed.  They are safe in all kinds of weather. In fact, they are very good in cold or rainy weather.  They are effective in treating problems, like bad dreams and Monday blahs.  When you give a hug, you always get one right back.  Never wait till tomorrow to give a hug,  send one right now!!

Oh well *sigh* my mum just came back from a actual wedding, I'm going to the do's later. She wore this hat, and she wrapped a green scarf around it just so she could take her green furry hand bag! Which kind of looks like a green cat if you squint! Mmm, so any way, sorry I'm shopping on amazon again. I'm kind of addicted to it! Oh, you mean a link to downloading ricochet or whatever? Stupid girl, go get it off kazaa.

Anyway, had loads of fun cringing as Katie freaked out everyone on my msn list... and as we made a cool chatroom called "If you don't know where to go...go here!" its on msn.co.uk, look for it! I think it's under "teen". It rules. No one went on it - yeah!!! Wow, the best thing to do is abstract art on paint. Just doing anything!! It's so much fun! You just do a load of random stuff, select areas, copy and paste them and invert the colours and add text and - ahhh! I've just found my favourite thing to do on the computer. It's even better to do it to music. Wow.

      Sliggghtly pissed off at myself! Don't ask why, you don't want to know! Any way, Valvados (or whatever) type stuff cause I think every one thinks you're dead! Any way, every one download this game: Ricochet because it's very cool! You can get beheaded and stuff! Which is soooo cool! Yeay! Hehe, so basically it's a me type of game! :) :) :) I'm very happy cause I get to see my cousins in a bit! Yeeeay! Oh, and every one watch the footie tomorrow! Hey, I have to go to four weddings so I should be reaaaaly tired by the end of the day! What is it about tomorrow? I've been invited to two weddings, a barbecue, to do something with people and to watch footie! Aaargh! Eeek, any way about junk mail. I think they should be banned from sending it to us unless we give them our consent because they're basically harassing us! So their! Take that! Yeah... that showed them...

      So I'm happy happy thismorning.  It hurts when I walk becasue I got stuck in a bog pit and wacked my hip on a rock.  And apparently its meant to be fun, but if thats some peoples idea of fun, then they can carry on and do it.  (Strange people)  I absolutly stand of Odur de Mour end Spout aswell, which is not very pleasant, and I was very hungry and thirsty.  But is was *cough* *cough* Yeah great fun???*cough* *cough*

      Ok, don't panic but some one got on this through searching for... 'cheese dictionary' heeey they taking a trip to the moon or some thing? But seriously, cheese dictionary? (I bet that isn't spelt right, please don't kill me!) Can you speak cheesish, is it a real language or does some one want to know all the cheeses in the world? Has some one really been sad enough to find out all the cheeses! Aaah too many questions swimming round the gunk in my head! Sorry... just trying to spread some random thoughts!

      Ok! Editing spree over! Oh and I was getting kind of Izzy cause it's that time! Eeek, I hope you understand code! Or... maybe I don't. But any way, I'm less pissed now but my fuse is still short! Hehe, angry Katie = not good! Any way, I'm getting a bit angry with every one in our class judging us! I mean if we say some thing then they go and do their 'talking about it' thing. Why are girls so bitchy? So that's why I'm happy with my ear turned off! Boys fight stuff out, and come of with it but girls go all cagey and bitch behind peoples back. Wow, isn't that nice? Mmm... ok, so maybe I am still a tiny bit angry. Oooh get well soon Laura! Cause she was kind of half dead today, she was going through this crazy "I feel sick" then "I feel hungry" thing today! WEIRD! Any way, funny thing for today! This boy in our class found some panty liners in his bag! Don't ask why but he did! And every one was laughing at him, and then a boy stuck one on the wall and some one was trying to walk out with one but Mr Kelly took it off him! Teehee! Then Mr K dropped it in front of a female teacher and every one started laughing! Oh madness days!

      So we aer all happy happy then.  I totally agree with you about *Flob* (NOTE: Edited for... erm, reasons....) She was doing my head in.  If she hadn't sat there Izzy and I could have had such a good argument.  Grrrrrrr.  So we are into the next round of the world cup.  I've been watching that guns and roses thing again.  It was the last one, because it was only a two part series.  Oh well I'll just have to go back to playing on the internet on wednesday night now then.  Right I'm going to go and play now.  O and I agree with all that you said about *Flob*  I hope that shes not clever enough to work out how to use our profiles.

      So heheeeeey hahaaaa! Sorry about me being all moody in maths, it's just that I was getting really pissed off with *Flob*! I mean GOOOOD! First she invites herself to sit with us, and then Izzy says about going to sit with Emma cause she was all alone and *Flob* was like "Oh well, ok I don't really like her" so she took Izzy's seat! Then she goes and starts bugging me about pratically letting her copy my homework which I spent hours on, and I said no so she started saying "I'll pay you money." I'm sorry but I'm not some kind of whore you know. Well ok, I know she wasn't asking for that, but their's no way I'll do any thing for money and it just pisses me off when some one tries it on me. (Can I breathe now?) NO! Any way, sorry, ok breathe moral rant over! (*Inhales deeply*) Ahh, better. Any hoo I think I need Saturday!!! I NEED SATURDAY! Hey can some one contact the calender guy and ask him to change tomorrow from a Thursday to a Saturday, because I want Saturday and we have a load of homework for Thursday!!! Oooh, and England drew 0 - 0 which means that we're going through! But we've only scored 2 goals so far and the next thing's a knock-out thing so we might not get very far. Score more goals! Go England!

      Yeaaah! Hey what's the prize? MONEY?!!! Hehe, I'm not that obsessed with having money ya know, some people are though! Oh dear, now I'm doubting my spelling of prize... Eeeek, I need help! I think Fathers day is on Saturday by the way! Ooooh... we should ask every one... or should we? Hmm, some one think about it! Any way I don't think I'll get a light sabre, cause yeah fun, but trash. I would never use it and it would be stored away, forever preserved as a waste of plastic. I'm gonna get some manga instead! :) :) :) Just oh-so slightly obsessed with that at the moment! Soooo what's every one else obsessed with? Am I losing my touch with obsession cause I don't know?! Well I recon that what you were saying about Rosie is erm interesting. Lynne said that Rosie is jelous of our 'kiddyness' ooh, fun! She's in a pretty bad way though if she's had an over dose and basically - been completely screwed. Any hoo, me and Izzy were thinking about some thing! :O :O :O I know! It's so rare it's gotta be interesting! (Geez, if that isn't the lamest sales gimic in the world!) Yeah, I know.  On a dark stormy day.... (!) Hey! Any way, their's this guy, Bob. He's convinsed that he's in a coma, every thing revolves around him and what he wishes for happens. He's convinsed that he's all powerful and every one will do what he wants. Bob gets bored with this, he wants to go back to the real world! He wants to find out all the real things... see real things... (God! Crap Queen! Just dragging it on a litttttttle bit, aren't you?) Okay, okay, so cutting the sentimental crap: One day he decides to take his life, he's bored with (Grrr...) erm, chocolate... so he jumps off a cliff. Unlukly (shoot me) for him, he was in the real world, but he miraculously hits his head instead of dying and goes into a coma. He then believes that the coma world is totally real because the real world was the coma world for him! Interesting thought, aye? (No... not really) Ok... I know when I'm not wanted! '( (Heeeeheee angry dude!) Any way... *sob sob* Bubi!

I would be happier if it was boiling hot and not threatening rain though! Hmm... but were in England though and that's close to impossible! Do you remember doing sun dances in year 2? Hmm... scary! Eeeek! But seriously, we did a load of scary things when we were kids. *gags laura and izzy* Ahhh... better... Hey has any one got a sledge hammer? I need to hit my ear cause it's gone again and i can't hear any thing! Apart from the bubbling gunk... which is kind of unnerving cause it never goes quiet. Hmm... some one blog!

Well I am like size 8 or some thing admazingly ridiculous, but it's really annoying! My fingers and toes are too long! Eugh, enough of moaning, I'll save it for my mum so she'll get me new shoes! Any way, did any one watch Ireland v Germany today? I did! It ended up as 1 all but Ireland were playing waaay better and deserved to win! Yeah! Go Ireland! So any way, seeing as we're totally rubbish at football and we're gonna win (England) who should we back now? The little green men? Yeah, maybe some other random place though! Yeay! Hehe, who would think that every one cares about a little game so much? Ok, so that's why no one's blogged. Nothing to blog about! Hmm... oh yeay! My birthday on the 9th! I think I've said that about one million times already though! I'm gonna go... do Mr Fopple! Yeah! Even though I'm totally stuck! Oh well, bubi!

      Yeay! Well it is tomorrow... and every one's gone! I watched that Jubilee thingy too, I watched both concerts and they seemed to be obsessed with singing "Love" by the Beatles. Apart from they didn't, they just sang "Love, love, love" about fifteen million times and if I her it one more time then I think I might shoot myself! (Don't get any ideas people!) Did you know that the rock concert was broadcast to thirty countries and twenty million people watched it! It was soooo good! (Well, the old fogies were!) Oh, and whooooopie! S Club 7 are apparantly splitting up! (So there is a god after all!...) Haha, as you can see I'm very upset about that. ;) ;) ;) And every one should check this out  urlLink http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=eccentricity%20  Hmm... now does that word remind you of any thing or any one? Hey! Stop looking at me!!! Another weird thing that we became obsessed with in Spanish is this website:  urlLink http://www.hotelparquesur.com/  Of course we didn't learn any thing, but hey it's fun and oooooh! IT HAS A VIRTUAL TOUR! Yeay! Oh but it's got this freaky sign thingy if you look all the way down! Have fun looking around the rooms guys! (Maybe I shouldn't of said that...)

We have to go shopping in Bristol ok?! Hey I'm gonna go shop on Amazon cause I've got £15 to spend from people... so they don't have to give me money! Aha! Manga here I come!

      Hehehe, I sent Hassall a birthday card with a pink bunny rabbit with balloons and a rainbow in the backround! Just his sort of thing, isn't it? Ohhh the plastacine thing was sooo much fun! It looked really dumb! My mum loved it and wanted to watch it again and again (strange). Well it looks like it might end up just being me, you and Claire tomorrow - oh well!

      So today was fun! We did model animation as a summer course at Backwell School. Izzy was the oldest there! (Mentally and physically!) Hehe, not really.... well I'm not sure about the mental side! It was sooo much fun, but the guy running it was so sexist! The pig! He kept going on about how all the boys would want to destroy things and the girls like to do flowers. So on ours, we destroyed every thing. ;) Well we had to show him didn't we? Hehe! It was me, Izzy, this girl, a guy called Ben and another guy called Joe. I yapped to Ben and Joe loads (well what else would I do?) We talked about erm... locking some one in a locker and stuff. (Highly technical) They were fun! They go to Backwell though. Oh, we got a video of what we did! It's funny! A whole day for two and a half minutes of moving plasticine! Aaargh! Oh well, it was work it!

      I got an e-mail called 'RE: I will cheat on mmy husband with you'! Does the words 'bugger off' mean any thing to these people? I also got an e-mail from Neopets, apparantly I lost my password and was trying to find it out - in English some one tried to hack me. What a dumb ass, that's a dumb way to hack, hell that's not even hacking! Learn how to hack guys! Yeay I'm playing games! (Well that's a change.) Heeey! It's fun! Hehe, I'll talk about today later, this is kind of pointless and it might ruin that!

And now I'm sumo wrestling with sandwiches! Yeay!  urlLink http://www.nabiscoworld.com/  Fuuuun! Trust me, it is! Hehe, oooh yeah like you haven't got a thing! Every  one's got a thing! ...I think... *clueluess* (What's a thing...?) I'm not quite sure, Izzy seemed to know! Hehe... wow I won sumo wrestling! (I'm so good!) Hmm... who thinks we should practise our tribal dancing to intimidate people dance? Who thinks I need to learn how to spell? (Thousands of hands shoot up) *sweatdrop* Erm... ok... DANCING LESSONS YEAY! Hehe... tomorrow's gonna be fun! Oooh, meet up on Thursday guys? See the Crocodile film! (I feel sorry for you, I'm not gonna shut up about it even after I've seen it!) Wow!

Thats why you hear about it all the time! (Stupid girl)  Sooooo - today was fun, me and Emma bought incredibly cool hats and got lots of stares. Tomorrow could be scary in a fun kinda way! I'm buying a blank tape from "Oscar" ! Ok....

      Ok... back into oh my god that's sad mode! Ok so I was reading this story and oh my god that was sad! If you haven't cried and needed to then when you cry you cry it all. Another deep and meaningful thing, but sad. Hmm... I could go into all this stuff about why I do stuff but that's just down right depressing! When I was younger I thought that it was me versus the world because of... stuff so I guess that's why I was all quiet and must do good in school when I was younger, I guess that's why I can't be bothered some times, to look good for other people but I still care. *breathes* Deep and meaningful enough? Mmm... maybe. Geez, I'm gonna go all spiritual now, aargh this spiritual music that my brother has downloaded just annoys me. Aww, isn't it tight, today was my dad's 'day off' but he went into work any way! They work him too hard! I'm gonna go kill people on FFX even though I died! (sob sob) Must... kill... Seymour! (Or however you spell it) Ok... time to go, seriously, before the cats try and eat me cause I haven't fed them bubi!

      Redundant? YOU'VE BEEN FIRED?!?! Hehe, not really. Oooh, you and you friend aye? (Izzy's got a thing for him!) Hey, I am annoying. I'm that pet chiwawa that you love to hate... Actually, I'ld rather not be a chiwawa, those things yap waay too much and they smell! (That is not me! Don't say any thing!) Mmm... very weird. This police siren kind of kept going half off then stopping. Maybe the SWAT team doesn't want me to know that they're here. :D Who want's to be serious? Their's a time a place for every thing and serious has to be saved for very special occasions! Trust me I should now. (Oooh, deep and meaningful aye?) Hehe, I love doing that. Saying things and getting every one to pick what they want out of it. Every one interperits things in different ways, like if I said: You've never been hurt like I've been hurt... Ok, so that could err be dodgey but I wouldn't say that! (You're in a hole and you're falling deeper fast) Eeek, I always dig myself into holes. Bit hyper cause I'm bored and it's total silence in my house cause it's only me here! Bubi!

      Ok well I feel redundant, cos I went to the shop this morning and the person who's round I was supposed to be covering showed up! Doh! It was funny though cos another newsie-person took my paperbag with keys and money in it by accident, and me and my scary friend had to go out on our bikes and find him so i could get my bag back and go home! And I've spent the rest of today doing nothing....woopeee-doooooo...tra-la-laaaaa pom-pom twiddlie-woddle...

I'm gonna go scrub mold off of bath tyles for money! (Sigh, reduced to that!) Oh well, I don't care, so long as I'm helping. Today every one's leaving me alone with my grandpa and great aunt. We're probably gonna spend the whole day either watching cricket or going to the pub! Fun! Well I'm reading some thing so bubi!

      Oh god! I've spent like, all week with HER! Sympathy, PLEASE! I'm pooed off cos this week have do do a weekday round in the mornings! Arghhh! I am getting seriously pissed off with this job! No one else will do the extra rounds, so the guy at the shop always expects me to do them, and I always end up having to. Smell. I've been doing it for a ear and a half now, so you can see why I'm just a little fed up. I'm gonna see if I can find something different. But it is kinda fun though, me and my newsie-friends were playing with the musical greetings cards in the shop today, there was one that played "macerina" amd we were all (three of us!!) standing in the middle of the shop doing the macerina, until Simon (ownie-type-guy) came along and told us off. :(

      Mmm... BBQ! Yeay! Slight obsession with them at my house at the moment. I looove the smell of bonfires! Don't you? (Geez, talk about random!) Hey, that wasn't... much... You know, BBQ = fire, bonfire = fire, fire = fire so BBQ = bonfire! Ok, ok, so it worked in my head! (Every thing works in my head) Really it does! Pink bunny rabbits live in harmony along side cool killing machines that make 'pe-ch-ow' sounds! (Uhuh...) Ok, I really shouldn't share what's inside my head should I? BBQ time! Bubi!

Yeah cool! And... guess what? I'm spider man! I got my face painted and now I look... well stupid as normal but I'm spider man people! S-P-I-D-E-R M-A-N! (I'm sure they know how to pronounce it) Well I don't know how to spell so HA! (That doesn't work!) Owchie, I need to itch but I can't! One good thing about having a red face is that is covers for you if you go read! I'm ready to take on the world now! And oooh I won bowling! :P We also went on scary shooting games! God, the Juarassic Park one is soooo scary! Izzy left me all alone on it! :'( We also went on the stupid rowing one that we were rubbish on! We got nowhere! Owchie... has any one written on a book about how to scratch you face if it's covered in face paint that you don't want to smudge? Thought not... worth a try though! (Not really...) So how is every one? Well... I've seen Izzy every day for like ages... AAARGH! Get me out of here! So hey, every one tell me when you're coming back from holiday or going ok? Did any one else get this weird video thing from Berti...? Just thought I'd ask bubi!

We don't know when you're coming back (if you're even going) so we don't know when to give you your pressie! Would you like it on your birthday (if you're going to be here) without Katie, or another day with both of us? Arghh! Well I'm off on the 3rd of Augie and coming back the day before your birthday, and I think Katies going on the 5th (???) and coming back god knows when... How stupid - why don't I just text you!? You're probably not going to read this until you get back! *smacks forehead* Arghhhh...  I am almost totally booked up for this week - Sunday:Bowling, Monday:Does anyone wanna come ice-skating? Tuesday:Emma Bisacre's, Wednesday:Animation course, Thursday:Cinema?, Friday:??? (packing?) Saturday: Eastboure! (woo-diddlie-hoo)

You've got some damn freaky presents! Ha! Sucker! (Geez if I get freaky stuff for Laura then what will she get me...?) Scary! :'( I'm wearing shorts! I looked like such a idiot walking through Nailsea with shorts on, but my mum told me it would be warm! Last time I trust my mum's weather advice! I'm gonna go soak in some lard now bubi.

      Hey again I'm just taking up the flooble, what can I say? I tried to diet but it didn't work out. :P Madddd! Hehe, my computer's sooo slow at the moment. I'm actually typing this but it's coming out in white... freaky, it's cause I type too fast. Plus the fact that my computer's probably had some weirdness rubbed off on it over the years. Yow it bit me! (See what I mean?) Oh, it's slow cause I'm copying a Goldfinger cd, hmm... maybe I should not do any thing while it's doing it so I don't anger the computer... Nah! Eeek, I'm going. It's kind of freezing then unfreezing at the moment! Bubi!

      So hey. Ahh... I need to scream. Doesn't every one? Sorry about the short blog but I was all hyper and I needed to do things, but now I'm all mellow so this is gonna be one long blog. That is if I get some moral thing to rant about... Hmm... Have you tried Harry Krishna? Hehe, sorry, stuck in muppet world for a moment then! What's every one been doing? Can we go to the cinema to see that Crocodile film on Tuesday or Wednesday? Whatever suits every one but I prefer it to be Wednesday cause my mum's off on Tuesday. Aargh, my brother gets his GCSE results back some time! Eeek, scary! It's either gonna be celebration time or his social life going down the pan. Aww, poor flatrik. Hey that was Izzy that thought of that name! Was it? Or was it some other weird person... (Not that I'm surrounded by weird people or any thing.) I recon the last people in Big Brother should boycott it and both of them walk out just before they read out the winner or some thing. Hehe, that would be funny! But Laura would probably start crying... and no one would do that because of all the money you win. *sigh* It's all about the money nower days isn't it? Money to greed. The base of evil. Hey, I'm sorry I guess I read too many books and watch too many cartoons! Or... I'm just weird... Yeah, I'm weird. And now... On to taking over the world with this banana! (...I don't see a banana...) Visualise man! Ok, I'm going! Bye bye!

My Dad's going on a boat trip tomorrow! (Random yup!) With my Uncle and other random people! My Uncle owns a boat... but my Dad's only been on one of these boating things once before! I think I've been on it before... all I remember was the horror at having to wear these bright red massive life jackets! Eww, FASHION HORROR! Not that I know any thing about fashion... I'm wearing a string top with trousers! Ah, yes, a bright pink top. (AHH! The mental image! I'm scarred for life!) Hey, you're on me you know! That sounds dodgey... gotta go cause my Dad's doing a BBQ bubi!

I was like mentally going 'you dare do any thing to me and i swear i will rip your head off and shove it into you cold lifeless body' ...hehe... I think they got it telepathicly. When I walk I look really stressy and walk quickly on purpose - so people will leave me alone... doesn't always work. (Damn) Maybe I should look really happy and skip, then people would definatly leave me alone! Ok, so I guess I am a bit antisocial kind of leave me alone like. Hey, it's not as if people try! I overly do some times and it just ends up in a awkward mess. *shivers* Eugh, note to self: don't freak people out. That's my point in life though! (Freaked huh? Me too!) I love ska. :D It's all happy and jumpy! And makes me go hyper! Trashy pop stuff, bleurgh who needs it? It just goes all trashy and depressing! Nu-uh! Go ska! Okay... bit hyper and mad but hey you don't have to live with me! (I'm going....) Ok, bubi!

No one else turned up and we tried phoning every one, then we went to Jon's house... well, what we thought was his house and we pratted about. Then we asked his sister and she said he was ill! So we spent like an hour waiting for him and he didn't come! We got Laura's present (be very afraid) and Mike got a load of clothes. I got a hemp purse! Yeay! Also I got some gloves... don't ask... so now I'm broke! I went to take out money but I kind of mucked it up! Whoops! It came up with this thing saying 'go to your nearest branch'. Whoopsies. Mmm... we should do some thing on Saturday cause I think Kim moved her thing to Sunday... weird! I get no peace!

      Yeah Dude, where's my car? rocks! that is the best movie! American Pie was just err... ever so slightly none-pointish. I mean, wow, it's a film about people losing their virginity praise be to the film. (Yeah - right) Mmm... I don't think the WSL's would get Dude, where's my car? it's our type of humor (teach me how to spell god please do!) and as I've said a million gazillion times, some people (most people) don't get it at all. Go Izzy, you write a sad story go you! I'm wrighting one about this guy who's obsessed with ants... and killing them... He lives in this really old cottage and this lady comes to see him and err wrighters block their! Oh yeah, he's entering this children's book competition thingy. So basically it's a load of crap, but a different type of crap to Izzy's. I seriously don't know where it's going though! Help me! Mmm... but that happens with all my stories. Go Izzy, you actually use paragraphs! :O Shock horror! Hehe, lemme try! Holidays: A time for sitting round and doing nothing, me arranging get togethers, ice-lollies, spending time with your family (which can some times drive you crazy) and a time for taking over the world. But then again, every season is a time for taking over the world! Well, for me it is! Hey, should I be the threee headed monkey? (Damn, forgot how to spell be. Aaargh, that's right you dim-wit! Oops!) Hmm... I'll go arrange assasinations with Mango.

I've decided to write a story/book or something (just nod) about this eccentric wannabe writer (say nothing) who decides she's going to publish a diary of her living in all these different places, like a muddy hole six feet underground, on a house roof, on a shack in the middle of the sea etc, and its gonna be called - "Life in a Hole and other stories" Sad huh? With quotes like - "I can now fully empathise with an earthworm" and "I managed to forget my diary, so I have spent the last few days constructing writing materials out of mud" and "I think I've spent too much time around the birds on this tweet-tweet roof and I tweet-tweee-twee a nice little tweet so I just had to tweet-tweeee!" I know its crap, but its my crap goddammit!  Anyway, American Pie was soooo rubbish! I laughed once or twice, but not exactly out loud. It was just a load of sad popularity-crazed guys trying to get laid to impress eachother, and treating these girls like shit! And Rosie and Lisa were like - "Oh it's soooo funny! "Dude, where's my car is soooo crap!" " Excuse me, but phsyco-ostriches, dumb teenagers, a stoner dog, a derranged chinese food restuarant assistant, swedish/welsh aliens and a load of really really funny gags equals one hell of a shibby-sweet movie, dude!

      Mmm, Rosie was being a prick today - again. What's the deal with her? Even if we had a big sign with 'fuck off' on it in big illuminous letters I still don't think she'ld get it! Eugh, I'm so glad we have the holidays no more putting up with the WSLs! Yeay! We actually have freedom! Weirdness to the world! Hehe... but we don't have to be judged and put down for every thing we do now! If I see her during the holidays I think I seriously might have to restrain myself so I don't punch her... we've gone over it. Yeah, slightly obsessed - but passionatly (spelling! aargh I'm trying, sorry!) so! And darn proud of it! Hmm... I'm in a freaky mood... COOL! Ok, so 10:30, Thursday, Superdrug got it every one? Good! I'm gonna go freak the world! ...Wait a minute... done that already damn! (Well I beat Izzy to it!) Bisi!

      Oook then! Hehe, read this: (Sorry, I took it off, it was one of those 'hey I'm gonna strech your page and make it look dumb' (DUMBER THAN IT ALready is? I didn't think that was possible!) So err... just pretend that it's there!) Geez... long link... but it's a permalink, whatever that means! *clueless* So today was fun and no more school! We did a whole lot of nothing basically, then we looked at our SATs papers eeek! Nooo! That was horrible! We also found out what sets we're in next year... well some of them! I'm not moving down yeay! Or is that so good...? Hehe, we watched American Pie Uncut in Maths and our teacher turned it off because it started getting too dodgey! We watched a freaky French film that no one got in French cause it was mega mega hard french! Like the actual french that they talk in France! :O I mean oh my god, we don't know that! Any way - back to being happy that we have no more school! YEAY! We're gonna be in year 10 next year, ahh scary! I mean aaargh GCSE year! Yipes! Aaargh, holidays means me ringing around and arranging things! Help! Oh well... and hey, does any one actually know Mike's phone number? (New kid) I don't! Oh well!

But then again, if you don't that means more sweets for me, tee hee! Ok, so Rosie is being smelly... I could go on a moral rant but it would probably be too similar to yours, Katie, so I won't for the benefit of all those (yeah, right) sad people reading this who don't want to read our badly-written ramblings more than once. Yeah so the new person - just a little scary! Mr.K introduced me as - "A lovely girl, but very common," The ckeek!

Eeek, I'm being out blogged by Laura! (Lol, god I'm sad!) But any way, we need to find out when every one's going on holiday and stuff and arrange... things! Today was very fun wasn't it? Oooh! Last day tomorrow! Yeay! We'll be in year 10 next year... hmm, that's kind of scary! And my brother will be in year 12! That's even scarier! Oh nooo! He'll be one of the scary six formers that walk around! :O Hehe... but you lot are just Rik's-sisters-friends! Ha! Step down from being Rik's-sister don't you think? *forces you to nod* Ahh... better... Hehe, why is it that girls always slapmin movies and stuff? Come on girls thwak it to em! We seriously should start up punching instead of slapping, much more effective don't you think? Ok, so no I haven't taken my medication! Hello, I am wearing a Kermit the Frog T-shirt and listening to weird music! I'm meeeeeeee! I'm maaaaaaad! Hmm... slightly hyper, sozzers guess I better go bubi!

      Heeey yeah, today was fun. We've got this new person in our class, Michael (can't spell eep!) and he's ok. He'll be a bit more chatty when he gets settled down I think. Hehe, it's fun watching everyone in our class ignore it, isn't it? Mmm... but it's their fault, we're being all open and 'we don't care who you are, come talk to us!' ...must... stop dwelling on this! I might go all depressed again if I'm not careful... Oh, I've totally given up hope on Rosie. I guess I had this view that every one was really nice but it's been totally scrubbed by her. Yeah, I know niave (speleeeleleleiiing!) or what but still it was a nice notion I guess. She's just so horrible, and for her own personal gain. If she ever had any nice bones in her body I think they would of exploded by the time she was three. What's up with her? I bet she has one of these 'divorced parents, dead relatives story', but then, doesn't everyone? Ok, sorry, I'm listening to Bob Marley and I'm going all psylophical (owch, bite me) and err... rastafarian like! Fun! Mmm... I was trying to help her out and she just said "shut up" really seriously and it hit me. I was being kind, not provoking her or doing any thing to her apart from offering her kindness and then she's just mean and throws it back in my face, what's her problem? Is it so hard to even think about being nice to people? Can she think of no other's apart from herself? I never want to know her when I'm older and I doubt that any one else will. Ok, I'll snap out of it in a bit and blog later! Bubi!

      Yeay! You get £1,000 out of this best british web blog thingy if you win... Errr... yeah like we'll win! Hehe, oh sorry about lack of blogging but I've actually been doing things! :O No, no, don't worry, I don't have a life. (Phew, getting worried their!) Heey! Oh well. We went to Laura's house today. We = me, Lynne and Izzy. We went and played rounders in the park and with my great hitting skills I won, of course. :P (Yeah right!) Then Laura's next door neighbours we're being... freaky... They said "You're gay" So Lynne and Izzy were like hugging each other and going "Yeah we are." I got a tiny winy bit scared! Then one of them said "Gregory (or whoever the sad little kid was) fancies you." So I said "Sorry, we're gay." Ok, so it was funny at the time! What else... oh yeah, obsessive swinging and then I found out the swing gave me black marks on my legs! Eeek! And we freaked this young kid out, nah, we didn't. We were overly "Oh, hi, so what's you name?" Ya know? Yeah... sure... We watched Never Been Kissed for like the millionth time and Lynne cried! We also did some Pop dancing with Lizzie Web. *cringe* That was bad! Every one was going on about how they've had deep and meaningful discussions about the WSL's with their parents - so have I! Mmm... scary. Hehe, I might go on freaky mode tomorrow and totally freak every one out! We've got two days of school left! Noooooooooo! :'( All we'll do is watch videos, so it's ok I guess. Still a bit of a bummer. I'll bring Galaxy Quest (yeay!), The Road to El Dorado (YEAY!) and the Twelve Monkeys to make me look serious (Next to impossible!) Every one bring things! Yeay! Play pinyata? Ok, so I'm going weird, sorry that popped into my head! Mmm... barbeque... follow the smell... I'll be going now bubi!

      Yeah, so having fun? Oh dear, Katie's taking them on rubberfaces.com...interesting choice. How come it's all down to you to entertain these people anyway? Well I think Of Mice and Men has mentally impaired me, because for some reason I can't stop thinking about it and I was reading it this morning (we have a copy at home) and I started crying! I'm so sad. Anyway... Yes! Enter our blog! Not that we'll get a mention, but do it all the same! Now that REALLY would be funny!   Getting annoyed with all thesse "Answer the questions and send it on to everyone you know!" thingies, so I'm thinking about making my own, but with loadso of really dumb questions like - "Which is better - The Moon, or Uranus?" or "What's your favourite mode of transport - Space-hopper or Magic Carpet?" . Cause all the ones that go round have pretty much the same questions like - "Who's your favourtie movie star?" and "What's your favourtie food?" I mean, come on - be a little inventive, guys!

Hmm... watch the Road to El Dorado! YES! Wow, I have every thing worked out now... they're gonna go home never wanting to come back again! Woohoo! Nah, that's tight! I don't really deal with shy people very well... do I? Or do I? I just kind of blabber on and ask them meaningless questions every now and then. Are jam dougnuts more of a dougnut than cream ones? (Sorry about spelling!) So basically I'm like what I'm like on here.... but not. Wow, full circle! Madness! Dude, where's my car? I'll go find out what I can do to freak these people out!

Any way, I keep getting these e-mails about serial killers in America and 'FBI warnings' uhuh... I'm freaked! Hey who votes we should enter this Guardian best web blog thing? (For the money of course!) Mmm... but it'll be like people judging your life and my life gets as interesting as a pea stuck in custard... although that could be pretty interesting! Aaargh I put this lavander perfume on and now all I can smell is that! I'm gonna be haunted by lavender for the rest of my days! FUN! Hmm... glad you're feeling better, and hey we don't mind if you throw up on us, might improve Izzy's smell and err it could be interesting mixed with lavander! I'm gonna post this now and do another one after it... yep, it's pointless information kids.

Probably the gross cakes (not to self - never trust Laura's cooking again). You poor fruitcake (my fave new expression) having to walk to Grove to get a key, how smelly. Hehehe, guess it could have been kinda fun at the time.  Well woo-diddlie-hoo, 'fraid I might not be able to come out tomorrow Kes, I'll leave you to have fun juggling standing on your head, or whatever extreme measures you'll end up going to when trying to entertain the "scary shy people" coming round! have fun, and don't tell them about Zigganought, Vera the stuffed cabbage or Mr.Fopple unless they seem like that kind of person, ok? Just show them Virtual Fighter 4 or something and watch them run.   So are we doing something on sunday? I've decided to ask my short-longie guy-friend person why he's not talking to me because you'd be pissed off if I decided that I was only going to know you on certain days of the week, wouldn't you?!

So anyway, oh yeh and it was a good thing that you guys told me to go home cos i threw up again this afternoon. so thankyou. ahhhhhh it was soooo annoyin, by the time i got home i felt rather shitty and then realised i did'nt have a key. sooo i trailed my way to grove to get my mums key and then trailed home again. by which time i was close to the point of collapsing. but it was sooooo funny cos this person who was in there front garden must have got seriously freaked out cos i walked past there three times and they were still there! believe me it was funny at the time. anyway why were you scared? did anythin happen today at school? did you get any homework?  so....yeh you guys can still come round on sunday but i probably should'nt do anythin tomorrow just in case i feel worse and you guys will all end up covered in spew. lovely huh?. why this an incredibly long blog...well for me anyway. hee hee. so wheres lynne these days? she has'nt blogged for like, sixty million years. and you say i dont blog enough.  see ya dudes

Guess we'll just have to book another vets appointment for him then! :D Oh, funniest thing in the world: (Sorry I'm wondering around, you usually have to kick me before I actually wake up and do some thing) *WHACK!* Owch, not that hard! :'(  urlLink http://clevermedia.com/arcade/pirateriddles1.html  Mmm... I've probably mentioned it before but oh well! Hey Laura go on it if you're feeling sicky and bad oh and I'm sorry that we forced you to go home, I have to tell you. It's you're smell! Joking, joking, it's cause we're worried about you and if you do have a bug you should rest! Ok... I'm scared... I'm gonna go hide and eat bananas and apples bubi!

      Hey! Aww, Laura threw up today so we made her go home! Are you feeling better now Laura? I hope so! Today was - ye insignificant dot day - or at least that's what it felt like! Beki didn't come to school so at the end it was just me and Izzy in our class... and boy did we feel insignificant! Every one was ignoring us in Spanish and it was fun! Then I had these head phones on and this really loud music came on and I screamed. Aparantly every one noticed but I wasn't too sure... Oh and I had to wear black flower trouses today *sigh/cringe* Hehe, but I'm so head strong that no body said any thing! YOU PUNY MORTALS! Any way... *cough* slightly ignoring that! Heeey but I go scary when I'm around my friends so every one's ignoring me already! Fun! At least we won't have to deal with the WSL's any more... I hope! Oh and Izzy said that her mum told her to punch Rosie! Woah! Go Izzy's mum's influence on Izzy! (If that makes any sense!) Oh and I'm oh-so slightly addicted to Final Fantasy X so I'm not blogging as much as I used to! Sorry! I'll breathe on this now, blog later bubi.

      Hi people, ok so I have scary friends but what can I say? I am scary! Ok so I keep hearing some one knocking on the door, maybe I do need hearing aids! Yeay! Any way today was fun! Apart from the WSL's kept talking about me in French and major freak out so we ended up writing a load on the table about it and then Izzy had to rub it out before the teacher saw! Hehe funny! Oh and I was freaked by some thing else but oh well... In art Laura attacked me with chalk! so i fought back and now we're both covered in it, eek don't kill me mum! (My t-shirt used to be white!) Jon got stressy cause I wouldn't tell him what this was, oh and he attacked me and it hurt so I kind of whaked him. Geez, he's soooo week! Wow, I still can't spell! Some one buy me a book called 'How to spell'! Back to WSL thing, well they were like KATIE and then one of them was saying "Oh my god, I wouldn't do that Rosie" so I think she's got a evil plan for me! YEAY! Haha, lets watch Katie take her anger out on Rosie, that could be fun! Never mess with some one who is happy almost all of the time because they probably have a load of anger stored up and they're probably meaner than the mean people! Ok, well it doesn't make sense... but it does in way.

      Hello! I'm in geography and its pretty boring! At least we're not learning anything! Me and kes are going on an animation course this summer! We're gonna be with a load of 12 year olds, but never mind! Well I've given up reading all kes's blogs because it takes me so long that by the time I've finished reeding them, I have to go! (Smelly kes) Anyway! Yeah, loadsa scary things happening lately, monday was really scary cos loadsa people were out to kill us! Or so it seemed! Anyway...  Yeah well the Zoo Trip was fun, we answered all the questions on the sheet in the first 2 hours, and spent the rest of the time messing around and hitting Jon with our clipboards. 'Twas fun. We also tried to lock kes in the gorilla's cage but she was too big. (Hehehehe) We need to have another gathering soon, in Bristol maybe? The last one was fun, and maybe Vinnie will turn up this time! (Or maybe not) Yeah we should go to Bristol and get plastic swords! Wait, we've done that already...nevermind! Let's do it again! I seriously need to watch Dude, where's my car? again, because I'm just slightly obsessed with it. Wow this is the first time in ages that I've been able to blab on and on, because people are always talking to me on msn when I'm trying to type, so I usually manage to say something like - "Hi... I'm going now..." . Ooh sorry! I need to do Mr.Fopple Chapter 4 for you kes (*groan*) sorry, but she'll kill me if I don't get onto it (eek). Don't excpect it to be any good!  My Brother's party was a riot, imagine 8 extremely high 6 year olds running wild at megabowl with balloon-swords?! It was like - "What part of "Don't run off!" don't you understand!" sigh. He got loads of really cool pressies though. I'm quite jealous. Well apparently Katie is being mean to Laura and Jon hit katie on the head "And it hurt!" . Andwfirvhy6kmuijphl (that was katie) Arghh! Minor panic! Katie just got rid of all my writing, but we somehow managed to get it back again!  Bet you didn't think I could say this much did you?

      Nooooooo! I lost the last post I did it by doing some weird thing...! Whoops! Any way I went shopping today in Bristol and at the moment I'm wondering where every one is. I went with my mum so I actually got some stuff! :O :O :O I now, shock horror style! Oh if you're wondering why I'm here it's cause the 'support staff' are on strike! Yeay! Go them! They set up a picket line outside of school apparantly! Woohoo! We just get a day off of school. Aaah, I love our school. Oh, and Izzy I am doing that model animation (darn still can't spell) course at Backwell! Yeay! We can do really dumb stuff and freak every one out! Ahh I love being me some times, although other times I really hate it... Mmm... but that's the same with every one, isnt' it cause no one's perfect. Uhuh, so seriously... people...? Any way, scary thing I have to do my piano exam soon eeeeek! I mean aural HELP! (Yeah, yeah, I need a dictionary!) Bet that's spelt wrong any way! Hey I'm gonna go freak people out and then curl up into a ball, bye.

      Oooook slightly less depressed yeay! I was listening to 'Corny Pirate Riddles' it was funny! Ok, so I'm easily amused! See, it doesn't take a lot of effort to get me back on track! Care more people! Love, freedom! (Oh dear she's gone hippy like!) Whoops, sorry! Heheeee any way! Now that I'm happy, I'm happy! Like hypeeeeeeeeeeeer happy! Yeay let's go take over the world! Hehe... heh... maybe not! Aaargh, having a war with this advert that keeps popping up and I keep getting rid of it! Ha! I won! Uhuh... quite scared. Time for bastard music therapy! Go download it if you haven't. (What you haven't? I've talked about it about a million zillion times!!!) Don't let the bastards grind you down - The toasters, you might have to just search for 'toasters' on Kazaa cause that's what I had to do. Now I have it on disc and on the computer! Yeay! Funny, we're only 14 and every one takes every thing really seriously. Aaargh advert wars again! Hehe, I have a Halifax pin number now! But no dudy card! :'(

      Sorry about that, my dream bubble popped today. Well ok, so in English I kind of day dream all the time and when the dream finishes I come back to reality and I realise how much it sucks. Sad aye? Sad but strange, sad but strange. No one wants to talk to me apart from you guys and I don't know if I can be bothered to do all the talking around people! Why should I bother? Ok depressed Katie! And now I'm listening to Metallica... hmm, time to paint my room black! Hey I'm getting weird again! Yeay! Told you it only lasted a few seconds. Ok, back to being slightly depressed. Maybe it's an early life crisis! Yeay! Oh well... hmm I need jump up and go music but I can't find any. When I get knocked down, Will you still be here hanging around? Staring in my eyes, Laughing at my demise. Watching me cry, Wondering why, And if you care, Reach out for me And help me be free. OK! Well I need to go watch tv before I seriously turn every thing black!

I'll blog later... when I'm not so pissed off. (In about 3 seconds probably, I'm moody and yeah it is what you think.) If that makes any sense...

      So heeeeeeeeey! It's hard to die when you're already dead! Yeah, we keep telling Izzy that but she doesn't listen! (Smelly zombie Izzy!) Any way, what was the point to this? Oh yeah! Well, in technology we're doing airline meals and me and Izzy are doing a flight to Sandwich Island! I went on this website and found a few... faults with this! Hehe stupid! Population: no indigenous population; there is a small military garrison on South Georgia, and the British Antarctic Survey has a biological station on Bird Island; the South Sandwich Islands are uninhabited *COUGH COUGH COUGH* (I don't think any one noticed!)  Highways:  total: NA km  paved: NA km  unpaved: NA km  Ports: Grytviken   Airports: none   That could kind of make it hard for the airoplane to land! But shhh don't tell any one and I don't think they will notice!

      Ok so now we're getting lessons in what to watch at the cinemas and on tv from Laura! But she can't talk, she doesn't watch Fox Kids. ;) Is there an actual Fox channel? I think there is! But Laura isn't sure... geez we're so dumb! If there is we don't get it in England! or we don't. Mmm... we just get sucky stuff! Ok so I told Laura every thing and now we're scared! Hehe... great... Any way, nothing happened today cause every one else was at the zoo and we're going tomorrow! Yeay! Anna said (according to Lynne) that they we're 'protecting' Emma by not telling her... I'm not sure though. I just did what I thought was best I guess! Every one does that though I hope!  urlLink http://www.funbrain.com/ Aaaargh locked in there in Maths! Noooo! We forgot to sing the 'I will survive' song! Ack, I need new entertainment, Ally Mcbeal has finished and I'm boiling hot! Uhuh... oh and hungry! We had to play rounders at lunch time and we didn't get to eat any thing. :( Some one shouted out 'social rejects' apparantly... and darn proud of it! I didn't get to eat any of my dinner though, and then I got back home and found out it was all gone off! Eww! Does any one really care? That's my question, I'll go brew it.

Well no one's talking on msn cause they all like to eat giraffes instead and no I have no been eating monkeys. Sorry, need to get all the weirdness out of my system! Ahh... moral dilema day today but oh well it'll pass and it's not our problem alright guys! It's to do with Emily's birthday party. *sigh* Why does every one have to complicate things? Hmm... guess that'll go unanswered since we all do it! Ok here comes Lynne! Aaargh! I better go talk to her, wow pointless blog of the year!

      Hey well the meeting's over and let me go over some things... Well ok random stuff mostly! (Let's just pray that no one figures that they can get to this via my profile! Eeeek!) Any way, well first scary thing... these people that we knew were like hiding in the bushes! (Ok then) And then they came and *stood by us* at the exact same moment that me and Izzy had decided to go for a run... so we ran away and for some other reason every one followed us! Then when we got back they were still standing by people talking in their own little group! So we had two seperate groups even though they were standing by us... ok then... then they walked off. Other scary thing: Jon kind of coughed some thing about will you go out with me or some thing and I'm quite scared! Why is it that if you get close to some one they think that you like them like them? I think I've been through all this stuff before on blogger, yup, definatly! Grr, I forgot to get Emily a card! :'( Whoopsie, but I always do! Yeah I never get any one a card. Unless they kick me and tell me to remember to. Sorry, got nothing inside my head at the moment, it's one of those days. Otherwise known as a klutzathon!

Hmm... yeah, Izzy seethes with rage where as I kind of click about 2 hours afterwards and get angry for a streak. Then I just get rid of it and plot my revenge instead! :D Mmm, every one gets different kinds of angry! I figured out their and there, or Susie did... Their as in belonging to a person and There as in a place! Wow... it all makes sense... even though I've probably confused a load of people and every one else knew it any way! Mmm... I will shut up one of these days trust me! Hey we have to go to the disco and take the piss out of them cause that's what they're doing to us and we can do it to them! I remain the right to be pissed off... hmm, have to tell them that!

      Any way heloooo! I just got a bit freaked in music, some one told me that Jon likes me... Erm. I don't like him like that, only as a friend. Is it that when girls get close to boys they think they like them as boyfriends and not just as friends? Aaaargh this world and social thing is just way tooo confusing! That's why me and Izzy and every one have stayed out of it! Hehe... but seriously, hmm... And doesn't every one get that thing where they think they hear things? I always do so that's why I always ask people what they said. I'm not death! contrary to popular opinion though! Mmm, some one kick me back into sanity! Went a bit mad today... the WSL's came up to us and generally pratted about! Then I kind of shouted 'Bye WSL's' at them and now they're bugging us about what it means. They were being mean in the first place and why should they give a damn!!! Sorry... little bit pissed. These year 8's were kicking balls at us too! So me and Izzy had a plan to scream and run at them, or we could go 'ooga ooga ooga-shaka' and start dancing to freak them out! So I get all fired up and then they come over to us. Why don't they just fuck off? It's not that hard really! We've never done any thing to us but they feel that it's their right to continue to bug us until the end of time. FUCK OFF! Sorry... I might end up punching them next time though. Oh, and why am I apologising? Ok, ok, calm down... I will... some time. Hmm, better go watch tv to calm down... or take my anger out of a fighting game. YEAY! Kill people wooohooo! Wait a minute... it's not real life oh darn. oh well bubi!

      Mmm, I'm really relaxed now cause I'm listening to John Mayor... Ahh... Peace out dudes. Ok, ok so maybe I should wake up! But this is sooo relaxing... Ahh! Hmm, my brother's online, maybe thing's get more interesting! I just love being relaxed cause I'm so highly strung the rest of the time. My dad can't do forward or backward roles and neither can I! Ok, so I just threw that in then... That's why I spend so long in the bath, it's so relaxing! So is going to sleep, it gives you time to think. The only problem with me trying to get to sleep is that I usually do in about five minutes so I don't get a long time to think! We all need time to think, well I do cause otherwise I get all messed up! No seriously, I get all eggy and grr like! Hehe, angry Katie not good! I better 'go do shite all' downstairs (in the words of the smelly rikster). Hehe, Flatrick! (Patrick with Fl infront of it!) Ok, ok I'm going! Slightly maaaaaaaaaaaaaad! Go my minions take over the world! ...Gone bubi!

Well I've got one tip for you, Take the leap of faith!  Slight obsession with the leap of faith! All every one needs is some encouragment... and with me, a lot of fluke! I think I got a lot of fluke while I was doing the SATs! Oh noooo! I'm missing Neighbours! I'm gonna go watch it then I'll go play on Virtua Fighter 4. And you really care don't you!

      Heeeey welcome to the pink world. We all live in our own worlds, if you think about it! Well I do... inside my head! Okay, okay, I need help! We do, it's just hard to become a part of some one's world. (What are you thinking? Split personalities or plain madness?) Plain madness I didn't know you could get that! Mmm... I'm probably spelling that wrong but oh well! I think people get freaked out cause I'm so open with my thoughts (well some of them, I tend to leave out the murdering the WSL's). Hehe, but no one's open with their thoughts! Mmm... I'm rambling now aren't I? Ok, so big meeting on Saturday and any one can come! I reeealy don't care! I don't want people to feel left out. Owchie, my ancle kills! I put Emma's 4 inch high shoes on that are too small any way and I fell over pretty badly! Oh well... owchiiieee! Mmm, but I'll live! I think... Hmm we should get Ben C to hang with us if he's got no one. It's bad cause he was walking around on his own. No one should be on their own! Sorry, it's Katie's theory in life: Be nice to people and they will be nice to you. I kind of know what it's like to be on your own and it's not very nice! If only some one would reach out to those people! Ok, bit too moral? Maybe! I'll go muck around with sending Laura files be back!

Oh hail to the weird hippy who Izzy apparantly is. (We haven't figured out if it's just another one of her disguises yet!) Uhuh, so how's life the universe and every thing? Pretty much ok over here, apart from my mum says I should get more sleep... even though I sleep 9 hours! Oh and Izzy thinks she's stopped growing and she's all sad about it. Aww, poor Izzy. Guess you'll just have to join the Small Peopl Annonymous club, apart from you won't be annonymous cause you're small... Don't worry about it! I'ld rather be you're height! At least the boys aren't afraid that you might kick them by accident because your legs are sooo long! But hey you're not that small any way! Ahh I'm digging myself into a hole again! Eeeek better go do History homework. Go admaze yourself, do some thing you're afraid of doing.

Flick messed up Steph's wedding and Marc said that he loved her! :O Ok, so you reeealy get what I'm going on about I'm sure! Mmm... I'm hooked on a tacky song called Dreams Come True by S.E.S.

So I have nothing to talk about... oh, I got all 7's in SATs :P (You mean I have a brain!) No, we have a brain! It was all the extensive revising, oh and you telling me the answers was good. (Hehehe, well you might of thrown a strop if I didn't!) *Creeeeeeeek* Hey don't leave! *Yanks you back in* Ok so I am a bit weeeird but that's what make it so fun!

Mmm... well seeing as I couldn't really cope with ten minutes silence in geography a very long time! Oooh David ran around the field (400m) like 19 times! Geez he's waaaay to hyper. Hehe, we went mad today, for some reason these boys were galloping up and down the field and for an equally strange reason we joined them. Apart from Laura the depressed party pooper! Aww, some one *COUGH* was saying they thought Laura was depressed but I don't think she is, you gotta admit some bad stuff's been happening and we can't always be happy people! I hate that, you're either happy happy bouncy bouncy or you're depressed, their is no middle. Hmm... stop thinking? Hopefully some day I will, after that I'll do my homework! Ok so my cat wants to give me a hug. Bisi! I'll pick him up and trip down the stairs now... just incase you wanted to know that!

      Hmm... moral thinking. Daaah run! Yeah that would be a good thing to do. The point to life. Pretty deep huh? Well don't you think that every one's different, with a different point? Or maybe we've all got the same point. Maybe it's to enjoy yourself and help others, but not every one keeps to that so maybe they find a different point. Mmm... maybe I should shut up and stop saying maybe. Does any one else think this deep or are my brain patterns just that weird? I guess the fact that no one gets our humor might tell me some thing... I think out loud too much don't I? But that's a good thing to do otherwise those thoughts just fly past? More sleep needed? I think so! Bubi sorry for being deep today.

      Wow 7 people love this blog. What kind of web sites do YOU go on?!?!? Hehe, just kidding a bit zany right now cause I was playing on Silent Hill 2 and getting freaked out... My brothers friend left it here and I didn't have the box or any thing so I basically didn't know shit about it and was totally weirded out. (Kind of like what you're feeling now) :P Uhuh... hmm need to find a new freak out site cause this one's getting old! Hehe, gotta love the kick ass pink... ok, so you don't have to! Mmm... seriously needing to get out more! How dumb do some people think we are? Ok so I can't talk seeing as I recently took that test saying you're dumb as shit... but any way. Shits quite clever really it err can err smell... more than Laura, now that's not good but it's hard to do! :D Uhuh... lack of blogging getting to me! (More like lack of socializing) Now that's not trueee I had to spend a whole week with Izzy that was bad! I kept hearing things at night... hmm lack of sleep halucinating again? ...Probably! So better go take of the world *sigh* again. I'm too nice really to keep doing this job, killing just doesn't have the same zing now. I'm scared too don't worry I need to go to sleeeep.Ok, so I'm gonna go downstairs and watch Pride and Prejudice (geez you're weird) yeah I am so bubi guys! Tricky - You don't wanna, weirdest song in the whole world. Kind of disco techno jargon yeay! *kicks me out* Good! Bi!

         urlLink How dumb are  you ?  And darn proud of it!  You, my friend, are thick as pigshit.   Don't let it bother you. Some people have become extremely successful, while remaining the intellectual inferior of a lobotomised schnauzer (see it yap backwards!). Politicians, Hollywood movie stars, truckers and obese men driving white vans have all "made it" with your gargantuan stupidity. So don't fret: there is hope.   We advise you grow a giant moustache and go live in the country with your four dogs. There you will be allowed to shoot tin cans and shout "hooooeeeee" at nothing in peace

      I'll tell you about the mad man now, it's a psychological crappy thing basically. You have been warned!  Why do people go to the loo with some one else. It's cause they might be attacked! (Remember this is me, it's stupid) But by who? The mad man in the loo! So if you're gonna be attacked if you go to the girls loos then you should go to the boys loos. (I bet I'm spelling loos wrong! Loo's nope, oh well) But if you go to the boys loos you are the mad woman cause you're going to the boys loos! Stupid aye! And the point being... *sob sob* I just found out that my mum washed my hoodie. :( (YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT WASHED?) Nope! It felt so soft not washed! :'( (Eww... *takes a step back* DAMN! I'm attached to this body help!) Hehehe... err yeah. So any way, every one knows the coma thingy too? Nope? Good, good, thanks for the card Laura! That is soooo cool! My dad took one of my draws out of my wardrobe and he 'fixed' it and it won't go back in! So all my pants are all over my room! Yeaaah sure you wanted to know that, just warning you if you come over. Mmm... tea time, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna blog again! Some people have been bitchy and I need to tell people what I think. Hmm, I do that way too often don't I? Some times the things that I think are way to weird. *eerie silence* Ok then bibi!

      Greeeeeeeeeat Beki, just a few posts! I tried to post last night but it wouldn't let me, sorry guys. :( YEAY WE'RE BACK! Sorry, err I really should wake up some time soon... Actually my legs should wake up cause I pulled the same muscle *can't spell it and don't care* in both legs and they kill! It's like having cement legs. Owchie, but I'm not beaten yet! Ahh, Okehampton was fun. Yeah, we did rock climbing and I am very proud that I actually trusted you guys when I absailed down (hardest bit) :P. Aaargh but mountain biking eeek! (Sorry about spelling again, but I'm sooooo tired I didn't sleep last night.... or the night before so eeeugh) We had to cycle 7 miles! Every one else did 6 but the guy was nice to us and he took us the long way. Me and Beki fell over and we're both covered in cuts and bruises. Aaah, real music thank god! We had to listen to tacky stuff at the youth hostel cause that's all their was, also Izzy had to dance to S Club 7! Ahahaha! That's funny! We danced to Alice DJ?... Well I don't know! We did the harder one! We were supposed to perform it at this disco but we didn't, instead we moshed all the time, first Rosie and people were like OMG SAD! but then they left us alone cause they stood their and did nothing and we just bounced about! That's why my legs killll! Ooh, we went swimming and their was this massive 'Wobsticle' thing in the middle of the pool and you had to get across it. I went on about twise. Straight on and straight off. Fun! So me and Beki went evil and tried to get every one off! MUHAHAHAHA! Izzy was in a seperate half and almost all the people in her group got across because you couldn't try to get them off. In our group about 3 people got across! Heheheee! It was fun! Erm, what else. Oh yeah, water sports, we did kyaking *shoot me for spelling* (hey when do I get to talk) *shoots the other head* ahhh better. Kyaking was soooo much fun! At the beginning Beki fell in! Hehehe, and I was going round in circles but by the end of it I was going straight! :O :O :O I was shocked! Then afterwards me and Emma jumped in! It was soooo cold! We also did sailing and I had to sit on the front of Emma's boat! First she couldn't steer and the sail kept swining over to her side and the whole boat tipped on it's side! But we didn't fall in! (Sadly) So I got a bit more confident sitting on the front so I let go and sat facing the water. Then Emma tried to kill us by going over to the wier! So the guy came over and I had to lay on my front and try to paddle! I looked sooo dumb! Then I had to grab hold of his boat and we were dragged away! I had to do that a lot actually... So then I tried to steer and I went round in a circle then straight into the mud! Hehe, fun! Geez, this is gonna be one long blog! Ahh the food was actually reeeally nice! Wow! I had jelly every night! It actually tasted quite gross by the end of it... Oh, also we bought a load of sweets even though I took a load of food! Mmm... my throat hurts, and it sounds really bad cause I've been blabbering away all week non stop! (Ask Izzy I have!) Oh night walking was fun... apart from it wasn't dark and their was a load of goat shit every where! Pony treking hurt cause I'm not used to it! Owchie, my knees kind of gave in. Oooooh, gorge scrambling best thing in the world! Ok, ok, so wet suits are horrible but it was fun! I slipped over about 3 times but I was fine I felt totally safe. We did silly games, and I had to put 20 skittles into a cup using a straw! it was fun, I'll let every one else blab about what they did cause I'm taking up way to much space! Ok, so I'll post this and type another one after it, check back in 10.

      Hey... and AHHHHHHHHHHH! I just came back from watching 8 legged freaks (sorry, you didn't star in it, that would be 3 legged freaks :P) It was sooo scary! I didn't jump though! Ok, ok, so I jumped in the adverts before it! (I always do that!) I really should stop doing that... Any way it was really cool and no, I'm not afraid of spiders after it... although I'm kind of freaked because I'm all alone at home... and I came home and all the lights were off! Major AARGH factor going on! I'm better now... I put Metallica on and the phone's by me. Not that I'm expecting massive spiders or any thing... AAARGH! GET IT OFF ME! Hee just fooling, I wouldn't really have time to type that if I was being eaten you know! (Oh yeah, 'Excuse me, Mr I Want To Eat You, Spider, sir, could you wait until I post this and then eat me? Oh really? Thank you, be with you in a sec.') Wow, that's one nice Mr I Want To Eat You, have I met him? *groan* Any way, I found this!  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020829/80/d8gsn.html  Geez, they must be getting desperate for news! And for all you still at school this is for you - HAHA SUCKERS! Hehe, just spreading a little festive spirit! Bisi!

      Mmm... I was just watching Newsround (as you do) and they were seeing what people though of Slipknot and every one was saying they're really bad and they can't understand why they call that music! Excuse me! That is music, and if you lot actually got a life and some friends you might find out about it! I'm really good ;) (yeah right) no I mean that I try to respect different types of music, and not just shun them because I don't like them. Just because you don't like a type of music does that give you a right to condemn it? To decide that it's rubbish? I try not to do that because I hate narrow minded people... Ahhh hyper phase! Damn, I'm getting too almightily passionate about this, mind you I am! Mmm... might be the music and the pills I just took as well... did I say pills? *sweat sweat* Hehe, nah, I don't do that. Just pulling your leg. (Hey! Give it back!) Hmm... really need some psychiatric help! Ok Bubi! Keep on head banding guys! (What was that about narrow mindedness?) Aaah, tea! Bi!

I guess... any way the skin isn't Italian so it's ok. But it doesn't tell you how to install it! (And for a dumb person like you, boy was it hard!) Yeah yeah... well... it was! So I walked around and got to here  urlLink http://www.winamp.com/nsdn/winamp2x/dev/skins/zip.jhtml  *dumdadeee link girl!* Well yeah, I don't explain stuff well ya know!

Well... only a little bit. Hmm... I'm gonna run around down stairs for a bit so my brain can frizzle out of overload. Yeay! (Freak them out why don't you?) Yup, that's what I do!

Mmm... chocolate... hehe uhoh... am I going to see eight legged freaks today or tomorrow? Erm! ERM!

Aargh, I need to get out of this house! I'm getting all cranky and every one's decided to bug me! Fun aye? Hmm... my dad's about to have his head amputated if he tried to kick me off one more time.

Oh, I've also demoulded the bathroom, which involved putting purple stuff in the bits between the tiles with a toothbrush, then washing it off with a cloth then a wet toothbrush. Oh, then 'polishing' it with a dry cloth! Aaargh! my arm kills, and that took ages too! So less bored now, did any one else see Neighbours? Random question, but yeah...

Ok, I'll go get some ear drops (dermatitus again) *sigh* it's always some thing isn't it? Wow, cool thought! If I chopped off my head then that would just hurt and it would hurt so much that I wouldn't care about any thing else! (Yes, you wouldn't care because you would be DEAD) Ah, slight techinical hitch, hmm, suicide isn't on my list so guess I'll have to think of some thing else...

Ok, so first we went for a long walk... into the middle of nowhere, like usual then we got covered in ants and walked back! Fun! Then we posed... and people stared (I was drinking ribena from a wine glass!) Scary huh? Oh, and yeah, it has a wine carrier on it! Mad! Just listening to Boy Hits Car, I'm totally gona! Woohooo! Hmm, some one didn't spike my drink did they? Mmm... so any way, then we walked up a big big hill! Soo steeeeep! Instead of going my way around, then we got stuck and had to leg it over a fence! Ooh, fun! Hmm, how was every one else's days? You're all on holiday! :'( It's just me! How depressing... and... boring! Hehe, you have to get back and save me from myself!

Mmm... god, we're going 'national trust place to go' hunting today! Yeay! Seeing as it's bank holiday and no one's working... this should be fun! Hmm, I need to think of things to do, still gotta de-rust Reg. Oh, and then I've gotta de-mold the bathroom (woohoo!) and paint or wallpaper or some thing... I have the best life, huh? Not really, but then no one does. Is it me or is it freezing cold? Ok, ok, so anemic girl might not be the best one to ask about the temperature. (Permenantly freezing) Ok, so I'm going weird again (I thought you were permenantly weird) wear pink people!

      Hey! Ok, so warning to you lot who want to stay alive, never go to Cadbury Camp with my mum! She's like supremo 'don't worry i bet if we keep walking another say six miles then we'll get some where' and 'every road leads to home'! We went to Cadbury camp and ended walking about two miles to nowhere and found ourselves just down the road, apparantly we'd walked around in a big circle! Ooh fun! Then we made dad buy some strawberries *I'm having a very bad spelling day!* and then we walked back. Oh, I forgot to mention... OW MY KNEES! They kill, most of it was up and down hill, not flat and my knees hate that! (They're very particular) Any way, then my foot started hurting and it got very stupid, I'm okay now (I took some drugs) Yeay for drugs! Oook so slightly hyper... and bored! Come on people de-bore me! Mmm... nooo MORIS DANCERS! Can't... take... it... zzz... (Random huh?)

Muhahahaaa! *cough cough cough* Geez, all this fake coughing is getting to me in my old age. (14 is old age?) Well... yeah... I gues... (...not...) Ok, so it isn't but it seems old to me cause I've only been alive for 14 years so I don't really know and longer periods of time! (I'm sure that could of been put better with about three words but what the heck.) Hmm... we could always try to find Jon's house again! (We did that when he didn't come into Nailsea to meet us so we could go to Bristol *breathes*) Fun aye! I think I thought of some thing we could do in a dream... can't remember it though. I'm guessing it would have some thing to do with machine guns and killer teddy bears... maybe we couldn't doing that seeing as there are no killer teddy bears and my dad confiscated my machine gun. :'( *sob sob* So sad! (Weeeeeird!) Hey shut up! You're not even sure how to spell weird/wierd! (Neither are you!) Draw. *freaks of nature!* Thanks. I better go, I'm getting weird by the minute and I haven't had dinner yet! Sooo hungry! Bubi!

Bullets bend around pipes and/or rabbit holes. 7. Explosives only singe your hair. 8. Gravity is slower to take effect. 9. Anvils fall from the sky. 10. You can survive a nasty fall off the grand canyon. 11. Adults only have legs, and you never see their torso. 12. Bombs are always clearly labelled 'bomb'. 13. You eat sandwiches by swallowing them whole. 14. The local community contains an extraordinary high percentage of 	   	megalomaniacs trying to take over the world. 15. Your lifelong enemy is a mouse. 16. Your body can concertina back into shape after being run over. 17. You keep a dinosaur as a pet and nobody minds. 18. There are violins and glockenspiels wherever you go. 19. The animals talk, but the humans don't. 20. A rabbit or a duck the size of fully grown man is considered normal. 21. You don't need breathing apparatus to breathe in outer space. 22. Your pet cat is far smarter than you. 23. People with no fingers can pick things up? 24. You have a wardrobe packed full of the same outfit, and are not considered deranged. 25. Traps only work when YOU try them.  Hee cool aye? I got it sent from Cartoon Network! Not that er... I'm on their mailing list or any thing! *cough cough gurble* Eww! Flem! Hmm, maybe all this fake coughing isn't good for me! Ooh, ok so link to Cartoon Network so they think twise before crashing down on me with a load of lawyers *can't spell!*  urlLink http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk  Oooh, and I got my poem into a book!

      Oooh! Story time kiddies.  It was a dark and lonely night... (why do all my stupid stories start with some thing like that?) Mmm... actual crappy story! (Boo!) Hey that one was probably gonna be crap any way. (Good point) I was on the phone to Izzy and the next door neighbours dog was rolling all over our front lawn! It was covered in mud so I very bravely opened the front door and it stood and stared at me so I shut it. (Woos) Yup! Then it came over to the door and started barking! I was gonna get Izzy to come and scare it away if it didn't go but it did. But still, damn scary! (Yawn) Okay, okay.  It was a dark and lonely night and the tomato ketchup bottle had been walking for miles, he needed a refill and it was only a few centimetres to the factory but still, it seemed like a far way to him. He was about to go into the factory when a fat policman pulled up in a car and picked him up... Okay, this is going nowhere! Bubi!

We bought Hagen Das *whatever* well, actually two lots and I'm sooo full! I also cooked this pizza, and it came out burnt but the cheese still wasn't cooked! Aargh! I'm trying to finish off Izzy's miniture golf game, she's got 38 on this hole with a par of 4 and I can't do it! Ah, might as well round it up to a nice number like... say.... 50? Hehe, Izzy is +43 up! Wow, I actually putted it! Hehe... I gave up, I got stuck with Izzy's ball again, I think it's hoaxed! Or maybe the smell waves coming off it make it too big to go in the hole! Heee! Aren't I clever? Mmm... now for taking over the world, I'm really gonna have to do that some day.

      Any way, sorry I'm hyper! I had eight hours sleep last night and I've been having soooo much coke! Did you know that over in Spain six bottles of beer is £1?!?! I mean WOW! So Spain was really hot and nice! We were staying in Maro near Nerja (Ner-ha... my Dad kept coming up with jokes about that *sigh*) The place we were staying in was really nice too and we had our own pool! Posh! The only problem was it was boiling hot! We took siestas *fancy word for nap* in the middle of the day cause otherwise you melt and then did stuff for the rest. All the families were in Nerja at about 9:00 still! Geez, that's like start of drunken time in Bristol. It was nice doing that and we saw street art like dancing and flame breathing (well blowing but what the hell) and this statue guy (greeeeat). Oh, I've caught more of my brother's weird humour and I've got even weirder cause I'm reading Catch 22 which is really weird but funny! Oh, btw Shiva is this God for some religion or other (or is it demi-god?) and I think she does have eight arms, she's also the cool ice gf on FF. :D Not that I know that... Uhuh, but I'm sure you know that! All the food was lush in Spain and I tried squid! It was all chewy and hard! Hehe, freak out guys! Oh, and you lot can't have Pringles cause they've got some type of animal fat in them or some thing! My brother said that and he knows! I'm not gonna eat them any way cause apparantly they burn really quickly which means they have a load of energy in them (ie fat and sugar mmm) Have you guys been doing get togethers and including every one? Oooh, I haven't seen Jon online for ages! Is he avoiding me or some thing? Oh, I bought some tacky Spanish music! Yeay! I'll gp put it on! Oh yeayyyy! Isn't this fun! Hehe, sorry slightly weird, I'll go phone one of you or some thing to arrange some thing now!

And I'm typing so slowly cause I've been off this thing for two weeks... nooo! So Laura did you have a nice Birthday? Like the present? We still haven't got my mum one and Rik's gone out (big surprise) oh no, I forgot I've got to deal with all my e-mails. Great! Geez... online farmacy?!?! Ooh, I got you prezzies! (I want to keep them!) *grinz evilly* Hehe... I mean no I didn't! ERM! Shit, I've got this e-mail about signing up for some crap called Max Group B2B Services when I was in Spain...

      Aww poor laura! Can we call you Gappy? On the subject of potato cuisine...do you think that moulding a lump of mashed potato into the shape of a slice of bread, covering it in flour and putting it in the toaster would be a healthy alternative to toast?  I've been wallpapering today - yay!! Laura you should have your screen name as Respect Potatoes! (how did i get from potatoes to wallpapering and back to potatoes again? Weird.) I'm doing a paperround on weekday mornings this week. It sucks. They even had the nerve to phone me up at 5:30pm and ask if I could to an evening round all week too, after bullying me into the one in already doing. "Hi Izzy, can you pleeeease do me a big big fav-" No! "Pleeeease do an evening round for me this week-" NO! "Oh go on-" NO NO NO! "Ok then bye." I'm telling you, I'm quitting after next week, I have seriously had enough of this sucky job. (Did you ever used to do potato printing when you were a kid?) My mum is obbsessed with the TV series "24" . Theres been 24 hour-long episodes and the series is set over 24 hours. Apparently its good, but my mum (being my mum) watched 23 episodes...all except the last one! She woke up at 6:30 this morning and goes - "Oh god, I've missied the last episode of 24!" But luckily theres a repeat on today, and theres been a sticky note on the TV since 8:30am saying - "Don't miss last espisode of 24 repeated at 10:30pm" ! Talk about obsessive! (Have you ever realised how nice potatoes are?) Aww -  Malcom in the middle was sooooo funny. Ive downloaded the theme tune by They Might Be Giants. I've downloaded some of there other stuff. They're pretty cool. Potatoes...potatoes.... Oh thanks a lot Laura!

      hello i have'nt blogged in two days. how terrible. the veggie meal sounds fun. potato,leek and cheese is one of my favourite combinations.seriously the whole of the universe should eat potatoes i think. they are my very favourite food cos you can make all the best stuff out of them. chips (mmmmmmmmm), crisps, roast potatoes, mashed potato (mmmmm), potato waffles, potato alphabites, potato happy smilies, umm, potato soup (which i think sounds weird but it's actually really yummy) and a whole lot of other stuff (basically i'm runnin out of ideas) oh yeah, jacket potatoes. this is like respect the potatoes. cool.  hey i did'nt know you could get chocolate cactuses! (cadbury's chocolate, get it?) okay so unfunny thing of the year. i think shiva is actually a really cool name for a cactus with eight arms. about ice skating i dont know when but not tuesday cos i have to go to the awfuldontist. do you that since i've had my brace theres a gap between my two bottom teeth that was'nt there before. correct me if i'm wrong but is'nt a brace supposed to mend gaps not MAKE THEM?

Brendan came home from Cadbury's with some cactuses - "One's called Shiva because it has eight arms - " Right... "- And the other one's called Spike." Hehe, I remember having a cactus when I was 6 - i called it FFFFGGGGHHH! Don't ask why!

      Happy Birthday Laurapooos! Hope you're having a good one, sorry I wasn't there, it's 5pm and I got back about an hour ago!! Maybe we can do somefink tomorrow? Sounds like you've been having fun anyway.  You know you mentioned something a while ago about wanting to learn to rollerblade in the summerhols? We should sooo do that this week and next week too! I'm off to La France in two weeks, and I have noooo money left so I'm not really sure how I'm gonna survive in France with all the amazing shops, or how I'm gonna get my hands on a pair of rollerblades for that matter.  Anyway, Eastbourne was ok, they have some pretty cool shops (does she ever talk about anything else??) but god - everyone is so damn SLOW in Eastbourne! Not just the elderly people, I'm telling you, EVERYONE just crawles along at the pace of a snail!   Hmmm..what else happened...oh yeah my dad's bike got nicked (oh dear) and the insurance company is being shitty...I got a cool new top! Its blue and it looks like it's had paint thrown all over it! Brendan is making me laugh sooo much - he's convinced that if he screws his face up and concentrates very hard he can make his hair stand on end (weird kid). Oh yeah, and you have to read  Coram Boy  by Jamila Gavin, it is soooooo good. I spent a whole day reading it from beggining to end and I cried at the end soooo much! :'(  *Tries to imagine Lynne reading it* Arghh!  We saw these distant relatives that I've never met before who seemed to remember me, and I was sitting there seething silently and felt like an animal in the zoo "Aww isn't she pretty!" Give me a break, just because you can't think of anything to say!! I'd have given anything at that moment for a sign that said  - "Don't bang on the glass" to hang round my neck.  Got back to find a postcard from Beki -   "Hello Izzy - gone a bit mad in Scotland (I danced around the co-op.) Scotland is totally amazing, I saw an otter AND a golden eagle in the  wild ! Oh, and doesn't the picture just shout - "Mr.Nutbrown" !  - Trekkie"  The picture on the front is an old statue of Robert the Bruce! Erm, whatever you say Beki...

      heloo guys, it sounds like theres been some very weird stuff goin on while i've been on the moon. yeh they have great cheese there this time of year. nah i've been in italy. you all kept saying that you did'nt know where i was so i thought i'd tell ya. italy was soooooo nice. it was really warm and we went swimming in the lake and then we went to verona and saw the ampthitheatre (or however you spell it) we did'nt go in though. we went to the dolomites which was really amazing and we had to go up all this seriously windy roads in a coach to get there which was a bit scary (understatement of the year) and then we got to go on this cable car that takes you up to the highest bit. i was shit scared at the beginning but after that it was really cool.  i read all the blogs you wrote while i was away and got scared but thought that the model animation thing sounded like SO much fun. and i want to see it. we all have to do somethin sometime, like when everyones back from holiday and everythin we should all go to bristol and stuff. when does everyone get back though cos i've been back for almost two days now and have'nt been out of the house and it's bloody raining again it was absolutley pissing it down earlier (or as my dad likes to say,peeing it down) it even rained in italy for the last couple of days. if it rains on my birthday i'm just gonna go out and dance in it.  so i dont really know when you all get back so i'm just gonna keep bloggin on here for a while. oh i just realised i just talkin to myself if ur all away. i guess i kinda am anyway, i like to talk to myself though. dont always listen but... nevertheless... oh dear my mums singin in the kitchen. scary. and theres no escape cos it echos all over the house when you sing in our kitchen. that song sounds cool. i have'nt downloaded it yet but i will. have'nt heard anything from trevor in a while, probably planning some kinda major attack. oh dear my mum and sister appear to be getting over excited about whizzing tomatoes up in the blender. thats when you know you're realy losing it.

      Oooh, note for Laura! Download Trevor's Pole by Lubby Nuggett oh and don't ask! Bit of a weird name, but it's the one that says don't trust any one named Trevor! Thought you might appreciate it more than me seeing as your neighbours and every thing.... Get your mum to listen to it! Ahh, I'm so happy, we won't have to cope without music or tv in spain! They have a tv and a cd player so we're taking a load of cd's! Oh, the cats have gone. :'( Mango was trying to escape out of the basket and he was hogging all the room! Cleo was squashed up in the corner some where and Mango was just going mad. I don't think they wanted to leave us! Aww, how cute... Or maybe some one forgot to feed them this morning...? Mmm... well Broadie was sitting silently so I think they had been fed. Aww, I'm leaving for two weeks! (Duh!) Hmm, I'll miss every one! I better go.... do what I do...? Bubi!

Mmm... that could be good, it would make my job a lot easier! Aww, I'm gonna be gone tomorrow! I'm gonna miss my cats and my bunny! I'll miss my friends too! Yeah, I always do. I always do this thing about what'll happen if the plane crashes or some thing like that, you won't get to say goodbye but I think that you don't need to say goodbye because people should know how you feel about them. Hey I'll have fun taking over Spain. Sorry went a bit deep then and I couldn't see the bottom! Ok so I'll go stew some oak (EH?) busi!

Pointless blog! Erm, oh, wanted to say that I completely support putting the EAD races in with the able bodied races. Yeay! Any way, it stinks that they don't do that usually! So every one, pease, love and support the EAD races in the Commonwealth Games!

      So hey! Actually... we're going tomorrow! No one told me! Well, ok, they did but usually these days my head is swimming and I only take a bit in. Unless I concentrate a lot. Great now I sound like a bimbo! Erm... any one heard of pink cheese? (Rubbish subject change, real rubbish) I try my best! :D I'm gonna go watch the triatholon *whatever* now cause we're actually winning it! I seriously need a holidiay, I'm so grouchy! Well, slight other reason for that but any way. Ever noticed that cheese is actually pink? *sigh* (You tried that already) Right, right, just checking if you were watching/listening! My brother has a leather *whatever* jacket! and some sandles, he bought them yesterday! Slight difference, I mean boiling hot jacket and freezing cold sandles...? Mmm, but any way the jacket was £20 cause it had a rip in it but the man said you can fix it back together with tip-ex! Okay, okay I'm going! Bubi peeeps! *sob sob* See you in either two weeks or see you tomorrow! I might go on the net on Spain... but I'll probably be extra hyper and happy! (Scary!)

Unless the little green men happen to have a shrinking product... no? Oh well *sigh* Hey if I do get a .nu (not this again) I'll have to have a 'adopt a little green man' thing! Then if your page goes wrong you can blame it on the little green man! Ooh, fun! And I could have different pictures, like on of him hanging over a fire... and different stuff! Hehe, feeling evil again! I'm gonna be unleashed *whatever* on Spain at some thing like 8 o'clock their time tomorrow! Yeay! We're heading to the airport at 2 and knowing my Dad the plain probably takes off at 4 or some thing... *sigh* Any way they're an hour ahead so think of me! I will, listen to Manu Chao, I am it's setting me into the Spanish mood. I'll think of you while I'm swimming outdoors in the sun. :D (*shivers* horrible mental image) Hey the sun isn't that bad! (No, you in a swimming costume!) HEY! GRR! Remind me why I don't just chop you off. (Err... because of my devilsh good looks?) Grr... (Because I eat all the food you don't like...) Ok, deal, but I'm still mad! MUPPETS!!! AAARGH! Ahh... better... I'm goona go bisi!

Any way, I'll be checking that out on babble fish unless I find that I can go without needing the loo for two weeks... ok, straight to babble fish! Mmm... hehe, I'm gonna have fun looking for tacky presents for you lot! (You better get me one too!) Hehe, might get Izzy some Spanish thing and watch her try and translate it! Ooh, I'm feeling evil! What are we gonna do about Laura's birthday present? How are we gona give it to her? Oh well, I guess it's okay if you give it to her Izzy, you can tell me the reaction! Laura, you better practise your 'wow this is great' thing, because you're gonna need a lot of practise with what we got you! Hey, no one's here, well my Dad is but he's asleep. He's mega stressed from work and I have a feeling that we all need this holiday! Every one needs a holiday, especially when you go to our school with those certain lovely lettuces who feel it is their constant duty to remind us how much we need to get away from them. Yep, ultra nice people aren't they, to remind us alllll the time. (Little too much on the sarcasm.) Oh, I'm sorry, have a block of gold. (*raises eyebrow* Forgot to take the pills again, huh?)

      Yeay! Holiday! Have a fun time Izzy, oh and sorry little green men but this won't be updated for like milleniums cause I'm away for two weeks and Izzy's away for a week! We don't quite know where Laura is... Me and my brother have kind of mucked up, we both forgot to get my Mum a birthday present and her birthday's during the holiday (9th) but she wants one from England! So we're kind of throwing a few ideas together and trying to get her Shrek! She's wanted it for ages, wow, another stupid kiddy video to add to our collection! Yeay! Mmm... we are quite dumb with presents at our house. Hey wow Izzy, you got one of those flying cars? Wow... that would be ...weird, wouldn't that be a weird sort of aeroplane?

      Ok....Katie you definately need that holiday. I'm off to visit relatives today (woo-diddlie-hoo) and I'll be there for a WHOLE WEEK! Arghhh, I think I need shooting more than Katie. I might end up inundating you with texts, Katie, sorry I'll be very very bored. Bleugh, a whole week of making endless cups of tea. Hehehehe, you'll be having fun in Spain I guess, trying to ask some Spanish amigo where the nearest loo is ("Que?").  Well whatever happens, it can't be as bad as the last time we went to France. We all got headlice and had to go into a French pharmacy and ask for head-lice conditioner - "Erm...tu as le..le shampoo pour les petit, erm...petit things dans ma chevuax...dans la tete...erm...???" And then the French guy slammed this bottle on the counter (apparently) as if to say - "Get out of my country, you filthy English."!  Anyway, erm well see you in about three weeks, because I don't think any of our holidays co-incide, (what are we going to do about Laura's birthday???) and erm, have fun! I'm just about to get in the car and fly...fly to...Eastbourne. Great.

      Heeey, my computer's got a blank screeny bit on the bar at the bottom and it won't go away. (I'm my usual confusing self.) Computer's have spaces in them, to be full with information. (Uhoh, now she's going moral) Like us, I guess, we have gaps in our brains,  some larger than others Izzy  and when we learn they are filled. (WARNING: Moral overload) We have gaps for emotions, personally my evil one's full at the moment, being a evil three headed monkey isn't all fun you know, I have evil paper work to do and stuff! (Ok, so it's subsided *whatever that means* in to weirdness, well, it's normal for me!) Ahh... music relaxes me so much, nothing else does! That's why I love playing the piano... how ...interesting... I'll go hide with some orange juice! Time to drink! (God, that's hard stuff you're drinking) Yeah, but I don't care! Ha! I'm a self confessed *whatever that means too* orange juice adict! *shock* Ok, I'm seriously going bubi!

      Geez no one's shot me yet, I'm disappointed in all of you. Uhuh, I've been around my brother for too long! Well, he came home today so that means I've been around him for about three hours, seeing as he left. Three hours is waaay too long to be around him! His madness catches and we usually end up doing stupid stuff and blaming it on irish logic, ahh how weird. Ahh! I'm gonna be stuck with him for two weeks! Oh well, guess I'll just have to bribe him with chocolate like I did last year. Or tie him up... *grins a evil grin evilly* (How much grin and evil can you fit into one sentance?) If I was to grin an evil grin evilly then I'd evilly grin the evil grin with as much evil grin as I evilly could. (I had to ask) and I had to tell! *badumchee* See what I mean? And only after three hours! Ahh, I've had this up for ages time to click post & publish kiddies. Bisi!

      Hi guys! Do you need a moral lift? Or are you just confused? (Cut the sales gimmic, no one's here any way.) Riiight, I'm talking to myself again *sigh* comes to some thing when you start doing that.  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=880217  Every one say 'oh god not again, katie wrote a poem late at night and it's deep and meaningful' YEAY! Hehe, well actually I'm having a lot of trouble getting to sleep, I start off too cold and end up too hot! So I usually end up reading or writing but then I figure it's 12 and I have to be up at 8, that's always a bummer. Hey, I'm kind of going freaky on fanfiction, yeay I'm putting my weird Ant story on! (That should keep em running) :D Spread the freakiness people! (Even though I'm doing a good job by myself).

I need to de-rust this metal sheep called Reg and I need to write out a load of Spanish, kick some guys ass on FFX and give Broadie a hug. (You really had to think to ask, didn't you?) Hehe, they didn't! Well... their's no out out there and unless the little green men have come back again! HEY! COME BACK WITH MY COUNTER! *beats them with a citrus flavoured HTML script* Hehe, that should teach them! Hey... don't go... Or do, it's your choice, as far as I know (which is about 2cm of sugar tape) this is still a free country and hey, we're not in Iraq are we? Well... I hope we aren't! Hmm... maybe some people came and picked up the house and flew it over to Iraq? Maybe my imagination is too big... Hehe, that would be funny! Imagine seeing a house fly past! Ok, so now they picked it up and started flying, it was stupid in the first place! Oh Izzy! Mr Fopple!  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020802/140/d6koc.html  Things get a bit freaky don't they... I'm gonna go hug Broadie!

      Hihooo! I worked out what happened to the flooble box! (Uhoh, extra long weird story time huh?) Yup! :D Well... these little green men came onto the page and ripped it out leaving a massive hole, they then took it deep into the depths of the internet where they probed it for information on walabys (come on stick with it even if it is pointless and has crap spelling) Aha, but their's no hole in the page you see? Well, what happened is a pink bunny came along and looked at the hole, it then proceeded to jump in the hole so the hole was gone! However the pink bunny wasn't big enough so a load of termites came along and force fed it pumpkins. They then sped up time and the bunny filled the gap, then a big lasar shot the bunny and the hole completely disappeared! :O! Poor bunny! (Geez I'm weird) Sorry, haven't taken my pills today! Bubi!

(Aaargh!) Hehe, so fuuun! I've been on a creative day today! I tried to tidy my room but I ended up making it into a creative mess! Yeay! I had ska music on, my red light and I was actually cleaning up my room - it was madness! But no one's phoned and saved me from myself! :'( Usually I have to answer the phone about a billion times and it's never for me any way! Oh well. Mmm... now I'm halucinating the doorbell and the phone! Oh yeay! ...without even taking drugs, god aren't I admazing! (Not amazing!) Better go sit downstairs so I can pass the door and make sure I'm not going crazy!

Erm I don't think you can do that thing with Fushigi Yuugi (it's written like that cause of the hat over the u) It apparantly doesn't exactly mean Mysetious Play, it means some thing else... or some weird thing like that. And it might have all that stuff with Yuugi can only be put there and there are loads of meanings for play... you know, crappy french type things. (No offence to French people, it's just our teacher's crap) Mmm... but I don't speak Japanese so I wouldn't know!

      Ok, wait a minute - If "Fushigi Yugi" ("The Book") means "Mysterious Play" , then can we go around saying - "Wasn't William Shakespere a great yugiwrite?" ? and "Wow, Mr.K's written a yugi." And "The cause of Katie's mental state is an unsolved fushigi." ? Nah. Ok well it was worth a try.

      OMG  - "The Book" *beam of light breaks through clouds* was SOOO GOOD! I read it in HALF AN HOUR!! (Nuriko's a man!!) Oh god, I'm gonna be stuck all weekend going - "I want the third one!" Katie - Get the fourth one in Bristol!!! They're so good and easy to read, you could just sit in the shop and read a whole one in one go and you'd be done before they could notice! Awww I wish I could come tomorrow but I'm at orchestra, and I've got loads of catching up to do from being ill. Newshop guy phoned and asked if I could do a round on saturday mornings - ("Yes! Thankyou orchestra!") Ahhh I'm in demand. Speaking of orchestra - sorry, but - HOLY SHIP! I have an ASSESSMENT (I don't think I can even spell asses...assess...ases...a-asess...(ah heck) -  the word  . argh) tomorrow!!! Smellllllllll..... AND I've gotta get going on my music coursework - first composition has to be in by December 18th. Oh it's cool - me and Laura and Beki and Jen (and everyone) at school orch get to dress up as vampires for another one of Mr.Kelly's overly-eccentric school productions *cringes at memories of Piratemania. Eugh.* Is it me or is everything about music right now? Heheh, English was so funny. I had to take a role infront of the class and be questionned by everyone. You could have fried an egg on my face.

      Any way onto happier things... Harry Potter... Or Harry Peter as the Spanish copiers like to call it! (Go them! Bypass copyright law!)  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020927/80/daka5.html  Aparantly people are booking for the cinema tickets already. Has it come to a point where no one really cares how good it is, just that 'I've seen it'? Hasn't it become more like a fashionable thing to do, and every one's got to like it. Does any one really care about how good the film is? I thought the first one was crap! I thought Lord of the Rings was admazing though! I wouldn't buy the Harry Potter film, and I openly say that. I honestly also thought the fourth book was crap. But it seems to of become a second bible, and the moment any one says any thing about how it's bad they're some how doing a bad thing, aren't we supposed to share our oppinions? Ok, so I might not be the best person at explaining things, but do you still get the gist of what I'm saying? Mmm... I'll go run back into my hole *snatches some monster munch*, can't survive without them!

      One other thing... all this stuff about designing your own child, would you? Say you did, would your child be happy knowing that they were what  you  wanted, not what  they  wanted. Would they have a right to blame you if some thing bad happened to them because of their looks? And say you didn't. Say that they thought they were fat and ugly and every one else was perfect. Would they not then blame you for not deciding to design them and make them thin and pretty - all the things we supposedly want. If they were dumb and you could have chosen to make them clever would they blame you? Surely it would get stupid because every one would be stupidly clever. Who would be left to do all those jobs that every one does for a holiday job when they're a teenager? These jobs still have to be done. Maybe robots will do it, but then the electricity is needed and we're polluting our environment enough as it is. In the future are we going to solely depend on robots? Will we rot away in our houses never doing and exercise or any work that requires moving? Will socializing be done over holographic phones so you need not go any where? What happens if all the robots break, then how will we survive? Will we again rot away, what ever we choose. Will I ever shut up? (Sorry had to add that in, stupidly long string of questions!) I strive to think so others need not. I help others think so I may not. I try to do both, so questions have answers. (EH? Ahh well... bubi!)

      Let me get philosphical with you. (Geez, really should learn how to spell, it kind of backs up that intelligent look.) Eeek! Some one looks intelligent??? Any way, back to serious (riiight) I should stop reading those Jostein Gaardner books they make me go all phsychological! *is that right?* Well... look at this  urlLink http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,545653,00.html  Or read on... I don't really care, I'm happy in my pink haven. :) (Really needing to get out more) Do you think robots will take over the world? (LOL!) Sorry, sounds sooo stupid! Well... robots don't have a consciousness right? So they have no desires or needs, they don't hate or love, so why should they want to or ever get that idea into their heads? It would have to be planted by a human and they would have to be trained to kill, they would never want to because they would never be able to want any thing. So basically... in theory if they were programmed to they could... But some one would have to programme them, and the machines that make them, and the transport. If that person died then where would we be? However you look at it, a human would have to be behind every robot. Was the egg not before the chicken? Ahh... I have no more thoughts on this subject (cause I'm tired and ill) so say what you want in my meaningless void of silence.

      Okay, I just got a damn scary e-mail! First of all it started off by saying 'Dear Sir' Sir? I'm a girl thank you very much! I suggest that you don't call me Sir unless you have a sudden liking to kerosene. Then it went on to say some thing about 'I got your impressive information through the chamber of commerce and industries on foreign business relations here in Lagos' EH? What the hell is Lagos and information? I'm a 14 year old girl for bob's sake! Then it said 'The said amount was USD 12.5 M (twelve million five hundred thousand United States Dollars).' about this money this guy's 'kin' was supposed to get. I mean umm ...ERM? Wow, it's a conspiracy! Well, I guess it brightens up my spam box! Then, wait, there's more 'In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and it will  eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.' BIGGER EH? I'm only 14! I'm not allowed to be in conspiracys! Wow, wonder if I get a CIA file on me! (:P) 'I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On a smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 20% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses such as telephone bills that may arise during the time of transfer and  while the remaining  75% will be for me and my partners.' ERMMM! Sounds dodgey huh? I'M 14! Yeah, and sooo many people have notyetcracked@hotmail.com as their e-mail addy, so it's easy to see why they sent it to me... NOT! I mean, who would rightly send that type of e-mail to notyetcracked@hotmail.com in the first place? notyetcracked and they still don't get that I'm an imature teenager! 'Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after  concluding this deal with you' 'either in your country or any country you may advise us to invest in.' Way to go guys, you finally found a way to freak me out! Oh, I sent them a reply saying 'Erm... I'm 14.' Great huh? Yeah, go meeee!

Hmm, I was thinking about taking a teenie weenie little break from FY cause you can have too much of a good thing! (Yeah right!) Any way I'm gonna go watch tv, peace guys.

      Woohooo! Anime's on tonight on the sci-fi channel... well, it's on every night! They're showing Rayearth, the original manga of that Magical Knight Rayearth was done by CLAMP so it should be good! But it's on at 00:05! What are they trying to do to us?! Grrr... stupid Sci Fi channel! But hey, at least they're actually showing anime, it's almost extinct apart from that over in England. Oh yeah, tacky stuff like Hamtaro and Pokecrap are still around though... but I'ld be much happier if they became extinct! Hehe... I figure if I stay up till 23:00 then I can get most of the anime recorded... well you've gotta give me points for trying! I might as well just stick the recorder on when I go to bed and leave it to record 3 hrs. Damn that! Why can't it be 6? Eurrrgh... sick coming up, yeah that's why I'm at home. I feel really sick, can't stop coughing and have a heavy head... reeeally bad cold!

      I HATE BOYS VS. I HATE GIRLS (HiLaRiOuS)     BOYS    A heart is not a playing thing, A heart is not a toy, but if you want it  broken, Just give it to a boy. Boys,they like to play with things To see  what makes them run, But when it comes to kissing, They do it just for  fun. Boys never give their hearts away They play us girls for fools,  They wait until we give our hearts And then they play it c ool. You will  wonder where he is at night, You will wonder if he is true, One moment  you will be happy, One moment you will be blue. If you get the chance to  see him Your heart begins to dance, Your life revolves around him,  There's nothing like r o m a n c e. And then it starts to happen, You  worry day and night, You see my friend, you're losing him It never turns  out right. Boys are great though immature, The $price$ you $pay$ is  $high$, He may seem sweet and gorgeous, But remember he is just a guy.  Don't fall in love with just a boy That's takes a lot of nerve. You see  my friend,you need a man To get what you deserve. So when you think that  you're in love, Be careful if you can Before you give your heart away  Make sure that he's a man.      GIRLS    There are many good things in life, Like cars,$money$,and weed. But if  you want something c o n f u s i n g, A girl is all you need. A girl  doesn't say what she wants, But you're somehow supposed to know, If they  want to do this or do that, Stay here,stay there,or just go. Then  there's the time,you all know what I mean, That monthly little j o y,  That lets them a b u s the shit out of you, just for being a boy. If  you ever dare to look at another girl, They seem to scream,go on,and  panic. But watch how fast they ignore you, at the sight of that queer  from "Titanic". They give you questions like, "Am I fat?", And "If you  could go with one of my friends,who?", There is no answer, face the  facts, You are definitely through. They take nothing and blow it up, And  make a tremendous fuss, So girls no matter what you think, You are just >>  as hard to u n d e r s t a n d as us.   Sorry, some thing that I got off of a chain mail and thought was kind of cool. Understand boys? I just kick them in the groin, pour kerosene on them and set alight to them. Who needs to understand them when you can do that instead?

You know? Yeah, I think I should shut up too! Any hoo I'm gonna kick this a bit more and check it out until I'm happy that it's working *KICK KICK THUNK* Thunk? Ahh, I hit it! OWCHIE!

(Why else do you think I got such a high score?) *bats eyelids* That gives me a good idea... here Ian Ian Ian... MUAHHAHA!! We'll teach him for dumping Emma after a day!

Hehe... think I scared him away. It's always the little green men that muck up my web page! *sigh* Any way, know that I can actually blog and not just be met with a pink screen I better blog! I didn't go to Emma's party yesterday, I was waaay too sick and tired. I'ld probably turn up and go straight to sleep! But I'm meeting every one at the park... err... which park? Ahh well, I'll just go to any one! Whoopsie! Some one commented on this but seeing as we're all wearing blinkers no one noticed! Hmm... saneasakitten takes ages to load! And apparantly it's got an error on it... any one wanna help me iron? Ohhh sorry pete person who commented *go annoy him here:  urlLink http://www.petejakehall.com/  Wait a sec... lemme hold on to this feeling... wow... some one commented... ahhhh. Ok, so any way about the Lifehouse lyrics. What is real is just a dream. I think those lyrics are good! They actually make people think. Like a John Mayor song saying erm... wait a sec lemme go validate... hmm can't find the lyrics in my head or the song! Damn! Ahh well... I'll just listen to John Mayor then... ahhh....

Then afterwards I pigged out a bit in the tutor rep meeting. None of the girls were eating! :O I mean helooo! Free doughnuts and chocolate! YEAY! So I showed them how non-anorexic I want to be by eating every thing I was offered. Yep, I sure did, none of the other girls took any thing but  a few boys did. Woohoo! Go piggy little me! Mmm... good aye? Let's start an anti-anorexic piggy campaign! Actually... I have already! Better go play dumb games! Adios!

There's a whole list... he vomits, they vomit, we vomit. We vomit? When would you ever want to, or need to say that? Ahh well, that's foreign language learning for you. Full of weird stuff. Like French. I mean, like we're gonna go to France and talk to people about 'Our Ideal Town' geez, that's just plain madness! Ahh, I have chocolate and tv waiting for me downstairs, and blogging with no one to blog to and no one else blogging gets boring after a time. Ahh well... I keep doing it any way!

That's what music is to me: good melody with actual lyrics. With some songs I didn't listen to the lyrics and now I do and I'm like 'geez dodgey!' or 'err freaky'. Some music has really good lyrics that make you think and wonder... wow. And other stuff has ...crap. (Is it me or are you saying the same thing different ways?) Yep!

      Oh sorry about not blogging for ages, just I was reading Fushigi Yuugi 3 yesterday! It's sooo depressing! Aww! Well.. not that much but it's pretty sad! I don't know how, but I wanna know how Yu Watase keeps coming up with these great story lines! The story never slows down and you always wonder what's going to happen. Geez, when the characters get a break another thing happens! There's only one thing for it... I WANT BOOK 4!!!! *throws a strop* Please!!! Naah, I'll get it when I get some actual money... some day in the distant future. Yeah right! Actual money! These books are like £11.99 a book! Eeek! So by the end (if I ever get to the end of the story) I'll of spent about £71.94 on Fushigi Yuugi! :O Aarghsiee! (And yes, I did use a calculator to work that out) Oh, all my family are having a car boot sale at the market to raise money for Rik cause apparantly he's now going to Peru! I woke up too late so I couldn't go, I've also got home work to do! :( Meanie teachers! Wait a minute! There's now 7 Fushigi Yuugi books! They put one on amazon.co.uk without me noticing and no one told me!!! Oooh, it hasn't been published on amazon.com (geez obsessed much?) either! Wow, we're actually getting new manga at the same time they get it in America! :O That never happens! Wow, some one up their likes me! Just like when we went to Forbidden Planet and they hadn't cleared out the Manga bit (the bit around it had gone!) Nooo! So long as they don't take out the Manga I'll be able to breathe! Hmm... I better post this then post an actual blog! (EH?) Oogsie!

      Yeay! In deep! Mmm... but yeah, any way Sadaam Hussein is a bad man but who are we to judge? He is definatly not the most terrible man, let's not go into that whole evil thing. But it any one actually evil? (Oh well) I don't think so. Guess I'm young and niave, but I don't think any one can be pure evil or pure good, every one has a reason for some thing. If you have no reason then why think that? You have to have a reason to think that. (EH?) Ahh well, every one jump into the psychological magical mystery tour! (Hippy clothes required) Hehe, maybe another day cause I'm tired at the moment but... comments any one? We need to get a deep psychological person to say some thing about the whole Iraq thing. I think every one needs it. Hey! Stop looking at me! :P (Yeah, right) Gotta go watch an Arnie film guys! (Wow, totally ruined that whole mature look) Yurpsie! Bisi!

      soooooooo we are all going deep are we?  Well here are my views;  I think that Sadam Hussane may or most probably is a terrible man, but we have only been shown what the government and the press want us to know.  ( Sorry been paying 2 much attention in media studies)  So that when push come to shove and good old Tone' asks the country whether we should go forth with America everyone will all say yes, because of the impression of Iraq and its reigime that has been given to them by the press.  But know one actually bothers to look deeper than the news.  I reckon all most all the people that make all the important decisions have never been to Iraq to experience what living is like over there, how poor most people are, so mayby, just mayby people should think about them aswell before they rush into anything. I'm now making myself depressed and questioning wierd things so I'm going to go now.

(its a conspiracy i tell you) im really tired which means tommorrow im gonna be hyper. (dont ask me how that works i have no idea what im talking about) anyway im going weird again so ill see you tommorrow.

      wow that was very deep. to be honest im a bit confused about this whole thing. i know that its about like because he would'nt let the weapons people in. all the other countries have handed over all their chemical and nuclear stuff. and i know what you mean about the whole 14 year old stuff it's incredibly ageist. it's like 'your young nothing you say matters'

      Any how! Rant Rant Rant Rant. Well, it might as well be that! Does any one actually read these? Hehe... shouldn't ask... don't wanna know. Ahh, can't be bothered. Let's all listen to a 14 year old's views on the 'soon to be war against Iraq' (hopefully not) who? Me! Yeah, like any one listens to 14 year olds! I can actually get away with talking to people but as soon as I say I'm 14 they treat me as inferior and a little kid. Damn them! (Calm down) Any way... War. What does that mean for you? It means death - propaganda - mourning - tributes - casualties - innocent civilians - conflict to me. Hmm... I don't really know if I'm for it or against it. Apparantly Iraq has a load of nuclear weapons and Saddam Hussein *whatever* is a dictator and gassed people. But I don't really know. Also he's a dictator which is bad which ever way you put it. You can't put a flower boarder around dicator or doodle smiley faces on it. The faces would have to be those showing no emotions, but eyes showing pain. I know Saddam Hussein is bad, but, can we really just march in and kick him out? Is that collenlisation? *whatever* I don't think we can knock out the government *any type of government, dictator what ever, once it's gone the frames of the country will crumble and the country will fall into dissaray *double whatever** We need backing, or at least some Iraq's to agree to help, or take over the country. But then, is it right to hand over the control of a country to some one? just a person, who could turn into the nect dictator and not generally give a damn? At least in Afghanistan the rebels were their, with some stability to take over after the Taliban went. At one point though, the Taliban were the good guys, they kicked out the Russians, then power must of got to their head, plus the fact that the world didn't care and they could do what the damn well liked. How can you ensure that, that doesn't happen in Iraq? I watched this programme, and it was saying about how George Bush was not so dumb with words when he was passionate - talking about revenge or some thing along those lines. When will he stop? At the moment he seems to be fuelled into labelling people as 'terrorists', is this not dangerous to let one man decide who is good and who is bad? After all, he supports the Israelies *whatever* and they are odviously terrorising the Palistinians *kick me if I'm getting this wrong, I'm having a memory lapse and I had to ask my brother to get the names right!* and is not George Bush's whole system against terrorists not for them? That is plain, blatent terrorising what the Israelies are doing and people are dying for, their are no arguments over terrorism their so why is the mighty George Bush not pouncing ont them and promising them to be good? He's in it for the money, that's why. Palestinians die at the hands of American made weapons. Does George Bush care? No. The money's still flowing in. Maybe if Iraq were to start buying up the whole pretzle *whatever* market in America then George Bush would bat an eye lid on this whole thing. This is not an easy situation with an easy way out. It's life.  Okay! Rant over! Sorry guys, I turned into a steam roller then and couldn't stop! Geez, well... give me points for being passionate! :D Better go ...do some thing. Bubi!

      LOL LOL LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That is the subject of todays blog.  (Sorry decided to do some essay practising on blogger!!) I think that Katie Sims has only convinced herself that she makes no sense because there is no evidence that it has been said or the idea even put forward by anyone else.   Also the idea that she is stressed could have just be brought around by her imagination, as a way to explain how she is feeling right now.  (GRRRRRRR I sound like an agony aunt, back to essay!)  Mayby Katie should consider aromotherepy or hitting Izzy as a way to let her stress and anger out.  It is my opinion that two, no actually three of the best ways to combat stress and anger are; 1)Do some house cleaning, imagine that the surfaces are the cause of your problems and work away at them untill they sparkle. 2)Go for a run/jog/walk, and let your legs feel as though the weight is sliding of of them and that your stress and anger is coming away as your legs get lighter. or 3)Punch the lights out of the person that is at the source of your anger and stress.  I hope that this has helped you and that you enjoyed my essay!

      Schizotypal Many believe that schizotypal personality disorder represents mild schizophrenia. The disorder is characterized by odd forms of thinking and perceiving, and individuals with this disorder often seek isolation from others. They sometimes believe to have extra sensory ability or that unrelated events relate to them in some important way. They generally engage in eccentric behavior and have difficulty concentrating for long periods of time. Their speech is often over elaborate and difficult to follow.  Apparantly, according to an online test I have a high chance of having this... cool huh?!  urlLink http://www.4degreez.com/misc/personality_disorder_test.mv  Find out how many millions of dollars it will take to cure you.

I am tired of having to say the right thing, Without offending anyome, And making everyone laugh or think.  I am tired of this life I'm in, This short race to the end, Balancing life on the point of a pin.  I am tired, So let me rest, And then I shall continue with this waltz with death.

Not expecting to hear from Katie until wednesday, she'll be reading that book over and over * - envy - envy - * ....    So I'm weird...what's new? My brothers turning cool!

      Yeay! Bloggers back! *hugs my page* What would I do without you? (Probably end up writing trashy books) Hey! *sniff sniff* Don't leave me like that again! You hear me! (You're talking to a webpage...) MY webpage! Any way... oops, our webpage! *just plugged in* Any way! School's out! Yeay!  urlLink http://www.anorak.co.uk/news_161245.shtml  It's funny! The dumb stuff that newspapers come up with... Any way, back to small point that's probably floating around here some where... hmm... oh here it is. I went on  urlLink ebay  and err... how to put it. Went a bit FY obsessed! Some of the stuff is really cheap! *eerie silence* Come on guys! FY!!! (Fushigi Yuugi for all you uneducated non-manga lovers) Oh... I was trying to do CCS again. Aargh how hard is that! I mean, they could at least give you some hint as to what these tags do! How do I get the text to the right of the picture? I don't have any idea! I'll probably end up chopping it up again... *zzz* Fun... nope. I try to find out how to do it, but every one's grumpy and like 'Well no one helped me learn it so bugger you' to put it basically. Nice huh? But then if no one helps any one it'll just keep going around in a messy circle! Woohoo! Blood! Guts! YEAH! *ahem* Any way... the point? Here pointy pointy point. Oh yeah, I'll just throw some thing together and make every one go 'wow, and it took you that long to just do  that? ' And I'll go off going 'rasumfrasum' like I do. OK! Hey! I'm not depresssed! Just deep! Ok... so depresssed has three s's *how do you do that?* now! Yeah! I'll go back to my hole now... first I'll turn off the bathroom light, every one leaves it on for a weird reason...

Yeah, different, but not in a bad way! Aww... depressing music I'm listening to. *sniff sniff* I'll be ok! Wasn't that cool in English? Our teacher Mr Nutbrown is soo cool! He's totally phylisophical! Which is cool cause it gets us all going 'hmm' which is good! In a way... it gives a point to my babblings! When is punishment acceptable? Interesting point huh? Well, not the way I put it! Should we be allowed to hit out children? I don't think so. Doesn't that teach them that the only way to deal with some thing is by voilence or force, and doesn't it not teach them how to reason with people? My parents have never hit us, so my brother's now really good at reasoning and he can get my mum to do almost any thing for him! So it's gotta be good! More pocket money! Yeah! I'll go crawl away... I'm getting excited about nothing again! Well yeah, that's what I do. I'll come annoy you later, don't worry. Oh, I'll learn to spell in a few years though so you're still safe.

It's eight pages in font size 11 at the moment and I haven't even finished it! Eeeek! I need to know how long every one elses are because I think mine's gonna be too long. Oh, yeah and the title... hmm... The Lost White Tulip? The Threads of White Tulips? Hmm... yeah, if you haven't guessed it's got some thing to do with white tulips, so it would be good to have them in the title. Oooh, Chao, the guy in Manu Chao is French! Wow! Cool guy, he travels the globe writing his songs! I want his job!!! Mind you... could be hard to drag a piano around the desert and places... Yeah...  urlLink http://www.whspliff.net/  I guess they're proud to sell canabis!

      Hmm... has any one read 1984? I think it's called that... it's a really good book but it kind of freaks you out. As my brother put it, 'You never think the same again.' and that's true. You get really freaked! Basically, the scary point about it is that this guy hates the strict dictatorship he's under and wants to break out of it. So he's thinking about breaking out of it and going to do some thing about it, but he can't because of the 'Thought Police' who are supposed to pick out trouble makers and get rid of people trying to go against the dictatorship. So he starts a diary, which is prohibited, and he thinks he's got past the Thought Police... but he hasn't. Aww, the ending's sad. Big Brother is watching you. ...(Don't question the pointlessness of this!)

      Ok- I've been checking out work experience, here's my progress so far -   I tried the Big Issue Offices in Bristol and they told me to phone back when the boss guy was in, which I didn't because my mum told me that it was located in this dodgey place in Bristol which is the centre of a prostitution ring!! And passing cars will try to pick up anyone of female gender. My mum knows because she used to have to walk through there to get to work and she basically said - "NO WAY!!!"   So I was looking through schools, and I found this french school, which I thought would be some twee little after-school classes for kids who want to learn how to say "My name is Freddie" and such, In French. So I left a breif answer-phone message and got a bit freaked out when the voice on the machine was French... *takes deep breath*   So I visited the website and realised to my horror that it was a school for French/English kids - a PRIVATE school, £901 for 5 days!!!! Its for kids with one French parent and one English parent who want their kid to be bi-lingual. These 5 year-olds can probably speak French better than I can!   SO (argh, how many "So"s?) I was looking through the list of magazines and newspapers in the yellow pages, and I found something called the Spark Positive Change Magazine - groovy, huh? I visited the website and it's run by about 10 members of staff in a one-room office! Woohoo! And basically they sound like a load of hippies from the 70's who want to change the world...so, naturally, I emailed them! Arghh... I hope the French lady doesnt phone!  Speaking of French - Arghhh! We have to go see Mr.S tomorrow! It was all my mum, NOT me, ok???

      Heysie. Gromit's the dog and Wallace is the weird ear guy. Geez what is it with his ears? Yeah it rained sooo bad today! I was walking home - across Golden Valley School field and I could barely walk because of the wind and because of that all the rain was getting swept up into my face and it hurt! I couldn't see cause I had to blink all the time and my eyes stung! Owchie! Oh, I broke my umbrella! I couldn't open the stick thing *nod* so I tried to jam it in. Then, the next time I opened it the top came off! It just all broke off! So I put it in the bin and tried to survive without it! Oh, I was a wimp going to school though and I got a lift! Hehe, that was like minimal ran compared to this evenings tsunami! Sorry I'm boring... it's just I had french and boring stuff today, oh and french homework *shivers* Euugh... bad bad bad!

      Excuse me Lynne! How dodgey! There are little kids here... erm... yeah! *grabs a little kid* see! Oops, sorry Izzy. :) Hehe I love being evil! Any hoo today was absolute hell! First we had science and I hadn't done the homework! So I had to copy it off of Izzy, but then it figured that we didn't have to hand it in! Aaarghsie! Then we had CROSS COUNTRY! Noooo! Which was hell by the way. We had to run around our school, oh yeah *run*, then out and to another school which we ran around, then back and around our field. It . was . so . much . fun. :| Not really. The only preperation we had for this was going around our school - once. So seeing as we such at fitness at the moment it was dead scary! Then apparantly we cut corners and didn't do it right so we have to do it again! AARGH! To our PE teachers - Piss off, not likely! My knee kills now and I remucked up my wrist. :( So basically, I'm not a happy bunny and I can't hop far. But at least I didn't bring the school down when I cooked macoroni *whatever* cheese *bigger whatever* Ugh, me tired!

      Wahay, good poemy thingy aye? Just me being angry again :D Ooh yeah, I get angry a lot! But my happy bubble keeps going some how... so I'm happily angry! I don't mind when people try to break my bubble because no one can apart from me. When I become sad it breaks, and no other time. What really gets me angry is if some one tries to break some one elses bubble, because some people's aren't made with as strong bubble mix as mine and some are made with stronger. So if you lend some one your bubble mix when they need it maybe they'll lend you their's when you need it. Mmm... I'm just full of bubbly logic!

And then we watched Evil Woman which was err... dodgey and umm freaky! But it had the guy out of Tenacious D in it! :O Then we started a pillow fight! Oh, Emma went to get a ball out back and got hurt so I had to leg it with no shoes on to the alley at the back of my house with a first aid kit! Hehehoo! Geez I'm weird! And freezing cold at the moment... I'm starting to think that big flares with stringy top isn't good. Cooold hands. Yeah, well... this is random... I'll go clean my teeth, bubi!

(Seriously needing a life) No, not really. Just a whole load of pain relievers at the moment. The computer's getting to me and I've got a bad headache. :( (...) What!

That could so have been phrased better I'm guessing...  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/021130/140/dfrih.html  Oh my god that's scary! Geez... imagine finding out that you've got HIV or some thing. Damn scary. Oh, sorry about the randomness. It's just that admazingly I can do a lot of things at once so I surf while I blog. (Not just multi heads, multi computers too!) Yeah... I see how that works but... no. Heheee. I was just looking at foxkids... as you do. And Iron Man's on it! Yeahhh! Some one's bringing ye olde cartoons back from the warehouse! YEAY!

      Whoops should of realised that! Any way, stupid thing of the day. A 19 year old man was catapulted off a... human catapult and he missed the safety net, went squash and died! What a cool death! You'ld be like 'ccooooool' then you'ld see the ground and be like 'ahhh fucccckkkk!' or some thing along those lines! Ehe... greeeat. Oh, I did another dumb thing. People keep calling and not saying any thing, and I was kind of hyper... *i'm always hyper* So I said 'Hello? Hello? Goodbye.' then I cancelled it! WHOOPS! Then I dialed 1471 and before it dialed it this guy said 'hello?' AARGH! Damn I'm a prat!

Nothing's perfect. Geez, I've gotta stop doing this. Doing deep, short sentances. Maybe it can get into your head easier in small short snippets. (That wasn't short) Oh well.

      I am totaly agreeing Katie!  All some people think about now adays is them selves!  They don't think about what their actions mite do to other people.  They have been brought up in a world where they have always had what they want and when they got it.  To make it simple for blonde peeps (see even im racist about myself) if i was doing what George Bush is doing to the Muslim culture at school this is what it might be like;  Katie beats Lynne up because she ahs pink socks (random thing i no) Lynne thinks that this is awful and in return gets all her allies to help her kick the stuffing out of Katies class, because of what one person out of 30 thinks is right!  See people need to be tought to become tollerant of other peoples beliefs and what they do.  If we went round bombing everyone that we haad the weeniest fall out with there would be noone left to bomb!!  Its simple.  Basicly America and England are starting to have a dictated leadership.  There are not enough  conservatives or Lib dems in the house of commons to have a fair argument against the labour Mps, so what labour says goes! Rant over.  I feel really ill.  I am still doing Media studies c/w and have been since 1/2 9 so i thought i needed a brake!!  (Suprisingly) I really cant think of anything else to say, so its back to my c/w!!!

      Has any one heard about this BNP thing? They've taken seats. The racist party has gained, how did this happen? Are people in Britain really that narrow minded? These asylum seekers are here and it's our duty to protect them. They've taken asylum in our country. Do you really think that they want to come out of one country where they wil probably be killed and go to a country where they are condemned for the colour of their skin or their atributes? Is this fair? Imagine going to Africa and being picked on because 'you were white' surely you wouldn't stand for that, so why should all the 'black' *i hate using that word, sorry* people take the crap they get from us? After Osama Bin Laden attacked America people began to attack muslims. Why? Because they were the same religion. Because they could be in the same sect or whatever as him. What bull shit. Maybe we should have been killed when Hitler began his reign of terror because we came from the same descendents and most of us had blonde hair and blue eyes. Maybe because of the way we looked we could have been a Nazi. What racist crap is going around these days? Why hasn't educating reached out to these people, and beaten them to a bloody pulp until they understood?

      Err yeah! We soo get what Lynne's going on about! Any way, on to more serious matters *like cheese?* No, not like cheese.  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/021123/140/dfbb5.html  - It's this Miss World thing. It's sparked violence and killed more than 100 people. Why? All because of some brainless bimbos pouncing around a stage? Not really, all because of the prejudice that still exists in this world. Some one published an article in a national newspaper saying that  Muhammad would have wanted to marry one of the beauty queens. I think I blame this person for the violence that errupted afterwards. What were they thinking? So odviously, this person is Christian. Maybe we should change 'Muhammad' to 'Jesus'. This person odviously has no respect and is a racist chauvanist *there's me trying to be clever again*. With people like that in Nigera then it's understandable that this violence has started. Seperate groups should not be seperated further, they should be put together and made to understand each other, it's too easy to say that it's all the other groups fault, and not understand why they're doing it. With understanding comes knowledge, I just hope some people learn this before it's too late. Maybe George Bush should go back to school, I think he needs it. He see's these 'terrorists' as completely unhuman and as animals that will kill us all, but surely they're still human beings. What is this world coming to?

Yeay! Hmm cryptic poem aye? I'm still trying to figure out what it means. Poems just come to me, they aren't planned, I just write them. Fun! Wow, I can make millions by doing basically nothing!

Don't worry if you're lost right now, it'll only take you a few years to learn!

      HEEEY! I'm sooo HAPPY! I won my e-bay thingy! YEAY! But er it was really tight! I bet like 1p more than this person who bet for it ages ago. Ahh heck, their loss I guess! OHH! I'm also happy happy cause I have the 5th Fushigi Yuugi book! And some cool Ban Dai Sailor Moon thingies! (Ahh yes, love tacky Ban Dai!) I'm just SOOO happy! Uhoh, I'll go all depressed in a minute, oh nooo school and I haven't done any homework! I woke up in the middle of the night going 'must do home work, school tomorrow - ugh' so I started doing homework but then I figured that we don't have school today so I was like NOOO! And I couldn't get to sleep for ageees! It was stupid. When I woke up I felt like lead, and then I realised that I had started doing the maths any way so maybe it was better than it didn't have to be in by today! I even started making up excuses and planning to copy people! You know what they say - once devious, always devious *they also say: when you can't spell, you can't spell* Grr! Any way me go chop carrots bubi!

      HELLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO or Ping Pong as I now prefer!  I had fun last night, but i can't type @ the mo so ill try and make this short and sweet!!  The fireworks were really good, we stood at the end of Annas road and watched them.  It was sooo funny we saw her nxt Door neighbours leaving and they started talking ot us.  I was slightly hiper and started to pretend to b Irish and they were staying dead serious and i was trying to keep this convo going with me talking in an Irish accent!!  The main problem is all that i can say covincingly is Hello there Father and can I have a cuppa T!!  It was very funny!  Then we watched Popstars and i thought that Mat  (the cute 1 thats gurt lush) was going 2 b kicked out and Anna i nearly started 2 cry which is really pathetic!!  But ot was funny @ the time.  Then I woke up @ about 1/2 4 this morning 2 find that Jenny had squished me up against Annas bed and I couldn't move!  I proptly woke her up and got her 2 move and then fell back 2 sleep!   Then I was on perade at 10:30am lukin brilliant!!   Toodles xx

They (cadets) have turned round to us and have said that we have 2 wear Bun nets (which i did already) and that we have 2 wear a hair tie that matches our hair colour.  I mean where am i meant 2 get a hair band with blonde, dark brown, and a reddy brown colours on it? This morning I decided to make a cake.  the first one that i have made in our new oven, I used to make Minty cakes in the old oven, but in this one they don't cook properly, and theydont rise they go down!!!  I am not happy with it.  So i watched Telly for a while to make myself feel better, but it diddn't really work so I am telling my feelings to you insted, mayby thats not such a good idea because you will laugh at them.

Mmm... I had a craving for twiglets in history, not that's weird seeing as I kind of don't like twiglets that much. Any way help SMEE! My parents want me to make another cake and they're making me cut out aprons! AAARGH! (Hey, don't complain, you're getting paid to cut out aprons) ... Oh yeah so I am. Ah heck, now I have nothing to complain about. Oh, apart from Lynne told the person who was gonna ask out Anna that she doesn't want to go out with him seeing as he kept arranging it and then never turning up. (Who wants it arranged any way? People just either get embarrassed or obsessed. I mean helooo, not good!) *silence* Ahh heck, don't say heloo back, you might excite it. (It?) You. The thing that happens to be by my head. (Oh. Your other head?) Yup. Brown to the roots guys! I better go ...find some thing to do. Bubisi.

Go have fun  urlLink http://beaulieu.free.fr/japon/vocabulaire.html  And then be green with envy that they can read English and all we can say in French is "Donne-moi l'argant sinon tu vas regretter" Or some thing like that!

      Owchie! My arm hurts when I stretch it! It's because I was kind of throwing myself at a rope and clinging on to it... it's called PE. Yeah, but hell, it was fun. No pain no gain! Err... whatever that's supposed to mean. I did get a bit freaked out at one point, where I was swinging on the rope, with my feet resting on the knot and all of a sudden I had convinsed myslef that there was no way to get down apart from falling flat on my ass. Which, although highly amusing for *others* (IZZY) would have hurt a hell of a lot. Trust me, I know from ice-skating... not that I fell on my butt a lot... Ahh, that's the one time when I envied Laura and her big butt. (Why do my blogs always flot about in the sea of randomness?) Any way, onto less ...serious things? Yeah, guess so. In English - onto my dumb writing, I think every one's noticed how weirdly I write, some times serious and the next minute just plain loopy! Funnn! (Yes, fun has three n's!)

      Well boo!  I have had a fun two days.  Yesterday ( that was Monday for those forgetful people out there) Laura H and I went into Bristol to go to the museum.  It was sooooo boring.  It rained all day so I didn't feel like shopping on Park Street :( and then we go and get lost on some hill in the pouring rain.  FUN!! Then when we finally got to the city centre we had to stand in a shop doorway to eat our lunch, and then got the next bus home!  Today on the otherhand was more exciting, I met up with Anna and we did what we do best; SHOP!! I got a LUSH bag its little and black with really cute stitching on it, I really am so happy I bought it.  Well I hope that you have all had a really exciting year and heres to the next.*raises glass* to a fantastic new year; may it bring you happiness, health and a whole lotta luvin! *Puts glass down* Ok well thats my little thang over and done with.  Will someone please phone me about going out, because if you dont I will cry because I will think that no one likes me.  Also you could all probably come round to mine (HOPEFULLY) Toodles xx

Me and Izzy welcome the millennieumemememe *yaargh* I'll be back in a sec...Millennium with "Yaaargh nooo dududumdumdum." Cool huh. So, in 50 years when the worlds ended and we're all bits of floating anti-matter *does anti-matter float? does any one care?* I can say that I did that... yeah... Well I told you it was a small point! *why do I bother* Apparantly, according to Izzy I'm the 'random generator' so I guess I'm just living up to whatever it is I'm supposed to be living up to. *yes, i'm truely this weird most of the time*

      One day in a land far away, in a place called Etheopia. (Crap, gotta check spelling now.) Ethiopia even... the workers worked away for the evil Nestle. (Heheee) Suddenly they decided that they wanted fairness and decided to become communist, err I don't know the rest... erm... after a bit they stopped ...? Nestle was plotting though, and decided that as they had lost money the poor Ethiopians who were about to go into famin and had no money any way had to pay them a ridiculous amount of money just because evil Nestle thought they had lost money when the Ethiopians were communist. Suddenly every one realised that Nestle were infact big poos and should go down, and so they were boycotted across the land and every one lived happily ever after...  *Oh and I got to rule the world, forgot to add that minor detail. :)

      Geez serious lack of blogs aye? Great huh, we get a holiday and don't blog. Nothing interesting to blog about I guess. (The point being...) Erm yeah... none really... Ehe... Every one have a good Christmas? I got every thing I wanted! Yeay! I hope you did. I went to see my relatives on Boxing Day and it reminded me that Christmas is also about being with people, spreading joy and all that stuff. I felt really content. I haven't felt like that for ages. Any way, my cousins were there and I haven't seen them for years! One of them works in Houston and has a girlfriend in New York he sees at the weekends! (Geez, that's like some one in England having a partnare *how the hell do you spell that?* in Moscow! partnaire? uhh companion? Yeah that's better. Never mind. I'm getting back to writing again! Yeay! I used to write a load of stuff when I was younger and I've kind of stopped, hey I got A* from my teacher for my GCSE story! (Hehe, guess that tenner worked... hehe) Mmm I'm boring. YEAY!

      So it's still me and a blank page.  Wherever you people are; thanks for abandoning me like this.  I thought Christmas was a time 4 family and umm what are they called oh yeah FRIENDS!! *cough cough* (sorry Kes 4 stealing it just felt it was appropraite)  So I have been inside all day.  My mum and sis have colds, I have nothing to do, and its only the first day of the holidays, o joyus rapture.  Umm i think i may be ill, as the page seems to be moving and blurring a bit.  I better have a lie down.  Blow that its gone back to normal now.  Ummmm i have rainbow coloured nails, it looks mighty fine if i do say so myself.  Ok then i think i will be going now.  I may not get back on the computer untill after christmas day so; Have a fantastic day and dont a) eat 2 much b) drink 2 much or c) get up after 7:30am!!! Toodles xx

      Ok well... we have not been writting alot on blogger this week have we??  I am really not tired STILL!!!  Does anyone know if milkways can be made in Kingsize, or am i just being as dence as a dimond at the moment?? i keep thinking of you've got mail as i'm typing this because my keyboard makes exactly the same noise when I type as it did when they typed.  Freaky eh?  I feel like typing random stuff becasue i am really bored at the moment, no one is online I have no homework or any work in any shape way or form 2 do and the television thats on 2nite is pants!!  Hey i'll keep smilling.  So my new favourite phrase to ask is;  whats your opinion of chocolate tea pots??  Its a very interesting question.  I mean you mey neva own one but think of the amazment and ore it would bring to your life if you did.  I think that our discussion of world issues last nite really helped us to understand each other better.  I mean i never thought i would see Emma saying that we needed to be quieter!!  I mean i thought Emma was the Queen of noise, o well.  I actually learnt alot of stuff last nite that i sorta knew but it expanded my knowledge on it, if you get my drift.  I think that i had better go now, as i have 2 email several people all about different things!!  O well. Toodles xx

Go me!  urlLink http://www.warprecords.com/news/?offset=60&ti_id=248   urlLink http://offthetelly.users.btopenworld.com/reviews/2002/lookaroundyou.htm   urlLink http://www.observer.co.uk/screen/story/0,6903,805343,00.html   urlLink http://www.shinyshelf.co.uk/article.php?articleid=401&layout=3  Wow!

I had to cause my brother had a massive party! I just got back (It's 3:30) and there were beer cans everywhere! *shock* And a half empty bottle of scottish whisky *so shoot me, I can't spell!* I went shopping after I went to Laura's. Oh, yeah we made Izzy a present! Let's just say that it would match the colour of this web page *hehe* Hey has any one else heard Queens of the Stone Age? I've got them going through my head! (Along with other things) I'm not alone any more! (Whatever that means) Ahh... I gotta go for birthday cake! I'll blog some sense later! Bisibi!

      Ha ha Izzy, I know what the heck they are on about because I have secerst informatives, mainly Kes!!  We went and bought the Christmas tree after school.  We dug one ourself which was very funny because we kept on going round in circles trying to decide which one to get.  Dad was also very generous and last night he bought me a ruler because I think James Green took mine.  :(  I am really quite bored as noone is online, so to give me something to do lets go back in the archives to a year ago.............Ok mayby not as it does not work, if anyone can get it 2 work please give me a bell.  I have just heard the rainbow song: Izzy we have 2 get a copy 4 u know what, and if you dont HELPPPPPPPP!!!!!  I have also just been told off for banging the door.  :( Toodles xx

      Wooooo I havent been on this for ages and guess what - I have short hair! Woohoo! Well i guess its not that short but its about half the length it was before. Wow. Some people were like - "Wow it's great" and others were like "Oh my god what have you DONE?"    Well apparently Sami's been on this and just to see how carefully she's reading it - HI SAMI ... anyway...   I have one last rehersal tomorrow before tuesday and I'm a bit scared, but not as much as Jen seeing as she busted her hand up yesterday and can't actually play! Oh dear.    I'm also a bit scared seeing as Kes and Laurapoos have been talking about how they're going to make my birthday present tonight...I managed to catch something like "they've got to go in the thing..." or something like that but I'm a little confused. It's a bomb isn't it? Or a jackinabox or something where you open the lid and something leaps out and grabs you... or not.

(Err... what a bad typing error!) *LIFT. She gave me a LIFT home! (Ahh better!) So I'm happpyyy! And my piano teacher gave me a present and a card! And I didn't give her any thing! Beginning to feel a bit guilty now... hell yeah. I had some thing supremely funny to say... but... it's gone. Hell! (Hell?) Nm. Well today was freezing! Like minus freezing! But I'm okay now! I'm wearing about five layers!!! Mmm, Izzy you need to phone me about staying at your house, otherwise I might be stuck at my house when my brother's having his party! I'll be stuck in my room with drunk people downstairs! Ahh! I'll probably be afraid to use the loo! Oh that was it! My tv got stuck at 6.45, on the news so it's frozen with this freak guy on saying 'Live 6.45' at the bottom! Weird huh! Better go do... interesting things... that is once I find out what they are...

Guess what! We might not have a christmas tree! And I was oh-so looking forwards to sweeping up the pine needles that come off it! (Scrooge!) Yup, sorry guys. I'm not a very special day person though, my birthday doesn't mean a lot to me, other peoples do though! (Aww, it is scrooge!) Yeah, sorry but I know that we should all be happy happy but we're not! That's just stereotypical, what society expects. God, I sound like a right git, don't I? Don't answer. I've got a mean headache brewing and I've got a feeling that the little green men are gonna be coming out. (If you don't know me then just say WTF and be content) Ahh... I'm better now, out of moody streak. Well, we can't be happy all the time now, can we? That would just be sickening and ...Clueless like *shivers* Euugh... now let us never speak of that name again.

      Mmm... ok, bear *is that right?* with me, I'm listening to Iron Maiden! "Fear of the daaark!" Err yeah. But any way. Have you ever though (nope) how it's admazing *hehe* that you can see some one every day of you life, but say that you don't really care about them. Wow, I really don't make sense. But... you know. In school I see people every day, and will do for a few more years *groan*. But I never have them over, or get to known them better, but surely they must be really important in my life? Is it hard to keep people in your web of friends? And even harder to link up? I dunno, because there is no right answer, life is confusing. It's made to be like that, otherwise we would all become WSL's named Mandy *shivers*. No disrespect to Mandy's but... you must feel like Barbie's with that name! (Btw that was disrespectful) Umm... look! A three headed monkey! *hehe fools*

Sorry Dado Rail, but hey you have to tell me some thing a million times to get through some times (too many times in there?) Yup! *dog mode* Ahh... so... bloody...  COLD  (Yes! I've suddenly discovered the bold tags!)  urlLink http://uk.weather.yahoo.com/UKXX/UKXX0025/index_c.html  Yeah... god! High's of 4oC! Wow... geez arrgh my legs are gonna drop off in a minute! Especially in PE... I mean god, they wouldn't put us outside would they...? Ah, but the only kick in life PE teachers get is watch us running around in the freezing cold! Maybe Ms Broom will carry out her cross country threat... YAAARFG!!!H!! (Erm... more like YAAARGH!) Whoops, sorry, sneezed. (Weird.) Hehe, school was funny. Izzy told us an embarrassing story, and as I ohso love sharing these *muahahaaa* I will! She was mucking round with her friend in orchestra (trust me, you don't want the teeny details) and suddenly (maybe you do, geez this is hard to follow) *suddenly?* they started talking about Monkey Island thingy, and they both do the 'point to a vacant spot and shout look it's a three headed monkey' thing *brain breath* like you do.... or I do.... and then this boy walked into Izzy's vacant spot and went 'EH?' (Or some thing like that) Maybe it was fait (crappy spelling) fate? Err... scratch that. Maybe it was fate, maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was Izzy's bad smell that drove him. (Aren't I just lovely?) Not really I spose. Wow, lets all go heavy metal with Opeth! (Freaky!)

Well yeah so my choice of 'good' music might be out of societies standards but hell I'm weird! Mmm... any way I'm gonna go muck around with the parental advisory thingy. Have fun kiddies. Hey if you're bored and want to listen to scary 70's music, download 5th Dimension - Age of Aquarius and God don't ask why I have that!

I got   MANGA!   (Now what's the tag for bright flashing lights surrounding it again?) Ah well. And some cool tops! Yeay! So, overall I'm a very happy floppy bunny! Ahhha but a funny thing happed! (sigh) We were being all good and hoho like so we decided to buy some presents for this kid (you get given a tag) where they couldn't usually have presents or something... (Hey, do I usually make sense) But we bought two foreign swear words books and we accidently gave them in with the books for the boy! Geez! My mum bets that some one's gonna write into the independent and blabber on! But if any one asks, it wasn't us! Yes... err... my name is Isobel Tarr. Please complain to Isobel Tarr.

Im in a funny mood.  one minute i feel ill and the next i dont.  its rather quite poo!!  I'm not actually sure what im writing, so if comes out as a pile of poo, im very sorry.  Laura am i sharing a Pizza with you @ Bottilinos still, or have u dumped me 4 Izzy?  I hope u have not. I seem to have written the word poo alot in this blog, mayby i should go and see someone about it.  Anyhow, i had better go and have some lunch now other wise dad will get angry with me, because i have been on the net all morning!

Aargh, a week off school can really make you bored, but on the pro side, I do have a tv schedule worked out for if I'm ill again! (Yeay!) Arrrgh damn eyes. And they really haven't been open for that long any way, I'm getting a pretty much 12 hour sleeping thing nower days. Geez I feel awful. I might pass out any minute now! Yeay! Actually, waaay too weak *week weak? AARGH!!!* causse I felt too sick for tea. Awsie, poor me! I'm also going crazy, I can probably mentally play my piano piece perfectly by now! (Don't ask) I'm gonna go watch tv, bubi.

Help meeee! Aahhh what the heck, I'll be back soon enough (god now I know I'm really ill, I  want  to go back to school) I might not be able to go to the Victorian Fayre though (snooy) but even if I do, I can't stay for long otherwise I'll cough all over you and then everyone will have the week over! No matter how fun that could be... *imagines one-ringing izzy all day long* Muhaha.

My head just feels like it's got a ten ton weight attached to it. So I didn't go to school, instead I got a healthy six hours extra in bed! It seems to have gone to my brain though because at the moment I'm finding it hard to type and talk without coughing up ...stuff. (Don't ask) Mmm... *cough cough splurrgh* Err yeah. Well owchie, my throat does kill a lot! Do you ever think that maybe you're ill because some one else is ill? Maybe you're helping some one some where. (Maybe you need a psychiatrist) Well yeah, then there's that. Maybe no one is the missing part of the jick err... wait a sec... puzzle. (I was about to say jick saw) Geez, I really am ill!

      I have been thinking. shock shock horror horror I know but anyway.  With Laura going out with Ben it started the whole of something new into our lives, something that many of us had never experienced before.  Or we may have done but not on a serious level.  What I am talking about is the male species.  When Laura first started dating Ben she changed.  Some may say that this change was for the better, and others for the worst.  We make jokes about it, being a spinster etc. but deep down inside we knew that she had something that we didn't, and we were jealous, even if we didn't think we were.  When Laura dumped Ben we saw another change, she had experienced life with guys, and this time being single didn't mean just making a joke out of it, she wanted to "play the field".  She had got what she had wanted, but now she wanted more.  This may sound like I am being a bit of a switch but I will carry on.  When there were rumers about Dan liking Izzy she used to get cross with people if they asked her what was going on with her and him.  An example of this is when at her party I sed that she would probably hit me if i asked but i was going to ask anyway.  She then hit me and sed that there was nothing going on, and there never would be.  HOW WRONG WAS SHE!!??  She is now activley dating someone.  She has now experienced life with guys aswell, and once her and Dan are finished she will want some more too!   Basically the point I am trying to make is, we are changing, it may be for better or worse, but we have to make use of what we have and not joke about it.  Deep down inside I know I'm jealous, are you?? xx

      I'm not saying that every one's bad, I don't believe in being born bad. I think people make a conscious decision about it. You can bully, or be bullied I guess. It's too easy to stay as you are, if you're horrible then every one will expect you to be horrible, it's quite hard to break that loop. Some people can't be bothered to put the energy in to change. I'm a optomist about that. I think that people can change. What if people can't thought? What is Rosie's destined to be a horrible deceitful bitch for the rest of the life? How will we cope! But seriously... hmm... Ahh I better go do homework, go my children of the night and think about changing, and if you should.

      Let me tell you the story of Dave. He has a attention disorder, which means that he can change moods really quickly and is usually over-reactive. Well, for some reason all the bastards in our year seem to enjoy making his life like hell. Still following? Good. Instead of leaving him alone, because he is easily provoked, they decide to pick on him. Just because he is different they decide to class him as an outsider. Maybe they think it is uncool to like him. I think it is uncool to like them. Who gives a damn about social relations any way? If your friends tell you not to become friends with some one, then are they friends or manipulators? Every one decided to pick on him, not just pick on him but bully him. So he started crying. Dave isn't usualy a person to cry, but he was depressed that day. Where is the good samaritan when you need him? If you actually see some one hurting, don't you stop? No, when you're so intent on hurting some one for no purpose you don't, you are blinded by your peers. So they didn't. Now Dave cuts himself, and wants to die. And all because no one could be bothered to care.  Stories don't always have happy endings.

      Communism. Imagine that we found a leader that could not be corrupted, and your country became communist. Would you agree to this? It would mean that every one had the same amount of things, the same chances and shared every thing. Do you want this? Instead would you have every thing for yourself and nothing for no one else? I think I would prefere every one to have the same chances in life, with the same amount of money than me being greedy and having it all. If we spread out the world's food supply, then there would be more than enough. Instead we consume more than neaded, and throw away food that could feed starving children. Is this right?

      Casualties of War  We started a war to save you all, But ended up killing you instead. There's not much we can do now, Now that you're all dead. Let the days pass, Let the families grieve. The death brings us all to our knees. We're truly sorry that this happened, That you won't live to fight another day. But you are the innocent casualties of war, And that's all we have to say. Maybe you'll be reincarnated, And another war will begin, And all you can do is stand there, And wait for the end of your life.  Katie Sims  This is my Anti-War poem. To the guy that reviewed this saying: "Rather broken rythm adds a feeling of dread to a pretty good piece, one complaint...its truly, not truely. Other than that, I liked it" It is true. Open your eyes and for god sake learn how to spell! It is sooo truly truly! Isn't it guys? I thought it was! *sniff sniff* Okay, I'll cut the crap and go write some more! Woohoo! Haha, but I won't be the one forced to read them! Muhahaaa! Geez, I kind of get the feeling that these blogs are getting more and more pointless, oh well!

And the prize was tic-tacks! And I can't really be bothered! Sorry, but some times being hyper happy is too much effort! Damn I hate that. Ahh, but real big question: Does it take more energy to be happy or sad? It takes quite a lot to mope because you've got to concentrate on being miseable! Fun! Yeah yeah I'm going with my stupid ramblings! Oh and WOW Tag-Board! USE IT! Ehe... did I say that out load again? Damn! Here Laura Laura, come and trample the nice people.

      Dreaming  The lapping of the sea, Against the golden bay. The swirling of the colours, From dark to light to grey.  The calming of your senses, Into a relaxed state. Daydreams of far away places, That make you stir and wake.  The sand in your hair, The wind in your face. This is where I really live, In my protective case.  Completely left alone, To do what I wish. Who knows what I could achieve, Living in this state of bliss.  Kes  WOW! It kind of works! Has any one else noticed that black to white has to go through grey? Ahh, clever thought provoking point aye? (Err... no)

Turns out he was going out with some one when he was gonna ask Izzy out and he liked Izzy when he was going out with Debbie. *As my mum would put it, relationships are the hardest things.* Or are they? I guess they are? Dan's just too... flirty? I seriously think he might be gay when he's older! *According to other sources as well* Mmm... tea... sauces.  You think you can have it all, You would take it any way. But you can't have me, You never will.  THIRD EYE BLIND! Ahhhh! Sorry, hyper phase! HeheheehoooHOOO! Nevermind... any way seeing as I'm hyper I can type quickly! Yeay! Dan's such a player though, but he doesn't like me and Laura one bit! He totally doesn't talk to us! But hey, we're spinsters! (Proven fact ya know) Ahh yes FF10... I seriously should actually play that. I kind of got to the end without getting to extra Aeons, and I missed out all the cool chocobo stuff! *sniff sniff* Life's harsh when you're a kid. Dreaming's my escape. Sorry about the randomness *again* just trying to bring a bit of confusion into your already confused lifes. I think when you saw the 'just to keep me sane' you already switched off. Oh geez, now William Tell? What is up with our playlist! Sorry, my *brothers* play list! We've got Barry White, Motzart, Manu Chao and Opeth! How ...random! Maybe I should change my name on this to 'random'. Oh Lynne, some one got on this by searching for you're name! BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID! (I am!) I'll just go back to hiding in the hole! I might not be on again tonight cause my brother wants a loooong go but otherwise see youuusie latersie.

      Ahhh hehe, funny thing happened! This girl in our school Lynne heard in the loo *just nod* talking to her friends about how she had a square butt! *okay, they weren't in the loo, lynne was they were outside doing... whatever they do i dunno! brushing their hair?!* Phew, dug myself out of that one! Kind of... Then in Tech when she walked away all her 'friends' were saying "No don't worry, it looks rectangular to me!" Geez that's sad, who cares! Why do people have to be so preened up that they care about their butt? Isn't their more to life than looking like a Barbie doll? (Apart from acting like one? :P) Mind you, this girl is a bitch. Why is it that some girls I know *so people won't be offended* get a tiny inkling that they look 'nice', so they go and tart themselves up and start being bitchy? What is this, some kind of fashion? POWER TO INDIVIDUALS!!!! Yeayyyy! I seriously think I would be murdered alive in a American high school!

      Ahh yet another day of clearing out my blasted so called 'e-mail account'. And woohoo, it's all junk mail. Actually... some of it might not have been but I deleted it any way, sorry guys! If any one actually sends me some thing, and I don't know and the subjects weird I usually delete it. Put some thing like 'hey don't delete this it's interesting' and I might actually read it. I got a weird one about a screen saver but hell, my computer's all virused up already and has no more room for more. Ahh gotta go watch Lord of the Rings. Sorry for the ...weirdness but remember, we only live once.

      People don't get forced to grow up, they want to grow up quickly. Drinking and smoking is a way of seeming older, more confident and responsible. No one can make you grow up quickly you choose to. We are expected to act our age, but how should our age act? No one answer that. As for me, I'm trying to get younger and more free, away from the knowledge that age brings with it.

      Ok is AND that short litytle kid that i was laughing at?  If it is or was (im confused) then I know who the heck he is.  If not I have no idea who u r on about!  Kes I am v. insulted that u 1/2 destroyed my blog:(  O well forgive and forget is the best thing to live by. Laura I have to totally agree with you.  i am gonna get all deep now and probably regret it but who gives a monkeys?  I think that the reason that people take drugs drink alchol etc etc is because through that they feel young again and they feel like they dont have a care in the world; they dont think about how that if they were not in the state that the were that if they jumped from the top of the stairs they would kill themselves.  I dont think that, that made any sence.  Basically the point I am trying to get at is that people now adays just grow up to darn quickly.  They start to think about to complex things at an early age.  I feel that schools are partly to blame for this because they expect little kids to know to much.  I have two things to prove this. My first day at Nailsea school, so I was just 11 years old.  Mrs Smith tells Leigh of for being to childish.  For goodness sake, thats because at the age of 11 you are still a child!  Or to me you are anyway.  The other thing was one of my first h/w's at Nailsea school was what is the meaning of life?  How was i ment to know that?  I was 11 for flips sake.  sorry if it seems that i have been ranting on for no reason what so ever, but i feel very strongly about things like that! New thing I wonder how sponge Bob square bum is?

      Uhuh... so kiddies been ok with out me? Sorry, I was out trying to find a life, but they're too hard to keep so I let it go! Hehe, not really! Helooo this is me, that anti-social girl of the year talking! Ok, ok, so I was watching tv ok? Nah, I had the two smells over and we watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail  again ! I'm still trying to get Izzy to watch 10th Kingdom! (It's sooo good!) And really funny. Ok, so I messed up the whole brackets thing but toody doo! Ahh... we were all talking about some one who we'll call... AND who likes Izzy! (If you know our friends you'll know who it is... or you won't and still be clueless, ah heck) *maybe it's an invisable guy Izzy made up!* Probably. Eeek, musn't say too many of my thoughts! Ahh yeah, then you'll find out that I'm actually mad, and I'd rather that you were stuck with the assumption that I was mad. (EH?) Eeek, shh mind! BACK to the point. Geez, really need to keep a close check on my mind! Any way, Izzy doesn't know what to say if AND asked her out, hell my life's just one big teen movie, or one crappy Peach Girl book... Stick with the movie... Ahh, it's late and I have to get up early to go into Brittol, buisisi!

      yes getting covered in sellotape was the highlight of my day. dont you miss the days when things were simple, like when you were little and you just didnt think about stuff. like, you did'nt think about that jumping from the top of the stairs to the bottom could potentially kill you. and when opal fruits were opal fruits instead of "starburst" i mean come on if you're gonna re-name possibly one of the best sweets ever made then you could at least do it well.  word of the day: snurdge (minor insult of the 60's-70's)

I tried to be smart and plug it back in but I was afraid my computer would go 'kablamo!' Yeah, so ahhh I'm ok I guess. I've been thinking too much again. Kind of hard though cause it's soooo COLD! Geez, winds of -9 oC? What's with that! Aaargh, I'm all soopy again *sad even*. The reason why I look so angry all the time is that I have no reason to be nice. Weird huh? When I was younger, people that I didn't know were horrible to me, so if I'm angry around them and they don't want to approach me then they have no reason to pick on me. I'd rather be a small insignificant blotch then a big spill.

      News is depressing because all the unhappy things in the world shadow the happy things. September 11th was supposed to be the International Day of Peace, but look at what it has become. If we become too wrapped up in happy things then we forget about all the people that don't feel this. I watch the news every night so I can feel in touch with the world  Life is too confusing.

      right I have thought this through before i type it and here are my views;  When i have a break from school, I tend not to follow the news because it ususally ends up depressing me, and also I'm not usually here to see it.  Ask me on again about any news story and I will be happy to talk, in the mean time just bug off.  That is if your going to ask me about the news.  I have also decided that Champain is yucky, and insted of having that at my wedding, WHEN i get married, I'll have Ribena, or orange squash.  A little thing to think about;  why when u visit a friends shud u take ur own cup, and always make  your own drink?  All will be reavelled on monday!

      Hmm... cloaning. Is it right to cloan some one? Technically they would be exactly the same as the person, but they might develop differently. Imagine growing up with people expecting you to be like some one, some one that you can't be. What if some one died and then a baby was cloaned from their genes. Imagine knowing that you are purely alive because of the person you got the genes off. Cloaning is a way of being 'god' and I'm not sure I agree with it. A baby who has the original genes of a sixty year old will infact have the frailty of their bones, is it fair to do that to some one?  Hmm.

      We all have perceptions of things, we assume too much. If some one says some thing, then we assume that they mean it *and that I can spell assume* We expect oxygen to be in the air tomorrow, we take it for granted that the world will be there tomorrow. We expect this web page to be here tomorrow, maybe we're assume, expecting whatever too much. Haven't you ever had it where some thing isn't there and you just accept that it's gone with a slight shock. We need to stop assuming things, if you take things for granted then you don't truely appreciate every thing around you. Life, how easily that can be taken for granted. What if it was taken away suddenly? I just think it's amazing to think that we're alive, we're on a planet and we're eating the world's food supply, that if equally shared out could fead the whole world. Open your eyes and unlock your brain.

Eugh no, lets not go down that road and turn left because it'll probably get me crawling over a dictionary checking the meaning of things. I hate that in english tests "Why does this make the story seem scary and horrific" Umm... well what do you mean by scary and horrific? Wow, completely changing the subject!  And needing a new pargraph badly. Wow, Lemon Jeeeely! (Or Lemon Jelly for all you normal people) Thank you dadorail for telling me about them! I heard this cool song where all it says is "All the ducks are swimming in the water" in Forbidden Plannet and they wrote it! So what, do I care if every one knows this already and they're number one? NO! Some one should make a "Freak persons chart" much better than the normal one!

Oh yeah, we went all out monty *how the hell do you spell it?* python *ditto* and the holy grail *err i'm not gonna even ask* watching! The Knights who say Ni! Oh, they're sooo cool! On the dvd version, it's got the Knights of Camelot Lego style! It's sooo cool! We have to make every one watch it! Ok... running out of energy and general things to say... bi!

      Hey, sorry I've not been going on this. Not that much to type about, you know. And I'm sure you love being bored. Ahh.. but yes, my head there's so much in there, but if I started telling you about that I'd probably have the men in white coats coming to take me away. Last time they did that, they took the lucozade off me. :( Actually! I have lucozade! Yeay! Sorry, I'm content at the moment, I just read a relaxing manga :) I just care about being relaxed don't I? The one thing that is hardest for me to be! *geez, I am relaxed, I can't word things very well!* Hmm it's interesting to be in this mood, to see where you mind wonders when you're not driven by emotion. Seeing as I'm listening to the weird music that is the start of fushigi yuugi, I'm scared by my brain. Hmm... guess it's a good thing that I don't get to explore it today - I've got things to do. *shock* Hey, don't go all out, I'm just gonna wrap some presents up and go 'HOLY SHIP!' because I'll realise I've got billions of pieces of homework. Isn't life fun?

       urlLink http://www.fictionpress.net/read.php?storyid=1187479  Damn I'm good. (Quick some one get a pin and pop her ego!) Uh... sorry about that sudden burst of... egoness? Now what's that clever word that I should -but don't- know? Lo siento, guess I'm going mad!  When I was younger, Heaven was so weird to me. Surely it must be full by now, Will there be room for me? Who gets to decide who goes to hell? Will I go there instead? So it's the creator that destroys what he created, Surely no one should have that power. But then he is god.  Now I am older, And heaven doesn't seem so weird to me. Because I have found it, Here on Earth. And I think I'll stay instead.  Yes... mad. I've got kind of stuck on this song by S.E.S called Dreams Come True, but hell it's in Japanese and I can't find it any where! :'(

I found a currency convertor! Finally, I actually know how much things cost! Ahh. Oh yeah, I'm ill today, that's why I'm not at school. I actually had some damn freaky dreams! One was where my mum died, and I was gonna see this lady he liked... apart from I was in the PE changing rooms after we had had PE and suddenly Mango appeared, so I ran down to the gate and threw him out. Loads of guys were there, and they were saying 'did you see those two things' and some one said 'one of them you might have seen, one of them you shouldn't have seen' or some thing like that, then one of them said 'one of them was a skull and wearing a tutu'. So Death of Rats and Death were in my dream! *Read Thief of Time to get it* C'est tres bizarre! Mmm... other freaky stuff happened but I forgot it. Oh, I also dreamt some one poked me in the head and it woke me up. (Weird huh?) Definatly ill, I always get freak dreams when I'm ill! Ahh I better go do some thing ...useful because it's becoming hard to type and spell *must be illness kicking in* or it's just me... Hmm... definatly me.

      Have you ever wondered why people are like that? Okay, so maybe I psychoanalyse *no, no, i'm not clever. i'm sure it's spelt wrong* people too much (or maybe it's because I'm listening to Goo Goo Dolls) Hmm. Why do people ignore you? Why do you ignore them? Maybe you're ignoring the fact that you don't or do like them or some thing. (I'm sure there's too many inuendo's to list in that!) Why do some people go out of their way to make your world worse, why do they go out of their way to make it better? But then, if you analyse things too much then you don't live, you watch. It's hard.

WILLIES TO THEM ALL! willies especially to mr.thackray who failed to mention that we have a maths challenge tommorrow. how shite is that? willies willies willies. merde.merde.merde. shizercroft. okay i dont know how to spell shizercroft so im just gonna guess! wow dado rail what an damn cool name. well ill be off now. before i freak you out any more.

      Every one has different priorities. Randomness! Every thing is simple, we make it difficult. Or at least I do. Take this for example, walking past a door. Normal people just walk past it, I however have to trip on the mat and throw myself at the wall or hit the door frame. Or maybe it's just me... Do you really think that every thing changes? That scares me! Change always does, I think that's more scary than the thought of change scaring me, the fact that it does. All the major changes in my life haven't been the best ones. I figured that if I stayed the same, no one would notice me and they would have no reason to pick on me or any thing. If you become the backround then no one will see you. Sadly that doesn't work. Bugger, aye? Some people pick you out of the backround for no reason and turn you into the foreground, because they're actually cowards who are trying to cover up the fact that they're cowards. People always try to cover up their insecurities by pointing them out on other people, maybe it's like a cry for help or some thing.  This was from ages ago but my computer wouldn't work! But it's better now... Yeay! *read next blog for uninteresting info on it*

      do you know that one of the biggest beliefs in buddhism is impermanence. nothing is permanent. everything will change and the more you learn to accept that the happier you will be. that makes a lot of sense, not saying im ready to become a fully-fledged buddhist or anything but a lot of buddhist beliefs make a lot of sense. dukkha is suffering and it is said that people suffer because they don't understand that things constantly change. i think it's true that people can change but the trouble is people like rosie + others dont think about that they should change they just think about not wanting to. maybe that does'nt make a whole lot of sense to people outside my head, but oh well.

      Eek. Sorry I've been ignoring this. I've had mocks all week - stupidity all around, and I've been affected. To tell you the truth, I'd rather be alone than in a crowd. Weird huh? Sad, yup. I was thinking about that... seriously shouldn't be musing about that on this now should I? But it's good to think... in your head at least. Some people don't like to hear thoughts, but it's good to share them. What would happen if we didn't? Hitler? Hmm... see what happens when I think? Well... eugh, let's talk about test. (Fun...) Yeesh, can't believe I'm doing the mocks of the mocks! What's up with this world? (Under pressure... dum de di dum dum) Umm... yeah... guess I've have gone a bit crazy under the pressure. I'm also a bit annoyed that they didn't put cool stuff on the tv! It's all been crap! (During the day I mean, normal school hours) The tests were stupid though, every one finishes about half an hour early, but they can't let us go! Eugh, I've had enough, any way I've only got three left - Biology, Maths and Music! (Aaargh! Music's too hard!) *pull yourself together!* Really need to get out more!

      Hey. So woo. Tests. Not only tests, but study leave. Hmm... study leave to do tests in? Weird. Sorry... just find it weird. Either that or I'm tired... *zzzz* Yup, tired. I was the living dead in school today, mixture of stress, lack of sleep and protesting (it takes up a lot of energy!) Yeah! Hey! I'm a celebrity! I was on GWRfm! I hope they put my point across ok... and didn't make me sound ba (I probably did that any way) Who needs editing when I can muck up for you! (...) But it was fun and we got our point out, we were heard! (In the wrong light in some cases) But we spoke louder than the politicians. (I think we did!) Well... I'm really bored... there's nothing to do! I'll have to arrange all this stuff to do next week, but I'd rather just laze around. Oh, feel free to come to my house *people that I know* and do... whatever. Just don't paint it green... I hate green. Oh, and I'm broke! Fun! Oh geez... depressing music, well I'm kind of down and I don't know why... *sniff sniff* It all starte- *We don't want to know about your twisted life* Oh right... stick to the non-existant point, got it. Mmm... well better go talk protesting with my brother. Remember -  No one's life is worth it

      Anti-war protesters in Bristol! Yeah! And I was one of them! Yes, I'm a student. And I wan't to tell you. We weren't truenting - we were voicing our opinions and protesting. I was proud to be one of the many. And I am proud to have made a difference. I would rather have not protested, but the war started so we stopped. If George Bush is so high and mighty then why is he supporting the innocent murders of Palestinians by Isrealies? Surely they are terrorising people. That man has double standards. Go support our cause, and find out more if you are a student.  urlLink http://www.studentstopwar.org.uk/index.php  FLY MY PRETTIES INTO THE NIGHT! Yeah... getting a bit serious, I always use 'humour' when things get serious. Some situations shouldn't get too depressing. You always need a spark of the alternate emotion to bring you back to Earth.

Found the funniest game in the whole world!  urlLink http://www.wedu.com/sledrun/tobogganrun.php  Toboggan jump! Yeah! Just the kind of stuff we need, being near test time and all. It's so fun!

      War teaches you how to hate and not how to decide things.  A little bit of philosophy for you there.  I'm sorry i am not allowed to walk out, dont know why but all i know is that I aint happy about it.  Im getting really sick of people saying what difference will it make.  for all they know it could be the thing that finally pushes good old Tony over the edge!  You dont know untill you try. xx

      Hey. Anti-war, non-eating-non-fair-trade slightly-hippy person here. So, what are you doing about the war? We're gonna walk out of school and protest in Bristol! YEAY! Well, I think some people got it wrong, they were walking into school when I walked out (at the end of school, not an actual protest thingy) Hmm... Yeah! WALK IN! Woohoo! (I some how don't think that it's gonna catch on guys!) Mmm... Also we're gonna protest in the middle of our school during school time! YEAHHH! (Look out for me, future world wide human rights activist) Yeah right, probably in some crummy factory job or some thing... any way! Aaargh! I'm getting really annoyed by people who 'don't care' about the war, or think that 'nothing we can do can change the situation'. Yeah. Tried that already in France. Remeber Le Pen? He would have become the next racist leader if the people had not come out in force and stopped him (the fact that their current president is actually corrupt doesn't really matter...) Mmm... Well. I'm changing what I want to change. I'm not eating any chocolate, apart from fair trade chocolate. Mad? Nope. I just believe in ethics, and I want to feel good in my heart as well as my stoumach, don't worry, I'll still eat as much! (When this damn lent thing is over!) It's good to do lent though, it makes you think about things. (Don't ask how, haven't got there yet) Hey I better go. Adios.

Oh well, doesn't seem that hard to me now, seeing as coco bean people are being ripped off, and I'm anti-Nestle, not much chocolate that I want to eat! Fun! I better go do stuff, sorry!

      Some people are just cruel. For no reason. And some people like those people? Why? Because they're pretty. Because they laugh when they're required to. Because they don't give a shit. Should we really respect these people, just because they are 'pretty'? And what effort do they put into looking 'pretty'? Should we respect them for that? And when they pick on people who work so hard to do well, should we laugh? If we laugh then we just fuel their idea that they are doing well. The 'pretty' people I've so far met are mostly stuck up whores, but that's only the people that I've met. Oh, when I mean 'pretty' I mean down right ugly, but some people like that sort of thing.  Have a nice day thinking.  Hate mail welcome. ;P

      Geez, this play list at the moment is gonna melt my brain if I listen to it any more. *i'm weird* Some times you have to be happy with what you got. Ahh, then there's greed. Why must their always be greed? To keep us alive I guess, if we always have some thing to aim for, some thing to look forward to, then we will keep going. If you get nothing out of some thing then you probably won't do it. *probably? aahhh!* Doesn't life make sense when I explain it? *no*

      Deaf of the screaming, Blind of the sights. Senseless to guide, Into the night. Numb from the cold, Scarred from the pain. Shielding the others, I'd do it again. Looking out the window, Into the sky. Waving at death's wagons, That fly easily by. Cursing the men, That sit in the seats. Wondering if, I will be kissing their feet. With death they come, With god they will leave. They are more powerful, The can do as they please. God can't you hear me? Screaming for help. With my burned out throat, And my burned out core. God can't you hear me? I can't take this any more! I'm staring at you. Safe in the sky. Oh how much I want to, Take off and fly. The bombing won't stop, The dying won't stop. What did we do to deserve this? Deaf of the screaming, Blind of the sights. Senseless to guide, Into the night. Why try to live, When I will die. Fearless I step, Into the sky. Dead already, Wasn't that lucky? I didn't suffer, I wanted to die.

      Hmm... geez it's too dark in here! I hate it being dark! *not that I'm afraid of the dark* Nahh... that was when I was younger. And for the record! ...I was more afraid of the toilet monster. :| Go figure. Woohooo psychological jargon! (Most of it is!) If you study something too much then you may miss the real meaning. (That's what I keep telling myself!) But seriously, if everyone studied stuff too much no one would live! On that minute point *seriously minute* what do you do when you do nothing? You know... when you're really trying to think about nothing. I play piano in the air. Hell, at least I'm not thinking about actual stuff! It's bad to do that! Well sometimes. When you get all caught up in it, and you forget the breathe then it's bad! *geez it's hard remembering how to spell breath and breathe!* Well I guess someone had to say it! (And it had to be me *sigh*) Any way... I'm ill and tired. Night night.

What good is staying in your house if you have no chocolate! Also my dad kind of isn't talking to me *he's ill too* I 'threw' *dropped* the remote and he had a major go at me. Apparantly I'm a good outlet for anger and sicky stress. Oooh fun. *thud* Really gotta do something about my head! Mmm... I think I'm gonna have to kick some virtual butt on Little Fighter 2! (Soooo boooorreeed!) Ahh! Yeay! I can watch Neighbours twise! (Oh dear GOD!) *zzz*

      When I say I don't care I do. Some times when I say I do I don't. Double meanings. HOW DAMN COMFUSING DOES THIS WORLD HAVE TO BE!!!! (Very) Why? For blogger obviously! It's the only thinking keeping me sane! (Hehe, probably making you madder but hell, some one's gotta have the excess madness!) Hmm... just feel like going aaaaaahhhhh in school!

      Heeey. I've decided. I need new knees and a new ear... hmm... might as well get rid of the whole head! Do you think I'd be able to get them on Ebay? Well... they've got virtually everything for sale! *clueless* Aaargh, my head hurts! Geez isn't it static? (When you're hair all goes paton) Mmm, I'm sure everyone understood that! Well, I'm back at school... and life's gonna start to drag again *sigh* why does it have to drag? (More like scrape) Why can't it roll or.. erm... slide? It just kind of gets to a point where it's like ...why bother? Well, I'm not quite sure what I'm going on about *side affects of head ache* So I better quit while I'm not there. Sorry... everything seems so pointless at the moment. :( Bleurgh, I hate feeling like this! I'm gonna go... go... sleep! Yeah!  I feel like I'm going crazy, I don't breathe enough. And yet all the time, I think too much. Why is it that I think through life, And don't live it? I am walking through this life, Outside my body but inside my face. Living in fear, Of all my mistakes. Waiting for the past and the future, To colide into one. Waiting for them to crush me. Wondering what I have done.

Along with soluble fish... hmm... this would have to be a pretty dumb dictionary. *looks to you* Hey! You've got to be dumb if you've actually got this far in the blog! *EUGH* Soo any way *quickly changing the err unidentifiable subject into a even more unidentifiable subject* (EH?) Umm... flowers? Okay pretty bad but any way. I'm just sitting here waiting for my phone to ring... any second now... Don't you hate doing that? Knowing *slightly* that some one's gonna ring, but being unable to phone them. Wait a second. No. That's probably just me. I blog too much don't I? Mmm... way too many anti-climaxes today. (Piano pieces actually, there's this big build up a then a *twang* that's supposed to be the ending chord! What is with that?!) Argh I'm supposed to be writing one! I can't remember how fanfares go! *thump = head hitting table* God I'm gonna fail music! Oh yeah, I saw Johnny *can't spell* English yesterday, we were the oldest people -minus the kids- there! Never mind... Oh and it was incredibly stupid if you're into that type of thing. (And I am)

I'm in my house... all alone... and scary moving people are outside the window! *smile and run* Nah it's ok really, my neighbours are moving. It's really tight on their kids, they were crying the other day :( poor kiddies. Must be really stressful. I don't really want to find out what it's like. Isn't it really weird to think that your parents, the people who have been together all your life could split up? That would really make me question the stability in relationships or some thing like that... But don't! Relationships are good... relationships are good.

You know, when you go all serious and don't have fun, mostly cause you're not with your friends.... aaah better phone Izzy... are we doing any thing tomorrow? (Probably) Hehe... so much for being arranged! Yep, English totally doesn't make sense! Or maybe it's my use of it that's flaud (Both?) Never mind. I've gone all arty at the moment, I'm trying to do some 'painting' *eeeeeeeee* Not good. And general lets think about life thingy. DAMN! NEED MINSTRELS! More like E numbers. Am I actually this boring in real life? Yep, definatly one of these 'i am not worthy oh god of pink bunny flowers'. AAAH listening to Beetles. AAAH! MISSING SIMPSONS! AAAH haven't phoned Izzy! AAAH AAAH! Definatly need to get out more. Some one come and drag me out of my house please! AAAH BEATLES STILL ON! Phew, it's only... Crosby, Stills, Nash? and Young? Who the hell?

      HEEEY! I'm BAAACK!!! *from Prague...) ^_^; Uhh... yeah... Well, it was really fun! (I can't believe Cardiff was the hottest place in Europe on Thursday!) Prague is really nice... it's full of Baroque buildings and all the architecture *just pretend that's readable* was amazing! It was even kind of hot! *yeay!* Only bad bit was me on the plane back, my ear was completely gunked up with wax so when we landed it absolutly killed ^_^* (still does!) So now I'm deaf in my right ear! YEAY! And then it hurt to breathe when I was trying to go to sleep *at home* so I kind of woke my mum up and fainted... then it was alright! So if I just forget about the last bit of Thursday, it was great! Is it Friday...? Ahh! So it is! Ahh.. only had about 70 bits of spam floating around in my soup, so that's alright! Any way... Prague. It's Czech Republic's capital! (That took about five minutes to work out how to spell it... I'm tired ok!) It was really amazing because it was full of so many different nationalities, there were French, Spanish, German, Dutch, English and Czech people! And Prague was covered in amazing stuff! *slightly in awe* Ahh... and I loved Charles Bridge. It was covered in amazing statues, and had people playing music all along it (and shops *teehee*) I got this cool fish bracelet from there! We heard a load of jazz, it was really cool! It was actually a really cultural place... hmm... I think I  am  crazy. I really need to stop talking to myself/brick walls. Which one's worst? I've been having one of those 'oh crap i'm so stupid' days, you know? Like when you think about things that have happened and realised that some stuff completely went over the top of your head! I hate that! Hmm.. soluble fish. Cool eh?

(Hehe... actually I'll probably find a internet bar some where so I can delete my junk mail!) *sob sob* All the mail I get it junk! Unless... I'm deleting all the non-junk mail. ^_^; Hehe... Eeek! Nahhh! Any way... zzz... so tired! Ooooh! I better go phone Izzy, she thinks that lent is over on Monday! (Dumbo!) Aaah! She might break the fast a few days before it ends! That would be bad! Okay, so I'm hyper on the net, but whacked out in real life... why can't it be the other way around?  What if we died in silence, No on heard the scream. What if no one saw, The body that was never seen. Why won't some one stop them, The murderers in the world. Why won't some one help us, Bring peace to all. When it is right in front of you, Staring you in the eyes. Why won't some one help, The Palestinian's lives.

Mmm... feeling pretty useless and unworthy at the moment, but hey, I'm me. The mood changing colour ring girl. Yep... what colour... hmm... turqouise? Yeah!

      I seem to have a problem in life, I remain unable to fakely laugh. I am friends with who I want to be, If I don't like you, Then you don't like me. However I am surrounded by Jesters who play, And fakely laugh every single day. People who go out into space, Just for a chance to spite me. I don't want to be, Stuck in a miserable world like this. Help me break free.  All 'poems' on this are done by me - stilldreaming *pen name* kes *fake real name!* YEAY!

      Hey. I've been having kiddy days. My brother's gone wacho and we're having kiddy fights. Life is fun. :) Oh, then nojh *pronounced nodge, actually john* has gone all excited about playing rounders with a big stick... my conclusion? Obviously the laughing gas has become a part of the atmosphere! Ahh, and that's good! I hate becoming too stiff and serious, that's gotta be bad! Oh, did I tell you about all the stupid things we've been doing? It's been getting worse recently! Teehee, must be teenage rebellion against all the boring adults. We were actually having fun in PE the other day! I stepped into the long jump and got a 1m30, and Izzy cartwheeled into it! Ha! Dig our crappy rebellion against PE! YOU CAN'T FORCE US TO DO ANY THING! that we don't want to do. Eat a whole chocolate cake... definatly a yes! Ehe... see kiddy mood! Lately I've been too old mood, but I'm getting into stroppy teenager mode! YEAY!

      Sitting here laughing, Hearing the sound bounce back. When will some thing absorb it, And listen to it for me? Sitting here crying, Wishing for comfort not grief. All I can think of is my lonleness, As the puddle forms at my feet. I drowned from my tears, My ears burst from the sound. Laying there dead, Under the cold solid ground. Why didn't it absorb it my fears?  What will protect me now?

      Ahhh... I think I'm having a start of my life crisis. Where is every one...? I finally went on MSN after years of ...not being bothered (i'd had enough!) And then I go on it... and no one's on. Oh, and I used to go on this chatroom, where I knew every one (and was a foot) *...* And I was gonna go back on... but then I realised that I haven't been on it for years and I wouldn't know any one! I need a community! (Jeez) Hmm... I was thinking about taking Tae Bo classes or some thing (with Laura of course) or maybe ruling the word. (Learning to spell would be better) Sorry about randomness, I've been playing on LF2 : Little Fighter 2! It's so much fun! You get to kill people! In the game of course... ^_^

      I pull my hair, In front of my eyes. To protect my face, To keep up my disguise. I take a step, And wobble inside. I am the pillar, That has demised. Some body reveal me, Some body help. Some body protect me, From the dark of myself.

      Ahh... so physically drained. Yeesh, I feel like I'm gonna faint. Damn exams... *yawn* I'm going alright so far, I've got three results back; English - A, History - A*, Chemistry - 67%. (I almost put Chimistry, that's how bad I am at it!) Ahh I should be find... mind over matter, I've been doing a lot of that recently. Or is it mind over mind? Ahh... sooo tired, I keep typing the wrong stuff sorrrry! Hmm... but I did badly in chemistry... well... kind of.We do three sciences and get two GCSE's for it! How whacked is that? Mind you, doing three GCSE's in the sciences is supposed to be hard! *i'd rather do one!* Aggh, my right ears packed up! STUPID SCHOOL! (Ahh, you can blame school for every thing!) I HAVE NO LIFE! STUPID SCHOOL! (Well... maybe not that...)   Has every one been following the war on the news? It's so different on Sky news and BBC news. We don't really know what's going on though. Half of it's propaganda, and the other half is rumours, what is going on? Every point of view is bound to be biast though. Oh, and we should care. This is happening because we can't stop it. People are dying. We should at least try. Why create more deaths and suffering, when there's already too much in the world? Why bother? As some person said, (or my mum :P not sure) truth is the first victim in war.   Ooh, meaninful point: we shouldn't take things at face value. I found a point! *finally!* I have meaning in my life! (Oh dear God)

Why can't I be the one, Who has fun in this world! Maybe my release, Comes from my bounds. It's some thing that I'm searching for, Some thing that wants to be found. Won't you help me up, Or will you fill in the hole? Did you know, That your deeper than you look, It's true for us all.  AN: Deeper as in... deep thinking, deeply psychological!

But then maybe it matters to me, Your hyper little kitty, On her cute pink LSD.  Realisation is the biggest disappointment.

      Bonjour my little things!!!!  im sat here still doing maths coursework and i have done it all bar the flipping nth term, as i have no idea how to do it.  hence the reason that i am sat here frantically surfing the net for some help at this tiem of the morning so that mayby just mayby i can have some kind of social life this afternoon!!  my little holiday was fun.  i went to a river with my devonian friends and had to prove that the water would not go over my head, and got wet and sunburnt in the process.  i went to the beach and went in the sea upto my waist in my swimming cossie.  it was a little funny as mum had put my suncream on when i had my tanktop on and she missed a bit on both shulders, so i now have these two burnt lines on my shoulders and they hurt, o well, it was fun!!

      ¿Por que Bill Gates llamo a su sistema operativo 'Windows'   ('Ventanas' en ingles), si lo podria haber llamado 'Gates' ('Puertas'   en ingles)? *accents taken off, blogger doesn't like them apparantly* Teehee, that made me laugh *give me a break, I'm doing spanish coursework! It says something like:  Why did Bill Gates call his operating system *or something like that* 'Windows'  ('Windows' in English) when he could have called it 'Gates' ('Gates'  in English)?  Don't ask. I was looking for English in the i section of the English - Spanish dictionary. Get it, inglish? Makes looooads more sense!  urlLink http://www.sitiodesordos.com.ar/los.htm   Look at number 29. It says something like:  If a person with multiple personalities decides to commit suicide... can they be consider to have taken hostages?  Ahh...  urlLink babel.altavista.com  Translate here. Mmm... it's a bit weird actually.  Remember: Fish may be pink, People may be blue. But sure as hell, That smell is you.

And yes... it's a beautiful day and I'm doing ENGLISH COURSEWORKK!!! AAARGHHHH!!! Eugh... I feel like my brains melted inside my head... (I had a brain?!?!?!!) Yeesh does get a bit tiring though... 5 pages on size 10! *save me!* Oh don't worry, still got Spanish, Maths and Chem and Hist homework to go!

      Ahh... so tired... I got a bit of heat stroke so I'm really tired... and I've been trying to do coursework! Some how I've ended up with all my coursework to be done in the holidays, the teachers probably think that the other teachers don't do that, but then they all do! (Maths coursework must be getting to me, I really don't make any sense) Any way... yeay! I'm back from Harrogate! Woohoo *zzz* I had fun trying on my bridesmaid dresss *eugh* it didn't make me look like erm... bad or anything which was good *sometimes they do... must be the bride flaunting her power over it* and my Auntie has a massive hat for the day *apparantly, no one can take their hat off until the mother of the bride has taken hers off* which gives her a load of power! (Ahh well... I'll just hit some one with my pose, or stand really close to someone with hay fever) *muhehe* Heeeheee, we saw this guy in a open top car with a inflatable woman dressed up in a red wig and a fancy dress! Yeah, go guy who doesn't give a damn! *and cheese snaps to the rest of us* Err... it's the heat stroke... Mmm. Oh, and I got my ears pierced but no one notices! It is me or are my blogs disappearing? *I'm going mad again* My pills! My pills! Where are they?! Mmm... maybe I need to electronically tag them ---*cut here*--- Really needed to end that randomness! Need a new head... need... mmm something. I'll find out some day what I need. *I actually need to go to sleep* Geez, I'm always really sleepy. *zzz...*  urlLink http://pub44.ezboard.com/fthelionsgrovediscussionfrm21.showMessage?topicID=103.topic  That's just boringly weird!

We got a load more suc- I mean friends to give us money- no, no, I mean sponser us. *to what, go on holiday?* No, the culture the culture!!! Yeah... *teehee fools* Well anyway, I'm gonna be in Harrogate from Sunday to Wednesday this week. *God help me, I'm trying on my bridesmaid dress* Geez... so long as I don't breathe every thing should be fine... yes fine...

      HEY! I'm baaaackkk! *aaahhh! run for cover!* (dig a hole and stay in it) Yeesh, I really have needed to talk to any one pointlessly for ages... I've missed you blogger! *big hug* That wasn't pointless or anything... (Could've been spelt better!) Any way onto pointless ramblings.... Today I watched Russain Arc *Yes, I put arck* which is the first film to be filmed in one continous shot! Woohoo, go Russians! (Which involved watching a lot of subtitles and getting annoyed when they didn't put any on for some people) Geez, before it started this guy behind me was talking too loudly... God he was annoying. He started off saying stuff like how there's no basis for a relationship unless 'she's' attractive, even thjough before he was saying he was like 40 with two kids *what a catch* Like that guy can be picky. Then he was saying how these 16 year olds wouldn't go out with him *for god sake, don't let him be referring to us!* and the person next to him was trying to comfort him. I was gonna turn around and go 'no one would' but I didn't. Actually I probably would have punched him and said something really memorable... why can't I ever think of anything memorable?! *probably because when i do say something like that, I say a million things after it so it becomes less memorable* Ahh, I see.

      Ahh yet another can't-work-out-what-your-trying-to-tell-me school day. Some how you're supposed to psychologically figure people out, it's hard some times. What are you supposed to think of people when they obviously lie to your face? Are you supposed to believe everything that you hear? Who invented popcorn? Mmm... there's a lot of psychological stuff that people don't pick up on, gets a bit annoying though. When some one asks to borrow a pen, are they actually asking for a pencil? Well not... but inuendo in a way I guess. Hmm... And what are you supposed to think of people who obviously lie to you? Do they not respect you or some crap like that? Aargh school's too hard, it's too hard to try to understand people. (How the hell do you do that?) *...guess?*

      Hey! I went to a barn dance yesterday! It was fun! Half way through we all had to go out because nextdoor they were doing this show, and they forgot to put the smoke covers over the fire alarms and they had some smoke or something *breathes* Then two fire engines turned up, and this lady started taking photos so I started to hide. YEAY! It was really fun though! It was my brother's girlfriends thingy, but he didn't turn up till late cause he was with his friend at the hospital who broke his leg. *aww* But he ended up dancing really stupidly with his friend, then the rest of his friends started doing it, got a bit crazy. Then Lynne requested YMCA at the end, and I did it backwards *took a lot of brain work, at least I'm doing something with it!* Uh yeah... isn't this pointless? Never mind! It's damn interesting boring! YEAY! Let's all go eat erm... bourbons! *drool*

      Isn't it really sad how Britain's really un-European? We sit here on our tiny island, sticking to our language and not even realising what amazing stuff is out there. No one speaks anything apart from English, our music charts are ridiculed by sad English pop music that you can't even compare to some of the international stuff, and yet we're European. We don't even take the Euro. It is sad! There's all this amazing songs, art and stuff that we don't even bother to look at. *majorly changing the actually good point* I wanna learn Spanish well! :'( Not just so I can sing along to Manu Chao... really... I wanna go on holiday to Spain and not be arrogant to think that they speak English. I don't want to be arrogant or ignorant.

Ok... so now it's ruined, let's start again. George Bush, the weapons of MASS destruction are here. Funny huh! Oh yeah... I forgot about all the backround information! Well Southampton are playing *or were* the FA Cup final today at Cardiff's ... *won't even try to spell* stadium. (Ok, so they lost but oh well) Have you ever had a dream where you're actually some one else? When I was younger I used to have it, I would get all worried because they wouldn't know anything about my house, where to go or what to do. Why didn't I just screw up there lives? Because I was too worried about them doing that to mine! Ok... so enough of the freak lesson that goes nowhere... I hear you, I hear you. Umm... I just kind of broke Kazaa...

      Hmm... damn cats. I came back from Izzy's to find my mum screaming and pointing at a bat. Yes, a bat. My cats caught a bat. I hate that, how they have to catch something just because they're cats. Supposedly it's a present, I guess it shows that they care. But sadly I don't think my wardrobe this summer will appreciate a bat purse. *it's tiny* Ok... bat thimble then. Ahh, I really need to go to sleep and... sleep. *I actually read for ages* I'm so sure you didn't need to know that. My handy furniture friend has just told me about Cadbury's latest marketing ploy, putting: "Do not eat if seal is broken" on Cadburys Animal Biscuits. Must be some conspiracy so you have to buy another packet! *Don't worry if you don't get it at first, took me about five minutes* I think I use the word conspiracy too much. Inuendo. There are too many. With the lovely corrupted French Government, and our totally unpopular doesn't-do-what-the-public-wants government, and let us not forget the American elections *sigh* Now weren't they just a bundle of twine? *laughs actually, couldn't be bothered to type it though, trying not ot go to sleep without pressing publish*

Or maybe in my sleep I turned them inside out... *hehe both spellings in! one of them's gotta be right!* The weirdest was waking up when I was really young in a cocoon! *my douvet was kind of wrapped around me really tightly* I had to roll onto the floor to get out of it! *freaky kid* Yeah... I used to hide all my toys under the douvet cause I thought the toy monster would get them! Then when I would find them on the floor, it only proved it! *FREAK* I only had half a bed! Then I used to think that if I didn't sleep upside down, under the douvet the vampires would get me. Then I would forget how to go to sleep. Geez, getting to sleep was a big deal for me! *cause my brother was taken ill in the morning and couldn't wake up or some weird freak thing like that* Nope, just me. Mmmm...

Nah just kidding - it's so quiet around here all of a sudden! Apart from people shouting across the IT classroom (Pete, Chris) and Beki obbsesively trying to beat her previous score on Clevermedia arcade. Wow I haven't done any blogging for ages. *sniff sniff* need to excersise writing skills somehow without blogger - argh! It doesnt help being a slow typer, it takes ages to convey anything! The should invent computers where you could just write with a pen on theis board-thing and the writing would come up on the screen! WoW! I'll just be sending plans off to microsoft now... nevermind if they're evil...how are they evil exactly? I'm a very anti-evil anti-capitalist anti-globalisation kinda person but what have microsoft actually done? I'd be interested to know. Oh well there's always Intel. Im just blabbing randomly now (It really is quiet without you, katie!!!) so anyway... don't you feel like a chopping board? Damn, I alwyas get that feeling. Uh huh.    Soooooo anyway I'm kinda pooed off cause its all sunny for a change and im  having to spend my lunch time in the PC room AGAIN doing graphics stuff...boooooo...GET BETTER!!

To your foot! *why does feet always come into it?* I hate looking at people and thinking 'why are they alone?' cause everyone's so great! *hypocrite* No one should be alone. *that's why i annoy people so much, cause i don't like leaving people alone* Ah yes, this is why I'm alone! *oh well* Scary huh?

Thus proving that teachers are trying to brain wash us into liking certain things! *it gets weirder* I had a dream that my earing had ripped out but my ear was alright and I couldn't get it back in! What a freak dream. Oh yeah... AHHH must change the music!  From the Guardian (12 Nov 94), re: Paul Ridout, one of the British backpackers kidnapped in India by Kashmiri separatists, and recently freed: The first thing he had done after arriving home was to eat some Marmite on toast. "It was pretty good. It's just one of those thingsyou get out of the country and it's all you can think about."  Yeah... hmmm... I don't think that I would be thinking about marmite if I was kidnapped!  urlLink http://www.gty.org/~phil/marmite.htm#wherebuy  And don't ask how I got onto a site about Marmite!

I told my mum cat, but if you think about it... cats just eat crap and sleep *that's me! ;)* So that's not exactly an ideal reincarntion. But what is? I don't recon a human is the best form to be in *if we are in a form* We can lie, and are deceptive. We're also extremely selfish and destroy the environment around us *purrrr* Shh! Damn second half of my soul *mumble mumble* Aww.... Mango's with me! *so's my box of celebrations! teehheee!* No, I am not feeding my cat chocolate if you were wondering... worth a try though! (I'm gonna be seriously dangerous when I'm let loose on the world!) Hmm... don't you find that you always get the wrong end of the knife? *wrong end of the stick is just a boring saying!* Anyway... knife works better metaphorically so :P!

Mmm... wasn't I going to take off my e-mail address so I get no more sep*tic tank info! *have to do the * otherwise I will* Geez, privacy doesn't exist now! Quite scary! Read 1984 and you'll understand how scary! (It could be 1982... I'm never sure!) Or go watch Gravitation and go 'hmm' until you get to the 2nd one! Err... yeah dammit I control your life!!! *now THAT would be scary! Trust me, it would. I'ld probably have you eating peanut butter with cheese! *mmm* I... have to... go now... *mmm peanut butter and cheese* to do homework and play the piano! (Pfft. Yeah right!)

Like the lack of careness *caring* yes, yes, whatever shut up! (Like there) But people don't seem to notice, the world's so cold. It's scary. Like the girls who are obsessed with themselves and their problems, and try and convince you that breaking their nail is worse than anything that could ever have happened to you. *bitter sounding* Well... I've had to put up with it enough, we all have. What about *the children!* No, what about the people who are dying because they don't have any food, that simple thing could save them. What about people who have been ill for their whole lives and are waiting to die? Oh, but you're right. Nails are important, aren't they? *i think too much*

It er -cough- didn't rain one speck... *it rained several large oceans instead* Don't worry... that didn't stop us from going on four 5 mile walks! *and they were uphill loads!* But hell, it was fun! *especially playing Happy Familys, I won!* Hehe... and due to our rutheless Pontoon betting, I won a load of Skittles! MUHAAHAAA! Not that I let it go to my head ;) And not that Izzy won everything else... oh, and not that she's overly OVERLY obsessed with her boy friend Pete. *sigh* It's tough being stuck with some one like that... kidding kidding, it was loads of fun! Woohoo, London on Tuesday! Don't worry, I'll be back on Saturday if you miss me.

I guess you don't really want to hear about the inflatable cabbages. *mmmm* Uh - actually, there weren't any, but hey you missed out on the 'posh' food on plates at the wedding. (Ok, so food on plates sounds a little bit stupid, I mean the stuff that the waiters / waitresses carry around.) *FOOD ON PLATES?* Err... Anyway, I brought the tone down by 'gracefully' falling on my butt *which is hard to do!* My brother threw a tooth pick down my dress, and I stepped back and because the bottom of the dress was so tight I stepped back onto it and fell over! (Trust me, it's easy to do that!) *I guess you don't have to be there...* Ahh but I'm tired cause we were up on our feet for about 18hrs *zzz* so I made up for it today by staying in bed till 11! (pm?) Yep, I'm typing this in my sleep, freaky huh? But I'm gonna leave you all on your own on Tuesday! *again? sob sob* Hey, that almost sounded fake! *almost? drat!* I'm going on holiday to Exmoor with Izzy and my crazy travelling circus. *I'm the professional faller-on-her-butt-gracefully, we're a rare find!* Then I'm coming back next Monday, then going away again and I'll be back next next Saturday! *Not this one, the next one* Or was it Tuesday? I dunno... the 2nd of August! And wooohooo! School holidays! YEAAAAYYYYY! *On Tuesday for me, WEDNESDAY for every one else! MUHAHAHAAA!* I love being special! :D

Or you can... wait a minute check for your pulse! *I couldn't find it once in science, so technically I was dead* (Still am... MUHAHHAA!) Er, maybe not. It's weird, I'm listening to music from different nationalities with different languages!

      Well, Izzy et Moi had fun.  We went to the skate park with Pete and his friend.  Izzy took me along for some strange reason, and we kind of ignored Petes strange little friend, who is strange by the way.  We went to Tesco 3 times, and saw mrs Smith, and Petes Lemonade bottle fizzed everywhere so Izzy and I ran.  Its SOOO COOL there is now a zippy wire at the sotch horn park wotsit, its sooooooooooo fun.  I nearly pulled Izzy off it though.  So she chased me and i ran.  Then we came to my house had an ice lolly and she went home.  Which was good, and I have been online ever since!  HEHE.

(Have to buy some for Izzy ;P ) Shh, don't tell her. No really... I'm in doodoo now. (Just kidding) I always have to say that so people don't think that I'm actually serious, and to tell people when I'm serious *well duh* Sorry, I've been writing a letter for the people in Russia I stayed with, and you kind of have to speak straight English to them.

So I recon for a silver wedding anervisery thing u shud get ur folks a silver candle thing their quite cool and they come in all shapes colours and sizes. YAY!! I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sick of doing h/w and c/w all at the same time.  It is doing my little head in.  I really dont get the point of soooo much homework and coursework, do u?  I think that homework should be abolished.  it's mean and smelly and takes all night, quite literally, then I get lumbered with a stupid Graphics teacher, mentioning no names *Coumrsaundersgh* decides that he is going to check our work yesterday for today, fine spend 3 hrs doing it, does he check it NO.  GRRRRRRRRRRRR he is soooo annoying. Rite moan over.  I have smelly hayfever that smells and is annoying.  Kes I feel selfish all the time, but u never hear me complaining, k well mayby u do, but not that much, and they way i see it is people like u and me spend 2 much time thinking about the wellfare of other people and not about ourselves.  Ok well not all the time but sometimes is good. xx

      Geez I feel really selfish today for some reason... well, we all are I guess. But... I dunno, I guess I just get random weird feelings. When I was younger I used to get cravings for salami and carrots! Mind you, they were damn good carrots! I'm also more awake in the evening than in the morning, I'm really lazy when I get up. I also should be doing homework right now... Whoops. Oh well, probably only some Spanish stuff or something! Umm I should probably also be doing several other things simultaneously at this moment, but hell, Blogger needs me! Well... not so much as blogger needing me, but me needing blogger! Ahh I get dangerous if I can't write my thoughts down, too many, it gets cluttered in my small mind. It's good to record your thoughts I guess, then you have proof that you're sane (or not). Hehe... sanity. I have weird way of linking things though so maybe it's not too good for me to share my thoughts! But Blogger is good, hey, if it keeps you sane as a kitten it's got to have worked hasn't it! *shameless plug*

It's just hard to tell when to leave people alone, when they go off sulking, say that they're alright and to not worry you stay with them of course! But then some people get angry because they actually meant it. Hmm... I'm in a random mood I guess. Yeayyy! Cheese cake and salmon sandwhiches! *Mmm salmon* I actually like salmon now, all that force feading actually worked! (But it still smells, hah! They'll never convince me otherwise!) Ahh I've got one million and three things to do, but I really can't be bothered to do them! (It's always like that with me) Damn homework...

Eugh... what are you supposed to write for a 25th wedding anniversary? 25 years of emotions... Swimming in a botemless pitt.. Erm... I think I've confused me now! (I will rule the world!) If someone offered the world to you, would you take it? Someone was saying that they would, and would make it democratic, by having a representative from each country, but then you wouldn't have been elected so surely that's pointless. It would still be a dictatorship. I wouldn't! Simply because I don't want to corrupt myself or others. Yeeaaay, a morbid conversation! Woohooo! *morbid sounds cool*

But then it got better! *phew* Do you know what it's like spending a week with a family that speaks to each other in a different language?!?! (Well... apart from my family) Me = Martian . Them = Aquatic *whatever that is..* Oh dear... I really do suck at Spanish! Anyway, we eventually settled in and eventually we all found Russia amazing, the food was so great! *Yup, I suck at describing words today* (It's worse in Spanish!)

Oh err crap, apparantly it means this : I feel it for my lack of words and brain. AAARGHHH! I seriously can scare Spanish people with my lack of Spanishness!

And thismorning we had an argument about her stupid babyish clock being up on the wall, i mean, for gods sake, its got bloody teddy bears on it and it is soo lame! Did u c mars last nite, the brightest star in the sky it was, closer to the earth than it has been for 60,000 years, i saw it, i thopught it was quite cool being able to see mars but the rest of my family weren't convinced, my sis shouted 'take me home, i wanna go home' when she saw it which was rather amusing to say the least. Still doing homework, it is soooo boring, but i don't get half of it so i need to ask some of my teachers to explain it to me. hee hee! extra time! thats about it for today. xx

Anyway, breaking away from my musings, err to the err still non-existant point. *yup i came on here to make myself feel stupid, i reaaaly need a computer for that* Anyhoo, only a week away till school! Aaah! Okay, so it kind of sucks stretching my brain when it could be rotting in front of the tv, but it is fun to be around friends and mess about!

      hhhm, i have thought about that poemy thing, is it supposed to be about how we have come into this world and destryoed and everything horrible. hmmm.... i found out what nervous energy is.... apparantly it is has something to do with not be able to chill out and switch off so u burn alot of calories cos ur body wont relax or some thing along those lines.

      Hmm... feeling really deep and EUGH get me out of this mood! (You know?) It really is dangerous to leave me with myself... Anyway. Think about this.  There are too many people in the world to hurt, Too many things to see. Stolen souls seek their lives, Children learn how to grieve. I'm surrounded by the ocean of ignorance, Floating on the statue of me.  All the people have left the ocean. They've washed up on a beach full of rage. Wreaking havoc and destroying things, The leapt back into their cage.  No on is ever free from the ocean, Enlightenment is learning how to float. It's the curse of all human beings, That we can't learn to build a boat.

      well, not much to say really. didn't get much sleep last nite so am very tired. My sis broke our bedroom door, so there was light coming thru, and my sis and dad were snoring and oh, it was dreadful, i finally got to sleep at 2:30am, and then joy of all joys, my sis woke me up this morning at 8 o'clock, refusing to get on the scales so that my parents could see how much she weighed. I then shouted very sarcasticly, Thanks for waking me up, and managed to wake my bro up aswell. And everyone's blaming me. I then found i have lost a pound in weight instead of putting it on and my dad ses it is because i have alot of nervous energy (will have to look up what that is in a min) and because i don't sleep very well. And he has finally admitted that i am not anorexic because i have eaten more than normal over these hols and have still managed to lose that pound. They wanna know the secret to losing weight but i don't know how i do it. be bck in a sec just gonna find out what nervous energy is............

I know three peoples' GCSE results (cos they told me of course)..... Robyn got 3 C's and the rest D's, shes very happy with wot she got, Tim go 2A*, 5A's 4 B's and a C. Lynne do you remember the girl i pointed out at netball from plymouth and cornwall wing, called collette, well, apparantly she did really well, she got 8A*'s and 3A's which is amazing. I mean, I knew she was smart but i didn't realise quite how smart she was. Spent 50p credit which is all i had on my phone, txting tim about stuff. Thursday nite, got a phone call from robyn, the first time in ages i have actually spoken to her and not just emailed her or on msn msngr. She sounded really different, but thats what she s ses when she talks to me. She ses hi to you all, actually she ses hi to everyone i no and thats quite alot of people!! So am very happy because everything is okay in my world at the moment! hee hee! will blog l8r, xx, be happy, xoxoxox

Hehe... really should get that part of me kicked. Mmm... I know that everyone says it's better to get stuff out of the way, but for me it's something to do in the future... and when I have nothing to do... *not that I ever let that happen* I just feel wasted! Erm... yes... strange... Uhuh, probably some deep psychological problem running through there, but do I ever let that get in my way? Nope, being a rock suits me fine... *yup, gone* Anyway peeps and peepesses... *not that that is supposed to be offensive... not that that it... *yargh!** Yeah I have to go now... seeing as I actually have nothing to say...

I'm having weird vivid dreams. Last night it was a weird one about saving the Thunderbirds pilots from these 'villans' which was interesting... considering that I was trying to push this teeny 'car' along, when the people could have caught up with us in seconds... *don't worry, i bet i saved them... in the end.* Anyway.... how is everyone? Coping with the heat wave? *it just gives me an excuse for being lazy* I go through fazes of hyperness and lazyness, I guess it's when I think I have to try and when I don't! Mmm... I should start writing again, it's nice when no one tells you how bad at something you are. Muhaha, but I guess I'm not, confusion is a good point.

      You know those *oh shit i wish it wouldn't have happened to me* situations? I get into those a lot. I either speak my mind (to the wrong person), hit (the wrong or right person depending if it's a good day) or do something like that. And then I end up with one of my stupid apologies and run away. But it's not because I'm stupid *could be because I'm klutzy* it's more because I'm not afraid of people doing anything about it. Who cares who knows? I'm dangerous when I'm impulsive. It's not because I'm mean, it's just because I can't control what I say sometimes. *Damn impulses* It gets me into loads of trouble. And I've just been blocked! *Yeay! One down, and only a few thousand other people left who know of my existance!* But then... isn't it good to speak your mind? (I tend to do that sometimes) Most of the times it's my friend saying that she really wants to know my opinion about her new top, and me saying that I hate it. Their's a fine line between lying too much and hurting people. Don't you hurt people when you lie? WHO STARTED THIS DAMN THING OFF ANYWAY?!?!?!!!! *i blame cheese, it's always bad to eat it before you go to sleep* And then you end up thinking... maybe you should be left alone in that corner.

Why do we need to remember names anyway, thingy will do won't it?! Umm... yes... I do have things to do I guess.

Okay.. so maybe not today... but I was planning to do something today! (Yeah, yeah) Oooh... I can hear out of my ear again! (it sporadically goes *i love that word... i don't care about grammer ok?!* and i can't hear... which is sooo annoying! it's like being . . . unable to hear!) Mmm... I guess I just need some 'aaah isn't it lovely doing nothing' time. Mind you... if I had my way I would probably end up doing nothing the whole time, and that isn't good! Thank you people for dragging me out into the big wild world! Uhuh, let's just say that I'm drunk, it's easier that way! *mind you, if i was drunk i could probably actually speel* Ahh, that's the life.

I think I'll drag my friends with me ... hehe. He's drinking mate de coca which is cocaine leaves! Apparantly it helps with the aclimitisation *don't worry, I checked it, it's right.* But in Peru it's winter at the moment, *muhahaaa it's boiling here!* and the sun sets at 6! Aww, so it's actually quite cold, and seeing as he's near Lake Titicaca, which is the highest lake in the world, it'll be freezing! I have to go sooory...

      Ahh I keep having freaky dreams! (Do you want to know what's inside my head? I don't, it's too scary! *runs away*) ... ... Anyway! It all started one dark evening *...* Ok, so I was walking down this road with some people when I head this person scream "AMY NOOOOO!" and then I turned and saw a car run someone over, then there was a sound like someone hitting a football and the persons head flew off near to us. Then everyone started crying and saying "Amy's dead!" But when I looked at the face, I didn't recognise it, but I should have *I think it was my face!* so I started crying anyway. Oh, and the voice that shouted "AMY NOOOO!" was Amy... freaky huh? Ok... so maybe no one wanted to know at all! It's just too freaky! Get it away! Nooo! Then I had another dream where I was horrible and everyone was swearing at me and telling me to go away, so I asked someone "Am Ireally that horrible?" but I woke up before I got a reply! (I don't think I would have wanted to know anyway) Ummm anyway... I'll just be crawling away now to do homework...

      Heeeey I'm back *again, this is getting old now, isn't it?* Well anyway... London was sooo cool! I loved it! :D We saw Bombay Dreams! Which was really good, (ok so the plot was predictable and corny but hell, the music was good!) It's kind of one of these 'oh, this would be good for people who didn't know this moral lesson already'. It was one of the 'we can't be together' 'but i love you' things, you know? Good the first time, but predictable the next. Oooh, and what else did we do? Oh yeah, we saw Buffallo *how do you spell that!* Soldiers. It's probably the most depressing film that I've seen. Don't believe the reviews, they were calling it 'really funny' and 'like catch 22'. Catch 22 did not have all the gore and head screwy stuff that went on! It was a really sad.. and disturbing movie. Err, hell go blow yourself out if you want to watch it, but don't expect it to be funny! London is sooo amazing, it's full of loads and loads of different cultures, religions, languages! One day I heard Spanish, Italian, German, French, *and a whole load of languages that I couldn't even begin to understand (hindi), Japanese, Chinese! I loved it! The diversity was just soooo good, I love that *compared to Nailsea it's heaven*. Err also we went to Notting Hill, *there was a cool market* and I got this cool pathwork silk skirt for £5! Hehe I'm gonna love freaking people out with it... not that it's not cool... *hehe* Ahh I have fun wearing whatever I want in Nailsea *it has to be the most boring place in the whole world!!!*

I probably killed a small gathering of trees in maths today. ... ... Okay, so I destroyed a whole forest trying to work out what was going on!

      Yeay for not shaving legs! (Seriously considering taking sociology next year.) Then you can learn how shitty our whole society is! Wohooo! *Stupid globalisation* Hmm... but is it better than anarchy though? In Russia one of my friends was trying to convinse me that anarchism is good... we have a big argument, fun! Anarchy is based on the idea that people don't go out and kill, rape, steal. Let's face it, if that didn't work for the Vikings, Stone age people etc. why's it gonna work now? And how come we've evolved to be like this, a non-anarchy society. I don't wanna devolise! From human to fish... nasty.

      Ahh sorry guys... I'm so clumsy, I lost the post! Yup, clever but clumsy. *sometimes people get those mixed up* I hate being clumsy though! One mistake and things can go wrong, the repercusions. Don't worry, I try at school, but at home I let it all hang out. Sadly, I end up walking into door frames because of this slight 'technical error' - arms mainly, they're annoying. Mmm... slightly ever so slightly changing the subject... don't you just love hearing about other people's trails of thought? Like how you get from crackers to elephants. Err, actually that would be quite hard! I'd probably do crackers - wallace + gromet - moon - cheese - mouse - elephant. Watching tv. Bratz adverts. Feel like killing makers of Barbie. Damn stereotyped ultimate women - big boobs, completely ditzy and 'available'. Real ultimate women - friendly, lovable, UGLY! Who care if you've got a texan zit on your eye! I hate this stupid programme on Sky 1 *don't worry, it's american* about this women trying to find her ultimate date, by meeting them, but they've got masks on, and her they unmasking her 'chosen one' (yup, it's star warrrs!) then if he's ugly, dumping him. *breathhheeee...* How damn stupid is that! If I find my ultimate man to be 'ugly' I think I might kick everyones stereotyped backsides and burn every diet book, and glossy magasine in sight! Infact... I'm gonna do it anyway! Death to Barbie! *note to self: search for anti-barbie website. not to self: join it.*

At least I haven't got the freaky eye thing when you can't concentrate on anything and your eyes wonder everywhere! Yeah, I freak people out when I do that and try to talk to them! *but the walls are sooo interesting!* Ahh I need a new head... *optional donations of pink matter are ... optional* If you had a chance to 'choose' your kid, then would you? Wouldn't that be like expecting them to be like something without even knowing them, I would hate to live in that society! Every one would expect you to look pretty and get good grades, they'd expect that from everyone. And what if because of your environment you were a failure? Would your parents have a right to blame you and punish you? Ahh, don't you just hate 'the west' sometimes too?

My words can be compressed! I don't really waffle on and on, do I? (Mmm waffles.) Ahh... just thinking about life I guess. It's never easy is it? There is no multiple choice answer... there's always consequences to unseen actions. It's never black and white because black is white, and white is black. (Hah! Got em confused! Now to add a clever 'money saving' offer... muahhaaa) *sigh, just when you thought I had brains* Hehe, I like to keep them hidden though, everyone thinks differently of you if you don't. Ahh! Look Around You is on DVD! Who wants to get it for me first? :P I will... I will... I have to fuel my brain with more randomness! It's kind of nice to think that other people get your humour. And annoying when people don't get when you're not being serious *i'm sure that gets everyone else into trouble as well* Gary Jules - Mad World.

It wouldn't work having a world of pacifists, because then idiotic villians would take power. When it comes down to it, the only thing that will get you power is money and violence. Ha, what a great view on the world. I suppose there are people that do good, but there is always an opposition to them, so do they cause that opposition? Wooh. Getting a bit too confusing now. (My mum's reading about quantum physics, and evolution, I guess I get it from her!)

      Wow! I went flying today, I went once in the morning and then the people for this afternoon didnt show up so I went up again.  I can  now loop the loop and do a barral roll!!!  I also watched Top Gun.  Its such a good film: fast planes, one fast bike and 1 rather young and hot looking Tom Cruise. You will be forced to watch it at somepoint!!  Hee hee!!! Its very good.  xx

       urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/experiment.shtml  They did this for real. Gave some guys some weapons and 'authority' and the others chains. What happened? Human nature? The guys acting as the 'police men' started acting violently towards the 'prisoners' and the experiment had to be  stopped. Apparantly there was an experiment where people were told to listen to people answering questions, and press 'yes' or 'no' according to the answer that they gave. If they pressed no, then they would hear screaming, as if the person had been given an electric shock. But the person in the white coat behind them told them that it was ok, so they kept going, until the screams stopped. Human nature? Or the corruptive effect of power?

      Hmm... should we mean what we say and not say what we mean? I can't remember what way around that goes! It's scary that people don't mean what they say... I know that people do, but does that mean that we should question everything they say and the value of their words? (Yup, about four years of thinking) Ahh... it's scary. Our world's so capitalist. People just want your money. Apparantly it's fine to screw the third world, so long as we benefit. But what if we were born differently. What about the third world? Yeah, they might be poor, but that's through no fault of their own. They could be the next superstar if they were given the chance. I'm willing to bet that if they were where I am they wouldn't be sitting around, they'd be grabbing every oportunity, because they know what it's like to have none. Is life too easy for us? All we have to do is selfishly go to McDonald's, paying 99p for food that's destroying the world around us. Just think for a second, what did they have to do to get the price to 99p? How many people did they rip off? We have the money to pay for fair trade, yet we selfishly keep it to ourselves. All because we were born here. What rights should we have because of birth place? Because of a fusion of egg and sperm we are somehow viewed differently by society and have more prospects. In this world money is all that matters. Only people who have too much of it do good with it. Why do we refuse to spread money equally, giving everyone a fair chance to eat and grow? Why do people die from obseity when others die from famine? Why can't I stop it?

I'm feeling better, but I'm free from school cause of holidays, so I'll be running around like an idiot anyway *ah well* Actually, I think I'll act dead for a few days, then go on a hyper sugar streak of activity *mostly running around buying chocolate bananas* Mmm... random. Heeey that would be lush! Chocolate bananas! And... and... strawberry cheese! Wow, I should totally become some one in the food industry! 'You don't need to diet when you've got Katie's TM R PQC food near you' Muhaha.... dieting fools, I shall rule the world!

I've got a bad cold. :( And instead of going in and spreading it, I thought I might stay at home. (Aww, aren't I nice) Yup, that would also explaint he weird lack of mood I'm in... you know... where you don't really know what your feeling? Angry and sad are easy emotions to know, they camp out at my house  sometimes. Mmm... I really want an ice cream cone covered in chocolate... anyone offering to get me one?

Oh wait... YAAARGHHH! And yes, I'm board. WOOHOO! It's ... Tuesday ... Did anything interesting ever happen on Tuesday?

(or was it yesterday?) *that's not the point!* It was another of our schools 'we should be christians, let god come and clean his finger nails with you' thing. Why do we have to do so much christianity in RE, yeah sure it's the national religion, but what about all the other religions? I've had about 11 years of christianity! Aaahhh! I think I'll stick with being an atheist thank you very much. Now take your lemon and leave!

      I WILL STAND IN THEIR WAY! Get that egg head out of there! Ahh I love the conservative party... they really inspire me to go against them all the way! You see... I am more of a communist than George Bush's IQ score. (Which could make me very conservative.) Empathy for all! I hate the whole right's view of 'bugger everyone else I'm getting out of here' it's closer to anarchy than my blue socks. (Yup, it's a random day) Doesn't everyone just love my words of advice? (Don't you mean commands of acceptance) Well... maybe... Ahh but I've decided that if the Conservative party becomes the next goverment or if the BNP get any seats I'm moving to Cuba. And I'm taking my cats with me! Actually... I think I might leave them in Britain and infect some pain on the people. MUHAHAHAAA! Nah... I couldn't live without them! I'm gonna kidnap them and hide in my flat when I go to London. Actually... I think my parents will willingly throw them at me when I go! They're so cute, but no thanks to the load of dead animals! Ahh, not that I can't handle dead things, but it's just kind of waste. I bet they're causing an extinction in rare birds near us or something like that. I LOOOOVE MY CATS!

Lynne, i cna think of many people who wud love to see the back of ian at cdts. Me, my brother, matt, kristian, mike, carrie.... and the list goes on.... face it he is annoying everyone but you. and he is bullying me, bullying means anything that is insulting, rude or abusive be it mental, physical or verbal. He is always insulting me and being rude and calling me names, he tried to spit in my ear the other nite, and he constantly treads on my feet, trips me up and he tried to knock me off my chair the other day. Thats verbal and physical already. and mental, well, he is driving me the afore mentioned. No one likes him. there. thats betta. c ya 2moz xoxox

Why D? D for deranged, D for different, D for Dennis. Eventually, after about one hour in the Clarke's shop, and about five different people.... I HAVE SHOOOOES! Now all I need is socks, pants, a top and trousers and I'm fit to live in this world. I may have killed five slave labour children who were hurt when the shoes fell on them and killed them, but I finally have some. Hmm... on Sex in the City they have this whole shoe shopping fetish that goes on... *dramatic sigh... kind of like huh but more like oohioha* If only they sold stuff for big footed people *my bro's a size 13* Now that's manic!

      u r sooooo weird lynne! this blogger is really stupid. it still ain't working properly, its showing blogs that u 2 have put but not the ones that i have written which gets me very confused as i have a memory like a seive and can never remember whether i have already written a blog today or not. I was online earlier i no that, and so were u lynne but u bugarred off as soon as i signed in *highly suspicious if u ask me considering u probably knew i was gonna pester u about what was going on in the quad yeaterday* actually thats a point, what was going on, i tried to get izzy and pete to talk, but no amount of tickle torture seemed to work *just kidding*. have finished my forever friends x-stitch, and am now starting a geisha *for those of you whose cultural knowledge is lacking, a geisha is basically a chinese/japanese (can never remember which) lady* It is so cool! but quite hard. it is my present for agreeing to go thru with the needle. my trousers should be coming on tues or weds so i will wear them when they get here. I am sooo glad the hardest exam is over first, but i am beginning to doubt the difficulty of the paper, of course, i am talking about maths non-calculator. rite am gonna stop wittering now. xoxoxox

      It's undeaded now *the blog works yippieee!* Well... kind of! We now have mocks, which include two weeks study leave, which includes the mocks. So basically, we're doing tests one every day with breaks. No time to relax kiddo, this is study hell. Ahh, so I might come on later in the week, and if I'm acting drunk, I won't be *i hope* I'll just be stressed. Actually, I might be drugged up on herbal medicene. No really, this is herbalist stuff. (or mate de coca... hmm, tough choice)

      Ahh... slightly been neglecting this! Sorry! Just been kind of lonely, which makes a bored non bothering me. Woohoo! Also, I've been wondering what the deal is with the obsession that teenage mags have with people farting? Seriously! *no, seriously* It's really quite weird, and it's not like you can not fart! (Hands up who've tried) Yeay, now I'm talking about farts and you've freaked out yourself / the neighbours / your goldfish! Woohoo! Yes, I really can get around to talking about anything. Ahh, but I've mellowed out a bit, which isn't good! (Hmm...) Other excuses: I was eaten by aliens. I am an alien. The dog ate it. (Wait a sec, I don't have a dog!) Noooo! Ah, I could try my brother ate it, he tried to eat my English book once! Ah, actual excuse: I've got mocks next week! AAAHHHH! These are mocks, not mock mocks, which makes them confusingly kind of important *i'm gonna wing it like i always do* Yeay! Oh, and I've got... wait a sec, new excuse... I've got a concert today! I get to HIT a BASS DRUM! Now, that's something to be proud of! It is kind of hard though, you have to count the bars, and when you end up going 43 2 3 4 44 2 3 4 you get  a bit lost! I'm always one beat out! *oops* Yup, I mess up the whole thing, YEAY! Ahh it'll be fine though, like everything else *ignorance is bliss*

      katie, ur def gonna be a homocidal illiterate maniac, it suits u to a t (what that saying means!!!). i don't think i'll be gettin food while i'm there, unless i beg and plead and say its part of some sort of coursework that we have to try some sort of local cuisine!!!!!! i don't normally mind hospitals as long as it doesn't involve needles or long waits (like yesterdays long wait). i can't believe its three weeks and 4 days. (its on monday 15th dec for u deaf people who can't hear ranting about it at school!) its the last monday of term, and i wont be in for most of that week but hopefully i'll make it in for the last day. yay, we have a non school uniform day on friday, i need to find out what everyone is wearing *just so we dont have a repeat of what happened with me and emma during our yr 10 exams*. I have wearing my jeans, a black top of some sort (depends which one i feel like wearing) and my bright blue hooded fleece. katie please wear ur cool knitted top, if not give it to me!!!! *and i'll conveniently forget to give it back to you for the next 20 years!*  aaah... for the days when i was young and carefree and could wear wot i wanted with out some one saying something and being a bitch!!! I take u are coming to claire's suprise party that isn't a suprise party, if dan can persuade his parents!!! it was originally dan's idea and then we both made a guest list, and claire was sat between us with out a say in the matter. ne way must stop ranting and ranting and ooooo.......... sorry went off into a world of me own then (you dont wanna know what i was thinking). rite. rite. rite. erm. bye xoxox

      Aww Laura!!! Poor youuu! I hate hospitals, but apparantly the eye hospital has good food! *Yeah right, like that can ever happen!* Oh, Mr Linnet/Linnit/Linnitt is back! *AAAHHH!* He was on paternity leave, which is really cool! Fathers should get time to spend with their new kids! Dad's don't get to see enough of their kids! *Ahh it's a pro-dad thing!* Yes, when I'm older I'm gonna... not be a dad. Sadly, I think at most I'm gonna be a mum *sigh*. Yeesh that was scary to say! Nah, I'm more likely to be a homocidal iliterate maniac! *Yeay!* Aww, and they don't give careers advice on it!

YES!!!!  wot did i miss at school today?! Has mr linnitt taken down that stupid dragonfly yet and does he want our coursework in now cos i think i may have lost all the graphs!!! o well, how was biology katie? lynne, how was media? and of course i can't ask claire how was maths and english but i'll say it anyway!!! i did a quick iq test thing the other day and i think my iq was something around 145/150 but i can't remember. was quite amazing actually. c ya 2 moz xoxox

      ...What's up with my pc? It's finally found out that there's more to the internet than it thought. It's suddenly found the backrounds for pages and annoying little extras like that that it's been missing. Maybe it just got lonely. Ahh, some nice person probably came and fixed it during the night *aren't burgulars nice?* Oh, about my last post. Sorry, but d. was probably a sane answer! I mean, who wouldn't beat up margret thatcher? Who actually wears blue on the day of the elections? *apart from the poor little dogs that ian duncan smith has employed to help promote the conservative party by making them wear blue poncho's* Ahh, but it's not him anymore is it? It's that vampire guy... Michael... Howard? *if he's a childrens tv presenter, sorry!* On the topic of politics...  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/031115/325/ee1zu.html  Only one in three think that George Bush is stupid?!

      katie, u've been ranting again!!! the body shop party was sooo kool. i can't believe how much money we spent *tho i don't think it matches the bill we rang up for all the food we ate when we went to St Caths for Drugs Awareness eh Lynne?* ne one no where i can get a cheap t.v. that hasn't been stolen, broken, hidden cameraed (?), etc.... me and my sis want one for christmas but we don't want to have to spend more than £50 pounds between us. (other wise most of our money will be gone) in answer to that test question thing katie if i was doing the test i wud probs have to say (C)! thats sounds about normal for me.  I have missed cdts thisevening and am obviously having with drawal symptoms as i have spent the whole evening doing h/w *so what if it was fun, cos it was txtiles, its not rite to spend the whole evening doing it!* rite g2g, will blab more tomorrow during Media!!!!!!!!! xoxox

      Heeey... I feel like some random violence. Anyone seen my mob? *Hey GUYS! Over here!* Nothing quite like some random violence to kick someone's credit card up the ass. (Don't worry, it'll be fair trade anti-globalist violence, nothing too drastic) *or sanatising* Hmm... sanatising... weird word. I mean it in the sanity way. (I wonder if I'd pass a shrink test?) I honestly think that no one would! We're just lucky cause no one's asked us to take it yet! *muhahaaa fools!* Uhh well not it my present state of mind. Actually... they'd probably put test questions on like: An old lady comes up to you in the street. Is she... a. following you with her rabies infested dog. b. brandishing a knife behind her back. c. not there, you're hallucinating again. d. margret *damn i'm proud at not being able to spell that!* thatcher and you're about to do some bodily harm to her because of it. e. asking what street this is so she can call the cops to come and get you. f. you're mum with your pills.  And... the catch-22 is... there are no sane results! Horrar!

Ahh tomorrow I made a pact to ...er ... what was it? Not talk about my cats and spinsterhood ;P and Izzy has to not talk about Pete (her bfg) and Emma has to not talk about her hair!

Mostly: get fit, but I guess I'll actually stick to that one when I get nearer to going to Kygrystan! *i think that's how it's spelt...* I didn't tell you I was going? Well it's in 2005, but it costs £3000! Eek! That's a lot of money! So I've been bag packing like crazy!!! Ahhh! Haa it's going to be soooo fun though! Who cares if we don't wash for a month! We'll all stink so nobody's gonna notice! Well actually... I think the people on the plane back might notice! Oh well, their loss. Oh I'm having people staying over the night New Years Eve... err sorry peeps but I invited so many people that I don't know if there's gonna be room for everyone! I guess I'll just sleep in the rabbit run, Lynne can have the rabbit hutch and Laura can go in the garage.

Come back brain, return to me! I watched the Return of The King yesterday! I can't believe they cut out Sauroman.. or whoever the bad guy dressed in white was. I want to watch the extended one, even if it's five hours it will still be amazing!

FREEDOM!!

AAAAGGGGHHHH! for the first time in my life i feel short! was reminded this christams of all the people from chessington and all the m8's i left behind. (Ben, Katharine, Sarah, Vivki, Katie, Adam, etc,etc). good piece of advice; never agree to move house, unless u are staying in the same town! what brought all this on was the crimbo letter we got from denise (bens mum), we always get one cos me and ben and liam were quite close (cos ben was 10 days older than me), we always shared parties etc and my mum and his mum were good friends so every year we get a Scorer update letter ! it seems strange to be part of someones life when you live soo very far away! we haven't been on the relative trail yet but when we do go there are gifts waiting for us! YAY! i really wanna get more pressies and more money and more more more!!! *mmm....slight power mad moment there!* right must shut up, i always end up writing tonnes, i could sit here and type for hours, of course i wud probably repeat myself a couple of times!! and for those of u who r dumb enuf to have not worked out y i am excited, its becos i get to c tim sometime in the near future!!

Grandma phoned up and sed that i could put it on my dressing table, two difficulties with that 1) what is a dressing table and 2) I dont own one!!!!

THEY  ARE BOTH GORGEOUS NOW LEAVE IT AT THAT!!!!!! good news. i am meeting up with tim at some stage, whenever we can both get to the mall, cos we worked out on christmas eve (despite the fact that he'd had about 10 cans and had been playing drinking games, and i had had a couple of drinks) that the mall is the mid point more-or-less between us. YAY! i got chased by the ducks at backwell lake on christmas day. i had bread and of course no one had been there so none of them had been fed, so the chased me (or followed, either way) 1/2 way round the lake, and it was geese and swans aswell which i am totally scared of cos they try to eat me! wot else has happened, my eye is alot better. my auntie got engaged christmas day, i am very happy for no apparant reason, and i have lots of money that i can spend or save and gain interest on! okay i think that is it so i will stop blabbering on and on and on.......................... bye xoxoxoxoxox

       urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/031222/80/ehobi.html  - 'Loose screw halts nuclear power station' I would hate to be living in Spain right now! *hell, actually i wouldn't care if there was a nuclear melt down if i was living in spain!' Mmm... might make the pina colada taste funny though. Anyway... oh wait, I still don't have a point. Paragraph spree! I slept for five hours so I'm less sleep deprived *or derived?* but still totally crazy! Heeey I was wondering *uhoh* when people are the opposite of you does that mean that you shouldn't get along? (in english-more likely to not get along) *spell check on opposite... bing correct* I used to think that everyone could be friends with everyone else, but it's truer if you say everyone can tolerate everyone else, but then that's not always true! Ahh, but you might as well try. Anyway, I should probably stop pretending that I know something... and that my brain's not just a pile of grey goo. *hey, mine's probably grey goo with pink strips!* Mmm brains...

      Wahay, got about three hours of sleep last night. *izzy's sleepover party* It got quite dangerous; at 4 in the morning we were trying to play clever word rule games *very very dangerous* but everyone kept forgetting what they were supposed to be doing! Sadly the stripper failed to turn up for izzy's party, but we've got johnny depp booked for next year and hopefully he should actually turn up! Yup, that's sleep deprevation kicking in! It was fun though! I had a sudden impulsive urge to watch Muppet Treasure Island but izzy didn't have it so we watched the Christmas one. Then we all had a foot war *so fun!* you have to err... whack the person with your foot... to win. Yup, absolute crap. Well, seeing as this room is getting dark, I'll go and lie down in a different one.

      Let me set the scene... this is after one of the FBI guys got up, and figured that he was sitting on the hole where Saddam was...  FBI1       : Go on, Mr Hussein, Sir.  Tell us where you put the weapons. Saddam : I have no weapons, you Western Infidel.  FBI1        : Yes you do.  We sold them to you in the 1980's.  Look, here's the receipt.  Kurdish Gas, Botulism spray, Meaballs in gravy.  It's all here.  Saddam    : I take them back to Argos and get refund.  14 day return policy.  Not suitable for purpose.  Bracket missing from self-assembly ICBM missile.  Meatballs particularly unpleasant.  I get vouchers and buy DVD player and free Bruce Willis box set.  Top Banana!  *aahhh, so much better than my one!* Hey, I've been having a stressful time from the tests, and now I'm freeeee! *wahoo!* Anyway, this was done by Vegan Shoe a.k.a. Dado Rail a.k.a. Ian. Personally I think he should have mentioned peas at least once *mine was better!* (was not, fool!) :P Anyway, let's all be thankful that they shoved Bush down the hole after they got Saddam out. :D

      About the whole Saddam Hussein thing. They're illegally going to try him, not in a court of world affairs, but with a bias court set up by the Americans. I hate this only because it enabilises the pro-Saddam supporters to condemn the Americans for not giving him a fair trial. It gives them something to fight for, and to become martyrs for. Did all these people come from Harvard who arranged this? Pumped full of American goo? About the whole WMD thing. Can't you imagine the Simpsons doing a take off of them questioning him. Scary Guy FBI Agent Number 1: Okay Saddam, tell us where the WMD's are Saddam: No. SCFAN1: We know you've got them somewhere! Saddam: You can't prove that! SCFAN1: Err... go on... Wait a sec they're behind you! Saddam: ... SCFAn1: Pretty please? Saddam: Hey, I hid all the money so that I could get a good lawyer, go away! ...

I only 'knew' a few people, but I 'knew by sight' everyone else. Me and Izzy ended up with a bottle of red wine between us, and someone thought I was 19! *muhahahaaa evil plans forming* It's very dangerous to tell a fifteen year old kid that you think they look eighteen! *dam, must be my new hair style! aaargh everyone thinks it's permed!* Whenever I get my hair cut I always look older! *so if i get it shaved, i'll look 50 and get away with absolutly anything* Yeay!

      "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him." Not some cleverly thought out historical speech but something that seems like it should have come from a soap opera or a games show. Months of searching in an illegal war that has killed more during the illegal occupation than the hostile invasion did. Not that I'm saying it was wrong.

Maybe they've realised that I'm not a man that needs to take viagra! *for gods sake, don't go on this if you search for viagra!* Anyway... onto things that won't get me tagged by the CIA search engine... Crap, probably already am for including CIA in this. Good luck with your operation! Hopefully the surgeons won't have hang overs! *eh?* Naaah, I'm sure it'll go fine! Well, I hope it will!

      You know you're in trouble when... you sing along to Goo Goo Dolls - Iris with your eyes closed. Not as random as you think! We were in a science test and this girl was singing Killing Me Softly sooo badly! So if I fail science I'm blaming her. *or maybe i should blame my cat for distracting me all the time by sitting on my revision books* Mmm... random cheesy 80s love songs are getting onto my pc. *aaah!* Aww, but weren't Wet Wet Wet cool? *...* I wonder what they're all doing? Living off their one hit wonders? I would be! Probably ended up playing in bingo halls for 80 year old ladies who are deaf anyway. Nice.

      Do you ever get those 'aaahhh now i get it' moments? I seem to be having a lot of those recently. Only one problem. It's my subconscious figuring it out, so all of a sudden I'm wondering what it is I've figured out. It takes a few days to reach my conscious mind. More like a week. Which isn't good when you're in a test. I think my subconsious mind and conscious mind need to mix more! Hmm... wonder when someone figured that you had a subconsious mind and a conscious mind? *see! it takes a paragraph of dribble to get clever intelligence!*

Gyaaaahhh! *played too much FF10* The English today was slightly bearable *you wouldn't guess it from reading my spelling though* It's one of those subjects that I'm apparantly good at... actually, more like everyone else is really really crap at it so I look good. *sorry, but it feels more like that!* I think they should supply us with batons made of foam so that we can hit the desk/supervising person when we get stressed in the exams. Or at least supply us with mittens or something! I think my hands might drop off in a test someday now. *fun!* Free my pretties! FREEE!

How are you supposed to do a french exam without a dictionary? It's as close to impossible you can get without us not having to do it. (Exams really affect my communication) Talking to a revision book all day gets to you I guess. At least we've only got English tomorrow! Ahh, nah, I'm not actually that worried. (I think) Some how I'll fluke my way through it! Yeay!

(or gullable I guess) Ahh I'm not really a 500 pound gorilla! I'm a 30 stone teapot! Hmm not many job opertunities open to me then I guess. We got all out GCSE predicted you're gonna get this grade or your conscience will kill you grades back and I did ok! Yeaaay! Only two grades to up and then I'm gonna be an aaa student! Woohoo! Mind you a baaa student would be quite cool. (Probably end up being a baaab) Then onto AS and A2 levels! (Gyaahhh!) I did some Japenese drumming today! Cool man! It was soooo much fun but I forgot the name of the cool group who are performing in England and are 'world class'. We also did some gamelan, which is also loads of fun! Ahh but I wanted to play the gong! The Japanese drummer guy came in and started hitting the gongs (shows what he loves!) Gamelan:  urlLink http://www.joglosemar.co.id/gamelan.html  I was playing a saron! I love all these other culture things, I wish I could join a group or something...

Oooh, I went to a yoga class! *this last time i chose to do exercise was when i did ballet in year 5* Hehe... so as you can guess I was the one at the back of the glass who cheered when the lady said 'don't do this if you feel that you can't'. Yes, once again Britain's youth is up shown by the older generation who were happily snapping their back in two. *don't worry, Laura came with me and she was the one doing the back bending* Also, our friend Dave fractured his skull! :( He was playing football and somehow ran into a wall!

      Hummmmmmm.........Jenny and I were talking about the ghost busters music yesterday.  I came up with the fantastic suggestion of watching the Ghostbusters Video that Katie has and listening to the music repetativly, untill u can copy it.  That way all u have to pay is Katie for all the food you eat, and Katie's parents have to pay the electric bill. Sorted!!! I've been having a fun day, went down the cdt sqd this afternoon and did some demolishing, and moving and binning.  I did media this morning, and have been talking to Ian on the phone, what a fun day.  OOOOOOOOO I dislike this haily weather, it hurts your head!!! xx

      Geez, I'm actually using hair products. :( After all these years of screaming if I walked into the hair spray section... *sigh* But it's just mousse! *nope, can't spell* and hair serum! *Now it sounds like I put an animal and human sweat on my hair* Well I don't know! *crazy day* But that's so that I don't have to brush it or bother with it *muhahahaaa* So actually I'm bothering so that I don't have to bother! On to things that are slightly more interesting *this is our first meeting, I don't want to go too far* Does anyone know where you can buy the Ghost Busters sheet music from? Ahh ebay search! *random music plays in the backround as you edge towards the exit* I'm just bored. There's only so much enjoyment you can get out of singing along with Roy Orbison. WOWWWW! You can BUY the GHOSTBUSTERS PROTON PACKS!!! My god, I've been living in the dark for so long! *needs to get the courage to use mIRC or find a dark chat room*

      Hello.......... I have my dress!!!! YAYAYAYAYAY!!!  Its purple and nice and purple.... ummmmmm sorry got lost in it there then.  But I musnt forget its a dress, ughhhh, I dont do dresses.  I really wish that people would not buy me smarties, one pack is fine but 4, im talking tubes here, is a bit excessive.  Hummm........ jess jenny Anna and I put all the fotos for the year buk that we had onto a cd today, great fun!!!  Then we had a little disco in Jess' room, twas fun!!  Ummm i had another message but have forgotten it.... nope I haven't actually.  katie i would not add more hours onto the Bill, because I no longer watch it.  I don't know what I would do, actually yes i do I would save up all the time and stick it onto the weekend, so that i diddnt have to go to school for longer.  Or I would give myself more time asleep because I'm nearly always tired!!! xx

      Ahhh! Life's just too confusing! How are you supposed to fit all the things that you want to do into one day? I recon a day should be at least 5 hours longer! *ahh more time asleep :)* Actually... probably more time drinking! *i mean non-alcoholic* I just like drinking more than eating... yup totally bizarre. Apart from tea's, what satisfaction can you get from drinking tea? Well I guess that's a really dumb idea... geez instead of using it to cure a disease or save a life I would be drinking cranberry juice *sigh* Actually... Lynne would probably add an extra hours onto the Bill and Laura would probably have five hours for break time! So I guess it's not that weird. *phew, got out of that one* Anyway I gotta go shopping in Bristol! Bibi.

      Bonjour!!!  Laura why dont you have your birthday party on Sunday the 15th of Feb.  That way the loved up couples can be loved up and go to your party, I can't but, hey I might be with some fit guys!!!  Letty and I learnt a new word last, night, its rather rude but very funny, and I cant even remember how its spellt, but no doubt it will come up in a media studies lesson.  My mother and Father are out for lunch at some of our neighbours houses with the rest of the neighbours, which means I could either stay at home and be a little bored and look after my sister or I could go and die of bordem, I went for the first option. Glad you had fun yesterday Laura, i am ill and am not venturing out of the house to much. I agree with you Kes about the whole New years resolution spice grils thing, at least I do up until the next time we all get together and party a bit to hard, or not as the case may be.  xx

      aaaaaaaah i saw katie and izzy in bristol!!!! aaaaaaahhh!!!! But we had a good time, me anna, and tim. we did some shopping, and i bought the evanescence album, and then we did more shopping and then we had lunch, bought some sweets and went to the cinema and saw the new Peter Pan film *which isn't actually half as crap as it looks!* then we did more shopping and then we came home *sob* we had a good time tho. rite, i need ur help............wot shall i do for my birthday and when? cos i can't do it the saturday after my bday bcos those who r delightfully attatched (izzy, samantha.....) will want to be with their other halves that day bcos it is valentines day, sop that day is out of the question. and i can't have it the weekend b4 bcos then u'll have samanthas party one week and mine the next and i'll end up getting really crappy pressies cos none of u will have any money. So, i'm a bit bugared. I'm actually starting to think that maybe i shud just forget about my bday this year. *tho i dont think thats quite as easy as it sounds*. rite im blabbering again so im gonna shut up *again*. bye bye, c ya nice and early in skool tomorrow! xoxoxox

Woohooo! The most expensive thing about the ensemble is the bag! Izzy also got a really nice dress! Yup, we danced to Spice Girls and sang along.

      Wow, brad pitt is sooooo gorgey!!!  Was reading about him in the paper, why do some men have to me absolutly drop dead gorgeous and then others, mainly all the ones we happen to know are ugly as wotsits!!!! Ummmmmmmmmm...... U really should ban me from talking about men again, it should shut me up for a while.  I really like pink Jelly Babies, in small amounts they are really very nice.  Sorry I am sat here with a bag of jelly babies and there is only one left, a black one, which I strongly dislike!!  Poor old Jess, she is ill with a cold like the rest of the nation.  OOOO it snowed over night, yes the snow was slightly pathetic, but it still snowed!!!!  Yay the first snow of winter, wasn't that a name of some really bad film??  Lalala i'm rediculously mad.  I really hate shopping for dresses.  Im sure you have all seen what women want, well when I go shopping with my dad its like shopping with mel Gibsons character, he wants you to have a dress that makes you look like a nun!!!  Or an old lady.  I really don't ware dresses.  Have you seen me in a dress in the last 5 years?  NO!!!! Ahhhhhhhhh I hate them they are soooo ugggghhhhhhh.  Right rant over, o I hate shoes with heels to, I really cant walk in them, they make me fall over to much.  Ummmmmmm I really need chocolate and Coldplay, ooooo coldplay. Did you have a nice time with Tim laura, I was going to text you during today but I keep on forgetting and I expect your coming home now or something.  O well. I'm all alone, dad and nicole are with the caravan cleaning it and Mum is at nans, at least I think she is.   When I go sking my loverly family are all going to London, and France I think without me.  But muuuhahahahahah *evil laugh* they wont be able to get a family ticket for anything, because they are all based on two adults and two children, I know these things, don't ask me why.   Hummmmmmm had better go and do something constructive, but then again what is constructive, this could be said to be constructive as I am entertaining millions *cough*!!! That is a very interesting thought!! xx

Hummm i'm not to sure about sleeping in the rabbit hutch, as much as i love your rabbit Katie, I really dont think me and her would fit in it!!!  Sorry about waking you all up, Jenny should really learn to keep her phone turned off!! I think she is a bit annoyed with me becasue she wont return any of my texts!!!   I made three new year resolutions originally, but then forgot one so I know have two; 1) to do well in my gcse's and 2) to get a guy and keep hold of him, cos you neva no when u mite need 1!!!! laura are you looking forward to seeing Tim, you will have to fill me in on all the goss!!! Humm had better go jess stocks email is working again so have to email her, all before eastenders starts. xx P.S Jonny Depp rules!!

      i didn't go in the garage tho did i?! and we all fitted into the front room (altho ur dad did have to try and navigate his way thru in the morning!)that was sooo much fun last nite.  my mum and dad didn't care about the amount of alcohol i drank, in fact their actually encouraging me to have more thisevening, bcos where we bought it all for crimbo adn then most of us weren't 100% we still have quite a bit left, so i get to drink as much as i like. but even if they didn't like me drinking, i have a perfectly good excuse to; my new years resolution (not really a resolution but anyway...) is to put at least 1/2 a stone by my bday, which means i would then be about 9 stone *amazing how someone of my build can weigh soo much!* just had to do a whole paper round rather than the normal half a round that i do cos my bro did my half yesterday so that i cu go and see LOTR so i had to do his half today. Am now extremely nackered *which wud explain the crap that i'm typing* LYNNE! Dont u eva do that to us again, u woke up more or less everyone thismorning txting jenny, we managed to go back to sleep but we were not best part pleased when we woke up and found out that it had been jenny's fone beeping bcos u had txt her despite the fact that u must have known that we wud still be asleep bcos we had been up late (4 o'clock to be precise). We were playing dance mat at 2am.  anyway gonna shut up. *someone tell me y i always end up saying that......*xoxoxoxox

      It's snowing! It's actually snowing in Bristol! And it only took ten years for it to properly snow again! Yes, I have frolicked in the snow, but I'm still really excited and hyper! Woohooo! And yes, I have walked through it until I got caked. Nothing can stop my hyper happeeeness! Ahh well some things will... but I won't let them happen! (Everyone has to not say anything now!) I loooove snow though... I wonder where this obsession came from? Oh god, not another obsession! Also I'm becoming obsessed with polar bears although I think that has something to do with giving up chocolates and sweets for lent. That big shock to my system has to have affected it a lot! I keep forgetting as well and going to eat chocolate, it hasn't reached my conscious yet but then some things never do. Ahh well guess I'll have to wait another ten years for it to snow again. Might as well go roll around in it.

Worth a try, but nothing's gonna save us. Woohoo for monotonous living! Actually... it's crap, but nevermind my life changes but working life seems to ...not. I think I'm just gonna have to buy a pair of tye dye thongs from Izzy and wear them over my trousers. No one would notice though, for me wierd is normal. Ahhhh! Anyway, stuff has happened. Like... I've become friends with one of my brothers friends so he's kind of 'warning' me not to be, and destroying a picture of the guy he sent to me. Hehe, tis quite funny really. Apart from the whole locking the front door, not letting me out thing. Ah well.

      katie, to get round this whole I need love thing wot you do is get one of your friends, for example Laura and tell her that you love her (in a friendly non lessie way) and then she tells you da same back, and you realise that really u dont need guys, as friends really do love you and are there through thick and thin because of the love they have for you, guys are just a different kettle of fish all together.   Anna and I tried it in a very boring German lesson the other day and we felt lots better, then we had to list good things about ourselves.  Basically we all need to be pro me (or pro yourself, wotever way you look at it, its the same!!)  This could well be my last blog before I go skiing so, adios amegoes and Happy Valentines day, love you both lots!!  See you when I get back. Mwah xx

Emma's got Ken... *sigh* Guess I'll just have to get Ken to set me up with a guy... *shiver* Hehe (So isn't thinking of sending Emma a valentines ecard from Ken) Yup... (Isn't checking out if they do them) AHHHH! Phew, breathe breathe. Geez the Barbie website's scary. It's like kids get brainwashed, like they're coming out of a factory pre-programmed to want to grow up, get married, have children, and die quietly. Nope, maybe not the life for me. I'm gonna die kicking and screaming! (Hopefully that won't be because someone's trying to strangle me)

I will change the world! It's my only aim in life. Who cares what your job is, if you haven't engraved yourself into a bit of the world then what's the point? Maybe that's where my passion is.

      Depress-ed. But not crack-ed. Need time to think-ed cause I thunk-ed but I can't think-ed. *thanks Edd!* Don't blame me, blame my state of mind. *crappy psychotherapy doesn't even help!* Just kidding! Boy, what I would do to get a psychiatrist. (Idiot, if you do anything you're gonna get one!) Maybe I should just become one and save this country some money.

Sorry, I've been reducing to shopping on the net cause I feel sicky and no one's here to throw up on! *mind you, if i was you reading this bright pink freak blog i think i would want to throw up on me* Go download some Jeff Buckley, you don't really need to resort to shoving fingers down your throat.

      Keeping secrets is important cos it emans that the person can trust you. I'll only ever tell some one else if i think it is really important that they no *like they've seen some ones boyf cheating on them or woteva*. Generally if I have a secret I tell everyone in due course anyway so there isnt really any reason for you lot to talk about me BEHIND MY BACK! but if i dont want everyone to no then i dont tell anyone. The first people that i alwas tell stuff are emily *cos i have a stupid number of lessons with her*, samantha and anna *cos they r my bessie mates* and robyn *pretty bloody obvious why*. God i am starting to sound old! gotta go, some people have just signed in! xxxxx *hugs and kisses*

      I guess what you keep a secret and what you keep a secret within a group are two different types *duh* The first one's more scary. I'm bad though, I tell everyone everything most of the time, and if I don't I just tell Laura and we sit down and go "God that's so bad" for about half an hour. But keeping something a secret only hurts other people. Let's face it, one person alone gives crap advice, stick two people onto them and suddenly they're the next Rikki Lake. And they're wearing spandex. *ahh!* But if someone's talking to you it means they want help, or if you're a pessimist and believe that your grandma's trying to kill you, you think they want attention. Whatever they want, just be there from them. And if they've shot me remember to tell the police.

I got paid yesterday! but they put tax on it when they arent supposed to but we r gonna claim back wot they took off which means i will get £248.something!!!!!!! to add to the £532 that i already have, but £248 is 2 1/2 months wages, more or less. hmmmmm.................................need to talk to anna and samantha bt s is round dans and i dnt no where anna is and i dnt hv ne cred on my fne! o well xxx

      Hi I'm the one that randomly appears on this says very little, never says anything intelligent and usually agrees with Kes, and I'm about to do it again!  That made sence, my first impressions of people that I met at primary school still stand and I think that they probaly will for the rest of my life.  I also think that in the long term your first opinions are usually your final ones, what is it they say, once a bitch always a bitch??  Sorry I'm having an actual break from coursework for a change, I'm a bit annoyed with it so am leaving it for 10 minutes listening to some loud music and then I'm going to go back and tackle it.  We had this silly revison seminar today.  I expect that some people found it helpful, but personally I did not.  I want to have a rant but don't know what to rant about, actually yes I do.   I have some friends who tell me things and then expect me not to tell anyone else, this is all good and fair but do they not realise that this is putting alot of pressure upon you?  For example Bob tells you that Jim has been sleeping with Sue, whilst Jim was going out with Jane.  How are you meant to react??  (That little story was purely fictional I just made it up, no one is sleeping with each other, well they are but you know what I mean!! I hope!?)  How are you meant to keep something like that to yourself?  So you learn to live with it, when Jane says to you that she has secretly been doing things with Fred?? Please please please bear in mind that I have made this up!!!  I actualy have made it up so dont go saying that one of r mates has dun this and the otha has dun that.  Anyway back to my rant..............  So you know these two things and dont know what to do when Martha and her cat cum up and tell u that they have been beaten up by sum fatty blokes.  But you cant tell anyone because then they'll get beaten up again!!  This is the dilema that many of us face daily, do you say something to someone and face the consequences of your actions or do you keep quite and keep on mulling over what is going on in your head.  I'm a person who usually tells because aledgedly a problem shared is a problem halved, but is that really true??  And dont you want to protect your mates, cos int that what a good mate should do??? xx

      Isn't it strange what changes your perception of someone? Like you may think that someone has no friends, but then they always do. Everyone always knows someone that you don't, has been somewhere you haven't and knows things you don't. Somehow they always want to rub this in your face. "Oh, you don't know Bob?" Then Bob turns out to be the saddest person on the planet who's hobbies is collecting glass. But you weren't to know that, and for all you know Bob might be the next Bon Jovi *better not to know him then* I still haven't placed some people. They're swimming round in my head. What makes someone cool though, or funny? Does one thing that they say alter your whole view of them and should it? I guess it depends what it is. If it's something really prejudice or anti-you then maybe it should *sudden pear craving* but if it's only something that they say off hand *is that a real word/thing?* then maybe it shouldn't. Most people say that first impressions always count and it's hard to change those. So people that you've known for years base their view of you on how they first say you all those years ago? Maybe I should become a Psychiatrist. Then I can think of all these questions for other people to answer. :D Uhh... or maybe Mr Nutbrown *my english teacher* will lock me in a room till I think of the answers... Hmm... *insert clever conclusion here, or in the comments box :P*

You'd probably have to drink about a bath's worth to actually get cancer from it though. But still! Coke are evil! *don't make me give you the coke talk again* Yup, there's a lot of boycotting out there to do and I intend to stick to it! *hell, there'll probably a boycott to boycott my boycott but that would just be confusing.* Umm... my pc's cracking so I'll have to post later.

Mmm quite scary that I can actually imagine listening to it! Oh, I'm doing a tango for one of my compositions so that's why I'm listening to it! Not too random. Wow, it just got cooler, the 70s backing singers! Yeay! Ahh, it's people like Pudelsi *is it a person* who make GCSE music worth doing... heheee! she plonta? What's that all about...? Anyway back to a slightly more interesting for you but less for me point.... Taaangoooo Libiiiidoooo! *ahem* Oh, it's Polish! That's why it's so strange to listen to! Geez five minutes? No chance! I also got myself some fair trade chocolate! The fair trade freak in me has been set free! No one is safe! Well... actually you are unless I see you near Nestle products. And fair trade clothes too! Yeay! So go order a catalogue ok?  urlLink http://www.peopletree.co.uk

Anyway how was I supposed to know she was Welsh? Basically, big OOPS. But I would never say that anyway. Mmm... I just need to go to sleep, that always solves everything, I need to recharge my hyper batteries. Then I got locked out of my house for a hour and a half cause my brother had my key and didn't leave it for me to find. I gave it to him cause he wanted to get it! Yup, definatly cursed. Then just generally being an ass all day, not good! Guess I'll have to bugger lent and go eat a load of sinfully dark chocolate. Sounds good, ne?

Anyway I was doing good yesterday! I was at the co-op promoting fair trade products, surrounded by fair trade chocolate samples... But I held out! (for about two hours) Then I gave in and ate a load. :D I guess about two weeks of lent is enough really. Seeing as heaven doesn't exisit and all, it was more like a test of will and an experimental try and be healthy for a bit.  Guess it failed. Ah well, back to chocolate... Mmm...

      Lol Laura. So it's a guy you're sending this email to? Teachers are dumb when it comes to notes. So long as you're writing something, and looking at them intelligently they think you're doing the work. Fools. Oh, have you heard about the theft story yet? It's official, me and Izzy are outlaws. :P Not exactly your average criminal but hey, variation helps the world go round. There was a painting of Izzy's being displayed in the entrance hall that she didn't want there and didn't give her permission to be there so obviously we went and nicked it. Hehe, or I convinsed her to *i'm a bad influence on everyone* So we legged it down to the drama block, and tried to take the picture out. Then Izzy broke the glass *cringe* into three perfect bits *wow, isn't that lucky! it's a real story though kids, don't try this at school. my freak luck doesn't rub off on everyone* she must have been leaning on it or something... Then all these kids came in cause it was 'there room' so we made up some lame excuse like 'modern art' and told them not to tell anyone. *sheesh gullable* Then we legged it and asked Pete what to do. He didn't know so we legged it back to the frame and Izzy panicked. But I was cool and calm, hehe I could be a con artist! Izzy wanted to take the 'dump it and run' option, but who the hell would nick a painting, take it out and dump the frame? Oh, I mean who would nick a school persons painting? So we took it up to the art block, glass and all. We told them that some kid had nocked it off the wall during between lesson time, it broke and it took us 90 minutes to get it to them cause of various things. Man we're good. Muhahahaaaa.... I could be the next evil mastermind in a James Bond movie.... Or a Disney movie, I'm willing to start small and work my way up. :) Little bit psychotic. Totally in control.

      OMG! How wierd was I today?! Odd statement to make but...yeah... anyway...I was just stupidly extremely happy today, for like the first time in ages. Any suggestions? Cos seriously I have no idea! Anna said that it might be radiation (we were in physics at the time) but thats not possible cos I am not exposed to excessive radiation! : )  RANDOM HAPPINESS! I need an answer!!!! its driving me nutty. there is only one time that i can remember feeling like this and that was, like, about 2 years ago, i think summer 2002 if you can remember what happened then. if not i will not explain because you were probably one of the only people that wasn't told about my little secret. : )    : )    : )    : )  hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!!!! cya xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx : )

Fun for winding people up with though *not that i have...* It actually a lump of ice-cream covered in chocolate and extra bits so you get this really hard lump that's inedible. *i guess describing it like that didn't help* Eeek I think I might end my blog here before it gets worse... *i also have to go do stuff. i really do have a life you know!* (Yeah right.)

       urlLink TPS Registration  Why did no one tell me about this before? Finally, a legal way to actually block spam calls. And if they do get through you can complain and they get sued. So everyone's happy! And it doesn't cost money! Yeay! Not that I didn't like talking to all those nice people who were trying to sell me cars... Unsolicited? Me thinks yes. All I need now is a massive block of cheese covered in chocolate to make my day complete.

      Yeay Happy Easter / Happy excuse for lazing around and pigging out! It's 18:15 and so far I've been sat watching two movies under a blanket pigging out. But I'm not really sad cause my brother was with me :P Ahh and we skipped dinner. Yeay! (Totally because my parents aren't here) Mmm... should fit revising in somewhere. Kind of non-existant at the moment. Ooops... Well socialising is more important anyway :P Cause it's too easy to forget your friends and not arrange to do anything. That's why I have to drag all your butts out of your houses and get you guys to do stuff! Really :P And you lot are soooo heavy! *hehe tis fun to insult peeps when they can't insult me back* Anyway, I think I might have burned off som calories while I was typing so I'll have to go back downstairs and eat more chocolate. Remember. If it's fair trade it tastes better.

Yup, it'll make you go crazy, as if you weren't crazy enough anyway! Actually, do you recon there are more people with mental illnesses now? Hmm... interesting... *If you're interested in that type of thing* Which obviously everyone is! Oh dear, gone into Reef listening mode. It's down hill from here folks... right downstairs and to the fridge to find dessert I'm afraid. *desert dessert?* Oh my god! There's a whole desert in my fridge! That explains why everything tastes funny... Well Tesco were trying to kill us by selling off potato salad. :D Hehe, I don't really believe everyone's trying to kill me, it's just what the voices tell me.

Oh wait, they are, but in companies. Damn, have to get me one of those.

      Todays a goth day. And we all know what that means - loud Metallica, depressing bad vibes that seem to spread everywhere and stress. Ok, so maybe stress is always an issue... or maybe it's all in our heads seeing as it isn't anything physical... so it's all in our heads! Obviously my way of dealing with unhappiness is to get so confused that I can't remember what I'm sad about! It works too, until about two days later when I can't remember why I'm unhappy and why the cat is locked in the fridge. Ahh well, I'll just blame my brother and continue blissfully unaware *then about two days after that I'll go crazy* Oh, my brother's back from hospital which is cool. The phone will be jammed with all the calls though, and the tv will be playing non stop kiddy stuff *it's what happens to you when you're ill* I guess I'll just have to hide upstairs and revise. Have a nice day and try and stay upwind from the evil goth vibes. Peace, love and cheese cake *and hopefully someone will teach you how to spell and you won't be deluded by my bad use of english*

Oh, and I'll make it so anyone can comment *no swearing, and we know about five languages so no foreign swearing!* And I'm as crazy and stressed as ever! Yeay!

My brother is in hospital cause he's got appendicitis, my aunty's got cancer, so's my Grandpa and I've got a lot of stress about exams and everything. Actually... good excuses to go mad aye? Well... I was thinking about putting psychosis down on a form the other day as 'medical information' because I never put anything which is really boring! And hey, I need to be different! Err... sorry tv, as much as I love five hour old movies I think I'll have to miss this one. Geez... it's like lemmings! Loads of people/little green blobs running around and being stupid. Oooh... good thing for exam stress / lack of knowledge about who you are - Lifehouse. Yeay! Mmm... I think I might go sniff some glue :P

      pink bananas?! Interesting concept, so weird it may just work! lol. no u katie, u can make it work! Woo, GO KATIE! cant wait til tomoz lunch, i love pizza! but i dunno whot to wear, whether to wear my little black dress which i have worn yet or wear the stuff i wore to my aunties wedding or something entirely different again! Will decide when i see the weather tomorrow! I have finally figured out why it is i have been so miserable recently. I was supposed to be going on hols with samantha and claire and emmy, but then our plans fell thru for a number of reasons. the theory only came to me yesterday when my dad decided that i was invisible and he could just talk to liam, who i ws trying to talk to, over me. and thats it, when i am with my friedns i can get myself heard cos i have more power over you lot than i do with my family, and i am more at ease with u lot, and thats wot i missed. i wanted to be able to have the power for a whileand i just wnted to be away from my parents so that i had control over my own life for a while am alot happier now that i hv realised this but i wud have prefered to hv realised it earlier!

      I dunno about the evil thing. Shouldn't we rebel against the state? I don't think people who are weak willed do rebel, it's the strong willed ones. These people exploit problems in the system. *yes, it's the system* There are people out there getting away with millions of pounds of fraud and yet for the public face we look down on petty thiefs more. I think people take things too far if they don't understand or can't empathise. We're all human! *well i'm obviously from Beta 5* Anyway, seeing as my random ramblings aren't really that coherant... Back to thinking about how experiences affect you *always an easy mind numbing topic* Do you think people would be phased by pink bananas?

      YEAAAAAAAAAH! Glastonbury was soooo cool! I even have a bottle of Glastonbury mud! And we didn't care about the rain - it made it more fun! It was hot for half of the time anyway which was cool. I wore my sumo suit when it was sunny! Yup, I was the freak everyone pointed and laughed at. And it was fun! The whole experience was worth all the bother; the one and a half hours of hell, lugging around a massive bag, the money, the annoyance when it rained, and dealing with bugs in the tent. But then for all that you get a once *hopefully five :P* in a life time experience, with all the hippie extras that no where else would have! What other festival would have people doing free massages and a giant LOVE statue that you could sit on? And I got to see all these amazing bands! Damn, missed out on I am Kloot, and they're actually kinda good! Anyway... so much stuff in my head! I'll go phone someone otherwise I'm gonna piss everyone off :P Haha, inflict it on one person only :D

Spoke to izzy's mum tho who came in to get her jackets dry cleaned for a wedding (?), she seemed rather surprised to see me, so i take it izzy didnt tell her! All i can really say today is HAHA! UR AT GLASTONBURY, OUTSIDE AND ITS RAINING!, where as i was at work in the dry and warm! lol

      Did u no that to join YHA for one year, for an U18 its only £7, thats really good, cos its for a year. A bit random i no but me and samantha mite be going t ostay in a youth hostel at some stage during the summer. Word has it that most people got invited round to jenny's this evening, those who werent on hols or werent already busy. well, i fell into neither of the previous catagories yet i wasnt invited. Thats gratitude for you, i spent ages trying to get hold of people so we could go out, half of them couldnt come so i wasted loads of credit and then they dont even invite me when they all go round someones house. I mean, i could understand if it was just really close people going round, but for god sake, shes invited emma *no offence to emma meant*, but her and emma hardly ever speak. It just seems really strange, i've even started coming up with conspiracy theories aswell, cos samantha and anna havent replied to the texts that i sent them. o well, no one loves, except for the guys last nite trying to save form the little twirps! lol xxx

      i disagree with you Katie, I think some people do not have the power to be good. These are the people who are weak willed and rebel and dont understand right and wron and when a joke isnt actually funny any more and when they have taken things to far *not talking about certain people inparticlur, honest*. I had such a good time yesterday. I am really glad i came out cos i wasnt gonna. Its a shame i had to leave just before 5 but then i wudnt have had a brill nite last nite. We went walking on the Mendips and it was soo cool. There were 8 of us, me, mike, steve, ross, ian bell, james rogers, reese owen and *dont no his his first name* crosby!  We were at the sqdn choosing groups and i got shoved in the group with the little brats, but credit where its due, mike did try to save me from them but mr bloody fat bastard satcey wouldnt have that. So we went walking and then we got back to the mini bus and found out that ross and the two little ones in his group had got lost in the woods, so mr stacey and mr trenchard had to go find them  while me, mike and steve and the rest sat in the minibus *me, mike and steve were eating my strawberry laces!*. but it was a good nite. would have been better without the brats but hopefully ext time i'll get put into a good group! This morning has not been soo good. My is snapped at me when i told her she should get up cos otherwise she was going t obe late, then a huge arguement erupted that ended with me slamming my bedroom door on her and then sitting down cos i felt faint and being told off for doing so and then falling up my ladder getting onto my bed. I have been sat in misery most of the morning and i have noone to talk to cos everyone has gone on holiday, so this weekend and all next week is gonna be so boring. i will keep postnig to let u no what happens in nailsea while ur off on ur jolly at glastonbury!

      But isn't evil a strange consept? Is it born from natural desires or beginnings, or is it something that we are subjected to? Something that we learn? Is it something that is born with us and dies with us or does it gradually develop if we are surrounded by people who encourage the behavior associated with evil acts? We all have the power to be evil and the power to be good. *couldn't you just tell that was coming?*

      Evil sides with Evil, and it cannot be stopped. An important lesson to learn when dealing with ignorant family members. I h8 my brother and sister sooo much it is unbelievable. We were sat having tea and they ganged up on me, taking the mick adn winding me up. I got upset, went upstairs but my mum persuaded me to finish my tea cos she didnt want me getting ill again so i went downstair to eat it, finished and then went and sat in the front room with mum and dad. I sed 'Why are there Evil things in this house?' and my dad started taking their side, saying they are not evil and that i provoke them adn do it to them and that i get all that i deserve.  I dont no y but i just feel really down at the moment. Its probably the weather, and the stress and the fact that everyone is going away next week except for me, matt, dave, meg, claire, emily and emma. but chances are the only people who will come out everyday will be matt and dave, and i dont think i can spend a whole week with them. Its just not fair, i worked so hard to organise for me, samantha, emily and claire to go away, i made all the arrangements and found out prices etc and then they just gave up on the idea. o well, its not fair for u to listen to all of this. i'll go find somewhere else to rant at.

      Heeey Laura that sounds cool! Good luck planning everything - it's hard enough to get everyone to come to a party! But I'm sure everyone will go. Obviously it'll just be so that they can buy candy floss... but that's cool - we can steal it from them! Oh who cares if it rains, I have two heavy duty army poncho's that will fit at least three people under each one! And it would be cool. We could try to fly a kite! Of course everyone will have forgotten physics by then and probably try to fly the handle while holding the kite. Yup, sounds like good fun!

      Aww. Turning point in life. *just don't turn around, someone's bound to have left some screwed up stuff* Face it with naive optimism! Wish for the best and look to find it. Don't expect anything - go out and get it! Okay... prep talk over, ok everyone? *how patronising, make your own dreams and drive!* Uhh I guess I haven't been reading enough to communicate through words very efficiently. Damn, now I'm using long clever words! One more exam left, then our GCSE's will have completely finished. By Thursday we'll all be free! So don't just bum around at home, live the life that's out there! Don't rely on other people to wait for you otherwise you'll fall behind. Make it so that when you go back you have a whole load of stuff to tell people. Yup, confused brain. Hmm... must remember the Battle of Little Big Horn was in 1876... then everything will be fine... Or it will when m brain stops singing in exams! Aargh!

      God that last post was way tooo sane! I'm losing it, i am losing my insanity! aaah, that sounds about normal *does a quick trial run of freakiness on Megan , Megan just stares at me blankly* YAY! My brother came 5th out of some odd in 800m! (out of those doing GCSE P.E.) which i thort was quite good. not as good as my first (obviously not at school, cant beat bethan!) but good all the same, adn my sis came 6 out of 8 in 1500 for year 7, and 13th out of 20 year 7's and 8's overall, which was good. I am losing my hold, but i am health wise feeling pretty crap at da mo! I gotta go to the doctors at some stage cos my mum thinks i mite have skin cancer. She's probably just worrying too much! LAST EXAM TOMORROW! YAY! Cant believe its history, but hey who cares, no more exams. You lot can all come round to mine afterwards i wud expect, that is if u read this in time. but we'd have to go up in my room, and u'd have to sit on the floor, cos noone can sit on the bottom bunk cos its my sisters bed and only one can sit on the top bunk and thats me! lol xxxx

      Either Thursday 15th July, or Friday 16th July, I am thinking of planning for the whole group to go into weston, just have a chilled day down on the beach. we'd have to go by train, but that'll only be a couple of £'s and then there would spending money, but i think it would be quite fun. Obviously it would depend on the weather and the number of people around that want to come, but all going wel, i think it would be really fun. tell me if ur interested

      Well, I went to my aunties wedding yesterday and it was soo much fun! After the Ceremony we went to this really nice pub, and had loads of nice food and took loads of photos. and then some of us went back to my aunties house (my family, my grandparents and my mums uncle and his sons) and all the kids, we were all in the garden mucking around. I was looking after Katie, megan and debbie were mucking around, and my brother was playing football with ricky, ben and dean. I dont no where emma was, apparantly her family havent seen her since easter when she walked out, and she didnt come to the wedding.  It was really nice to be able to see everyone again. Ricky has the cutest cat, and his cat has kittens and they have two left, and they were trying to get my mum to bring it home but my dad wouldnt let us have it. It was soooo cute, it was ginger and white and i really wanted it. But what i was really amazed about was that me and ben are still quite close and so are me and Katie and we havent seen eachother for three years. since the christening. Ben was winding me up like he always does, telling dean to get me and kick the football at me but we both wind eachother up so we're even. as for Katie, she delighted in giving me a tour of the house, and dragging me outside and inside and outside and inside! It was such a good day. cant wait until the baby is born and it has its christening! But then there will be 7 kids!!!! god ive blabbered!

      Noooo there's loads of nice Vans shoes out there in size 7! You can even get womens Vans... such novelty! £25 on a pair of flip flops?That's actually kind of psychotic! I went shopping today and I got a german army waterproof poncho for £6! Hell it may smell funny but it's gonna keep me nice and dry at Glastonbury! *even if the hippies do give us dirty looks :P* I also bought some stupidly bright pink hair dye and I'm gonna take my inflatable sumo suit. So that means everyone has to watch all of Glastonbury and look out for me cause I'm definatly gonna be on tv! Just a bit scared that someone's gonna try to sumo wrestle me... but it'll be ok. I'll run away screaming. We also got glow in the dark stars to stick on our tent, we still won't be able to find it but it'll look really cool! Eugh slightly too much information on the whole Glastonbury plan. Muhahahaaa but I don't care - it's gonna be loads of fun! Warning kids, too much shopping and smelling funny plastic affects your brain in weird ways.

      Hummm liking the rant there.  I buy mens running shorts because I dont want floressant pink ones and I always get strange looks!!  O der I spent £25 on a pair of flip flops, nearly bought some rocket dogs in raw aswell but they didnt have my size, then I went on the hunt for a pair of vans but they didnt have them in my size anywhere. What is this, lets not do any nice shoes in a size 7??  Humm my shoes rant over.  xx

      Why is it that in our society just because the younger generation doesn't have as much knowledge as the older generation people feel that they can abuse their ignorance? Shouldn't we encourage the younger generation to learn these things so that they won't get scammed and instead know their full rights? And for the lady at Cassidy's: it could have been a fancy dress party, and women can wear men's t-shirts, get over yourself! I don't want to rant. It feels like a waste of space.

Pointless! anyway.i have sooo many peeps i need to talk to about days out, like down to paignton and stuff. god i am going to busy this summer. and this summer is supposed to be my break! its too warm, or is it just me. i cant believe it is this warm and i'm not even slightly tanned. its just ridiculous. its being stuck inside revising. i mean, i know i cud do it outside but its just too distracting. better go. gotta revise for history..... *damn distractions*

      Hehe I would edit your last post Lynne but I'm not that nice! And it's obvious that we're shit at football anyway! Oh well :P Millionaires become so by being stupidly lucky half the time. The other half of the time they're people who aren't amazing but have a hell of a lot of dedication. Then somewhere there are people who are actually clever and become millionaires *i'm sure i'll fit in somewhere* :P Naaah I don't actually mean it, I would probably boycott myself if I did become a millionaire! So therefore tests are pointless and therefore is over-rated. Damn hyphens, who created them? They're sooo annoying! But anyway... it's A Levels that actually matter, they make up your UCAS points and that dictates which university you can get into. Still it's not good to totally fail your GCSE's, it's about proving something to yourself plus it can't be good for your confidence. Just try your best and do good! They onl matter for people who are leaving really. Also it's kinda good to get an A in that one subject where ou were predicted a C and the teacher patronised you all through GCSE's. Ahh I'm gonna enjoy that.

      I have to say I have given up caring about exams, no really!  People make out that they are the be all and end all of your life, they are definatly not. So what you fail all of them, there is someone somewhere who will listen to what you have to say, and you will end up a millonaire.  Or you could take them again, what does it matter?? That said I really need 2 work for history, such a shame!!  Please dont let it slip out that my true love is karl the gay gnome, I love him too much and it may damage his reputation.....I shall be playing human ping pong though it sounds like great fun, not that I ever get that bored, deffo not! Hee hee!  There are small children in my street chanting and blowing a loud hooter, is there like tennis or football on or something? That beckham bloke, really no idea!!!! NOT we are currently winning one nill to FRANCE! Tis amazing!! Best be off second half is just about to start.

      i am the only one in our group thats not completely freaking out about exams. well i am kinda freaking out about history, cos if i dont get a high enough english mark then i have to rely on my istory to get me into the psychology course. its quite amusing really cos most people think that i am amazingly clever and that i will fly throught the exams, but i'm not, i am shit at exams. yes i no alot but all the stuff i no about is completely irrelevant, unless they have started an exam on chart music, or on wildlife from al around the world. i mean, i can name an animal for every single letter of the alphabet.... a=antelope, b=butterfly, c=crocodile, d=duck-billed platypus *or wud that count as p?*, e=elephant, f=frog, g=gorilla, h=horse, i=iguana....etc, etc i am wasting my life but there is a good thing about exams. i have made many realisations. most people say dreams are about something that will happen in the near future. this is not true. ur dreams are always based on some thing that has happened in the last few days before it. also, in the R.E exam, it was saying that it was not gods fault that there is suffering in the world, it is our own but surely god created us in his image and he created us so therefore it is his fault due to causation. as you cans ee i spend too much of the time in my exams doing absolutely fuck all, and i think about things to much.

      Write about anything and everything! Like how you play the ping game when you look at people at the end of exams. *you can ping off people to see who they're looking at, and then who that person is looking at until you hit a wall or a clock...* Ping cause of computer stuff. And you can write about your true love: Karl the gay knome. Gnome? Where did knome come from? Oops 6 hours sleep not good. Anyway... that's enough random crap for today I have to save if for exams! *yup RE was one big block of random crap* Like history... how are we going to survive?

      It's weird not being at school. *damn analytical button is turned on... i should turn that off someday* Now we're not forced to spend time with anyone, or to see people that we don't like. We could go and hide in a hole I guess but there aren't holes big enough out there. But not being at school has kind of screwed the whole social system that we had going... not like anyone was really paying attention to it anyway. All the layers have been destroyed. Theoretically anyone could talk to anyone else. But we still don't. Is it gonna be any different when we get to 6th form? Am I ever going to get to Glastonbury?

      Neh. Elitest groups scare me. I figure if I use big words no one will properly understand me :) Even though it's supposed to be the other way around... Anyhooo... Exams! Stress! No fun :( Hehe I wrote that in my English exam though! My brother must have influenced me too much because under the 'ideal school' question I wrote a load of socialist crap! Which is good I guess... in a very small way. Hmm, I wonder if the guy who marks it will notice? Oh well. Yngwie Malmsteen is such a weird guy... is it a band? Oops. Hehe... Just checked - he's a guy and he has a 'Ask Yngwie' section on his website. Awww that's just asking for trouble.  urlLink http://www.yngwie.org/  Download - I am A Viking - damn weird.

      Hello, I am at home and am bored, there is nowt ont telly and nowt to do :(.  O well I shall talk some random rubbish to this little baby instead!  Hee hee..... I have gone properly potty.   Today I went to school and participated in two exams.  English was interesting to say the least and I feel that geography was a breeze.  O for all people who do not know the first history exam is MEDICINE THROUGH TIME.  Just to make it clear I put it in capital letters.   There is a guy opposite my house who has a mohawk that goes all the way down infront of his eyes, how annoying!!!  Strange also.  I think to curb my boredness I shall go to bed or something, I probably wont get alot of sleep tomorrow night because Anna and Jess are staying over.  It should be a laugh, only 17 days until we fly to Paris.  I'm so excited!!!! AGGGHHHHHHHH.  Right controlling ones self.  I am going to go and make a sandwich and eat it!

      Maths isn't good! 60% for an A - sounds easy huh? NO! It's soooo hard! Eugh... oh well, we'll all flukily survive some way or other (it always happens like that) Damn, just got it for another two years after that. :| I'm crazy! Aww, good luck Laura... and generally everyone who is doing GCSE maths cause we all need help! Oh, did you know that some year 10's are going to be doing it with us, a year early? How stressful must that be, fitting the whole GCSE course into a year! We're gonna be soooo gutted if they get better marks than us!

      Sausage...? Don't worry, the cats have probably eaten it! So long as it wasn't soaked in Reef or something like that... Oh we found the Reef box! Very clever :P Uhh where's the santa's hat? I'm glad everyone had fun! But come on, the sadistic pass the parcel got everyone in a stupid mood. Wasn't it cool! *slightly obsessed with sadistic pass the parcel* Hehe we got Laura to gallop down the street with a plastic sword making the clip clop sound! Wow, how er... different? And dig my unarrangedness! I like parties more when they're go with the flow and not at set times we have to do set things *also it's a lot less hassal and I can be lazy* :D Ahh so long as everyone enjoys themselves who cares :P *that's my ethos* And don't worry... if anyone wasn't having fun I would've really made them dance on nails! But I did wear the sumo suit! *runs away leaving a big crater* (phew) Yup, in my head I make sense.

      Hello tiny little people who undoubtably look upto me!!! Heehee....  Well I have to say your party was a laugh Katie.  Have you found the santas hat that we put on the statue thing??  It looked bloomin good when we put it there.  You may also find a sausage hiding in a bush, that was all Jess's fault, her idea not mine, lay the whole blame on her!!! You may also find a reef box, that was on her head to at some point, it luked bloomin gd too!! Ummm had best be off, cant remember a thing about biology or geography, uh oh!!! xx

      Oh yeah my 50th birthday party (as if) Weeel I was planning on just having everyone over.... maybe throwing water balloons at them while they're stading on pins - nothing special. Nah I don't know but maybe going on the Jackass website will give me some inspiration! Hmm what about the fun party game of 'who can jump the active volcano'? or 'lets find out if dogs really do bite' (that's a bad mental reference to a saying i can't quite remember but figured i'd throw in anyway) No really what are we going to do? Any good party films? Er... I don't think 'Drinking Milk is Evil and Soya Rules The World' got that good reviews. (you know who you are :P) I'll go rent a crap one that involves vegetables and plywood... *in a non dodgey way* - just incase you were thinking of suing me.

      Lol awww how harsh, just get rid of your siblings! It is kinda annoying though when they're at home and you selflishly want the whole house to yourself. Like on a 'me' day, you need them sometimes. Mmm I smell nice :P Or maybe it's the polish that's on all those cloths beside me... hmm. Stalked by polish again? *sigh* Oh Laura you should find out when people go on holiday or someone should generally know... it would make arranging things a whole lot easier! But on the day of our exam results we definatly should all go out and do something, you know the usual, trash someones house, go into Bristol etc.

      i cant believe i am having this party. my parents are gonna freak&nbsp;if they find out that about 20 people are coming instead of 10. (thats if everyone invited comes!) and i have just done the single most stupid thing in the entire world. i have invited robyn to stay that weekend so she can meet everyone and we can see eachother. i am actually kinda hoping that she says she cant come that weekend because i dont no where she's gonna sleep if she does come down cos we dont even have a spare mattress any more i dont think. may be i can get rid of my bro and sis for a couple of nites. that'd be a bit better.

      u'll never believe this kt. after talking about the fact that my brother didnt get punished for always stealing my stuff and that he'll never learn his lesson, guess what he went and done. stole my tape player again. and then when i shouted at him and then at my dad for not doing anything about it, i got bollocked. he isnt even getting punished this time, he has been told, like every other time, that if he does it again he will be in serious trouble and he will get punished. life is sooo unfair. had a great time today tho, cant believe how lame i am at bowling. i didnt win a single game, i jst kept coming second!&nbsp;

      Its a good idea kt, but i'd only be able to go on the sunday, cos i work on saturdays and we'd have to leave pretty early in the morning to get our money's worth. and then there is the cost of travel. does ne one really have parents who are willing to get us all down there?

       Woooow it's like a whole new how to blog thingie! *just let me play with it for a bit*   Woooow! Huh...   Kinda kiddy. Is the small small even readable?   I kinda like it like this. Uhh where'd the photo thing come from? Oh yeah... meaningful post meaningful post. Not one full of butterflies and strawberry flavoured apples? Oh. &nbsp;Shame. What about my 'long term relationship'? Nope, that would be too sweet and I would babble for aggeeees. Okay, point: Do you think people know who you are better than you know? Like when you're mean or something and it's completely unexpected to you but the pschoanalyist in the corner knows why you just released your angry rage on that person at that time? And habits, but I guess they're accepted by your brain as normal and not to be analysed. But how do they become habits in the first place? And psychiatrists... they seem to know some people better than they know themselves. Or is that just through learning and knowledge?   Ok pointless babble over. Now to find a picture of my room colour.

And might not go on Saturday cause I'm going to meet my brother in Wales, there's an Amnesty thing going on there *yeeeah that explains it* Oh sorry about shitty meaning nothing post. When my room's painted and all my stuff's back in the dark corners it used to be in and when my head comes back down I guess I'll say something meaningful. *comment BBE: a few years*

      for some reason the dash board is saying that there was a post written yesterday when there clearly wasnt! Kt where were u last nite. we had soo much fun at anna's body shop party, or at least i did! U no the whole phone tree idea for when organising things? I tried to make one up but its really difficult to do it cos i dont have evryone's number and there are certain people who only talk to certain others and getting it to go in a circle is very difficult. Cos i dont want people calling someone elses house unless they are really familiar with the household they are calling! Do u wanna have a go? also ne news on bus times for sunday?

Aaargh how much make-up is out there to buy? I'm broke but nevermind, I guess I can buy a toothbrush or something. I think I'm gonna stick with this old crappy computer - too much electrical waste, you better recycle your old one! Maybe if I save money by not buying a new pc my parents will buy me a piano to take to university... Hmm. *or maybe not*

      I am COMPLETELY knackered! I dunno y cos i havent done much but i am. Its not fair, i really wanted to go to emilys sleepover but i cant cos i am working and i wanted to go to all of the party in the afternoon but i cant cos i am working. i wont be thre til about 4:30, so i will have missed an hour and i will be starving because so that i can be there by 4:30 i am working thru my lunch hour, so as soon as i get there all the food will disappear! (nothing unusual there, then) Biology thismorning was soo cool. We got to cut up a liver, and kimmi was completely grossed out by it all so i waved a bit in her face, and then she saw the half filled pot that the liver pieces came out of and freaked! I am deffo doing Bio, Geog, Psych and DT next year. Its gonna be hard work and alot of money but it should be fun! (£250 for the geog trip and at least £200 for the bio trip!) gotta go, cant wait to see shrek 2 tomorrow, but have no idea what to wear!

Oh well I guess we all have to go with what our brains tell us, let's just hope they haven't been totally fried by revision! Anyhooo life so far - I kinda broke my wardrobe; the door, the draws, the pole thingy that you hang clothes on. Ooops. So that means I have to go Ikea shopping! Yeay! It's such a freaky place though! Never mind... I can buy a really cool strange lamp or something. Oh, and I broke my toe and it's all red/purple down the side :( Nowchie! Eww and then at night I have a banana strapped to it and in the morning my foot is washed with tea tree oil. Niiiice. Oh that's not cause my toe's broken, it's for veruccas. So life is weird. Like always. Kinda nice and refreshing, maybe the future is worth the wait.

      YAY! I only have to be in school til thursday!  I am doing Geography tomorrow and poss media studies, then wednesday i am doing Psycho (!), and then thursday i am doing design tech and then biology! It's really funny, cos we have two ants nest in our rundown conservatory, and some of them are flying ants, and there is a little whole that is just big enough for the sparrows to fit thru, so they are coming into the conservaotry to get the insects and then they dont realise that there is actually glass there and they fly into it, altho the last bird was smart enough to realise it was glass, and no exit with out got thwack into it! its still quite amusing and the birds are so little and soo cute! lol! I am going to have to go on a huge shopping spree and get some more clothes for next. I have plenty of tops but i need more trousers (at the mo i have 3 pairs that are constantly on rotation) and i need to get some more jackets and jumpers cos i have three nice ones and one of them is a huge bright blue fleece (i'm sure u no the one i am talking about). This will please my dad becos he is always haveing a go at me about spending my money! Its strabge i dont write o here THAT often bt whenever i do, i start with nothing to write and then end up writing quite alot, most of it being complete crap!

      hey, erm, i actually feel like i am talking to myself writing all these posts and wot not but never mind. i will probably see you tomorrow so u probably will be reading this thinking 'she has already told me that' but basically, on the 28th i have decided people can come round at anytime they want (with in reason) but be warned i wont be awake and moving til ten and i will have to have a shower and get dressed! (unless you want me walking around in my pyjama's and scruffy hair all day)  u no i wouldn't let u in if i wasn't ready for u anyway. i dont think any of you have seen me without make and thats the way i wanna keep it! lol!

      okay, revised gest list is as follows you anna samantha claire emily emma izzy laura jenny jess dave matt alex and obviously me. there is room for one or two extras if ppl really beg me, but i can't have evryones boyf over cos i told samantha she wasnt to invite dan bcos he really gets on my nerves, and a load of other peoples aswell (e.g. matt and dave) d'ya think that is okay? i invited robyn but we looked at travel prices and it would be quite expensive for her to come down so she aint coming. pls dont arrange nething for next thurs if ur around becos i am working that day!

      london was good. charlene wasnt at my nan alice's but ben and debbie were at my nan and granddads which made it soo much fun. too much to tell you here. it would take ages to write it all down! Am in a bit of trouble. my mum asked me what is happening for the 28th and how many people are coming, and as i cant actually lie to my mum, i had to tell her the truth and say that possibly more than 20 peop,e were coming (if evryone can come that is) and she is not happy. i have been told i have to let a few people down. will give you the revised guest list as soon as i have done but dont worry u will still be on it!
