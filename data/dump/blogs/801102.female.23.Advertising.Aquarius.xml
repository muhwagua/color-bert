       Things that piss me off:  *  Playboy 's Girls of the Big 12.  I am so freaking sorry for being a female, a feminist and in the possession of two ovaries.  I'm not mad at  Playboy .  That magazine is for 45 year-old men who want to feel like they're doing something racy but are really trying to understand the cartoons.  I'm mad at those dumbass girls who took off their clothes and pronounced MU a party school with a lot of bisexual tendencies, like girls are making out all over the place just to please the boys.  Yes, I have time to go to boat parties and make-out with the unattractive girls (so the feature gal says) that run rampant across the Quad.  I do it between squeezing myself into pleather pants and buying teeny tiny shorts that say "MIZZOU" across the butt.  And what about the part where she talks about guys dating down because of the low quality of girls?  Excuse me?????  I think boys on this campus are lucky they get dates at all.  It'll be a fine day when women come to the realization that we don't have to take their crap anymore and fire their sorry asses from every Fortune 500 company across the board.   (*Disclaimer: I am not speaking about the boys that I love and cherish and who delight me to no end.  I am speaking of the boys that wear the baseball hats with the word "Cocks" written across the front.)   * Anybody going to class in a shirt that does not reach the top of their pants.  This is Philosophy of War and Peace, not Look Like a Hoochie on Thursday Night.  * Whoever deemed shoes that make you bleed "appropriate footwear for women."   Things that make me rather happy:  * Rock Quarry Road is finally open.  * Having a super cool new friend whom I believe is my long lost twin.  * Missing my boyfriend (not that it's good that we're apart, but good that I don't like it)

      How much do I like Justin Timberlake's solo song?  A lot.  A whole lot.  Now, at first, I was a little skeptical.  But by the third listen I was totally hooked.  It makes me want to dance.  Dance naked, even.  But that could just be a genetic thing.  It's reminiscent of very early Michael Jackson.  This is definitely a bonus, but as Abby points out, look what happened to the Jackson 5.  I watched television for more than 4 hours last night.  It was amazing.  I now know how Clark Bars are made.  I love the Food Network.

      I've been dorking around with this template for more than an hour and what do I achieve?  A link to my e-mail.  Please use it so I know it wasn't all in vain.  I went to the Corn Maze today and got sufficiently lost.  It was a darn good time, well worth my $6.  Then I ate pizza and chips and salsa.  Soon I will put on makeup and play Nintendo.  Do days get any better than this?  Yes.  But they haven't for a long time.

      No more days until school.  Weekdays, that is.  Ack.  Just to keep you updated on my obsession, I am totally in love with crocheting again (the same can be said for a certain faux New Yorker).  The current blanket looks like basket weave and uses sparkly yarn.  Perhaps I will get a picture of it someday.  I should try to count up how many blankets I've made.  But I feel that would be impossible.  I'll try it as I finish the apple crisp that a new friend and I made the other night.  Oh yes, I've decided to give up advertising and school and all that jazz so I can teach boys how to cook.   Confidential to Boss Lady:  Yesterday wasn't so bad.  I did get to see all the glory that is CDS and had a nice tour of campus.  You'll have to think of some other way to torture me.   Confidential to Lady Bird:  Kiss P for me.  And for the love of God, make the jazz hands stop.

      A lot of things have been learned today (yesterday, actually): 1. Nothing breaks your heart more than the boy you love losing man's best friend. 2. You can find a guy attractive (as in, pleasing to the eye) but not be attracted to him (as in, want to rush through traffic just to catch a glimpse of him). 3. Loving someone with your whole heart doesn't mean to have to love them all the time.  Sometimes you are allowed to love no one at all.  And that person will still love you when you're done with the whole not loving thing. 4. Your mom knows more about you than you yourself ever will. 5. Dads should not engage in any activity requiring jazz hands.  *Quote of the Day (Archive) * "Get out of the street, Fathead!" -- Five year-old Gage, telling campers how his dad (a police officer) tells people to get out of his way over the squad car intercom

      The storm of the century hit CoMo this morning around 1 a.m.  A neighbor's house got hit by lightening, I think.  I know what lightening sounds like as it strikes thanks to a little place called Camp Mudd.  Scares the crap out of you, I'll tell you that.  It also sounds like an exploding car.  Anyway, a house down the street got hit and fire trucks were soon on the scene (they could have been a little faster, we only live a block away from the fire station).  I would have walked down there to see what all the fuss was about, but the streets were flooded and we all know about how I melt when I get wet.  I have this problem where I keep reading books after I'm pretty convinced they suck.  Maybe I'm just trying to give them a chance.  Seriously, don't ever read  Baroque-A-Nova  or  Feminine Intelligence .  We're talking the worst of the worst here.  Books I DO recommend:  The Nanny Diaries   Tunnel Vision  by Keith Lowe  The Fountainhead  by Ayn Rand  There are others.  I've read 22 books since the end of May, so there have got to be other good ones in the bunch.

      Today is a happy day.  It's a day of continuous napping, a SPECTACULAR dinner (made by yours truly, even) and magazine reading.   Things I love:   Jane Real Simple  my enormous bed baths golden retrievers  These past three days have been the best of my life.  Well, of my summer, at least.  How great is it to be dating your best friend?  It's amazing.  Simply amazing.

      Gooooooood morning, Columbia, Missouri!  I'm awake.  A week ago, I had been awake for a little more than an hour, leading a group of eight and nine year-olds through the woods on a "trash hike."  The only person who actually found trash was yours truly, because the little ones get distracted by things, such as trees and their own feet.  I don't know if I'd want to be a camp counselor for life (like I told the other counselors, I think that's a life choice pre-destined at birth, kind of like your sexual orientation), but I sure do miss it.  I miss people hugging me every time they see me, I miss silly jokes that are only funny to the person telling me them, I miss explaining what Aurora Borealis means.  I kind of even miss the school bus.

      Kristo is back in a good mood after 6 p.m., possibly the first time in twelve weeks.  Could this be due to: a) she just finished training over 150 desk attendants all at once? b) her roommate baked an exploding apple pie? c) the love of her life is coming back to her in less than 15 hours?  If you chose C, you are intelligent enough to work at a residence hall front desk.  If you didn't, you probably don't know how to do a round robin even though I explained it to you five times.  Speaking of DA training, I never in my whole life, not even when I was at Rockbridge State Park fighting with a 10 year-old boy, wanted to yell "1-2-3 eyes on me!" more.  I'm sure, however, that unlike the 10 year-old, the DAs didn't know they were supposed to say "1-2, eyes on you!"  This is the problem with college students.  They don't know the words to Princess Pat, they've never heard of Dr. Dodge and they don't know how to be a turnip.  College students are boring.

      I think there are two different Me's.  There's the Daytime Me, who is happy and wants to craft and nap and is generally in a good mood.  Then there's the Nighttime Me, who's ugly head appears around 6 p.m.  The Nighttime Me hates everyone and everything and is very lonely and cries a lot.  The Nighttime Me has an insatiable hunger, disapproves of everything and is as likely to stop a behavior just as quickly as it started.    The Nighttime Me has got to go.  ** Quote of the Day ** "I'm drunk like Mrs. Lenz." -- Abby

      I have been living alone for nearly six days now.  I started to talk to myself on the second day (no surprise there), but I found myself answering back yesterday.  Perhaps solitude isn't what I need right now.    But a hot chocolate chip cookie might just do the trick.

      If I met Athena, the original goddess of knitting, I would challenge her sorry Athenian butt to a duel.  We would deftly weave vibrant tapestries, hers telling the story of suitors trying to dismantle Penelope and Odyseus' marriage bed, mine relating a most excellent summer spiked with independence and extreme exhaustion.  She would win, of course, because nobody beats Athena (without being turned into a spider, that is).  But it would be great just to have tried.

      I can't wait to go home next weekend.  I've been studying since 11:30 a.m.  I studied yesterday from 3-9 p.m.  I studied Friday from 5-9 p.m.  I am sick of studying.  I feel like such a moron because my Philosophy of War and Peace class makes absolutely no sense.  People waste our time by fighting with my teacher instead of asking questions.  The readings are written by people who collectively swallowed a thesaurus.  I freaking hate it.  Write like you talk, people.  And if you talk like that, you don't have any friends.  I also studied Media Planning this afternoon, which was a nice break.  I do, actually, heart media planning.  I do not heart people who freak out when they don't understand it and then confuse my teacher, which in turn confuses all of us.    I called some kid at my house an asshole last night.  I will continue studying until...until a long time from now.  I'm babysitting the Purdie girls, so that will be a nice break.    All I  really  want to do is knit.  If you want to make me happy, give me a job where I can knit knit knit all day long.  I've found these AMAZING knitting blogs.  I will pass them on to you soon.  Even if you don't like knitting, they have great visuals and stories.  Knitters and crocheters definitely have the most intricately woven hearts.  We also have dry hands because the fibers suck the moisture out of our skin.  A small price to pay for tactile bliss.

      Dilemma.  Do I study or take a nap?  Because I'm really tired.  And I studied last night.    I think I just answered that question myself.  So I'll nap and then study and then study some more.    Last night was one of the greatest nights I've had in a long time.  Old friends are the best friends.

      I love living with Chrissy Mayer for the following reasons: She is a very good gymnast. She loves to dance. She's "intense" about school even though she's by far the smartest person I have ever met. She's a princess. She makes mean chocolate chip cookies.  There is nothing better than sitting around your kitchen table on a Wednesday night with your awesome roommates, hating school and eating everything in the house.  It's times like that which make you realize how lucky you are to be living with two of your favorite people.  I love the late nights when we just sit around and eat.  That's what makes this house a home.  (Not a crazy person's home, not like that, although we are rather insane.)  P's making the big trip to Chicago with my dad tomorrow.  My mom is already there, shopping her little heart out.  Just what they need - more furniture.  I tell you, they really  are  running a furniture store in the basement.  P's never been to Chicago before.  I hope she likes it.  Chrissy is currently having a fashion show for her mom.  I feel like playing some RuPaul.  My dad said that I sound really happy.  I am.  Extremely.  Too many reasons to count.  But you can bet that Justin picking me up from work, a clean room (alas, not self-cleaning), Twain's crispitos and Jon Sessions all have something to do with it.    I need to fake an agenda now.

      For reasons I shouldn't have to explain, I am very glad that I no longer live in a building cleaned by a man named "Big Jim."  That is, unless Abby is willing to change her name and fulfill her life-long dream of becoming a man.  A manly man.  A man who tromps through the snow-covered woods (golf course) pulling a Bronco (red plastic sled) behind himself chanting, "Men men men men, men men men men."  That, my friends, was...good lord.  Five years ago.  Back when we were carousing with Puritans and a very small boy named Matt Keller.  How long have I known Abby?  Hold on, I need fingers to figure this out.  Eleven years.  Wow.  That's more than half my life.  It's nice to think that I've spent more than half my life knowing her.  And it'll always be more than half my life.  Someday it'll be, like 7/8 of my life.  That's my happy thought for the day.  Oh, and my hero for the day is Sylvia, the Johnston Hall Coordinator.  She is exceedingly prompt and very nice to boot.

      Much love and gratitude to the good people (not a typo) at Parking and Transportation Services.  Here's why: I tried to park in my normal lot this morning, RC15, right behind Mark Twain.  Lo and behold, the parking lot is full and there are about 20 facilities vehicles parked illegally.  What the hey?  So I call Parking and tell them and ask "Where should I park?  I don't want to get in trouble."  And they tell me to go to Conley and that I won't get a ticket.  Hurrah!!!  Goal: Finish knitting the baby blanket by Sunday night.  Everyone hold me to this, okay?  Okay.  Things I wish: 1. That my parents would come visit. 2. That Penny would come visit. 3. That I had a piece of chocolate this minute. 4. That I did not have two tests this coming Monday. 5. That my room was self-cleaning, just like the oven. 6. That I got to see Justin today.  I miss him. 7. That Kate Jeffries would call me to schedule a date. 8. That Abby's birthday was NOW so I could give her her present. 9. That my feet weren't cold. 10. That I really COULD be the Homecoming police.  Somebody make me a badge, or else I'll cite you for pomping more than 770 square feet of your house decoration.  So take THAT.

      Listen, idiot boy in my Philosophy of War and Peace class.  I'm freaking GLAD you're in the army.  I'm glad you see the army as a "gentleman's profession."  The gentlemen I know, however, don't KILL PEOPLE.  I hope someone shoots you just so I don't have to listen to you tell everyone how cool war is and fight with my teacher instead of reviewing for the test.  THANK YOU for completely WASTING my Monday morning, jackass.  And to your little redneck friend sitting on the floor, the "hippies" who drive "electric cars" and "conserve energy" are going to kick your sorry ass.  In other news, my media planning class is going to Chipolte for lunch today.  Ole!

      In the spirit of avoiding homework, here's a scary story for all you youngsters out there.  First off, my parents have more friends than I do.  This group of hellions is known as  urlLink "The Gang."   The Gang gets together every Friday night to cause trouble at some Quad-Cities' hangout.  It consists of six couples - The Emmersons, the Lenzes, the Lauritsens, the Kipps, the Bereskins and, of course, my parents.  Two of those people were once my teachers.  Four are parents of my friends.  One is a bearded lady.  Anyway, The Gang was at my house Friday night, having a pizza party and nuclear martinis.  At this party, the following things happened: 1. My mother called to ask me if my sleepover was loud, but it turned out she was louder. 2. Penny Lane took a beer out of the cooler and dropped it at the back door for the boys (because the boys and girls never hang out together - when they're in a restaurant, they sit at opposite ends of the table).  She's a multi-talented dog. 3. My mother sang and danced in the family room, supposedly by herself. 4. My dad told her to "settle down."  She's a wild woman, my mother.  Now don't think my dad isn't without his own problems - he's painting the floor of our garage to look like a showroom for his Audi TT.  (Yes, we realize he's the coolest person in the world.  Yes, it's hard to live up to his greatness.  No, I will not help clean the garage when I come home in two weeks.)    Since we're talking about the people who spawned me, here's a top 10 list of Buel family moments: 1. "Kristin Buel's All-Request Hour," which consists of me singing the tribal part of Paul Simon's  Graceland  at the top of my lungs.  2. The three of us spending the night in a bed with two pillows after arriving in Chicago at 4 a.m. during the "Storm of the Century."  My mom had no coat, I was sunburned from the Mexico sun, and my dad yelling at us to be quiet in the bed at Howard Johnson's.  Then he said "Goodnight, Johnboy," and my mom laughed so hard she almost fell out of bed.  3. Even though I wasn't there, the "Strangers in the Night" story.  My parents got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.  The lights were off, and when they came back, they ran smack into each other, full force.  My dad started singing "Strangers in the Night."  4. Trying to find Rigazzi's in St. Louis every Christmas Eve.  Here's a tip: DON'T take Elizabeth.  5. Teaching Penny how to swim.  6. Watching movies in the basement.  My mom can't work the DVD player and my dad has to make sure we have the right English setting.  Penny crawls onto my lap but leaves one paw on the floor because then she's technically still on the ground.  7. Trying to climb the icy driveway after bowling league.  My dad finally had to get a hose from the garage to help me and my mom get up the rest of the way.  8. Watching Maggie (and now Penny) opening her Christmas presents.  9. Thanksgiving morning: Mom gets up at the buttcrack of dawn to start cooking, Dad works in the basement and I play with the dog.  The parade comes on and Dad and I watch it.  We eat Thanksgiving dinner in about 10 minutes and then go to a movie and have pie when we come home.  It's my favorite day.  And my favorite moment: 10. Coming home.  Everyone cries, even the dog.

      If I had to add up all the good times I've had and divide it among the friends I have, the times with Abby would be disproportionately greater.  Not because we have known each other the longest of any of my friends (we have), not because we know how to have fun better than anyone else (but we kind of do, as long as it involves eating and Nintendo), but Abby is a pirate.  Pirates make me laugh.  In honor of yesterday being National Talk Like a Pirate Day, a tribute to Cap'n O (with much love from Admiral Eyecandy).  10. "Hitting the deck" in an Indianola, IA, hotel, when there were boys being frogs outside of our room.  9. Her never-ending war with nasty Jason Walters.  8. Sombrero in our bed.  7. The Jem backpack (AND matching fanny pack).  6. Breaking up with our best-friend-boyfriends on the same day without planning it.  5. When Stevie Wonder takes over her body and she has to "feel her surroundings."  4. Eating one cake a week in the attempt to be a combined weight of 300 lbs.  3. Putting the skirt of a formal dress over her head.  2. Being the Paul McCartney to my Michael Jackson on the way to and from Iowa.  1. The Annie Get Your Gun theater spectacular.

      I am angry.  I am angry because I fell down in the street today and cut my arm, knee and hip.  I am angry because I waited for two hours for Justin and Vox still wouldn't let him go.  I am angry because MY CRAZY TEACHER MAKES ME TURN IN MY HOMEWORK ON THE INTERNET AND THE INTERNET IS A FREAKING PIECE OF CRAP AND NEVER WORKS.   I still don't feel any better.  The Wilco concert was fun last night.  Not the greatest concert of my life, but far, far, FAR from the worst.  During a particularly long, slow song, I was trying to come up with my favorite concert moments of all time.  Here they are, in no particular order (except one):  * Screaming "Ohmygod, there he is!" at the top of your lungs at an *NSYNC concert before the show starts and watching all the little girls freak out.  * Dancing to "Hot Legs" with my mom at Rod Stewart.  * Seeing 112, more commonly known as "One-one-two."  * The freak of nature that is Steve Fatone.  "Hootie-hoo!"  * Seeing the F-word in all its flaming (really, it was on fire) glory at the Blink-182 concert.  * Meeting the girls who drive the *NSYNC winnebago.  * Every single time Abby gets the binoculars, some sort of explosion happens on stage and she is blinded for the next 10 minutes.  * The almost-fight between 14 year-old smokers and Dream fans at the 2001 *NSYNC concert at Soldier Field.  * Annie eating all of her candy before we even get to the concert.  * The *NSYNC boys WAVING TO ME AND ANNIE from just 10 feet away and we knew Abby would die when she heard about it.  ...and the best moment of all time... * July 23, 2001.  We got the *NSYNC Celebrity CD at 12:01 a.m. at Wal-Mart (kind of took it out of the shipping boxes before we were supposed to), listened to the CD all day at work.  Went to the Janet Jackson concert that night.  Melissa drove.  We sang every word to the new CD and Abby and I danced in the back seat.  We did the "Pop" video and were Celebrity demons while Melissa tried to find a parking spot for more than 20 minutes.  Favorite phrase of the night "If I didn't have cheese, like, ev-er-y day."  That was the best night of my whole entire life.  I'm not angry anymore.

      Did you know that I can't get drunk?  It's physically impossible.  Just can't do it.  And drinking a lot (well, a lot for me) is pointless because you get really sleepy and then have to get up and go to the bathroom.  What a waste.  I'll stick with cookies.  I am a knitting goddess, just like Athena.  Kicked that sorry thing's butt, I did.  Make it and take it out twice, that's what I always say.  I wish Melissa would send me more fleece pants.  I love them.

      Today...today made me want to chop off my own legs and look just like my bear, CB.  He had an unfortunate Abby-related accident last week in which she pulled off one of his legs.  I looked at the other leg to see how to reattach it, but took off the other leg in the process.  He is now wrapped up in one of my dad's button down short-sleeve shirts (a Chuck Buel classic that I stole in 8th grade) with strips of cloth tied around his middle, holding his legs in place.  He really is in the worst traction I have ever seen.  (And if you didn't figure it out, he's named after the original CB - Chuck B.)  Anyway.  Today.  Long.  Work.  Class.  Work.  Ad Club.  Babysitting.  More work.  Grocery shopping.  Whee.   Things other people learned today which I already knew well in advance:  1. Everyone in the J-School is on crack.  (Kathy, my boss) 2. Justin is indecisive.  (Justin) 3. There really ARE cats in America and the streets AREN'T filled with cheese.  (Fievel)  In the words of the great William Lichter ( Can't Hardly Wait ), "I can't feel my legs.  I have no legs."

      So instead of going to the football game I saw an excellent movie and ate toasted ravioli with friends.  We then studied.  As the drunkards rolled onto LaMesa, someone looked into our window and went "Dude!  Those girls are studying!"  No shit, communications major.  We will also be graduating in under six years, unlike yourself.   Things I am glad I am not:  A polyester bride. Hungry. A sea hag.  I bought some art today.  Ragtag has this amazing artist featured this month and he does near-impressions of album covers and city streets and lots of casinos.  I wanted the Alicia Keys painting, but it was already reserved by Zola's dad (Matt Agnew and Zola, what are you doing?) so I got the No Doubt painting.  Twelve dollars, people.  Twelve dollars.  Amazing.  It'll look super in my room.  Big Mar's gonna have to show me a good place to put it in my room.  Speaking of Big Mar, she was added to Justin's cell phone today as he was looking up "chicks" he knows.  She's the biggest chick of them all.  How he could go so long without her phone number I'm not sure.  She is, after all, the BOE (Boss of Everyone for those of you who haven't encountered her reign of terror).   The cutest story ever about my dog:  My parents were goin' out with the gang (el gang in Spanish) last night and hadn't fed Penn.  They left her food in her bowl and didn't put her in her cage.  When they came home, she had eaten all of her dinner and put herself to bed in the cage.  She is the best dog in the whole entire world.  She should send me presents (not socks, that's my job).

      Update on the car situation: Joe Machen is what we like to call a bastard.  Greedy bastard, at that.  One-thousand dollars to fix my car?  I better get fries with that.  Everyone has been so awesome giving me rides and stuff.  Special thanks to Abby for loaning me Senior (not to be confused with Junior) and taking me to class.  Thanks to Colleen for hauling my car-less butt across town when I discovered I couldn't pick up my car.  And thanks to Jen and Stacy for taking me home the other night.  I hate having to ask for rides and you ladies have been the best.  If you didn't notice, the boyfriend wasn't mentioned.  That's because he's still infected with a virus.  But he's taking me to pick up my car tonight.  So thanks in advance, buddy.  In other news... Today one of my teachers was wearing the following outfit: A navy blue and white striped t-shirt.  A flaming pink (think magenta on acid) blazer.  Maroon velvet pants.  Does anyone see a problem with this?  I very nearly died every time she stepped out from behind her table.  Nice lady, but a mite color blind.  Big props to Kate Jeffries for playing white trash better than anyone I know.    Ladybird - I hear you have new pictures of P.  Send 'em my way.

      Today has been officially the worst day of my life.  I managed to keep good humor throughout most of it and I kept all homicidal rage to myself.  Drumroll, please: 1. My car is broken.  The power steering has just decided it's done it's duty and went AWOL.  2. I won't get paid for the News Bureau until the end of the month because it's too late to add me to the payroll.  3. The university tried to charge me more than DOUBLE of what my actual bill turned out to be.  4. My garage has a lot of water in it because the boys next door didn't hook their washing machine hose to the wall.  Their garage is now filled with cardboard boxes, water and a keg.  5. I can't get on the network at the News Bureau.  Even the computer guy can't fix it.  6. Justin has the flu.  If he liked soup and if I had a car that turned corners without the help of gladiators, I would bring him some.  I think there's more but I'm trying to erase it from memory.  I did, however, get to try Rold Gold Honeywheat pretzels.  Two thumbs waaaaay up.  Now I must read Nancy Drew.

      I am a good person.  I went to Office Depot to get portfolio stuff and as I walked out, I realized that my bill was way too low.  I hadn't been charged for something.  So I went back in and waited in line so I could  pay more money .  (Yeah, I know.  I don't think I'm really an American, either.)  The cashier proceeds to have a breakdown in front of everyone, slamming the cash register drawer.  Coins flew everywhere.  Her manager just stared at her.  Finally, it was my turn and I told her that I didn't pay enough.    I don't know what that all means, but I'm slightly disgusted with myself.

      I taught 15 people how to crochet tonight and my head is all jumbled up now.  I need to do homework before  FM Nation , but really, I don't think I could sit still long enough to read about theories of war.  Roxy update: Her tank is clean, she's officially not dead but still incredibly mad at me.  Penny update: Ate a hole in her new bed.  She's in big trouble.  Dad update: Still in the garage drywalling.  He brought in a heater so he doesn't freeze to death.  Mom update: Enormous  urlLink television star .  It's a wonder she still accepts my phone calls.  Elvis update: Still dead.

      You didn't  really  think I lost my portfolio, did you?  Silly you.  I found it in a box at the back of my closet (which is about 10 feet long, so things get lost there a lot).  I did, however, look in my sock drawer before that.

      We just had an aquatic emergency.  I was cleaning Roxy's tank because it had all these gross floaty things in it, so I put her and her old water into a Shakespeare's cup.  She was not pleased.  In fact, I thought she was dead because she didn't move at all.  I changed the water and the rocks, let it sit for a half hour and then tried to get her back in.  I put a plastic bag on my hand so she wouldn't bite me (she's a fighting fish, okay?) and she finally fell onto my gloved hand as I poured out the water and then jumped onto the counter.  She flopped around for a second before I could get her into the tank.  Now she officially hates me.  (But she seems to be doing just fine.)  I think I lost my portfolio.  Which isn't really a big deal since there wasn't anything in it, but I would kind of like ot know where it is so I can start putting things in it for my senior interview in two weeks.  Did I leave it at home?  It's big and black.  It's gotta be here  somewhere .  I'm going to sleep with one eye open tonight so a certain fish doesn't get her revenge.

      I'm reading a book called "The Fierce Beauty Club," and it's one of those books that you have to stop reading every few pages becuase you need to think and take it all in.  It's about women from different generations forming a group to talk about women's issues that eventually becomes a group of friends.  I never considered myself a "feminist" until I was put into a group of women who were supposed to be.  LSV is known as a group of women fighting for women, although after my year of service, it seems that the group has evolved from the original intent of the early 1900s into women fighting for people in general.  Yesterday morning was our annual Homecoming Alumni Brunch, and even though there weren't a whole lot of people there, it gave me so much perspective of how lucky I am to be a woman at this very moment.  Women couldn't leave the dorms after 9 p.m.  They were not allowed to be with a man without an escort.  Until 1965, LSV wasn't revealed on Tap Day because it was a "man's tradition."  If it wasn't for the women in the previous classes, I wouldn't even be able to run for student government on this campus (that is, if I wanted to).  I wouldn't be able to leave my room without telling someone.  I wouldn't be able to wear pants in public.  So I'm thankful for those women and for the legacy they have left us.  Most of all, I'm thankful for being given the chance to rediscover female friendships.  I don't think any of us in our group had an abundance of close female friends - we didn't realize that it was a necessity for survival and sanity because we were too busy being "involved" and being "leaders" to have close girl friends.  The service we did was good, something I am proud of, but that's not what I'll remember sixty years from now when I go to my Homecoming 2062 Brunch.  I'll remember the sleepover, the Easter candy, our last night on the Quad and closing down Dairy Queen.  I'll remember wedding plans, my first tour of a sorority house and pretending to be FBI agents.  I'll remember having to wait in a closet on Tap Day because we didn't seem to deserve a real room and everyone being nervous and sad and happy all at the same time.  I'll remember Mary, Katie, Leann, Alana, Jessica and Natalie.  I'll remember my sisters.

      Last night was super.  It was the most fun I've had in quite awhile.  So I still hate Homecoming, but that is totally canceled out by the fact that I'm in love with one of my best friends (not you, Abby.  Although it was lovely sleeping with you - we haven't done that for awhile.).     I'm up because the Petersen clan is going to the parade.  And I'm about to be back down because I don't need to be anywhere until 11.

      I have never liked Homecoming.  It's not a Mizzou thing.  I've hated it ever since I was a middle schooler sitting on "the hill" at the Homecoming football game, eyeing the hot high school boys and hoping someone my own age would notice me.  I feel like it's high school all over again.  It's raining (because it ALWAYS rains on Homecoming no matter what state I'm in), I don't have a date for the dance (and if I do, it's because  I  asked  him  because no boy in his right mind would ask me) and after the dance I go home and sit on the couch with my parents because there really isn't anything else to do.  Once, when I did have a date I really liked, he started dating a girl that ANOTHER boy had started dating after going out with me a few times.  She had a French last name and a face like a horse but the boys still came a runnin'.  The only good part of Homecoming is the marching bands.  And after promoting Homecoming for the University for weeks, I felt like it was going to be a great time and actually be fun.  Oh hopes, what have we told you before?  Don't get too high or your little hearts will be broken.  So you can understand why I'm slightly irritable.

      Tuesday is my new favorite day of the week thanks to  FM Nation .  God, I love that show.  Last night we were magically whisked away to Boulder, CO, where we went to a high school "party," heard a band play to raise money for their friend's bail money, and experienced two drunk girls' last night at college.  It was a beautiful thing.  It's been decided that when we graduate, Chrissy will write for  Sabrina the Teenage Witch  and I will work at MTV so I can meet the fabulous people they put on  FM Nation  (hopefully I'll get to meet Porky first).  Chrissy and Abby's love of  7th Heaven  freaks me out but I can't help but watch.  For the record, Mary is a slut.  We saw an old one last night where she was just becoming a slut.  It's like watching her grow up all over again.  And who is Jimmy Moon and why does Abby keep screaming his name?  I was confused and thought he was Jimmy Ray of the "Are you Jimmy Ray?" song.  I was very wrong.  I am highly in favor of  urlLink Clare's  blog.  It's a highlight of my day.  I also endorse:  urlLink Owls  from Martha Stewart.  Ours are named Hoot, Holler, Kitten and Spook. Clark's new 'do. Feminism Eating  Another thing about Martha Stewart: Anyone who actually thinks they're going to send Martha to jail is crazy.  You don't send Martha to jail.  She will kill you.  I have a healthy amout of respect and fear for Martha, as should anyone afraid of a crazed woman with gardening shears.  Martha, OJ, it's all the same.

      It's official - the first-ever Knit & Crochet Out is ON.  Mark your calendars - Saturday, Nov. 2, 1-4 p.m. in the Friends Room at the Columbia Public Library.  I'm really nervous.  I hope people show up.  Today has been the best day EVER.  No work, got up 2 hours later than usual, only had one real class, got to go the library, home to eat Puppy Chow ala Abby and decorate for Halloween (don't look in our pantry - it's scary).  I also got to see Justin twice and play with Amy.  Do days get any better than this?  Only when I'm in Iowa.  AND I saw Ruth, my camp counselor buddy.  Best day ever.

      I have my first knitting-induced injury - a blister on the outside of my right pointer finger.  (Do you remember the song "Where is Thumbkin?"  I used to really like that song.)  It hurts a lot, so I bandaged it and I'm ready to continue jabbing needles into yarn.  It's a weird work week for me - one of my bosses is gone all week and it's Homecoming, so my schedule is whacked out at the News Bureau.  I'm not working tomorrow (at all - at either job - can you believe it?) and I'm working all day Friday at the News Bureau so I can tag along on media lunches and the Tiger Plaza unveiling.  I hope they are as exciting as I tried to make them in the press releases.  The best way to get me to eat fruit is to put it in dessert.  My parents are in Flordia visiting my grandparents, and Helene is babysitting Penny at home.  I find all of this grossly unfair as it is 90 degrees in Florida and Penny doesn't have to go to school (because she flunked).  Then again, she has to go to the bathroom in the backyard, so maybe I shouldn't complain.  I dreamt I was trying on prom dresses.  I also had this crazy dream where Rob Coons and I were driving through Des Moines to get to St. Louis (don't ask) in a car that had a steering wheel on each side.  We would take turns driving and I was peeling apples in the car.  We were going to pick up my friend from high school, Chris Bradley, at her school (which, in reality, is in California, but I guess in my dream it was Des Moines), but when we called her it turned out she was on spring break.  Then all of a sudden Rob wasn't in the car anymore, but Justin was and it was raining.  And I had to have labels on my gas and break pedals because I always forget which is which.  I don't think we ever made it to St. Louis (especially not if we were going through Des Moines - that places is like the 9th circle of hell and the Bermuda Triangle all mixed up into one).  I take offense at  urlLink Caleb  saying that Iowa is a terrible place.  Pella is a terrible place (they make  windows  there, people.  That's all.), but Iowa, as a whole, is a lovely place to live.  It's just that Caleb was in Central Iowa, where all of the homely people of the world live.  Trust me on this one - I've spent quite a bit of time in Central Iowa.  I think I would rather live in Iowa than Missouri.  There isn't much different between the two, but I really hate I-70 and the rivers aren't as pretty down here.  And does the Missouri State Penetentiary have a public mini-golf course on it's property?  I think not.

      I have started a new blanket.  The slippers didn't go so well - they were a mite too large and wee bit too ugly.  Actually, I only made one.  So I'm going to fill it with potpourri and use it as a doorstop.  The new blanket is knit and what I call "diangular," meaning you make it on the diagonal.  It's fun.  I'm just using scraps and then I'll give it to Binky Patrol.  I have the happiest fish in the world.  I missed Thursday night TV tonight because I was schmoozing with an Ad Club speaker and his really cool high school daughter - she was really fun to talk to.  What happened on Will and Grace?   urlLink Some   urlLink people  don't know how to program their VCR, so I missed it.

Look at Pat Healy - he could become President and would just tell people he was helping out the country.  He is an amazing man.  The knitting blogs are making my fingers itch.  I want to craft but I must study!  Nooooo!  They have reinforced my love of yarn and thin alumninum (wonder metal!) rods.  Am I becoming like my dad and his Audi TT webring?

      Will someone please ask IATS why we all of a sudden have to change our webmail passwords to something containing (1) at least one capital, (2) at least one lowercase letter and (3) a number?  My old password was fine, thank you.  In awesome news, I advanced to the next stage of one of my job applications - as in, they accepted it and asked me more questions.  I could end up in Miami though.  I don't know how I feel about that.  Besides, I can't actually take a job until May, and all available jobs will be gone by then.  Right?

      An alarmingly large number of people get to this website by searching for "Playboy Girls of the Big 12."  How odd.  Although, according to my astigmatism-inflicted boyfriend (who has a calendar of me (fully clothed) in his room), I put all those girls to shame.  How true.   I  at least have the decency to keep my clothes on when on campus.  I'm itching to start a new project but can't really move to do it.  I want to make myself some slippers because I find it ridiculous to buy things I can just make myself.  In fact, I find it ridiculous to buy things.  Spending money makes me feel bad.  Unless I'm spending money on other people.  Or Penny.  While I'm thinking of it, things to get P for Christmas: 1. Socks  That pretty much exhausts my options.  Roxy is a lot happier now that I moved her into my room.  We talk when I come home from work and class.  It's nice to have someone to talk to.  I can tell she's getting sleepy because she just kind of flutters her tail and drifts around.  But she's a wild woman in the morning.  Best thing I said all day: "Some people don't believe in God; she doesn't believe in Gay." -- about a friend I used to have in high school  Most inspirational advice I have ever heard: "Having sex is like riding a bike.  Every time they do it, I'm there." -- a very sad and scarring story told by one Frank Butler  I wish October would end so I could get Chris off my wall.  He looks like he's constipated and I'm not really down with that.  Next month is...ooo, all of *NSYNC with especially ugly hair.  I think my love for *NSYNC has waned a bit in the past few months.  That whole Lance going to space thing kinda threw me off.  But the thing that really messed me up was the whole Justin/Britney breakup.  I liked each of them considerably less after that.  She's stupid because he's too hot to cheat on and yet she did.  And then there was that whole "Boys Remix" video that really bit the big one.  He's stupid because...because...he's not stupid, he's just hot.  Hot and wishing he was from the 'hood.  Hey, Justin - you're hot!  You don't need anything else!  (But I do listen to his song all the time because it is very Michael Jackson  Thriller  and the kid can dance - I can picture it in my head.)  But the obsession is pretty much over and, for the first time in my life, I'm a one-Justin woman.  It feels good.  On a side note, my mother swears she can plan a wedding in less than six months and is gunning to try.  Any takers?

I got to dance, hang out with my good friend Amy (who is currently in "playa" training) and meet some new people.  Deja Vu was cra-azy.  It was Mardi Gras night and I won a t-shirt and some beads for dancing on the dry bar (we were by far the most sober people up there all night).  I also saw a lot of breasts during the "Win a Spring Break Trip" contest.  Those girls were definitely not sober.  The girl who won was the bride-to-be from one of three bachelorette parties.  I'm sure her husband will be proud.  I know I was.  Too much work to do.  I wonder if I should have done more yesterday instead of staying in bed until 6:00, but I don't really think so.

      I got to spend last night with my two favorite guys - my dad and my boyfriend.  It was a great night.  And I got to go to sleep early.  The bear with no legs (CB) is returned and all better.  Dr. Joan Clements fixed him up.  I hope his insurance covers it.  I just applied for a job.  A  real  job.  Like, a big person's job.  Sigh.  I don't really like this.

      I made the mistake of telling Abby where my School House Rocks videos were.  Everything I know about grammar, science and math I learned from School House Rocks.  Also most everything I know about America, with the exception of how many bigots there are in the world, especially my Philosophy of War and Peace class.  Lolly lolly lolly.  Speaking of said class, we watched  Full Metal Jacket  today.  Talk about intense.  The ROTC boys were very excited, especially when Gomer Pyle shot himself in the head.  What's your function?  I have a fish of my very own now.  Her name is Roxy.  She, like Rio, is a fighting fish.  She has a black head and a body that gradually morphs from dark blue to teal.  She's so beautiful.  She wriggles her tail and the light shimmers off into a rainbow.  I could watch her for hours.  We put the two fish tanks next to each other and Roxy and Rio both got really pissed.  Roxy's head puffed up.  We are not doing that again.  You can buy tanks that connected so they can look at each other but can't get to each other and I guess they're just pissed off all the time.  Hold on, I'm going to scare Abby.  ("Interjections" is on and it's my very favorite song.  We used to sing it at football games in high school just to make everyone mad.)  My haircut is okay.  Not stellar.  Daryl (yes, my hair stylist's name is Daryl) kept leaving to answer the phone.  HUGE hugs and thanks to Joanna for allowing me to borrow her hair dryer for a few minutes.  She is a star.  Now I will sleep at my boyfriend's house (no!  The sin!  Call the elders!) while he stays up all night to write a paper.  It's been awhile since I've done this and I'm wondering if I can still sleep with all the lights on.  We shall soon find out.

       urlLink This  pretty much explains everything.  Scroll down to Oct. 2, the second post.  I painted a pumpkin at the News Bureau today.  We interns are a hard working bunch (no, really, Tish told us to do it!).  Mine looks like a cat.  It started off as a mouse but things went awry rather quickly.  Three cheers for: Sarah, for bringing us scrumdidiliumptious cookies Amy, for planning my life so I can busy myself with mailing lists about nutrition Yoga, for causing me to fall asleep before I eat my dinner Justin, for being gainfully employed Mom, for not having mentioned my hair in the past 48 hours (although we haven't actually talked for the past 24) Doing a phone survey of the 65202 zip code and the only person that will answer my questions about exercise is an 83 year-old woman who likes to walk.  Not exactly our target audience of 25-35 year-olds, but it'll do.  Chuck B will be in da house Friday night, so if you want to hang out with us (I think we're going to the Berg and we are DEFINITELY adjusting my hot water heater), give me a call.  I warn the good citizens of the Quad Cities USA that Marilyn Buel will be on her own with the gang Friday night and has been known to be quite the rabble rouser.  I'd visit me, too.

      In the immortal words of Abby Peterson, it's colder than a butt out there.  On Sunday, I thought I had everything under control.  School was going well, I was finally caught up with reading after my week of tests, everything seemed to be in good shape.  Suddenly I'm faced with decisions about my future and THEN I realize I still have a whole lot of crap to do this week.  I also need to finish Dave Barry's newest novel to send back with my dad on Saturday and I need to finish a binky for a baby that was born eight weeks early.  Being one myself, I know how important this blanket is.  I also want to finish my blanket for Kathy's little girl.  And I MUST watch  urlLink FM Nation , the greatest show ever given to us by MTV.  Last week it featured a boy named Porky.  How cool is that?  If you haven't read last Thursday's Vox, do it just for Julie's amazing article.  I, too, owned a My Little Pony Sleeping bag.

      I am currently in a lot of pain.  I have repeated-use stress syndrome or something, I don't know what it's called, all I know is that it hurts more than getting your head stepped on by Penny (which happens more often than you think).  It's usually in my right hand, as I am right handed and tend to use said hand quite a bit for writing and stirring and turning the ignition in my car (sometimes bones pop out of place when I do that and that really sucks).  But it's my left hand.  Which is odd, because I didn't even drive with my left hand today.  I am a right-handed driver.  It feels like someone is pinching every nerve in my wrist, stretching all of the tendons and other little stringy things from my fingers through my elbows.  I want to scream or cry, I don't know which.  It could possibly be from knitting (which I haven't done a lot of lately, come to think of it).  Pinching things really messes up my wrists.  All I know is that it hurts just to hold a book or make a fist.  I wonder how old I will be when I get surgery for it, after I can't move any of my fingers and am forced to keep my wrists in braces.  I wonder how long it will take to heal.  I used to get upset  knowing that someday my arms will be split down the middle with a tiny knife, stuff will be pushed around and I'll be sewn up like a ragged hem.  Now I just wonder what it looks like inside.  Add "Underwear Thief" to Penny's long list of occupations.  My computer decided to pitch a fit tonight and mysteriously not recognize Windows.  After almost an hour on the phone with tech support, I got it working.  My good mood from being home had been ruined.  I think I will reignite it with some of Abby's birthday cake.  I had an awesome weekend.  I definitely needed to just chill out and tease the dog and not think about school.  It was a good rest.  I got a bunch of new clothes for work and got ridiculed BY MY OWN MOTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIMITED about how bad my hair looks.  Every time I came out of the dressing room in a new outfit, she would say, "The clothes look good but your hair looks terrible."  Earlier in the weekend, I was repeatedly called a Wookie.  Did I not predict that when I went home she would tell me to cut it?  Well, Lady, at least  I  don't look like Rod Stewart.  Send the camera with Dad Thursday to see how it looks.

      I've been home for three and a half hours and already the dog is in big trouble.  We went to the biggest dive of a bar in town (The Valley Inn, I love it) and came home to find Penny eating my sunglasses.  Mmm, sunglasses.  She mangled one arm and bit a hole through the lens.  I would be mad except that I'm kind of impressed and they were from Wal-Mart anyway.  The trumpets are blaring, the elephants are stomping and the carnies are coming to town because...my mom has a  urlLink blog !  Can you even wait?  (If you are a gay black man, I apologize in advance because this is how she sometimes refers to herself.  The 70s were hard on all of us.)  I am so glad to be home.  I spent all of dinner talking with my dad.  We played pinball and were pretty terrible.  And my mom is so funny.  She won't let my dad read her blog because he is "weird about stuff."  That's like calling the kettle dirty and burned.  Penny is still in "the doghouse" (hanging her head while she stares mournfully at my dad) and my mom and I are conquering the Internet.  I'm glad things don't change.

      Little has been accomplished today.  I'm trying to read a Judy Bolton novel for my Girl Sleuths class, and lemme tell ya, she's no Nancy Drew.  She's freaking  married , people.  How can you be solving crimes and saving the day when you've got some weenie guy hanging on your arm?  (Although, her husband  is  an FBI agent and isn't around much, but still, come on...let's think about Ned Nickerson, the most worthless character in fiction.)  Anyway, Judy sucks.  Plus, I had to pay $25 for her book while Nancy's books are only $6 and much, much better.    Coming to a computer near you - Marilyn Buel's blog.  You will either thank me or hate me for helping her with it this weekend.  But I firmly believe that she is the funniest person I have ever met (as does she), so I'm sure it will be a blog worth reading.  Ooo, we have a fish here.  A real one, not glass.  Abby got him for her birthday.  Don't tell our landlords.  His name is Rio, named after Jem's boyfriend.  He's a beta - a fighting fish.  He's blue and purple, just like Rio's hair.  He tried to fight one of the glass fish.  Abby keeps getting him all riled up.  She is a bad influence.  All my gal friends - are you intersted in getting the coolest shirt ever?  Go  urlLink here .  If we buy a dozen, we can get a pretty good discount.  Thanks to Jen for showing me the wonder that is Northern Sun.

      BDI, CDI, my oh my.    I do not have the strength nor the will to do homework.  I find it terribly unjust that we are expected to read two chapters immediately following a test.  It take me at least three days to dump all that information out of my head so I can put more in.  In other news, I am now the proud owner of a RED cell phone.  Sex-kitten red, even.  It's not a new phone, just a new cover.  It kind of looks like nailpolish.  If I can ever get my stupid homework done, I will craft.  Oh, and in case there was any doubt, I have the best boyfriend in the whole entire world.

      The people in this house must not have any nerve endings left because it is so cold that I can see my breath.  I had to sleep with FIVE blankets on my bed last night, plus a t-shirt, sweatshirt with a hood and pajama pants.  IT IS COLD.  Turn up the damn heat.  I don't really feel like writing a lot because there are video games to play and ads to avoid creating, plus a nap hovering in the future.  But I really like: * Muppets * The hat I finished yesterday * Sleeping in front of the fireplace * Bounce Out, the best game on Yahoo! * Having 7/8 of my holiday shopping complete.  Hoo-rah.

      I shouldn't be allowed to write on this thing afer midnight because I'm not always thinking straight past the ten o'clock news, but whatever.  There's no chance of sleeping because Penny is in tough dog mode, barking her little lungs out (she sounds like a St. Bernard or something - it's kind of scary) because some jackass is driving around our neighborhood with an airhorn.  Wow.  I didn't know she could howl.  I'm distracted now and don't feel like writing anything except to say I don't miss high school, I'm nothing like I used to be in high school and I can't understand why people keep trying to rehash it.  Not that I don't have good memories or great friends, but I have a new life now.  I'm done with petty games and all that crap.  I'm happy where I am, finally doing what I like and being with people who I like.  Why does that feel so wrong?

      So I didn't do any homework yesterday.  Big whoop because I'm going to do it right now, at the 8 a.m. mark.  Ab and Mitch (aka Mitchy-Mitch, Petty Theft) are coming over around 3:00.  I haven't seen Mitch in like, two years.  At least that long.  I'm a little nervous.  The Festival of Trees sucked.  The only thing it had going for it were the old men giving out candy, and I didn't even take any.  It kept my mom quiet, though.  I had a lot of fun making fun of the trees with my dad.  Our favorite one had two legs, a pair of skis and some arms coming out of it - Santa crashed into the Christmas tree.  Texas Roadhouse is a great place to eat, even greater when we put the free peanuts in my stocking cap.  Then I came home and made some Christmas presents for the masses.  If you give me your address, far-away blog friends, I will send you some of these treasures.  I watched the  Real World , but it wasn't as good without my girl KJ.  And Irulan needs some anger management classes.   The Osbournes  was so-so - I think I'm over that.  It was so not as good as  FM Nation .  I am disappointed in MTV.  Then, because I am 85, I went to bed.

      My mother is wrecking havoc on the blogging world.  From the twin's comment spot: "I don't know you--at least I don't think I do but I linked to your blog thru Justin Marciniak's. Justin is "going with" (Kristin would call that term, very middle school) my daughter, Kristin Buel. But I did enjoy reading your thoughts. Kristin introduced me to this medium and I have been blogging for almost 2 months. I am constantly confused by Justin's blog but most of your made sense to me except for the FLAVA part. What the hell is that?"  There are so many reasons (such as "going with" -- how old  are  you?) that I should be embarrassed by my own mother, but the last sentence makes me laugh so much that I am glad that we are too much alike for our own good.  Sorry to scare you,  urlLink Clare , but yeah, my mom reads your blog.  Sunday night, the disembodied voice yells from the computer room to me in the kitchen, "Who is Clare Martin?"  And I said, "She's a former FARCer with awesome hair and we used to play tricks on Adrian."  And she responded, "You should have married him."  Bringing us to the top three guys my mom thinks I should marry: 1. Hammer "The L is for Love" Lauritsen 2. Adrian (which is impossible because I am his sister) 3. Justin  Unfortunately, Adrian is already married, Hammer quotes The  Outlaw Josie Wales  on a daily basis and I am madly in love with Justin.  So too bad, Lady.  I'm awake because I had a bad dream involving a foster sister/brother, Katie down the street, acid and Abby's boyfriend.  I'm trying to forget it.  And I'm hungry.  Maybe I will go sleep with the dog for awhile.  Speaking of the dog, it turns out she's jealous of me because she's not the baby anymore.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  I get to sit with my dad on the couch, I get to sit with my mom in bed and she can't do any of it.  But she's not mad at me - she's mad at them.  I taught that dog well.  Abby came over and watched  Erin Brockovich  last night and I forgot we lived together.  It was like, Woah!  Abby!  I missed you so much!  After I wake up again, I'm going to the dentist, Michael's (for all my craft needs), and SuperTarget for grocery shopping.  The Buels (minus P) are going to the Fesitval of Trees and then to Texas Roadhouse for dinner.  It's going to be a great day.  Unfortunately, I need to spend a large chunk of it doing homework.  Damn my teachers and the horses they rode in on.

      When you are almost two, everyone wants to play with you all the time.  When you are almost two, you can sleep whenever you want.  When you are almost two, you can make someone mad and then three minutes later they love you again.  When you are almost two, you like to kiss everyone you meet.  When you are almost two, you cry when your big sister goes upstairs and you can't go too.  Penny Lane is almost two.  At this time last year she was biting hands and running away.  Now she's carrying two toys at once and watching birds out "her" window.  There never was a more wonderful dog (except Maggie, but that goes without saying.  Penny knows she will never be as good as Maggie - I tell her that at least once a day.).  Today the Buel girls (P included) went to the pet store where we met a bird that talked to Penny and some very small dogs wearing coats.  Then we came home and took naps.  Then we had lunch with Dad.  Then we took more naps.  I went to LeClaire (city motto: Don't waste your time, it's just LeClaire) with my mom to browse through some knick-knacky stores.  Then home for crocheting.  Then dinner.  Then  Sum of All Fears  and  Wet Hot American Summer  (note: parents don't really get that movie).  We went out with The Gang last night and I am definitely scarred for life.  I don't think I'll ever get to the point where I'll be able to talk about it without having a seizure.

      I'm all jittery inside.  I am so excited to go home.  I am so excited to finally get to see Justin for the first time since Sunday night.  (Well, we've  seen  each other but not been able to you know, have an extended conversation.)  I think I'm all packed for home.  You listen to me, little golden retriever: I'm only bringing enough socks home for 10 days.  So you better not get any big ideas.  I have an entire bag filled with textbooks and notebooks and another filled with "free reading" books and a hat.  Remember "free reading"?  Nanie took a class where all you did was read for the whole quarter.  I think they had to write like two book reports or something.  I totally missed out on that one.  Meanwhile, I was taking a class where my teacher would tell us all about his sex life (and his stepson was in my grade - very uncomfortable).  Ah, AP English, how you taught me nothing and didn't get me out of English 20.   Will and Grace  was so good tonight.  I especially liked the outtakes when Karen said, "I could hump a tree."  Right on, sister.

      Ladies, this one is for you:  urlLink the hottest pictures you have ever seen .  Scroll down to Wed., Nov. 13.  Mmmm.  That was the best way to start my day.  I swear you won't be disappointed.  I just wanted to let everyone know that Justin Timberlake broke his foot.  So he can't dance for awhile.  What good is he then?  (Well, I think those pictures answer that question.)  Sure, he can sing, but his songs are just so  sad .  Again I ask, what did that girl do to him?  It's like she ripped out his heart with a pitchfork and drove a John Deere tractor over it.  Good lord.  My Justin is a Slave 4 Vox.    Speaking of Britney, she's recording again.  I read this in her mother's online diary on Britney's website.  I don't have a lot of friends, you see.  And I gotta keep up with BritBrit.  I try to think of my favorite bands and I really can't (besides the obvious).  I really really really love Alicia Keys, but she's not a band.  When I think band, I think high schoolers playing Souza marches.  I dated a guy in a band once.  It was called Don't Excite the Retard (or DETR for short).  The "retard" was our friend Nic.  He would slam himself against walls.  He was also the drummer.  I know it was all terribly politically incorrect, but those boys played some mean 80s covers.  Of course, I was so uncultured back in my high school days that I thought they actually wrote "Why Don't We do it in the Road" (or whatever it's called) and that it was the funniest song I ever heard.  Maybe that's why I don't like the Beatles.  At least they didn't play Gary Neuman's "Cars."  That is the worst song EVER.

      I have one hour and fifteen minutes to write a mystery story.  Wooo!  It's all planned out because our group ROCKS.  I think I might get scared while I write it, though.  It's about an impregnating rapist and nobody else is home here.  I took a huge nap and when I woke up there was a big scary man wrestling with our furnace.  I'm not quite sure why.  I have cuts all over my hands.  Abby thinks I prune things in my sleep.  I don't really know what's going on with that.  I don't even own pruning sheers.

      Nobody who ever lived in FARC can tell me that they never had some sort of crush on  urlLink this  guy at one time or another.  I mean, let's be honest with ourselves.  I miss ya, twin.  In other New Blog News:  urlLink She  is a teacher that let me work on the newspaper during intermission in my costumes.  urlLink She  survived the basement from hell with me and is one of my favorite people. And, well, yes...still my  urlLink mother .  Best thing I heard all day:  "Listen, I don't care if you're on pills.  I'm not gonna be one of those people!" -- Amy, when I refused to skip class with her (and we are NOT still in a fight, so just get over it, okay?  I'm not afraid of you.  Or your Cheez-Its.)  I have this problem where I can't leave the library without at least six books.  I guess it's better than heroin.

      Hmmm.  Roxy is very happy now that her tank is clean.  She was not very happy when I tried to ladle her out of it.  I am on the brink of self-destruction.  I'm considering implosion or disintegration.  It's at times like these that I ask myself, "WWPD?"  (For those of you not in the know, "What Would Penny Do?")  Penny would eat something that doesn't belong to her and then take a nap somewhere she's not supposed to be.  Actually, that's the best idea I've heard all day.

      My hair is dark.  And a little shorter.  But nobody will notice that because it is dark.  I think I like it.  Abby likes it a lot.  Nobody else has seen it.  It's semi-permanent, meaning it will wash out in about a month.  So that's cool.  I think it's kind of the color that Julia Roberts has when she dyes her hair dark - was it like that in  America's Sweethearts ?  Well, whatever movie it is, it looks like that.  And it's very soft and smells very good.  When I got it cut yesterday, all the bleached stuff from camp got cut off anyway and I don't think I've seen my real hair color since high school.  I think this might be close to it - it even matches my eyebrows.  So to answer your question, yes, I got my hair cut yesterday and colored today.  I highly recommend Mia and Maxx for all of your hair needs.  Justin's in Kansas, Abby's going on a date and Chrissy disappeared last night, so it's me, a frozen pizza and a lot of yarn tonight.  I'm also planning on devouring another book.  I finished  Bookends  by Jane Green this morning and I think it's much better than  Mr. Maybe  and a little better than  Jemina J  (which was actually very good).    I think I will take a bath.

      I hate the world so I'm going to get my hair cut.  I found a really good deal at a new place and I don't want my hair "Daryl-fied" anymore.  I forgot my glasses and my lunch today, so I'm blind and hungry.  I really just want someone to play with my hair.

      We have a new roommate!  Her name is Adhar and she is very very nice and likes to cook and eat and craft.  I am so happy.  I am not happy that Chrissy is leaving, so I'm going to tie her up and put her under my bed and she will never leave.  Well, maybe not.  I'm not in search of a police record.  But a non-scary roommate is good news, especially after some of the people we've met/talked to.  Update: Abby says she's not sick - she sometimes just throws up.  I say, if you're gonna spew, spew in this.  I am going to read and craft all weekend long.  And sleep.  Sleep sleep sleep.  Justin, I know I'm going to forget to tell you this, but the Flaming Lips are going to be on some WB show on Sunday night I think.  Things I want to do when I get back to Iowa: 1. Take Penny to Devil's Glen Park with the Bs and play in the leaves. 2. Make bread with my mom. 3. Play darts with my dad. 4. Watch a lot of DVDs. 5. Go to Best Buy. 6. Have waffles for breakfast ala CB. 7. See The Gang. 8. Wake up my mom and jump on her bed. 9. MAYBE go for a walk with Mom, Joan, Penny and Bannie. 10. See my little twins. 11. Have a "Buel Family Board Game" night. 12. See the new James Bond movie on Thanksgiving. 13. Watch the West Wing in the same room with my dad for the first time all season. 14. Go to Village Inn with Ab and Miss. 15. Have a sleepover with Mitch (but I am not sleeping anywhere near him). 16. See Helene's new house. 17. Play with the Emmerson's kitten. 18. Christmas shop for Justin. 19. Nap every afternoon on the couch so I will wake up with a huge dog nose in my face. 20. Go to that awesome yarn shop in Milan.  That's all I can think of now.  Print this off, Ladybird, and we'll check them off as we go.  You make a list, too.  You too, Daddy-O.  Love you.

      I just had my senior interview at the journalism school and let me say it was the disappointment of a lifetime.  They tell you to bring your portfolio and resume but you don't have to dress up  too  much - the interviewers just want to see what you learned.  So I got everything all together and finally finished my portfolio, even spent an ungodly amount of money for 80 sheets of resume paper and what happens?  She doesn't even look at it and asks me about the best and worst classes I've ever taken.  Which was a good thing, I guess, because I finally got to lambast a certain strategic writing jackass.  But this is a Wednesday, the only day I don't have to dress up because I'm not at the News Bureau.  So I'm a little peeved.  That's 10 minutes of my life I cannot get back.  In happier news, I missed only two points on my philosophy test.  I am a Vietnam star.  Not something I am particularly proud of.  We made cookies last night.  I know how Subway gets theirs to be really flat - they don't turn the oven up high enough.  Just like me.  I started a new blanket - the ugliest blanket in the world is on hiatus - and it's so cool but I'm not going to tell  urlLink you  about it unless you call me after West Wing tonight.  You are going to be sooooooooooooo jealous you didn't make it first.  Erin Tuttle - in the words of *NSYNC, you make my heart sing.

      My heinous mood has passed.  Forthcoming period + forgetting to take prozac until late in the day = very sad, prone to tears Kristin.  BUT surprise of boyfriend at my doorstep + ice cream sundae + holding boyfriend's hand after I had a terribly scary dream in which people started shooting machine guns at the News Bureau = Kristin feeling better.  And I don't have to work this morning la la la la la but I do have to call a man at KMIZ to get his rate card.  And tonight I get to see two of my best girls, Amy and Kate (hopefully with time to study in between).  And tomorrow maybe I will see someone I haven't seen for quite awhile for our WW date.  And maybe one of these days I will see Abby because sometimes she doesn't come home.    Running late, as per usual.  Roxy is asleep.

      Should Penny have a blog?  Let  urlLink me  know.  It would be called "What Penny Ate," much like Gilda Radner's "What Gilda Ate" on the first year of SNL.  She just got up there and said what she ate and that was the joke.  But now it's actually very sad because she threw up everything she ate.  Penny Lane, on the other hand, does not throw up what she eats.  Only when she's given hydrogen peroxide.  I think I am incredibly homesick.  Reading about all of my friends being excited to go home makes me want to be home this minute.  For the past three years I've been either Justin-sick or homesick at all times.  This summer I was both and it totally sucked.  During Christmas I don't have to be either for a few days.  Those are great days.  Actually, now that I think of it, I  am  kind of Justin-sick.  It's nice just to be in the same room.  We don't have to be talking or anything, but I like to be able to look up from my book and smile at him.  I generally hate my smile because it looks like my face vomited, but my smiles for him seem different.  I do not have the strength to sit through media planning today.  I'm going to maim that little 12 year-old brat with the long blond hair and the high pitched voice.    I want to take off my shoes.

      Things I did today that would make my dad proud: Got my oil changed Got air in my tires Polished 4 pairs of shoes Ate some awesome mustard/onion pretzels  Things I did today that would make my mom proud: Cleaned my room Cleaned my bathroom Took a two-hour nap Read a whole frickin' lot Vacuumed  Things I did today that made me proud: Remembered to wear my glasses while driving (well, that was actually last night) Had a toasted peanut butter and jelly sandwich  I would like to tell everyone a story about how great I am.  When I was in high school, all my friends were amazing singers and would win first place in solo musical theater at the state thespian festival.  Well, the truth is that I was SO GOOD that they couldn't give me any awards and actually, I wasn't allowed to compete, because I would make everyone else look so bad.  It would be like, "First, second and third place go to Kristin Buel for her rendition of "Bad, Bad Man." "  Because at the time, I was a very bad man, badder than Mike Flynn's Frank Butler could ever be.  I was enlighted but frightened though my interest was heightened.    (Or maybe that is all a lie.  You will never know.  Unless you have heard me sing.)  But anyway, because I was SO GOOD, Melissa Mooney (who is now at Indiana University studying opera - she is going to be a star some day, let me tell you) gave me a trophy at the end of the school year because she felt she just couldn't compete.  That trophy had a bowler on top and a computer-paper inscription that read "Kristin Buel - Winner of All Solo Musical Theater."  Well, maybe not (what I mean is, yes, I do have that trophy but not for those precise reasons).  But I once won a BMX bike in a school raffle when I was six.  It was purple.

      Blog of the day:  urlLink theredsweater(dot)com .  I don't know Jamie and we will probably never meet, but I feel that we would be friends.  I got my oil changed this morning.  Get frustrated with one man and then go find another who can fix your car, that's what I always say.  But I highly endorse the Jiffy Lube on Nifong - they even vacuumed the inside of my car (which hasn't been done since my camp days).  Speaking of camp, I keep having dreams about it.  We're talking every night here.  It's really starting to freak me out.  Today I will: Clean my room  Change my sheets Vacuum the house Crochet Finish watching  Footloose  (even though I can recite all of it - "Why'd he send you?"  "I volunteered.") Make banana bread Read two chapters in my social psychology book Continue reading  Backpack  (a pretty good, but not fabulous, book) ...all before 6 p.m.    But now I am getting back in bed.  I think if I had a dog of my own I would be a lot happier.  I miss Penny like hell.  She swallowed a sock yesterday.  Really.  Swallowed it whole.   urlLink Read  about it.  Everyone in this house has been dating their significant other for more than two years now.  Incredible.  It's a nice thing because even though they might wake up mad at you for something you did in their dream, you know it won't last and they will feel bad for yelling at you.  If they know what's good for them, that is.

      I woke up a half hour early to get to el library to do el research but I am being el slowpoke.  I have part of a Justin Timberlake song in my head (I got the CD for $10 at Wal-Mart!) and it's a sing along where he and Pharrel pretend to be girls.  It's a great song.  I had a dream that I had a puppy and a cat and they were friends and slept cuddled up next to each other.  I also had hamsters.  Agh!  Wasting time!  *Note to Penny: Stop eating soap.  That's disgusting and will not make you any friends.  Stick to socks.

      Mayor Ann did not win.  Mayor Ann did not even win in Scott County.  Mayor Ann, it's okay.  You're better than that.  I didn't even know who that other guy was and he was the incumbant.  Clearly unimpressive.  I found a dead bird on my way to class today.  He was lying in front of a window at the law school.  He must have hit the window full force.  I think he was a little finch.  I couldn't stand to see him on the sidewalk so I got some paper out of my bag and picked him up with it (because people are very worried that dead animals have diseases, which I've never really understood, but I didn't want to freak people out if I was using my bare hands).  I had to pet him because I just couldn't help myself.  He was so soft and I felt so bad.  I made him a little bed at the back of a little garden.  The whole thing made me very sad.

      I am thoroughly unimpressed with Election Day 2002.  Big freakin' deal.  I didn't vote because I'm not a Missouri resident yet I still don't really live in Iowa, so I shouldn't be voting anywhere.  Anyway, I would just vote for the females on the ballot no matter what, which isn't a good method.  (But I would vote for Mayor Ann from the bottom of my heart because we had our pictures taken together when I was seven.)  I guess I just don't understand how this election will change anything since George just does pretty much what he wants no matter what Congress says.  My War and Peace class has me disillusioned and upset with the government for stuff that happened 35 years ago, but better late than never.  I just don't trust anyone that thinks the only way to make a difference is to raise money to promote their image and spend two years sitting in a state building.  That's ridiculous.  I mean, if they went out there and were actually helping teachers in the classroom and working at free clinics and picking up garbage with other government workers, well, that would be different.  It would be a reason for me to vote.  Instead, I'm just guaranteeing them a job for the next two years where, essentially, they will argue and get nothing done.  I wish people would give  me  money and guarantee me a job, too.  But that's all boring.    I babysat tonight.  Marina, who is two, and I tried to find Waldo.  I couldn't find him on the first page and boy, did I feel dumb.  She couldn't either, but then again, she's two and I'm 21.  So I definitely need to bone up before I babysit again (although I'm afraid that part of my life is over).  I've had a sad day.  That's all.

      So Justin Timberlake's CD is being released in like, 14 minutes, and I'm afraid that I don't have the will to get into the car, go to Wal-Mart, spend money I don't have and drive back.  Justin, I'm going to get the CD, just wait until Wednesday when I get paid.  My allegience has decreased considerably since the night/morning that Abby, Nanie, Miss and I went to Wal-Mart at 11:58 p.m. to get *NSYNC's  Celebrity  even though we all had to work at the buttcrack of dawn the next morning.  But when you break up with Britney Spears, that's what happens.  (For the record, I would not break up with Britney.  She's a looker.  But, again, she was the idiot who cheated on him.  Kids.)  My fish looks really sad.  Maybe she has a headache, too.  I've had once for nearly eight hours now.  Do you think dogs ever get headaches?  Mom, ask P about that.    Oh!  Roxy's awake and mad as hell (probably because I picked up her tank and pressed my nose against it).  That's my cue to go to bed.  Happy anniversary, Justin.  I love you.

      I do not know these  urlLink people .  I swear to god.  (But look at that cute guy on the left in the first picture.  And if you find Rod Stewart, odds are she's related to me.)  Happy birthday, Ma Nasty.  I kicked that Philosophy of War and Peace test's butt.  I mean, really.  I finally figured out how to study for that test - fill out the study guide while you read things the first time.  Duh.  I didn't have to stay up late at all.  I made a "Craft Corner" for myself in my room.  I moved a few things around and now I have a nice little spot to sit and read, craft and study.  I didn't really have any place to sit before, and I don't want to drag all my crap downstairs and leave it on the kitchen table.  I have a habit of doing that and I'm sorry.  (I'm not sorry when I do that in Iowa because I do not fear the BOE and they have to be reminded of how much they miss me.)  I had a huge breakfast (oatmeal and a banana) and I'm hungry already!  Why is this?

Now I must do what every shell-shocked Vet does - consume alcohol.  (Was that really out of line and mean?  I don't mean it to be, it's just the truth.  In all the books I'm reading, everyone becomes alcoholics.  Nobody suddenly becomes this fabulous moral person.)

Speaking of that little devil, Justin and I are going to play with her tonight.  I am so excited.

      I'm about to start sewing but wanted to jot down a few things before my soul is taken over by the iron and a rotary cutter.  Christmas is an okay holiday.  It makes me sad because there are so many little kids that don't get to have much of a Christmas and I always have a great one.    The presents are great and the food was great, but the best part of the whole day was having my champagne-drinking mother name all the short people she knew.  It was quite a list.  Then she called me a Wookie for 10 minutes.  I'm wearing dog socks.  NEW dog socks.  You're jealous, I can tell.

      So I was awake at the buttcrack of dawn this morning (we're talking pre-sun here, people) walking through our neighborhood and the one across Devil's Glen with mammy, pappy and the puppy, as well as the neighbor and her dog.  Penny was out of control.  I think besides being part crocodile she is also part kangaroo.  It was seven degrees at 5:35 this a.m. and I was cold for a very long time afterwards.  Then Dad went to Panera to get bagels, I ate one and went back to bed.    This afternoon, we are going to see  Drumline  at the cheap seats.  Mmm, drumlines.  I'm excited.  Peny knows I'm awake and is making baby bird sounds downstairs.  It's the saddest sound I've ever heard.  Justin gets to go home today!  I'm very happy for him.  He sounded sad last night (no matter how much he said he didn't).   Why  Wayne's World  is better than  Wayne's World 2 :  * Phil, the drunk guy in the backseat * Rob Lowe * Alice Cooper's speech about the origins of Milwaukee * the  Laverne and Shirley  tribute * "I'm having fun...not." * The Suck-o-Matic.  It really  does  suck. * dream woman * Mr. Donut-head-man   Why  Wayne's World 2  is better than  Wayne's World  : * the Village People tribute * "I like 'em teeny and toasty." * any scene with Garth and Kim Basinger * Aerosmith  I'm going to have to go with  Wayne's World  because  2  has the naked Indian, a Jim Morrison impersonator who doesn't look like Jim Morrison, the fight between Wayne and Cassandra's dad and no Phil.  Phil is really what makes the movie.

      Just so everyone knows, Wayne's World and Wayne's World 2 are on TNN (or TNT? TBS?) tonight starting at 6 p.m.  Party on.  I'm in the middle of a crocheting frenzy.  Will I get the blanket done by tomorrow?  Tune in next time to find out (right now I'm saying yes, but if my wrist starts hurting I'm going to be out of commission for a few hours and that will totally throw off my schedule).  Now I'm going to lift weights so I'll be prepared when I see people I don't like.  I'll just pick them up and toss them the hell out of the way.

      * I retract what I said about Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn.  I looked up some pictures of him in real life and he is in no way as attractive as he is in Lord of the Rings.  It must be the dirtiness, long hair and the sword.  The facial hair might have something to do with it, too.  Never fear Justin Timberlake - the ACTOR will not replace you, but just the role the actor plays.

      It's a tired Kristin that writes this post.  But she will not speak in third person because it really bothers her when people sending in hometowners do that.  It is confusing and dumb and every single person from the j-school (well, not the photo or ad majors, actually, because photo majors say very little on hometowners and ad majors have nothing to brag about except for the fact that they didn't wring the department chair's neck during the semester from hell) does it, like they're reporting on themselves.  It kind of freaks me out - separating from yourself to write about yourself like you're a stranger to yourself...  And yes, it was a long drive back to Iowa today.  I did, however, sing along with Color Me Badd's "I Wanna Sex You Up," which always reminds me of my friend Mimi from high school who was a foreign exchange student from Brazil.  I was with her when she bought her first American bra.  It was a proud moment.  Lord of the Rings was great.  It wasn't as scary as the first one and the Orks weren't as blue.  And Aragorn was SO FREAKING HOT that I very nearly stopped breathing every time he smiled.  Or frowned.  Or blinked.  This may be premature, but I think he might be my new Justin Timberlake.  We knew that day would come sometime, but did we know that it would be prompted by a long-haired guy with a sword?    It's nice to be home.  We went to the Alcoa Christmas basket thingy tonight and assembled boxes of food for needy families in the area.  It always makes me want to cry seeing everyone coming right over after work and helping people they don't even know.  The little kids give you the vegetables and canned goods and they're so sweet and they don't even realize what good things they're doing.  And everyone's laughing and having fun and it makes me really happy and sad all at once.  Roxy has boycotted the kitchen and is staying in my room this visit.  She's next to the computer, just like she is in Missouri.  I think the buzzing comforts her.  It's going to be a lonely week or so in my bed.  I like sleeping alone when I'm exhausted and stressed out, but not when I'm relaxing for long periods of time.  It's lonely and there's no one to wake up when I get up to go to the bathroom five times a night.  Well, except my dad, but he thinks I'm an intruder and yet doesn't get up to see if I'm stealing things.    I miss you, Justin.

      Let me tell you about Kathy From the Block (now and forever known as my girl KLo).  KLo was my boss.  Was.  Today was her last day.  She has this smile that could light up Los Angeles during an energy crisis.  Her laugh blows out of her cubicle and races down the hall and around the corner to find me.  She's the kind of person that you want as your sister, your mom and your best friend.  KLo met ESPN anchor John Anderson and even got to drive his baby around.  She says "Oodelay" instead of hello.  She loves Buffy.  She thinks a certain MU faculty member is good...for her to poop on.  She gives me missions and I accept them.  She makes coming into work each day fun and exciting.  I was scared when I started working at the top of Jesse Hall.  I didn't know anyone and the girl that I shared a cube with was so scary that I wanted to quit right away (well, maybe not, maybe she's the coolest girl I've known in a long time, but anyway) and KLo was my friend and made me smile.  She says there's always room for me at her house if I want to have a sleepover.  I always thought that there wasn't anyone I'd like to be when I grew up, that I would be my own person and find my own way.  I think I'll still do that, but KLo's the closest thing to what I want to be.   I'll miss ya, KLo.  I can't wait to play with you and the other girls in January.  But it's not going to be the same (not even if they hire a really hot guy in your place).  Love always, Snoop

      I hate waking up in a bad mood.  I went to sleep in one and now I'm here.  I even got up early to be in this mood.  There was no dancing last night because I am a big poop and also a pretty bad friend.  I hope he doesn't hate me for ever.  I haven't started planning my presentation to our client today.  That's why I'm up.  Hopefully I will be done early enough before work that I can play Contra and get all this bad stuff out of my system.  I keep having dreams about people that make me angry.  This is not helping.  All of you people, go away.  * Note to Rob and Scott: Sorry about not making it over last night.  Girl Sleuths tortured me for quite awhile and then I was not in a festive mood.  And today is my favorite boss in the whole entire world's last day.  I don't want to talk about it.

      Oh.  My.  God.  I just saw Justin Timberlake's new video, "Cry me a River," and let me tell you, it is creeee-py.  It's all about him stalking Britney and having sex with this girl on Britney's bed and taping it and then playing it while Britney's in the shower.  The girl in the video really does look like Britney and he kicks and actual picture of Britney into the camera.  Even when he's a stalker he's the sexiest man alive.  And he's wearing a black hooded sweatshirt just like "my" Justin has.  Except mine had it first.  Now I just have 22 minutes to write that thing.  Damn you, MTV.com.

      I just finished writing my detective story la la la la la.  Thirty-six minutes until *NSYNC dance extraveganza.  Buy your tickets now before they're all gone.  Yes, I CAN write a critical analysis of Cherry Ames, Visiting Nurse in 36 minutes.  And what's more, I will.

      I took my one and only final and now I'm at work.  Long day at work.  Looooooooong day.  But I'm keeping busy.  I decided that after a semester of employment, I will finally make my desk mine and arrange stuff the way I like it.  They can't kick me out now.  Highlights of my weekend: * Playing with the only person I'd ever want to live with in Chez Crowley, the one, the only, Maria White.  I don't get to see her nearly enough, but she is one of my dearest friends.  I can (and do) tell her everything. * Kicking Abby's butt at Hoops.  Hahahahahaha.  And we got to the second level of Contra. * Cooking up a storm and cleaning the oven.  You can't even tell a pie exploded in there in August. * Sewing fun with Joanna Carter.  Jon has some really nice pants. * Seeing "Unccy Paul" Wilson * Watching the Nancy Drew movie on ABC last night.  I endorse it, even though Bess is tall, skinny and blond in the movie.  In the books, she's short, plump and blond.  But Nancy FINALLY gets tired of stupid Ned.  I've been waiting for that all semester.  But who's that other guy?  He wasn't ever in the books.  Nor was the girl from Cuba, but that's because Nancy is racist in the books. * Going to Kate Jeffrie's fab party.  It was so classy and everything that a grown-up party should be.  She looked like Julia Stiles.  I am so glad she lets me be her friend. * Seeing Melissa Maynard.  She's giving Nanie a run for her money for "The Cutest Girl I Have Ever Known." * Getting a big hug from Julie Thursday night.  I miss her.  I've had a few revelations in the past few days.  Justin and I are like puzzle pieces for many reasons AND I know exactly why Britney and Justin broke up.  Listen to his CD 80 times and you will, too.  I will tell you all of these mysteries and much, much more, if you ask nicely.  Abby and I decided we should teach a class about Britney and Justin.  I would also be able to teach a class about the Jackson 5 and *NSYNC.  I would not charge tuition, even if you were from out-of-state.  Registration starts now.

      I am more than a little stressed out.  Philosophy of War and Peace can take a flying leap for all I care.  I will be studying until my eyes fall out.  But not really.  I feel kind of irresponsible because I keep inviting friends over and going to other people's houses.  I need to buckle down.  And buckle up.  It's the law.  I also have to finish my detective fiction for Girl Sleuths and I'm afraid I haven't gotten very far in it yet.  I just don't have the will for finals week.  So I just glanced at Osama bin Laden's "Letter to America" and I think he didn't really write it because I don't think Osama would use three exclamation points in a row.  Instead of studying today, I: * took a nap * went to Schnuck's * had a pizza party * cleaned the oven * made Body Basics t-shirts with iron-ons  Well, actually, I guess I didn't avoid it all that much because my media planning group and I were finishing our presentation stuff for Tuesday.  But still.  Oh yeah, and Abby and I played Blades of Steel on Nintendo.  She barely kicked my butt.  She's going down.

      The trash compactor at Mark Twain is called the "Cram-O-Matic."  No joke.  It's right on the side of the machine.  I have some hardcore crafting to do tonight through next week, as well as some hardcore detective writing and philsophy studying.  I'm thinking crafting is going to get the priority here.  I need to get some stuff done before tomorrow night's News Bureau staff party and start some little projects.    I hope it snows.  It's SO WEIRD to hear John Conroy on the Q106.1 radio show.  Every time I hear his voice I remember how he really really really wanted a Rascal to ride around campus.  I'm wearing my snowflake necklace today.  Call me Suzy.

      The philosophy paper is finished!  And it's not as bad as I thought it was last night (probably because I fixed it a lot tonight).  Justin is super because he took me to dinner after I was crabby at him.  Not  to  him, just in his general direction.  It's time for the (as of this minute) Annual Musical Showdown!  Da da da daaaaa!  Here's how it works.  I listen to the recording of a musical and I tell everyone what the musical is about.  I'm not really into the classic  classic  musicals like  My Fair Lady  or anything like that because that stuff kinda sucks.  For example: Today's lesson is  L'il Abner  THE BEST MUSICAL IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD.  And don't fight with me or I'll be takin' that rag offin' the bush.   L'il Abner  was my very first musical in high school.  I was Assistant Right Stage (motto: They put all the retards on right).  It was the best show ever.  My dad built a house that shook with domestic disturbance and a ramp so we could drive a golf cart onto the stage from the audience.  I also had my first major injury during that show - it was dress rehearsal so all the tech Es were in black (I was wearing my long sleeved t-shirt from the first show - and my first role - that year,  The Uninvited ).  I ran into some plywood sticking out of the wood pile and my left arm had a huge gash in it.  It swelled up and bled everywhere, and the girl that was right stage (she could put a golf tee through a hole in one of her ears) wouldn't let me get a band-aid.  After the rehearsal, I went to find a first-aid kid (of course we didn't have one) and a hot senior boy felt bad for me.  Anyway.   L'il Abner .  It's about that cartoon hero from Dogpatch, USA, Abner Yokum.  Abner's the stupidest person in the world.  He's being chased by Daisy Mae Scragg, the girl with the shortest shorts in town (where the term Daisy Duke probably originated).  Well, his mom, Mammy Yokum, has this big tree in their frontyard.  It grows yokumberries.  (Hence the line: "I whomps 'em from my yokumberry tree.)  Abner's been drinking yokumnberry juice since forever.  He's a big hunky fella, and it turns out that the yokumberry juice is what does it.  A government man comes and tells Dogpatch that they are the most worthless place in the world and will be the test site for a nuclear bomb,  BUT the yokumberry tree saves the day and they take all these guys to Washington to test the yokumberry juice on them.  In the meantime, General Bullmoose, a big wig in Washington, wants to have yokumberry juice for his own.  So he has his assistant, Appassionata Von Climax, seduce Abner.  But Abner's an idiot.  Then comes the annual Sadie Hawkin's Day race, where the girls catch the boys they will marry.  Abner finally says Daisy Mae can catch him.  But oh no!  Thanks to the help of Evil Eye Fleegle, Appassionata catches Abner.  What ever will happen?  (Well, turns out the yokumberry juice doesn't work and Appassionata no longer wants Abner and "Hark!  Something has fallen from our statue!" and it turns out that Dogpatch was the site of General Jubiliation T. Cornpone's final defeat.  Dogpatch is saved and Daisy and Abner get hitched.)  Truly the best show EVER.  My favorite song is the opening when they introduce all the characters.  The show is actually available on VHS - Stubby Kaye (Nicely Nicely from  Guys and Dolls ) is Marryin' Sam.  I have it.  Let's watch it.  And if you think you won't like it, remember: there's a whole lotta people wearing a whole lotta no clothes.  Major props to Justin for finding this CD for me in New York this summer.  I think it was last released on vinyl in the 40s or something.  Tomorrow: AAAANNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIE get your gun get your gun get your gun.

      I read three books this week.   Hotel Kid  was pretty good - an autobiography about this kid's life as he grew up in New York's best hotel during the Depression.  I think my mom would really like it.   Rachel's Holiday , by Marian Keyes, is the semi-sequel to her  Watermelon  and really great.  There was one little tear in the corner of my eye as I finished it, I was so happy.   Girl's Poker Night  by Jill A. Davis was awesome - I read it part of last night and this morning.  I'm now reading  Last Chance Saloon , also by Marian Keyes - I'm trying to read all of her books at once, actually.   Angels  is next.  It's been a good reading week.    The media plan is done.  It's PDF'd.  Tomorrow it goes to printing services.  I wash my hands of it.  I really need to start that stupid philosophy paper.  Justin and I decided my three favorite categories of things are: 1. Dogs 2. Yarn 3. Books  Those are the things that I spend my money on (well, not really dogs, but I would if I could.  And not so much books because I go to the library twice a week.  And not so much yarn because I have to pay things like rent and utilities.  But you know what I mean.).  Those are the things I always want, can't get enough of.  My neighbor Mr. Woodward got me in the holiday spirit tonight - for once, I feel festive and a little excited about the holidays.  It's kind of cool - my last few winters have been very...just bad.  This is going to be a good one.  As long as I don't run out of Prozac.  Penny called me today.  She was bad and wanted someone to talk to, I guess.    Did you know...? I am the boss of Justin. My mom is the boss of Justin. But my mom is not the boss of me.  She used to be, in what she calls "The Good Old Days."  In fact, she's the boss of everyone BUT me.  Hence her name, BOE (Boss of Everyone). It seems like Justin isn't the boss of anyone.  Sorry, Justin.  For Christmas, my mom wants the "Wise Guy" named "Casper" for her nativity scene.  "He's got the gold," she says.  If I were her, I'd bet on getting another barnyard animal.  Or another baby Jesus.  You just can't have too many of those.

      This is the never-ending media plan.  It's all, hey, how 'bout we add another three pages because I know you don't have a philosophy paper to work on called "Hell no!  I won't go!".  And I'm all, I want to kill you.  I'm so close that it hurts.  As in, I'm in a lot of pain right now.  I better eat some Jell-O.  (Three layered Jell-O.  I'm a culinary goddess.)

      I totally just added comments to my blog.  On the first try, even.  (Well, technically, I tried a few months ago and it didn't work and I got really mad so just forgot about it.)  I'm currently on phone duty at work and nobody is calling (everyone else is in a staff meeting).  Sad.  But when people  do  call, I get really confused because they call asking if I want to go to a respiration therapy conference or something and I'm like, I think you need to call the hospital for that.  Did I ever mention that my mom thinks that saying "word" at the end of a sentence is equivalent to saying "amen"?  I didn't?  She also knows a lot about gangs and would be willing to share her vast knowledge of what it means to throw shoes over a phone line with you.  Walter Williams (the building, not the man) smells like week-old vomit.  Or else they're hiding bodies in the walls.  I vote for both.

      I have had more exercise this morning than I care to ever have in my LIFE.  Abby and I got up at 7 and did Darrin's Dance Grooves quietly so as to not wake Chrissy (we were successful).  Darrin choreographs for Britney, Justin and the Boys and everyone favorite teen idol of yesteryear, Jordan Knight.  We already "know" the Britney dance, so we tried to learn "Bye Bye Bye" for like the 50th time.  We did pretty well.  Afterwards, I hit the side of my foot on the kitchen table and fell to the ground, sqirming in pain.  Abby laughed.  She's getting a beating later.  Clare, you need to e-mail my mom.  Her address is  urlLink mbuel@mchsi.com  and I think you and she are going to be best friends.  Everyone else e-mail my mom too because she would love it.  It would make her day.  Oh yeah, the exercise.  Then, after I spent a million years at the RAP office copying door decks for winter training, I decided to walk to Brady to drop something off at the Wellness Resource Center and then mail our heating bill.  Then I decided to walk to the J-school to drop off el big paper.  Then I walked to Mark Twain to work.  That's a lot of walking.  And Jen's office is so hot and I'm so hot from walking that I'm ready to talk my clothes off.  I doubt that is Res. Life approved.  Just so everyone knows, my fish hates Iowa.  HATES it.  She barely moved while she was there.  Now she's back to her wriggly little self.  I think it's because her water almost froze in our kitchen.  I started my morning with a kiss from the puppy across the street.  I was unlocking my car and she came bounding up the hill, tail all atwitter.  We snuggled and kissed and she tried to get into my coat, but then I took her back to her yard so her mom wouldn't miss her.  I love that dog.

      Okay, so I have this thing I should probably tell my parents but I don't really want to call and tell them because even though I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU I don't really want to get a lecture.  I've had enough lectures to last me a lifetime, thank you.  So here it goes.  I got stopped for speeding yesterday.  I was just about to get to Wapello (I know!  Wapello!  Nothing happens in Wapello!  You're not still paying attention, are you?).  A very nice sheriff pulled me over.  Perhaps at another place, another time, we could have been friends.  So he asks me if I'm having a medical emergency and I said no and I asked if the speed limit was still 65 (because 10 minutes ago in Muscatine it sure as hell was - nobody wants to drive slowly in Muscatine).  And he says no, it's 55.  And I say I am really super sorry for going 15 miles over the speed limit.  And then I forgot what "registration" looks like and made an ass of myself trying to find it.  But I did and he let me off with a warning - not really even a warning, just a "use that cruise control, okay?" (which is what I was doing in the first place that got me pulled over!) - and I felt guilty for 230 miles.  So I'm telling you this because the last time I got pulled over I didn't tell you for like, a year (even though I just got a warning then, too, probably because Colleen Rutten was in my car and was about to start crying), and I felt really bad.  Like, super bad.  Needless to say, I drove the speed limit the entire rest of the way to Missouri and was passed by about 30 cars, 5 semis and a horse with a gimp leg.  So now we will never talk about this again.  Thank you.

      I asked Abby why being sick is always worse at night and she said it's because your body shuts down and "that's when most people die."  Excellent.  That girl is certifiably insane.  I could detail her escapades of the last 48 hours, but some of those things are just too good to share.  (Unless you ask me in person.)  She makes me so freaking happy.  I want to claw out my throat.  I had visions of doing this while driving home last night.  On the way back from a jaunt to see an old roommate, the Abarone and I stopped at a gas station for hot chocolate.  It was really hot.  We got home and I drank some and completely scalded the left side of my throat.  I thought I was going to choke.  Lesson: You think your sore throat is bad?  Try ACTUALLY BURNING IT.   That's  bad.  I wish I could look down my throat and see if there is a big burn mark, but my mouth doesn't open that wide.  It's a shame. I could fit a lot more cake in there if it did.  Oooh.  Cake.  If you are my great friend and you have a birthday in the next few days, you best be having cake with said birthday.  Or else I'm gonna have to buy one myself.  Or I could make one.  But it wouldn't be as good without the Hy-Vee frosting.  Back to bed.

      Friends, Thanks for the super birthday celebration.  It was the nicest time I've had in a long time.  Especially when Paul danced for a dime.  I'm not feeling so well.  I have a sore throat and some wicked post-nasal drip.  Sweet.  Nothing a good 10 hours of rest won't cure.  Diva Night at K-Lo's was so fun.  Ming is the best Stevie Nicks/A-ha impersonator I have ever met.  And I've never seen anyone be more intimate than Kelsey.  Amy stole my gloves and hat, so we're in a fight.  Time for more knitting.  I'm slowly but surely getting back on the craft train.

      I haven't felt this good in a long time.  A loooooong time.  But baby, I'm back.  Back in a big way.  Back in a "Let's Dance in the Street Because We're Feeling Like we Just Won the Lottery," way.    I can't tell you how good this feels.    I don't know why it happened, it just did.  And I'm so glad.  I had a birthday on Wednesday.  It was really nice.  Justin is hands-down the best boyfriend ever because he carries on the birthday traditions my parents started.  And he gave me super hero undergarments.  Abby got me a cake with a tractor and a farm on it.  The icing was fields.  It was awesome and reminded me of home.  She also got me puff paint, which is what we all know I REALLY wanted for my birthday, even if I didn't consciously realize it.  But she did, because we share a brain.  And Amy gave me a Nancy Drew calendar, which was really the most thoughtful gift ever, because it will always remind me of her (although it's hard NOT to think of her because she doesn't stop yapping at me all day -- and NO, we are NOT in a fight).  And my dad called from Chicago to wish me happy birthday.  And so did Adhar's cousin Mariah, whom I really like.  And so did Chrissy, my long-lost roommate and great friend.  And Jon acted like Miss Pam for me and Andi made a great card and so many other people made it special but I can't think of it now because it's 4 a.m.  Roxy and Penny are a lot alike.  Penny rubs her butt against the couch, my foot, the table, anything carbon-based, and Roxy rubs her tail fins against the side of her tank.  Maybe it's just me.  You know what's also been really great this week?  Talking to/getting e-mails from friends who I don't get to see a lot because they're worried about me.  I didn't think anyone ever worried about me except Justin.  You guys make stuff a lot easier.  Other highlights of the week: *  Joe Millionaire  (Zora MUST win) * Lots of cake * Hangin' at the Burg with Henry Hager * Last night's bubble bath * My capstone group  * A clean room  And the best of all will be tonight when we have Diva Night at K-Lo's pad.  I am so excited.  And I'm going to cook all day tomorrow - just wait until you see what I have in store for you.  And yes,  urlLink Paul , you are going to hell.

      Here's what's been bothering me: 1. Graduating 2. Finding a job. 3. Possibly moving somewhere alone where I don't know anyone at all. 4. Getting married.  I know that none of these things are going to happen anytime soon, but they are still freaking me out.  And I'm homesick, because how could you NOT want to be with my mother all the time?  I've been pretty miserable for the past week.  I cry every afternoon and I don't even know why.  I AM getting professional help, but what helps me most right now is talking to my friends.  So if you're feeling the same way, I'd like to know.  And if you have advice, I'd like to know.  My birthday is Wednesday and I'm notorious for having bad birthdays (we all remember the freshman year night from hell, right?).  I don't want to be older.  I don't feel 22.  But all of a sudden tonight everything didn't seem so bad.  The exact same thing happened to me this exact same night last year.  Perhaps it's because I'm ready to face it, or perhaps it's because of Martin Luther King, Jr.    The feeling I entertain most right now is guilt.  I feel guilty for wanting to be alone, for asking people to listen to me, for crying.    I don't like to ask for help.  It's embarassing.  I hate putting my flaws out into the open.  What if people think I'm crazy?  Annoying?  Stupid?  But I'm asking for help now.  I don't want to go through this alone.  And you all know that if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always here, right?  Because I am.

      Per request of my mother, I'm posting.  I don't have a lot to say.  The past few days have been hard for me.  I cry a lot.  Each day gets easier.  I hope that your early 20s are the hardest part of your life because I don't know how things could get worse later on.  Finding jobs, making future plans with your boyfriend, realizing Iowa isn't your main address and missing your parents really really really suck.  It's all scary and I hate it.  I could use a Mom-hug.

      In T-minus however many minutes, I'll be back on the road to Columbia.  I'm happy and a little sad.  I like it here.  But I like it there.  And I'm excited to listen to the Rolling Stones CDs I got for my birthday (we had a little 1 1/2-week early celebration yesterday) from my parents.  So it will be a good drive.  We went to 11th Street Precinct with the Gang last night and saw the  urlLink Sin City Orchestra  play.  They were awesome.  As was the man who would smack his pelvis and then thrust it repeatedly.  He looked like George Costanza's dad.  But I learned that a petite woman lit up on two martinis (with her own olives from her purse, naturally) knows a lot more about love and life than an almost-22 year old drinking Smirnoff Ice.  Maybe it's the olives.  Maybe it's because she brought her own glass.  Whichever the case, she helped a lot.

       urlLink Maria White , don't you EVER go to the Olde Un to play video games without me again.  I'm going to kick your butt tomorrow.  Ab-a-rone, did you make it home safely?  Did you forget anything in D-port that I can bring back with me?  That's all.

      I just got back from the most harrowing experience of my life.  My mom agreed to teach some 5th grade Girl Scouts how to crochet.  She said there would be five.  In the car, she said I was going to teach and she would take pictures.    When we got there, there were 11 Girl Scouts and three stupid mothers.  So I came home and had some alcohol and soup.  I can't feel my legs.  In two hours, I go to neighborhood Bunko.  Is it time to go back to Missouri?

      So I haven't been sleepig well lately.  Hence the early post time.  This stinks.  I've been quilting a lot lately - I'm working on four quilts for some foster kids who live in New Florence.  I put the wrong border on one of them and had to rip it out yesterday.  I had three sides of it done.  Doh.  But I have everything cut and ready to be sewn (I really hate cutting - well, maybe not hate, but it's tiresome).  I have one completely done.  By "completely done" I mean the front and back are sewn - all I need to do is get some batting, quilt and bind it.  I'm excited to try my new quilting foot on my sewing machine.  I'm still working on knitting my sweater and I finished a replacement scarf last night (I lost my green one at a restaurant in Orland Park.  No big loss.).  I'm going to embroider the scarf, I think, with some neat mohair-like yarn.  My parents and I went to Biaggi's, the best restaurant in town, last night, to celebrate my birthday two weeks early.  Then we came home and watched a new  West Wing .  It was a perfect night.  I even washed my hair in honor of it.

      Abby is coming over soon, la la la la.    My parents didn't really want a daughter - they just wanted someone to chauffeur them around between home and car dealerships.  I sewed for a bit this morning and have the first of four quilt tops finished.  It's cute - red with white nautical designs, then the reverse for the contrasting blocks.  I'm not wearing my glasses, so if things are spelled wrong, get over it.  Tonight is the premier of  Joe Millionaire .  I  know  Mr. Sessions will be watching it.  I, of course, will be glued to the TV.  Could this replace my penchant for  FM Nation ?  Let's hope so.  I miss Porky.  I'm not really big on cleanliness of any kind right now, so I'd advise everyone to stay at least 10 feet away from me (I did just get out of the shower, but who knows when the next one will happen).  I had a disaster involving yarn last night.  Let's not speak of it ever again.

      It's been awhile since I've posted and it's been awhile since I've felt like myself.  Suffice it to say that I have the same problem every holiday season and become this crazy, mixed-up person who can't control how she feels about anything and nothing is ever right.  Maybe it's just a downward spiral to the end of the year and then I start all over again in January.    Whatever.  I am done with all of that.  I am starting over and stomping all over the things that upset and scare me.  I am also going to eat a brownie soon.  I made them last night and they are goo-ood.  I think I'm ready to be back in Columbia and resume my life again.  I like being at home but it's not really my home, is it?  I need to realize that I am completely independent and don't need to think that I still rely on my parents (because I don't, but it sure would be nice sometimes, wouldn't it?).  Growing up is the hardest thing I've ever done, besides trying to learn how to use a curling iron (still no dice on that one).   urlLink Maria , I'm sorry about your hair.  And also greatly amused.   urlLink Clare , I think I know exactly how you're feeling lately.  It totally sucks and everything seems out of your control except cookie dough in bed.  You definitely should have socked that lady at Target.   urlLink Dave , stop eating Spam.  I had to eat it at camp this summer and although it wasn't too bad, it messes up your digestion for days.  I finally finished  Wuthering Heights .  I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I started Maeve Binchey's  Scarlet Feather , which, of course, is great.  My dad and I went to Krispy Kreme to watch the doughnuts being made this morning.  It was awesome.  His first job was in a doughnut factory, so he wasn't as impressed as I was.  I slept in the Princess Bed last night because my bed makes my bed hurt.  I had the mosquito netting all pulled around it - I felt like I was inside a huge, fluffy white cloud.  Then a dog nose poking through the netting woke me up.  She is a bad seed.  My dad and I filled up the water bags in my bed a little while ago, so everything should be okay.  No more Princess Bed for me.  It was fun while it lasted, though.  Add "being in love" to the list of the hardest things in the world, right after "growing up" and "using a curling iron."  It might be frustrating, but I think it's eventually all worth it.

      I just finished my first sweater.  I'm wearing it right now.  I'm not excited because I'm kind of in shock.  I knew what it looked like in my hands for two months (two months and a day, actually - it seems longer), what it felt like, smelled like, and when I put it on, I didn't recognize it anymore.  How did those four pieces of fabric turn into something I can wear?  And it fits, too!  This is so much better than making a blanket.  I still love blankets, but I'm actually wearing something I made.  Wow.

      So get this.  I'm supposed to have a Global Communications test at 10:00.  My teacher doesn't show.  We wait and wait.  We think maybe he got in a car accident.  We call his office.  No answer.  We wait some more.  We finally leave at 10:32, thinking this is very un-Fritz-like.  It turns out that Fritz is in Prague and a grad student was supposed to administer the test.  He never showed.  The secretary says Fritz is going to be very mad at the grad student, but not at us.  I am mad because I had to walk from Virginia garage to Lee Hills in the 9 degree cold.

I tried it on, floppy but nevertheless in one piece, last night, and it looks great.  And I'm pretty sure it fits!    2. Norah Jones is great.  *NSYNC is greater.  3. I managed to not play the Sims for more than 24 hours.  We're on hour 33 right now and going strong.

      I have many important things to say:  First of all, I freaking KNEW it was Zora from the very first show.  I totally called it.  When she asked if she had tangerine in her teeth and he said no and then he asked if he had anything in his teeth, I KNEW.  Take THAT, slutty Sarah.    Second, Jon, I am sorry that I punched you in the kidney.  I was really excited about Evan and Zora and lost control of my limbs.  I am still addicted to the Sims and the little girl in the family got sent to military school because she kept playing hooky.  Little brat.  This is what I did instead of studying for my stat quiz (which I did really well on, but does it even matter since I'm taking it pass/fail?).  I am tired of people bragging that they are drunk all the time.  That is so 1994-afterschool special.  In fact, I'm sick of bragging.  I don't really care how good you are.  I do, however, accept bragging about: how much you can eat, how long it's been since you've showered, how many times you've watched  Wayne's World , the fact that you know every episode of the  Golden Girls , et al.  So I guess the general rule is "Stop making yourself look like a jackass."  It's unattractive and distracts me from eating.  From what I gather, my little dog is "all growed up" now that she is two.  I wish I could say the same for others 10 times her age.  I wish I had a mouse.  I would name it Lefty and we would watch  Elimidate  together and when I would threaten someone, they would say "Yeah, you and who else?" and I would reply "Me and this here mouse."

      So I'm an idiot and can't tell my commas from periods.  The ACTUAL number is 54 Zimbabwean dollars = one US dollar.  Not as incredibly horrible as I thought before.  But it's still really bad considering that 5 years ago it was 11 Zimbabwean dollars for one US dollar.  They have 100% inflation.  Who CARES about advertising in Zimbabwe when the people can't afford anything?  I think there are bigger problems there than selling Nikes and Coca-Cola.

      Most people in Zimbabwe only get to eat one meal a day.  This includes business people and urban dwellers.  54,000 of their dollars equals one of ours.  One month of living is about 62,000 Zimbabwe dollars.  That's less than 10 of our dollars a month.  Sometimes it makes me sad to live in America.

      My right shoulder really hurts.  I think it's due to a really heavy purse and a really heavy backpack.  It's a challenge trying to come up with new things to do at work.  I'm waiting for a bunch of professors to e-mail me back and since they aren't just sitting around trying to find things to do, it's taking a long time.  And I'm really trying to not eat the cookies I brought, but it will be tough.  I love it when Jen leaves me a message about a project she didn't assign to me.  It's so funny.   Historical Abby Moment of the Day:  Once Abby danced with a boy named Miami.  "His name was...Miami."  Happy birthday, Penny!  I love you!

      Today has been a great day, much better than yesterday.  Great great great.  Abby and I made chocolate chocolate pecan cookies and they are fab-u-lous.  The secret: cake mix.  She is watching the dog show (DOG SHOW!) and I'm trying to get a little work done before my weekly date with Miss J.  It is impossible for me to say "dog show" (DOG SHOW!) without screaming "DOG SHOW!" like in Saturday Night Live.  If I had a drum, I would beat it.  I also cannot answer "What time is it?" without responding, "Time to get a new fence."  I can't end a sentence with just the word "crazy."  I have to say, "Crazy.  Crazy like a beaver!"   These are the repercussions of being special.  I have about 14 books from the library.  They all look really good.  My feet are cold.

      I don't think I will ever get caught up on my homework.  There's school and then there's capstone, which is quickly sucking out my will to live.  I realize by doing my part of the project now that I won't be quite as busy at the end of the semester, but it's still annoying that no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to get around to studying stat (even though it's just pass/fail, but still, I'm taking it so I can learn something).  But to all those folks who filled out our survey - thanks.  I can't wait to spend hours pouring over them.  Whee!  I had SUCH a good weekend thanks to my boyfriend and his wonderful family.  It was just what I needed.  Now what I need is someone to read my Global Communications for me.  Oh Fritz, why do you hurt me so?

Since I'm now a member of a crafting webring (I don't even know what that means, but check out the new link at the top), I feel it is my crafters duty to tip you off to some interesting sites.  You can make your own underwear out of old t-shirts  urlLink here  and get awesome recipies  urlLink here .  Don't say I never gave you anything.  Dave!  My teacher - Steve "Call me Mr. Veile" Veile gave us your capstone book today for reference.  How cool is that?  (Hmmm, five squared?)

My mom beat up my ex-boyfriend's dad at an auction to get it.  Right on.  But  urlLink you  never gave her a bunny, did you?  I'm about to start Hometowner Hell here at the NB.  I have to mentally prepare myself for the ones that didn't actually put there accomplishment anywhere on the form, but just their name.  Which, for most of these people, is accomplishment enough.  I have been craving chocolate for a week and french fries for three days.  Fritz is responsible for the fries (WHY does he talk about McDonald's during every class?) and hormones are responsible for the chocolate.  I would LOVE a Nutty Bar right now.  Okay.  Deep breath.

      The fabulous Miss J didn't have cake at her birthday (well, cheesecake, but that's not  cake  cake), so I made gooey butter cake today.  Mmm.  I also cleaned like a madwoman and mopped every mop-able surface.  Abby,  urlLink the Boy  and I took a glorious walk along the MKT and stepped in a lot of mud.    I'm ready to kick my capstone in it's proverbial head.  And my cough.  I did some intense "core strengthening" yesterday with my "The Pilates Method" 90-minute workout video (don't worry, I would never even  dream  of doing 90 minutes of activity that didn't involve eating and/or napping midway through), which, of course, leads to sore abdominal muscles.  Now every time I cough I'm convinced that my lungs are going to burst through my skin.  I'm knitting the first arm of my first sweater.  I'm concerned I'm not following the directions correctly.  I guess we'll see.  Hey, P - it's almost your birthday!

       urlLink My thoughts exactly.   Two job interviews down, two to go.  One in St. Louis on Wednesday, one in on Chicago Friday. All that = too much I-70 for me.  I forgot my parents' anniversary.  I am a horrible child.  But I bet I'm not the only one who forgot.  And besides, I didn't even know what number of the month it was all week.  Vacation does things like that to you.  Tired.  Must translate focus group tape.  Tired > need to translate.  But that means I'd have to do it tomorrow night and we all know I don't want to do that...  I am always hungry.

      It's been a dizzying past few days.  I got home in Iowa at 2:20 Friday afternoon.  By 2:30, I had three job/internship interviews in the works.  Now I'm up to four and it's like I'm living in an alternate universe.  So I'm going to Kansas City on Wednesday for two interviews on Thursday, I have a Chicago interview over the phone tomorrow (which will turn into an in-person in a few days if they like me) and one in St. Louis next week (meaning I will have to miss Fritz's class).  IN-sane.    Of course, I wasn't expecting any of this.  I was calling off the job search for a week, so I didn't even bring home my portfolio.  Luckily, my dashing boyfriend Fed-Exed it to me.  I brought no nice clothes, so my parents and I made the most harrowing shopping excursion in the world yesterday (but I do look damn good).  I got my hair cut and highlighted on Saturday.  It's like my own personal Makeover Story.  I also conducted a focus group today, which went pretty smoothly.  I lifted weights, took a big nap, went on a walk with my mom and P and taught my mom how to play The Sims.  It's been a big day.  After my phone interview tomorrow, we're going to the yarn store.  Yessssssss.  I'm going to make an awesome sweater and need to get some mohair yarn.  And some wool for those stupid slippers.  I will work on those in the car to KC.  And I'm ready for bed.

      My cold is gone, the violently-ill spell is over and I watched "Blue Crush" yesterday afternoon.  So here's some unsolicited advice to the masses: * If he makes you unhappy, break up with him. * Be with people who make you happy, not those who you  wish  would make you happy. * Maria White, if you don't update your blog I'm gonna call the neighbors on you. * To all the media-types: Don't go around thinking this war is going to make you look good.  It's going to kill a lot of innocent Iraqis (especially children) and you look like a dumb-ass for touting it.  Not to mention that nobody really cares what you do. * Clean up your own damn dishes. * A Cadbury Egg, even uneaten, will cure what ails ya. * If you're a mom and you're scared, the kid will take care of you. * If your name is Penny Lane and you even  think  about eating your big sister's socks, you've got another thing coming. * When trying to felt a knitting project, make sure you used wool.  Or else you will start screaming and throwing your stat textbook haphazardly around the room in anger.  That last one is for me.  Hindsight is blinding.  Tomorrow I'm heading back to the place where they'll give you their shirt and their back to go with it if your crop should happen to fall.  You oughta give Iowa a try.

      It's Friday night and what am I doing?  Homework.  Why?  My only friend/other half is slaving away in the Home section at JC Penney's.  But no matter how much I do the homework will never end.  I will be stuck in a mountain of paper and numbers for the rest of my life.  And I think I'm getting sick.

      Remember when everything was "scarring," Abby?  And we would have group hazing and shove people off the side of the stage (especially Nanie)?  Well,  urlLink these girls  definitely need to be hazed and are more scarring than anyone else I have ever met.  I may or may not be related to the one who said some inappropriate about balls.  If I had the ability to be embarrassed by my parents, I probably would be.  But it's impossible to embarrass me when I am the soul proprieter of the "Kristin Buel All-Request Hour."  Amy says it's 11 days until spring break.  She might choke on a graham cracker and then we would have to get Justin "Heimlich" Marciniak over here to not save her life.

      So if you read  urlLink Justin's blog  you would know that he quite un-valiently tried to save someone's life.  I'm sorry, but sometimes I just have to choke.  It's a good thing I can take care of myself.  I gave him a shot at heroism and what happens?  I very nearly die.  But he irons really well, so the relationship has once more been saved.  I didn't tell you.  I went to a dog show (DOG SHOW!) on Saturday.  Justin came too.  It was so much fun, even when I accidentally kicked a little dog.  The thing was seriously smaller than my foot.  I never liked little dogs anyway.  And I met a man who sells quillows (blankets that fold up into pillows) for $64.  I made my dad one for less than $10.  All the signs point that my crafts should be making me rich when, in fact, I...am not.  But I highly recommend dog shows.  I especially liked the grooming.

      Today was a Domestic Goddess sort of day.  I grocery shopped, baked eight mini loaves of french bread, made italian sausage meatballs and a really yummy salad with cucumbers, and cleaned the kitchen approximately 16 times.  I also did a buttload of primary research, whose primary job, coincidentially, is to make my eyes cross.  It worked.  But the research is done (until more surveys come in tomorrow) and my hands are dry and all my Sims have switched houses and are making love connections.  We even had a little girl-on-girl action today (I just wanted to see what would happen.  It wasn't too exciting.).    The best (well, one of the best) thing about being best friends with Abby is that when you both have the same kind of drink (very small margarita) you both end up the same way (kind of drunk) and just look at each other and laugh.  She bought a waffle maker for $8 last night.  I don't know where she is right now.  Adhar went to Mexico for the week under some not-so-good circumstances and Abby has 80 million jobs and I talk to my fish when I'm alone, which is most of the time.  I found two mice I liked - one is blond and the other is black and I would call them Peanut and Pepper.  And then I would have Peanut and Pepper and Penny.  And when Penny met Peanut and Pepper, should would try to eat them.  Or else she would be really scared and cry a lot.  Things Penny is scared of: Her own reflection Her own bark The wind Stretch limos  Things she ate this week: Dog food A headband-style ear warmer  Things she threw up this week: A headband-style ear warmer Pieces of sock  Where the sock came from: Not quite sure  Abby's home!  Her first words?  "Girl Scout cookies!!"

      I am in the worst mood I've been in in a long time (and some of you know that's REALLY bad).  I called my mom to vent and I probably will again in a few minutes, but here's the gist.  1. There are so many people who can't afford healthcare and the government is jacking them around and not all doctors are terrible and some of them want to help but nobody is listening, so people with diabetes and heart conditions can't get their medication because those aren't considered "disabilities" until a stroke or amputation occurs.  2. Nobody in Columbia has the size knitting needles I need.  Nobody.  The people that MIGHT are going to charge me $13 per set.  3. The Women's Center told me the wrong date for crocheting.  It's tomorrow, not tonight.  They're lucky it's not a new episode of the West Wing.  4. The job hung could not be going any worse.  Seriously.  I still don't feel any better.  And I've decided I shouldn't get a mouse because I'd be a bad mother and wouldn't have enough time to play with it.  I hate this week.

      I am in over my head.  I promised to make 4 quilts for 4 foster kids in New Florence and I'm way behind (like, a month behind) and I need help.  They're really easy - blocks sewn together - and they're all cut.  If someone could help me iron and tag-team sew or something, that would be great.  I also have to crochet a blanket for the 5th kid, but I don't want to start that until I get these done.  I think I need to get a full-length ironing board instead of the crappy little one on the back of our laundry room door because that thing shakes and the laundry room is like a sauna.  My pores are clean.  So if you want to help, you + me = best friends for life.

      If anyone wants to learn how to crochet, come to the Women's Center tomorrow night at 7 p.m. for the first "Stitch 'n Bitch."  I'll be teaching.  I figured out that if I charged people for lessons, I would have quite a bit of money.  But I don't, so I don't.  Last night, Abby and I learned that plungers have many uses, including unclogging a sink full of potato peels.  All of my pants are too short.  My legs are too long.  If I re-hem them, will I cause irreversible damange?  Well, at this point, I don't really care because I look like a goober.

      I have a place to live in Overland Park.  Chrissy helped me pick it out.  I like it a lot.  I am quite anti-homework and anti-cleaning, which is unfortunate considering all of the things i have to do that fit into those two categories.  Now I shall play the Sims.

      Welcome to the Kristin's Going to be Late for Stat 250 Again Show!  Our special guest today is a test that we're not too sure about.  Last night was awesome.  I had a MAJOR flat tire as I parallel parked by Hitt Street Garage in an attempt to make it to Ad Club on time.  Not just a puncture - it was a huge gash.  It actually looked like one of the little doors in an advent calendar (you know, where you pull out the chocolate) but about 5 times bigger than that.  So I called my favorite mechanic, one miss Abby "Cap'n O" Peterson and we attempted to change the tire.  Luckily, a man who had just had two martinis and a half pound of salmon found us on his way to choir practice and wanted to work off the alcohol.  Then I went to Sears to get a new tire and made friends in the auto department.  Then I got to eat at Arby's.  MMMMM I love Arby's.  Then I went to Barnes and Noble to find books on car maintenance but instead got distracted by the knitting books.  A nice woman and I talked for about half an hour and showed each other our favorite stuff.  I got my car and came home and tried to study.  I don't have the best feeling about this, but perhaps I will surprise myself.  Did I wash the conditioner out of my hair?  I hope so.

      Stress makes me sad and lonely.  I'm thinking a lot about people I haven't seen for almost a year, people who truly know what "It's Easter!" means.  I watched the new kids get tapped and it was nice but it wasn't the same because Katie wasn't hearing Thomas Jefferson and Natalie wasn't being a spy and Leanne wasn't eating jelly beans and Jessica wasn't carrying around the wedding planning book and Alana wasn't a a double agent and Mary wasn't scowling at me and I wasn't watching a surveillance video in the dark.  Having friends that nobody else knows about is hard.  You want to explain all about these people and why you love them so much and how they were the brightest part of your week and how now it's very sad when you think that that time is over.  I didn't believe it was really over until the new class was unveiled.  I just...I'm at a loss.  There are no words for how many emotions are swirling behind my eyes, right where the tears form.  It burns and I want to cry and I want to scream and I want to sleep for days.  I am so confused about everything and I keep saying the wrong things and I just don't know what's going on.  I know it's all because of pasta and senior citizens and ANOVA and salsa but I'm afraid it's going to destroy everything else.

      The sickness is almost gone.  Just a little wheezing left over to remind me that I hate exercising anyway and my boyfriend thinks I'm hot and that's all that really matters, right?  Right-o.  I am all about the homework tonight.  I've done a lot of capstone work but still have a hill of stuff to do.  Media plan, schmedia plan.  Speaking of which, I accepted an internship in Kansas City at  urlLink Sullivan, Higdon and Sink .  It's a media planning internship and I'll be working on the Captain D's account, among other things.  I'm hoping it turns into full time if I do good work.  The office is an old popcorn factory and all the "teams" have names of the elements, and I'm on the Neptunium team.  I'm excited and scared, just like Little Red Riding Hood.  Perhaps I will make myself a red cape.  Ooooh, I'm talking to Chrissy!

      Everything tastes like disgusting thanks to my inhaltor and cough medicine with codine.  Blech.  My fever is gone (I hope - I'm running out of thermometer covers) but I still feel like I have emphasema.  I hope I can go to class and stuff tomorrow.  I've had enough of this.  None of the clocks in our house work, so I'm never really sure what time it is when I'm downstairs.

      I was tested for SARS between 1:30 and 4:00 a.m. Meningitis, too.  I don't have either.  I do, however, have a horrible case of bronchitis and the worst fever I have ever experienced (I can't even remember the last time I had one).  I'm on a bunch of prescriptions and I have a huge bruse on my right arm from an IV for pain medication. I can sit up now, which is good, but I'm bored out of my mind.  But I totally ruined Justin's birthday, so for everyone who was planning to hang out tonight, I'm really sorry.  I wanted him to have a great birthday and instead he's going to sit around here while I sweat and drink Sprite.  My body doesn't just hate me - it hates everyone else, too.

      3509 LaMesa has been the headquarters for drama since the end of spring break.  Too much like Traumarama, not enough like Bananarama.  (Did they have any other song besides "Venus"?)  I am so NOT a fan of J-Lo's new video, which is pretty much a re-enactment of  Flashdance .  But the scary thing is that her butt doesn't even  move .  Doesn't even shake a little bit.  That is so not normal.  It's like she's hiding rocks in there.  I have a global communications test today, but unless he asks us about McDonalds or ...  I just got an internship offer.  Not my first choice, but definitely a good one.    I HAVE to study.

      My normal life is back so I can blog again.  MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT: I will no longer be teaching crocheting.  I just can't, okay?  I'm tired of dumb-asses who can't hold the hook right.  God, my dog could do it.  If you're my friend I will definitely help you out because I love to pass along the gift, but if you're some freaky hippie chick at the Women's Center, I think I'm done.  Done done done.  I wouldn't mind if so much if I was getting paid, but I'm not and I'm tired of givin' it up for free.  EVEN BETTER NEWS: I freaking finished my slippers and they are AWESOME.  If you want some, I'll get 'em to ya.  You supply the yarn (has to be wool) and let me know how long your foot is.  These things are molded to my feet.  So soft.  So amazing.  Felting is great and fast and I was so excited that I kept turning on my light after I was in bed just so I could look at them while they dried.  You know, everyone has headings and titles in their blogs and I don't want to do that and be like everyone else but I'm feeling the pull.  Peer pressure sucks.  Let's say you've been dating a guy for nearly three years and you love him more than toast (which is a lot) and you know that you're going to be wiping down the bathroom sink after he's finished washing his face for the rest of your life.  What would you get him for his birthday?  (Please keep in mind he won't wear logos, has 400 CDs and hasn't read the last two books you gave him.  But he's incredibly sexy and will dance with you.)  Shout it out.

      Things that happened this week: Monday: 1. I can't remember because that was a very long time ago.  I think I had pasta for dinner. 2. Oh yeah, and something was really hurting my right eye.  Tuesday: 3. The right eye still hurt so I went to student health instead of stat 250 and walked out with a white eye patch the size of Toledo.  Sexy. 4. I went to the last 20 minutes of my stat class and scared the hell out of my teacher, who streaked white chalk across his face in what I can only assume was solidarity. 5. My entire capstone asked "What happened to your eye?" every three seconds because it is physically impossible for all of us to pay attention at once. 6. The official answer, according to Sarah, was "I was on the beach in Cancun and fell asleep and some sand got in my eye." 7. To that I answered, "And now I'm just wating for it to turn into a pearl." 8. I got sent home from the News Bureau because I had no peripheral vision and kept slamming into people and trees. 9. So obviously I couldn't drive.  I found Jon to take me home and was ridiculed.  Then I watched tv with one eye.  Not easy.  Wednesday: 10. Drove to St. Louis for a five hour interview and drove home. Yes, five! 11. Took best friend's boyfriend (and undercover ninja) to the emergency room.  Spent two hours with: a girl who cut her toe on a tanning bed, a man wearing a lead pipe on a chain around his neck and a woman projectile vomiting.  Thursday: 12. Went to Burger King with my favorite octogenarian. 13. Had salad at the Olive Garden. 14. Spent a nice time with my boyfriend.  Mmm, Boyfriend.  Friday: 15. Woke at 4:30 a.m.  Drove to St. Louis at 5:30 a.m.  Got on plane.  Got off plane in Chicago.  Took L.  Found Michigan Avenue.  Had great interview.  Went back to L.  Went back to airport.  Waited for 3 hours.  Got on plane.  Storm storm storm still on plane.  Left an hour and a half late.  Drove home from St. Louis.  In house at 8:45 p.m.  Asleep by 9:20 p.m.  Saturday: 16. Slept. 17. Had nice time with friends and movie.  Sunday: 18. Waste of time homework. 19. Made salmon and had lovely dinner with roommate. 20. Cleaned the bathroom.  Good times.

      Today was my first day of work.  I think I'm really going to like it.  I learned a ton and met really nice people who made me eat at Captain D's.    I had heat exhaustion yesterday and threw up seven times.  Probably had something to do with nerves, too, but all I know is that pukey does not equal fun.  It equals lying on the bathroom floor reading  The Edge of Reason  with the gay pride blanket draped across your body because you live in a basement and don't even need an airconditioner to feel like a penguin in January.  I am exhausted.  But I didn't cry today!

      This will be really quick because I'm (like usual) running really late.  The Internet is distracting.  I like Overland Park.  Sometimes I'm sad.  I miss Abby and Kate and Justin and Jon and everyone else that makes me laugh.  I miss living with Maria in the Crowley's basement.  A lot.  I know everyone goes through this when they go out on their own, but why is it so hard sometimes?  And when will it get better?  Advice is greatly appreciated.

      Done with school.  Done with work.  Hooray!  Graduation was very nice and I didn't hate our speaker as much as everyone else did.  It could have been a whole lot worse - the class speaker could have talked even longer.  THAT would have been horrible.  I think my shining moment all weekend was having the honorary degrees I wrote for Calvin Trillin and Jim Lehrer read at the honors convocation by the chancellor.  That was great.  I am especially proud of the one for Jim Lehrer.  The weekend was so fun.  I had a super time with my parents and the Marciniaks.  But most of all, I've really enjoyed the past few days with my favorite pirate.  I don't want to move out because I won't get to see her stumble out of bed every morning and watch hours of TV with her in silence.  Pirates are sometimes the only friends you ever need.

      I never really have anything to say.  I feel like a good portion of my life is shared with other people and there are times when I want everything to be a secret that only I know.  I've definitely become a lot quieter in the past four years.  I keep to myself more.  I like to be alone.  If I had a dog, everything would be perfect.

      Today's theme on BXR is reggae.  Wow.  I'm too lazy to get up and change the station, though, so reggae it is.  I'm really enjoying my last days in Columbia.  Justin and I went to the Vu last night and like every person I've ever met was there.  And I'm thinking, why didn't I hang out with these people before?  Stupid, stupid Kristin.  Too much homework and being tired.  But I had a great time.  All the NB interns (past and present, well, okay four of us) had dinner at Ming's last night and it was so good.  She and Kelsey are great hostesses.  As were her cats.  I could really go for a Sonic Birthday Cake Shake.  Mmmm.  That sounds good.

      One down, three to go.  Okay, so I have a few things to say about the movie  Drumline .  First of all, I liked it a lot more when I saw it in the theaters.  Second of all, Steve Fatone is what makes that movie great.  Anyone related to Joey Fatone is my friend, especially when his day job consists of introducing *NSYNC concerts.  And any movie that loves Stevie Wonder is awesome.  Watching reruns of Dawson's Creek makes me hungry.  Hungry like the wolf.  I'm making my first voyage to Captain D's tonight.  I hope they have good biscuits.  I may have cookies for breakfast.

      Capstone = over.  Our presentation went really well.  Decatur smells like corn crush, according to my new friend Bruce who drives a luxury conversion van all day.  I got to see two million fish and Boston Bibb Lettuce.   Basically , it was a pretty good time.  I got another internship offer yesterday and turned it down.  Sorry, Charlies.  I'm not sure if I regret it or not.  Largest and best PR agency in the world where I'd be working on things like Pepsi vs. a small, funky agency in an old popcorn factory where I'm going to work on Captain D's.  I don't think corporate is really my thing.  There are a lot of things I would like to accomplish this weekend, but what I really want is to see my Philadelphia-bound boyfriend.  I'm hoping that when college is over our relationship will get better, not worse.  It's like the whole world is doing its best to keep us apart right now, especially a certain three-letter word magazine for which I have some choice four-letter words.  The girls on the Girl Scout cookie boxes are actually quite frightening.  Hey, former FIG: anybody have the address for the shindig tomorrow?  I lost my invite.

      I am very disturbed by the deck crashes in Chicago.  Very upset.  Does anyone else feel this way?  A lot of other people's blogs are eloquently written (eloquent, in this case, meaning wordy and essentially full of crap), which I think makes them think that they are good writers.  They aren't.  I'm all for writing the way people talk.  And people don't talk like they have entire trees up their butts and/or they swallowed a thesaurus.  The mornings are getting harder for me.  I couldn't even put in my contacts today - the thought of having something in my eye made me very tired.  I wish all of this waiting to see what happens after August was over.  Everything in my life is so up in the air - job, housing, location of boyfriend, date of dog adoption, date of Victoria's Secret order arrival (I'm hoping today).  The only really constant thing is that I am rarely interested in what I pack for lunch and I have a really itchy bug bite on my right thumb.  And I don't believe in dinosaurs.  That will never change.  (Have you ever MET a dinosaur.  No.  How do you know all those bones came from just one animal?  How do you know the Native Americans weren't playing a big joke on Ye Olde White Man?  You don't.)  I get to see my Peep on Thursday.  Mom told her we're going swimming.  It's going to be hard for me to come back after being with her.  I kind of wish the summer was over.

      My love of banana chips is ever-growing.  I had a super good time this weekend.  I don't remember the last time I've laughed so much.  Justin and I went "home" to Chicago for his sister's high school graduation party.  Justin's high school friends came and we sat on the deck for 6 1/2 hours eating and having a really good time.  Then it started to rain and the boys played basketball while the girls sat in the garage, until the boys had to dismantle the party and we finally got the basketball to ourselves.  I also got the Stevie Wonder CD I've been wanting for $9.99.  It's normally around $16.  A great deal.  AND I got paid today, meaning I can now pay my rent.  Way to go, paycheck.  I also discovered that when I work more than 40 hours a week, I get four extra dollars per hour.  That's awesome.  If only I had known that before - I wouldn't have been so upset about staying late.  I watched "It's Good to be Britney Spears" last night.  She owns a $20,000 pink alligator purse.  It is extremely ugly.

      I'm answering phones for the rest of the day and the past 40 minutes have been the scariest of my life.  I had to call a courier, print stamps and use (and find) the typewriter, all of which I've never done before.  I also hung up on the same vice-president three times.  And she's the media vice-president.  I think she hates me now (but I stayed until 7 last night, so something must be good about me, right?).  And everyone else is upstairs drinking beer and having fun - I can hear them laughing.  Alas, not for me.  But I do get as many M&Ms as I can eat.  Fridays here are fun, especially when I'm not answering the phones.  But I really like answering the phones.  I guess it evens out.  I read  The Knitting Sutra .  I didn't like it as much as  The Joy of Knitting , but it was still pretty good.  I am definintely going to buy The Joy of Knitting.  Maybe tomorrow.  It has some good patterns in it.  I did learn a lot in both books about creating my own patterns the spirituality of craft.  I was cruising on my mohair sweater but my wrist has taken a turn for the worse and I'm off the needles for a few days.  It hurts just to push buttons on a calculator, so I'm going to get this special glove that will massage my wrist and the poor hurt tendons.  When I have money (and I never will - I get paid on Monday and then immediately have to pay my rent, which is actually more than my paycheck), I am going to buy ribbon yarn and some of the stuff with sequins already attached to the yarn.  I also would like the Beyonce CD.    Okay, I am having a really rough phone day and just hang up on people all over the place.  I didn't used to be like this!  But then again, there are a million crazy things happening.  I was not cut out to be a receptionist.

      What?  Agh!  What is this new blogging format????  I don't think I can handle it.  In fact, I think I hate it.  So all I do is work late, but do very little work during the actual work day.  I've already worked 35 hours this week and Friday just began.  It makes me a little sour.

      So before word gets out, here it is: I freaked out twice yesterday because of bugs in my apartment.  I thought they were cockroaches, but as they could fly and made noise, that idea was scratched.  I think they were cicadas.  Yes, I'm a big weenie and called my parents and Justin.  Yes, I was very upset and didn't want to go to sleep.  Yes, I am the same person who slept outside five feet from a raccoon last summer and kills spiders with my bare hands.  But I really hate big black bugs with shells.  Okay?  Okay.  I have no idea how they got into my apartment as there weren't any windows open or anything, but whatever.  And I beat the hell out of them with my tennis shoe.  So it's not like I just cowered there and didn't do anything.    Anyway.  New book to love:  Color Stories .  It's all about the cosmetics industry - how they're conceived, made and marketed.  It was really quite good.  I read it in a day.  I'm now reading  The Joy of Knitting , and halfway through, it's a very good book.  Next is  The Knitting Sutra  and then some fiction.  I'm back on track with reading a book a day.  I like reading much better than TV, although America's Next Top Model is right up there.  It was so good last night.  I was disappointed Robyn didn't get kicked off, but there's always next week.  And I think I'm done with The Real World Paris.  Booo-rrr-ing.  I got  The French Connection  and  Gigi  from the library.  Which should I watch tonight?

I have a gift. * Orange m&ms taste the best; pastels are BY FAR the worst. * I don't like peaches.  It's like biting into someone's face.  Which I've done more often than you'd think. * My breasts are taking over the world one low-cut shirt at a time. * Much like that day in European History when Mr. Burr just wouldn't let us go to lunch, time has officially stopped.

       The typical Friday of a typical intern at a not-so-typical advertising agency  7:50 a.m.  Leave for work.  Halfway there, realize you have forgotten half of the things you were supposed to pack for your trip to see your boyfriend and best friend.  Swear. 8:15 a.m.  Arrive 15 minutes after the suggested arrival time.  Only three other cars are in the parking lot. 8:19 a.m.  Check e-mail. 8:21 a.m.  Stare at Justin Timberlake on desktop. 8:25 a.m.  Start checking blog updates. 8:30 a.m.  Weekly company meeting.  Lots of laughing and making fun of everyone.  Discussion about whether a varment in a hotel room was actually a scorpion or not.  Drawing of said scorpion follows.  Drawing said to look like sea monkey.  Sea monkey is given a crown. 8:45 a.m.  Back to reading blogs. 9:05 a.m.  Type some numbers into the computer.  Print. 9:30 a.m.  Team meeting.  Eat cookies.   9:45 a.m.  Numbers. 10:45 a.m.  Answer the phone for the receptionist so she can use the restroom. 11:00 a.m.  Read knitting blogs. 12:15 p.m.  Go back home to get all the stuff you forgot. 1:05 p.m.  Come back.  Eat lunch at desk. 1:30 p.m.  Type in numbers. 2:00 p.m.  Go on beer run with other intern.  Upon return, fill downstairs sink with ice and arrange the beer in a manner pleasing to the eye. 2:30 p.m.  Answer phones while receptionist goes to lunch.  Inform vice-president that a man claiming to be his illigitimate son is here.  Both men are roughly in their early 30s. 3:15 p.m.  Watch Jake type numbers. 3:20 p.m.  Balance both checkbooks. 3:52 p.m.  Wonder if it's okay to have a Smirnoff Ice before you drive to Columbia. 3:53 p.m.  Probably not.

      This has been a freaking good day, despite early-morning setbacks.  I couldn't get my left contact in and didn't have the will to do my hair, hence the glasses and pigtails.  And I'm subconciously trying to burn down the house - I left the front burner on while I got dressed.  Dur.  Luckily I noticed it before I left the house.  Last night was even worse.  I had the WORST case of road rage ever.  Ever.  And did you know that some ovens vent through the back burners of the stove?  Mine does and I have the burns on three fingers on my left hand to prove it.  So I had ice on my hand for two hours and spent most of that time bitching to anyone who would talk to me and watching horrible television.  (Clare, I HATE Paradise Hotel.  Please tell me you didn't watch it.)  But I've been busy here all day today and I get to leave in and hour and a half to go see the eye doctor.  AND Abby has the whole day off on Saturday so we are going to watch *NSYNC and dance and make dinner.  I can't wait.

      I think I'm on an every-other-day-is-crappy kind of thing.  Maybe it's every two days.  I haven't done anything at work yet today except answer the phone for ten minutes and I just banged my knee full force into the corner of my filing drawers.  And now the right contact is rebelling.  These things are not worth it.  Except I look so much better than before.  Vanity or comfort?  Which will I choose?  Tonight I want to take a bath, play with a dog and have a hamburger and green beans for dinner.  Unfortunately, I have to test furniture for my parents and clean the kitchen.  There will be no hamburger because I forgot to take it out of the freezer before I left this morning and I don't have a microwave.  What will I do?

      I stayed at work until 8:15 last night only to find out this morning that the client changed everything around and now we have to start over.  There are no words to describe what I'm feeling right now.  So I missed the first half of America's Next Top Model.  Can anybody tell me what happened?  I came in right before the photo shoot with the football guy started.  My left contact keeps folding up IN MY EYE.  I was driving when it happened this morning.  So I'm going to get myself an appointment today to get this straightened out.  I really don't want to go back to wearing my glasses all the time, but maybe contacts aren't for me.

      Thanks to  urlLink him , I have that HORRIBLE Eddie Murphy song in my head.  Not funny.  Party all the time, party all the time.  I got to go to Village Inn last night and it wasn't nearly as good as the two at home.  I was slightly disappointed.  Eyes!  Get with the program!  Yesterday Penny ate pickles out of a subway wrapper at the nearby elementary school.  Mmm.

      Is 20/20 vision supposed to be blurry?  I got contacts over the weekend and sometimes things get fuzzy, especially when I go from reading a computer screen to reading a sheet of paper.  But I think it's definitely much better than this morning.  Phew.  I had to go to Walgreens to get rewetting drops and solution and stuff for my desk.  I'm just glad I was able to find Walgreens.  I'm wearing the red and white hibiscus-print skirt I made for roughly $3.50.  Someone told me they sell skirts just like this at Anthropologie for $95.  I bet they don't come with glued waistbands, either.  I think I'm going to embark on a pillowcase-into-a-skirt project someday soon.  If I ever finish the other crafts.  The current gift-blanket is nearing completion.  My goal is to have it done by this Friday so I can give it to the parents-to-be when I'm in Columbia this weekend, but that's what I said three weeks ago.  If you want me to make you anything, send me some yarn and I'll make you something super cool.  If you send wool yarn and the length of your foot, you'll get slippers!  Let me know if you're interested and I'll send you my address.  I like making things for other people.  And I especially like yarn.

      New feature: Things I want.  I'll just put links on here to great things that would look nice in my home or on me, and then I'll remember what I wanted when I deserve something extra-special.  Thing I want:  urlLink Female Merit Badge Poster .  Scroll down and click on the poster to see a close-up.  It's been a long week of not doing anything at work.  I know I'm always saying I don't want to do anything, but I really do prefer to be busy.    I am so glad that I now have the Style Network because it shows reruns of Fashion Emergency.

      Things that are a whole lot of no good: 1. Spending time with someone who reminds me of Erik Holmstrom (aka Homslice and Homecheese) during his "Hey, what's up, how ya doing guys?" phase.   2. Shopping when you wear anything larger than a size 2.  THOSE PEOPLE DON'T EXIST, OKAY?  And even if they did, they wouldn't be my friend because they probably don't meet my high standards of "good eater." 3. The  Father of the Bride  chant, "Every party needs a pooper, that's why we invited you, George Baaaaaaaaaaaaaanks," which is currently in my head. 4. Filing. 5. Long cuts and scratches from filing.  Listen,  urlLink Rachel , you have to love Elyse because she spends a good part of the show screaming about the Christians.  And also because she is smarter than a grapefruit.  AND she wears a very nice red coat.  I wish they could have voted off two people last time - Ebony and Janice Dickenson.  Good God is that woman scary.  She really needs to do something about that "skin too tight" thing.  Clare, I love Shakey's cherry cheesecake, but once I threw up after I ate it.  So beware.  (But I think that was due to present company, not the custard itself, so perhaps we should let it slide.)

      I have such a long list of crafts to finish, but when I do, I'm going to make  urlLink this .  No volleyball last night - not enough people were signed up to play and then it rained anyway.    Ooo, M&Ms.  I love this job.  Today is a little slow, but I think that's because it's so dreary outside.  Every morning when I wake up I think, "I'm going to take a bath and then go to bed at 8:00 when I get home."  Bold-faced lie.

      I am really trying to make more of an effort to blog.  I blog in my brain but since that doesn't have DSL, the upload is a little slow.  My phone at work suddenly became crazy yesterday and instead of allowing the receptionist to page me, it just automatically rings.  We're not quite sure why.  I think it's rebelling against all the calls I get from sales reps "just checking" to see how I'm doing.  Last night after work I lifted weights, made a really good dinner (a hamburger, green beans with parmesean cheese and corn on the cob), made French bread, cleaned the entire apartment sans my bedroom and took a bath.  It was a really good night.  I like my apartment more when it's clean.  Tonight, if I'm feeling up to it after sand volleyball (YES, I will be engaging in athletic activity.  Blame Chrissy.) I might tackle my room.  There's a pile of stuff on the floor that I can't figure out what to do with.  Mostly portfolios and stuff.  Both of my closets are jammed with clothes and crafts, so they're definitely out.    Clare (sorry about the wrong name spelling before), do you watch America's Next Top Model?  It's the best show in the world!  It's on UPN at 8 and then Real World Paris is on at 9.  I love Tuesdays.  I hope I'm home in time for ANTM tonight.    I like this job because I can wear my Guns 'N Roses shirt AND strappy high heels at the same time.  To all the geeks out there: Happy Radiohead Album Release Day!  To the "editor": Just so you know, each time you correct me takes another year off your life.  Watch it.

      Today was a GREAT day.  I was busy all day at work (and only had to call about 10 sales reps instead of my usual 30) and then I went to a mall with TWO Dillards and met some very nice mice and went to Whole Foods Market, which is my new favorite place.  The produce is so pretty and they have really good sandwich cookies.  Oooh, EL Fudge sounds good right now.  THEN the Little Black Duck and that girl I used to live with came over and we watched the MTV Movie Awards.  I must say that I am the Claire Martin (of reality TV fame) when it comes to celebrities' personal lives.  I knew who everyone was dating and why they broke up with the last person they were dating.  Love connection examples: Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore Kirsten Dunst (who was drunk like Mrs. Lenz) and Jake Gyllenhal Adrian Brody who was supposed to be dating Nicole Kidman but was with some weird blond girl Queen Latifiah who was dating no one because they made her sit at a table by herself Pink and Cory Hart  Harrison Ford, the oldest person in the world, and Calista Flockhart, the sickliest person in the world  Conspicuously missing from the ceremonies: Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson Britney JC, Lance and Chris (oh, but Joey was there was a lovely eyebrow ring) J-Lo and B-Af Jimmy Fallon  But Jack Osborn was there in all of his nasty-ass -fro-and-hot-Hilton-sister-on-his-arm glory.  WHY do girls even like him?  Mandy Moore, don't go to his house.  Don't admire the skulls on his wall.  You're a nice girl!  Go meet a nice boy.  Like that tennis player you're dating.  And Hugh Jackman's hair was so disgusting.  I'm quite eager to see if they make him cut it when he hosts the Tony's Sunday night. (Abby Petersen, if you miss the Tony's I will come down there and beat the tar out of you.  I'm going to buy a cake for the occasion.  There's a musical about toads!)  Clark thinks he will have a "tasteful ponytail."  And Mike Myers and Marky Mark were sitting at the same table.  Marky Mark is going to be a dad.  I hope he names his child Dawson Dawson.

      The adjustment period is over and I am pretty damn satisfied with my life.  My room is still messy, but I've written about 12 letters tonight and cleared part of the paperwork off the kitchen table.  Not too shabby.  I am now in love with the Johnson County library.  TONS of videos and a healthy selection of DVDs.  And some books, too.  I checked out more than I could carry, which caused me to drop two CDs down the stairs in my apartment building, and my nice neighbor came out to check on me.  Thanks, Steve.  Just throwin' my stuff down the steps again.  The rain today was crazy.  The roof at work started to leak and somebody had to get a bucket.  That's about all of the excitement for the day.  But you know what?  I like it that way.

      Two years and 363 days later, I finally realize that we'll always be together no matter what and that no one could love me more than he does.  And that I will never in my whole life love someone as much as I love him.  It's the best feeling in the world.

      There was a HUGE spider behind my toilet this morning, killed off by the roach traps.  That's where all the dead bugs end up.  But seriously, Rob, even I was freaked out.  He had the biggest legs and was on his back and flailing around and I swear to god he wasn't there before I took a shower, but somehow showed up in the seven minutes it took me to get clean.  I am, as always, thoroughly disgusted.  Chrissy, Rob and I walked for custard last night.  I had a really good time.  Sorry I talked so much.  But I just have so much RV and yacht knowledge that I don't know what to do with myself.  What should Justin and I do this weekend?  He's coming here and we've both expressed interest in "doing things," but I know when he gets here we'll just want to sleep and lounge around.  I want to do free things.  So I'm thinking maybe art museum, a walk, Scrabble, cooking dinner, baking bread,,,any other ideas?

      So we figured out that we only fight about not being together.  Isn't that dumb?  We fight because we like each other so much that we want to be together and can't.  So we're not fighting.  I have discovered the greatness of pitas and have had one for lunch for the past two days.  Mmm, pitas.  I fill them myself with red pepper turkey, bibb lettuce, onions, sprouts, tomato and cheddar.  Yum!  Oooh, I just got a package from Trailer Life.  My day is complete.  I also got a bunch of copies of the Robb Report today.  Have you ever seen this magazine?  It's for the uber-wealthy and given to basketball stars on airplanes and yachts.  Coincidentally, I'm trying to find yacht ads.  But there are bathtubs with big screen TVs BUILT IN.  It's like my Mecca.  Chrissy wants me to try out for America's Next Top Model tonight at Independence Center.  She can't try out because she's not the required height (5'7").  Luckily, I'm a wookie, so that won't stop me.  What will stop me is the thought of having to live with someone like Ebony for two months.  And I don't ever want to meet Janice Dickenson.  I'm sure she could find some great things to say about my lazy eye.

      Cars I have driven in the past seven days: 1. My car with a bad transmission. 2. A red Dodge Stratus without an airconditioner. 3. A dark blue Taurus which had "a battery that dies a lot" and, as of yesterday morning, no working alternator and/or fuel pump.  I didn't get to work until 11. 4. A green Neon with no radio and scary brakes. 5. My car with a fixed transmission and, two miles into the journey home from Olathe Transmission, a lovely Service Engine Soon light.  I keep saying that I can't take much more, but I obviously can and have.  So now I'm saying nothing.  He hurts my feelings without wanting to and without trying.  I don't understand how you can love someone and then be totally willing to be away from them (hundreds of miles away from them) for an undecided length of time.  Everyone and everything is yanking me around and I'm sick of it.  If he shows up, I might not be here.

No Columbia = no Andi, no Jon, no Kate J., no Trops, no Flatbranch, no Spellbound, and, saddest of all, no free laundry.  No!  Strike that.  Saddest of all = no boyfriend.  He makes really good sandwiches.  I would write more, except I have to check out a website called "gorving.com."  As in, Go RV=ing.  Wheee.

      When making lemon bread, use real lemons.  They're good.  But if you accidentally throw a seed or two in there, DON'T EAT IT (the seed, not the bread).  It's disgusting.  I've realized that I can give my boyfriend as much crap as I want, but if anybody is negative about anything he is remotely involved in, I get really pissed off.  So shut the hell up or I'll come over there and kick your ass.  The "Is it a cow or a sheep?" debate rages on for the second day in a row.  I think I have a job interview at a place I didn't even apply.    And just for the record, if I went on a date with Dave Alexander and already had a boyfriend, I would dump said boyfriend's ass because Dave is a catch and any girl who doesn't realize that doesn't deserve him anyway.  Except if Justin was my boyfriend, of course.  Only Justin Timberlake, Johnny Depp and Viggo Mortensen (as Aragorn) could break us up.  But I did have a crush on Dave before/while I had a crush on Justin.  I had a crush on just about everybody, actually.  But that's not the point.  The point is - who wouldn't want a goodnight kiss from Dave?

      CAR.  STOP BEING A BUTT.  I went to a knitting circle last night, and I was invited to another one on Thursday.  It was fun.  There were about 15 women there and everyone just knit and talked.  I got a lot done and learned some stuff.  Most of the women teach and design patterns.  I'm definitely the novice of the group.  But it was nice to meet new people with fun yarn.  Kansas City radio stations favor Ace of Base entirely too much.  I'm writing to my congressman.    Ooo, I could eat cookies all afternoon.  I'm in that kind of munchy mood.  I'm going to make lemon bread tonight, and I'd like to find a recipe for oatmeal bread that doesn't need to be made in a breadmaker (which is cheating).  Mr. Sessions: I will be in Columbia this weekend.  Find me.  (You won't have to try too hard - I'll be at my old house doing laundry.)

      Things you should know about me: * I enjoy any song with the words "sha la la" or "yeah yeah" in it.   * I once played a "woman of the night" in a play called  Dinny and the Witches .  See, Dinny was this real loser of a guy who takes over the world with his trumpet and a broken clock.  The witches try to regain control and the big rock on the stage caught on fire.  That's how Hammer became the fire marshall.  I represented one of the seven deadly sins, along with the other two whores, the three kings and the blind man.  My name was Dawn.  I wore a dress found in Abby's basement that was subsequently cut in half.  I lost that dress somewhere in Scott County Park when we visited Conrad, Brian and Mitch in a camper.  I'm not quite sure why we had it, but I know in my heart that Conrad probably wears it now. * I miss the kids at camp.  I'm wearing a camp outfit right now (because the interns are barbecuing lunch today and it's going to be hotter than hell) - shorts, tennis shoes and a counselor shirt.  Last summer was the best summer ever.  I still have the freckle on my bottom lip to prove it. * Abby, Melissa, Nanie and I do a great puppet show rendition of  Bye Bye Birdie  in which all of the characters (played by various dog, cat and raccoon puppets) die.  Because it is the worst show ever. * Abby and I used to be able to do the Leroy dance from  Fame .  She was Leroy, I was Shirley.  Or else it was the other way around.   * During the Abby and Kristin revival of  Annie Get Your Gun , Carin always dies.  This entry could also be titled "Why Abby and Kristin don't have a lot of friends."

      I had the nicest weekend possible.  No matter what Justin tells you, he did, indeed, fall asleep in my lap for about a half hour.  I just MapQuested my way to Starlight Theatre to redeem my graduation gift certificates for this weekend's showing of  Thoroughly Modern Millie .  I am really excited.  I am even more excited that I got there and back without any trouble in less than an hour.  That means I have 25 minutes to knit whenever I want this afternoon!  (Which I will need because my eyes are going to go crazy as I continue to enter avails.)  I'm so hungry.  I ate my sandwich at 10:45.  Now I'm eating M&Ms and drinking Fanta.  I wish I had had some fruit or something in my refrigerator, but alas, it is fruit and veggie shopping day.  I am going to have the hugest plate of pasta and salad for dinner.  I'm also going to clean out my closet and junk drawers as I seem to have misplaced a $30 gift card to The Limited that expires tomorrow.  This is the direst of situations, my friends.

      It is impossible for me to be productive before 8:45 a.m.  Kella and Chrissy came over for dinner last night and it was so much freaking fun.  I made chicken schnitzel (I can't find turkey in this town), salad and strawberry shortcake.  Mmmm.  The shortcake was kind of gooey, but still good.  I love friends and I love schnitzel.  Kella brought amazing bread and told good stories and Chrissy was so happy that it made me happy.  I like friends.  My car and I are not friends.  I feel like I've been betrayed.  It's going to cost $1200 to fix it, so we're not sure we're going to.  Little car, why do you do this to me?  I love you so much and you treat me like dirt.  Little car, if I wanted to be treated like dirt, I would date Brian again.  I had a horrible dream involving me owing $400 for overdrawing my bank account, hating Abby and Justin and New York City resembling Disney World.  I was really glad to wake up.

       All the ladies, if you feel me sing it  I kind of hate working with boys.  They repeat themselves five times in a row.  Actual conversation with a prime example: Him: "So we'll tell them about our research and that will lead into what we want to do and then, after we tell them about the research and what we want to do, we'll ask our questions.  So we'll have research, what we want to do and questions.  The questions will help us figure out if our research pointed us in the right direction as far as what we want to do."  Me: (mentally strangling him)  I would have said, "Let's ask them some questions."  I mean, when you date Justin Marciniak, you do have  some  degree of patience.  I realize mine is abnormally low and I'm trying to work on that so I can make it through a Justin story without making the "hurry up" motion, but I'm not even dating this other boy.  We don't makeout so I don't have to listen.  That's pretty much my philosophy on a lot of things, actually.

      Oh, I totally forgot the America's Next Top Model quote of the week (this is for you, Chrissy): "Well, Shannon told me that Jesus told her that I would be in the finals,"-- Elyse.  Sorry that didn't work out, Jesus.

      I've had enough.  The power blew in my bathroom and bedroom this morning (as I PLUGGED IN my hair dryer - we're not even talking turning it on, here) and flipping the switch didn't fix it.  So I put on my makeup in the dark.  And there are huge black bugs everywhere.  I have smashed so many.  They appear out of nowhere.  The place is clean.  I swept and scrubbed the kitchen floor, wiped down the counters and put everything away last night but oh no, the bugs were out this morning.  I kill one, turn around to throw it away, and when I turn back, another one is there!  I am finding a new apartment this weekend.  Wish I could say the same for a job.  America's Next Top Model was very good last night.  Adrian won.  I was really happy because a) she wasn't Shannon The Idiot and b) she said she wanted to win so she could pay off her mom's bills.  That was really nice.  She's a high school drop out who worked as a waitress.  Good for you, Adrian.  There was the initial disappointment when Elyse was kicked off, but she's too smart for that modeling crap.  Why is it not Friday?  I miss Justin.  (Who is now telling people that I'm on the top of his list of people he would want to marry.  Thanks, Justin.  I wasn't even aware that there WAS a list.)  Oh, and Britney isn't a virgin.  She slept with Justin because she thought he was the one and now look what happened.  My entire belief system has been shaken to the core.

      Why does the posting page look different every time?  It's been a hell of a week so far.  My car is in the shop with transmission problems, I have a rental car with no gas and the phone company would like me to write over my paychecks directly to it.  It's only Tuesday.  I think I like exercising.  Isn't that weird?  I don't like doing it outside because the sun freaks out my body, but there is definitely something satisfying about running in place on an eliptical trainer with sweat running down your face.  I lifted weights yesterday too and my neighbor was teasing that I don't lift enough, so I added more weight and now my arms are really tired.  Lesson of the day: breakfast burritos are not my friend.  They shouldn't be yours, either.

      There's nothing like the Fourth of July in Iowa.  Not even Jon's scary goth cousin can beat this.  My car decided it didn't want to leave West Branch, home of Herbert Hoover, about five hours into the trip yesterday, so the Service Engine light came on.  Sweet.  Something's wrong with the transmission, I guess.  I may be taking the TT back to Kansas.  Hopefully not.  We all went to the parade this morning.  My mom was in it with the Master Gardeners and my dad and I sat on the lawn of the Masonic nursing ome with Penny.  She'd never been to a parade before.  She liked the noises and stuff, but freaked out when six fire engines came by.  She enjoyed the marching bands.  When Mom came over to us, she got really wigged out and cried after Mom left.  She sat in my lap for awhile, and there's nothing better than 70 pounds of golden retriever sitting on you when it's 90 degrees at 11 a.m.  Then we took P to the quarry to go swimming.  All the little fish were circling her.    We're getting ready to go out with the gang.  I predict all adults will be drunk by 5 p.m.  My mother by 4:20.  Hopefully there will be ice cream.  If not, I'm going to Whitey's.  Did you know that if you come to my house and say "I want a Palm Pilot so I can keep track of all my crafts," that my mom goes into the closet and pulls one out?  Amazing.

      Last night was the worst.  I threw away the sweater I was knitting.  I only had about 14 inches.  I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein).  But it had too many stitches by the time I got to the arm holes and the mohair was knotting itself together as I knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well.  The yarn broke a lot.  I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me.  I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of Sex and the City (way to go, library!).  And then I got sick of it and threw it away.  I suppose I could say I learned a lot while trying to do this sweater.  I learned a new stitch and the value of using two different sized needles at once.  I learned that maybe I should count my stitches more often.  I learned how to not split the yarn (which was my problem, I think - I was sometimes doing two stitches in one because the yarn looked like it was two stitches).  So I tried to find another project but I just kept ripping it out.  I really want to make that sweater.  I'm disappointed in myself.  I'm going to find that yarn store in Westport over lunch and tell my sad story and hopefully get some inspiration.  I'm reading The Urban Knitter, which is okay.  The pictures are not anywhere near the instructions for the projects and the stories about the projects aren't all that interesting.  But I do enjoy learning about the construction of the garments.  I just...I feel kind of lost.  Okay.  Forget this.  I'm going to make that sleeveless top I linked to a few weeks back.  I'll pick up some yarn at lunch.  Anything to keep me from finishing those quilts.

      I'm employed for at least another month.  My internship was extended.  Yay!  But I just don't like working.  It turns out that - gasp - nobody does.  So it's okay.  I miss Justin.  I miss the way he looks at me, the way he pets my head until I fall asleep.  I miss the way he smells, snuggling in the crook of his neck.  I miss the way his face softens when he holds out his arms and he whispers my nickname.  I miss being his, completely his, and I miss telling him that he's mine.  I miss everything about him, even the horrible and annoying things that make me want to pull out my hair.  Sometimes when I'm puttering around the house I suddenly stop, look down at the floor and say aloud, "I miss him."  My world is a lot emptier now that he's not around.

      I have a hard time gettig up in the morning to exercise.  So I tell myself not to worry about it and if I wake up around 6 a.m., I'll do it.  That is, wake up around 6 a.m.  on my own.   Well, that bit me in the ass today.  I woke up at 5:52, wide awake.  So I took a walk around my apartment complex (which is huge, I later discovered) and it was still entirely too hot.  I am so sick of this weather.  They say it's going to be in the 70s this weekend, but I'll believe it when I see it.  My parents and the P are coming here Friday and leaving Sunday.  I think it'll be a lot of fun.  If anybody out there wants to have a picnic or something Monday, let me know.  I think that would be super fun and I don't want to spend the entire day without human contact.

      The trunk of my car was open.  I'm not sure why or how, but it was.  I just closed it.  I got a call from one of my favorite people in the whole entire world, Mr. Roy Johnson.  I was so glad.  It brightened my otherwise humdrum day.  I already hate it that Justin and I don't live within 10 minutes of each other.  I hate it even more that he's on vacation while I swelter every time I get into my car.  He better look out.  Only three more days of work.  Then it's just me, Regis and Kelly.

      So here's what I have to say today:  I went on my first market trip yesterday to beautiful...Columbia, MO.  It was a good time - we ate lunch at the country club with the KOMU sales people.  Good times.  Then we saw D's, took some pictures and notes and I showed Cindy around town.  And then I said goodbye to the only boy I will ever love.  I don't think the Missourian lobby has ever seen so many tears.  And then we went home, followed by TEN white vans.  TEN.  It was scary.  I made the most amazing hat last night.  It's absolutely gorgeous and it only took me two hours.  I Love the 70's is even better than I Love the 80's.  Can you even imagine?  I was shocked.  I'm excited for 1976 tonight.  I Love the 80's Strikes Back starts in October.    Um, I've been answering phones for an hour now and I really have to go to the bathroom and I don't know where Tiffany is.  Eek!  And I have a phone interview for an internship with Harley-Davidson.  Seriously.

      I wasn't a Berg regular, but I'm still pretty sad.  Mostly because I wonder where that professor with the pitcher of beer and stack of papers to grade will go every night now.  (But really, let's all be happy that a certain head of a certain advertising department can no longer bribe his students to give him good reviews by promising them a drink after teacher evaluations.  I still hate that guy.  And his stupid beer ads.  I know Chrissy's with me.)  I kind of had a meltdown last night.  And I didn't knit at all and it felt good.  Jon?  E-mail me.

      I have yarn in my eye.  It hurts.  We're going to Omaha this weekend.  Which reminds me, I need to find yarn stores in Omaha.  Hopefully it will be a good time, although, if I had a dog house, Justin would be sleeping in it.  I'm wearing pigtails and I've been at work since 7:45.  The day just won't end.  There's a slight chance my job might be extended for an extra month.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.

      I now know why they don't make red eyeliner.  It is unattractive.  I'm sporting some natural red eyeliner, courtesy of a crying binge that lasted for about 12 hours.  I'm a selfish person and don't want him to go.  He's better than minimum wage, than doing bitch work a few days a week.  But he's wanted this for a long time and how could I not be a little excited for him?  Because I am excited.  But then the excitement disapates as I realize that I will be alone with no job and no place to live when all I really want in the whole world is to eat dinner with him.  This weekend will be the first of many lonely Saturdays and Sundays.

      I just spent the last ten minutes trying to find out the cast members of California Dreams, the best show on at 7 a.m.  It turns out that Tony is not played like Wayne Brady as I had originally hoped.  But I got sidetracked and saw those pictures of Britney in the British Elle.    I miss the Britney of old.  The Britney who loved Justin and her mom and Big Rob, her security guard.  I miss the Britney who was nice and didn't smoke and didn't sound like a crackpot every time she opened her mouth.  The only person I have left to believe in is Jem.  Thank god for her.

      So far I've had orders for 19 hats and two scarves.  Isn't that awesome?  When I bring a finished item into the office, I get another order.  I have three weeks left to fill almost all of them (I've only finished two), but I can always bring them in because I'm staying KC.  This is so exciting!  And it's nice to have a little extra cash (I made $18 for the first two things I sold).  But I get to try out a bunch of new patterns and I am loving having so many projects to do.  And I have the rest of my knitting projects planned out, even the ones that will be Christmas gifts.  I think the palm pilot has something to do with it - I love putting things to do in there.    Abby is coming tomorrow!  I am so excited.  I'm taking Wednesday off work so we can spend the day together.  That means I'm working through lunch and late if I need to the rest of the week, but it's definitely worth it.  The ceiling in my bedroom is leaking again and my apartment complex doesn't seem to think this is a problem.  I think there's a leaky pipe in the apartment above me - the water is coming out in my bedroom and in my bathroom.  My parents are in Door County for the week.  I am totally jealous.  I have so much reading and crafting to do in the next few weeks that it's a real shame I have to clean my apartment tonight.  But I might forgo all of that and jump into bed when I get home.  A nap sounds so nice.  Bravo is running ALL episodes of the West Wing starting tonight at 10.  They ran a few yesterday, and I saw a bunch from the first season that I had never seen.  They were so great.  I'd like to tape them all, but I think I'll wait for them to come out on DVD so I don't have to worry about commercials.

      The last time I was this tired I had spent the night in the woods with a raccoon and 10 eight year olds, one of whom slept curled around a tree.  For the first time in my sheltered little life I went out on a Monday night.  And I mean, OUT.  I didn't get home until 12:30.  Ten of us from work went to Lawrence for dinner and fun.  We ate at Free State, got crazy t-shirts at American Eagle (a slightly complicated story, but well worth it) and had the Sand Bar to ourselves.  And we danced.  It was so great.  The best time I've had since I've been here.  But thanks to the stupid bug-fear the night before, I haven't had my usual 10 hours of sleep a night.  And when I woke up I was dead convinced that it was Wednesday.  I'm looking forward to going home, eating tortellini, picking up the house before the exterminator comes tomorrow and crashing on the couch.  I can't think of a better way to spend the evening.

      It has been a very stressful weekend and I am afraid to go to bed for fear of what I might find when I get out of it.  We all remember last Thursday morning's scary spider incident, correct?  Well, another one (the same kind - Internet deduction has led me to believe it's a wolf spider, which is not dangerous but still a spider in my house) showed up in the bathroom around 12:30 a.m. this morning.  I screamed, it ran into my bedroom.  Justin killed it.  So I go into the living room to get my book AND THERE'S A SNAKE CUDDLING WITH MY PURSE.  It was a garter snake, 8-10 inches long.  So I jumped on the couch and yelled for Justin.  He valiantly came to the rescue, meaning he stood and looked at it for a good full two minutes.  He pronounced all of this "crazy," as we had just finished watching Ghostbusters.  I was prepared for frogs to start falling from the sky.  Justin then tells me he's going to "smash" the snake.  I flip out again and tell him to take it outside.  I'm sorry, but I don't smash things with spines.  He gets a bowl and scoops up the snake, who then stands on his little tail trying to push the lid up.  His tongue was flicking.  I made Justin take him upstairs and outside so he wouldn't be able to find his way back into my house (we still don't know how he got in).  I wanted to call my mom because no one ever believes me about this stuff, but I wasn't about to get off the couch and touch the floor with my bare feet, so I had to wait until Justin came back.  I talked to my dad first, who finally seemed to realize that I have a pest problem.  Then I talk to my mom and she proceeds to laugh for ten minutes.  I talked to her again this morning and she was still laughing.  My mom did some research and said the snake was a baby (garter snakes are born July-August) and very lost.  No shit he was lost.  She said they rarely come inside and that he was probably deaf thanks to me.  So then I felt bad for him for not being able to find his mom.  And then we found yet another wolf spider in Justin's duffle bag this afternoon, just hanging out in his t-shirts.  And I don't CARE that I spent last summer in the woods and put my hand two inches away from a wolf spider the size of a donut and slept six feet from a raccoon.  That's so completely different because I was in their house then and now they're in mine.    And I'm scared to get into bed.  I'm scared to put my feet on the floor.  I am calling my stupid-ass apartment manager tomorrow morning at 8:30 on the dot and demanding that something be done about this.  Agh!

      Here's your chance, folks: I have so much yarn and I just want to get rid of it so I can buy new yarn.  BUT I can't bear to throw it away.  Here's where you come in: you need a hat.  I can make you one.  Let me pick the pattern and the colors (I swear it won't be horrible, I totally promise) and you can have a hat.  If you live not near me (everyone but Chrissy), you can send me $5 and I'll send a hat back.  Let me know if you have a small, medium or large head.  I have a really big head, Justin's is kind of small.  You go from there.  So let's do this.  Hats of this caliber cost $20-$60 in the store.  They're also very good gifts.  So let's get rid of my yarn.

      So over my lunch break I knitted and then I ripped out everything I had done and everything I had done last night at the knitting circle, as well as a little more.  But I did it.  I'm going to make this shirt right. (And if you must know, I had put the spot for my breasts right underneath the armholes, and according to my calculations, the "apex" of my breast is actually three inches below where an armhole should start.  They should tell you to figure this out BEFORE you start knitting - it's at the end of the pattern.  There's your too much information for the day.)  Everytime I rip this thing out I have to lay down on the floor so I'm at eye level with it.  But it wasn't too bad.  I didn't rip enough, though - I have to do two more inches for it to be exact.  I was thinking this shirt was a little too long.  Now I have to work because that took a little too long.  But first I have to call the eye doctor to find out which contact goes in which eye because the contact company didn't mark them.

      It's rainy.  Ick.  I managed to drive the entire length of the KC metro area while it was pouring.  I have an interview.  Thursday morning.  Phew.  But that means more than 36 hours of nothing to do.  No-othing.  Today I: Went to KnitWit.  Not too impressed, and they charged me a lot of money for a laminated piece of paper.  Went to the Humane Society.  Eh.  Bought a really nice photo album for $10.  Applied for a job at Borders.  Put my contacts in the wrong eyes (I think).  Is it time for a nap, yet?  Hey, Ab, I want to sleep in your bed Saturday night.  Would that work for you?

      I started an entry earlier, but then my foot hit the power switch.  Good job.  Today's my first day of unemployment.  I haven't not had a job since I was a freshman in college.  It's very strange.  I don't know what to do with myself - I've slept about 15 hours since 8:30 last night, I went to the gym and read half a book.  What else is there?  I have a second interview at an agency in town, but I'm just waiting to hear what day it is.  I think I'll call tomorrow.  Today is Psally's birthday.  Happy birthday, Psally!  I wish I could be there.  Why is everyone dying?  Justin was here this weekend and we had a wonderful time.  It's sad that he always has to leave right when I start to like him again.  We finished decorating my apartment and painted some canvases for my dining area, shopped and made dinner.  We also watched a lot of Sex and the City.  It was a great weekend.  I made some new friends from my old job last week, and they introduced me to their friends, and now I have people to hang out with on the weekend and for random girl time.  They're super nice and fun and smart and we laugh a lot.  It's nice to have friends.  Things I can do while I wait for a job: 1. Write in my journal 2. Finish unpacking 3. Bake 4. Trim and water my plants 5. Shop 6. Go to KnitWit - I haven't been there yet 7. Learn about Kansas' history (I know nothing and feel like I should) 8. Get a new driver's license 9. Fold my laundry and wash some more 10. Make bead things to stick in my plants 11. Write letters and stories 12. Finish knitting all those orders I have (I'm still taking more, though, so let me know if you need anything) 13. Explore KC 14. Visit the Humane Society 15. Weed out good articles in my old magazines 16. Get photo albums for all my hundreds of pictures.  I don't really enjoy scrapbooking that much, and I like photo albums.  I don't care if it's kind of 1986. 17. Get 300-count sheets for half price at Bed Bath and Beyond 18. Take myself to a matinee 19. Wait for my loveseat (Wednesday) 20. Clean the apartment for the first time  So, see, there's a lot to do.  I just don't want to do it.  If anyone wants to come and visit this weekend, let me know.

      I live in a gorgeous new apartment with gorgeous new furniture.  Everything is perfect.  I wish I could post pictures, and my mom took some digital ones, but I don't think I'll ever figure out how to put them online.  But here are some of my favorite parts:  * We put risers under my bed, so it's very high and I feel like a princess.  My faries (Eliza, Delilah and the newest addition, aptly named Dorothy) are floating over my bed to protect me when Justin isn't here.  The room isn't crowded at all and it's like just like resting on a cloud.  * The bathroom had a medicine cabnet!    (Oh man, I'm really sad Gregory Hines died.  He was the best.)  * We made a pantry out of some Rubbermaid shelving units, which, incidentally, are Master Gardener approved.  * The deck, the huge windows and the beautiful view.  * The only bug I've seen was a fly.  I think Penny ate it.  I laughed more this weekend than I have in a long time.  You can't help but have a good time when you're around my parents.  I can't explain what made us laugh, but every minute they were here was great.  Penny was her usual idiot self and was totally freaked out every time we opened the door.  She'd bolt and get dragged back in.  She growled at my mom for the first time ever and very nearly had to walk all the way back to Iowa.  So it's permanent now  I live in Kansas City for at least another year.  It feels good.  I still don't know what's going on with jobs (and let's not talk about it - it's embarrassing and stupid and as of next Monday, I'm unemployed for either a day or inedifinitely), Justin and I are not so patiently waiting to be in the same city and I have a huge cancre sore on my tongue.  And, in case you have forgotten, I have a lazy eye.  My mother just informed me that Penny refused to get out of the van when they got home a few minutes ago.  She's afraid she's going to get left at home again.  The best part of the weekend was waking up next to that little dog.  I slept in the papasan cushion (now known as The Nest) and P snuggled right next to me.  She's so sweet when she's sleepy and it was so nice to wake up next to my favorite girl.  I really want to get my own dog, but in a way, I only want Penny.

      Hello friends.  I'm getting sick.  My throat is closing up and my ears hurt.  Hilary gave me two vitamin C tablets.  I'm all for over-the-counter drugs.  I got my keys to my new apartment over lunch.  It's even better than I remembered.  I already hung my shower curtain (Ikea, $14.99) and hung my kitchen towels.  Tonight is Chipotle, laundry, packing and a trip to Target for food and a pantry shelf.  The big move is on Saturday.  My parents are coming to help, as is the little blond dog.  She's  such  a big help.  I put her in charge of the socks.  I bet she'll spend most of her time on the deck (deck!) in her cage.  My landlords put a huge mug of goodies out for me and gave me a gift certificate for dinner.  I love that place.  And a huge spider in the kitchen sink greeted me when I woke up at the apartment in the 9th circle of hell this morning, so it's a good thing I'm moving.

      "Being in limbo" is an inappropriate phrase for not knowing what the hell is going on with your life.  It sucks.  The Limbo is fun.  Let's remember this for future sucky times.  I am constantly paranoid that people are making inside jokes about me, so either say THIS IS ABOUT KRISTIN BUEL or else let me know personally that you're not talking about me.  Thanks.  Sometimes I think the fish and the remote control talk about me behind my back, so don't take this personally.  Sometimes I think I'm a bad friend because I don't call as much as I say I will.  But really, I don't like talking on the phone to anyone except my mom.  I was big on the phone when I was in middle school, but a manipulative boy and a suicidal best friend ruined it for me.  So Kate, Kella and Ab, I'm sorry I don't call.  Chrissy, I know you don't like to talk on the phone either and that's a-ok with me.  And Justin, really, I'm glad we're talking on the phone less.  My "angry period" of each day starts around 8 p.m., so it's best just to stay away then.  Actually, the "angry period" starts around 12:30 p.m. now, and probably will until I have found a permanent job.    I'm knitting something awesome for someone who is awesome in a totally 80's way.  I won't say what it is, but I will say that she thinks it's okay to ask people if they rode the short bus to school, too.  (In Iowa, the country kids ride the short bus, not the mentally challenged.  So it's NOT an insult - it's kind of like asking how your goat is doing.  She dated a guy whose goat died.  They don't make boys - or short little fire plugs - like that anymore.)  I have a headache, my stomach is upset and I really want some cookies.  I want my apartment to already be packed and an entire week of sleep.  I would also like  urlLink this . (The first one.)  So I'm going to buy it today.

      I had a really nice weekend.  I bought some super cool clothes at Target (including a denim blazer, which does not, I might add, violate my long-standing rule of "No Jean Jackets Allowed."  This is a blazer, not a jacket.  My father wears a jean jacket.  Mine was stolen at the mall when I was eight.  These are all reasons why I don't wear jean jackets), went to a KnitOut and met some nice people, then went to Columbia to visit the other half of my brain.  I missed that crazy backwater pirate of mine.  We watched TV and ate fish sticks.  We also reviewed some lovely pictures of yours truly, including the notorious "Kristin Doing Laundry While Wearing an Eyepatch."  I'm so glad she has several copies of that.  I am now the proud owner of a picture of my rendition of the classic Chuck Buel Shuffle.  WHY did anybody let me dye my hair really dark last Thanksgiving?  Being mad at Justin doesn't justify making myself look like Christina Aguilera before Christina Aguilera looked like Christina Aguilera.  Being mad at Justin does, however, justify creating a new boyfriend named Todd.  Todd goes to law school at Stanford but flies back here to see me every night, 'cause that's the kind of guy that Todd is.  He's also a very good kisser.  I finally made the buttermilk bread.  Mmm.  It smells amazing.  I have an interview tomorrow morning.  I need to find some clips.  Five bucks says I wait until 7:28 a.m. tomorrow.

We'll be using some vacation time to leave a little early this afternoon and go see a must win game for the Royals.

      Arg.  That's all I have to say.  And not even in a good pirate sort of way.  In a "I am frustrated and need a job stat" sort of way.  To cheer myself up, I will do the following: 1. Try to clear all the junk off my desk before leaving work.  Every day I think I'm caught up and then every day I'm wrong. 2. Bake buttermilk bread. 3. Attempt some sort of recreation, even though I generally don't endorse that. 4. Knit 5. Reserve books from the library online.

      Today has been the greatest day.  I put a deposit on a new apartment.  A new, nice apartment with no snakes or bugs or leaks.  And I can paint.  I cleaned out some drawers in the name of moving.  I talked to my parents and Abby.  I had bratwurst and mac and cheese for dinner.  It doesn't get much better.  Everything seems worlds better now that I know for sure I'm going to be here for awhile and that I'll be living in a place I like.  That's one thing taken care of.  Hoo-ray.

      I totally have a headache and I have to work at Borders tonight.  Ack.  I just want to go home and go to bed.  Ab - I will try to call you tonight and let you know what to come tomorrow, but they're not so good with letting me know when/how long I work.  I was not late for work today.  I was actually quite on time.  I even drove around the block a couple of times.  I had a HUGE mexican lunch at Manny's with friends, and as I was driving back to work I thought, "Wow, I kind of like my life.  Kind of a lot."  And then I remembered that I sit in the middle of the Yellow Pages library.  And I have a lazy eye.  On my way to Manny's, I found a whole lot of things I thought I had lost.  Jimmy John's.  The church where Jessica got married.  For weeks I've been wondering where they are and how I first got there and then BAM I see both within five minutes of each other.  So even though I have no interest in food whatsoever right now, I might go to Jimmy John's and get a Slim 6 before I go to El Borders.  And then I'll get married.  Wait.  I work with a boy whom I knew looked really familiar.  I thought I went to school with him.  He thought he went to school with me.  It turns out that we played frisbee together a few months ago.  How did I remember this?  He reminds me of the person who introduced us.  Mr. Chris Royer.  I sold three hats today.  That equals $75.  I win, I win.

      I am going to be late for work.  I can just feel it.  My new job is good, the people are super nice and not stuck up/trendy/vapid like the place I used to work (only some of the people were like that, not everyone, don't get me wrong).  So far there has been a lot of crafting and cheese, which I heartily endorse.  But that doesn't change the fact that I will probably be late.  The Halloween costume dilemma has been solved: I'm going to be Nancy Drew.  True, I don't like Nancy.  I think she's an idiot and I hate her stupid boyfriend.  But she's a literary character, I'm doing story time tonight (I think - that's a long story), and I have all of the necessary costume items - namely a skirt, socks, a shirt and a combover.  I will be channeling Jim Lindstrom for that last one.  So very late.

      Lots of news in my little world: 1. I have a job.  Not just Borders, but a really great company with great people.  It's not for sure "permanent," as I'm working on contract, but it's experience and I'm going to be learning a lot.  That's good enough for me.  2. I went on a Yarn Crawl yesterday and had a really great time and bought some great stuff.  3. I hung out with Kella last night and it was the best.  Talking, pasta, popcorn, good tunes and a feeling of peace knowing you're with a true friend.  4. This week, Penny has eaten pizza, Chinese food and a pumpkin.  The Yarn Crawl was fabulous.  We went to three different stores (one of which I had never visited), I got something at each store (usually MORE than just "something") and they all had snacks for us.  I appreciated that a lot.  I got to knit with friends and touch every fiber in each store and it was just wonderful.  I love knitting friends.  I love knitting.  I just got myself  Stitch 'n Bitch , a great book by the founder of  Bust , Debbie Stoller.  She talks about the feminine history of knitting and reclaiming it and all that good stuff.  And the patterns are great.  For the first time since I moved here, I feel like I have a definite place and am liked and people want to be around me.  I don't care that I'm the youngest member of the group or the one most likely to knit a scarf called "Ribbed for Her Pleasure" - everyone is so fun and has an amazing love for all things handmade.  Those are my kind of women.  They're also good eaters, which I appreciate.  And they've taught me so much, not only about knitting, but just about the area and growing up.  I had originally thought I was going to go back for Homecoming this weekend, but really, isn't that the stupidest thing I've ever said?  I'm notorious for hating Homecoming.  I mean, I seriously HATE it.  I hate everything it stands for and all the hullabaloo associated with it.  I think I didn't even like it in high school.  And I'm really sad I didn't get to see Abby this weekend, because she's my best mate (I mean that in the pirate sense, not in the Queen's language sense) and I miss her like crazy.  But Homecoming is a lot like dinosaurs - I just don't believe in it.

      I am once more totally in love with Liz Phair.  whitechocolatespaceegg is a really good CD, especially since I put Jill Sobule's song about Kathie Lee and some Fleming and John on the end.  I still like working at Borders.  I get to read a lot of magazines and see interesting books.  AND I sold porn.  That was probably my favorite part.  One of the guys buying it was about my age and pretty hot.  The other was rather old and unhot.  I also sell a lot of gun magazines.  I love finding books for people and it turns out that I'm really good at selling things.  I can even sell the crappy bath foams we have.  Grandmothers love that stuff.    Today I put on a puppet show with some holiday-themed animal pens, retailing at $4.49.  The dog visited Santa and told Santa he wanted a frog for Christmas, and then he and the frog sang.  And I rang up a book that was $3,987.  The woman looked at me and said, "Does that include the 30% off?" and I said maybe there was a little problem.  Then she paid $17.95.  I still don't know how that happened - the computers were kind of crazy today.  Puppet show envy.  For those of you not in my apartment complex, they're reroofing the entire place.  The construction crew is made up of men who only speak Spanish and lie in the parking lot during their lunch break, after they have caution-taped the perimeter of my building.  They started banging on the room at 7 a.m. and stopped shortly before 7 p.m.  They're all over the neighborhood, and they remind me of the crows in The Wiz.  I don't, however, think they know how to ease on down the road.  Oh, Ab, I'm not coming this weekend.  I want to see you and eat everything in your house, but I have to work until midnight Friday.  But check your mailbox Friday.  How to clean your house/apartment when you really don't want to: Turn on the Annie soundtrack and pretend you're an orphan.  My apartment has never looked better.

      My first day of work was good.  It turns out that I make really good cappacinos.  It was waaaay more hectic than I thought it would be - every time I've been in the store, it's been dead.  Not so.  Chrissy and I watched  Drop Dead Gorgeous .  Excellent.  I loved every minute of it.  I didn't even knit while watching it.  I think I may take a bath.

      There isn't much to write about.  I watch a lot of TV and knit.  Sometimes I nap.  I really really REALLY need a job.  But I might get one today.  At a large chain store which sells books, music and movies (and coffee).  It would pretty much be a dream job, albeit a part-time one.  Cross your fingers for me.  And please pray that somebody calls me back about a job that requires a college degree.  I went to the yarn store yesterday.  That was fun.  Actually, I left the house for the first time in days and was gone all day long.  I got some yarn which, it turns out, was in need of some serious relaxation therapy, so I've been conducting my own relaxation experiment.  I also bought some teal yarn, which I know will make Abby very happy.  I also went to World Market and the library.  I couldn't find Jimmy John's (I think it was a mirage in the night), so I went to Planet Sub.  Not as good.  I should exercise, but the thought of that bores me.

      I like riding the train.  I don't like it when I almost miss the train, but the actual riding of the train is very nice.  So is being home and seeing my boyfriend.  We watched a lot of baseball and ate a lot of hotdog-like meat.  I shopped with my mom (and got some amazing shoes and a great coat), learned how to change antifreeze with my dad and played with the dog.  Justin and I took P out for a big walk yesterday and she chased a bunch of squirrels until she wore herself out.  But when the train rolled into Kansas City, I thought, "I'm home," and it felt really good.  Having to pay $30 for parking does not feel very good.  I think it's going to rain.  That would be delicious.

      Today is a craft/movie day.  I have a buttload of movies to watch before 7:30 tomorrow morning, when I leave for Iowa on an honest-to-goodness train.  I have a lot of knitting to do (my love has been renewed) AND I'm going to sew myself a knitting needle holder.  It's going to be a big day.  I went to a celebration of Taiwan's 92nd National Day last night.  My friend (it feels so good to say that) Connie had been planning it for months and invited some of us to go.  We had to wear "cocktail attire" and had some good buffet.  I had a really nice time and enjoyed the ribbon dancing very much.  Yesterday I bought basket ($1.99, what a deal) to put all of my bath towels in.  I'm very excited about it.  I also went on a huge walk yesterday along the Overland Park Bike & Hike Trail, and it reminded me a lot of camp, without the screaming children.  I did see a lot of squirrels, including a chipmunk.  I made my first omelet this morning and some yummy honey biscuits.  I LOVE those Bisquick mixes.  I think I liked the omelet, but I also think I won't use butter next time.  At least not as much as the recipe told me.  West Wing tonight.  I can't freaking wait.

      Ooo, a survey.  I love surveys.  I went to the world's biggest barbecue contest last night, and, oddly enough, ate no barbecue.  I did have a bratwurst, which I like better than barbecue anyway.  I met some ... interesting? people and got hit on by drunk guys.  Lovely.  Sorry, Charlies, I have a SERIOUS boyfriend (they were under the impression that if it wasn't serious, I would still sleep with them.  Um, no.)  It was a pretty good night, but someone broke my friend's (uncommitted) heart, so we went home early, only to find...  JIMMY JOHN'S.  A Jimmy John's just opened in KC, right off Roanoke in the middle of Westport.  So of course we stopped and of course I had a Slim 6.  Now the only reason I would have to go to Lawrence is for the Yarn Barn.  That was seriously the best part of my whole week.  I might go back today, just for the hell of it.  And maybe tomorrow.  And the day after that and the day after that...  I watched  Cecil B. Demented  yesterday and enjoyed it very much.  I've managed to go through my entire time here without spending any money on video rentals, as I rely on the Johnson County public library system.  Yesterday, I rented  The Red Shoes ,  Amelie ,  Welcome to the Dollhouse ,  Charade ,  Personal Velocity , a pilates DVD, the New York City Ballet workout and Ballet Bootcamp, which I am about to try.  I'm interested in  Personal Velocity  because I read the book of short stories of the same name, yet I can't remember anything that happened in it.  I also got a mess of books.    As promised, I've been watching Regis and Kelly in the morning (while I also watch two episodes of Dawson each day), and Regis is one funny guy.  He and Donald Trump go to baseball games together and he calls him "The Trumpster."  Excellent.

I'm worried because I really, really, really want this job.  My mom sent me two books today: a knitting book and a book about decorating your first apartment.  The latter prompted me to clean, and everything looks very nice.  I'm even on my last load of laundry.  I'm making garlic mashed potatoes (more garlic than potatoes, it turns out) and it smells wonderful in here.  The backdoor is open and I'm wearing an entire outfit made of fleece.  It feels like fall.  I'm still not sure if I'm going to Columbia this weekend.  I'm trying to conserve funds and I'm already going out Friday night (with friends!  Hurrah!), and I'm not looking to spend a whole lot.  And driving makes me tired.  Advice?

      What my brain looks like: Dull pink, glistening with moisture, sturdy and firm except for a soft, sunken spot in the top center portion.  It rains over that spot, and the dip grows deeper and wider.  Or like the sad Zoloft guy.  Either one works.

      I think I shrunk a cheapo sweater in the laundry.  So what do I do?  I wear it to work.  The sleeves are too short.  I know I can fix it when I wash it again, but really, why did I wear it to work today?  I am uncomfortable.  I want to go home and get back into bed.  Maybe seeing my parents and Peep will take me out of this crappy mood.  Or maybe we'll all fight.  It could go either way at this point.    I haven't been in this bad of a mood in a long time.  We're going on 18 hours or so, here.  My record of bad mood is about two weeks, so hopefully I won't come close to breaking it.

      Who  doesn't  love  urlLink awful plastic surgery ?  I spent most of yesterday in bed.  Until 3:30 p.m., actually.  Reading, talking on the phone, sleeping.  It was a dreary day.  Then I went for a swim, grocery shopped and did some laundry.  I also watched  Frida , which I highly recommend.  Alas, I didn't get the chance to watch  Mighty Ducks 3 , as it is due back at the library today.  Shoot.  I'll have to catch pre-Pacey Joshua Jackson some other time.  I have the feeling it's going to be an alarmingly long day.

      I took a spinning class at 5:30 this morning and it kicked my butt.  It was tought but also kind of...fun?  Kind of?  The room is dark and they played great music, including selections by NERD and Paula Abdul.  I want to go to bed at 7:00.  I think I just put chapstick in my eye.  It feels minty.  Speaking of minty, if you put on mint chapstick right before drinking hot chocolate, you have mint hot chocolate.  It's really good.  It's 75 degrees here today.  I visited the sunshine for a bit during my lunch.  I wore a skirt in honor of the gorgeous weather.  It's supposed to snow on Monday.  I had more to say.

      I joined a gym.  I know.  Isn't that weird?  But I did.  Or, well, I will, once I give them the money tonight.  It's a really good place at a good price and they have awesome equipment.  I went at 5:30 this morning (!) and used an eliptical trainer for a little over a half hour.  Unlike the eliptical trainer at my apartment complex, it didn't squeak, jam or crush my foot.  And they played the best music.  I'm going to go in the early mornings before work so I don't wuss out at night.  Tomorrow I'm going to take a spinning class and I'm going to try to swim or something every Sunday.  Yay!  I just want to take care of myself.  It's yet another step in the quest to become a "real" person.  To do tonight: 1. Get prescription 2. Go to Beauty Brands and get eyebrows waxed.  I actually kind of like that.  It makes me feel girly. 3. Get my stupid watch fixed.  Stupid watch.  I haven't worn a watch in about a month now. 4. Finish the first sock.  Yay socks!  I think I will also eat a hamburger.

      I dream about Chris Bollig about once a month.  I don't know why.  In these dreams, I'm always madly in love with him.  In this particular one, we're the ages we are now and I tell him that my mom suspects that maybe we're "involved," and he said, "not anymore," as in we used to be.  And I get all pissed off because he never told me we were involved in the past.  (Much like those two weeks I "dated" Frank Butler, but that wasn't a dream.  He really didn't tell me we were dating, but did tell everyone else.)  And I was upset because I loved him and knew he loved me.  Chris Bollig, how can you still mess with my head?  It's been five years since I last saw you.  We heard you married some Minnesotan heiress.  And anyway, it was always Nick who I loved.

      It's icky outside.  I realized yesterday that Thanksgiving is next week.  I need to get some holiday decorations, but I'm afraid that they may make me sad.  Holidays have that effect on me.  I went to Guild last night and did an entire leg of a sock.  Jean couldn't believe it (she's a knitting teacher and yarn distributor and very, very good).  I'm going to finish it today - I have to do the heel, which is my favorite part, and then the instep and toe.  The crafting madness has turned into an apartment-based sweatshop where I am the only employee.  But it's so...good.  I love it.  So many things ot make.  My hands have never been busier.  Work work work.

      Headache.  Three-quarters of an hour left.  Ouch.  I was indeed cupcake drunk last night thanks to my  urlLink baking  friend.  I have never not wanted a cupcake so badly in my life.  I am, however, craving cheesecake.  And the Knitter's Guild meeting tonight is right across the parking lot from the Cheesecake Factory.  Ack.  Batton down the hatches - tomorrow is Britney Day.

      Just to make you all feel bad, I want to let you know that as of 4 p.m. today, I was finished with all of my holiday shopping.  (Except Justin, as we have not yet laid down the ground rules.)  God bless Borders and the employee 40% discount weekend.  Just because I'm done shopping doesn't mean I'm done - I have about a billion things left to make.  But at least I've spent the large part of my money (which, incidentally, wasn't that much at all.  Way to go getting paid twice on one day.)  The good people of Kansas City are freaking IN-SANE.  I'm going to stand outside of Borders now and yell, "What?  You're a crazy person?  Well, come on in!  We have plenty of those here!"  I was not personally publicly berated today, but I'm sure my time will come.  I am, however, really starting to like the people I work with.  My personal recommendations for blissful beauty products: Burt's Bees strawberry lipgloss, lemon butter cuticle cream and, the best, almond and milk beeswax handcream.  If you come to my Borders, I will let you try as much as you want.  That's just the kind of person I am.

      One Christmas gift finished, eight more to go.  And I'll probably come up with some others between now and then.  Not to mention crafting for myself and stuff to sell.  I'm going to start a sweatshop with myself as the sole employee.  How to exercise at work: Walk up 16 flights of stairs only to realize your key doesn't work.  Go back down 16 flights of stairs and take the elevator.

      Five years ago today was the biggest, best day of my life.  It's hard to explain, it's lengthy and the guy in the office down the hall is playing "We Don't Need No Education."  Woah.  I was all things theater in high school.  Drama Club president, either onstage or backstage for every play.  I loved it, all of my friends were there, people looked up to me and I came home covered with paint every Saturday night.  We took Neil Simon's  Rumors  to the Iowa State Thespian Festival in Indianola, IA, my senior year.  I was the lead female, Chris.  Abby was my best friend in the play and Homey was my husband.  Our set was amazing - designed and created by my dad, of course.  I wanted to live in it.  When the curtain opened, I was the only one on stage.  Everyone started clapping.  I like to think it's because I was so hot (the girls from our drama club in the audience said a lot of boys behind them were talking about how hot I was), but I know it's because the two story set with a balcony, bar and GORGEOUS molding (ala Abby and the Kristins, courtesy of the Cardboard King) knocked everyone's socks off.  Nobody had ever brought a set like that to the state festival.  Nobody had ever brought a set like that to the international festival.  I won an award for Best Actress that night.  That was the one thing I wanted all through high school and the thing I'm most proud of in my life.  Even though the dumbass techies from Indianola screwed up our sound during the first act and a light was too low and too close to the balcony, it was the best night of my life.  Enough sappy - here are the really good and funny parts: * Bertram's ass was so big that we couldn't get the couch into the semi.  When we loaded the set the night before, he kept looking around and going, "We're never going to get this thing in here."   I screamed, "If your ass wasn't so big we could all go home now!"  Ask Abby.    * Mike was the best state representative and abstract duck I have ever known.  And he won an award for a duet musical theater piece that made me cry.  * My "no honking" guarantee was lifted and I almost puked all over everyone.  * I became really really sick during the first act and lost my voice during intermission.  I turned into Punky Brewster and had to miss school that Monday because I couldn't talk, which was sad because I had a really hot student teacher in my speech class.  * We started the "Feed Conrad Kiebler Fund."  * Kristin Brunt began dating a broom.  His name was Slim.  * My mom videotaped a McDonald's bag for about 15 minutes.  * The best part of the whole show was pretending to get drunk in the bathroom with Abby.  Neither of us had ever had alcohol ever, so the rest of the cast tried to teach us how to be drunk.  I laughed a lot.  We would bring in a full bottle of wine (water) and for the first few weeks, we would drink it.  The bathroom was off set, and we're dumbasses.  We finally figured out we could dump it out into a bucket.  That drastically cut down on our bathroom time.  * There were speakers IN THE BATHROOM.  I could hear E Lenz screaming wherever I went.  It was great.  * There was also a working shower in the bathroom.  Abby turned it on, got wet and screamed like a girl.  * I wore double-sided tape to keep my dress from becoming too revealing.  I had scars from tearing it off every night for two weeks.  I think I still have them.  * We lost Rita for about an hour while we packed up the set.  She was asleep under the bar.    * Abby played in a curtain of what was essentially tinsel and then got yelled at by ugly Indianola techies.  * I lectured everybody on the prevelence of homley girls in central Iowa.  It was one of the most fun shows I was ever in.  I liked being the Wicked Witch of the West a lot more, but Chris Gorman was my second favorite part.  I laughed until I cried in rehearsal, especially when Homey changed the line "Is there a cat in here?" to "Me and the cat are hungry."  ANYWAY, my dad is back at the state festival today.  They're doing  Noises Off  as the opening show to kick off the weekend, and this is the second time he's designed a set for it, but the first that it will travel.  He's probably at North Scott High School (yay, Eldridge!) as we speak, being his calm self while E breaks everything in sight.  I wish I could be there when the curtain opens and everyone freaks out (because this set TURNS COMPLETELY AROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW) because my dad did that.  He does good work.

      Dear Britney, I tried to hate you.  I did.  Those three months were horrible, though.  Because we belong together, Britney.  I can't help that I like your music and GOD you can dance.  So I'm sorry I said that you might err on the slutty side of things.  Hell, if I had the chance to makeout with Colin or Madonna, I'd take it.  I mean, it's Madonna, come on!  And if I looked like you, I'd be naked at every chance I got.  But really, I'm writing because of Justin (of the non-Marciniak status).  You two belong together.  Watching Diane Sawyer last night (could you not have gone with Katie Couric?  She's not as annoying to watch), when she was asking about him and you were crying, it was clear that you missed him.  And I hate Cameron Diaz.  She's annoying as hell.  I think there'll be just a little bit of unrest to my pretty okay life until you two get back together, so just do it.  So what if you cheated - I used to cheat on my boyfriends, too, always for really, really stupid reasons, like Action Contests.  (NOT Justin, I would never do that, I would rather kill myself than hurt him.)  Sometimes things happen and sometimes you screw up but for the love of God, will you call the boy and apologize?  It would help me sleep better at night.  Love, Kristin  PS - If you see JC Chasez, could you please tell him to cut his hair?  For Abby?  Because he looks like a woman.

      Instead of lamenting my crappy dinner last night, I should have realized it was quite French - bread, cheese and a lot (for me) of wine.  Actually, now that I think about it, I could have that for dinner every day.  The chances of me being on time today are ridiculously low.  I don't even  want  to be on time, that's how low they are.

      I'm still in the land of not-a-lot-of-work-to-do, which, contrary to popular belief, kind of sucks.  It's hard to make the hours go by fast when you're racking your brain for another legit news site to read.  Eonline, I'm sorry to say, is not legit (but it is my news source of choice).  I want to make sugar cookies tonight.  With icing.  I'm going to make a huge mess.  It's going to be awesome.  I went to the Fiber Guild meeting last night.  I don't think I'll go back.  Unlike the Knitter's Guild, it's a very close-knit (oh, don't even) group, and I felt kind of left out.  And there was a woman writing a screenplay for a Pirate's of the Carribean sequel, starring a Pirate Queen who spins her own yarn.  But I did meet two women who own alpacas (sheep?  Llamas?  Who cares?  They're soft.) and everyone there spun their own yarn.  But I could think of better ways to spend my evening, namely buying the new Liz Phair CD and eating Dairy Queen, which I subsequently did.

      Seriously, I need some work to do here, people.  How do I always work myself out of a job?  My personal radio station figured out that I like New Kids on the Block and just played "Cover Girl."  I didn't know if I should be excited or really really embarrassed.  Reason why I'm mad at Target: * They won't change the battery in my watch because I didn't buy it there.  I'm sure Mary Englebreit doesn't have time to come all the way up here to change the battery herself, so you think they'd be a little more helpful.  Reason why I feel like a criminal: * Buying supplies for the party last Saturday, the following occured: I purchased $27 worth of groceries.  I had a $10 gift card.  That brought my total to $17.  I then asked for $20 cash back after paying with my debit card.  That equals $37 total that should be charged to my debit card.  My receipt says the girl owed me $3 in change, meaning instead of entering that I should get $20, that I paid $20.  And my bank statement says I paid Hy-Vee $20.  All of this equals that I got my groceries for free.  It was weird.  I mean, I got the $20 cash back.  So I essentially came out ahead (not having to pay for groceries.)  Um, I like Jessica Simpson's new song.  And I don't care if she's stupid.  I know A LOT of stupid people.

      Not counting the Scrabble game, the weekend was amazing.  I had a "big girl" party (and there's a lot of alcohol left over - come to my place and drink some beer), my friends made friends with each other and Justin tried his hand at making bread.  (Notice how I am a much bigger person than said boyfriend and don't gloat over other's misfortunes.  Loser.)  I'm eating cheese right now.  I may get fed up with Borders, but I walked away with 26 FREE CDs last night after our annual meeting.  FREE.  Good CDs.  CDs for my boyfriend, who will be lucky if I don't scratch all of his before handing them over.  CDs for my parents.  And CDS for me.  I may never say this again, but YAY Borders.

      Dear Liz Phair, You rocked my socks off last night.  Who knew you were better in person than on the CD?  Who knew you were so gorgeous (in a Sheryl Crow kind of way, which actually freaks me out)?  Who knew you were so tiny?  Who knew I'd see half the people I used to work with?  I had a great time.  You were the first female headliner I've ever seen (isn't that weird?  I thought so, too).  I'd ditch that Wheat group if I were you.  They sound like every band I've ever heard - Kella and I agreed that they were the Goo Goo Dolls, Matchbox 20 and all those other bands my dad likes all rolled up in one.  But you, girl, know how to rock and roll.  Please come back soon.  If I were into that kind of thing, I would totally make out with you.  Love, k  ps - Why do so many gay 40 year old men love you?  Dear Michaella's mom, Thank you so much for the tickets!  Kella almost busted up some inappropriate PDA, but I kept her in line.  We got our pictures taken by the Pitch street team, and they gave us incense.  Hooray...incense?  Love, Michaella's friend, Kristin

      How I spent my lunch: Shopping for yarn. Eating cake.  Good God, nothing, NOTHING is better than that!!!  I'm pretty sure that's what heaven's all about.   I actually didn't buy much yarn, just two skeins (one for a Christmas present for a certain pirate I know), but I also got some itty bitty needles and a bag to keep my sock knitting in.  Hurrah!  And all of it was 25% off!  Even better!  The cake wasn't as good as Hy-Vee, but I still managed to eat a corner piece.

      Nice things about my job: 1. Sometimes it is slow, but I never have to wait long for stuff to do.  I really like and appreciate that. 2. Lots of good magazines. 3. Internet radio.  Speaking of radio - have you ever wanted to make your OWN radio station, where only good music is played?  Now you can!   urlLink Launch.com  allows you to make your own online station.  It asks your music preferences and gives suggestions, and as you listen to songs, you can rate them, as well as artists and albums.  Then it figures out what to play.  It's great!  And if you don't like a song, you can turn on the No symbol and it will never play again.  Woohoo!    Best of all, it's free.  I highly recommend it if you have speakers.  I even got to hear Bootylicious!

      I was dead but now I'm back.  I had the dreaded winter sickness and almost blew my nose right off my head.  I think I'm on the upswing now, so no more dead.  I was trying to find a book to bring back for Borders story time (and I did find it), when I came across a drama-club photo album.  It's mostly filled with the notes that accompanied the flowers I got for every show - we were flower sending maniacs.  My favorites were of course Abby's, which often referenced the '80s and Barney, the man who lives in the Flynn's well.  I found one telling me I was "beautiful as always," with no signature, then figured out it was from the crying ex-boyfriend.  I noticed I was often called a sexy bitch, waaay before I ever actually became one (because, come on, I am.  Aren't you?  I think you are.)  Conrad always wrote the sweetest cards and VDK's were the scariest.  I didn't get any flowers the first night of my first show freshman year and I was absolutely crushed.  I got about 25 on the last night of the last show of my senior year and had vases full of flowers all over the house.  I know I say that I don't miss it at all, but I guess I do.  I miss having all of my friends at the exact same place at the exact same times every day, wearing paint-splattered clothes and covered with dirt.  I miss giving rides to the freshman.  I miss listening to Counting Crow's "Mr. Jones" on repeat for an entire hour while I sorted nails and screws.  I miss having a crush on seniors when I was a freshman and being crushed on by freshmen when I was a senior.  I feel like things are coming full circle - I'm slowly finding a group of friends like the one I used to have, who make me feel safe and warm and loved even when I say and do dopey things.  I'm a freshman all over again.  A freshman with a big-ass frying pan, that is.  Yay Christmas!  I also got some big-girl luggage, the Victoria's Secrets puppies, Max and Lucy and a Pat Bereskin original piggy bank that looks like it's wrapped in yarn.  I also got the yarn I asked for and I'm making a beautiful sweater sleeve.  AND I got a digital camera, so look out.  And I'm back from being dead.  Hooray.

You be the judge if you're a favorite or not.  But God love Kara Moran and her starfish jokes.  Not-favorite: People who are always unhappy and bitchy Trolls People who make me cry People who look like they are 12 and date "Connnn-rad" My biggest arch nemisis, who constantly reminds you she is Jewish and asks you if you believe in the Holocaust.  Luckily, I haven't seen her for at least four years. Kirsten Dunst.  She's a drunk, heinous bitch. The Backstreet Boys.

      I vacillate on whether to have headings like everyone else in my blog.  For one thing, I'm a big fan of titles and bold text to divide the page.  But everyone's doing it and you know me, if everyone's doing it, I probably despise it.  And the headings would only make sense to me.  BUT since it's all about me, maybe I will.  Maybe I will just sometimes.    I wonder what Abby is doing.

      There is so much knitting to do and so little time.  I shake my fist at you, Christmas.  Connie the Hottie learned to knit last night.  She's a natural, even when drunk on reindeer wine.  I'm very proud.  The weekends always go so fast.  Borders, gym, Borders, sleep sleep sleep gym sleep.  I also made a great batch of French bread yesterday, which led to the most amazing meatball sandwiches ever.  Mmm, one of my super duper co-workers gave me baked goods and I'm eating the head of a sugar cookie man.  It's definitely better than my sugar cookies.  Oh!  I saw Mona Lisa Smile.  It was okay, but very painful for me to watch.  I couldn't stand everyone getting married.  I did, however, fall in love with Julia Stiles' hair.  The thing with Julia Roberts is that she can't be in a period movie because you never, ever forget that she's Julia Roberts.  I think the movie had a good message but none of the characters really followed that message.  But I love movies and I love friends and I love appetizers beforehand, so who really gives a crap?  I paid all of my bills this morning.  Amazing.  I'm just waiting for the cable bill to come in.  Hopefully it will today as I leave for Iowa tomorrow.  I know!  I'm so excited about it too!  I've seen my parents every other weekend since Thanksgiving, which has been really nice/hilarious/fun, but I miss my Peep.  Peep!  In time-honored Kristin fashion, a list of things I will do when I get to Iowa: * kiss my Peep * Call Aberone * Eat everything in sight with Ab * Knit * See the gang * Snuggle down in my flannel dog sheets * Go to Whitey's.  OHMYGOD I miss Whitey's.  ...actually, there aren't a whole lot of things I want to do in Iowa this time.  I think I'll just be glad to take a rest and watch movies in the basement.  Most of the stuff I like to do I can do here, which is really great.  I would, however, like to avoid the following: * Ho-beasts * eating my dad's red granola (which is what happens when you confuse vanilla with red food coloring) * meeting my dad's running friends (who have deemed my dad a "bad boy") * Farm & Fleet and Menards  I'm pretty sure I won't have anything to do at work today.  How will I spend my time?  It's frustrating.  My job was extended through January, which is very good, but it's the holiday season and we're winding down and my boss is in Cancun, which is very good for her but very sad for us, since we're not there.  Connie, this post is for you.

      Injuries in the past 24 hours: * Left forearm - smashed into a bathroom stall/wall; outcome: very bruised, sore, and impeding crafting * Left thigh - tried to put away large suitcase/duffel bag, not paying attention to the fact that the bag is actually larger than the doorway.  Ran into bag and sad doorway, fell into bedroom over bag; outcome: my entire left thigh is purple and there's a huge, bumpy, knotty welt in the middle * Entire right side of arm - called Mom to tell her about other injuries and ran into bathroom wall/doorway; outcome: I am a dumbass  And that doesn't even count when I totally wiped out in the parking lot on the way to the airport at 4:30 a.m. last Thursday morning.  I now have a Bad Ass.

       The following will go in my journal someday and will probably end up in my mom's as well.  Writing helps a lot.   Theres a lot to say and, unfortunately, no good way to say it.  I was six the last time I was at a funeral.  My Grandpa Joe, whom I didnt know all too well but always gave me Oreos, was sick and passed away.  I remember the coffin and eating M&Ms. My other grandparents took me home early because I was trying to get into a fountain.  So I guess when I went to my other grandpas memorial last week, I expected to be told to leave halfway during the service.  I did most of my crying before it started, right after I noticed the sign that said, Service for Charles A. Buel, December 12, 2003.  Thats also my dads name and I totally freaked out.  And then I thought I saw my grandpa walk in, but it was really his best friend, Chester.  I told my mom and she started to cry.  (I would like to point out that she cried/practiced origami on tissues during the entire service, even though she said she was done crying before we left the hotel.  She is a liar.)  My dad gave a good eulogy and didnt cry.  Chester had a Top 9 list of things people remembered about my grandpa.  I looked really good (this comes into play later, when I captured the hearts of several old men).  It was a nice service.  The reception was at my grandmas house.  The bartender had just had his esophagus removed and his assistant had two hearing aids.  Revered Temme hit on me and were taking a trip his native Australia soon.  Harold the Flirt was all up in my business, as well as the business of my mother and Mrs. Temme.  Chester took me aside to tell me about his granddaughter living in sin with a boy in Italy.  There was so much food (SO MUCH CAKE!) and a lot of bad vodka going around.  (My grandfather used to put crappy liquor in nice bottles because he said the old people around there didnt know the difference.)  Grandpa would have had a good time.  Isnt it sad that the time you spend grieving with family is the time that the deceased would have enjoyed most?  Our splintered little family, barely held together by marriage licenses and very little blood relation, finally quit hating each other and had a really good time.  It turns out that we were just fighting over Grandpa all those years.  Its a waste, really.  There are pieces of him all over the house (and I dont mean actual pieces  his ashes were at the funeral home; Grandma didnt lose him like we thought).  His diabetes kits are in the guest bathroom; liquor dating back to my parents wedding is still in the garage.  Nobody who really knew him well sits in his chair and there are golf clubs all over the house.  It felt like he went out for bagels, running an errand or two.  I could hear him say my name and feel his puckered kiss on my cheek; I saw him sitting next to my dad and holding his hand at the service.  All of his friends, most of whom I hadnt ever met or hadnt seen since I was very small, said that he was so proud of me.  But really, its me whos proud of him.  I just wish he knew.

      I've entered the market.  Not the stock market, but the celebrity market.   urlLink Celebdaq  lets you buy and sell shares in celebrities (not with real money, duh.)  I bought Beyonce, Justin, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood and Johnny Depp.  Viggo Mortensen wasn't on the list.  Neither was Ashton Kutcher, which I found quite odd.  Or Paris Hilton.  Yay for the BBC for ignoring the annoying people (but Viggo?  Come on - he's Aragorn!  He's the king in Return of the King!).  It took me an hour and a half to drive 16 miles to work.  Ridiculous.  There was only three inches of snow on the ground!  All the schools are called off and it's illegal to drive without snow tires and/or chains.  If this happened in Iowa, they probably would have made us go to school early just for the hell of it.  That's the kind of thing they do in Iowa.  I don't really remember school being canceled because of snow - mostly just because of the cold and the farm kids having to wait outside for the buses.  My senior year was that terrible snow storm and we had Christmas break off as well as two days after it for winter weather.  It was horrible because I couldn't leave the house and I didn't change my clothes for four days.  Seriously.  Abby said she didn't either.  I don't think I even showered, it was that desperate.

      I worked through lunch yesterday and left at 4:00 so I could have dinner before I covered for someone at Borders.  I had an anxiety attack in the car, which was strange because I haven't had one for a few months and I usually don't get them in the car.  I knew something bad was about to happen but I couldn't figure out what.  The drive was about 40 minutes and I was sick through the whole thing.  I get home and call my mom and tell her what happened.  She says she knows why.  I ask why and she says, "Grandpa died this morning."  He's been really sick since the end of October, and has had two or three strokes in that time period.  He called my dad Saturday to say goodbye.  He knew.  My grandma was going to have to find him a nursing home since she couldn't take care of him all on her own anymore.  He didn't want to go.  Now he doesn't have to.  The funeral is Friday in Florida.  I'm leaving on Thursday and will be back Sunday.  I wish Penny was going to be there.  Everyone says he's in a better place now.  I don't know if I believe that.  What if he's scared all alone up there?  Who will take care of him?  That's what makes me the most upset.  I don't want him to be alone.  I hope Maggie and Ben were waiting for him, reading to play ball and chase sticks.  He loved golden retrievers.  And I made him socks.  He never got to know how much I really loved him.  It's in those socks.  I certainly can't keep them and I definitely can't give them to anyone else I know.  So I'm giving them to his best friend, Chester.  Maybe Chester will be my grandpa.  I wanted him to see me get married.  I wanted him to see my babies.    I wanted to say goodbye.

      Things I cannot explain: 1. Why being busy at work makes me happy 2. Why I only like summer sausage and no other kind of lunch meat 3. Why a woman repeatedly called my house last night asking for Captain Walker and why, at 9:30, I was in a dead sleep 4. Why I couldn't figure out my phone number when she asked 5. Why I wore TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOES at once TWO DAYS IN A ROW.  Seriously.  I just figured out that I did it this morning.  And it's not like they were the same height - one has a chunky heel and the other has none.  It's a wonder I didn't fall on my face.  And how come I didn't notice until today?  I did this on Tuesday and Wednesday.  I would never have figured it out except I was looking in my closet for a pair of shoes and could only find one.  The other was in the hall with the shoes I've been wearing all week, along with it's mismatched companion.    It's a wonder I make it out of the door at all.

      I adopted two girls - the six year old wants a "play shopping basket and food," and the 10 year old wants a "personal grooming kit."  Oh god, this makes my heart break.  This is much more important than yarn and anything else I could possibly do with that money.  My day is finally worthwhile.

       Being a good person  A work friend sent me a link to  urlLink Elann.com , which has amazing yarn prices (70% off on ribbon yarn!) and great patterns.  I had stuff in the checkout cart, but then reconsidered when I saw my purchase would be $40, including shipping.  (Of course, if I had purchased everything at full price, it would have been $78.)  So I zeroed everything out.  Then I get an e-mail about "adopting" a child for holiday gifts.  I'm going to do that instead.  If I didn't already have too much yarn, I would smack myself.

      I've been a busy little bee today.  I can't decide if I work better in the morning or the afternoon.  I'm definitely a morning person, but I can't bring myself to accomplish very much.  I took a half hour nap after spinning class this morning, rendering me quite confused when my alarm went off again at 7:10.  But I was pooped.  Josh Groban, I'm afraid I don't like you.  50 Cent, I'm afraid I do.  Mom, please tell Dad he left his shower mirror in my shower.  I hope he's not traveling soon.  It's a good way to see if I got all the soap out of my hair.  I finished another gift.  Two down, too many to go.  It's a good thing I don't have a lot of friends.  Dinner sucked last night - don't ever eat a warmed tomato with spinach inside.  And the tater tots could have used a little work, too.  Let's hope tonight's dinner is better.  Mmm, speaking of dinner...to the Batgarage!

      I think maybe I use this more as a bulletin board for myself so I don't forget things.   Dinner  Monday - Spinach-stuffed tomato, tater-tots Tuesday - Dijon-mustard salmon and veggies Wednesday - Pork tenderloin and potato pancakes Thursday - Chili and...tater tots? Friday - Jimmy John's  I figure if I plan what I'm going to eat I'm a lot less likely to have ice cream and pickles.  I also realized that I have a lot of stuff in the fridge/freezer that won't be used this week.  Hmmm.  Interesting.  I'm set for longer than I thought, I guess.  Way to go, planning.

      I don't think I follow "normal" American television viewing patterns.  I don't watch any of the top 20 shows (I don't think - I haven't seen 3Q's rankings yet, so maybe I'm wrong) and I'm a big fan of all things cable.     Monday  RW/RR Challenge (and tonight I'm going to watch The Simple Life - I love those Hilton sisters)   Tuesday  Whoopi Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, which I did not initially like, but now I love the first 45 minutes.  I don't really care about the straight guys, actually - I just love Carson. (this week, the new Tracey Morgan Show.  I think I like that little kid.)   Wednesday  The West Wing   Thursday  NOTHING   Friday  NOTHING   Saturday  A lot of VHI and MTV after 6 p.m.   Sunday  Mostly E! and Style  I feel that in my chosen profession, I should be watching a lot more TV.  But I hate CBS and ABC.  Fox isn't so great, either.  I do enjoy the Spanish channel, though, as well as Bravo.  So on those nights/hours when I'm not watching TV, I'm either reading or working at Borders.  Yay  urlLink books !

      Oh, I so gave in.  I didn't know there was a title bar to actually do all the formatting for you.  I avoided titles in the name of laziness.  Now there is no excuse.  Check out the awesome  urlLink watch  my awesome boyfriend gave me for my birthday/Valentine's Day/being great.  (I added that last part on my own.)  I smile every time I look at it, which, for the past few days, has been every three minutes.  Welcome to the longest week of my life.  Today is my first OFFICIAL day of being a full-time employee, meaning I get benefits starting Monday.  Hurrah!  To celebrate, I bought myself a golden retriever calendar, a pen jar, a paperclip holder, and a small dayplanner.  I drew a sketch of my ultimate planner yesterday afternoon, thinking I would never find such a wonder.  I found something pretty close to it last night at Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart wins.  I'm trying to figure out what to do tonight.  I was thinking about going to a movie, but that's kind of expensive.  So I think I'm going to have a nice dinner, finish some laundry and curl up on the couch with  Pirates of the Carribean  for the umpteenth time while I knit.  I'll go to a movie tomorrow afternoon because it'll be cheap, and I'll even take myself to lunch.  Fazolis, because I love it.

       Musicals I love, in no particular order:  Annie Get Your Gun L'il Abner Annie School House Rocks Live! Once Upon a Mattress Guys and Dolls   Musicals I absolutely despise, in no particular order:  Bye Bye Birdie Cats West Side Story Oklahoma Brigadoon  There is absolutely nothing redeeming about Bye Bye Birdie.  It's horrible, awful, and the only time I can stomach it is when Abby, Miss, Nanie and I have a puppet show to "The Telephone Hour" and everyone dies.  Bye Bye Birdie teaches you that it should be "one boy, not two or three."  That's a bunch of crap.  I'm all for two or three boys, none of them Elvis-impersonating tap dancers.  L'il Abner is probably the best, mostly because it introduced "whomp" as a new verb in my vocabulary, as in "I whomps from the branches of my Yokumberry tree."

Don't get me wrong, I heart Blogger, but I've been wanting to build a better site for awhile.  Sure, it costs a few dollars a month, but I think it will definitely be worth it.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

       urlLink Best blog ever.   I identify with this so much, except for the whole having a baby thing.  OHMYGOD my Internet radio station has me totally pegged.  I was scared after the NKOTB revelation a few months ago but now, NOW it's playing "I Got the Sun in the Morning," from Annie Get Your Gun.  Good God, do I love that song.  I especially love it when Ethel Merman is screaming it at the top of her raspy lungs.  But then the radio station plays Judy Garland and it appears that we don't really know each other at all.  I hope after my "new" job kicks off that I'll be busy all day.  It would be a welcome change.  I really need a new watch, but I won't settle for anything but a Mary Englebreit.  I might have to kidnap Beth O'Connell to swing such a deal.  I might do it anyway - I miss that girl.

      It's done and I'm so happy!  I finished my Rosedale United sweater and it's absolutely perfect.  Gorgeous, fits me wonderfully and I'm never taking it off.  Ever.  I love Saturday mornings before storytime.  I go to bed at a decent hour on Friday night, so I wake up before my alarm.  Today I woke at 7:00.  I finished weaving in the ends of the sweater, had a breakfast of bagel and cake, cleaned Roxy's tank, and now I'm going to pick up the house before I go to the gym.  Saturday mornings are lovely.  The sun is out, my toes are wriggling into the carpet and I'm wearing the most beautiful sweater in the world.  I also have plenty of yarn left to make a felted bag.  Hooray!

      Yesterday was probably the best birthday I've ever had.  My boss made me a cake, people at work gave me a card, people at the gym wished me happy birthday, my parents sent me the world's softest yarn and an Etch-a-Sketch, and I had dinner with my favorite girls.  That was my favorite part.  Being tucked in a booth with Chrissy, Elizabeth, Kella and Sara, laughing at boys and ourselves, was probably the most fun I've had all week.  They're my favorite present.  My second favorite present would have to be my birthday wish coming true: I got a job.  I'm staying at BR as a permanent employee on the Internet team.  I'll have my own clients and everything.  I love the people I work with and it's a really good company and THANK GOD I have a job.  I ate leftover portabella pizza and chocolate cake for breakfast.  Now I have to go to the dentist.

Good thing about this week: I can't work past 5:00 any day because I have appointments/plans/places to be before 6:00.  Bad thing about this week: Tedious work.

      Sad but true: after an anger-inducing day, it feels really good to exercise.  I hope I don't get struck by lightning.  America's Next Top Model lived up to all of my expectations last night.  I love Shandi, who represents all things Midwest (Missouri and Walgreens), but Jesus, can't that girl learn how to NOT walk like a cow giving birth?  I thought a calf was going to drop out from between her legs.  I hate, hate, HATE that girl whose name I can't remember.  You know, the one with the braids.  She's such a two-faced bitch.  And I don't like that 18-year-old Catie girl.  She's too 18 for me (and her face is seriously the same color as her hair).  I thought I was going to be late to work today - I got distracted by Orlando Bloom, and 20 minutes later it was 8:00, when I was supposed to leave, and I still had wet hair and was wearing a robe and no makeup.  I left the house roughly five minutes later.  Orlando must have put an extra spring into my step.  I feel that I won't have a lot of drive today.  I'm all right with that.

      This is a personal post.  Nothing too funny, here.  This weekend was possibly one of the worst of my life.  I adopted a cute little beagle mix and named her Ali.  She's three.  I was nervous about it, second-guessing myself, knowing in the back of my mind that this wasn't going to work.  Ali got very, very sick.  She had kennel cough and what appeared to be a respiratory infection.  When she coughed, she sounded like an angry goose.  She kept spitting up mucus, sometimes dotted with blood.  She was in so much pain and it hurt me so much to watch her convulsing.  The humane society told me that if she was sick or a vet found her unhealthy, I had to return her.    After a lot of tears (uncontrollable sobbing), anxiety attacks and absolutely no sleep Saturday night, I returned Ali yesterday morning.  I don't care if I get my money back - that's not what matters.  I was so worried about her, not just being sick, but how well I could take care of her.  I wanted her to have a big house and a yard to play in and someone around more than four hours a night.  I know I did the right thing.  She was so adorable and will be adopted right away after she gets better.  It was a hard thing to learn.  For the past five years, all I've wanted is a dog of my own.  It was a hard realization that I'm not ready for that - I need to take care of myself first.  Get my life in order.  I still don't even have a permanent job.  I can't go to the dentist if I have a cavity.  I don't pay for my cell phone or car insurance.  I need to get things under control before I try to add someone totally dependent on me into my life.  Maybe it would have been different if she hadn't been sick.  But I kind of think that it wouldn't have worked out anyway.  The guilt was too strong and my fear was overpowering.  I also realized that when I do get a dog, I want to have a house.  A yard.  Someone to share it with.  And it will be a golden retriever puppy.  I want to raise a golden in Buel fashion and have it be part of the family.  I'll adopt it in the spring or summer and take vacation days to train it and love it.  She'll wriggle and chirp like my Peep and she'll be all mine.  But not until I'm ready.  I was looking for love, I guess.  The people who love me aren't near me.  That's what I thought, at least.  But then I looked at my friends last night as we ate soup and watched "She's All That" and I have never felt so cared for and understood.  It's like that country song that my friend Jenny used to sing, "Looking for love in all the wrong places."  I should have looked at what I already have.  Don't get me wrong - I'm still obsessed with dogs and look forward to the day I have my own.  I will always feel guilty and ashamed of what I did - getting a dog without really thinking - and I hope to God Ali finds a family who can love her and take care of her better than I could.  I feel like a horrible person and I'm dealing with a lot of self-loathing right now.  But I will get past this.  End of serious post.

      If Justin wasn't such a good copy-editor, I would be constantly stuck in parenthesis.  I'm going to go dog hunting tomorrow.  For a dog of my own.  Not like actual hunting.  Did I tell you that I don't work at Borders anymore?  I walked in last Saturday and they're like, oh, you only work an hour a week now, and I was like, whatever.  So I do story time for an hour.  That's it.  Profitable?  No.  Fun?  Yes.  This week we're reading about dinosaurs, even though I don't believe in them.

      I just ate some really colorful cake.  The frosting was colorful, not the cake itself.  Now I don't feel so good.  I can't tolerate the cake like I used to.  I used to be all about cake all the time.  But I had some last night and then I had some today.  Maybe I'm not a cake girl anymore.  Lord help us all.

      Abby gave me The Sims Vacation for my birthday.  I'm afraid I will never leave my house again.  It has a Yeti!  And you can sleep in an Igloo and steal food from other Sims!  I can't wait!

      I'm not  urlLink the music blogger , but every time I hear Coldplay's "A Rush of Blood to the Head," ("I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war") I think of the SNL NPR sketch where - oh, crap, who was it - Danny Devito was the guest and the apocolypse came and the studio exploded and they were all in rubble and Danny Devito said, "If I had a gun, I'd eat it."  I laughed for about two days after that.  God, that's funny.

      I totally stole this from Joanna Carter.     1. What did you do in 2003 that you?d never done before?  Moved to a new city, had three different jobs, none of them permanent, lived completely alone.   2. Did you keep your New Year?s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?  I have no idea what my New Year's resolutions were last year.  I think to not die.  And I succeeded.   3. Did anyone close to you give birth?  Nope.   4. Did anyone close to you die?  My Grandpa.   5. What countries did you visit?  Just here.   6. What would you like to have in 2004 that you lacked in 2003?  A job and a dog of my own.   7. What date from 2003 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?  December 12.  My Grandpa's funeral and the day I saw the words, "Memorial Service for Charles Albert Buel, December 12, 2003."  That's my dad's name.   8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?  Sitting at home on a Saturday night, watching TV and knitting happily all by myself.   9. What was your biggest failure?  Not getting jobs because I wasn't pretty enough or wearing clothes the interviewer liked.  Seriously.  It's happened twice.   10. Did you suffer illness or injury?  I went to the hospital for a 106 degree fever.  They thought I had SARS or mono.  I really had a respiratory infection.   11. What was the best thing you bought?  My own sheets - no more castoffs from my parents.  And my couches.  And so much yarn.  SO MUCH YARN!   12. Whose behavior merited celebration?  Justin.  His year was harder than mine and I was a total bitch a lot of the time.  He never walked away.   13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?  The people who didn't hire me for stupid reasons.  And, unfortunately, Justin.   14. Where did most of your money go?  Rent.   15. What did you get really, really excited about?  Knitting, gorgeous yarn and The Sims.   16. What song will always remind you of 2003?  Any song by Liz Phair   17. Compared to last year, are you:   a) happier or sadder?  Less stressed and more content.  b) thinner or fatter?  Who knows.  My breasts are enormous but I eat a lot better and exercise more.  c) richer or poorer?  Richer, but spending more money on living.   18. What do you wish you?d done more of?  Drinking.   19. What do you wish you?d done less of?  Fighting with Justin.   20. How did you spend Christmas?  With my parents and Peep.   21. Creamy or crunchy peanut butter?  Crunchy.    22. Did you fall in love in 2003?  I think I examined being in love in 2003 and wondered why it's so hard.   23. How many one-night stands?  None.  Sigh.   24. What was your favorite TV program?  America's Next Top Model   25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn?t hate this time last year?  Hmm.  I'm a big hater, actually, but I can't think of anyone.   26. What was the best book you read?  Um...I read so many but I can never remember the titles/what they're about.  I know I really liked The Devil Wears Prada.   27. What was your greatest musical discovery?  Liz Phair (I had her CDs for years but never listened much)   28. What did you want and get?  Kisses from my Peep.   29. What did you want and not get?  To be in the same area code as Justin.   30. What was your favorite film of this year?  I have no idea.  Did I see any movies?  Wait - Pirates of the Carribean!   31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?  I had people over and Abby and I were the only ones who drank.  It was great.  I was 22.   32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?  Having a consistent job with a health plan.   33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2003?  If my mom didn't throw it out of my closet, wear it.   34. What kept you sane?  Knitting   35. Which celebrity did you fancy the most?  Johnny Depp   36. What political issue stirred you the most?  Gay marriage.  Come on, if I'm going to marry Abby, I at least want it to be legal.   37. Who did you miss?  Kate J., my parents, Justin, Abby   38. Who was the best new person you met?  If I name just one, I will get my ass kicked.  Connie, Elizabeth and Sara.   39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2003:  There is no use in worrying.  Go eat some cake.   40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:  "I wanna be cool, tall, vulnerable and lucious, I would have it all if I only had this much."

      Songs that used to apply to me and I hope apply to me again by the end of the day: "I'm so Happy," by Jill Sobule "With You," by Jessica Simpson "Green Eyes," by Coldplay  Dear God, I will accomplish nothing today.  I can't even think.  The things I think are bad and make me sad.  I feel like I'm trapped in a bowl of Jello.

      I have forgotten my own phone number.    Overheard: "If Rose met Jesus, she would tell him to get off that cross and get his ass to work."  After calling three wrong numbers, I finally got the right one.  Mine.  Jesus.

      My day is all jacked up.  Abby's coming tonight (yay!) but I have so much work to do (no!), so no lunch, no knitting tonight.  Just work and Abby.  And that's okay with me.  I have a To Do list but there is no more room on that sheet of paper.  My socks are still cute.

      OH GOD  urlLink this  is great.  I'm totally doing it.  I'm having a good day.  Very busy.  Friends back from Haiti playing tricks on everyone (and will get themselves tricked, mark my word).  I'm wearing hot pink, brown and lime green argyle socks.    Tonight is the first knitting night at  urlLink Urban Arts and Crafts .  We'll see how it goes.

      Damn you, comments!  TV shows I currently love: America's Next Top Model (starts tonight!) Viva La Bam  I thought there were more.  Hmm.  I'm looking forward to the next season of Newlyweds.  I think it starts next week.  I also love the Today show, even though they all ask leading questions and Matt Lauer can't get any of his interviewees to shut up long enough for him to ask questions.  I especially love when Katie Couric makes bad jokes.  And I love Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi, almonds, chicken pizza, Little Debbie cookie sandwiches, and feta.  And organic corn chips.  My sweater is coming alone nicely.  I'm at inch 11 or so, I think.  I'm very proud that I can read and understand the pattern.  Nine more days until my birthday and until the sweater needs to be done.  I think I can do it.  It's only going to be 23", and the sleeves are already done.  After that: socks.  Or arm warmers.  And I would just like to say that I heartily endorse all forms of warmers, including leg.  They may be 80s, but any fashion made popular by Get In Shape Girl is all right by me.  I've been playing The Sims a lot.  Obsessively.  I made a couple, Hakeem and Honor Dashiki, and they died in a tragic campfire accident in their backyard.  The grim reaper showed up and everything.  So Michael Bachelor moved into their house.  Honor's ghost keeps coming back.  Michael cries all the time because he has no friends and his house caught on fire.  It took forever to clean up.  But Michael has stopped crying and is a psychic.  He wears a large gold chain.  He's wooing Mrs. Valentino, who's husband, Rudy, is a dirty cheater with Bella the Slut from down the street.  (I turned the Valentino's mansion into a duplex after they stopped getting along, which was pretty much immediately.)  I get sucked into that game every time I sit down.  I try to play for only a half hour, and two hours later I'm still going strong.  It's too bad my regular work day isn't like that.

      It's been a good, busy day, and now I'm killing time until 5:00.  For some reason, I find that incredibly stupid.  Shouldn't I just leave when I'm done?  It will save them money and save me from traffic.  But until 5:00 I will wait.  I was thinking about starting one of those "100 Things to Know About Me" lists, but I figure I've already shared a lot of stuff sans numbering.  So I will continue to share and forget the numbers.  In high school, everyone I knew had a nickname: Nanie, Brummy-T, Rent, Miss, Psally, Mitchy-Mitch (aka Petty Theft), Homey (aka Homeslice, Homecheese), Krunt, Hammer, VDK (agh!), Smack, Orsk, Wank, Chuck B. and Mrs. B (my parents, aka The Bs).  And I was always Buel or Buelly.  Nobody used my first name again until I got to college.  And now I don't have a nickname.  My mom wanted a cool name a few years ago, something she defined as "a bowler name."  So I started calling her Big Mar.  I can't remember what she actually wanted to be called - Flash? - but Big Mar was much better.  Oh good.  Now I have to work late.

      I'm back.  I don't post when I'm especially upset/depressed, so suffice it to say, things haven't been that good.  Oh well.  It will pass.  I cleaned the entire apartment last night.  I unloaded the dishwasher, did three loads of laundry, cleaned the bathroom, cleared off the kitchen table (which is actually a lot larger than I thought it was), vaccuumed, changed my sheets, took out all the garbage - I was a maniac.  Things look very nice now.  I took pictures of my apartment this morning, and I hope to post all of my pictures this weekend.  Keep an eye out.  I've been working on the Rosedale United sweater.  The sleeves are done and I'm about two inches into the body.  I would be further along, but I had to rip out the first three inches because it was all twisted (I love working in the round, but that's a decidedly unpleasant consequence).  I'm hoping to finish it before my birthday.  I have 13 days.   Can I do it?  I'm on a self-imposed Yarn Diet.  I WILL NOT purchase any new yarn until I finish the sweater, the green tank and some socks for myself.  I love making things for other people, but I'm kind of tired of it as of late.  It's Me time.  Don't worry - I'm sure I'll get sick of myself soon.

      I have a horrible, huge, nasty headache.  The day has gone fast until now.  I was in meetings with a very attractive young man (we don't get a lot of those around here - our floor is 90% women) and he took us all out to lunch at McCormick and Schmidt's, where I had blackened fish tacos.  Mmmm.  Then we got "chocolate bags" for dessert.  It's actually a bag made out of Belgian chocolate, filled with white chocolate mousse, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and whipped cream.  We got four to split between 13 people.  Heaven.  Absolute heaven.  The waitress (dressed all in chef's whites) said they sold 240 of those on Valentine's Day.  We talked to and from lunch, which was really great.  So nice to be outside and it wasn't far at all.  I might start taking walks during lunch when it gets a little warmer.  Then I went to an online meeting about this company that tracks e-newsletters.  It was so interesting.  The guy who started the company just started subscribing to e-mails in September and he tracks where they're from, how he got on the list, the advertisers, the agencies, everything.  And to think he probably started it all on an Excel spreadsheet.  But my head hurts and there's an hour and a half of work left.  I have phone calls to make, but Friday afternoons are always bad for that.

      I'm having a frustrating day.  I went to the personal trainer last night.  He's really nice and kind of a goober, which I can identify with.  We laughed a lot and he kept trying to get me to eat cookies (for real).  Unfortunately, contrary to what I previously thought, I am in "poor" health according to my BMI or whatever and the fitness test (which he said he didn't make hard enough for me).  So we made a goal.  Goals are good.  I didn't really have one before.  I felt good while I was there, but when I came home I just hated myself.  How did I get to be like this?  Actually, I've always been like this, except for my summer at camp.  Maybe if I stay in the 100 degree sun all day with 60 screaming kids I'll like the way I look again.  Anyway.    I watched  Two Weeks Notice .  LOVED it.  I actually laughed out loud, especially when someone asked Hugh Grant if they could get him anything and he said, "Yes, actually, a Milk Dud would be quite nice."  I made some of that New Orleans rice for dinner with shrimp and good lord was it hot.  But really good.  This morning, I made a smoothie with frozen strawberries, milk and a little bit of sugar.  And then I dumped the entire thing on the counter.  All of it.  But don't think for a minute that I didn't drink it.  Because I did and it was good.  And now I know how to not take apart my blender.  It took me 20 minutes to drive a half mile this morning.  Swear.  I don't think I really noticed because I was listening to my favorite radio station and the DJs were getting drunk at a Kegs and Eggs with the Get Up Kids.  It was entertaining, to say the least.  I'm glad it's Friday.  I have four old kitchen chairs I need to get rid of, but I don't really think they'll fit into my car.  I have a bunch of little things to do at work today, but I'm going to be in meetings nearly the entire day.  Luckily, Justin moves here today.  I hope it's a good weekend.  I hope I get to sleep a lot and finally get my house picked up.  I hope that little brown bird with the red chest is in the birdfeeder when I get home.  I love that bird.

      Let's play a fun game.  I got an e-mail from the lovely Beth O'Connell of Mary Englebreit fame along the general lines of "You know you graduated from Mizzou when..." and then had all the stuff that's special about Mizzou.  But I wasn't in sorority and definitely not in a fraternity.  I was, if I recall, in the FARCternity.  So let's make a list called "You know you lived in FARC when..."  Add yours to the comments.  You know you lived in FARC when... 1. The first person you see (and smell) in the morning is a man named Big Jim 2. The third floor residents sleep with both boys AND girls 3. The phrase "Johnny's coming," can clear a hall (and shut the door to 113 McDavid) 4. The atheltic teams are named "The Mother FARCers." 5. Frankie D shows up without a shirt.  For the second time in a week.

      I just have to remind the world that I LOVE NETFLIX AND IT LOVES ME.  On deck:  Two Weeks Notice ,  Bend it Like Beckham  and disc 3 of  Sex and the City  season 3 (for some reason, I saw disc two, in like, August or something).  Next week (also known as "in the hole"):  Y Tu Mama Tambien ,  Pieces of April  and  Blast! .  We're going to Jimmy John's today!  I might make Jimmy a valentine - I love him THAT much.  Now I must finish a Power Point.  I'm glad they made me do it in college, but I'm not glad I have to do it.  Did anyone use that Apple program in 8th grade computer class like I did?  It was like Power Point, but inherently cooler.  You had to link the pages and stuff but could make Choose Your Own Adventure stories.  I made one about a butler using Clip Art.  His name was Chives.  Where's the program now?  It was kind of like designing a web page only not.

      My right foot is asleep.  Another day in front of the computer.  It's no wonder I don't use the one I have at home - I'm at this one for at least 7.5 hours a day.  Things I could do to cheer me up: 1. Take a bath 2. Drink hot chocolate 3. Talk to Abby 4. Bake cookies 5. Clean the house 6. Finish the laundry  Things I will probably do: 1. Go to sleep as soon as I get home from the gym  Speaking of the gym, I have a session with a personal trainer tonight.  I'm not looking forward to it.  He asked me what my goals were and I told him "To not look like this."  Not exactly specific, but exactly what I'm looking for.  It's going to be embarrassing - there's going to be measurements and weighing and that encompasses all of the things in life I'm insecure about (in addition to being a 12-foot tall Wookie).  Even though I'm not knitting, I really want to buy some yarn.

       I'm probably going to offend your or make you laugh really hard.  I was thinking a lot about  The Passion of the Christ  yesterday on my way home from work because people on the radio kept yelling about it (and continued this morning and will probably continue for many days to come).  And everyone's all up in arms about people blaming the Jews.  I do not have anything against Jewish people, okay?  Not a thing.  Love those dredels, love the bagels, love everything about them.  I am jealous of the holidays and the sense of tradition and family that comes along with that label.   Having no concrete religion myself, I can't judge.  But I've known a lot (read: two) of Jewish people who are just really horrible.  Not because they are Jewish, but because they are bitchy as hell.  Case in point: my arch nemesis, SZ.  She had this habit of accusing people that they didn't believe in the Holocaust, for no apparent reason.  A dialogue:  (On the way to journalism camp before my senior year in high school) Sarah: I don't know why people get so upset about differences in religion.  Want some chips? SZ: Are you saying you don't believe in the Holocaust?  How can you say that? Sarah: No, I'm saying some people get worked up. SZ: Jewish people?  Is that what you're saying?  You know, it's because of people like you that the Holocaust doesn't get the respect it deserves.  And on and on until Sarah told SZ to shut the hell up and give back the chips.  And then, AND THEN, I went to college, rid of SZ forever.  Two years later, one of my residents (who dates boys, makes out with them in the hall and then dumps them a few months later when she suddenly realizes they're not Jewish) comes up to me and says, "I was at [college name] over the weekend.  I went to this Jewish fraternity party and met a girl from Bettendorf, SZ."  Me: "Lucky you."  Resident: "She really hates you."  Me: "And I really hate the way she moves her hair into place ONE STRAND AT A TIME!"  Well, no, I probably said something along the lines of, "She can't hate me more than I hate her."    Did we need to tell me that she hated me?  I was well aware.  Well aware.  I can still feel her pointy little eyes sending hate stares to me this day.  Anyway.  I'm not going to see that movie.  And I don't blame the Jews.  I blame SZ because she made me to go to her bat mitzvah and bring her a stupid present and nobody gave me any gifts when I became a woman.  Except I did see the Beach Boys the same day I got my period for the first time.  Perhaps that's gift enough.  Thanks for listening.   Sit on it  I'm looking for new kitchen chairs.  Mine have been around since well before I was born and I'm afraid someone's going to fall through.  I'm sad Sara got kicked off.  I think I would have booted Joanna simply for falling on her ass.  She reminds me of Elyse, but not nearly as smart/sarcastic.  I want Shandi to win but I want her to stop fighting with her boyfriend, because that is so something I would do and totally embarrassing.

      So slow.  I know there's a lot to do, but I can't do it until somebody tells me what it is.    I think knitting and I are on a break.  I'm just not into it.  I'm not into much of anything.  Not in a depressed-I-hate-everything-especially-my-boyfriend-and-my-job-and-why-can't-I-sleep-all-day sort of way.  I do, in fact, love my boyfriend madly and don't really mind working.  It's more of a God-I-love-this-couch-and-blanket-and-big-TV sort of thing, the kind of happiness and feeling of contentment when I can just  be .  I haven't played the Sims in more than two weeks.  My level of happiness is inversely proportional to the amount of hours I spend playing The Sims.  (The Sims do not cause the unhappiness, but rather keep me from noticing it.)  So tonight I'm going to go to the gym (Tuesday and Saturday are weight lifting days, Sunday and Thursday are Move Your Sorry - But Quite Nice - Ass Days), make a really yummy pizza featuring pesto, onions and mushrooms, take a delicious bath with lots of bubbles and watch ANTM and Queer Eye in a horizontal position.  Then I will snuggle into my big big bed with the six stuffed animals (Lola, Max, Lucy, Truman, Bunny and, of course, Mortimer) and we will dream of coulds and sun and boyfriends who smell like really good laundry detergent.

       No, not the epic novelist  I sometimes find it hard to believe that the lovely, darling boy who used to call his Grandmother from the Maneater office and was absolutely charming as he said the raunchiest things I've ever heard actually made it.  But then you read his  urlLink writing  and it's not hard to believe at all.  It's everything you always expected.  I was a kitchen demon last night.  I made French bread, some horrendous, horrid cookies that made my oven smoke/steam up the entire apartment for hours, and cut up all the vegetables in the house in preparation for the rest of the week's meals.  I was going to make pizza dough, but I had already washed the KitchenAid bowl about five times and the bad cookies (made with only two tablespoons of flour) broke my spirit.  So I'll just make it when I get home, pick up the 20 magazines on my coffee table while it rises, and have some kick-ass pizza.  I've been watching the RR/RW Inferno (or, according to Darrell, Infwerno), and I'm wholey unimpressed.  I hate Coral with a burning passion only matched by my hatred for The Gap.  I really hate having to go through two challenges before someone is voted off.  I'm about to vote all of them off, especially Julie.  The only one I would keep is Timmy.  I would marry Timmy, even if he is 35.  I'm glad it's ANTM night.  If Camille doesn't get voted off, I'm going to put my foot through the TV.

       So frustrated that if I don't calm down soon I'm going to eat all 10 Crunchy Snickers bars in the vending machine.     You are interchangeable. Fun, free, and into everything, you've got every eventuality covered and every opportunity just has to be taken. Every fiber is wonderful, and every day is a new beginning. You are good at so many things, it's amazing, but you can easily lose your place and forget to show up. They have row counters for people like you!    urlLink   What kind of knitting needles are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Why do people assume I know things?  Why do other people assume I can find them out before 5:00?  Why do people assume I have nothing else to do?  Why do I only have to Smirnoff's in my fridge?  It's going to take a lot more than that for me to forget today.

      The Bs were here and gone.  My mom is indeed in worse shape than I imagined, which really isn't all that bad at all.  Penny jumped on my head.  She also rolled in poop (not her own) and ate a bar of soap.  It was a big weekend for Penny.  So I spent yesterday, after they left, sleeping and making a mess.  I also went to the gym, had some birthday cake ice cream (best ice cream ever) and went to the grocery store.  I spent a lot of money online and felt pretty damn good about it and watched five episodes of "Sex and the City" Season 3.  I watched  thirteen  before my parents got into town Friday night.  Seventh graders having sexed, getting pierced and tatooed, selling drugs, cutting themselves, jumping on the hot 18 year-old next door - intense.  We went to the mall the next day and I saw those girls and realized that they do, indeed, exist.  And it freaked the hell right out of me.  It was a good movie in a horrifying, "thank-goodness-I'm-not-13" kind of way.

      Today started really well, but somehow my enthusiasm has waned.  I'm tired, I don't feel well and I don't want to go home and vaccuum.  My right wrist is killing me, which is not good news on the knitting front.  Too much calculator this morning, I think, and I still have quite a bit to go.  If anyone had told me a year ago I'd be working with numbers eight hours a day, I would have smacked them in the face.  But I like it.  I guess I like figuring out what the numbers mean.  For the record, Coca-Cola makes me sick.  As in, physically ill.  I've had it the past two days and I've felt like crap the past two days.  Not my friend.

       How did I get lost  on the way to work this morning?  I drove the same way I've driven since October.  How?  How did I do that?  It must be something like the way I got stuck in three - three! - parking lots last night.  I hope I don't have to drive a lot this weekend.   I bought Quicken  last night to help me keep track of my finances.  It's great.  I downloaded my bank statements and was able to categorize all of my expenditures.  And just so you know, I've only spent $35 on yarn since January 1.  So leave me alone about it.  It's a great program, though - I can keep track of my many bank accounts and create budgets and even print out checks if I want.  Yay for Quicken and yay for the old man at Office Depot who was so nice that I decided to buy something from his store.  I also purchased an answering machine last night, a working one this time, so please feel free to call.   My first Netflix movies came yesterday.   I already love Netflix.  Best thing ever.  I watched "How to Deal" starring Mandy Moore.  I love Mandy but she needs to not be in movies.  Luckily, I also love Alison Janey, and she should be in every movie.  There was a lot of good use of good music, though - Liz Phair, The Flaming Lips and some others.  There was also good use of dead boyfriends and pregnant high schoolers.  I was very glad Mandy didn't die - I couldn't handle that again.  Tonight I will watch season 3 of "Sex and the City" and this weekend, "thirteen."  God bless you, Netflix.   Peepto  comes tonight!  I can't wait to sleep with her in The Nest.  I love that dog.

       It's been brought to my attention  that I'm pushy.  I retorted with, "Why are you such a jackass?", later realizing that makes me both pushy  and  a bitch.  I just want to help.  I want to make things easy.  I'm sorry, Pookie.  For real?  For real.   I'm glad  Catie got voted off last night.  I kind of want to go to the chat on the UPN website at 1:30 today just to tell her how much I hate her.  I hate her ugly crying face and I hate her nasty short blond hair and she just sucks in general.  SUCKS.  I also hate Camille.  She'll be voted off next week.  Trust me.  But WHY does Tyra have a single coming out?  WHY?  That's a no good idea if I ever heard one.  Meeting time.  Whee!

       Let's start with the good.   My favorite pirate has a  urlLink blog .  Great story about said pirate: Once, while walking along the banks of the Mississippi about this time of year - Winter Musical time, probably  Annie Get Your Gun  - she stepped on a corn cob and yelled, "OHMYGOD it's a BIIIIRRRRD!"   The not so good.   Justin and I had a rough weekend.  I will never ever ever look at eight apartments in two days ever again.  EVER.  I will especially never spend all of Valentine's Day driving around Kansas City, including the lovely Troost area and other parts of Missouri I will never be able to find again.  But he found an apartment at 4:00 yesterday afternoon, a really nice one for not a lot of money, and it's close to my apartment (which was actually quite surprising).  I must add that it was also not on our list to visit - we just drove past and decided to go in.  I also had to watch  Swimming Pool , which was the most confusing movie ever, even if I didn't sleep through half of it.  What the hell happened?  If you can tell me why the girl at the end was different than the girl during the rest of the movie, I will give you $5.00.   But Friday was great.   We went to a terrible dinner at the Elephant Bar - don't ever go there - came home and played with Roo, who is enamored with Justin (who isn't?) and then went to Boozefish with the girls.  Connie was such a doll and brought us flowers and Sara's cat, Bill Murray, tried to eat them.   A yarn tragedy  occurred Saturday morning.  I saw  urlLink this  yarn online at work and I thought I might like to have it, mostly because it was super chunky and I love anything chunky and also because it was on sale for $3.99 when it's usually $15.95.  That's a 75% discount, people.  I could make a really inexpensive sweater out of that.  I thought I remembered how I linked to the page.  Two hours on the computer later, I still couldn't find it.  I gave up.  So I come into work today, hoping there's still some left (I bookmarked the page, of course) and there's not.  The yarn of the week is pretty cool, but I would probably need a lot more than I should spend.  KNITPICKS, Kristin, KNITPICKS.  If you ever forget the name of the site again, I will kill you.  I am still very angry.   I miss  Abby, Kate, Maria, Clark, Dave, Big Mar and Chuck B. and most of all, my Peep.  I will hopefully get to see her this weekend.  I could use some good sleep in The Nest with my Peep.

      I got paid today!  Not only did I get paid, but I got paid for freelancing time AND salary, since freelancing comes after the time you actually work and salary comes during the time you actually work and it's very exciting.  Boyfriend is coming today.  Yay, Boyfriend!  And he'll be back in like, a week or so!  And I'm going to have hot chocolate soon!  Other good things: I had sushi for dinner last night.  I've never had sushi before.  It was good and I met some really nice/funny people at dinner.  I feel very metropolitan.  Roo doesn't seem so scared of me anymore.  Still scared, but not petrified.  I talked to Abby last night.  Contrary to popular belief, she's not dead behind the Panera counter.  I'm wearing pink.  I took a bath last night.  I bought two issues of Interweave Knits (WHY does Borders still have the fall issue on display when the Spring issue is currently out?  Why?  It's okay because I was able to buy three issues all in one week and it's published only four times a year.  But still.) and some purple Persian wool at the bargain price of $6.50.  I couldn't help myself.  I was able to resist the Noro in color 95, but only because I was wearing a sweater made out of Noro 56.  But I truly love Noro.  I truly love Trendsetter's Gypsy, too.  I truly, truly love The Studio.  Chrissy did not die in a snowstorm and made it to Fargo.  Thanks for worrying me, Mom.  My mother was given doctor's orders to drink some really good alcohol.  Not so good things: My mom's hearing in her right ear is probably permanently gone.  I was able to take a good look at little Roo's back and he has horrible, deep tooth marks and scabs from the Killer Mouse.  It looks really painful.  I need to buy supplies for Valentine's storytime tomorrow.  Can three year-olds handle glue sticks or should I just go with red paper and marker?

       TRU LUVs   I love a lot of things.  Let's name them.  We already had the boys I loved (which did not count the boys I named my "boyfriends."  I had this habit - and still do - of going up to people and saying, "You're my boyfriend now."  I once had the entire freshman trumpet section as my boyfriend and I'm currently dating Paul the Borders Barrista.  He's not quite sure what to make of this.) so now it's everthing else.  Village Inn Parentheses Golden Retrievers Yarn *NSYNC The 80s Jem (including all of her posse - Kimber, Shana, Jerica - who is actually Jem - Synergy, Roxy, Stormer, Rio and the Australian girl) Rainbow Brite Sprites America's Next Top Model Whole pickles Toasted Ravioli Target shoes Holiday themed socks Dog socks Dog shows (DOG SHOW!)  If You Give a Mouse a Cookie  Creme brulee Starbuck's Vanilla Creme (I had it for the first time last night - it's like drinking a vanilla shake) Parents Peepto Pirates Chapstick Baths Big beds Boys in love  Kara Moran: JC Chasez is in town tonight at IncrediBowl.  Want me to go and tell him to lose the mullet?

       This one goes out to the one I love.   It looks like Boyfriend is a permanent situation.  (And by "permanent situation" I do not mean we are getting married.  Oh no.  I mean he might be taking a job near me.  That's all.  No weddings.  No babies.)  Scary?  Kind of.  Awesome?  Definitely.  Moving on with my life and being a real person with a real live boyfriend nearby?  Scaaa-ary.  So let's remember all of those other boys I once loved.  A pre-Valentine's Day tribute, if you will.  (And if they Google themselves, at least they'll find  something .)  7th grade - 12th grade: Josh McCaughey.  I loved him.  Luuurved him, if you're Bridget Jones.  He taught me how to do algebra equations with two variables and I found that...endearing?  Sexy?  He had beautiful brown eyes and blond hair and I loved him.  I also burned a picture of him my sophomore year at the International Thespian Festival.  Please note I stole that picture from the yearbook office and I didn't actually speak to him between 8th grade and 12th grade.  8th grade - 9th grade: Rian Waterman.  He had the SAILabration at his house and I was crying because I was sad middle school was over (DEAR GOD what was wrong with me?) and he HELD MY HAND.  It was all over school the next day because he had a girlfriend (who was, admittedly, pretty awesome).  Freshman year he sat behind me in honors biology and was dating a different girl, but we'd talk on the phone at night.  He wore flannel shirts and listened to that song about runaway trains (Justin Marciniak, if you use precious commenting space to tell me the name and song of that band, I will hurt you).  He told me that he'd date me when he was done dating her.  I told him no.  9th grade: Disney Dave.  A senior.  Only wore clothing sporting Disney characters.  His father is still stalking me to this day.  We were kind of "together" even though we never kissed.  But wait - that's because he was kissing his (ex)girlfriend!  I hated his Tigger shirt.  Then he dated Barbara.  10th grade: Ross Rafferty (who I hear is pretty sick and I hope he gets better soon - he's a really good guy).  Ross was a senior trumpet player, I was a drum major.  His flute-playing freshman sister hooked us up for Homecoming.  I was a jackass and got scared and didn't go on another date with him after that even though I really liked him.  Then he dated Barbara, the same Barbara Disney Dave dated.  I don't care if she's French - I don't like her.  10th  grade: Nick Tofannelli and Chris Bollig, together and separately.  I can't remember which I liked first - Chris, I think.  I remember liking Nick during the spring play.  We spent every evening together and they ate a lot of barbecued beef and Crispitos.  We almost went to a cock fight in southern Illinois, but my mom wouldn't let me cross state lines with them.  Nick and I eventually went to my senior prom together.    11th grade: Paul, my First Real Boyfriend.  I met him at the Thespian Festival the previous summer.  I should have known something was wrong since he was wearing a mask when we first met.  He liked me so much it was scary.  And he cried a lot.  But he lived in his parents' basement, which had it's own entrance, living room, kitchen and recording studio.  He sang "Roxanne" a whole lot.   I cheated on him the next year at the Thespian Festival with a freshman from California named Jason who wore suspenders (we kissed underneath a tree - it was a horrible kiss, and trust me, I've had quite a few of those).  We got home and he told me it was okay because when we're at home, he knows I'm still his.  Right.    All through high school: Mike Flynn.  But we also hated each other, so we decided to be very good friends.  I think.  Let's just not talk about it.  But he was one of the funniest people I've ever known and I miss him a lot.  It should be noted that there's a man named Barney living in his well (seriously, there's a well at his parents' house).  Abby and I used to feed him.  12th grade: Justin Anderson.  Purely because he was on the swim team and looked really good in a speedo.  Really good.  I spent first semester trying to get a good view of him during statistics and taking pictures of him at swim meets for the newspaper, which never actually made it in to the newspaper because he was just too hot standing in no clothes on that little diving board and I got distracted.  12th grade: Brian Scott.  Second Boyfriend. He had amazing arms.  That's the first thing I think of.  He played paintball and had freckles and wore Gay Blue Shoes.  He always smelled really good and wore tie-dyed t-shirts and a backwards visor.  Now that I think of it, I can't figure out why he was attracted to me.  I don't think my parents liked him much.  He once carved a penis out of foam.  It was a summer thing.  We broke up a few months after I started college.  I hear he's playing for a professional paintball team.    Freshman year of college: Pauly-Paul.  But who didn't love Paul?  I stopped loving him when he told me I was "desperate" and "a dumbass," which, coincidentally, was the first time I'd heard the word dumbass used in about three years.  Now I use it every day.  But you have to admit, he's very snuggly.  Freshman year of college: Adam Evans.  Probably the most embarrassing time of my life.  Adam, I'm still really sorry for being such a dumbass.    Freshman year of college: David Alexander.  AGAIN, who didn't love him?  Who doesn't still love him?  I don't know a single person who wouldn't marry Dave Alexander.  Reasons to love Dave: he once wore all the clothes in the lost and found, he can jump higher than a golden retriever and he gives really good hugs.  Freshman year of college - present: Justin Marciniak.  Third and Last and Only Boyfriend.  I decided I liked him because he wore orange shoes and our names sounded good together (Kristin Marciniak sounds much better than Kristin Nagel/Kristin Jennings/Kristin Healy, etc.).  He was also, like, the hottest guy who had ever talked to me and I got nervous every time I talked to him.  Luckily, he lived with a furry little man who always served as conversation fodder.  Everyone told me he was bad news and that he would only break my heart.  He did, many times.  I'm sure he will in the future.  But he's my butthead of a valentine and my non-pirate best friend.  And I luuuurve him.

       urlLink Josh won!   Yaaaay Josh!  I love him.  He weights 155 lbs.  That's twice the weight of Penny (whose birthday is tomorrow - yaaaaay Penny!).  I totally knew he would win.  I am also forecasting that Mercedes will win ANTM because she's so damn cute.  I think it'll be down to her, Sara and Shandi.  And Yoanna.  If Camille doesn't get kicked off next week, I'm going to call Janice Dickenson.

      Dear Friends, I hope that if you have, or will someday have, a significant other, they will not torture you as much as  urlLink mine  does.  I want to kick him and kiss him, beat him senseless and hug him into oblivion all at the same time.  Boyfriend, you better look out.  A crisis was averted.  I'm supposed to go to a Mary Kay pampering night (which I've done before and love), but I was afraid I was going to miss ANTM, and Shandi supposedly, according to commercials and Janice Dickenson's too-tight face, admits to using drugs.  (I bet she's probably joking or said she used to do drugs or is on allergy medication, but whatever.)  AND I was going to miss the end of the Westminster Dog Show (DOG SHOW!).  I'm rooting for Josh, the Newfoundland.  I didn't know what time the skin care extraveganza was starting or where it was, so I called my Mary Kay contact and it turns out it's been moved to 6:00!  Meaning plenty of time for TV, but also meaning that I will probably not go to the gym today.  I'm seriously going to workout hell.  I have lost the drive.  But I SWEAR I will go Thursday.  Maybe I'll walk/do yoga tomorrow?  But the bed is just too wonderful to ignore.  Now I must meet with a guy from Yahoo!.  Not a yahoo, but from Yahoo!.

      Weekends are always too short.  The Holovaty's were great hosts Friday night, serving us yummy turkey and a new favorite game, Pit.  I said goodbye to  urlLink Arthur  on Saturday night as he heads for LA pastures and watched the Grammys with Kella last night.  My favorite part of the whole weekend was the 15+ hours of sleep between 11 p.m. Saturday and 3:30 p.m. Sunday, complete with a lunch of eggs and honey biscuits.    The mouse (who I generally refer to as "Mousie" instead of any real name) and I are trying to get along.  He's very scared of me.  I think he's about six weeks old, and mice aren't adults until they're 12 weeks old, so we have  ways to go.  I did, however, discover that he really likes Cheerios (or, in this case, honey nut Toastie O's - don't tell him his mom buys generic), which could be a bonding point between the two of us.  I watched him play for about an hour last night and it was just so...nice.  Other than that, my weekend was pretty quiet.  I bought Mary-Kate and Ashley makeup at Wal-Mart (half the price of Revlon) and cleaned the house.  If weekends were a day longer, I'd be a lot happier.

      I'm hoping I get some work to do this millenium.  Everyone is antsy today.  People are biting each other in the office next to me.  Others are planning weddings (three bands!  Three!) and watching soap operas.  Fridays - why even bother?  Me and the little mouse played last night.  We're getting to be buddies, although he still enjoys peeing on me.  He's just a baby, I think, so I'm not too worried.  He's so soft.  I got him some bedding which looks like cotton candy and he made a very cozy little bed.  He sleeps in the middle of it and must close up all the entrance holes to it before he settles in for a nap.  I can just see the cotton going up and down, up and down with the breath of a little mouse.  I love that little guy.  I kind of miss Ralph, though.  He was so cute and managed to keep me entertained for three days straight.  He was a wily little mouse.  Maybe I'll go by the store this weekend to say hello.  I will not repurchase him, however, because he's a killer.  Penny is very glad that my mom's home.  I miss my Peep.  I could have used her 70-lb body on my lap last night while I froze during television time.  I started my knee socks.  I'm doing a knee sock knit-along, and I would put the cute button here, but a) I can't figure out how and b) that would be a lot of work.  They're from the Stitch and Bitch book.  I'm using lime green, hot pink, turquoise and a bright sherbet orange.  They're made out of baby wool, so they're not really super hot, but they'll be very soft.  AND machine-washable.  I'm trying to find a large quantity of inexpensive yet soft yarn to make a two-person sized blanket for my big couch.  I only have one-person sized blankets in the living room, and I'm not taking the Gay Pride Blanket off my bed.  I don't think I would be able to sleep without it at least near me, if not on me.  I found some good stuff on a discount site and it would be about $20 for 10 skeins (an incredible deal), but they require at least a $30 order.  Maybe I can find something else I like, but the site just sells those Hobby Lobby yarns, not the good stuff I've gotten used to.  And there's really nothing else I'm dying to make, since I have these socks, a pair of Regia socks, some cotton yarn to experiment with and the gorgeous Candy sweater to work on.  So I don't know.    Tragedy struck one of my Sim famlies last night.  Lizzie Dorfmann, daughter of Alex and Jemina, sister of the newly-born Josie, came down with some horrible coughing disease and died.  The grim reaper came and Jemina made a plea for her daughter's life, but the Reaper was like, F-that.  So she died and there's a gravestone outside and the whole family cries, like, all the time.  So I sold the gravestone.  Enough crying.  And their new daughter, Josie, looks like neither one of the parents and is kind of butt-ugly.  And the mail person is a girl!  And they don't have a milkman!

      Nobody is at work/working because of all the snow.  It's a slow day.  My mom is finally home from the hospital.  Not because she is better or "cured," but because she told them she was leaving and they were like, "All right."  I do not take an responsibility for her actions.  But she said she was really bored there.  Here's what I have to say about the whole Super Bowl debacle.  Get the hell over it.  Everybody has breasts.  Janet's are particularly nicer than others.  But seriously, they show butts on NYPD Blue and all sorts of body parts on Today.  If you're that offended by bodies, then maybe you should not have one.  I don't think either of them intended to show the actual breast (don't give me that crap about the piercing - I bet if you checked the other one, she'd have on there, too).  But they did.  Now what are you going to do about it?  Take it away.  And another note about Janet Jackson - she's not as wholesome as people seem to think.  She has simulated S&M-themed sex onstage with fans during her concerts- trust me, I saw it.  Her last album was full of a lot of moaning and orgasmic noises.  Actually, her last THREE albums were.  The last album resembling anything wholesome was Rhythm Nation, and that was all, "I hate you, divided, racist America."  You didn't expect for something like this to happen?  I mean, really.    But I watched Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, which was much more entertaining.  I always feel bad for Ted when the guys screw up the food, especially the guy trying to make a mint julep for his equally-idiotic/annoying girlfriend.  I think they should have stuck with the frozen White Castle hamburgers from the marine's freezer.

      Good day at work.  Great day, even.  We went to California Pizza Kitchen to celebrate Nancy's and my first day.  A good time was had by all.  Good food, too.  I had a grilled garlic shrimp pizza.  Yuuummm.  A lot has being going on the past few days.  Chronological order:  Monday:  Bought two mice, Ralph and Roo/Peanut Ralph tried to kill Roo several times.  Roo's back and ear were all cut up and bleeding. Ralph got a timeout. Ralph tried to kill Roo again.   Ralph got moved to a shoe box so I could return him to the next day on the basis that he is a killer.   Tuesday:  I find out at 6:30 a.m. that my mom is in the hospital.  She's dizzy and has an earache. I learn about my health plan and other benefits at work. I come home to discover Ralph has escaped the shoebox.  He chewed a hole in the top. Ralph is going to hell. I find him 10 minutes after I start looking for him.  He's hiding next to my Nintendo games and yarn.  That's where I'd hide, too. Unfortunately, Ralph can jump higher than a kangaroo.  I lose him. Chrissy comes over to help me. We get takeout and give up looking to watch ANTM.   We collectively hate Catie, yet she doesn't get voted off. I set some traps (humane ones, okay?) for Ralph. I get into bed at 10:15.   The smoke alarm decides it needs new batteries. I get into the car and go to the gas station a few blocks away. Back in bed by 10:30, but really tired and pissed off.   Wednesday  Woke up at 4:45 a.m. to go to the bathroom or something. Decide to check mouse traps. No Ralph. Look under couches and behind stuff.  Open pantry. There's Ralph!  He's on the bottom shelf, having a snack. We talk for a bit.  I tell him he has to come out.  He doesn't like that idea. I end up taking everything, including the shelving unit, out of the pantry.   Ralph is behind the water heater (it's more of a large closet than pantry, but I adapted it). I catch him with a towel at 5:40. He gets put into Roxy's old tank with some bedding and food.  I tape down the lid, then put the tank into a garbage can, and then cover the garbage can with a wire cooling rack.  I'm not taking any chances. At 9 a.m. sharp, Ralph is back at PetSmart.  They put him in "isolation."  I felt kind of bad, then remembered he was a killer.  Every week I think, "This week has got to be better than the last.  Nothing can be as bad as last week."  And then I am systematically proved wrong day after day.  But I have a feeling that things are looking up.  I'll sleep a little better tonight knowing that it won't be too long until I won't have to sleep alone anymore (even if it's just for two days next week).

      Dear God, I know we don't talk much, usually just inside my head or when I'm in the car.  I don't go to church, I'm not so sure about the Bible, and I still don't believe in dinosaurs.  But God, I believe in you.  So let my mom be okay, okay?  Thanks.

      It's been a slow day.  I keep replaying that kiss with Justin Timberlake over and over and over in my head.  We danced first.  Danced like we never danced before.  And I remember being really close to his lips and staring at them.  In my dream, they were a lot nicer than they are in real life (trust me on this one - I've spent a lot of "up close and personal" minutes with several posters/publications), so I think they actually belonged to my real Justin (who does, in fact, have better lips than anyone I know, except for myself.  My mom's Mary Kay lady even told me I have perfect lips.  They are quite stunning.).  The yarn diet is over.  Since I don't believe in diets in general, I figured that a yarn diet was a stupid idea.  And I finally got paid today.  And  urlLink Knitability  had sock yarn for $5, so I ordered the last two skeins.  I'm going to make  urlLink arm warmers .

      This has been one crazy-ass weekend.  Friday: Came home from work.  Sims.  Strange dinner involving a "hamburger salad."  Passed out at 7:30.  Saturday: Woke up at 5:30.  Went through old letters and attempted to clean.  Gym, storytime, pet store (almost bought a mouse named Ralph, as in Ralph S. Mouse), got in a fight with a lady at JoAnn's, big nap.    Here's where it gets interesting.  Elizabeth, Connie and I went to XO to go dancing.  If you're not from the area, XO is this huge techno dance club that's a little on the sketchy side.  Sara was supposed to come, but was sick.  We had a drink for her.  ANYWAY, nobody was at XO.  We got there at 10 - at 11:30, still no one.  Seriously.  Like five people.  So we went to the Lava Room for a few drinks.  It's a really cool bar - lava lamps and candles everywhere.  That's when we meet David, Scott and Steve, whose average age was about 44.  David's an assistant principal, Scott likes Nascar and was really really drunk, and they were celebrating Steve's birthday.  Steve was the drunkest person I have ever seen.  We talked with them for a couple of hours.  We were invited to Nascar many times and I was repeatedly told to break up with Justin.  We were then invited to "Steve's mansion just two blocks away" to play pool.    Right.  We finally had enough and decided to go around 1:30.  They asked us to hug Steve because it was his birthday.  We did.  Then they wanted to take our picture with him.  This is when Steve, who had spoken no more than 10 words to any of us the entire night, requested a group kiss.  We all screamed "NO!" and jumped up to leave.    And that's when Nascar-lovin' Scott tried to kiss me.  He was "helping" me with my coat, and I'm facing the bartender, mouthing, "Help me," to no avail.  He then tried to turn me around and said "Hey, your boyfriend is in Chicago," and made his move.  I ducked and screamed, "I'm not kissing  ANYONE!" and we ran out of the bar.  I think it was one of the most fun nights I've had in awhile.  I laughed so much.  David was really interesting and told great stories about the kids at his school.  He was a good guy.  And they told us that we were fun and funny and we agreed that we're pretty great.  But the next time someone says they want to meet older men, let's not go  that  old.  Or that drunk.  I could go for one or the other, but not both together.  But it really was a great night.  So I came home, showered the nasty off of myself and had some tater-tots and was in bed at 3 a.m.  Sunday: Woke up at 9:00.  Peanuts and chocolate for breakfast.  Went to the gym.  Sims.  Huge, hurting nap.  Laundry, cleaning, finished my felted bag which matches my sweater.  It turned out really well - it's currently drying over a box to make the bottom flat so it can stand up on its own.  I made a pretty good dinner - chicken cooked with green peppers, mushrooms and garlic, mixed with spiniach fettucini.  Not too shabby.  I'm going to have the leftover chicken in a fajita-like thing tomorrow night.    Oh, and I've watched approximately six hours of Queer Eye today.  I love that Carson.  That's the only television show that makes me laugh out loud.  I especially love it when Carson asks about couture.  And when he told the crew member, "Hugs, not drugs."

      It is very strange not having any control over how you feel.  None at all.  I've been exhausted lately - not worn out, but falling asleep while driving.  It doesn't matter how much sleep I get (usually 8 1/2 or 9 hours).  I'm tired all the time.  Especially when the heater is on.  So then I'm just cold and tired.  I counted my baby prozacs this morning and I have 16 left.  16!  That's a whole lot!  That's 16 more days of waiting to try something new, 16 more days of crazy-ass mood swings.  I could have sworn I've been taking these things for longer than two weeks.  But I guess not.  Then I switch to something new and it's all baby-fied and I'll have to wait another two weeks to get on a regular dosage and wait a few months to see if it works and if it doesn't go through all of this again.    Work might just be plentiful this afternoon.  I hope so.  I hate having nothing to do and I'm getting really used to it.  When someone actually asks me to work, I get all indignant.  Not a good sign for my future.  I hope my swift and ball winder come this weekend.  I'm going to wind everything in the house that's not already in ball-form.  Including the furniture.

      On this day in 1974...  The Three Muskateers  was the #1 movie The Mariner 10 flew past Mercury The St. Louis Cardinals purchased Ed Crosby from the Philadelphia Phillies Duke Ellington passed away and Marilyn Jordan and Chuck Buel got married.  He wore a brown tuxedo and showed up to the ceremony still drunk from the night before and she got drunk at the reception.  I don't think things have changed that much.  Ladybird and Chives are celebrating their anniversary in San Francisco.  They called me last night during ESPN's Dream Job, blathering on about eating dinner outside at a little Italian bistro overlooking the Golden Gate bridge during sunset.  Tea in the Japanese tea gardens.  Blah blah blah why didn't you take me with you?  Does the product of your loins not deserve some recognition as well?  I mean, really, is there any other reason for living besides me?  Well, I would have settled for a week with the dog.  They better bring me some good presents.

       Don't Piss Me Off  or  How I Got in a Brawl on the Yarn Crawl  Well, it was more of a one-sided brawl.  We went to Tracy Bunker's, she's amazing, her hand-dyed yarns are incredible and I very nearly bought some raw silk just to pet and love.  Then we went to the Yarn Barn.  I hate the Yarn Barn.  I'd been there three times before, and each time I felt very unwelcome.  This time, the salespeople went out of their way to be horrible to me, I think.  I went in there intending to buy yarn for two sweaters.  That's a lot of yarn and a lot of money.  I was also considering buying the Absolutely Fabulous Throw from Colinette, which was $147.  And I thought about buying a drop-spindle so I could learn how to spin my own yarn.  I didn't buy a thing.  First of all, they had nothing in stock.  They only had four balls of the Rowan Kid Mohair in any given color, and I needed at least 10 to make the sweater.  Fine.  They wouldn't help me find anything else that was suitable.  So I decide to find yarn for the sweater I'd like to make myself.  Again, not enough yarn in stock.  People, if you're encouraging the making of actual sweaters, I suggest having enough yarn in one dyelot to do so.  We parked at Knit Wit in Olathe and carpooled to Lawrence.  When we got back to Knit Wit, I was so pissed off that I decided I would go inside and shop and purchase my items (even though there was no discount) just because the Yarn Barn didn't deserve my money.  The clerks there were so very helpful and directed me to Cascade 220, which is so wonderfully soft and even more wonderfully inexpensive.  The yarn for my mom's sweater was almost half of what I expected to pay, and since they were so nice and I was so mad at the Yarn Barn, I bought an entire bag of Cascade in a gorgeous red for myself.  That's $130 the Yarn Barn missed out on.  Suck it, Yarn Barn!  I also bought myself a ball winder and swift last night for a combined total of $75 - an amazing deal.  The Cascade comes in hanks, not skeins, and I decided it was just time to do it.  It'll be a good investment.  I finished the knee socks Saturday night and I'm planning on wearing them Wednesday.  They're awfully cute.  The green tank is back in action again, and it didn't take me too long to figure out where I left off back in August.  I swatched my mom's sweater, but I still need to block it.  It's going to take a long time - it has tons of cables and is ribbed all the way through.  The swatch was fun to make, so the sweater should be even better.  I'm just going to have to really concentrate when I do it.  We have a dinner with our Yahoo! reps tonight - mmmm, Lidia's.  I love that place.

      Oh man, do I love my secret pal.  I came home yesterday, hoping a surprise would await me in my mailbox, and it sure did!  It got The Knitter's Companion spiral-bound book, which has some great tips (especially since I only cast-on one way) despite the spaghetti sauce I immediately splattered on the edge.  AND I got some magenta sock yarn.  Not any magenta sock yarn, but Nature's Pride, which I actually can't find around here and wanted to use on my knee socks from  Stitch and Bitch .  Speaking of said knee socks, they're almost done.  I should be able to finish them during lunch today - one last stripe before the toe decreases.  I'm hoping to wear them on the Yarn Crawl tomorrow (even though it's going to be, like, 70 degrees.  Maybe a cold front will hit Lawrence right when we get there.).  I know I said I wasn't going to buy any yarn tomorrow, but I'm also a liar.  I'm planning on making a sweater for my mom when I finish all of these other projects, so I'm going to see if I can find anything at the Yarn Barn.  I mean, come on, 20% of is a great deal that shouldn't be passed up.  Also, if they have any sale Rowan Bulky or Super Bulky, I'm all over it.  I'm going to bring along the green tank top of last summer to work on - I'm about halfway through the back and it shouldn't take long to finish it up.  Maybe by next weekend?  And then it's on to the microsuede sweater in powder blue with the awesome cable, and then some Regia socks and then arm warmers and then that stupid mohair sweater that I ripped out about six times...  I'm looking forward to a weekend spent watching movies and knitting.  Yay for boyfriends who take a long time to get ready - I can get a lot of work done just waiting for him to tie his shoes.

      Sometimes you have those days, those days that are just so utterly horrible that you sit with your head in your hands at your desk and wonder, "How did two more hours get to be so long?" and you hate everything, especially yourself.  And then you drag yourself to the gym, change into your smelly clothes and consider just going home and laying on the couch instead of sweating.  But you get on that stupid bike and watch the last half of  Roseanne  and an Oprah show about cults and you think, "Well, at least I'm not in a cult."  And you go home and have some tortellini and squash and zuchinni with feta and GOD do you feel good.  So you do some sewing and make something totally rockin', manage to get the clothes off the floor (as well as the clean sheets that have been there since Sunday) and everything is suddenly bright and new.  It's too bad you can never tell when those days will happen.  Roo and Roxy took a field trip to Justin's last night because the exterminator will be visiting my apartment today.  I mean, nothing would probably happen to them, but I worry.  Because exterminators have stuff that kills mice, and Roo is a mouse, not the Incredible Pooping Machine that he thinks he is.  I cleaned their homes last night and we all slept at Justin's.  Roo noticed this morning that he wasn't at home and got kind of freaked out.  He was fine last night.  I think Roxy is just happy to have clean water.

      Even MORE people I know, people I graduated with, are getting married.  For the love of God, people!  No more marrying!  But I also saw that my former DARE officer got married.  He's a really nice guy.  When I was in 5th grade and had chickenpox, I missed the DARE graduation (AND Track and Field Day) and Officer Kimball came over to my house and gave me my certificate.  That was the nicest thing in the world.  Stupid things that have happened in the past a lot of hours: * I almost Euro-chopped Justin instead of an onion.  Those things can really shoot across the room. * I dropped an egg on the counter * Soap bubbles came out of the lettuce we washed on Saturday night * I made the shittiest mashed potatoes EVER * I somehow got a hole in the butt of the only jeans I ever wear * I think I left my lunch at home this morning * I am incapable of making a french knot * I tore a (small) hole in the back of my turtleneck as I ripped off the tag in the car  Good things: * My new Overstock.com sheets are freaking amazing.  230 thread count, satin-y, and only $25.  I fully endorse Overstock.com * I finished and felted two cute little bags yesterday

      So of course all of this wedding talk has gotten me thinking about  my  non-existent wedding.  In case you haven't heard the plans:  * It will be an evening wedding so everybody can dress up * The reception will be right after with a lot of dancing and a cake on each table.  Nobody wants to eat that stupid chicken and beef stuff anyway.  I know Justin won't. * Justin doesn't like cake, so I don't really give a crap if he comes at all * If he does, I said he could order some pizza * There will be dogs.  Lots of dogs. * The centerpieces will be made of yarn and cassette tapes * My parent's friends will be locked up in a building at least 500 yards away from the actual ceremony and reception, except Reverend Pat, who will be marrying us * Stevie Wonder will be the musical artist/DJ  This is all assuming I marry Justin.  But I've always assumed that.  That's why I decided to like him in the first place.  But I've been reading this message board and everyone's all up in arms about veil lengths and photographers and honeymoons.  I say what really matters is the music played during the reception.  My list of "must-haves": * "Do You Realize" by the Flaming Lips * "I'm the Man who Loves You" by Wilco * "Made to Love Her" by Stevie Wonder * "They all Laughed" as sung by Ella and Louis and, of course, * "Whoomp!  There it is" by Tag Team  I'm also open to anything with the words, "Na na na na," in it.

Because if you get married, how can we live on a farm with a lot of dogs and baby chickens?  Drew's nice and all, but I am far more 80s than him AND I can name all the Cosby kids.  I publicly vow, right here and now, that I would give up Justin for you any day.  Unless you refuse to be Leroy to my Shirley.  Then we're over.

       If my head explodes, I designate YOU to pick up the pieces  I.  Am.  Freaking.  Out.  So I'm taking a small break from looking up competitor's ads (a lot of fun, actually) and look at my blog stats.  I noticed people have been searching for a name of someone on here a few weeks back.  Then I Google him and end up on some crazy QC Weddings message board and Holy Mother of God, they're all getting married.  (For Abby: The Hobeast is married, but I think you knew that)  Most of them are actually in Abby's class, but a lot of them talked about guys they dated in my class (for whom, of course, I had deep, unrequited love).  And my ex-boyfriend Brian is ENGAGED.  ENGAGED.  Meaning he has to have a job other than paintball (right?  right?  You can't live off paintball, right?).  And I saw pictures of Abbie and Conrad and they're freaking GETTING MARRIED and Mitch - MITCH - is engaged and he was my first kiss.  MITCH.  Let's all (me and Abby and my mom) consider how truly scary that is.  Petty Theft.  Mitchy-Mitch.  Nothing good can come of that.  And to top it off, I got a card last night from a friend I probably haven't talked to since middle school AND SHE HAS A BABY.    Now let's look at my life.  I OWN A MOUSE.  And he has an offensive personal odor (which is not his fault - he's just a mouse) and thinks I'm a toilet.  Holy crap.

      There has been a Big Change in the "no yarn clause."  Not that there won't be any yarn.  I was planning on buying the Colinette Absolutely Fabulous Throw kit at the Yarn Barn, but it's rather pricey and my discount won't do much.  So I'm going to LOOK at it at the Yarn Barn next weekend and then I'm going to BUY IT from a place in England.  Yay, England.  I'm thinking the  urlLink Versace  colorway - thoughts?  I have a doctor in Kansas City.  Good job, me.  She's really nice.  So nice, in fact, I'm going back to see her in April AND in May.  Wahoo!  She also gave me a lot of free drugs.  Yay, drugs.  The downside to this is that while it's quite easy/amusing to say, "I have some extra Prozac," it is not easy nor amusing to say, "I have some extra Wellbutrin."  So I'm keeping all of my drugs to myself.  My music collection needs an overhaul.  I just don't want to listen to any of the CDs I have.  So I'm taking Justin's.

      Friday was indeed a not-so-good-day.  That is until I got home and checked my mail - thank you so much, Secret Knitting Buddy!  I love anything with a K on it and I especially love hot pink.  My day did an immediate 180 once I opened the mailbox.  I had a wonderful weekend.  The worst part is that it's over.  Friday night Justin and I had dinner (I can't remember what - can you?  Oh yeah, really good homemade pizza.) and visited with the Muellers and family at Starbucks.  Saturday was the celebration of Connie's birthday, so we went to Mimi's Cafe, got super-trendy haircuts at the Spy Agency, ate fried pickles at Tomfooleries and engaged in other debauchery.  Then Justin and I went out for pizza  (we like pizza), went to my place to finish  Y Tu Mama Tambien , then spent the night at his house.  Yesterday, we finally got moving around 1:30 and went to the grocery store.  I came home and took a nap, then went back to his place for a walk and fajitas.  Then I went to bed at 9:30.  Tonight is Guild - I missed last month, so I'm looking forward to tonight.  I'm wearing Rosedale United today to remind me to go to the meeting.  It's not 5:00 yet.  I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.  I could totally go for some chocolate.

      I pulled this up a long time ago, before I went to meet with some reps, and now I can't remember what I was going to say.  Oh!  Yes!  I did indeed go to The Studio and I did indeed buy some yarn.  Almost all for gifts and one skein for me to practice said gifts.  My next purchases will be the Denise Interchangeable needles ($45 for what would cost you, if you bought them separately, $1000) and a Colinette throw kit.  I'm going to buy the kit on the Yarn Crawl in a few weeks because I'll get a big discount and that baby will be expensive.  And then I will not WILL NOT buy yarn until...let's say June.  I'll make that my goal.  Unless it's that skein of Lamb's Pride Lotus Pink, because I'm trying to make a felted hat and I ran out.  So then no more yarn until June.  Promise.  Hold me to it.

       urlLink This freaks me out.   We saw a presentation from the production company that does this stuff.  Please notice that even when they're not talking, the people are blinking.  That's the creepy part.  Also, they're not videos - they take one picture of a person, integrate it into their software and then it lip synchs to the audio on its own.  Neat, but creepy as hell.  Sara likened it to Max Headroom.  I concur.  I'm going to The Studio during lunch.  I haven't left the office during lunch yet this week, and it will be my reward for when I finish this client report.  I had a really good workout last night - I did the eliptical trainer for 35 minutes and I wasn't out of breath or tired at all and I even sprinted for the last five minutes.  I know.  I'm out of control.  But I think I'm starting to get in shape, which definitely makes exercising more palatable.

       The long awaited story about Alfonzo  I'm spending the night at Justin's, sinning as usual.  At 3 a.m., I wake up to go to the bathroom.  I come back and Justin starts telling me all about his David Koresch dream and then we hear really loud banging.  I say, "That's the cops!" and Justin asks how I know.  Listen, I lived in FARC long enough to know when the cops were in the building.  Anyway, I ran to the door and looked out the peephole (Justin wasn't allowed to because he wasn't wearing his contacts and therefore worthless).  This is what I gathered: Alfonzo is 20.  He's not wearing a shirt, but is wearing some lovely blue sweatpants.  His hands are in his pants.  The cops think he has a gun, but his hands are just cold  He has a cut on his face and on his chest, as well as some sort of marking on his eye.  He and his girlfriend had a fight.  He didn't like the people she went out with earlier in the night.  They yelled at each other and hit each other.  The cops asked who was more aggressive and he said, "Look at me.  She fucked me up."  And the cops all laughed and Justin and I went back to bed.  I'm hungry.  I'm on my way to the gym.  I'm going to try to fix my computer tonight.  Let's all rally together and try to get OH WHAT IS HER FACE, not Shandi, not Yoanna, not Mercedes, but the other one voted off.  Because, really, she's too clinical.  (Drinking game of the night: take a drink everytime someone says 'clinical'.  Two drinks if it's the guy from  Jane .)

       FHP  I seriously reenacted one of those Tampax commercials.  You know the one - the woman goes in the bathroom and starts beating on the tampon dispenser, and another woman hands her a generic tampon.  The woman says thanks and proceeds to use the generic to get the Tampax out of the machine.  My problem was similar, but not.  I left my purse at home today.  I'm still not sure how that happened.  I swear to god I had it when I got in the car.  When I got out, it was gone.  I imagine it's next to my couch.  Anyway, without purse I don't have a) feminine hygiene product and b) money.  Someone finally gave me a quarter.  I go to the bathroom to use that handy little machine and the damn thing is jammed with quarters.  I managed to get one of the quarters out, gave the borrowed one back and went up to the 15th floor to use that machine.  So I scored $0.25 AND a trip to 15.  This is exciting stuff.  And if you're short on cash, there's another quarter in the machine that I couldn't get out.   My computer has committed suicide.   (My home PC, not the work PC.)  It's five years old and suddenly stopped opening any and all folders, as well as Microsoft programs in general.  Gateway support says the only thing to do is reformat my entire harddrive.  Are you mad?  I have a lot of valuable Sims data stored on there!  So instead I'm getting a new computer/slightly used monitor.  My computer still runs Windows 98 and has been missing pieces of Microsoft Office since my sophomore year (coincidentally, I lost the first disk during my freshman year).  So it's a new computer for me.  I would like to thank the Bs for the computer, whenever it arrives, and I promise to repay the favor when you are old and drooling all over each other.  I'll get you one of those nice oxygen tanks with wheels - maybe even a double wide.   That darn mouse  Roo loves me!  For real!  He jumps right into my hand when I get him from his cage and when I come home and say hello, he stands up on his little hind legs and looks out the bars of his cage to find me.  We've made a lot of progress.  I finally saw him go up his new tube - he was looking for Cheerios, so I put some more in.   Coming soon...  I have a great story involving the cops and a guy named Alfonzo who lives next door to Justin, but I'll have to save that for tomorrow.

       Beaten with the idiot stick  If I have for some reason given you my cell phone number is the past, oh, say, 2.5 months, odds are its wrong.  Mostly because the prefix to my cell number and my work number are one number apart and I decided to just combine them or something.  I don't know.  But let me know and I'll give you the real one.

      Last night was horrible.  On top of a lot of other things, I tried to watch  Blast , a Broadway drum & bugle corp show.  And I couldn't.  It's kind of weird on stage - I like it on a football field a lot more.  I wish: * my mouse wasn't a poop machine * I could sleep as much as I want * I had a hook to hang my new yarn holder from the ceiling * Queer Eye was on every night

       Roo's Big Night  My little mouse and I decided to let bygones be bygones and played together last night.  I worry that Roo is an unhappy little mouse, mostly because he thinks I'm a toilet and absolutely hates his bedding.  As soon as I put clean bedding in his cage, he stuffs it into every possibly nook and cranny.  I'm not really sure exactly what he likes besides Cheerios.    I put him in his ball for a few minutes while I washed my face, and he was pretty much done pooping by the time I came back.  I've learned that he needs time to let everything go after I first visit with him.  I took him out and we watched Queer Eye.  He was peeking over my fingers and eventually climbed off my arm.    That's when I discovered Roo's true love: yarn.  He couldn't get enough of my Homespun blanket.  It was piled in the corner of the couch and he climbed it and ran between the folds and bounced around like the was having the time of his life.  My beautiful crazy scarf was on top of the banket, and he immediately started exploring.   You must understand that Roo is afraid of everything.  His first few hours with me were rather traumatic and I'm afraid he's been scarred for life (his back is almost healed, though).  So it's amazing that he didn't even hesitate to play in the blanket and with the scarf.  I was a little nervous that he'd expunge something unpleasant, so I moved him to the coffee table.  He must not understand glass, because he would only walk on magazines and a plastic bag from  urlLink The Studio .  The bag is clear, so he "hid" from me for awhile behind it and gave himself a bath.  He was out of his cage for about a half hour total, and he didn't poop on a thing.  It was a very proud moment for me and my little mouse.  But when I put him back, I tried to clean his wheel and he was scared all over again.  We'll try again tonight.

      Last night on Queer Eye, Carson ate something very old from a refrigerator, much to Ted's horror.  It was my moment of the night.    And Camille got voted off!  Praise the Lord.  Next week, Shandi has sex with a really hot Italian guy and her squeaky boyfriend doesn't like that one bit.  Don't make the squeaky boyfriend mad, Shandi.  I'm going on a date tonight.

      So I went to the vending machine a few minutes ago.  I know, I know.  But I went for a walk during lunch and I'm going to the gym tonight and I was so freaking hungry yesterday afternoon on the way home and I was hungry again now.  Anyway.  I checked my options - cookies, cupcakes, candy bars, chips and (what I fell for yesterday, but not by choice) Certs.  For some reason, I decided I wanted Fritos.  I hate Fritos.  Hate them.  Can't stand them.  Horrible things.  But I thought they sounded good so I ate most of them and then threw them away (with chips still in the bag).    Please remember: You hate Fritos, Kristin.

      Today is a better day.  I attempted to start a purse out of yesterday's purchase, and it just wasn't right.  So I grabbed some honkin' big needles and started a scarf, which is absolutely wonderful.  It's gorgeous.  It's probably not going to be warm, but very fashionable.  If anyone wants to buy it, I'll sell it for $30 (the yarn itself was $33 - I'm willing to take a slight loss and not charge for my time) because somebody needs to wear this gorgeous thing.  I watched five episodes of  Sex and the City .  I had grilled turkey, zuchinni, squash and onions for dinner.  I put together my new bathroom towel rack.  All in all, it was a pretty great night.

      I went to the yarn store.  I bought yarn.  It's beautiful and crazy.  It has white cotton, pink sparkly acrylic or something and turqoise eyelash all mixed together.  I'm going to make a purse with bamboo handles and line it with pink fabric.  Anyone want to buy it?  I have a connection here to sell it in a store or somewhere, but I'd much rather it go to one of my friends.  I'm thinking it will be in the $50-$60 range.  I'll post a picture after it's finished.  It's going to be AMAZING.  I feel a change coming on.

      I'm stuck in a funk, a rut, a horrible nasty place to be.  I already ate my lunch, the printer I need to use is broken, so I can't work on my competitive reports yet, it's lunchtime so no one will be there to answer my calls and I can't look at this computer screen anymore.  So I'm going to the yarn store.  I haven't been knitting.  It's been more than two weeks.  I picked up a scrap scarf last night for about 20 minutes, but I just didn't feel it.  My mom said I'm transitioning to a new part of my life, and I agree.  Everything is constant with me now - boyfriend, job, friends, income.  I even quit Borders to streamline my weekends (how I'll miss that $6 a week).  The sky is always gray and I'm sick of television and doing the dishes.  I miss that bounce in my step and the extra bag of yarn in my hands every morning.  So I'm going to the yarn store.

      I think I need a haircut.  I spent much of the weekend in a horizontal position.  It was nice.  Yesterday, I turned off the TV, laid down on the couch and watched the rain through the sliding glass doors.  It was peaceful and beautiful until Justin banged on the door like he was dying.  He wasn't.  I like having him here.  It's an adjustment, though, one I knew I would have to make but didn't really want to.  Visiting for just a few days is different - it's romantic and rushed and sad and comfortable all at the same time.  I SWEAR TO GOD IF THEY DON'T STOP GRINDING METAL UPSTAIRS I'M GOING TO HURT SOMEONE.  Sorry.  They're remodeling the floor above me and will be doing so for another month.  Anyway.  It's different with him living here because now we have to bring our lives together and find some way to make them mesh again.  We haven't lived in the same city for 10 months.  That's a long freaking time.  I got used to being alone (not that I always liked it) and not having to share space.  And I'm DEFINITELY not sharing a bed every night.        You're  Watership Down !   by Richard Adams     Though many think of you as a bit young, even childish, you're actually incredibly deep and complex. You show people the need to rethink their assumptions, and confront them on everything from how they think to where they  build their houses. You might be one of the greatest people of all time. You'd be recognized as such if you weren't always talking about talking rabbits.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .      I've never read this book.  I probably never will.

       How to really piss me off   Write an article about Tap Day saying that QEBH and Mystical 7 are the only societies non-application based and have significantly fewer members than the rest of the societies.  DO YOU KNOW HOW TO COUNT?  Obviously, there were only six girls in purple robes up there, people.  Mystical 7 has...SEVEN.  And LSV is the only society that is secret for a whole freaking year, not just two weeks.  Two weeks!  I could keep anything a secret for two weeks!  Do you know how hard a whole year is?  Do you know how many people, especially my boyfriend, got freaked out by it?  And there's no application.  It'd be a lot easier to pick people if there was.  I hate the Maneater and I don't even go to school there anymore!  And they even used to employ me!  For people who are so uptight about writing "Francis Quadrangle" instead of "the quad," they sure don't do much fact checking.  But anyway, since I'm thinking about it, Easter candy really isn't as much fun without my LSV sisters.

      A lot of people are beginning their last few weeks in Columbia.  And they're sad.  There's no reason to be sad.  Once I left Columbia, it was like I never lived there in the first place.  I miss friends, sure, but not the place.  I think it was, for some reason, very easy for me to leave college and move on.  And I'm not one for moving on.   Things I miss about Columbia:  1. Flatbranch. 2. Trops.  NOBODY here sells to-go alcoholic beverages in styrofoam cups.  This is why other countries hate America. 3. The really rundown Sub Shop (yes, just one can be singled out as such - the one by Columbia Mall) because it has a table-console Ms. Pacman. 4. The Olde Un.   Things I do not miss about Columbia:  1. Cars, cars, cars up and down my street. 2. Sporting event crowds. 3. Columbia Mall. 4. The horrible ladies at that quilting shop.  I do, however, thinking of J-Dub every time I see a Tiger Tail hanging out of the trunk of a car.   Big plans  So I had an idea for a mix tape while struggling home from yoga last night.  I could chronicle Britney & Justin's relationship by using their own music.  Because I can detail everything that happened at the end just by reviewing the last two albums.  Am I the only person that realizes that "Toxic" is NOT an answer to "Cry me a River," but that "Everytime," IS an answer to the last song on Justin's CD?  Example: Justin: You didn't say you're sorry.  I don't understand. Britney: THIS IS MY SORRY.  Hello!!!!!  (I can just imagine Abby saying Britney's line in her best pirate/ogre voice.  That's even better than Britney's version.)  Speaking of "Everytime," I think I don't know what to feel about the video.  I liked the idea of the first version where she actually kills herself.  That makes sense.  But the whole "my head is bleeding, maybe I got hit by a video camera, look, it's a baby in a hospital" this is quite strange.  And why is her hair so ugly?  And isn't Stephen Dorff like, 40?  Because he should be.  Anyway, I would start the tape with "Hit me Baby" and "Tearin' up my Heart."  I'm not sure if I would go chronologically or use songs in a non-specific order that would tell the story better.  I do know that I would use "Boys" and "It Makes me Ill."  Oh God, the possibilities.

      Things are on the up and up.  Not my eyesight, though.  Everything is super-blurry.  Perhaps it's time to throw out the old contacts and whip out a new pack.  I think I got contacts in June, maybe July.  I got a year's supply - 12 pairs.  I have only used six.  This could be my problem.   Yarnlust  I am in love with the  urlLink Charlotte's Web  shawl.  I figure it's about $52 to make before tax.  I don't know where I would wear it but I want to try lace.  And it's beautiful.  So many different  urlLink color combinations.    How not to have a successful night at yoga:  1. Change medications several times over the course of two weeks 2. Don't exercise for an entire week beforehand 3. Wear high heels the day of (it works different muscles in your legs than regular shoes) 4. Drink a glass of warm wine a few hours beforehand. 5. Forget to grab a towel before class  I was a sweaty, falling down mess.  And then afterwards, I was so tired that I didn't think I would be able to make it to my car.  I got home in one piece.  Getting up the stairs to my apartment was markedly more difficult.  Then I took a bath with salts that Chrissy gave me and I didn't get out until the water was cold.  I have never been happier to see a Friday.  Hello, Friday.  I love you.

       Today is better.   For now, at least.  I'm making it very clear upfront that I have absolutely no control over my emotions.  It gets scary, but I keep forgetting that it also gets better.  I watched  Love Actually  last night.  I still love that movie.  My favorite part is the whole thing.  Best dinner ever: pork chops stuffed with pesto and feta, rubbed with pepper, garlic and oregano.  Bake for 35 minutes at 375.  Amazing.  I could use some sort of baked good right about now.

      Oh no.  The tears are back.  I was tearless yesterday.  No more.  Everything is horrible.  Just terribly, terribly shitty.  I spent Monday crying crying crying at work and I went to the doctor.  I'm back on Prozac.  Thank God.  It wasn't only the immediate side effects that bothered me, but the ones that don't go away after the first few weeks - anxiety, insomnia, nausea (no wonder people lose weight on it) and my favorite, SEIZURES.  It just wasn't worth it.  And now I'm in this place, thie horrible place where I don't want to do anything or see anyone or be awake and why oh why am I even alive?  Because nothing is worth it and nothing makes me happy and I'm tired of feeling jittery and my mind is running in a million directions and I seriously just want to go back home to Iowa where things are safe and I'm not alone and I don't have to sit in a cube for 7.5 hours a day doing absolutely nothing.  I am scared of myself.  I won't do anything to hurt myself (because that would hurt other people a lot and I don't want to hurt anyone) but I will probably yell and be horrible and think thoughts that scare me.  But the thought of going to sleep and never having to wake up is rather appealing, except for the fact that I'm afraid to sleep.  And I can't remember which Kleenex I just sneezed in and which I used to wipe my tears.  I feel like I did when I moved here almost a year ago.  My apartment doesn't feel like home and I'm tired of Roo because all he does is poop and hate me and I wish I could give him to a school but I would feel bad because the kids would probably squeeze him but he smells bad and I've tried everything besides getting him "fixed."  If I had vacation time I would take it and get the hell out of here, but I don't.  So I will just sit and cry and dread going home at night because I really having nothing to go home to.  I don't want to knit, I don't want to cook, I don't want to watch TV.  I just want my mom and my dog.  That's all.

      Abby left this morning.  We had a great time.  We dyed my hair and it looks awesome.  She made a cake and we watched six hours of  Jem .  We have 18 to go.  I was getting really pissed at Rio because even though Jem and Jerrica are the same person, he didn't know that and he was making out with both of them!  Rio!  You're a slut!  I know that eventually she tells him, but sweet Jesus it was pissing me off.  I've been pretty sick all weekend.  The side effects of Wellbutrin are not fun.  I will not go into graphic detail, but suffice it to say that I've had a lot of general torso and intestinal pain.  Antacids are helping, but they don't help the crying.  I cry for no reason at all.  I cried during Jem, for God's sake.

      I painted my toenails this morning.  They're magenta and gorgeous.  I also got to watch my favorite quilting show,  Simply Quilts .  It was enough to make me want to spend the day at home.  But I'm at work instead.  We just had a potluck and I'm stuffed.  Mmmm cake.  Okay, I was able to sign up for Gmail (I guess all other Blogger users can,too) and I'm doing some research on it for work.  So send me e-mail with unusual subject lines and text, like talking about your favorite store or shoes or whatever.  We're trying to see how the text links work and the searchability of the mailbox.  Address: kristinbuel@gmail.com.  (If you're sending me something important/personal, send it to my regular address)  I'm doing my very first negotiation this afternoon.  I'm nervous.  I don't want to screw this up.

       All Clear  I feel a lot better now.  Thank you for being good friends and making me laugh out loud.  I wasn't looking for comments like that (for real).  It just...it gets noisy in my head sometimes.  It used to be really bad - before I started Prozac again a few years ago, it was so loud inside my head that I couldn't think or sleep for four months.  Anyway, last night was the first night in weeks that I've been able to drive home without thinking all those horrible/annoying thoughts.  I didn't arrive home all tense and angry and I even sang in the car.  It felt so good.  I felt a lot lighter.

      Dear World, I have tried so hard to be what you want.  All I want is for people to like me and not whisper about me behind my back.  But I'm tired, World.  I'm tired of not saying what I really think.  I'm tired of hiding the things I love in life, the things that make me take off my clothes and dance around the bathroom, just because they're "uncool."  I am tired of feeling that I'm not good enough.  Because I used to be.  I used to be one of the best, even.  I used to really like myself and be proud of myself and now I find myself worrying why someone won't talk to me or why someone who hasn't seen me in months would make fun of me in front of friends.  And it's easy to say that I could blow it off or that I didn't care.  But I do.  I care a lot.  I'm never going to stop caring.  But I'm really tired of hiding, of downplaying my actual personality and becoming some sort of half-dead toad, a bump on the conversational log.  This is what I've been too afraid to say.  Don't classify me as a "that girl who knits."  I like to knit.  It's something I do.  It's not who I am, it's not the only interesting or strange thing about me and you are certainly not ever in your whole entire life getting something I made.  Don't treat me like I'm weird or old or unhip.  I am happy and it keeps me from strangling you when you say something stupid.  If you don't want to hang out with me, just say so.  Blowing me off all the time isn't cool, nor is making lame excuses as to why you're too busy.  Actually, it really hurts my feelings.  I can't figure out why you don't want to hang out time after time after time.  Do you not like me?  Because I'm starting to really think you don't.  And I miss you.  A lot.  That's why I call.  I am allowed to like the Smashing Pumpkins and Liz Phair and *NSYNC all at the same time.  I'm even more allowed to like *NSYNC best of all.  My boyfriend, the music snob of the Western Hemisphere (followed closely by Paul, who is also very courteous) has the common courtesy to not make fun of them and even enjoys some of their songs.  If he can do that, I'm sure everyone else can keep their mouths shut.  I don't enjoy going to bars.  I'd rather talk, not scream, at someone.  And I hate having to shower when I get home so my pillow doesn't smell like my smokey hair.  I hate capri pants.  I also hate people who wear lace-up shirts to work.  I despise flip flops.  They should never be worn outside of a setting involving water and/or athlete's foot.  Your feet just look stupid in them.  NOBODY looks good in flip flops.  My mouse is clean.  He bathes about 10 billion times a day.    I'm not a big fan of cats.  There are certain cats I really like, but that's because they don't act like cats.  Given a choice, I'd rather not take a shower.  Or a bath.  I'm all about the dirty.  People who always talk about their weight make me uncomfortable.  I feel like they're judging me because I ate a second brownie.  People who say they can't eat a certain type of food because of their diet make me even more uncomfortable.  If we're going to talk about food, let's talk about how much we love it.  Even though I only tell people the dumb and annoying things my boyfriend does, he is, without a doubt, the most wonderful, loving, generous person I have ever met.  He makes me feel like I'm home.  I hate Snow White.  HATE HER.  I wish she would have just died in the forest while she beat the ground and cried.  I am ashamed that I have to take anti-depressants.  It's embarrassing to me.  But if I didn't, I probably wouldn't leave the house.  Sometimes I feel closer to the knitting bloggers I've never met than to people I hang out with on a pretty regular basis.  I really wish I had a girlfriend to watch movies and eat cookie dough with.  I wish I had someone who I didn't feel stupid telling personal things to.  I wish I had someone who didn't find me strange.  I love musicals, but I really hate the traditional ones.   Cats  and  Bye Bye Birdie  top that list.  If I wanted to kill someone, I would make them listen to "We Love You Conrad" over and over and over again.  Because I had to do that and I wanted to die.  Love, Kristin

      There is this strange satisfying feeling you get when your parents leave after a weekend visit.  You remember when you were so depressed when they left, that you didn't know how you were going to get through the days until you could see them again and how in the world were you going to take care of yourself?  Now you're glad that they love your apartment and the city in which you live and you're excited to see them next but you also relish the quiet and clean house they left behind.  Roo is just glad Penny is gone.  She gives quite the kisses.  VH1 gives out some damn good chocolates.  Yay for rep gifts and yay for bosses whose doctor says she can't eat them.  I had every intention of sewing up my tank top today, but sleeping and lifting weights got in the way, as did working on a gift for my secret pal.  I also lost Justin Timberlake in the midst of all that and finally found him in my car where Coldplay usually is (Coldplay, incidentally, is in my alarm clock).  We slept with the windows open the past few nights.  It was great.  I was in The Nest with my dog.  She got her butt stuck under the bed both nights.  She's horribly allergic to pollen and can't stop scratching.  I suggested Claritin, but that idea was nixed.  I started the new medicine yesterday.  It may cause seizures.  Keep an eye on me.  Happy day-after-birthday to Chuck B., who was lucky enough to spend it with me.

       Big boy mouse   My little mouse is all growed up.  Roo has become a man.  Not a man-man, but a man-mouse.    He has a penis and I saw it.  It's very small.  Itty-bitty, teensy-weensy, if you will.  But it's there.  And I saw it.  Justin saw it, too.    I've been hearing weird things coming from his cage, a kind of clanging sound, but I was always too lazy to get up and see what he was doing.  As we sat at the kitchen table last night and looked at a Hy-Vee circular, I heard the noise and looked over to Roo.  He was chewing on the bars of his cage.  Which totally makes sense, because mice like to chew.  But Roo never has before.  I gave him a toilet paper tube about a week or two after I got him and he was totally not interested.  So I cut up a Kleenex box last night and gave him part of it, and sure enough he was chewing away in seconds.  Then I picked him up and we were playing and he wrapped himself around my finger and did some sort of flip and that's when I saw his mouse-parts.  Itsy-bitsy mouse-parts.  It makes sense.  I figured he wasn't more than a month old when I got him and it's been two months since and a mouse is full-grown/adult at 12 weeks.  I'm hoping this means he will stop pooping every five seconds.  But he better not start smoking and bringing home slutty girl mice.  There's only so much a mother can take.

       Closure   It's been nearly a week since I finished the first and only season of  My So-Called Life .  It was emotionally draining.  I felt like I was in high school all over again.  I yearned through all 19 episodes (I'm not sure what I was actually yearning for, but I did indeed feel a yearning.  That's a really weird word.).  I wanted so badly for Jordan Catalano to finally treat Angela like a human being and for Brian to just get the hell out of her house; I wanted her and Rayanne to be friends again, but be friends with Sharon, too; I wanted Ricky to feel loved and have a place to live; I wanted Angela's dad to stay away from the Hallie Lowenthal person.  I think it's sometimes dangerous to go that far back into your past, especially to a time with so much emotion attached to it.  (It should be noted that in addition to watching the show, I reconnected with very close friends from my middle school and high school days.)  I kept wondering why I wasn't more popular and why did I always feel left out and why why why can't those people see that I actually made something of my life and, most importantly, found someone who would love me unconditionally.  Why?  Why did I feel so alone, so separated from my class all those years?  Why did I feel so ugly and ignored and generally hated?  But I dealt with that.  And last night, as I listened to Justin talk about friendships, I realized I have my own Jordan Catalano, halting speech patterns and all.  Except this boy can read.   More to come  - revelations about the mouse.  But I have a meeting now.

      My mom's sweater is called "Bed and Breakfast Pullover," but I've decided to rechristen it "Mokey," like the wise Fraggle from  Fraggle Rock .  And I like saying "Mokey."  It's turning out really well.  Now that the ribbing is actually started, it's not nearly as wide.  My stitch guage is right on, but the row guage is not.  Luckily, Jennifer, She of Knitting Wisdom, told me that if I did some simple math it would turn out all right.  And she's right!  I'm going to start the armhole shaping tonight.  This is a gorgeous sweater and so incredibly soft.  I want to get some in-progress pictures and post them, which leads us to...  The quest for the perfect blog continues.  I signed up for Typepad (again) and it's still hard for me to use on my dial-up at home.  I'm thinking maybe I could tweak this layout until Blogger has upgrades available again.  I really don't want to lose my archives.  They're how I remember what happened in my life.    The weeks go by so fast - I don't dread the end of the weekend as much because I know it'll be back soon enough.  My job is getting better - more work to do, finally - and being able to call Justin locally is icing on the cake.

       This is not the end   Just for kicks this morning, I decided to pass out at the doctor's office.  Fun!  Well, I didn't actually pass out.  But I was close.  It wasn't as horrific as the great 1998 "Let's Puke on the Football Team at the Blood Drive," escapade since no wheelchairs were involved, but I did get some good juice (in a paper Atlanta Bread Company cup, which I have never seen before.  I question the origins of that cup and how many people have used it before me.  I threw it away.).  Everyone's closing their blogs.  I think that's pretty dumb, but that's just me.  I love blogs and I miss all of you who have stopped for professional reasons (which is totally understandable - get fired for something better, like spitting on your boss from a 10 story window).  Tuttle, this means keep your damn blog and be happy about it.  Or else I'm going to make you be a PA all over again.  But I think I am going to start a knitting blog like I once invisioned, now that my darling boyfriend has a broadband connection and has graciously said that I can use it to upload pictures.  Yay, boyfriend!  Also, a big Boyfriend Happy Birthday.  But I'm still older than you.

       Let's try to have a more uncomfortable lunch   A bunch of people from my department (probably 15 or so) went to Baja 600 for Dana's birthday.  Who do we sit by?  People from my old place of employment, including a little man who didn't like me so much.  Wow!  Could this get any more uncomfortable?  It was really nice to see the other people, especially my mentors.  I miss them a lot.  They are so nice and sweet and taught me a lot.  We were  right  next to their table.  I tried to imagine what things would be like if I had gotten hired there.  Then I looked at everyone at our huge table and I am so glad I'm where I am.  Lucky duck, I am.  But not so lucky on the sweater front.  WHY THE HELL CAN'T I READ?  I open up a pattern and suddenly become a total moron.  Hey, Kristin, when the directions say "Begin with the foundation row," why can't you just  do  that?  Thanks to the episode of  MSCL  where Ricky leaves home, I did and everything looks much, much better now.  I will be 85 by the time I get to the sleeves.

       Self-promotion   I updated this thing three times yesterday, and the last two just now got on.  Please read.  Because I said so.  I am 23 years old.  The only explanation of why I almost went into cardiac arrest when Jordan was making out with Angela in the boiler room last night is because Jared Leto was actually probably 23 at the time and not in high school, which makes me not so dirty and perverted.  OH GOD is he a good kisser.  I swatched FOUR times for my mom's sweater.  I've never swatched that much.  The pattern called for 9s but I'm using 10.5s.  It took me three and then some episodes to swatch (episode one), cast one and work four rows completely wrong two different times (the rest).  The first time, I couldn't read.  The second time, I couldn't read the chart.  But this is my first time working with a chart.  The sweater is seeming really...wide, but I've only done three rows and it's in a 2-4 rib pattern, so it will undoubtedly not be that wide once the rib gets going.  Right?  And there are cables EVERYWHERE.  And I can't find my stupid cable needle.  So I'm using a 7 dpn, which is working quite smashingly, actually.  My goals tonight is not to have to rip the thing to hell and back.  I am, technically, an intermediate knitter, but I've never attempted a project of this magnitude.  I'm usually all about color, not texture.  This should be really neat.  That is, if I don't keep holding the 7 dpn in my mouth between cables.  Bamboo tastes like total crap.

       Introductions   It has come to my attention that I haven't introduced everyone.  I will not, in Bridget Jones manner, say things like "Justin enjoys correcting people's grammar and belching before he kisses his girlfriend."  I will say:  Clare is a year older than me and lived in FARC until she went to England the second semester of my sophomore year.  The first time I met Clare was at a party they dragged some freshman to and she was very drunk and sat on a glass table without realizing it was glass.  It was at that same party that Paul, Justin, and I talked about opening a brothel.  Kate is a year younger than me.  She moved out of FARC when I did and worked at the front desk.  She loves Penny Lane from  Almost Famous  and is dating our former Captain Condom, Adam Henerey.  Erin is a year younger than me as well.  She was a PA during my last year in FARC and her FIG had to have a stern talking-to about not having sex with the masses.  She is an English major and is the proud owner of a Kristin Buel blanket.  Abby is a pirate.  She sails the high seas with her younger sister, Olivia, who holds the position of Littlest Crack Ho.  She enjoys calling the 80s.  Sara H is Adrian's wife.  I didn't believe she existed until I moved here because everybody talked about her but I never actually met her.  I thought Adrian just had a made-up wife or something.  (He's done stranger things - remember "spooky-wooky"?)  She has a fabulous book collection and is probably too smart to be my friend.  I'm sure she'll figure that out soon enough.  Dave is Dave of the Fabulous Hair.  As I've said many times before, he once wore all the clothes in the lost and found AND he owns his own tuxedo.  You know who nobody talks about any more?  John of FARC.  I loved John of FARC, especially when he wanted everyone to have a Rascal, one of those motorized chairs.  He made it a Third Floor priority.

       Since I'm on here  Let's talk about taxes.  I found myself ripping up forms and yelling "No new taxes!" around 9:30 last night, somehow channeling a much younger, much more beautiful George Bush, Sr.  I had Turbo Tax to do the federal and Kansas taxes.  It decided that I was claiming all these education credits and I clearly wasn't, so of course I called my parents to find out what was wrong and of course my dad was in Mount Joy, examining the road where he fell off his bike two weeks ago.  Because, obviously, that will give him some sort of clue as to why the entire right side of his body is, as my mom said, "one giant scab."    I figured out Kansas and federal, did a long download for the second time, and then started Missouri.    Here's the rub: I have never been a resident of Missouri.  While I went to school there, I was technically an Iowa resident because I was technically a dependent of Charles Albert Buel (although, for many years, he was dependent on me to make his lunch, thereby forcing me to by hot lunch every day because I didn't have time to make my own lunch).  I worked in Missouri.  In fact, I had three places of employment in Missouri in 2003 alone.  Then I moved to Kansas.  I also was employed in Kansas for a bit (because that $3.97 from Borders each week made a big difference in my extravagant lifestyle).  So I had to do a Missouri form for a person who didn't live there but worked there AND had income from another state.  I didn't have that form.  I mistakenly filled out the form Mizzou sent me (God forbid anything, including my non-membership to the Alumni Association, be correct), realized it was wrong and found a different form online.    I think I'm done now.  I owe Kansas $252 and Missouri owes me $24.  Because that TOTALLY evens out.

       We interrupt this pretty good day at work for...   AMAZING BREAKING NEWS.  The love of my young life, Chris Bollig, has reappeared.  Despite stories of heiresses and monastaries, he is back and found me and this could possibly be the best day EVER.  Besides the day when Abby, Nanie, Miss and I saw Janet Jackson and danced to the new *NSYNC CD in Miss's car while she tried to find a parking spot.  But this day is definitely up there.  Gay Jim has been accounted for, but where is Nick?

      I've found something the people are passionate about:  My So-Called Life.   I am also quite passionate about  The Cosby Show  and  Designing Women .  I used to be passionate about  The West Wing  before it went down the crapper.  If you were a character in  MSCL , who would you be?  I think that's a tough question because the show does a good job of showing the scope of a person's personality, not just one part that makes them "good" or "bad."  I think I would be Tino.

      Kate, maybe we're not friends anymore.  YOU FELT BAD FOR BRIAN KRACKOW?  Let's go over why we should never feel bad for him.  1. He likes Angela AND Sharon for no apparent reason, except for the fact that they are female and hates them because they don't like him back.  THEY WON'T KNOW IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM.  (And anyway, it is so not cool to like two friends.) 2. Even though he completely dislikes Rayanne (is that how you spell her name?  Whatever.), he hopes that she tells people they got it on while they were locked in the steam room on Halloween. 3. He tells Delia he doesn't want to go to the dance with her just because Angela asked to ride with them to the dance.  And Angela even said WE ARE NOT GOING TOGETHER.  In my book, that is the greatest sin.  You DO NOT cancel a dance date.  DO NOT.  It's just mean and she was new and, for reasons unbeknownst to me, was totally into him. 4. He keeps showing up to Angela's house and just stands there.  Danielle is the only one who likes him, and she is 10 times more annoying than any front-desk loiterer. 5. He won't stand up to Angela.  Grow a spine.  His only redeeming quality is the fact that, after Delia touched his hand, he thought, "Finally.  An erection caused by human contact."  That made me laugh for quite awhile.  Okay, so we're still friends, but just because you're cute.

      I've been watching a lot of  My So-Called Life .  As in, four episodes every few days.  Netflix just ships them to my door and I suddenly become a freshman completely in love with Jordan Catalano (I didn't watch the initial run of the show - I used to watch the reruns on MTV a few years later).  What is most mystifying to me is my utter contempt and hatred for Brian Krackow.  I HATE HIM.  I will always hate him.  Hate him, hate him, hate him.  He is everything I hate wrapped up in one package - tucked in, button down shirts, big Mitch-like hair and, the most damning of all, the inability to speak a coherent sentence.  He's so completely transparent.  He just really, really wants to touch someone's breasts, anyone's breasts!  Brian Krackow, there will be no breast-touching for you.  I'm about halfway through the series.  I loved boys just like Jordan Catalano.  I loved their flannel shirts and their kind-of-but-not-really long hair and that quiet, introspective-but-probably-stoned gaze.  I don't watch  The O.C.  or any of those other shows.  Maybe this is why.   MSCL  wasn't my life, but it was pretty damn close to what I was feeling.  Not that I identified with Angela.  I identified with that feeling of loneliness even though there are a lot of friends around.  And just one kiss!  That's all I wanted! urlLink

      So I make the big decision to upgrade to Blogger Pro and then I find out that I can't.  Can't someone help a sister out?  I went for a Big Walk to combat the withdrawal-induced (looked it up, Justin was right) sleepiness.  I toddled myself down to Beauty Brands on the Plaza (I LOVE BEAUTY BRANDS) to get my eyebrows waxed and then went to Panache, a chocolatier, for some amazing ice cream.  It was a good long walk and I took a little rest in the Cancer Survivor's Park and listened to the birds sing.  I've been much more awake since I returned.  Which is a good thing, because I'm giving yoga a second go after it totally kicked my ass last week.  Except now it doesn't start until 7:30, which is quite near my "on the couch and don't get up" time.  Pray for me.  I have absolutely no plans for the weekend.  It's lovely.  I'm planning on spending a lot of it in bed and in the sunshine (possibly both at the same time).  I love bed.

      Today is the longest day ever.  Ever.  It's one of those days where you can't eat enough and more than half of it needs to be chocolate.  I have a lot of stuff to do at home before I head to the Buel homestead, but not a lot of time.  I went swimming this morning and then had to leave a half hour early to get to a physical therapy appointment in North KC.  (For some reason, I decided against having breakfast and instead repotted a violet.  I don't know why.)  I have a rep dinner tonight, and then I'll go home, change Roo's cage, pack, fold laundry and try to remember to pay my bills.    I haven't knit in three weeks.  THREE.  I'm bringing the Ab Fab throw home this weekend and I swear to god I'm not leaving the couch.  Oh yes, and I do have a sty on my eye.  I think that's the lazy one.

      I realized this morning that I haven't cried in, like, weeks.  Maybe two.  That's a really long time for me.    I have this thing on my eye.  Can you get a pimple on your eyelid?  Because it's either that or else I have pink eye on the outside of my eye.  Huh.  I'm ready for this week to be over.  I haven't had a day off since New Year's Day and I'm freaking sick of it.  The woman who sits across from me is sick and still comes to work, so of course I'm going to get sick.  My stupid eyes are stupid.  I have to go to physical therapy for the next two days.  I went to aerobics last night and now I want to die.  But you know what I really love?  Those MTV house ads with that girl writing crazy letters to MTV.  I especially love the Britney poem:  Do you sleep Britney Spears, do you sleep? Do you weep Britney Spears, do you weep?   I also enjoy Timmy from  RR  being 40 and when she proposes being  Made  into a biological scientist so she can wreck havoc on the CDC.

      Dear Wind, Clouds and Rain, Gary Lezak promised me you would come to my house at 9 p.m. last night.  First it was 8:20, then 8:50, then 9:00.  Sirens went off.  I went into the bathroom with the Gay Pride Blanket, a big orange pillow, Abby's old alarm clock, a flashlight, a bottle of Hy-Vee black cherry water, Marian Keyes' new book, a box of pretzels and the mouse.  First of all, please note that the  Inferno  finale was to start at 9 p.m.  I was not happy that I would have to be in the bathroom at this time, but I did it for you, Wind, Clouds and Rain.  Second of all, that mouse tried to eat my pretzels.  I opened the box and he climbed onto the walls of his cage and stuck his little nose through the bars and sniffed sniffed sniffed.  I told him no and he got mad and went to bed.  Then I spilled the bottle of water all over the Gay Pride Blanket and the bathroom floor.  Lucky thing I had an Aquis hair towel hanging on the towel rack right above my head.  I stayed in that bathroom until 9:14.  I couldn't really hear the storm since the air conditioner was on, and it happens to be located in my bathroom ceiling.  I came out of the bathroom and...nothing.  No lightning, no rain, no neighbor's roof missing, no nothing.  Listen up.  Don't fuck with me.  Next time you promise a tornado, fucking do it.  I'm sick of this namby-pamby shit.  Love, Kristin  PS - And don't try to tell me that it was okay because the  Inferno  finale sucked.  That does not a rekindled friendship make.

      Sundays are strange days.  I sleep for most of it and go out for groceries.  This Sunday would be a lot better if I could knit.  I think about it, but I never quite get there.  I guess I'm scared that it's going to hurt and then I will be sad.  I'll try tonight.  I have been able to craft, though.  I've been making some AWESOME things for my secret pal.  I also made my own stitch markers yesterday, and they turned out very well for the whopping $2.27 I spent on the materials.  It also gave me a change to dive into my closet for all my beading materials.  Remember when I spent the summer living at the Crowley's (as in Sue) and beaded coasters every single night?  I have some half-finished ones and I threw those away.  The coasters don't work so well with a condensating beverage.  I'm sure a condecending beverage wouldn't be so nice, either.  Anyway, I finally found my pliers and wire cutters, along with a kajillion vials of beads.  I.  Love.  Beads.  And I love making stitch markers.  I'm giving them to everyone, whether they knit or not.  I ended up going into work for a bit yesterday.  It's a mixed-up story, but I was in the neighborhood and wanted to go to The Studio because I hadn't been there for a month, at least, but it wasn't open until 10.  It was 9:15 at the time.  So I decided, what the hell, I'll go clean off my desk and get some stuff done.  It was pretty nice, actually.  And when I left, I ran into the VP of the department.  So my efforts were not unnoticed.  I'm glad I stayed to go to the bathroom.    So then I visited The Studio.  They have a bunch of new lines of yarn and I was tempted more than once.  They're actually having an  Interweave Knits  trunk show right now and have samples of the garments in the magazine.  They had the tank I wanted to make, but I restrained myself.  I can't knit very well right now anyway, so why add insult to injury?  I bought  Cool Socks, Warm Feet  by Lucy Neatby, and it was even autographed.  I also bought a back issue of  Interweave Knits  that has three (three!) sweaters I want to make.  I can't wait for the Yarn Shop to open.

      Yesterday was an Eating Day.  Baja 600 and Tomfoolerie's.  No fried pickles.  I love fried pickles.  I ate cookies for breakfast.  At least they're gone now.  I'm in dire need of a candy.  That shall be my motivation for writing reports.    I passed out at 7:30 last night, after I talked to Abby (who is indeed in Iowa).  Justin came over at 9:30 and I woke up all sweaty.  Sexy.  We stayed up for an hour and then I went back to bed.  I love bed.  I do not love physical therapy.  It's hard.  I had to do all these forearm stretches and move putty with my hands.  Afterwards, they put an ENORMOUS ice pack (the size of a pillow) into a pillowcase and wrapped it around my arm for 10 minutes.  Imagine putting dry ice directly on your skin.  I was glad when that was over.  I think I told Justin last night that Roo doesn't like motor vehicles.  I don't know why I said that, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't.  He's more of a self-propelling kind of guy.  Everytime I think of watching  All the President's Men  (on extended loan from the library), I think of  urlLink Autumn  because she sat outside Bob Woodward's office.  For some reason, I think that Bob Woodward looks like Robert Redford, and then I think how lucky Autumn is.  And now everytime I think of Robert Redford (which is quite a bit, actually), I think of Autumn.  Autumn, are you holding something back from me?  I once saw Robert Redford's house in Sundance.  We were riding horses up a mountain and the guide pointed to a house built into the side of the mountain across from us.  He said, "I can't tell you who lives there."  There was no road to get to the house.  So Robert Redford must be able to beam himself places.  Too bad he didn't beam himself out of that movie with Michelle Pfieffer about the news anchors.  That movie blew.

      Not carpal tunnel.  I got sent to Corporate Care for Worker's Comp and it's tendonitis.  Thank the holy lord.  It still hurts like a bitch, but at least it's not permanent damage.  Now I get to have physical therapy (whee!) and take different drugs.  I also get new office equipment.  Hoo-ray.  This whole thing reminds me of  Clue  when Mrs. White (played by the darling Madeline Kahn) says, "Flames.  Flames going up the side of my head."  Because that's what my arm feels like.  If it was my head, that is.

      No, wait, I'm a gimp.  I am the proud owner of carpal tunnel in my right hand.  Yesss.  That's one life goal completed.  I'm trying to learn how to use the computer mouse with my left hand.  Do you know how hard it is to format an Excel document with your left hand?  Really hard.  I'm able to type without pain so far today (way to go 500 mg anti-inflamatories!) and I have filed a worker's comp claim.  Welcome to my American dream.   Wonderings  1. Where is Abby?  More to the point, which state is she in? 2. Why do I keep getting Sex and the City DVDs I've already seen? 3. When will I be able to knit again? 4. Where the hell is all my underwear?  I'm thinking clean in the laundry basket, but I've been throwing it out like its Kleenex for the past few weeks.   5. Why do I like squash so much and why did I not know this until two months ago?

      If you're looking for cinema to make you physically ill, I highly suggest  Requiem for a Dream .  The last 10 minutes really made me want to hurl.  I have a bum hand.  My wrist got really jacked up when I worked late last week, entering stuff into spreadsheets, and I haven't really been able to knit since then.  My whole hand started to hurt at Adrian and Sara's late Friday night and was quite swollen.  I knit for a little while yesterday, but had to ice my hand afterwards.  It's the computer mouse that's doing it, so now I'm trying to navigate with my left hand.  It's not as hard as I thought it would be, but still not too easy.  I really want to knit at Guild tonight, so I'm not taking any chances today.  And I think I'm going to ask for some ergonomical solutions from my friendly IT person.  At the risk of sounding like a slutty co-ed, I had my first hangover this weekend.  At 8 p.m. on a Saturday night.  Connie sure makes some good punch.  Justin and I had the best time at the birthday barbecue.  Okay, my right hand is killing me just from typing.  It's going to be a long day.

      Now that I have the ability to actually post a title, I can't think of any.  The above is an e-mail, in its entirety, that I sent to a co-worker.  My weekly "Headache at 4:00 on Thursday afternoon" has joined me an hour early today.  Way to go, headache!  I worked until 7:45 last night.  I got home at 8:15.  I ate cooked and ate dinner (campanelle pasta and feta with sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic), talked to my parents on the phone and was in bed by 9:15.  That's when the Indian family across the yard started screaming goodbyes to their friends.  It only lasted about 10 minutes.  Justin and I need suggestions on "how to have fun."  It turns out that we don't.   An open letter   Dear Friday, If you don't get here soon, there will be carnage. Love, Kristin

      I've been grumpy for the past few days.  Sorry, Pookie.   ANTM: The Runway Ahead  First of all, it was like, 10 times better than the Friends finale.  But that's not saying much.  Second of all, WHY IS CAMILLE SUCH A RAGING BITCH?  God, I hate her.  I also hate stupid Catie giving stupid autographs.  And Xiomara, I'm sorry, but you will never make it, not with that scary agent of yours.  Ooo, someone at work just gave me some shoes.

      The baby mouse is all better - I think his little bump is gone.  Poor Roo-Roo - I poked and prodded him so much last night that he made his "mad face" - he scrunched up his little nose and buried his head in my fingers.  But at least he's okay.  I turn off the air conditioning while I'm at work, and when I come home he's laying on top of his bedding instead of covering himself with it, and he's all stretched out like Penny.  Maybe I'll make him a little mouse fan.

      First, a big 'ol thank you to my Secret Pal, who sent me some rockin' notecards, stickers and gorgeous stitch markers.  I love them.  And I'm a big poop for not thanking you a week ago when I received them.  Thank you so much.   Best News EVER  I now work at a yarn store.  I KNOW.  It's a new shop, not too far from my house, called The Yarn Store and More.  It opens on June 1.  I'll be working Sundays 1-5.  I get a 40% discount.  AND I get to make things to display in the store and they pay me for them in yarn (or cash, but I'm all about the yarn)!  I met one of the three owners on Saturday and she's just fabulous.  We were in the stock room, looking at all the yarn, and I mentioned that I had always wanted to make the Colinette Absolutely Fabulous Throw kit but that it was too expensive.  And she says, "I have some of those!  Want to make one for the store?"  And that's how I walked out of the store 10 minutes later with $180 worth of Italian yarn and my first pair of Addi Turbo needles (which I already adore).  I started winding the yarn right when I got home and I'm about 1/7 of the way through the blanket.  It's absolutely gorgeous.    The great thing about this job is that I love to make things but I don't want to keep everything I make.  And I'm going to be one of two crocheters, and they want to have a lot of crocheting stuff in the store (Jo went to a retailer's conference last weekend and they said crocheting was going to be the "next big thing").  They're going to have a bunch of couches and chairs to use for knitting and Wednesday nights will be open knitting night.  They're also really into charity knitting and philanthropy - they're going to be the only/first store in the area to carry Manos del Uraguay, yarn that's made by women in Uraguay and the profits go directly back to those women.  The classroom table is an old dining room table and there's going to be tomato and vine stands hanging from the ceiling to hang scarves.  I can't wait.   But now I'm worried  Little Roo has a little lump on his side.  It's kind of like a skin tag.  Maybe he scratched himself too much or something and it's just a wound.  But I'm worried that he has a tumor.

      I finally finished watching  The Wiz  last night.  Have you seen  The Wiz ?  This isn't the Fred Savage movie about Nintendo.  This is the 1978 Motown version of  The Wizard of Oz .  I'd seen it before but didn't remember much -  I think I fell asleep halfway through (incidentally, that viewing was the first night Abby and I spent together without other friends.  It cemented our relationship.  We also watched  Krush Groove , starring Run DMC, Sheila E. and The Fat Boys.  I now own it.)  Anyway.  If you haven't seen  The Wiz , do it.  Now.  It's amazing.  Diana Ross is Dorothy, Michael Jackson is the Scarecrow, Nipsey Russell is the Tin Man and the Lion is Ted Ross, the guy who won a Tony for it on Broadway in 1974.  Lena Horne is Glinda and Richard Pryor is the Wizard.  It's set in New York City.  Dorothy is a kindergarten teacher and lives with her Aunt Em.  She's scared to take a new job at a high school and move out on her own.  Toto runs outside and a blizzard sweeps them away.  Oz is actually NYC - Justin recognized a bunch of the locations.  I watched a featurette about how it was made, and it was really astonishing.  It's hard to describe, but there's this scene with 400 dancers (the Emerald City) and the backdrop is two big buildings kind of angling the set.  It takes place at night and the buildings are only lit by lights in the windows.  It turns out that they were the World Trade Center towers.  It's a gorgeous scene - I orginally thought it was just a backdrop.  The music, arranged and retooled by Quincy Jones, is spectacular.  I think the best part, though, is that it is so much truer to Frank L. Baum's original story.  Dorothy wears silver slippers in the original, and so does Diana Ross.  In the original, there are two good witches, not just Glenda.  All of those people on the farm don't become the cast of characters.  On and on and on.  It's much more poignant and emotional - you actually care if Diana Ross gets home.  Anyway.  See it.  I really want it on DVD, so if I get it, everyone is invited to watch.

       Really big important question   The  Friends  finale is this week?  For real?  Because I thought it was next week.  I've thought that since, like, July, when I was doing avails for Captain D's.  Swear to God.    So should I watch it?  I only watched one episode this season (the first) and I have yoga at 7:30 on Thursday nights.  The only thing I find remotely interesting about it is that advertising rates are just a few hundred dollars less than the Super Bowl during the actual show, and the rates on the  Tonight Show  that night and  Today  the next day are astronomical, and those are just local rates.  (They've been planning the entire cast to be on those shows for at least a year now.  I'm sorry, but I wouldn't pay $1000 to be anywhere near Katie Couric's crazy eye shadow.)  What do I do?

       Sometimes it's a relief when the weekend is over.   I think one of the hardest parts about being in a relationship is looking over at the person you've been sleeping next to for nearly four years and thinking, "Who the hell ARE you?"  I know Justin better than I know anyone else except for my dog, but I still have no clue about him at all.  I have no idea what goes through his head or how he operates.  Those moments are stressful and often horrible.  But when the crying and fighting are over, everything feels new and fresh again.  He describes it as the fires that gut out the forest so new growth can emerge.  That's the best description I've ever heard.   In other news  I made a container garden this weekend.  Cutting-edge, according to my mother.  It has a daylily in the center, then clamysia (?), which has tall red, yellow and orange flowers, and then English ivy that will cascade over the sides of the pot.  I put Roo into a box of dirt while I cleaned his cage.  He was supposed to like it.  All the mouse websites say that mice love digging in dirt.  Roo's tail got really dirty and he was all pissed off and tried to dig through the box.  I gave him a few Toastie-O's - he ate one and buried the rest.   urlLink Kate  stopped by for mangled chicken parmesean and good conversation yesterday afternoon.  It was really great.

      Work is funny.  Funny as in strange, as in all of a sudden I feel like I belong here and I have friends outside of my own little working group and I don't feel left out.  This is the first time I've ever felt like that since...ever?    Overheard during lunch: Intern: In February, he dropped the L-Bomb. Other Interns: (huge gasp) Inside my head: Will somebody just shoot her now? Co-worker: (belabored breathing and furious turning of magazine pages)  Today a division of our company had a dessert buffet for the rest of us and I ate the best chocolate cake EVER.  They also had teeny-tiny Ben and Jerry's containers.  Adorable.   The Great CD Challenge:  32.  The Full Monty , Original Cast Recording 33.   Trainspotting vol. 2 , Various  34.

      I pulled out my copy of  The Knitting Goddess  this morning.  It was my first real knitting book - a major step up from the 10-page pamphlet that came in the I Taught Myself How to Knit! kit.  Each time I leaf through the pages, I remember why I knit.  It's such a deeply spiritual and grounding activity for me.  When the yarn is strung through the fingers on my right hand and my hands work in tandem, I feel a strong silk cord tying me to the knitters who came before me.  Everything around me fades and the only things I know to be true are the softness of the yarn and the rhythm of my fingers.  There's a calmness that no other activity brings.  I think I've forgotten all of that lately and just concentrated on how many projects I have going and how two of them really, really need to be finished.  I've been thinking about changing my profession to something fiber-related, but the more I think about it, the more I come to realize that knitting is what I look forward to all day and yarn stores are where I feel the most relaxed.  If those two things just became status quo, what would I have to look forward to?  I never want it to become a chore.  I wonder.   The Great CD Challenge  19.  Enema of the State , Blink 182 20.

      Remember when I said I would send you the CDs I didn't want anymore?  Total, complete lie (sorry, Nell!  That one was scratched, anyway).  I don't have the cases for any of them because I keep them in a big CD notebook and really, I'm just too lazy.  Besides, I'm throwing them away right after I decide I don't like them.

      I was in fiber overload last night.  Like, seriously, I had to go to bed before my head exploded.  My thoughts were filled with yarn of every color and weight and I have so much stuff to make and I can't even take it.  Agh!  But Justin talked me down and I fell asleep and everything was better.  At The Yarn Shop last night, I met a woman named Mary Jane.  Mary Jane's probably in her late 80s or early 90s.  She was having crocheting problems, and they told her to come back to see me.  So she did.  In the end, it turned out that it was her yarn, not her.  The yarn just wouldn't hold the ripple pattern.  We talked for quite awhile, and she told me I was "a joy."  She apologized for swearing, and I said that I always swear when I crochet, so we swore together.  She's coming back to see me on Sunday.  The best part is that this man brought Mary Jane to the store (she's on an oxygen tank, so driving isn't really easy for her).  She explained that he helped out her friend, and she was just borrowing him for the night.  She said he was 52, but he looked a lot older and skeezier than that.  When she called him to come pick her up at the store (he gets antsy, she said, so he went home), his line was busy.  Mary Jane said that he was probably on the phone with his girlfriend, who is 26.  We agreed that neither of us would date this jobless man no matter how old we were.    The worst part is that when we realized she needed some more sport weight yarn to pair with what she already had to give it some dimension.  We don't have anything of that weight that's machine washable in the store, and since she was making a baby blanket, we needed machine washable.  I told her to go to Wal-Mart and get some Red Heart.  And she got really sad.  I asked why and she said because she was really looking forward to having something to do last night because she lives alone and all of her friends or dead or have Alzheimers, and having nothing to do at night is just horrible.  That broke my heart.  Luckily, we convinced her man to take her to Wal-Mart.  I was about to take her myself.   The Great CD Challenge  2.  Titanic , Original Cast Recording 3.

      Two days in a good mood and going strong!  I told Justin last week that I felt lost, in that I lost myself somewhere during the past few weeks.  But I found myself.  I was hiding in some dirty sheets and an uncut watermelon.  Now that those things are fixed, I'm suddenly back.  I should wash my sheets more often.  So.  I bought some Crystal Palace cotton chenile to make an awesome flower washcloth, but the damn thing requires size 6 dpns (double-pointed needles), and I'm pretty sure I don't have those.  So I'll either make a really big washcloth or a really little washcloth.  I haven't used the Denise needles yet, but I've opened the case quite a few times just to love them.   The last time I did this, Billy Joel nearly killed me  Every few years, I do this thing where I listen to every single one of my CDs without repeating a disc.  The reasons for this are too numerous to explain, but the short version is if I can't get through an entire CD, it's time to get rid of it.  The only caveat to this is that I don't have to listen to the Christmas CDs.  Unless I want to listen to the *NSYNC Christmas CD, because it's really good.  My CDs are in categories, and alphabetized within that category.  Categories include: regular, run-of-the-mill CDs, then CDs that are compilations, holidays, movie soundtracks, and Broadway cast recordings.  The last time I got all the way through this without giving up was in high school.  I have a lot of Billy Joel CDs.  Like, at least nine.  The same with Harry Connick, Jr.  I cannot listen to them all in a row.  That could kill a person.  So this time, I'm mixing it up.  The CDs will mostly be listened to while driving or at work.  I'll keep you posted.  If there's a CD I'm going to get rid of and you want, let me know.   The Great CD Challenge  1.  Liz Phair , Liz Phair

      Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  I ordered a set of  urlLink Denise Interchangeable Knitting Needles  from  urlLink YarnMarket  on Monday morning.  They showed up on my desk today.  The Happy Dance commenced, and I showed them to everyone, even people who don't knit.  Because THEY ARE AMAZING.  A thousand dollars worth of knitting needles for $45 is my idea of a really good time.  To the good people at Denise, I say thank you.  To the good people at YarnMarket, I say thank you.  To Rodney, our mail guy at work, I say it's a good thing I wasn't here when you dropped them off or I would have knocked you down in my crazed joy.  I cannot WAIT to use them.  But I will, because it's time to work.

      I'm all messed up.  I spent Saturday awake, as opposed to my usual six hours of sleep during the day.  During that time, I made $6.25, scored a free table and two sequined fish and got a wicked sunburn.  I worked my first Sunday at The Yarn Shop.  Still awake.  So last night, I went to bed at 6:15.  I got up at 8:30 and was back in bed by 9:15.  I woke up this morning at 5:50, went swimming, then got ready for work AND changed my sheets, washed the dirty ones, ran the dishwasher and vaccuumed the entire apartment.    I have lost all concept of time.  We're having a book fair at work.  I think I just bought a book I already have.  One of you lucky readers may be the recipient of an extra copy of Good Housekeeping's Illustrated Book of Needlecrafts.  Seriously, if you want it, let me know.  If I have two, I'll send you one.  What's with today, today?  (If you can tell me who said that, you win a prize!)

      This week has been particularly blah.  Long and blah.  Blaaaaaaaaah.  Work is...stressful.  I think the worst part is that I'm just exhausted when I come home at night.  Granted, I don't get home until after 7:00 for one reason or another, but the thought of getting off the couch is so taxing that I decide just to fall asleep there instead.  I hope this weekend is relaxing, but I have the feeling it won't be.  We're going to a Royals game tonight (and I will swear in honor of Kara if they stink), The Garage Sale of Garage Sales is tomorrow, and I'm working at The Yarn Shop on Sunday.  And I love The Yarn Shop.  I knit there Wednesday night and I worked last night.  They had me knit.  Yay!  I'm making a bag out of some Plassard F'leur, which feels like crumpled, recycled paper.  But it's going to be a really strong back.  And I think I'm going to get to make a model sweater out of Point 5, which will probably be the most expensive piece of clothing I have ever touched.  I'm so excited.  So excited that I want to fall asleep.  (That reminds me of when my ex-boyfriend, Brian, said, "I'm so excited I could vomit."  I love that.)  Today is Andrea's last day.  It's appropriate that it's raining.

      Tony Awards, what has happened to you?  Remember when I was in high school and watched you for the first time from the comfort of my bed?  Nathan Lane was hosting.  Julie Andrews refused to show up because she was the only one nominated from  Victor/Victoria  and Nathan dressed like her.  It was great.  He was starring in either  Guys and Dolls  or  A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum .  I can't remember.  For the next three years, I taped the awards.  I have every musical performance from that time period on tape.  The awards were always on graduation weekend, and I ALWAYS left graduation parties early to make sure I could watch the pre-show on PBS.  I insisted my own party was on Saturday because NOTHING was going to make me miss that show.  What the hell happened?  I think it's best to describe last night's Tony's by categorizing the players:   People Who Are 500 Years Old  Carol Channing   People Who Rap With People Who Are 500 Years Old  LL Cool J   People Who Are Not Funny, Especially When They Host  Hugh Jackman   People Who Had No Business Being There, Much Less Presenting  Nicole Kidman Renee Zelwinger or however the hell you spell her name  Peo ple Who Should Be In Every Musical  Kristin Chenowith   Musicals I Never Want To See Again  Fiddler on the Roof   People Who Used To Be Black  Brian Stokes Mitchell   People Who Are Amazing  Audra McDonald   People Who I Like Better As Clare Huxtable  Phylicia Rashad   People Who Thankfully Were Not There In Their Post-Cataract-Surgery Glory  Mandy Patankin

       urlLink This  is the kind of mother I will be.  Speaking of "futures," the next person who asks me if: a) I am engaged b) I have plans to get engaged c) I think Justin is "the one" d) I'm ready to get married  is going to get bitch-slapped.  Sure, we've been together four years (tomorrow and Friday, to be exact).  We are best friends.  We fight.  We are a couple.  But we're also 23 and definitely NOT getting married anytime soon.  We like being friends.  We like having our own space and our own apartments.  We like it when Justin unloads the dishwasher and I watch TV, but we also know that will stop as soon as bigger plans are made, and people, I hate unloading the dishwasher.  He's really good at it.

      I just want to say that I have the best secret pal EVER.  I got  urlLink Allison's  last package yesterday and it was amazing.  It had some Mueseum yarn (in Planetarium), which I'm going to make a hat with, some great pink and white SoHo and a Noro I've never used!  It also had chocolate, the cutest little straw box, nail polish that I adore, sake cups and saucers (Justin was way impressed) and a really neat picture frame set that looks like little china plates.  After the horrible, terrible, crappy day I had (I ended up walking out of aerobics, that's how bad it was and I felt), I went to the mailbox and was beside myself.  All my blues flew out the door.  Thank you so much, Allison.  Your gifts always came at the exact right time.  I was  urlLink Jena's  secret pal, and I hope she likes the stuff I made/gave her.  I'm especially proud of the final package, but I also had a great time making the mix tape.  I would definitely do the program again.  I had a hard time getting my act together - I wanted to send stuff out more often, but getting to the post office has never been my strong point.  But I had so much fun making stuff and planning, and opening my own gifts was the icing on the cake.

      I love: * Iowa * Abby * Peep * my mom's hamburgers and onion rings * graduation cake * movies in the basement   The Hunter  Penny has become a hunter.  She chased a deer out of the yard on Saturday.  I didn't see the deer, but I did see her tear off after it.  My dad said he was a "big boy" and Penny probably would have gotten her ass kicked if she actually caught him.  Then she was hunting a ground squirrel that was living in a gutter.  She ripped the long end of the gutter off the part connected to the house and the little ground squirrel cried and cried.  It had been raining all morning (buckets and buckets of rain for hours), and when I looked into the gutter, I could see his little wet tail.  Poor guy.   Because I'm nice...  ...I won't tell you how when we got out of the car at Wal-Mart, some teenage guys hollered in appreciation at my mom, but as their car got closer, they realized that she was, indeed, an older woman, and one yelled, "Woah, no!", covered his head in his hands and slunk down into his seat.  She didn't think it was as funny as my dad and I did.  But believe you me, it was  hilarious .   But now I'm back  Oh god, I have to work.

      In case you haven't heard the news, Fall is all about the poncho.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; You don't have a poncho?&nbsp; ARE YOU INSANE?&nbsp; EVERYBODY NEEDS A PONCHO.&nbsp; IN FACT, YOU NEED ONE RIGHT NOW.&nbsp; DON'T EVEN BUY A PATTERN - JUST ASSUME I KNOW HOW TO MAKE ONE.  I don't have a poncho.&nbsp; I'd kind of like one.&nbsp; Maybe a capelet.&nbsp; But ponchos are HUGE and every single woman who has entered The Yarn Shop either wants to make one or is in the process of making one at this very minute.&nbsp; The Poncho is the new Fuzzy Scarf.  But a poncho can be pretty pricey.&nbsp; I mean, that's a lot of yarn.&nbsp; Especially if you want something glitzy and glittery and full of all that crap.&nbsp; I have $75 in store credit to spend on whatever I want, and I'm leaning towards getting deep pink Calmer for that neat pattern I got from ChicKnits.&nbsp; I'll have to spend about $15 of my own money (not too bad for a sweater that's about $100 in materials) with my discount.&nbsp; Okay, I'm sold on it.&nbsp; I'll buy it tomorrow.&nbsp; In fact, I will probably call the shop in a few minutes and have them hold it for me just in case.&nbsp;    The Great CD Challenge  133.

      I learned an important lesson this weekend.&nbsp; Friends don't let friends felt.&nbsp; And where the fuck were my friends?  I tell you what, this tote I designed for a class I'm teaching at the store nearly killed me.&nbsp; It's taking all of my energy to not set it on fire.  First of all, pre-felting, the thing was bigger than me.&nbsp; Penny could have easily slept in it.&nbsp; And then I made these MONSTER straps, 48" long each, because according to my swatch and calculations, they would shrink to 28" each.&nbsp; Big fat fucking joke.&nbsp; I think they got even LONGER.&nbsp; The bag felted just fine, but the straps were simply out of control.&nbsp; So I hacked off part of each and tied that part that rests on your shoulder in knots and it's actually not half bad.&nbsp; But I knit for 15 hours yesterday and I am never, ever, EVER making a felted&nbsp;bag ever again.&nbsp; EVER.&nbsp; Everything I own smells like wet wool (which is actually worse than wet dog) and I keep finding it in the sink, on my hands, splattered on the washing machine.  It's almost dry.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; I brought it to work with me because we have a store meeting at 6, and I'm handing over the thing then.&nbsp; I'm not keeping it - after the class, the owners get to fight over it.&nbsp; I wrote the pattern this morning, modifying the strap length.&nbsp; Hope it works out.&nbsp; I'm not going to attempt it again.  And whatever happened to making things for myself?&nbsp; That ship sailed long ago.&nbsp; In the next few weeks, I need to make a baby sweater (for my boss who's expecting), two ponchos (for which I will be handsomely compensated) and a hat for a class I'll be teaching in the fall.  In happier, belated news, I bought Hot Knits and it's amazing.&nbsp; I'm going to make everything in there, especially the green, orange and yellow Fair Isle.&nbsp; Gorgeous.  Good news for the week ahead: I'm taking an Excel class Thursday and Friday for work, meaning I only have to drive 5 MINUTES instead of my usual 30 and I'm going to see my favorite pirate this weekend.&nbsp; Yay for pirates!

      1. I HATE The Studio.&nbsp; I'm not going back for the following reasons: they're rude, they wouldn't help the new knitters I brought to the store, and they have a crappy-ass ball winder.   2. It's too fucking hot.&nbsp; Come on, rain.&nbsp; I know you're out there.   3. D'Bronx pizza is, like, the best thing I've eaten all week.&nbsp; Why didn't anybody tell me this before?   4. Even though you get extra money when you get a promotion, it doesn't really count because you'll end up spending it all on therapy because you work for crazy people.&nbsp; CRAZY.   5.&nbsp; Roo has somehow learned how to pee on HIS OWN HEAD.&nbsp; I did not teach him this.   6. I am obsessed with crossword puzzles, logic problems and the like.   7. If my smoke alarm goes off one more time while I'm trying to sleep, I'm going to set the apartment on fire just to give it something to really scream about.   8. Have you seen my boyfriend?&nbsp; HOT.&nbsp; Sometimes I see him from far away and I'm like, who the hell is that hot guy and how can I get him to make out with me?&nbsp; And then I remember, that's my boyfriend and all I have to do is give him that special smile, the non-ugly one that only shows up when he's around.&nbsp; He's easy like that.

      Roo has a new wheel.&nbsp; He's not so sure about it.&nbsp; It's a tad small for him - they were out of the next size up, but I couldn't let him be bored anymore (there is nothing more pathetic than a bored mouse.&nbsp; If he could sigh, he would.&nbsp; He just lays in his bed, all stretched out with his head resting on a pillow, waiting for something to happen).&nbsp; So he has this little wheel, and he takes up about half of it.&nbsp; He's decided that instead of running in it, he will a) climb it until it turns and throws him off and b) spin it from the outside like he's on "The Price is Right."&nbsp; He can't run very fast in it, and he LOVES to run fast.&nbsp; I think I'm going to have to spring for the $10 wheel that attaches to the outside of the cage.&nbsp; Then maybe I'll get him some stuff to climb on for inside the cage.&nbsp; I think he's part mountain goat. &nbsp; There's a new kind of Habitrail cage that's actually just a giant wheel.&nbsp; It's circular, and it has places inside the wheel where he can sleep and eat and play (the wheel rotates around all of that).&nbsp; That would be mouse heaven.

      Tragedy struck at 1725 this morning. Roo finally broke his wheel. How did a little mouse break a thick plastic wheel? Well, Roo has been jumping a lot and likes to use his wheel as a battering ram. So no more wheel for Roo. When I took it out, he went completely nuts. He was climbing the walls, digging where the wheel used to be, just going crazy. He then dove head first into his food dish. I'm going to come home to a 2 lb mouse.   Unfortunately, I don't have time to get a new wheel today. I'm teaching the crochet class from hell, and then I have knitting with the lovely  urlLink Abbey  and  urlLink Kyra . He's going to have to wait until tomorrow. I'm considering getting him a new cage, since this one's kind of falling apart. A bird cage might work - he would have a lot more room to climb.   I dreamt about Muppets. I'm taking a risk here, but I think I was in the shower with Kermit and at the Cheers bar. And I also had a dream about going to prom. Abby was getting ready in the "Forrest Gump Dressing Room."

      WHY do I always have voice messages even though I haven't left my desk?  Why?  Why?  I'm sad today.  I was sad yesterday, too.  And it's one of those sads where you don't know the specific reason, but you kind of have an idea of what's making it stick around.  My dad drove up Wednesday night and we traded cars.  He left yesterday morning.  I miss him.  It's not fair to have him taken away so quickly.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just playing around here until I can go back home.  My apartment doesn't always feel like my home and I keep waiting for my parents to say, "Alright, that part's over!  Come on back!"  So now I have my mom's car.  I miss the HOE car.  I'm not sure if I like the new one.  It's a midnight blue Intrepid with a crazy radio that has a chameleon living inside (he runs across the screen!).  It just doesn't feel like mine, I guess.  Doesn't feel like home.  I guess I'm looking for some home.  Let me just put this out there to brighten your day: I had a dream that I kissed Dave Alexander.  He doesn't kiss like Justin.

      The last time I was this tired, I had been woken up in the middle of a field by a pack of dogs.  Justin and I spent the weekend in Chicago with his family and crazy friends.  During that time, I had a lot of "firsts."  First Cubs game (against the White Sox!), first ride in a Mustang, and first Teen Wolf experience.  Brad is a nice boy.  He's friends with J. and Joe, and he was wearing a shirt his mom made for him.  He has an awesome apartment in Wrigleyville and is altogether a good person.  Brad likes to bite into unopened beer cans, also known as "Teen Wolfing It."  Both times he did this, the beer exploded in his face.  Not really what he was going for.  The second time, he cut his lip.  It was one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  It was one of the best weekends we've had in a long time, except for the part where our plane home was two hours late.  I did get a chance to explore Midway, though, and ate a really really good brownie.  So it wasn't all for nothing.  And when I came home, my little Roo was beside himself with excitement.  I missed that little guy.   The Great CD Challenge  70.  Work Rock , a mix by Justin 71.  The Way We Are , Fleming and John 72.  You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown , Original Cast Recording 73.

      Doesn't it feel like the day before Christmas break?  It's always a little wild here on days before a vacation (even just a weekend and a Monday off).  I taught crochet last night.  Five girls showed up, ages 7-10.  When I was finished, I was ready for some hard drugs.  The two that were really good were also the two who whined the most.  I came home, ate some Crazy Bread and then passed out.   The Great CD Challenge  59.  Storm Front , Billy Joel 60.   All for You , Janet Jackson  61.  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  soundtrack 62.

      Let's take a vote.  Let's say you've had a really bad headache since you entered the glass conference room at 9 a.m.  You have three hours of work left.  THEN you're teaching five children and one mother how to crochet.  When do you take your last two Advil?  Because those suckers gotta last.  One of my coworkers has massive food poisoning (but she made it in a little while for our training - INsane) and I think my head is going to explode.  It's going to be a very long afternoon.

FARC CD vol. 3   After a long day of training and being trained, I made it home around 7:00 last night.  Justin and I were going to go to Target once he finished some stuff. I crawled into my bed to wait for him around 8:00, and when he woke me up at 8:30, I thought it was the next day.  My face was mashed with pillow, my chin was sticky with drool, but he still looked at me like I was the most beautiful girl in the world.  Sucker.

      "Out of control" would be a good way to describe my current yarn situation.  "Where the hell am I going to put this?" and "God love this part-time job" would also work.   I walked into the shop with two skeins of yarn yesterday, previously purchased and already starting to take shape.  I walked out with six more.  I didn't pay for those.  Jo-Ann (whom I love dearly) says, "Hey!  Let's make this!" and then I get some Point 5 and Lorna's Laces and a determination to teach myself scribble lace.  I also scored some Lamb's Pride (I'm sorry I keep calling you Lion Brand, Lamb's Pride.  That's just not nice) to make a hat for a fall class.  But therein lies the problem.  Since I started this job two months ago, my stash has increased at least 100%.  So tonight will be The Great Yarn Storage project.  Target has clear storage containers on sale, and I'm going to buy a few and see how that works.  I'm also having my carpet cleaned (for free!) next week, so it's time to start getting stuff off the floor.  If I could figure out how to put current projects in my sidebar, I would.  Any ideas?  But here's a list, in order of what needs to be finished first (note: I sadly already have all the yarn required for all of these): 1. Horrid turqoise tank top from Summer '04 VK, which will not decrease to eight shoulder strap stitches like it should.  I need eight, not 11! 2. Jeanne's bag. 3. Two crocheted ponchos out of Rowan Cotton Braid for Jo-Ann (shouldn't take long - I worked on it for about an hour last night and I'm almost done with the first of two pieces).   Rowan crochet patterns deserve a post of their own. 3.5. Novelty scarf for the store. 4. Mom's sweater. 5. Slip-a-stitch hat for class. 6. Bunny hat for class. 7. Klaralund. 8. Bottoms-up Bucket hat. 8.5. Scribble lace shawl thing. 9. Those socks I ripped out. 10. Gigi. 11. That light blue cabled sweater from Strick.  Agh!

      So I don't talk about work on here very much.  Not because I'm afraid I'll get fired, but because it's not that interesting.  But I've very proud of the boys downstairs for creating this, and proud to get to work on this campaign with them.  There's even a game where you get to eat democrats and republicans!   urlLink Candidate Zero's Blog   And I also must mention that I'm pretty sure CZ is on VH1's A to Z - not as CZ, but as himself, a comedian.  Unfortunately, VH1.com doesn't seem to thing that people need to know anything about the commentators on any of their shows.  Thanks a lot, jackasses.

      Davenport!  What the hell?  How can you let THREE banks be robbed in one day, no less a day when two presidential candidates are in town?  And how could you let it be the three most rinky dink places in town, including that little hole by Jo-Ann's (which sucks anyway - that store is just no good)?  And how could you let my arch nemesis MATT LAUER tell me about it?  Davenport, I think I hate you.  And Charlie Brooke, I think I hate you too.  What is going on with your head?  It looks very strange.  During this time of The Great CD Challenge, we have to consider the wants and needs of our listeners, mainly me.  And this listener has made an unprecedented decision.   I am going to listen to the Stellastarr CD all day BECAUSE I CAN.  And because I really like it.

      It turns out that I'm a total liar.  I didn't have an Excel class Thursday and Friday.  I never intended on visiting Abby this weekend.  Instead, my dad and I have been plotting a surprise birthday visit to Iowa for my mom.  I took the train home on Thursday, and I'm about to leave pretty soon.   It was a really good weekend filled with fart spray, shoe sales and a dog with a stinky ear.  I slept a lot and ate a lot of cake (Hy-Vee, I love you).  But I miss my boyfriend and my mouse (in that order), so it's time to go home.  Tomorrow I'll tell you about the near-rumble on the train here.  I'm hoping something even more exciting will happen on the way home, so sit tight.
