      well yesterday i went to the P@P picnic with laura and gem. I didn't get to really talking to other people but that's okay, i can get to know people on the 25 hour plane ride. perfect! Well for right now i don't know who i will be rooming with. probably allie and maybe casey....or not.  i feel rather tired to day for no reason. i mean i was up late but i don't usually sleep till 1:40!!  That is beyond late. Maybe i need more vitmins. dang it.....i hate taking excess pills.  UPDATE: on-you-know-who- he's been away for more than a week and hasn't called so....having my luck with guys...he probably i going to caomeback tha day i leave! joy!  And a side note, i am not totally over my feelings for ksch. so i rathe not mention him and stop me if i do. I don't want to see him, laugh at him..or have anymore fun with him.....it just hurts too much. AND WILL SOMEONE STOP PLAYING THAT SONG!!!!   well as for now over and out.

      hey im back from australia yo! jet lag is gone! yay! well hey it has been a week but ya know.  Last night i had a dream that i was living in the woods in a clearing in a yellow house. I was inside and i was taking care of a baby...my baby! But the strange thing is it had no face! Then my husband came in and greeted me, he didn't have a face either! But i was happily married and didn't want to leave the dream. I felt safe and happy.  I know exactly why i had the dream too. lately lambchop was talking about her sister picking out a wedding dress and how all of the at was far away from her. but that got me thinking...exactly how far away is it from us.....time is short.....hopefuly i won't worry about it though. But i don't know about you...but im eager to find out who i am goignto marry.  im in love with the thought. that could be dangerous though. i love love. romantics are so sappy. and i am sappy.

      "You don't know them,   don't tell me you hate them  ! just shut the HELL UP!!!!!!!!!!!! get to know people better before you judge. sorry for the vent of anger." -anyanomus  I have come to the realization that i get along better with  guys  than with  girls . They are a bit simpler....no im not trying to dis anyone. Im a tom-bay and i like it.  a flirty, happy, giggly tomboy . having female friends is great! i can relate to them and we can give each other advise. But it sometimes becomes to Complicated. They can hurt my feelings and make me feel rotten with out knowing it. And im sick  and  tired  of it!!!! Do i need  new  friends? Should i  move ? would a  fresh start  be good?

      well i am very happy for the rest of you who sang....you guys probably did better than you all thought. GOOD JOB EVERYONE!  Well anyway i had a lovely day at school! Well mostly.....first we had to go to advisory which was drop dead boring. That presentation may have gotten distinguished but if they had graded that on keeping the interest of the audience...it would have gotten a D. And yes i have right to say this because i love baking and she made it so boring. But other than that she really did a great job. Them comes chem.....normal. Them Espanol! a test! oh joy!.....i think i did well. In brit lit. i wass the first to get done on the Beowulf test...full essay and all in about twenty minutes! wow that's amazing....even for me the one with the journalist genes. lol then lunch....it was MaRe-tastic! :D  don't you make fun o me laura ok........*gives evil eye* And again with the singing. Choir class. i got called back! yey! i thought he might just say oh screw it i got enough. tomr i audition again for soprano and alto. yipee my chance to be alto again. (last time i was alto i was in 6th grade.) fun fun fun! i think im much stronger and louder as an alto anyway........well you would have to hear me in the foyer to know that. i can't wait! what shall i wear? must dress to impress..... oh it's only tesh....he don't care.  Oh and i want emailed website feed back people!!!!! lataz!

      Eish.  To be honest, I didn't do spectacular either, especially because I have no falcetto--  can't hit a G...that'd be the high note on "red glare" and "free."  But I didnt go to auditions to make it, I jsut went to see what Teschner had to say, though I could've done better than what I did last night  The National Anthem is a good song for testing... because it's impossible .  On another note, eek was very good.  He sounded like a Brit ^_^.

      The 3vil (evil)--- that is Christoph cometh.  Time to  SABOTAGE!   Anyway.  You, gem, and lamb chop made up some name for your trio when you were at gem's house..."the something of intelligence," and  it was SCARY! .  And I think you spread some of your insanity over to me.  But that shouldn't matter much as I am already insane.

      eye of the tiger tooth of the lion if you mess with me  i'll send you home cryin'!                                    or myself.  i am acting way different than ever these days. I think i have matured a bit more. No procrastination? No whining? Not caring if parents hangin around me? weird.  But then again i do have the tendency to get pretty wild lately. Some of you may have noticed this. Maybe it is that im too sure of myself. I have never felt this way before! Parents of my back! feelin more free? wow. i think i might go crazy.  well anyway on friday i went to gem's house along with laura and we did soem eatin, lookin thru gem's past, and watchin movies. Did i mention torchering people on line? lol! no one will IM gem anymore! *wink* jk But when we were looking through gem's things, i felt some sort  of extreme sadness come back....it got me depressed. no one cares. does anything matter? im mean come on.....i have friends anda soon as we all go tot college.....i know we won't have time for each other. Is it even worth it to go through all this? i mean...teenage years......who needs them.  well iother than that i have nothing much else to say except....i feel that my life is getting rather distant form some friends. And i hate it that some of my best friends hate some of the others friends i know. You don't know them, don't tell me you, hate them just shut the HELL UP!!!!!!!!!!!! get to know people better before you judge. sorry for the vent of anger.   I dispise sunday.

      well monday is gone.....yay!!!  i am content so far this week. Nothing bad has happened for a while it makes me happier. grades are stable....my life is mostly stable....my parents aren't bugging me too much. I changed y room around...just for the thrill of a big change. But i also forgot that we had to change the clocks back...that totally screwed me up. now im tired at the weirdest times....odd.....no no not hibernation yet..im to BUSY!! Did you know that humans supposedly used to hibernate. Thats why we tend to be lazy tired and hungry for extra food around holiday time and winter. Interesting.  Im shy. Lately i have just been that way. Only for one reason i know but you guys know me...im a motor mouth!!!!

      wow the week has gone by so so.....slow as gloppy katchup plopping out a bottle.....yummy,  lots o stuff. hmmm. I sprained my ankle on sunday...it still hurts. i used crutches til wed..they hurt me bad. i caught up in all the classes i missed on mon...now i have tests in all of them tomr. wish me luck. but all that will be all well and good over time.   Lately i have been having a lot of weird dreams and daydreams. Involving what i wish i did in past events or stuff that hasn't happened yet but i feel will. I also have had dreams where all my friends have died. It's all kind of eiree. Not only cause the subjects, but cause i don't usually get dreams. Its forgien to me. These dreams make me go in to a daze or fall asleep at odd times and odd places. It happened in spanish, study hall and the bus home today. Its kinda freakin me out. I think im going to start a online dream log. You guys can submit some too....im going to make a page....then i we can think about them and anaylize them.  Or just get a good laugh. Well lata.....or catch ya on da flip.

       Roman Catholicism   Well yes, after this past summer i now believe in God again. Im proud. But my problem now is...why haven't i ever felt a i had a relationship with Him? because i realize i was never really worked with and introduced to the wonder that is Him. Sure as a kid i got told stories and was always told "if you are good god will love you and take youi to heaven", but really the thing i didn't get was. Who is this God dude anyway? ya know? I know He has done things for the family.....we live here in bucks county, i have a good roof over my head, and i have friends and family who love me. Its no that i want more. It's that i want to thank him and do right...but don't know how. The fact is ......i was always a shy one....it may not seem like it now but i am really really shy. And I am shy of God. that is why im scared. i mean...i used to fear my family! that's how shy i used to be. I don't believe that The Catholic faith is accurate.i mean..it too stiff and structured. Surely over years the bible has been wrongly interpereted by men trying to seek power by saying....."oh but GOD said so! it has to be this way!" All i want is to feel comfortable enough with God so i don't feel like a silly fool praying cause i don't know him well. All i want is the Christian Truth. Amen to that sistah!

       HOMECOMING   It was awesome!!! I had some serious being myself fun last night! I hung out wwith Lambchop, gem, christoph, annie may, and of course quietone *mydate* or you could call him Renz. He was so much more outgoing than he is in class. He was fun and a gentleman. i wouldn't mind going out with him again! I danced with him alot and hung with the crew. they were thinking bout kicking the guy w/ the top hat and they kicked around someone's corsage or summat. poor melissa was date less so i let her dance with my date on what i wasn;t aware was the last dance. but him hangin at my house, impressing me at piano, hugging me, and me kissing him on the cheek, definetly fixed that up nicely. i had a awesome time  Corsage.......Renz....smell good

      I would like to fly... To gracefully dance upon the clouds, To play with the birds, And to sing with the Angels, their joy.  I would like to promote harmony among my fellow countrymen. The entire world would smile. I would like to end the pain To seize anger with a firm grasp. To help those who need it most.  But then i hear as i walk through the meadow, A loud crack, the whip! Pulling me down, The strings tighten around my body Restricting every move and thought i make.  Reality's eyes stare me dead in the face!  And then i cave.  How am i to fly among the clouds? I have not a cape. But as the dark grows, a thought passes my mind, If the world would reach out and help It may just awaken to see the day. When we shall work to be....  Our own SAVIOR.

       Sunday Sunday Sundae   Well well well....this has been a great weekend. This friday i basically relaxed. On Saturday I went out to the Harry Potter Movie with my best friends. It was truely a cool movie. The actors were great....the action was great too.....and the best parts were the funny parts....like when Ron was freaking out at the spiders and his voice was cracking.....that was great! Oh and the slugs! Purely gross! LOL Well then if that was such a great time then. What about Sunday Almond? eh eh? Well on sunday i ... went out... on a date... with Renz!! WooooHOOOO! Fun time! I saw HP again! Just as good as the first time! And yes we spent time together alone...talked about music....books...etc We have quite a few things in common.  It was really great....but i do believe he was very nervous....he was acting shier (is that a word?) than usual! And so was i...lol. I most defineatly had a great weekend! can't wait to see everyone at school! CHAIO!

       Well slap a tiger and call me a fool!!!!   i kinda like school.  Lately anyway....im doing my best and trying harder. I wish i had the time to take an AP class....perhaps they will let me next year? or i will just do honors. i want to see how well i can do if i feel happy. And so far this has been the best year of my highschool career! weird aint it? I LOVE MONDAY! MONDAY is what u MAKE IT!  You make the NIGHT DIM, you make the SUN SHINE  Do you have a secret held tight? silent in the begining of our time like a cold winter night introverted like a mime.  Deep eyes in which eternity stops For you alone keep the sand flowing Your dark figure haunts the clock A pure evil ever slowly growing  But your smile fills my heart You radiate to me an endless joy Your inner sweetness sings, A Lark! Making me happy to be there, but coy.  My lone of your darkness and light shant fade A love that will sink with me to the grave.

      Ya know what....Mondays are anly as bad as you make them to be. i had a swell monday. JCC  Well today is Tuesday and i have died.............. not really, but it feels like it....i didn't laugh much today. I think im getting sick. Yes i estimate a good day on how many times i smiled and laughed.....this has made me realize that some people in the world have terrible lives and that my life is just not bad at all. I have to deal with problems but im learning. A good life is one which you happen to smile and laugh a lot through. A bad life is one that brings no joy to your face. And that, today my friends, is my words of wisdom.   Sickness.....another sign of a good life is that you are happy reminiscing about it. Right now im thinking of the joys of soup. Does anyone remember Chicken and Stars? Vegetable Alpahabet? mmmmm....good times, good times. I do.

       I know you have heard it before in every other blog lately but....   BEING A TEEN SUCKS!! What the heck is the matter with the people who enjoyed this time...personally i want it to be over. Well maybe not the age thing exactly.....but i want the torchures of youth and the things that happen to rip the heart apart to stop! is there no end to this cycle? Will our heads all swim like this forever? Will it get any better? We all need to   talk   about our lives...whats  happening ...what makes us feel  bad why we are  pulling  away!   It might get better.  Give in to the side that wants to talk about it. We might just be making  ourselves  crazy.  Out for a drive now.....really.

      I gotta get me some of that. Well on Thursday i want and saw TTT again...it was cool....i was out wiht different people than usual and it feels good. Not that anything is wrong with my tight crew. I sometimes with i had other choices ya know! DO something spontaneous and different from the norm, and that's what i did. When i get to school i am going to change. My new thing is to become friends with as many as i can. I need to experience more people and get out there. I feel i need more air. I am going to broaden my horizons.   I have taken a start by hangin with others this week. I feel a hint of modivation.   I am so going to be a traveler when i grow up. I want to explore! Get out of this confinement they call a house and see the world! See if i can make a difference.....share international opinion...be a part of many communities. I need to make a trip across the US first though.   Yes that will be my first goal. ...Better start saving....

      Again i have realized....i never see my friends out in town. And another thing i always notice...people in different cliques in school are some times much nicer out side of school.  Today we went out with the goal of finding a Christmas tree. Don't laugh...we know it was rather late..but we suceeded. Of course we had trouble at first, actually the first problem had nothing to do with trees! We were delayed from leaving the house becasue we discovered the nest of a mouse in the garage and a lot of corn pieces with spread all over the place as dad knocked the nest over. We had to clean that up. Then, after an hour of cleaning and setting traps, we were off! In the dark.  Obviously we could barely see the trees, so we had to make due. We went to several tree places trying to find a tree that wasn't messed up or dry. After much toil, we finally arrived at Bountiful Acres. Yeah all kinds of people i know but am not friends with work there. There was Katie Tiglhman...i think that is spelled wrong....and guess what.. Dave Dillon! Fun stuff. Of couse Katie didn't talk to me at all. But i was suprised when Dave did. Dave knew my bro from Spanish las year and i know him from spanish in 8th grade. We picked several trees we didn''t like and he had a bit of a hard time lugging them out but he was really nice an professional about it. He helpped us get a really nice tree for 25 bucks and my mom and i had a really nice conversation with him. It was interesting.  He was way different than he was in 8th grade and after his accident...you could actually feel a sense of his appreciation of going throught what he had go through. He also talked about admiring my bro...which is a first from anyone i ever talked to. It made me feel all warm an fuzzy.   So in the end we got a tree, i revisited somone i haven't really recognized as a friendly person in a few years and i got a warm christmas feeling.   Happy christmas everyone.

      Ive been really tired lately..kinda zoombie-ish. And im not sure why....and i keep blacking out....i tell my parents and of course they don't hear me. The only time they really hear me and do something is when i give them attitude. But i only do it cause at that precise moment i hate their guts. I mean gosh....i once made a promise to myself that when my mom was lying on here death bed i would curse her off first before saying goodbye....but i thought better of it. heh. I am punished for a week for not wearing my winter jacket on monday...and then giving them attitude about it when the punished me. I have been angry ever since. I sometimes which i had my friends parents...ones a bit less controlling. But they aren't always this mean and im not always this angry...its just only when im craving chocolate and am a bit peeved i think.....right girls *wink wink*.  Its supposed to snow tonight!!! Lots of people hope we have off tomr but personally i would rather go to school than get in more trouble with the folks (see above). I love snow...but not the cold. It should snow in summer. yay. Perfection.    I think my anime drawing is getting better.....i still messup on the forehead and lips tho....they are suprisingly hard to do. I have to originalize my drawing technique it think...time for a bit of artistic experimentation. I will try to draw the friends yup..that means you.lol   wellgtg time to hw....cya

      Today was an okay day. I learned somemore as usual and that is always good. I discovered i can type without looking at the keys. I hit a record of constantly laughing in study hall for 11 minutes.....i couldn't breathe......thanks to Renz and Mapa. I survived the Spanish assesment. I got a migrane. Chrstoph's comic books got lifted...but Iam helpping him with that. I read some more 1984  You shall now all call me wonder woman! (im already called "super woman" by Renz cause i can crush cans with my hands and he can't :P)  lol, until next episode, this is almond signing off.

      yes the mood changes form day to day......  I feel awesome!!! I woke up this morning thinking i would have no energy to party or do anything at all! I cleaned my room for an hour, went to pick up the present for Christoph and then i went! It was sweetness. First we waited for all to arrive. We listened to some cool music...(geez Christoph has alot of music on his comp)....then we played a bit of DDR. It was fun...and i was determined to get an A. I got D's and E's Yay! and a few failures  but geez they were hard. We played alot after the movie! and i am so going to buy it...it was great exersize.  Yes, we saw Catch Me If You Can. I loved it. A great story, amazing actually. I can't believe it, the boy runs away and how does he teach himself to do all he did? He must have been a really intelligent guy and im glad the ending turned out all right. It made me sad to see all he did accomplsh nothing familywise. But, the fact that his life did turn around for the better made me warm and fuzzy. I don't know what i would do in the situation...i would have given up way ahead of when he did. Leonardo Dicaprio defineatly redeemed himself after Titanic with this film....well....at least with me.  And the other cool stuff we did was look aroung the house, tour Christoph's living space, said "awwwwww, he's so adorable" to all his pictures of the younger years, played Hungry Hungry Hippos, played a guessing game thing that i can't remember the name of, laughed listened to more music, ate, ate cake, and poked the squishy thing.  All together this makes an excellent day in my book! Chistoph rawks! ........ahem...and now i am obcessed with DDR. Yay!  later! ~Almond.

      I am in such a good mood today!  I went out for a job test and interview this morning at 10 a.m. with PNC Bank for a Teller position. The application was simple enough, unfortunately the only work experience I had was a Library Aide at school so I just put that. Worked well enough. Then we had to pass a test once the application was reviewed. This test was long and boring but it enlightened me to the skills I would need for this job. It's actually not bad at all. Amoung myself was other people trying to get a job. A thiry year old man, a 28 year old woman, a 21 year old woman, and a 17 yr old guy. Well we took the test and then it was graded.   When the scorer got back she asked Justin (17 yr old guy) and I to please step out of the room. At that moment I fumbled to get up and walked out of the door with a raging heartbeat, I sat on a chair out side and waited alot with my nervous partner. Minutes had passed since the door had closed, my conditon not improving, finally, the door opened and out trailed all the adults walking straight for the door with their heads tilted down. Oh crap if they didn't make it I certainly didn't I thought. But then, You two were the only ones who passed the test, do you have a few minutes to get interviewed? When those words dropped from her lips on to my ear drums i was relieved and said YES! OF COURSE! Then the interview and rest was a breeze. Unfortunately they need Full time tellers right now, I said that i could be full time over the summer if that would help. They said they might, and the defineatly will give me a call (lady had to say that about 100 times)and once the bank starts switching to the new system. After that i was given her card, and 2 phone numbers to reach her if I can work on the Temple campus if I am willing to live there! JOY! Opportunity all over the place!   And so there we go. In the mean while i will be searching for another job, but if they call and I am available, that is FINE for me. I like working with money anyway.  OH, I also got my first driving lesson and my dad said not bad at all. I am an automatic expert at parking! And i can drive in a straight line, and no lurching! yay great start!   Okay gotta sleep for the Philly Trip Tomr! ttyl byeee!

      I am in a lot of emotional pain right now. I don't know if I am being haunted in my dreams, or if its just the overwhelming longing of my subconcious. All I can think to do is pray right now. So far it hasn't done much good, but it has stopped my crying.   And everytime I cry, I start to pray. I pray for everything. And when I do, I pray HARD.   I get kinda vicious when I pray when I am sad or angry, but I try to apologize. It's like trying to play basketball and you can't make a shot because a huge person is in front of you and you get REALLY frustrated and all you can do it work harder at it!  Got Prayer?  I got game...I mean Prayer.

      You know sometimes I sit and think and I say to myself. Almond, you are so boring. You get up in the morning, get ready, go to school, come home, do homework, yada yada, then go to bed. It's a cycle we have all gone through in our lives. In my case though, I don't remember huge chunks of my day. Even my life! It all runs together like one of my watercolors in which I accidently used too much water.   And then I get to thinking. What if I was a star? This is kinda odd actually because I am rather shy when it comes to people I don't know. When I was small in fact, I didn't talk. I had to make friends with the kindergarden teacher before making friends with the kids. I have grown since then, I can be wild and wacky, yes. But when I have to go and do it in front of people I clam up. If you haven't noticed, when I am shy I don't speak and I fake boredom.   On the otherside I want to be known. Sorta like JLo with out the marriage problems. I want to grow up and hear people say, "Hey there goes that big star Almond! But she seems really down to earth and friendly! She's not typical Hollywood."  I jus want to be seen or to see. A lot actually. That is why I want to be an actress. Yet I have very little training and I am afraid of failure or rejection if I am not up to par like the other college kids.   So many stars had a natural talent at my age. I haven't even scored a part in a play. Sucks alot. Yet I am happy. I have confidence (now *lol*)I bet I could suceed in my dream.   Or if it doesn't work out, I have MANY dreams to try. :-)

      "Vladimir gave a hearty laugh. "Chandler gave this little tyke to me as an early Christmas present!" he boomed merrily as he gave the Puffskein one last pat before letting it on the floor. Narcissa’s silver eyes followed it with subtle disgust. "Good man, Chandler, never forgets to give me presents! I’ve always wanted one, mind you, other than having the complete set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer paperback series," he continued. Ginny found herself laughing upon noting the hinting tone in his voice."  -The Serpent's Bride (Rated-R)  And Farhod was watching Buffy today, when I went over to his house! Lol I love him, he watches shows like Buffy, Friends, and Simpson. Makes me so happy.  He leaves tomr, so tonight was our last evening together. He signed my yearbook and wouldn't let me read it until later, so cute that way. I read it and cried. Simple but the ending was sweet.  We will write, we promised each other.

      Perhaps I was already there. I don't know.   The sun looks so beautiful. I have thought many many times to just run. Run until I am there. every thing is crazy.  My feelings are discombobulated (sp?).  I think I am going insane. I wake every morning and think of the same thing. I see the same thing. I can't stop thinking about it every day. Every thing reminds me of him.  Currently I can't breathe, I slowly slip in to memories and I get glazed over.   Wow the sunset is so beautiful.  Pink...i gotta go outside.  I need to see it. I needd to see the moon. You can't tear me away from it.

       urlLink    Old meets New&nbsp; urlLink     Yes the Philadelphia trip yesterday was a sucess! I was hyper from a Starbucks Frappiccino and as excited as a small child in a Disney World!   The train trip was grand, I goofed off with Gem, ate candy, read my "Sayings of Muhammad" book noting some of the...interesting things he had to say about hygenie and what.  We hit the Liberty Bell first, and then left our mark on Independence Hall. Then we took a stroll pass the horse carriages to Washington Square. Here we saw the Tomb of the unknown soilder and the eternal flame (which was out). Then onward to the bench where we had "Pigeon Time" with Gem's cam.  Then we were hungry so we walked to the Gallery and ate chicken. Following lunch was a brisk walk to The Franklin Institute! Go there or be square. Here we had some interesting ventures, including spining around in the lobby, tap dancing up and down Benny Frank's stairs, and staring at the pendulum. Of course we look at all the cool science exhibits, the planetarium, and an IMAX show "Mysteries of Egypt". Now I want to learn about Egypt and buy Egyptian stuffs. I tried in the FI store but to no avail, no one was available to tell me the price of the hot egyptian earrings in the window. I was sad and didn't want to leave but we did.   And so the rest goes as follows, Suburban Station > Food Court> Train> Gem house > My house > passout.  Overall a GRANDTASTIC day.

Not bad, not exciting.  Just... basic.  Yes, it has been one of those days where everything goes smooth as chocolate syrup. It can kinda makes you sick. But, all day I have had the urge to just curl up somewhere and be held. Simple enough I guess, yet there is no one to do that. It's weird sitting here closing my eyes and waiting for arms to wrap around me. Am I the only one who gets that?   And for some odd ball reason I hunger for fruit snacks and spinach chicken salad.

      As you probably already assumed, I don't think I will be having a birthday party this week. Maybe not at all. The deck was late being made so there isn't enough time for it to be finished and have a party before some people leave for college. Plus I am broke, anyway.  I don't know what to do. Anyone have any bright ideas?  This sucks. Quite a lot.

         You have a free soul! As all the souls go, yours is the most free-spirited and adventurous. You like camping, hiking, or interaction with other people. Your a social butterfly, but not because of your style, but because of your willingness to communicate with everyone. You probably have close friends who can rely on you because you always seem to know whats going on in the world. You love music and are free-spirited and someone fun to be around. A born leader and great explorer-dont ever change-the world needs more people like you.     urlLink  What Kind of SOUL do you posses?
