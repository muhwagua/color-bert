      I'm now finding myself at my "mid-college" crisis, but am thankful that the end of the semester is here.  I'm finding that making life decisions isn't really my forte, and would rather hop aimlessly from opportunity to opportunity, whenever it knocks, but I know that I'll probably change my mind by tomorrow...

       Love sucks...and so do girls.    "EVE WAS FRAMED."   I recall the very first time I saw this bumper sticker on my way to campus one day, and I thought to myself,  "Gee, I wonder if this girl ever gets tired watching all the people she sees in her rearview mirror roll their eyes?"   Eve, my friends, was not framed, she swallowed the apple whole. Core. Seeds. Stem. And, I bet she loved it.  She probably devoured the apple faster than that finicky freak of a monkey-boy Chris Kattan plays on Saturday Night Live.  I recently received in an e-mail this bit of information:   Anyway, I also wanted to apologize for being so distant with you recently. I  did suddenly start dating someone more seriously lately, and it is such that I  probably won't be dating anyone else for the time being. So, I suppose I was  just being unnecessarily awkward in bringing it up. Sorry about that. I don't  even know whether you care all that much. However, I hope that it won't prevent  us from contunuing to get to know each other because I think you're a cool cat,  John. I really do...in fact, I have found very few people in my life  that I can identify with as well as with you, spiritually and otherwise. That's  important to me. So, in hopes of not losing that, I'm very glad that we've  arranged something where we can see each other regularly and not once in a blue  moon. You dig?       Well, I don't dig...and I did care.  I guess I'll survive.

      So I've been relatively stagnant for over a month.  Happy Holidays!  At least I hope they were happy.  Here I am, back at school, which seems to be my favorite place to be these days. Let's see how this semester goes.  The education system in Arizona seems to be in a bit of confusion and turmoil.  I'm re-running an article written by Amy Silverman of the Phoenix  New Times  to shed a little light on some other things happening here, as well as my response to Amy, which was published in the New Times a couple of issues later...   Raising Arizona State    ASU honchos enjoy pay increases of nearly a quarter of a million dollars  BY AMY SILVERMAN   At a time when officials were leaving faculty positions vacant, firing secretaries and talking about raising tuition as much as $1,000 per student, top executives at Arizona State University were getting hefty raises. And President Michael Crow was getting ready to redecorate his office.   Between September and October of last year, nine ASU honchos were given salary increases totaling close to a quarter of a million dollars.   The raises were part of a reorganization of university senior administration, says ASU spokeswoman Nancy Neff. She says the university surveyed comparable positions nationally and adjusted salaries to the midrange of the findings.   Too bad ASU isn't making the same comparisons -- and adjustments -- when it comes to faculty. In fact, according to figures provided by Neff, ASU is rapidly losing tenured professors, and the student-to-faculty ratio is increasing.   The university was well aware of this in September, when it started handing out executive raises. This past summer, ASU eliminated about 75 faculty positions -- twice as many as the previous year -- in response to budget cuts. About 40 clerical positions also were axed.   But in December, the cuts grew much deeper when the Legislature met for a much-anticipated special session to address a huge shortfall. A document provided by Neff details more than $16 million in midyear budget cuts designed to satisfy the Legislature's demands.   Research facilities and libraries will be hit hard. There is no mention of eliminating those executive raises -- or eliminating any executive positions -- but instead the memo details further faculty cuts. In the 1990s, ASU's student-to-faculty ratio climbed from 26:1 to 31:1. As enrollment climbs, the number of faculty hired will drop, increasing that ratio. The December round of cuts, for example, will force vacancies in 28 faculty positions.   ASU officials voice concern in the memo, explaining that the use of part-time and temporary faculty has increased alarmingly, and that students are complaining that they can't schedule classes at convenient times, which could increase the time it takes them to graduate. The memo also says that under the present budget cuts, the ratio of students to academic advisers will increase to 500:1.   Neff did not say whether the executive salary increases were in reaction to Crow's hiring salary last summer, which at $390,000 forced the Arizona Board of Regents to increase the salaries of presidents at Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona. (UofA President Peter Likens gave back his raise.) In a few short months, Crow -- who came to ASU last summer from Columbia University -- has already earned a reputation for flashy behavior.   Were it not for bad publicity in ASU's newspaper, Crow's office would now be in the middle of a $200,000 renovation. In December, the  State Press  broke the news that the university was planning $3.6 million in renovations during the winter break, including redecorating Crow's office. The school delayed the projects shortly after the  State Press  story appeared.   In an editorial following the decision, the paper commented that Crow's office is so outdated "that there are pinholes in the walls from previous picture frame hangings and tape covering some parts of the carpet." The air conditioning doesn't blow very well.   "Our response," says the  State Press : "Live with it."   "The proposed tuition hike, supposedly needed because of the state's under funding of public universities, will take an additional $500 to $1,000 out of the pockets of students who already can't afford new air conditioning for their used cars. Many will be forced to drop out of school altogether."   The student paper apparently hadn't caught wind of the executive promotions and raises, which included:   • Milton Glick   From: Senior Vice President and Provost, at $206,450   To: Executive Vice President and Provost, at $250,000   • Mernoy Harrison   From: Vice President-Administrative Services, at $157,700   To: Executive Vice President-Administration and Finance, at $200,000   • Jonathan Fink   From: Vice Provost for Research, at $146,200   To: Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs, at $195,000   • Christine Wilkinson   From: Vice President for Student Affairs, at $154,650   To: Senior Vice President and Secretary to the University, at $190,000   • Charles Backus, Vice President and Provost-ASU East Campus   From: $153,450   To: $163,000   (This is a retention raise, to keep him from retiring for another year.)   • James Rund   From: Associate Vice President/Dean-Student Affairs, at $132,156   To: Interim Vice President for Student Affairs, at $154,650   • Ray Jensen   From: Executive Director-Purchasing and Business Services, at $112,049   To: Associate Vice President-Administration, at $122,000   • Gerald Snyder   From: Comptroller/Treasurer, at $109,578   To: Associate Vice President-Finance and Treasurer, at $119,000   • John Riley   From: Associate Director-Purchasing, at $80,230   To: Director of Purchasing and Business Services, at $90,000   Neff says many of these raises came with increased responsibilities, eliminating, for example, the need to create a position for a chief financial officer for economic development.   Now that's a job that, perhaps, ASU could really use, given the current scramble to make even more cuts, beginning later this month.  phoenixnewtimes.com | originally published: January 2, 2003     And here's my response:   To hull and back : Darn, you're good. But don't you mean "Razing" Arizona State? You captured some good points, and it's something everyone here needed to hear. Although I can attest to the fact that many of the people whose salaries you mentioned do a magnificent job, it seems that others have taken note of the way ASU wants to ring in the new year: shifting the burden from the taxpayers to the students.  In an October letter to Randall Gnant and Jim Wiers, the outgoing Speaker of the House and president of the Senate, respectively, Governor Jane Hull said she didn't want to cut the university's budget more than 5 percent because she didn't want it to directly affect the students. Wake up and smell the propane, Jane! It's affecting us! Now we'll have to pay an extra $1,000 in tuition. At the same time, Hull said she was only cutting the Arizona Board of Regents' budget by 2 percent because she still wanted to make Arizona's schools appealing. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.   Now our beloved Dr. Crow, ASU's so-called savior, is at the mast of this great ship bound for who knows where. This great ship, coincidentally losing its "Hull," is not receiving much support from the state. The "Changing Directions" initiative headlines its proposal by saying it wants to "increase the affordability of higher education" and "improve the quality of the educational experience." Oh, really?   So make us pay for Dr. Crow's new office, let us help pay for the executives' raises, let us pay $1,000 more a year, quit watering the grass and let's see where ASU's retention rate goes. I threw "quit watering the grass" in there for comedic relief, but that's true, too.   How ironic that we're Sun Devils? The sun has obviously quit shining on us, and we're in a hell of a situation.

      Dating is a lot like bowling:  you can do it in twos or fours or more, you're supposed to keep score, most people look kind of funny doing it, you get to play the angles and grip a lot of balls, and if you dont pay attention, You'll end up in the gutter.  If you take your dating anymore seriously than your bowling you run the risk of becoming a professional dater or worse yet, ending up in a friday night dating league for the rest of your life.   -The Bad Girl's Guide to Getting What You Want

      All right...when I said my faith was renewed, I did not mean that specific girl. In fact, I think she's just an oblivious temptress to me, but also a wonderful, good, amazing friend.  I was talking about her the other night to another female friend, and the friend threw a curveball question at me:   Do you think people can get physical with other people they're not interested in?    OF COURSE THEY CAN .  Notwithstanding the fact that I think it's deplorable and morally wrong, it happens continually. It's a practice that requires us to excercise the most lascivious muscles in our body, and desecrates any pure emotion one person may have to another. No passion, just pleasure.  As Will Ferrell says playing Harry Caray:   Don't jerk me around...it's a simple question...a baby could answer it.

      Just 12 hours ago I posted something, and here I am again doing the same thing.  But then again, I had no idea 12 hours ago that Tommy D would ask me to go to the Edwin McCain/Sister Hazel concert at Celebrity Theatre.  I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised, and we definitely had a good time.  We did concur, however, that Edwin McCain was probably not extremely suited for two blokes like us, but Sister Hazel totally rocked and kept it loud enough and fast-paced for us, especially with their awesome extended version of Happy.  It was so long that Ken and the rest of the band left the stage while their lead guitarist kept going, and then they came back to finish the song.  It was awesome...thanks, Tommy D!!

        Bend It Like Beckham : Brit humor meets Bollywood...   Roughly a year ago, I began seeing advertisements for this movie, and was intrigued from the get go.  I more or less forgot about it until recently when asked to go see the film.  It was a hit in most other English speaking countries, but only now are we privileged enough to see this little comic masterpiece.   I loved it.   Although very simple at times, it mixes two cultures that most Americans don't know about, but may be able to identify with.  The story line isn't too unfamiliar.  Girl has talent.  Girl gets discovered.  Girl makes makes the team, makes a lot of friends, and falls in love along the way.  Girl tries to hide talent from ultra-traditional family, but in the end, all works out.  It is most definitely a "feel-good" movie with an excellent, attractive cast that makes you feel as you could go to their little corner of England and be part of their crowd too.  I don't want to divulge too much (and I don't think I have), but I would highly reccomend brushing up on your anglicisms, and going to see  Bend It Like Beckham .  P.S. If you know your British actors and actresses, you'll be pleasantly surprised to watch Juliet Stevenson, formerly of the Royal Shakespeare Company, steal several scenes as the kooky Brit mother of Jules.

       GOODBYE:  The Most Awful Word In The English Language    Although necessary in some cases, goodbye just doesn't carry the simplicity as the Italian " ciao " or Hawaiian " aloha ".  For me, saying "goodbye" has been one of the most difficult and arduous tasks I have ever undertaken, even if I know that I might encounter the person once again.  Such is the case for me recently.  I have a friend who is leaving town, more than likely, for good.  She's been an integral part of my life for the better part of a year, and I'm truly torn to see her go.  She's been there for me, probably when she least expected it, and has managed to keep me in good spirits despite my roller coaster-like life. I can truly say that I have never met anyone quite like her.  That is not to diminish the importance of any of my other friends.  My friends are my family...it's all the same.  But this friend is in a category all her own.  I've made a promise to myself that it's not goodbye.  The distance between us has only been lengthened.  I love her, I'll miss her, and I'll see her again.  So, it looks like "goodbye" got off the hook again.   SONG OF THE DAY :  Don't Know Why  - Norah Jones

       3.81   OK, I'm satisfied for the semester.  Overall, I think it turned out pretty well.  I have a 4.0 in all of my Italian classes, which was enough to get me an application waiver to Stanford, provided I apply to their Italian Master's program.  I don't really know what I would do with a MA in Italian, but hey...at least I could say I went to Stanford.  As for my major GPA, it dropped from a 3.40 to a 3.33 because of the B in my Advanced PR Techniques class.  The more classes I take in my major, the more I realize how much I'm starting not to like it.  I suppose I can either usurp the last year of scholarship money and change majors, or I can graduate next May and get the hell out of Arizona and go to grad school.  Economy sucks, might as well stay in school.  Well, some more plans have unfolded for the summer. I'll be ready to start summer school here shortly.  The first term will be Mass Communication Law and Introductory Albanian I.  I'm still contemplating the second term.  I'll go to Malibu and check out Pepperdine in a few weeks.  I'm really diggin' their School of Public Policy.  In August, I'm going out on my little tour of schools in the New England area.  I want to look at Emerson College in Boston.  A friend of mine wants to see Harvard, and we'll probably meander down to New Jersey and see Princeton. Plus, while we're in Boston, we might check out this Italian festival going on at the same time.  My Aunt Desiree (a Bostonian herself) informed me of it.  Ok...boring entry, I know.  But if you go listen to "Come On Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners a few times, I'm sure you'll forget the whole ordeal.

       SCHOOL IS OUT FOR THE FREAKIN' SUMMER   Ahhh.  It's a nice feeling.  No more finals. No more late night Thursday classes. No more unorganized teachers. No more bosses jumping down your throat like my mother usually does because friends are coming to say "hi" to me at work.  It's a nice feeling.  I love the summer because of the awesome relief of stress that I experience (until summer school starts in June, that is).  I love summer movies.  I'm a little late on seeing the new X-Men movie, but no one asked me to go, so I guess I'll just go see it alone.  I'm disappointed in myself for that...a movie with Famke Janssen, and I didn't see it immediately!!  What am I thinking? I would've taken a date, but dating is overrated (I'll eat my words someday, I'm sure).  Even Famke thinks dating is dumb:   “I’ve never dated. I’ve always just had boyfriends. And I guess I’m pretty lucky because, from what I understand, dating sucks. Although it seems like it’s pretty good for stories. Sometimes I think people date just so they can have a good story to tell about the loser they went out with once.”    Gee, Famke, I'm glad you're giving guys like me a little hope.  There goes summer dating.  Summer kind of sucks because all of my friends are gone, and I usually have to think of creative ways of entertaining myself.  I think I do a good job of it, though.  A prime example would be during Cinco de Mayo, or as I like to call it, "Mexican St. Patrick's Day"...you know, they're both meaningful days, it's just that no one knows the meaning so everyone just ends up drinking a lot. Alas, I digress.  Anyway, while my amigos were out getting hammered, I had to study for a big test.  But, as usual, I got bored, so I decided to liven up things a bit.  I cranked up some Mariachi music (yes, we own some) and ate spoonfuls of pico de gallo and margarita salt to keep me awake. Grade A self-entertainment, let me tell ya.  So, is there a moral to the story, you ask? Not really.  Those of you who know me will understand why...I just don't make sense.  But hey, I smile a lot when I'm happy, so there's a least one legitimate correlation for you.  Summer is here, so let's enjoy it to the fullest.  All of the travelers will have a splendid time - Elizabeth F. in London, Matt S.and Celina in Paris, Matt H. in Italy (now that one I'm REALLY jealous about), K-Bone in Romania and Elizabeth M. in Cyprus.  You guys are lucky.  Take a lot of pictures.  Go see some movies...especially The Matrix: Reloaded. I'm stoked for today's release.  Spend some time out by the pool (with SPF 70 if you're in AZ).  Study if you're taking summer classes.  And last, but not least, if you're from St. Johns, Arizona...get your butt back up there for Pioneer Days so I can see you!!   HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!!

        "I know you wanna leave me, but I refuse to let you go..."    These glaring first words from the lyrics of  urlLink The Temptations  "Too Proud To Beg" have been a tried and true test that women truly dominate the lives of men.  It's not that we're sissies or pansies (ok, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that many exist), but look at the devotion the song has, "Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'."  What more could you ask for ladies? You want him to beg?  Throw him a doggie treat...he'll eat that sucker right up.  The funny thing about all of this is that  urlLink Rick Astley , the skinny, little Brit with that booming voice that makes you want to do a double-take to check his skin color, remade the song.

       Death is weird.   It's strange how death comes and takes not one, but many.  In just a week, two well-knowns from my hometown passed away, and just today, two people I looked up to also returned home.  David Brinkley was not necessarily one of my journalistic idles, but I respected him as a pioneer of the industry.  He was a veteran in all respects, and was a true transitionist being one of the first radio reporters to make the big switch to TV when the "tube" made its debut.  He badgered Clinton on air, which I thought was unnecessary in the sense it was presented.  He later apologized, and acknowleged the fact that the U.S. has enjoyed more prosperity in the Clinton years, than any other presidency in history...true.  I was saddened to learn of Gregory Peck's passing.  Once I saw  To Kill A Mockingbird , I was hooked on watching this man perform.  He carried the style and elegance of many of his contemporaries like Cary Grant and Clark Gable, but was able to distinguish himself as someone who emitted a sense of humility that others could not live up to.  He captured sensibility in the best of all ways, and played characters in his movies that led me to believe that chivalry still exists...or at the very least,  can  exist if you will it.  Just recently, his most famous character, Atticus Finch, was named the number one hero in film by  urlLink The American Film Institute .  He and Brinkley will both be missed.  And speaking of the AFI's list, the following characters (in my opinion) should have been ranked higher on the hero list:  Moses ( The Ten Commandments ) and Lou Gehrig ( The Pride of The Yankees )  Erin Brockovich ( Erin Brockovich ) should not even be on the list...the film was too recent, and not Julia's best work at all...give another Oscar to an undeserving performance why don't we?  The following villains should also be ranked higher:  Freddy Krueger ( A Nightmare On Elm Street ) and Joan Crawford (   Mommie Dearest )...oooh...both are equally scary.  No more wire hangers!!  Hannibal Lecter ( Silence of the Lambs   ) beat out Norman Bates ( Psycho ) and The Wicked Witch of The West ( The Wizard of Oz )...go figure.  Terminator ( Terminator ) shouldn't be on the list, because he eventually switches sides.  Enough!  Until next time!

       Just killin' time...   While I could be studying Mass Communication Law or doing my Albanian homework, I am sitting here, typing aimlessly with my t-shirt pulled over my head like Beavis doing Cornholio.  This past weekend was nice.  I went to St. Johns for some graduations.  My little cousin Britni graduated from 8th grade, even though she already looks like she's 17.  But after all the family and friends that have graduated, I'm kind of glad it's all over.  I ended up going to 12 graduations, and you all know how pleasant that can be.  I got to see a lot of family, and also be let in on the fact that my being a Mormon is a frequent topic of conversation among my oh-so-Catholic family counterparts.  Britni is my little informant, and she tells me that everyone knows that the reason I'm treated different is because I'm a Mormon.  Oh well...nothing's going to change that.  I got to visit with my friend Kyle and his new girlfriend, Jessica.  Kyle's mom is convinced she's the one.  I also went and had a good visit with Heather's parents and sister, Camille.  If you want to know the details, e-mail or call me...I'm not putting anything to do with Heather on here.  I came back for summer school, and after just two days, I can say that I think I'm truly going to like both of these classes.  For how cool the Critical Languages Institute is, I figured more people from ASU would take part in it, but I'm the only one in my class.  The others go to Tufts, Penn, Hofstra, CUNY, UC Berkeley, Univ. of Minnesota, and Univ. of Michigan.  I feel like a fish out of water in my own pond. But I like them, and it's exposing me to new things.   I also had a good chat with Dr. Wilkinson, and informed her that I'm planning on graduating next year.  I feel that even with an extra year on my scholarship, I would be wasting my time.  I'll be ready to move on in a year.  Well, I think I'll hit the sack and wake up at the crack of dawn and study then.  Seemed to help this morning. Naten e mire...mirupafshim...

       HAPPY 4th!!!    I love America.   If there's any more emotion I could put into those three words, it would only be that I would say it louder, sing it, highlight it, underline it, or italicize it.    I LOVE AMERICA!!    I wish I could thank my ancestors for having the wits and gumption about them to pack it up, pack it in, let it begin, and move their booties over to the new world.  Sure we've gone through a lot of changes since they got here.  We definitely have more fake breasts, cell phones, and worse politicians, but the point is we're still the home of the brave and land of the free.  So whether you boozing it up trying to figure out who else is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored, or whether you traveling from sea to shiny sea, here's a heartlfelt HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY!!  ***  I saw  urlLink Train , live in concert, this past Wednesday, and I have to say it was one of the better shows I've been to in a while.  Pat Monahan was dead on with his vocal chords, and was truly amazing live.  A band called Wilshire opened for them.  Train opened their set with the first track off their new album,  Calling All Angels , which was fantastic.  They played some of their other less-known songs that I hadn't heard, but really enjoyed.  Once  Drops of Jupiter  was played, I was out of there, because I had a Mass Comm Law final the next day.  I know now that I recieved a B in the class.  I liked it, enjoyed the prof and all, but such is life.  The concert was worth it.  ***  "Hell to pay" has been more than a phrase to me lately.  Withiout divulging too many details, I scrambled to make a deposit in the bank the other night to meet a midnight payment deadline on my insurance.  I drove to Circle K and got there around 9:05 p.m. to get a money order (my bank doesn't allow cash deposits into the ATM machine).  The clerk told me I was too late, that they stopped doing the money orders after 9 p.m.  After the fleeting thought of reaching across the counter to punch his ugly, tattooed face, I asked where he knew I could get one at that hour.  Of course he didn't.  As I walked out of the store, who should I find but Maureen and Danny.  I followed them home, gave 'em the cash, and got a check to make the midnight deadline.  Thanks for saving my butt, guys.   PERSON(S) OF THE WEEK:  My various-generationed great-grandfathers,  Alford Ayne Wallis-Stewart ,  Carlo Quinto Luigi D'Andrea ,  Alejandro Pedro Alday , and  Don Juan Saverio Antonio Garcia Saavedra y Ronquillo , for coming to the Promised Land,  Maureen and Danny  for the check, and my dad,  John A.

      Hindsight: Tirana, Albania  Well, I can honestly say that this place has grown on me.  Even though I have a distinct dust cloud that encircles me everywhere I go, I have a new-found affection for this place.  Don't get me wrong...everything I said the first time is still true, but it evidently takes some getting used to.  Classes here have been rather lax. The Foreign Language Faculty at the University of Tirana is not in the best of conditions, and isn't air conditioned.  So, for the sake of having us die, our professor, Gjovalin Shkurtaj, is having us meet in his air-conditioned office every day.  If you haven't been paying attention to the news, there is a massive heat wave going through Europe, and numerous people have died.  I am fortunate enough to have air-conditioning in my apartment, but by the time I get home to turn in on, the power cuts out for three hours while I lay there on the couch not moving a muscle and sweating profusely.  I'm being positive about this whole experience.  To be taken out of my comfortable confines in Arizona (where I sweat a lot less, ironically) has been a marvelous experience.  I didn't come to Tirana with any expectations, which was a good thing.  Had I come here thinking that I was going into a cushy resort country, I would be dead wrong.  There are nice places, but in a country that is restructuring itself such as Albania, those nice places are far and few between.  A few days ago, we went to the seaside city of Durres.  I had to laugh on the beach as I looked to one side seeing an industrial port stretching out into the Adriatic, and some sort of plant or factory on the other side.  The Albanians were more that content to squeeze this little bit of beach (a lot of non sany dirt and craggy rocks) to the sea.  The Albanian people stare at me as if I'm a ghost...or if not that, some overweight American (which is obviously a more accurate representation :) ).  If you talk to them, they respond, and are usually friendly.  I've decided to take a taxi every morning to the university so I can have a little morning chat to brush up on what I learned the day before.  I've gotten into a routine witht the same two "taksi" drivers, Ilir and Bledar, and they've even given me a small discount on the fares.  Taxis in Tirana are cheap...I'm talking $1.50 to $3.00 per ride within the city.  Considering they're all experienced drivers, it's probably the safest route to take.  I'm tired all the time.  I sleep way to much, and I hope I get out of that habit when I get home, simply because I'll need to.  But the point of all this is, for some strange reason, I like Tirana.

       Dead Tired In Europe   Well, my friends, I have finally arrived in Tirana, Albania.  And I must say that it is like no other place in Europe that you could imagine.  Forget the houghtiness of the French, the properness of the Brits, and the style of the Italians.  This is just plain, flat out, hard-core Eastern Europe.  I'm looking out onto the main square right now, and I can still see the formation of the old communist parade grounds.  It's amazing.  It's blistering hot and humid here, and although some places have air conditioning, the power cuts out in the middle of the day.  Sometimes in the late afternoon you hear the humming and buzzing of generators replacing the power that is out for usually two to three hours.  Tirana's Rinas Airport is nothing to brag about.  It's very small and cramped, and the airport workers literally fake their job when running your bags through the x-ray and metal detector.  Neither of the machines work.  Police were practically beating off taxi drivers who wanted to take us into Tirana.  My teacher, Linda, had her friend Genti pick me up.  For lack of better words in using an overused phrase, he drove like a bat out of hell, and I thought I was going to die before I even got to my apartment.  Tirana is a city of roughly 1 million people, and I've seen maybe four traffic lights.  They don't stop for pedestrians here.  It's bizarre.  You just better get your behind over to the other side of the street before some 1982 Mercedes-Benz runs it over.  I'm staying in the center of the city.  I have a lot of sights from my balcony, including the National History Museum, the National Bank, a large mosque, and a couple of the government ministries.  The only other Americans I've seen are my classmates.  We went out to eat last night and saw the Parliament and the presidents house. His phone number is in the phonebook here.  Also, there is only one phonebook for the entire country. When we walked by the presidents house after dinner, an armed guard with some antiquated Italian machine gun forced us off the sidewalk and into the street.  So our only option from avoiding a shooting was getting run over by...yep, you guessed it, some 1982 Mercedes-Benz.  The sidewalks are crumbling here.  Many roads are unpaved, even in the city. I fall asleep to the sound of dogs fighting in the street, and wake up to cats hissing at each other on the roof.  I typically buy a few bottles of water a day, and maybe a bottle of Fanta if the price is right.  My internet time is costing me 250 lek an hour (roughly $2 American).  Yesterday, a classmate of mine named Joe and I were walking in the center, and we literally ran into our other classmate, Nathan, who had just stepped of his bus from Greece.  You should have seen the look on his face.  Elation is the only word I could use to describe.  If you do believe in God, I'm pretty sure he made it so that we ran into each other.  Otherwise, Nathan could have been in a whole lot more trouble.  His bus deserted him at the Greek-Albanian border, and he had to persuade (and pay) another bus driver to take him the rest of the way.  We felt rather awkward after dinner last night.  We had seen a group of rather attractive girls, and Joe wanted to go talk to them.  I'm not necessarily here to make such acquantances, but they looked like very clean, good down-to-earth girls.  We talked for awhile, but they said unless we had any money, they wouldn't be able to talk much longer.  They were prostitutes.  Everyone smokes here.  Men, women, children...in bars, cafes, and even in the internet center right now, there are two ashtrays on either side of me.  I'm going to brink a distinct Albanian smokey stench back home with me, I'm sure.  I'm never dry.  I'm either sweating or in the shower.  For this very reason, Linda is taking us camping on the southern coast.  It'll be good to get out of the heat for a while.  But even then, I'm still suffering from some major jet lag.  I have been managing on my own quite well.  Most of the Albanians assume that I'm Italian, so they speak to me in Italian first.  Then they look at my white shoes, and say, "Ah, ti je nje amerikan! (Oh, you're an American!)"  It's certainly a different place here, but I can tell you that I'm certainly in for an experience of a lifetime.  Until next time...

       The Demise of Summer, or  How I Scored Ten Dates, But Only Went On Three and Never Got A Second One    Well, in a matter of days, will be off to the Land of Eagles...Albania.  Many of you have asked, "Why Albania, John?"  Such a thought-provoking question has cornered me in even the deepest, darkest recesses of my mind.  My retort to you: "Why NOT Albania?"  Granted, many of you have no freaking clue where Albania is.  Some of you politico-film buffs tell me that it's an imaginary country that some presidential advisor and filmmaker conceived to divert the nation's attention.  For this reason did I decide to sell my copy of  Wag The Dog . Nevertheless, I'm sure it will be a fun trip, and I'll be able to give you some insights on their human trafficking and drug problems, but also the great people, the late despot Enver Hoxha, and why they love the Belushi Brothers.  For some Albanian info, check out  urlLink Albanian.com .  For Albanian music, give  urlLink Albasoul  a whirl.  Pioneer Days: Smashing good time.  Although I didn't go to every event, I was happy to return home for the dances, the parade, the food, and of course the good times with my buddy Kyle.  One interesting aspect of the weekend was meeting the newest group of inductees into The Husband Club.  There were 40 some odd girls that I graduated High School with, and just four short years later, 22 of them are married.  I had the privilege of meeting a handful of these jerks, who scoffed at the mere fact that I've been home from my mission 15 months and am still unmarried.  Right.  And y'all acted like pricks to me because...???  Gimme a break.  It's not like I was ever former competition or anything. Why would I want to marry anyone from my class?  There were 100 of us...it'd be like marrying my sister.  If  I had a sister, that is.  So, summer is over. Nearly, anyway. I guess I can say that it was a good one, despite the fact that the title is absolutely true.  I suppose I can't expect too much from girls.  It's not like I'll meet the perfect one anytime soon.  Over the past year, I've managed to keep the three same girls floating in my head, and I'll be lucky if one of them wants anything to do with me.  It's not often that a Liz Phair or Leisel Von Trapp can just walk into my life and change it.  You've gotta have patience and faith.  Magari ci fosse Heather qui.  Until next time...I'll see you in Shqiperia (That's Albania in Albanian).   PERSON(S) OF THE WEEK:  Joe Doiron, Rebecca Falkoff, Nathan Kuhlman, Alex Derenzy Channer, Nick Tochka, Erin Mote, Ernie Markle, James Trimarco, and Linda Meniku for a fantastic Albanian summer in Tempe.

       GRE RESULTS/GRAD SCHOOL UPDATE   For those of you who didn't know, I've been silently (and at times quite loudly) been beating my head against the wall as I try and prepare myself for grad school.  My dear friend  urlLink Matt Schuh  recently recieved his LSAT scores and published a similar report on his pursuits of post-baccalaureate happiness on his site.  I took my GRE on Monday, and did much worse than I thought.  Matt ventured to tell you his score, but I don't even want to do that with mine.  This may seem "radical" to some, but if I'm to be judged on test scores as opposed to academic performance, community service, foreign languages, and work experience, then those schools can bugger off.  I'm much better than what those paltry test scores present me to be.  Like Matt, I have also finalized a list of several (if not too many) schools to apply to:  :: Syracuse University (Syracuse, NY) :: Columbia University (New York City) :: The Fletcher School-Tufts University (Medford, MA) :: Princeton University (Princeton, NJ) :: University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) :: Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (Washington, D.C.) :: Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.) :: University of Missouri-Columbia (Columbia, MO) :: Indiana University (Bloomington, IN) :: University of Texas-Austin (Austin, TX) :: The University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ) :: Arizona State University (Tempe, AZ)  There it is...12 schools, 5 of which may actually accept me in all reality...if I'm lucky. And think of all the cool mascots of these schools! Two of 'em are Tigers, then you've got Orangemen, Lions, Jumbos, Panthers, Blue Jays, Hoyas, Hoosiers, Longhorns, Wildcats, and of course...Sun Devils.   But what is it you're looking to study?  There are three programs among all of these schools I'd be interested in applying to: a Master of Public Administration, a Master of Public Affairs, or a Master of International Affairs.  In the case of the Fletcher School, it would be a Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy.   Are you going to retake the GRE?  Hell no...you think I have time or money?   Do you think now is the time to continue your academic pursuits, or would you be more inclined to work for a while?  Ummm, yeah.  If I don't carry through with it now, I'll never do it.  God forbid I could, at least, get into ASU's program.   What are some of the more appealing programs?  I like Syracuse because it's only a year.  I like UT because it's got a great program, much like Pitt.  I like UofA and ASU because it's home ;)

       SUPREME COURT TO TACKLE SUPREME BEING IN PLEDGE   I’ve got two words for you.  “Under God.”  That’s right, these two words are creating a stirring cacophony again in recent weeks as the Supreme Court of the United States began to hear almost 2,000 appeals, including one on removing these words from the Pledge of Allegiance. 	 This stems from a case in California last year where Dr. Michael Newdow, an unemployed emergency room physician, brought his case before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Like many others, Newdow asked the perennial question: are we, indeed, one nation under God? And should schoolchildren be asked to recite the pledge everyday? 	 Well, if children can be subjected to common things like violence and sex on TV, surely they can recite a simple reference in the pledge that was added by Congress in 1954, a reference that U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson calls an “official acknowledgement of our nation’s religious heritage.” 	 Even if the First Amendment says, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” the Constitution also guarantees our freedom of speech. Either say it, or don’t.  Nowhere does it say that one must state it, much as someone who takes an oath of office or before a court need not say, “so help me God.” Unless you’re about to take the oath of office as the President, of course. 	 But there’s one striking thing in Newdow’s involvement that isn’t quite legit. 	 Newdow claims that as a father, he has a right to withhold public schools from “indoctrinating his impressionable young daughter on a daily basis in that official view.” However, Newdow doesn’t even have custody of his daughter, who along with her mother, who has sole custody, supports the pledge as it is. 	 Whether we’re now “one nation, under God” or not, we’re still one nation…period.   Although we have numerous faiths, we must recognize that whether we believe in one Supreme Being over another, we should respect the fact that our country was founded on many religious principles. If you say we need to get rid of these words, let’s axe the last verse of our National Anthem, get rid of  “God Bless America” altogether, and call the U.S. Mint to start rolling the presses on some new currency. 	 In the words of the courts, “The recitation that ours is a nation 'under God' is not a mere acknowledgment that many Americans believe in a deity.” 	 So whether you praise Allah, Buddha, Krishna or hell, even Kurt Cobain, nobody is trying to force a major establishment of religion upon you.  We are entitled to many liberties as citizens of this great country. Among those liberties is freedom of religion, although in recent times, more people have been fighting for freedom  from  religion.  With all the hoopla that’s encircling the religious aficionados who value their faith dearly, it makes me think of one other adage that promotes deity: “In God We Trust.” 	 But really… do we ?		 	 The world is rampant with heightened security precautions due to terrorism, criminal activities are still present, poor economic conditions still exist, and a barrage of other things still cause a thin veil of fear to be draped across the world.  Sheesh, with all that, you’d figure Dr. Newdow might find better things to do, like find a job and make attempts to spend more time with his daughter.

BIG RONK 2 will officially launch as soon as I get around to editing my post.  The format will primarily be the same, yet different.

       "Typical journo's answer..." - Billy Kwan,  The Year of Living Dangerously    Just a quick note to George W. Bush:  You know, I think it's great that you want to get back into the space exploration thing so badly.  In fact, I think we should reward your valor with a first class trip back home to Mars...  Enough of that...no political tirades tonight...  Today was Day 2 of Camp State Press, and I must say that the face of that independent daily has changed tremendously.  I had never envisioned that I would cross over to the "dark side," but I'm glad that I did. I feel that the editorial leadership is at a peak, and I anticipate this Spring 2004 semester to be one of the better ones in its history.  We were privileged to have Richard Ruelas of The Arizona Republic and Mark Scarp of the East Valley (or is he with Scottsdale?) Tribune.  Although I have disagreed with tons of things Mr. Ruelas has said in his column-writing past, I like what he had to say.  I think Tim Agne was the most logical choice for the Opinions Editor...and mildly wish he had held the position last semester.  Some of the columnists to keep your eye on this semester:   Christian Palmer :  Christian has a semester under his belt as a columnist already, and is one of the few I have seen who actually goes out and researches his topics, which we are all encouraged to do.   I had him in Joe Russomanno's Media Law class this summer, and I can tell you that Christian is, indeed, a smart guy.  He'll have a lot to say.   Brian Clapp :  Brian wrote several guest columns last semester, and probably had the most eclectic array of columns under his belt.  They were well-written and balanced. He's a Flinn Scholar for crying out loud...he'll have plenty of intelligent things to say.   Katie McCrory :  Katie is a British foreign exchange student on loan from us form her university in Edinburgh, Scotland.  She wrote for her paper there, and has a keen perspective on world issues.  She has a desire to incormporate some humor into her writing as well, so be sure to check it out.   Lucia Bill :  Chia might be young, but she's darned intelligent. I don't like her just because she's part of the Wes Clark campaign here in Arizona, but also because she's on top of things and has a great accent =). I think she's going to have a lot of great things to write about.  These are just a few of the columnists...but please do read everyone's writings.  We have an awesome team, and there's going to be a lot of good, controversial, introspective things coming the reader's way.

       Break Time Ticking Away   I must say that I have enjoyed my time away from school.  It's been nice to put ASU completely aside for the bulk of the entire winter break, but I know I'll have to hit the ground running when January 20th rolls around.  This weekend was a long one and a good one.  I got to pull down two ASU basketball games (men of course, I'm still boycotting the ASU women's games), dinner with Schuh, Snowden and Julie J, and a good Sunday at church and watching Marcia perform with Street Jam at the Kerr Cultural Center in Scottsdale.  My friend Tara came with me to the ASU/Stanford game (a heartbreaker loss), and I was so psyched she came.  I don't think she realized how long I'd been waiting to hang out and just talk to her...but she has a boyfriend, and it's hard to do that when the girls have boyfriends.  YES, YES, I KNOW.  The time has come for me to stop hanging out with girls who have boyfriends...   Church News   I think I'm finally starting to like my ward and am begging to immerse myself in the church again.  It's something I've needed because I realize I've been extremely prideful and selfish regarding my status with the church.  It's not that I stopped believeing or anything...that would never happen...it was just that my delusions of some of the people got the best of me, and I was just turned off to them.  But I know that I am where I'm supposed to be, and I think God has intervened properly and quietly.  Things will only get better if I do what is right.  For the first time since I returned from my mission I actually have LDS friends, and they are some of the most amazing and selfless individuals.  A "coworker" of sorts has virtually changed a lot about the way I look at things.  She's made strides to help me find a place where I belong, and has been a great source of inspiration.  I'm also meeting more people in the ward, and I'm realizing that I have a lot in common with some of the people.    Singles wards aren't all the bad.  A lot of the people in my ward are out of school and are older.  By older I mean 26, 27, 29, whatever...I think the youngest guy in my ward is 21, fresh off his mission, and the youngest girl is probably 23.  Of course we're all pelted with hints of marriage, but you learn quickly to shrug them off if you want to.  President Udall asked me last week, "So, have you found the girl of your dreams?"  I told him no, but I was really thinking,  Yeah, but she's marrying a guy name D*****.   Such is life...until next time...

       SUCCESSFUL UPDATE!!   Geez, for about the past month I've been trying to get in here and give an update or seven, but for some reason, I wasn't given access! Argh...  Alas, here is my first update of the New Year.  In case you weren't paying attention, we are now in the year 2004.  Holy crap...really? OK, maybe I wasn't the one paying attention.  I would suppose the most exciting recent news is that friends Michael Komenda and Jennica Dewitt were wed yesterday in the Mesa LDS Temple. Fellow blogmeister Matt Schuh and I attended a very nice reception and were privy to see the happy couple.  All I remember doing is shaking hands, giving hugs, and repeating to myself (and Matt), "I can't believe Jennica and Mike are married!"  I said that in a good way of course.  Congratulations to you!  May your lives be filled with health and prosperity, and of course a whole new generation of Komenda wisecracks...we love ya.  This winter break has proven to be more eventful than I imagined.  My Microeconomics course has been quite interesting and entertaining, yet also time consuming and demanding.  I haven't even traveled anywhere during the break.  I didn't even go to St. Johns or Tucson for Christmas...and that's a first.  However, the holidays were very nice, and I spent my New Year's in great fashion with great people.  I volunteered at the Fiesta Bowl festivities with my father on the day of the game, and was fortunate enough to get tickets.  I phoned Schuh with about 30 minutes before kickoff, and we made it and enjoyed it.  I really didn't want to root for Ohio State (some of us don't forget the '97 Rose Bowl versus ASU), but we were situated right by the OSU fans.  In all reality, they were fun to sit by and high five after scores and great plays.  I must admit that Schuh and I secretly wanted a tight game, and wanted Kansas State to score just so we could see their mascot do the silly little KSU dance.  I found it to be frighteningly hilarious.  The next week will be the last free one before I start my final semester of college. I'll finish Econ, go to "Camp State Press" before I start writing columns, and have another PAB retreat before my term starts winding down.  It should be fun.  Until then, keep checking back...hopefully it'll be updated more!!

       MTV saves marriage from big fat FOX   Big. Fat. Obnoxious.   No, these aren't exactly the words that my last date used to describe me.   They are, however, part of the FOX network's newest attempt to mingle reality and scripted TV into a fusion of dysfunctional wedding fun in "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé."   It is highly likely that many of you tuned in last night to see the second episode in the six-part series. Much to your amusement, you watched as 23-year-old Randi Coy, a first grade teacher from Scottsdale, tried to pass off a big, fat, obnoxious professional actor named Steve as her fiancé as he attempts to flirt and fart his way to Randi's heart.   In what FOX calls "the ultimate practical joke," Randi must convince her disapproving family that she and Steve are truly engaged. According to the show, Randi "must make it all the way through the wedding ceremony and final 'I do's' in order to win a million dollars."   Is this truly what little respect is left for a sacred institution such as marriage? Granted, most people are willing to do anything for a buck, but is it really worth it to say "I do" when, in fact, you don't? The show is a joke. But be that as it may, it shows a complete lack of reverence for marriage in general and shows what little impact marriage has on today's couples.   Randi's family is as detrimental to the process as she is. If it were Evan Marriott, the handsome simpleton of "Joe Millionaire" fame, I am convinced that the outcome would be slightly altered. (It's a marriage pun, get it?) Randi's family would probably be more willing to tolerate the farting, breaking vases, and telling his future father-in-law that he can't wait to sleep with his daughter if it were coming from an attractive guy. But as the heaving gut on the show's Web site proves, FOX and the family are putting the emphasis on the "Fat" part of the title.   Ironically, I find more substance in the MTV reality programs that showcase married couples. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne may be freakishly foul with the "f-bomb," Jessica Simpson may have the intelligence of a can of tuna (or is it chicken?), and Carmen Electra and Dave Navarro may get naked for the wedding invites, but there is an underlying theme of happiness, love and the will to just make things work, things that couples should strive for to have a solid marriage. The major networks would have us believe that these values have departed.   The big networks use manipulation, greed, envy and debauchery while depending on the destruction of self-esteem to boost their ratings. MTV shows love in strange and eclectic ways while big networks incessantly continue to raffle off trophy wives.   Misleading people is one of the bulkiest themes in reality TV. "Paradise Hotel," another FOX byproduct, was built entirely upon deception through secret alliances. But let's get real, the series showed little paradise and just a lot of shacking up.   Another example is NBC's "Average Joe" and "Average Joe 2: Hawaii," a show that eliminates any real potential of Larissa, a former Miss Missouri, selecting an "Average Joe" by predictably ushering in every Abercrombie and Fitch designer's dream: eight overconfident, hormone-induced "hunks."   Twist the knife a bit deeper into the Joes' frail, little hearts, why don't you?   Marriage deserves more respect than it gets from shows that deliver cheap moments of entertainment. The sad part is we watch it, accept it and adopt it. Be unique and don't say "I do" to these shows.   As for Randi and Larissa, fear not, their fifteen minutes of fame shall soon pass. Hopefully their chances at a legitimate and good marriage won't go with it.   This column appeared in the January 27th edition of The State Press.

       While I know some have suggested that I not post anything printed in The State Press, I am going to post my most recent column...deal with it.    Tillman not Arizona's only hero  By John Ronquillo Published: Tuesday, April 27, 2004    Raymond Losano, Benjamin Biskie, Jay Aubin, Alyssa Peterson, and Nathan White.   Few of us recognize the names of these people who felt inside themselves a burning to defend our country. They are Arizona soldiers who have paid the ultimate price to ensure our freedom and are heroes in their own right who gave their lives in either Afghanistan or Iraq, fighting in battles that have raged for more than a year.   As the news of each new casualty came, our hearts sank a little bit deeper as the war escalated.   The news of Pat Tillman's death has spread faster than you can bat an eyelash, and in just four days, every TV news media outlet -- from CNN to MTV -- has covered the story. Nearly every paper has printed an image of the soldier with piercing eyes and a square jaw carrying the American flag, an image most of us will never forget.   The death of Arizona's favorite strong safety-turned-Army Ranger has drawn tears from fans and admirers while garnering a huge media response -- something I'm sure Tillman would hate.   Growing up in Arizona, I have learned of many war heroes such as Frank Luke and Ira Hayes, and I've listened to my grandfathers tell me war stories of Pearl Harbor and fighting in India, Burma and China.   While there is only one Pat Tillman, some of us are failing to realize that there are many who have gone before him and many yet to follow who have the same qualities: honor, pride, integrity and humility. We have all grown to appreciate his diligence and humility and the way he quietly left the sidelines of Sun Devil Stadium to join the front lines of the war on terrorism.   While we greatly admire the sacrifice Tillman made, many others have led or followed in the same manner without the media attention. And in some cases, it's been the media attention that has drawn our focus away from what is really important: honoring those who have defended us.   The numerous eulogies in honor of Tillman have called for monuments and various sites to be named after him, and in some form or another, it will be done. The numbers he wore will be retired, and the plaza surrounding the new Cardinals stadium, scheduled to open in 2006 in Glendale, will be named "Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza."   In contrast, the tributes to Pfc. Lori Piestewa, were not as welcome. Arizona state Route 51 was renamed the "Piestewa Freeway," and Squaw Peak was renamed "Piestewa Peak" after the soldier, who was killed last year in Iraq.   This change did not come without an outcry of opposition. Was it so hard to name a stretch of asphalt and concrete, and a small mountain previously labeled with a word offensive to some Native Americans after Piestewa?   It is only right to honor all who have laid down their lives, no matter the circumstance. Pat Tillman walked away from his family, his friends and millions of dollars for what he thought was right, and he did it quietly.   It is said that Army Rangers fight like lions and soar like eagles. Pat Tillman exemplified that. He stands out because other people identified with him. He was humble and reclusive by his own choice. Let us honor Tillman in the true fashion that he would have shown, by honoring all of those who have given their lives to protect ours.   To the soldiers who have given your lives: we mourn for you all.

        Demise of Summer 2004           You knew it would come.  The time of year when you finally realize that you must become something inane again rather than basking in the frivolous days of nothing that we call summer.      Actually, I didn't really do that, but I wanted to give it a try.   So, here we are again in August - the most miserable month of the year.  Blistering hot days, the knowledge of school starting soon, and the month of my mother's birthday and endless chants of "I hate birthdays!" wafting through the air.  I am actually starting to get excited to start grad school, considering I never thought I would.  Hopefully, in two or three years, after I get my MPA I'll want to keep going so I never have to pay off my student loans.  Granted, it would only be $9,000 for two degrees earned at ASU, but freak...who wants to pay bills?  I'll keep this short for now and try to publish more often.  I suck, I know.  Don't you dare rub it in.  Late.

						    WELCOME TO BIG RONK 2!!!   You may be asking yourself, "Why spoil something that's already good?"  Well, that's just the thing!  It wasn't good!  So, I'm creating a sister site to catch my  urlLink BIG RONK  overflow.  The content will pretty much be the same...nothing like Cinemax where one channel is lame and the other shows softcore porn at 5 p.m.  Although I'm sure it might be exciting for some of you!  However, BIG RONK 2 may be a little more in-depth, political, risque, and will definitely make fun of reality TV shows more often.  Come on, admit it, you've always had things on your mind but have never wanted to say them.  Well, I'll probably do that here.  Who else wouldn't want to read rantings of a half-breed Mexican-Italian Mormon Democrat from Arizona?  Well, I have an idea, but that's just the point.  Be prepared to RONK yourself out!

						    OFFICIAL UN-OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT : Al Sharpton for President   The anxiety that has held me in a tight ball of nerves for months is finally coming to a close today, as any political prowess I assumed to have will surely manifest itself sometime before my Country/Western dance class tonight.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, the Arizona Democratic Primary.  Missouri, South Carolina, Oklahoma and Delaware are the other states joining Arizona in primaries, while caucuses gather in New Mexico and North Dakota. This array of states is allowing the assorted field of democrats to make what may be some of their final chances to attempt to establish residency at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 	 While Massachusetts senator John Kerry commands a strong lead in the polls in Arizona, I have weighed my options heavily in determining who Iâ€™ll place my vote for. It would seem difficult to some to monitor any equal coverage rules as far as campaigning in the media is concerned, which may not be entirely too pleasing to some of the contenders. In the words of comedian Dick Gregory, â€œHell hath no fury like a liberal scorned.â€ 	 Many people have flaunted various buttons during this campaign, such as the now infamous, â€œAnybody but Bushâ€ buttons. Supporters of Howard Dean got creative last year during Halloween and dawned bright orange buttons that said, â€œBush frightens me.â€ Yes, Howard, Bush frightens me, too.  Was he, by any chance, the one who taught you how to scream like a pterodactyl? 	 Regardless of what propaganda has been put forth by all of the campaigns, there is one candidate that has struck a chord deep within me that will continue to resonate for much time to come. A candidate who is â€œkeeping the dream aliveâ€ and â€œfighting for fundamental human rights.â€  Iâ€™m talking about the next president of the United States, the Reverend Al Sharpton. 	 This one-time cantankerous member of James Brownâ€™s entourage (who coincidentally jumped to the Godfather of Soulâ€™s aid this week after an arrest on charges of domestic assault) is now one of the most prolific figures in American politics today.  While many candidates boast degrees from Ivy League institutions, Sharpton comes from a background that more Americans can identify with. 	 Although I may err to say that he has any legitimate chance to become president, I will not deny him any respect to say that he has become a force to be reckoned with. Previous runs for the U.S. Senate and Mayor of New York City during the 90s have all garnered him reputable esteem. His exuberant and sometimes flagrant interactions with racial activism placed him in the hot seat a number of times, and his audacity to enter the national spotlight again as a presidential candidate shows volumes for how much the man truly desires to spark change within people. 	 Sharpton is by far the most diverse candidate among the presidential contenders. His appeal to minority and youth voters is inspiring, and his great articulation and quick wit have helped him hold his own while debating his opponents.  After Howard Dean bragged of having significant support among African-Americans and Latinos in Congress, Sharpton coolly replied, â€œOnly people with bad credit need co-signers.â€ 	 Today is a great opportunity for all democrats to exercise their right to vote.  Even if people have become disenchanted with the current state of American democracy, there is still hope among several democrats to relieve the first president appointed by the U.S. Supreme Court of his executive duties.    As I head to the nearby trailer park (my polling place) to cast my vote, youâ€™d better believe Iâ€™ll be remembering my favorite underdog.
