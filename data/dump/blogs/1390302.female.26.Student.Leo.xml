        "Adulthood"   WritersDigest.com prompt for 12/20/2003 - Written on 01/25/04:  At what point in your life did you realize you were finally an adult? Write a journal entry about it.  It would be easy to say that I realized I was an adult when I graduated High School or turned eighteen, though it would be a lie.  As I look back and consider the events of my life thus far, I would say that I realized I was an adult not when I married for the first time but when I divorced.  Divorce is something that marks you, something you remember for the whole of your life.    When I was a sophomore in high school I started dating Mike, it was August 94.  He was a good guy, and we really enjoyed one another company.  We had a good time together, he started living with my family -his parents were divorced.  We spent a good deal of time together, which eventually lead to our first big fight in December 94, only four months after we started dating.  This of course led to years of fighting, nearly non-stop.  We had several good years together, got engaged in February 96, graduated high school in May 96, and began to plan our wedding.  We got married in July 98 and as I look back now I realize that it was the worst mistake I have ever made.  When the day came, I did not want to do it, yet I felt that there was no going back so I closed my eyes and jumped.  We began to fight almost immediately, and after the wedding he hit me several times.  I put a stop to that, yet we were still living with my parents and we were pretty unhappy.  I had just turned 20.    In November of 98 we began looking for a house, still not getting along yet feeling that we would be more settled and content if we were on our own.  I didn't want to buy a house, Mike did.  I wanted to rent an apartment, he said no.  So we bought a house in December 98 and moved in around Christmas time. The fighting did not even come close to stopping.  Immature as I was, immature as he was, the fighting went on.  Many late night fights later I told him that if something didn't change I was leaving by June, it was January 97.  Nothing changed and I met someone new.  No, I didn't leave Mike for Matt; I left Mike for my sanity and piece of mind.  Matt was there for me and we forged a bond.  Mike had caused me years of therapy for problems that he caused me to have, I just couldn't take it anymore.  Mike and I divorced in June of 99, 11 months after our wedding, one month shy of our first anniversary.  It was a fight from the world "divorce."  He refused to let me go and I refused to allow him to make me stay.  Two weeks of pain ensued and when it final bell rung, I was free of him forever.  He paid for the divorce and I moved to Texas.  I don't remember crying once; it was all a big relief to be through with the fighting and pain that he had caused me for the 5 years we were together.  No, I take it back, I cried once.  It was not because I was sad that we wouldn't be together anymore.  I knew instantly that I was that I was depressed that though I knew when I married him that I didn't want to, I had forged myself into one of the hoarding masses of divorcee's; I had turned myself into a statistic. In 1999 42% of marriages ended in divorce, I was just one of the 42%.  It was a real eye opener.    Bam! Adulthood, not an easy transition from the immaturity of childhood to the fully awake realization that you're an adult and there is no one there to catch you.  For me it was as if the safety net that are parents had been removed, replaced by a million-foot drop to the oblivion of the years ahead.  Suddenly everything looked so damn different and I told myself that I would never marry another man, so help me God!  I moved to Texas and in with Matt.  1,500 miles away from my family, I was an adult.  Matt had made it clear to me that he didn't believe in marriage, I had told him that was good because I would jump from an airplane with no parachute before I would tie myself to another man with a little gold band and a rock.  I just wasn't for me, marriage I mean.  Welcome to adulthood.  I was wrong yet again, Matt and I married in February of 2000 and we have been married for nearly four years. He and are very happy together and we intend to be for a very long time.  So, while my adulthood came with a price tag that was more than I had bargained for, I lived, most of us do.  I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone, though I can't help feeling like tough experience forge us into better adults.   ~Kristyn

        "He's Coming" - Startrek based   The following is a posting that I wrote a while back for a an internet PBeM, the USS Yashida  (Notes: Anything that says "Hunter" is not my writing, as PBeM is a group activity & italics signify thought rather than speech.)  (( Bridge ))  :: Mya stood staring out at the wormhole thought the main viewer. Her eyes scanned its depths as if she was looking to find something and her mind rested for the time. Taking one last glance around the room at all of the officers she had served with aboard the Yashida she sighed inwardly, how could they possibly know or understand what was coming? They couldn't, there was no way in this universe that they would know why this was happening or it greater significance.  So be it...  the thought had come and gone and she began to bask in the dim red lights the bulkheads provided as she prepared herself for the pleasure of contact.  :: It had been so long, too long. She had heard the calling of her mother's beautiful mind within hers for all of these years, pushing her forward with the promise of great things to come. She had been away from her family and her home and had not the mental ecstasy she so desired, to initiate the intimacy and the feeling of utter control it brought her and the intimacy of its touch. The touch she would soon initiate, the mind of her brother opening up to her, allowing her touch, her search. The thought of it, the promise of its feeling made her shiver with anticipation.::   Soon my mother, soon. As I have promised you, soon.   :: The time had nearly come, she was nearly ready and she was unsure whether she could take the waiting any longer when she felt the presence of Hunter beside her. Turning her gaze on him unhappily, then apathetically,  stay calm, he could not possibly know what he has interrupted  she waited for him to speak, to make his purpose clear to her.::  Hunter: "You sure you're okay with this?"   How could I not be, how tired I am of that QUESTION!!!   Mya: ::Calmly:: "I am" ::nodding::  Hunter: "I'm not to sure if I'd feel the same way if I were in your position."   ::She turned her gaze on him squarely, this was his idea and she considered reminding him of that,  Stay calm  would he do the same? She was pretty sure he would, however foolish.::  Mya: ::Calmly:: "Do I have any other choice? Would you do the same if you were the telepath and this were my idea, to risk your life?"  Hunter: "I can't really reply in anyway to that. I know what you have to do and that it has to be done. But still. I can't help feeling that this might do more harm than good."  Mya: ::Anger flashing then calm:: "The decisions have been made, weather harmful or beneficial, you shall see soon enough."  :: Silently she shamed herself for using a singular, she knew what she should have said was "we" would all know soon enough. Still the moment had passed and Hunter didn't seem to catch it, she glanced at Adler then, who looked on the exchange and on her with that same look of strange curiosity. She was fairly sure in that moment that he had caught it, even if Hunter and the others had not.  :: Enough of this, it was time to do what she had come here to do. Stepping only a half step away from Hunter she turned her full attention back on the monitor. She took a deep breath and began, began to fulfill her destiny.  :: Her eyes fell on its vision with eager anticipation and she closed them for the briefest of moments, her mind reaching out with all of its mental capability to find the mind which promised to bring her closer to that which she searched for. Her eyes sprang open in that moment of contact, the blue flames consuming any black in her eyes. To anyone looking on her brilliant orbs in that moment, they would find blue fires like nothing they had seen before, blue fires that threatened to spring forth and consume them all. Blue flames which could light the bridge and then some with their intensity.  :: Hey eyes never narrowed and she only blinked and kept them turned on the main viewer. His mind was so refreshing to her and she could feel his pleasure at her touch, as it should be. The mind of a male, his warrior pleasures, carnal and raw, pleased her. She searched the mind that had been open to her, the plans for their actions spilled out before her like wet, warm blood pouring forth and she nearly smiled, nearly cried out from the memory of it all so long ago.  :: To M'uri, to Mya there was no feeling like anticipation, yet this reunion threatened to over come her. How could she feign pain, how could she pretend to be anything other then what she was for any longer. In the intense pleasure of it all she had reached out an grasped the arm of someone, of Hunter.::  Hunter: Are they contacting you. What are they saying...  :: She heard his words and for the first time since she had initiated contact with them did she frown. Hunter's words threatened to interrupt her pleasure and the unraveling of his plans. Her frown carried to him and the light, the blue light in her eyes flared ever brighter as she continued her mental search through the mind of her brother. Hunter didn't go on, he didn't speak again and releasing him she continued her mental link, to touch the mind of a male, the thrill. So mentally weak were their male counterparts, so physically powerful.  :: She could hear what was happening around her and her mind took it all in as a secondary response as she concentrated on what she was accomplishing and her mind did the rest, deciphering the goings on around her. She knew in her mind, somewhere, that Adler was on the bridge, and a smile suddenly widened on her face then was gone nearly as quickly. Suddenly she felt him beside her and she turned her head, exposing the blue flames of her heritage to the man. Her eyes wide, never blinking. It would look to any one who didn't understand almost as a possession.  ::Then her eyes narrowed and she spoke in a whisper, her tone sounding like something from the depths of a horror novel in its spine tingling softness.::  Mya: ::in a nearly inaudible whisper meant for Adler and perhaps Hunter: "I feel him, called to him, our minds one."  Hunter: "What do you mean "Feel him?" Who's him?"  Mya: "He's coming" ::she whispered again nearly inaudibly, a small forewarning, a forewarning they would never be able to prepare for.::  ~ Dr. Mya Aaryn, Medical Officer, USS Yashida ~     ~Kristyn

       Spring Prompts from Creativity-Portal.com:  What are three things that you enjoy most about the spring season?  The coming of the spring in Central Texas is a complete feast for the senses.  When the winter chill has gone, leaving moist, fertile green ground behind, the spring time brings the singing of birds, warming of the sun, and the blossoming of thousands blue bonnets.  Fields of the most startling, beautiful blues cover the ground as far as the eye can see, coloring Texas blue with itâ€™s state flower.  The days of spring are warm and pleasing in Texas.  While not hot, and not cold, the sun shines on the lone star state in radiant clarity.  Crisp morning air and blue, blue skies bring the promise of the days to come.  The birds sing and the sun shimmers on the lake in a million sparkles of diamond shimmer.  Spring showers cool the days and water the beautiful land to itâ€™s oh so green brilliance.  Everything just seems right under the sun in Central Texas when springtime comes.  Even the people seem more pleasant when the leaves and flowers are blooming on long dormant trees.  Days spent on the river or at the lake usher spring toward summer in radiant warmth and friendship.  Spring is the most peaceful and beautiful of seasons, especially in Texas.

       Writerâ€™s Digest Prompt, May 12, 2004:  Recall a nightmare you once had. Describe it. Analyze why you believe you had it.  When I was only 5 years old my family moved to Hesperia, California.  I remember being terrified to live in the desert, my uncle had told me that if I stepped foot outside of the car the snakes would eat me alive.  It was a mean thing to say to a child, and it stuck with me when moving day came.  Fear stricken, I reluctantly climbed outside of the car and to my pleasant surprise I wasnâ€™t eaten alive after all.  Maybe the desert wouldnâ€™t be so bad, after all.  Shortly after moving to the Mojave Desert I began to have a dream.  Darkness filled the sky in a strangely solid pitch black.  High rocks climbed toward the sky in hues of gray and brown and below where there would be a river, there was bubbling hot lava that stood red and contrasting to the blackness of the sky.  A black, clean highway ran through the rocks, with a long guardrail to protect the passing vehicles, except there were no passing cars.  There was nothing in sight, not people, animals, no cars, only the rocks climbing up and up, and myself.  Absently I climb to the top of the tall rocks and momentarily look over at the hot, bubbling liquid below, and then I jump.  I jump as if against my will, realizing my death only moments before plunging into the red heat.  Pain burns me to my bones as I sink wholly into the lava in one last screaming breath.  Then, to my ultimate surprise I float to the top, swim to the edge, climb back up the back of the rocks and jump, again.  The dreams continues, the same thing happening again and again.  Then I wake up, only the dreams memory to remind me.  I still have this dream 3 or 4 times a week, even now, even thought I donâ€™t live in the Desert anymore.  For the last 21 years I have been trying to figure out why.  When I was little, my mother used to take us over that pass through the rocks and into the valley beyond.  I remember that I was always frightened of the overpass â€“as I am scared of heights.  I believe, thinking back now, that the area had such a profound effect of fear on me that my mind exaggerated it and stored it into my subconscious.    The dream no longer scares me, it has just become a part of sleeping for me now.  Though it has come less frequently since I have moved to Texas, I still have it.  Itâ€™s as if the dream wonâ€™t let me forget my fear.

       English 1301 assignment; Write about a life changing event;   Have you heard to old clichÃ©, better late than never?  Having to describe the most significant experience in my life, I apply those four little words â€“better late than never.  In considering a life-changing event on which to write, returning to school has been inescapable.  While there have been many things in my life I consider life changing, going back to school is the most significant to the remainder of my years.  In my days to come, the education I will receive will be key to achieving the goals I have set forth for myself, in pursuit of a career as a novelist.  After graduating high school in the summer of 1996, I immediately began attending Victor Valley Junior College, in Victorville, California.  The fall 1996 semester found me half-heartedly seeking a college education I had little or no interest in pursuing.  At the request, and near insistence, of my parents I was reluctantly attending college.  They had agreed to pay for my tuition, fees, and books, as well as allowing me to remain living under their roof at no charge.  I think at this point I should say that as I had no interest in going to college, nor did I have any interest in undertaking any other productive venture.    Going to class when it was a convenient distraction or I had nothing better to do, I barely passed the first semester of college.  I continued to attend and continued to shirk my educational responsibilities never considering the financial investment my education was to my mother and father.  Then, in the fall of 1997, I began planning my wedding.  I was 19 years old and getting married, which left very little time for my schoolwork.  July 18, 1998 brought the happy â€“or not so happy- day, and by 6:00 pm I was Mrs. Michael Knight.  His lack of support for my education and my waning interest in attending college brought an eventual end to my sad college career not even two years after it began.  In those two years I had managed to earn less than 12 credits, my education had been going nowhere fast for a very long time.  Mike was a university student at the University of California at San Bernardino and his education proved to be more important than mine.  Dropping out of college and becoming a not so happy homemaker, I did not even look back at what I had lost in dropping out of college, nor did I care to. After a very rocky marriage, Michael and I divorced in June of 1999, ending an unhappy 11-month marriage.  Not long after filing for my divorce from Mike â€“which takes six months to complete in California- I met Matt.  Moving to Texas in late summer 1999 I started a relationship with Matt.  My divorce from Mike was final on January 16, 2000 and I married  Matt on February 14, 2000.    The consummate learner, Matt had decided to go back to school just before we married.  Following in his decision, I too decided to return to school. Giving school another shot after having dropped out the year before.  Matthew and I both began attending Texas State Technical College at Waco.  All was well for about one semester before I decided to call it quits yet again.  Matt was always supportive of whatever choices I decided to make, though he stayed in school.  For several long years I went to school on and off before I quit all together in the spring of 2002.    In May of 2003 I looked at my life, the fact that it had gone nearly nowhere and the weighing fact that I was about to turn 25 years old. I decided that it was finally time for me to do something to better my life.   With a knack for creative writing, but very poor grammar skills, I decided to go back to school to become a writer.  During my time away from school I had begun taking part in an online writing group.  This experience, coupled with my drive to return to school, and my husband Mattâ€™s support for my education, I returned to school at McLennan Community College in the summer of 2003. I have been attending McLennan Community College ever since.  I have remained in school for the past year, this summer semester marking a very important milestone in my life, my ability to stay in school.  I have also been accepted to the English program at Tarleton State University.  With my dreams of becoming a writer just around the corner, my drive to learn and become educated has increased phenomenally.    School has become a very important part of my life and will continue to be until I have finished my Bachelors degree.  My past struggle with school and my driving goal in life, coupled with my newfound extreme drive to learn, have made me understand that I have weathered a very important turning point in my life.  Going back to school has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. For years to come I will always regard this time in my life as most beneficial test of my limits and self-worth I have ever successfully passed.  While I will never claim that it has not been difficult, I am willing to wager that every hurdle has been worth twice it height in experience, experience that I would never trade.  Experience that I have found is better late than never.

        “What a strange thing memory is, and hope; one looks backward, the other forward. The one is of today, the other is the tomorrow. Memory is history recorded in our brain, memory is a painter, it paints pictures of the past and of the day.”  ~ Grandma Moses   I was thinking about my little sister this evening and I got to remembering when I was her age.  14 years old is such a carefree age!  Aside from the burden of getting the much needed education –which comes in handy when we get older- life was bubbles and cotton candy compared to what it means to be a “grown-up!”  When I was 14 years old I always thought it would be nice to be an adult, not to have parents to tell you what to do, when to go to bed, etc.  Now I realize that parents are the loving shelters that protect us from that nasty reality called age.  Parents are what keep us sane –and for God’s sake, safe- long enough to become a big bad 18 and older.    I gave my parents such a hard time growing up!  I wish I could take back all the agony I caused them daily.  I was a sassy, smartass bitch to my mother –now I realize that I wasn’t the hot shit I thought I was.  I didn’t know everything –or perhaps I did and I just forgot it all as I got older :).   I know that if I could go back, if I could be 14 again I would.  When you’re 14 years old your ignorant to life’s uglier side.  When your 14 years old you don’t know that you may grow-up, marry an asshole, and end up part of the nations largest statistic, Divorce –at least I know I didn’t.  When you’re 14 years old you don’t understand bills or hunger, or what you parents go through trying to make ends meet and even though every 14 year old may think that they suffered “depression” few actually know what that word means until they grow-up.    The worst mistake I ever made was to take my family for granted.  When I was a little girl, a teenager, my family was a good family.  Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my parents and Candace –and even Staci sometimes :) - but I was a rotten little brat.  Now I know some who have had the worst families imaginable, fathers who abandon them and leave them to fend for themselves in a children’s home.  Now I know people with alcoholic parents and parents who would neglect them for another joint, how lucky I was to have a hardworking mother and father who loved me and would never abandon me.  Stupid little girls my sister and I were, and I see now.  But my little sister, Candace is not.  Candace is a good girl –at least most of the time.  She does her work and is always there for my mom.  She’s a smart kid, a truly smart kid.  Oh, to be 14 again!  ~Kristyn

       “The act of acting morally is behaving as if everything we do matters.” ~ Gloria Steinem   I think I may have the world’s most ethically stubborn husband!  I have to smile when I consider his conviction on certain issues and his apathy to others.  Greed, Capitalism, Politics, Religion, and of course the every advancing world of Technology.  It seems at times that he is passionate about the most fragile of subjects, at all times.  Recently they passed a “Public Smoking Ban” in Waco and he freaked out.  Ranted about his Civil Liberties and I agreed with him –and not for the first time.  Now, he is boycotting any restaurant that will not allow smoking.  I commend him for standing up for what he believes in, it’s more than most would do.  Tonight we were talking about a rather big court case gone awry.  Matt is strictly against pirating –music, movies, you name it, if its pirated he hates it!  I have never seen any problems with people burning CD’s and he has.  It has always been an issue that we had to agree to disagree on until tonight.  When getting into the finer points of the effects of pirating, I think I have to take his side on this one.  He explained it like this: “For everything we purchase we are casting a vote.  If we buy a Metallica CD new from Hastings we are voting for their continued career.”  I understood but still he wasn’t getting through to me.  After a long discussion I came to the realization that Pirating is socially depleting.  Every pirated CD is a stolen item, which makes the new ones worth less.    In the end he was right and I wrong.  He should revel in his victory on this issue, it doesn’t happen very often!    Which coincidentally got me thinking I have always been interest in ethical issues.  What constitutes “unethical” these days?  Ethics is a personal decision and should be one made while taking into consideration the rights and laws of the world –both written and unwritten, spoken and unspoken.    For me, Religion and law dictate my morals and ethics, then on personal views.  This is not always so for everyone. I guess there is no real answer to the question: “What constitutes unethical?”  Dictionary.com defines unethical as: 1: not conforming to approved standards of social or professional behavior. 2: not adhering to ethical or moral principles.  If unethical is not conforming to standards, then who set’s those standards?  Is it the right of the government in this country to tell each person what they should believe and how to live their lives. If so then I jump on the boat and sail out to never-never land with Henry David Thoreau… but I digress, if I live in a country of freedom of thought then Thoreau is for the birds.  Then I wonder if that is the case then how is dictionary.com possibly right about what unethical is?  ~Kristyn

       “God gives us our relatives; thank God we can choose our friends.” ~ Ethel Watts Mumford   I believe that friendships are a truly rare gift from God.  Still I have not always had much luck forging lasting friendships - it’s a curse indeed.  Lately I have been thinking, wondering why we forge friendships at all?  It had occurred to me that friends –while being a gift from God- could often be a painful and trying bunch.  Something happened recently that tried the bonds of friendship and threatened to unravel our morals.  A matter of keeping a secret told by one, without allowing that secret to hurt another.  I realized that some friends are truly wolves in sheep’s clothing, lurking in the night doing their very best to steal the trust of a poor unwitting soul.   How can someone who has been your friend for so very long plot behind your back with another supposed friend to betray you?  Is a friendship not a bond that serves to protect and nurture and watch over one another through thick and thin?  Perhaps I have the wrong idea of friendship and that is why I have been so unsuccessful at forging them at times in the past.    Still morals aside, the true friend chosen by time and deed, it will all come out in the wash as my mom says.  Wise woman!   It occurred to me most recently that true friends –those who you know will not betray you; Matt, Emily, Jennifer & Chris, Terry & Kindra- are worth every second of having to deal with the others, those who are not true friends but rather torturous painful lurkers in friends clothing.  Those who are true friends are the reason that we forge friendships, because in the end it is those few souls you can call true friends who come through for you.  It is those few souls who give meaning to the word friendship!  ~Kristyn

      Who do you suppose really “invented the Internet?”  Now I know that there was this nasty little rumor going around that Al Gore “invented” the Internet –started by him of all people- but that is simply not the fact!  The Internet is a beautiful creature that infests itself in our homes and grows on us to the point that we can hardly live with out it.  The Internet is a brilliant near life form, a near life form that allows us to talk to people across the country, across the world, or just next door with relative ease.  The Internet allows women to meet their dream man from half way across the country, from the comfort of their own living rooms. Something so innovative and for God sake, damn brilliant couldn’t have come from Al Gore –Its just not possible!  While we’re on the topic of Al Gore, I have a few things to say. How is it that in America a brilliant man who can run a country and a war but can’t spell Potato (If you haven’t caught on I’m talking about Dan Quale) can be criticized and made into a the bud of a million and one political –and otherwise- jokes. Then an ignorant prick like Al Gore could nearly win the presidency.  It must be some democratic conspiracy to completely screw up America.  Could you imagine Al Gore trying to conduct this War: “Give up Sadam, you have another 8 years to do disarm.  Take you time, and you better do it or I’ll say do it again!” or maybe: “There are more important issues. Now, you -send that crate of arms to the middle east, you- send that crate of weapons to Korea, you -round up all the cuban kids and send them home at gun point, and you –get me a prostitute.”  Hmmm… I think this is what’s called a tangent, sorry.  I think I got a bit off the topic…  … Internet, is it just me or is they’re more and more people meeting their spouses on the Internet.  My sister and her husband met online –I’m not saying that a good thing, especially since he’s such a huge prick- but they met there none the less.  I met my husband online and we couldn’t be happier.  Our friend Chris met a really cool girl through the Internet –granted it was a mixed up, round about way- and they ended up married.  Even my fourteen-year-old sister has two guy friends online.  It seems to me that Internet predators are getting more and more rare.  Now I’m not saying that they don’t exist and I am also not saying that don’t feel for those people who have been struck with the tragedy of Internet predators.  I’m just saying that people are getting more and more careful now a days.     Internet allows me to stay in touch with a friend who moved away in the 10th grade.  It also allow’s me to stay in touch with my family 1,500 miles away.  So who really invented the Internet?  ~Kristyn

       “With fame I become more and more stupid, which of course is a very common phenomenon."  ~ Albert Einstein   Of all the things in the world I am beginning to believe that our once beautiful –even educated- world is being completely taken over by this curse so dubbed “Reality TV!”   Who in the hell came up with this idea?!  This horrible, mind-numbing, brain-rotting, suicide TV!  So I have to admit that I was once a fan of this media craze, too. I even find myself trying to rationalize it and defend it to my husband who is determined that “Reality TV” is going to be the end of civilization as we know it.  Then I saw this, urlLink  “MR. PERSONALITY"  coming soon to FOX television.   First problem, its reality TV -which seems to get dumber and dumber by the season. Second, it’s hosted by Monica Lewinsky –how does giving the president head make you qualified to host a reality series?  Now I have no problems with Monica Lewinsky, I would even endeavor to say that I am a bit fascinated with her in some ways, but come on she is a bit overeducated for such a lowly position, don’t you think?  Between ‘Temptation Island’ –which I can honestly say intrigued me- and ‘The Bachelor’, ‘The Bachlorette’, ‘Joe Millionaire’, ‘Who want’s to Marry a Millionaire’ and ‘Married by America’, ‘The sexiest people in America’ and who can forget ‘American Idol’ our country is turning into an invariable laughing stock of wanna-be’s and desperate pathetic jerks who cant act!  Oh and I nearly forgot the unbearable ‘Survivor’!  What is this world coming to, I mean really coming to?  If there were life out there, in the stars and they were watching us right now they would pass us by for invasion looking for a more intelligent race!  I long for the days when television was purely fiction and people read books rather than rotting their brains and lowering their IQ’s with this drivel we call “Reality TV.”  So I wonder if it could get any worse than a television show about a desperate woman and 20 “eligible” bachelors in masks making out on national TV for one hour a week.  Every season I wonder if it could get any worse, any dumber, and for goodness sake any more desperate and every season I am surprised –unhappily- with the idiotic programming they come out with.   Then I wonder what terrible thing happened in their pasts to cause these seemingly normal –under other circumstances, of course- people to subject themselves to the demoralization of “Reality TV”?  What utterly pathetic lives must these people live to parade around in front of the world as lonely and desperate!  I am beginning to think this is something beyond the understanding of anyone with an IQ over 5o –though I know better!   Now don’t get me wrong, I can understand that some people like it.  I can even try to respect that –like I said, I used to watch it back when it was new and exciting.  Some Americans want to come home after a long hard day of work and not have to think about anything and for them I say: “Watch your Reality TV and enjoy it!”  for it is truly those that place themselves before the world in the most humiliating circumstance possible for their 15 minutes of fame who I pity, not the viewers!  ~Kristyn

        “I think knowing what you can not do is more important than knowing what you can do. In fact, that’s good taste."  ~ Lucille Ball   I truly believe that time is an invaluable thing.  The worth of our lives is judged in the end by the things we did and the time we spent doing them.  The great clock of life just ticking away every second of everyday, making each of us a day older –and not necessarily a day wiser.  Lately I feel like time eludes me, evades me even.  There are so many things I want to do; read –I have a stack of like 10 books and growing on the agenda.  Game, a pass-time that I thoroughly enjoy, work on my ever-needing web-site, write, do some puzzles, etc.  Somehow, in a day where I want to get everything done, I seem to get nothing done at all.  It’s almost like my days only consist of 12 hours instead of 24.  It’s getting almost depressing!  Everyday I wake up hoping to get to everything I want to do and instead I do nearly nothing and wonder where my time has gone. Though this had been my woe for some time now, in the last day or so I have been feeling a bit better about the situation.  I have had time to game and work on my web-site, and write my posting for the PBeM’s I sim for.    Now, when I wake up everyday I feel regret for the things I will not do.  The things I will neglect or push aside, I feel regret for the books I don’t finish –day in and day out. All in all, someday’s I wake up feeling like a total failure, before the day had even begun.  Depressing to say the very least!  When all is finally said and done, I hope that I can find a better use for my time, better organization perhaps.  Then when I am old, I won’t feel like my life was for not.  ~ Kristyn

        “People create their own questions because they’re afraid to look straight. All you have to do is look straight and see the road, and when you see it, don’t sit looking at it –walk.”   ~ Ayn Rand    Morals; motivation based on ideas of right and wrong. Ethics; A set of principles of right conduct. In my life I have made some mistakes.  I have lived immorally, treated myself like shit, given in to temptation on more than one occasion, and not always followed the word of God.  So I suppose you could say that while I do now have a sense of moral and ethical right and wrong in my own mind and within my chosen actions, that hasn’t always been so.  However, since gaining that strong sense of my own moral mind I have grown very aware of how each and every action will affect my moral beliefs.  I am unwilling to compromise!  Okay let me get on with it, most recently I have been asked to do something that I felt was morally and ethically wrong.  The obvious answer to the question would be no, except in this case it took some thought.  In this case, violating my own moral beliefs would have given a friend the opportunity to live a better life and get a better job.  Violating my own moral beliefs would have seen that she could make more money, get some much needed insurance, and generally be a happier person.  All of these being true, I had to put a great deal of thought into this particular predicament.   When is it right to knowingly and with forethought violate your own moral and ethical beliefs?  I personally believe that the answer to this question is, never.  I personally believe that if you pick and choose what to spend and break your morality on, you will loose a sense of why you adhere to morals at all.  In the case of my friend, I decided that I would not do her that favor she required to make her life better.  I know it may sound cruel, but I choose to adhere to my morals.  If she had lived her life in correlation with her own morals and ethics –or even knew what she morally believed for that matter- then she wouldn’t have been in the predicament to begin with.  If she had lived by mans law, or in accordance with her own health and safety, she wouldn’t have been in that predicament.  So in the end it came down to weather or not I was willing to give in and break my morals to make up for a series of bad choices on her part.    Another problem was, once I cut through all the bullshit, that I knew that if I did this one favor for her, if I helped her out, nothing would change.  She would go on doing that thing that got her into the predicament to begin with, and other lives could suffer for her problem.  Again I was unwilling to risk others for her problem.    In the end I said no to helping her, and hopefully she will not ask me again in the future.  Still I hope that our friendship has not been strained by this decision, if it has and she is unwilling to understand that I had to do what I thought was ethically right, then perhaps she was not the friend I believed her to be in the first place.  ~Kristyn

        "A critic is someone who never actually goes to the battle, yet who afterward comes out shoothing the wounded."   ~Tyne Daly  "Any critic is entitled to wrong judgements, of course.  But certain lapses of judgementindicate the radical failure of an entire sensibility."   ~Susan Sontag   Most recently I have found that Communication is more important that I thought it was.  Now don’t get me wrong, being married shows you just how much communications means to any surviving relationship –romantic or merely friends alike.  When speaking to a number of people over the Internet I have realized that there is one unmistakable truth, never say too much! Especially when those people turn around and tell others.    I take part in a PbeM on the net –several actually.  Recently there has been a HUGE miscommunication that lead to one of our command players stepping down.  Things were said, feelings were hurt, and in the end rumor served no one.  Criticism ruined his pleasurable experiance with our group and for that I am deeply saddened.  I think I realize now that making sure that you are not misrepresented by yourself –or anyone else online- is like playing the old party game “Telephone.”  You tell someone something, they turn around and tell someone else, that person relates it to another, and so on.  Soon something as simple as “I would take the job if he were to step down” turns into “Everyone hates you and Kristyn is ‘gunning’ for you job.”  Oh the hurt feelings!  I just wish I understood why things always turned out that way.  Can’t anything so simple stay so simple?  I suppose not.    “The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend.  Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again.”  The Immortal words of the great Robert Jordan.  Okay, so I am being only the slightest bit dramatic.  Still when things turn into such a mess, and feelings are hurt, eventually they will be forgotten by all but the one person who was hurt the most.  I suppose the politics are always there, behind everything that is good and fun lurks an evil imp that seeks to destroy someone.  Trying to avoid being that one is the tricky part.  I think that imp also preys on the language barrier.  In different countries, things are precieved differently.  I do however believe that this proverbial imp is not necessarily a person but rather a dark though or radical criticism at the wrong time and expressed to the wrong person.  Still, all being said and true.  I think that in the end no one ever meant to hurt anyone else, it just happens.  Inevitably, beyond reason, feeling, friendship, or fun, someone always ends up hurt in the end.  So I believe that if every person in the world would just take one day and try their hardest to not criticize or hurt anyone else the world would be much better for the effort.  ~Kristyn

       “Dreams are…illustrations from the book your soul is writing about you." ~ Marsha Norman   Isn’t it strange the places were we find inspiration?  Dreams, driving down the road, right in the middle of a great movie, but never, EVER right when you want or need them.  Never when you’re near a computer, or paper.  Never when you want or need to just sit down and write.    Since I was a little girl, 5 years old or so, I have been having the same nightmare –3 or more times a week.  I have had this particular nightmare so many times that it doesn’t even frighten me anymore.  The dream begins on a particularly high, rocky overpass with high guardrails –a place where I grew up in California.  There is no traffic, the road is empty, no buildings in the distance as there would normally be, not a single soul but myself –I am completely alone.  All around me is pitch, the blackness of the sky is the loneliest thing I have ever felt and despair washes over me as I stand there looking over the guardrail.  The rocky hills all around the overpass are illuminated and below them where the river would normally be there is hot, bubbling lava.  The heat of it nearly makes me swoon and trying to escape its heat I climb to the highest point on the rocks.  When I get there the Lava is nearly as deep as the road where I stood by the guardrail and I am compelled to jump, jump from the rocks into the hot, bubbly liquid.  So I jump, let all caution go to the wind and when my body is emerged in the painful, hot lava I am not consumed.  The immense pain drives me to swim the best I can to the edge and pull myself over the guardrail and back onto the road.  Looking over, the lava has shrunk to the size of a small river and again I am compelled to climb the rocks and launch myself from them.  Again I climb from the hot liquid, and the dream starts again.  Never had I told this to a soul who has not looked at me strangely.  Never have I been able to find any sort of interpretation for the aspects of this dream in a book, or on the web.  Still I continue to have it, every few nights, and I fear I always will.  Personally I believe it come from a fear of heights, and a fear of that particular place from a very young age. Yet who could say and while it IS MY dream, it is fairly illusive to me –I am no expert on this matter, not by a long shot!  I was talking to a friend a few days ago who told me that he had been having the same series’ of nightmares since he was a little boy.  Maybe I am not so alone in this as I believed.  Yet I am also discouraged every time I wake from that dream and wonder if I will have it forever.    ~Kristyn

         “Freedom of speech and freedom of action are meaningless without freedom to think. And there is no freedom of thought without doubt.”  ~Bergen Evans The Natural History of Nonsense    I wrote a blog a few days ago ranting and raving about the evils of the  urlLink Center for Bio-Ethical Reform  .  Now I feel that I should explain myself a bit more on that matter.  While I believe it is truly repulsive to see such images on the sides of trucks in restaurant parking lots, I believe its both in bad taste and give Republicans and Christians a bad name.  These things are true, but not the only problem I have with such images.  America is a country where anyone can say anything and get away with it, freedom of speech its called and I love this right as much as the next guy, but I think there should be a point where we draw the line.    Let me explain; in this country we rate movies G-R and even NC-17 or X.  These ratings keep children from viewing content that would be inappropriate for their age.  We also have people who read books and decide weather they are inappropriate for school libraries and good books get banned because someone didn’t like them.  What a shame then that literature is restricted to children and so are movies, but content on billboards and the side of trucks are not.  How is it different for a child to see an R rated movie where people are being killed and seeing the side of a truck with a HUGE aborted fetus upon it?  In my eyes there is not difference at all.    So why is it that these little things slip through with the right to scream “Freedom of Speech” and works of literature don’t?  Has this little thing slipped through our legislation?  Who gave these people the right to show such grotesque images in public for all eyes to see?  I can’t help feeling like they are preaching to the choir so to speak.  People who oppose abortion already believe that its wrong with out having to see it splayed out all over town, and people who believe in abortion are not going to be moved to a change in disposition or belief just by seeing something so grotesque.    In the end, when all is said and done, there will still be the trucks with the large pictures of death, there will still be protesters and billboards with images that are unfit for the public eye.  Simply put, someone with a bad attitude had something to say.  ~Kristyn

        "Thinking men cannot be ruled."  ~Ayn Rand   While sitting on the sofa across from Matt one afternoon, watching Sci-fi, I saw one of the most interesting thing I have seen in a while.  A show called “In Search Of…” which shows a variety of strange and sometimes utterly unbelievable things did a segment on Psychic Spies.  At first I just pushed it aside, dismissing it for complete and total bullshit –then I watched it, and looked into it more and I am not so sure anymore.  Something I didn’t know was that the US Military uses Psychic Spies, using a technique called Remote Viewing, to spy on foreign governments during times of war –its all very hush hush! Shaking my head I watched as this young man –a Remote Viewing Student- spied on a woman who had been planted in Los Angeles as a test of his skill.  He began to sketch using images he had gotten using an ESP technique and when all was said and done he had sketched –to nearly exact detail- the place where this young woman had been planted.    That’s when I had to swallow my pride and go look it up.  Apparently there are a number of organizations devoted to teaching Remote Viewing to any and every interested party. They even have an association,  urlLink International Remote Viewing Association (IRVA) .    While I will still not hold out its authenticity, I thought it was something to think on.  Something to look up and with all the organizations devoted to its existence, something to take a bit more seriously.    ~Kristyn

         “I would not attack the faith of a heathen without being sure I had a better one to put in its place.” ~ Harriet Beecher Stowe   It wasn’t long ago that I came out of a restaurant after eating lunch and saw a truck, a normal moving style truck except that on the side, in vivid color was the image of an aborted fetus, broken and mutilated in the gloved palms of a human being.  The images took the entire side of the truck –on all sides and in tiny black print there was a web address for  urlLink The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform .  I nearly lost my lunch at the sight of this truck sitting in the parking lot of a restaurant, then I wanted to cry, third I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs at whom ever would be so deranged as to drive such a thing, let-alone park it in a place where children would see it.  Now I will tell you that I am not an advocate for Abortion, I believe that its wrong to take a life, especially a life that has not the ability to choose to be born in the first place and certainly doesn’t have the ability to choose death.  I believe in God and while I believe that a woman should have the right to choose everything else about herself, that is not one of them –no matter the circumstance.  There are other choices to be made, adoption for one.  Still that is just my opinion and not one that I try to force on anyone!  Okay, now back to the topic.  I endeavored to try to understand why such a thing would exist.  When I went to their website I only got angry.  A high and mighty organization who endeavors to tell others how to live and results to scare tactics.  Disgusted I spent many hours contemplating this organization’s purpose and what they must be thinking, I came up with only anger.  These groups give all Christians and Republicans a bad name.  Organizations like this one make us all look like crazed, picketing, take a stand for whatever is good today, type of people, and all in the name of God!    The lord provides us all with freewill from the moment of our birth, I only believe it’s a shame to waste it on this ignorance.  The lord is a forgiving, loving god and slinging brimstone at anyone YOU don’t like defies the entire purpose of faith in God.  Sometimes I think its not a wonder that the lord drowned everyone in the world once, and sometimes I believe that it’s a shame that Jesus choose to give his life for such ignorance.  I thank God for the sacrifice of his son, for without them I would never know forgiveness like I do now –even thought I feel unworthy of his sacrifice, I thank him none the less.   I only have one thing to say, “Love thy brother” and I do not consider this radical group loving!    ~Kristyn

        "When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are, everything your heart desires will come to you." ~Disney   Fairytales.  Why is it that when we are little girls we are told that Prince Charming does exist, that life is what you make of it, and that everything will turn out happy and shiny in you want it to?  I got to thinking about this question and wondered if this was a malicious ploy on the part of our mothers to give us false hope about how adulthood, life, and love would really be.  Or perhaps it was a loving, sheltering plot on he part of our mothers to protect us from the truth until it was absolutely necessary to let us in on the real truth. The real truth that life is not all peaches’n’cream, shit does happen, and not matter how badly you want that fairytale you read about in Sleeping Beauty as a child and eventually bride magazines when your older- nothing is ever so simple!  I have grown to understand this one defining factor, when you grow up, life is not all never never land anymore and you can never go back, you can never make the choices you made again so choose carefully.  You can never go back and change the fact that you married the wrong guy the first time, or that you ate an entire box of twinkies.  Life is what you make of it, but only to a certain extent.  Isn’t it true that if you are one half of a relationship, it is not completely your decision how your life will turn out?  When you get shacked-up, engaged, married, etc. with a person they will inevitably choose what your life will be like and you will choose what theirs will be.  So I say, careful who you marry they’re not that easy to get rid of once the ring is sealed with an, I do and a kiss.    Then there’s the question of what is important.  If you can not live with your significant –and sometimes not so significant- other’s quirks, then don’t try.  If you’re the cleanest person in the entire universe and your hubby is a slob and doesn’t care, then think about that before you get married.  No matter what the propaganda machine has told you, you CAN NOT live on LOVE ALONE!  Its just a viscous lie made up by those who could never actually find love the hard way and want to trick someone into their trap before it too late.  For me, I think that it was a matter of outweighing the bad shit with what was really important.  When I got married the first time I married a guy who was somewhat neat –especially since I cleaned up after him, Ironed his clothes, cooked his meals, etc.- and tidy, somewhat responsible –always getting the bills paid on time- and somewhat caring –at least in the beginning.  He turned out to be a cold, mean, jerk who treated me like a slave and didn’t give two shits weather I was happy.  My first husband was somewhat intelligent –he graduated High School with honors and since I divorced him he has graduated college with 2 Bachelor’s degrees.  Still all that pomp’n’circumstance didn’t make him smart.  He was overall, not the right guy for me.    So when I divorced his sorry ass, I decided I would NEVER marry again, yeah right!  Now I am married for the second time and when considering weather I should marry him or not, it pretty much came down to what was important to me.  I want a guy who is truly smart –not one how fakes it like my ex, Mike.  I wanted a guy who was sweet –not a cold fish who only cared about himself; again like my ex, Mike.  I wanted someone I could talk to and share myself with, someone who would support my every whim as if it were a life changing occurrence (you never know when they will be with me) –still very unlike my selfish, ME ME ME, ex-husband.  I wanted to be with someone who could put up with my attitude (believe me when I say that was important) with a passing interest and not get offended –so unlike my ex it wasn’t funny!  When I found all of those things in one guy, when I found all of those things in Matt, I realized that in order to have all that good, sometimes you have to decide if it was worth the bad quirks.  I realized that most of the bad quirks were just that, quirks, superficial quirks and not something that I would nit-pick at.  Other than his need to never pick up after himself and not care, and his smoking, there wasn’t much else I saw that was bad.  So I went to the altar, got married and I have never regretted it a day.  Now don’t get me wrong its no fairytale, what ever are these days.  But it’s about as close to perfect as I ever want to come.  Sometime you have to find the fairytale in life; they don’t always come to you.  Sometime you have to do some looking to find that one rose in a bed of thorns bushes.  In my case I can honestly say that my prince charming has come, perhaps in disguise, but has come none the less.    ~Kristyn

        "Cyberspace: A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation."  ~William Gibson    Internet Weirdo's are everywhere!  I don't think you could ever possibly imagine how many there are these days.  It amazes me how some people can be so damned weird to people they just met.  I suppose that it has something to do with the lack of personal, face to face, conversation.  Almost anyone could be on the other side of that computer and Internet weirdoes don’t give a damn.    Take for example my mom was talking to a guy who was getting married and wanted sex advice for his wedding night, and another guy who told her he was into all sorts of weird things.  These were guys she just stumbled upon while playing on Y! games, and started talking to her.  I told her if she was uncomfortable about being hit on by the weird guys on Yahoo that she should only play with other women, you cannot imagine what she said next, “They’re all lesbians, YUCK!”    So I have to say that I met my husband on the Internet and I WOULD NOT recommend this to anyone.  Now don’t get me wrong, It turned out great and he is a great guy.  Still I must have been out of my mind to meet a guy I met on the Internet!  I realize now that he could have been an ax murderer for all I knew.    My sister met her man on the Internet and when I look at them I realize that I could have gotten a super strange JACKASS like the guy she got, and I cringe!  Her husband is a controlling, drama-queen of a man who will never amount to anything but upstate New York trailer trash.  He and I DO NOT get along and I never intend for that to get any better.  He is an Internet weirdo and she doesn’t even realize it.    So in the end, it all amounts to what the person on the other end of the line is willing to put up with.  Remember all you have to do is “sign-off.”  ~Kristyn

        "He who lives in solitude may make his own laws."  ~ Publilius Syrus    Superficial loss; I think that superficial loss is the single most difficult thing for the human mind to comprehend.  When we loose our keys, chances are we are going to find them, this is not the sense of loss I am talking about.  I’m talking about that sense of loss that could have been prevented, that sense of loss that could have been stopped or detoured.  Senseless, superficial loss, nothing so dramatic as death and yet I have been thinking that this is a day to day thing in the world.    For example, when we loose a friend –a topic I have come to be an expert on- that friend can never be replaced.  Sure we will always get other friends –hopefully- but that friend who left our lives cannot ever be replaced.  Now again I am not talking about death or anything so dramatic, I only mean the sort of superficial, needless loss that exists when a friendship breaks-up or grows apart.  When a friend moves away, chances are you and she/he are going to grow apart.    Now I suppose it isn’t always so glum.  I have a friend, a girl I have known since the 7th grade and who moved away in the 10th grade.  We are still friends, now nearly 10 years since she moved.  We correspond, weather by the miracle of email or by what has come to be known as “snail-mail.”  We send on another pictures and such every so often.  So I suppose that its not all doom and gloom, but still she and I are no as close as we were in school, before she moved.    The Internet and “snail-mail” are fine and well but there lacks a sense of personal contact, again I shake my head and say; “Superficial loss.”    Now, there exists a world where it is no longer necessary for a person to leave their homes for friendship and companionship.  It is no longer necessary to go out and make friends, hell it’s hardly necessary to have any friends in flesh, so to speak.  Now we live in a world where anyone can have a friend for the $30.00 –I have a cable modem- a month everyone pays for the Internet.  To me this is a whole new sense of superficial loss.  It is the superficial loss of personal companionship.  How sad.  I suppose that I all of this talk has been brought about by the fact that a friend of mine –my best friend for the past 3 ½ years just moved away.  I suppose it was bound to happen some time, either that or I would have had to move, but I still feel the sense of loss for the whole situation.  I suppose its because I don’t make friends very easily and I like to hold onto the one’s I have, or perhaps it’s because she and I were close friends, we both moved to town about the same time and neither of us knew a single soul –save my husband.  It all just strikes me as very, very sad.  Yet it is a situation that could not be helped right now.  So hopefully she will move back, or I will go see her.  I am going to have to refuse to let this situation result in superficial loss.  ~Kristyn

        “The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.”  ~ Aristotle    School is that one constant thing in the lives of millions around the globe that will promise a better future for the world we now live it.  Tomorrow’s genius’s and leaders, inventors, and only the lord knows what else.  School, from your local Jr. College to tech school, to the $16,000 a semester it costs to go to Baylor University –that’s a flat rate from what I hear- school is that thing that drives our world forward, with promises of a better tomorrow.    So why, when school is so damned important to the world’s future, are so many states raising the roof on the cost of learning?  Deregulating tuition, I know that the Jr. College I go to is about to have a hike in tuition from the modest $170.00 (approx.) a semester hour to something like $225.00 a semester hour.  When did the cost of knowing, learning, and growing as a person get so large?  Whose idea was this?    The future is not looking so good, when you run all those with the drive to learn out of school for lack of the ability to pay the overpriced, exorbitant cost of a few classes here and there, what are we left with?  McDonalds and Dairy Queen, maybe –if you’re extremely lucky- you will learn a trade that will be useful for years to come.  Otherwise, learning is on the downswing.  I ask this, when did learning become a fad?  I live in a state that preaches EDUCATION!!! Cry’s its praises from the roof tops, good ol’ Texas!  Still, when it comes down to it, I wonder what they are doing to back that up?  Its Texas who is deregulating college tuition, giving colleges the right to charge what they want, which makes all us popper’s who can’t afford it scowl in disbelief.  Now don’t get me wrong, I love the state of Texas.  They were one of the firsts to enact testing to be able to graduate High School.  While this may be true, I find myself shaking my head, other countries –including the quite scandalous France- have been testing their students for years.  In the end I am left with a bitter taste in my mouth for legislators, their overpaid salaries, and Mercedes in the drive.  If they did what they were supposed to do, fight for the people, they would never be deregulating college tuition.  They would be mindful of the future of the world.  Without students –a population that decreases steadily by the year- the future will be dim.  ~Kristyn

         "In politics if you want anything said, ask a man.  If you want anything done, ask a woman."  ~Margaret Thatcher    While surfing the net yesterday, looking up the urlLink  Republican Party  website –I figured what the hell since I decided to rant about it in my last blog.  Anyway, in the process I found this great sight for women called urlLink  Winning Women.   It’s a republican website that promotes the uprising of female politicians.  It’s an initiative by George W. Bush to get more women involved in the one place they have always been taboo: Washington.    I personally believe that what this world needs is more strong, positive female influences.  Girls need more strong, intelligent, independent women to look up to.  Now, women are coming on stronger and stronger in the political scene.  Take Condoleeza Rice for example, her charisma is unrivaled and she is about as positive as they come, in my humble opinion.  There is also Laura Bush, who is a very well known and positive influence on young women.   Still, where there is good there is inevitably bad.  Take for instance Hillary Clinton, who has to be the worst female roll model in the world.  Her views are frighteningly liberal in all the wrong ways.  Less of her is what this world needs, less of all the Clintons!  It’s a great site, positive for women in every way!  ~Kristyn

        “Neither conservatives nor humorists believe man is good. But left-wingers do.”  ~ P.J. O’Rourke   I believe that the need to excel is one of the most basic human instincts.  Still, I wonder why that is not present in society?  Has a need to be more than we were born as, or to be, breed out of society by a lack of ambition and Welfare?  Have we grown too dependent on the system to pick ourselves up and become something?  I’m taking ‘Texas Government’ this summer.  The class is boring to say the very least, and to compound that, it’s LONG, 6pm –10pm two nights a week.  However boring it may be, I still listen to most of the gibberish that comes out of my flaming liberal professor’s ramblings –and they are ramblings, trust me!  For a man who cannot seem to put two sentences together to make an intelligible thought, he seems to have too many unfounded opinions for his own damned good most of the time.  Over and over he has insulted the urlLink  republican party  and stomped on its beliefs with little or no real understanding of what the party even stands for –leave it to a liberal not to do his homework.  For goodness sake, the man is a Government teacher and I would expect him to know something about government, HA!    I can’t count on both hands how many times he has said, “for all of you cold nosed republicans, who don’t care about anyone and believe that everyone should just make their own way, Congratulations!  Welfare is being cut in Texas, so you should be real proud of yourselves!”  Now is it just me or is that complete bullshit.  The man is a teacher, he didn’t sign up to teach this class so he could force his own moral and “compassionate” beliefs on all of us stone cold republicans.    Every man is entitled to his opinions, in my opinion.  If he hates us republicans for believing in the human spirit and believing that men have enough in them to stand on their own two feet –that is the only place where they will find true happiness and achieve their goals after all- that is his right.  I only ask that he doesn’t spend the grueling 4 hours we are forced to sit in that class, telling us all about it.  Leave your opinions at the door and teach us the facts. Is that too much to ask?  What is so damned wrong with believing that men should support themselves and not live on the system?  What is so wrong with believing that every person in this world could have a great purpose if they would seek it, and what is so damned wrong with being a little cold toward the idea of people who live off the government.  Welfare –social programs, like checks and food stamps, among others- rot away at out society as a whole and eat away government dollars.  Get a job!  ~Kristyn

       “True, we love life, not because we are used to living, but because we are used to loving. There is always some madness in love, but there is also always some reason in madness.”  ~ Friedrich Nietzsche    Have you ever looked back at your life and scoffed at your past, and your ability to get through the then “overwhelming odds” which now look like a speed bump rather than a racetrack. I remember the things I have gone through and done in my past, and its almost like I am looking back on my life then with a vision of now, and what I see is someone entirely different.  There were the times when I thought that I just couldn’t go on, or I just couldn’t get past… whatever it was at the time.  What a load of crap, complete and utter crap!    An example would be my divorce from my first husband –wow, that makes me look bad, so just for clarification sake I have only been divorced ONCE and that was more than enough for me!  When I tried to leave my first husband, he wouldn’t let me go.  He did everything he could to hold on and all I wanted was to be free.  The jerk acted as if the idea of getting a divorce came out of the blue and hit him like a ton of bricks, and the fact is that it didn’t.  So why is it that people only hear what they want to hear?    That is a problem in my life even now.  My Husband Matt and I get along great!  We seldom fight or argue, and when we do its mostly just senseless bickering and nothing serious to worry about.  Then there are those times when I just want to kill him, and I am sure he feels the same.  Take for example the “fight” we had on Monday night.  I made comment about going out and getting something to eat on the way back from feeding my in-law’s cat.  He said okay, but misunderstood me to mean I wanted take-out.  I didn’t say that, but that is what he got from it.  I suppose he was feeling game deprived so after a long day of school he wanted me to GM (Game Master) for him.  All I wanted was to eat in a restaurant.  We got into a huge fight over the Lord knows what now and we didn’t talk to each other for like 20 minutes, yep the unbearable “I’m not about to be the first one to speak” silent treatment came next.    Now the background of that fight is this.  The city we live in just banned smoking in restaurants.  He feels that this is an infringement of his rights and that its unethical and immoral to tell him that he can’t do something that is perfectly legal in a public place. So he is taking his stand and not eating in ANY restaurants that DO NOT allow smoking, which is all of them now.  I feel like his stand is not only punishing “society” but is also punishing me, who doesn’t smoke and would like to have dinner in a restaurant once in a while.  I suppose I can understand his “Stand” but I still think its crazy!    You know, I was thinking that maybe I should take a “stand” of my own.  He won’t eat in restaurants and he can not cook.  Maybe I should stop cooking for him, or buying groceries, because he smokes in the house and I feel that it’s immoral and unethical for him to kill me with his second hand smoke.  After all why should I have to die for his habit?  Now I realize that two wrongs don’t make a right and that would never work. He would just start getting take-out for himself and none for me, my plan would backfire and I would go hungry!  I also realize that taking a stand like that against your own husband is relationship suicide, but I have considered a strike on more than one occasion.    So there you have it, the troubles of the world, or my world at least all bottled up into one scenario about eating at restaurants.  It’s a bit pathetic I know, but hey that’s life!  ~Kristyn

        “Nowhere in the Bible does it say, 'Thou shalt not think'.”  ~ Matthew Hammond   Today I was enlightened.  Matt and I were talking about theories of reality, we were theorizing where Heaven and, consequently, Hell exist.  What we came up with was the possibility that Heaven and Hell exist in an “alternate” place.  When we are children in Sunday school we are taught that Heaven is in the sky and Hell is in the ground. It becomes obvious that that is as metaphorical as everything else in the bible, still it exists, as a good way to teach children the distinction between our religious places of good and evil.  So, if we don’t dance on the clouds when were good and sink to the pits of fire within the earth when we die, where do we go? I suppose the answer is that no one still living really knows –even though there are those who claim to know based on “near-death” experiences, which I will get to in a little while.  I asked Matt, “Do you believe that when we die, we gain all the knowledge of the universe?”  To that he answered, “If you assume that heaven and hell exist in an ‘alternate’ place or reality, then do we not have the answers already?”  All of this was provoked by one of, if not the, most brilliant scientific mind of our time, or any time really.   urlLink Stephen Hawking , is a theoretical physicist who has some very interesting ideas, most, of which I am fairly sketchy on, I intend to do more looking.  Until then, check out his website, I think you will find it very interesting!    I am in possession of a St. Joseph edition, New American Bible –a Catholic Bible- and within its pages is a diagram of  urlLink   “The world of the Hebrews.”   In this diagram, it outlines the Hebrew conception of the world.  It is an interesting belief, from way back, that my Bible calls a “prescientific concept.”  God gave us the ability to think, if we neglect to use it we defile our purpose on this planet to begin with.  All theories aside, science truly doesn’t know exactly when the universe began (an estimated 15 billion years ago) and neither do theologians.  There are great many things that could be said for science, its measurements and who could leave the  urlLink “Big Bang Theory”  out in the cold. Still there are religious scholars who look back with awe on God’s creation and completely disregard the scientific possibilities.  Why can’t there be a middle ground?  Is it so hard to believe that science could measure and record the miracles that God gave us?  Perhaps for some it is too much to hope for, or believe, but it is certainly not for me.    There are those who would take the “big bang theory” and apply it very easily and neatly to the Bible.  To the surprise of many, it works.  After all, God had to begin somewhere right? There are others who say that dinosaurs never existed –even though we have entire skeletal structures to prove that they did- simply because their existence is not in the Bible.  Still there are some Bibles that speak of  urlLink Unicorns  and dragons, yet we do not have any physical proof that such beasts ever existed. Perhaps they are all mistaken; Genesis outlines the creation of the world, in seven days.  I have given this a LOT of thought, stop and think for a moment that it is very possible that seven days to God is not 24 hours on the clock.    In the realm of mans time, which God exists both inside and outside of, how could be so narrow as to believe that god had a Rolex?  Genesis 1:3-5 says “Then God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness. God called the light ‘day,’ and the darkness he called ‘night.’  Thus evening came, and morning followed –the first day.”  There are not very many that have stopped to wonder how much of this held metaphor and how much held actuality.  Consider this; because the world is round, and it spins on is axis, while circling the sun –hence day, night, and the changing of the seasons- the light constantly shines on half the world.  From God’s point of view, it was always day and always night.    The point of all of this is, if the world has existed for an estimated 15 billion years, isn’t it possible that a day to go was several thousand years, or perhaps more?  So, that being assumed true, there was plenty of time for Dinosaurs to have lived and grown extinct, perhaps God decided to create people and wanted them to be at the top of the food chain.  Dinosaurs DID exist; we have fossils and skeletons to prove it.    There are a ton of theories that lead the world into existence,  urlLink Darwin  (Who was believed to be a Christian) spoke of evolution (it is important to note that none of his ideals every contradicted or berated the bible in any way) and the popular Big Bang Theory. So, if God’s not on our watch, and things are not always to be taken literally, why do so many insist on being closed minded about both religion and Science.  That’s not really for me to say, and I have more to get to, so let’s get on with it.  I was reading about  urlLink  “near-death” experiences , and I must sat that the evidence to prove their existence is overwhelming in the favor of such an idea.  There are those who have nearly died and come back telling of the afterlife.  My question would be, if God intended us to know and understand the afterlife, wouldn’t this happen more often?  I am a firm believer that the only way to know what happens when you die is to die.  The Bible tells us that Heaven is like nothing else and that it is a place of unimaginable happiness, a paradise inherited by those who follow the lord.  I believe all of this, with all of my heart.    By the same token, I was watching a show called urlLink  “In search of…”  which air’s on the Sci-fi network.  This show tells tales of the “strange but perhaps true” and it is irresistible to me.  I sat and watched this show non-stop for nearly an entire day once.  During this day, I came across the story of a man who was a Pagan and had a near death experience, except unlike most who say they came back from paradise, he claimed he had gotten a glimpse into hell.  As unusual as it was, he is a Christian now, and never intends to return to that hell he had barely escaped from.   Like all of my other ranting and raving, this one has a point.  Perhaps, outside of what I am personally willing to believe, I can open my mind and consider that “near death experiences” could be real.  I had made the assessment that perhaps we are not meant to know the afterlife until we die.  Flip the coin, and an argument could be made that God gives us these surreal experiences to entice us, to show us his promises are real, or perhaps to let us know that we are moving along the wrong path.  Whatever the case, we cannot possibly know.  So, weather or not “near death experiences” are real, or Unicorns really exist, faith, the promise of paradise, and the need to know what we are not privy to understand drive us.  There are those who want and need for proof that God exists, that there is life after death, and that there is a meaning to life.  To them I say, simply, “Proof defies faith.”  “Proof defies faith.”  ~ Kristyn

        “It’s only when you grow up, and step back from your father or leave him for your own career or your own house –it’s only then that you can measure his greatness and fully appreciate it.  Pride reinforces love.” –Margaret Truman   Family.  Where would we be with out it?  Family is the tie that holds together civil civilization, as we know it.  Family is the one thing we are born with, seldom learn to appreciate, and grow to need more that we are willing to admit.  Now I am not going to tell you that family is only those we are born attached to for life –including the ones we wish we weren’t, take my cousins for example!  Family could be friends when you need them most, friends you grew up with.  Still, whatever your family consists of, family is the one thing we could not live with out and still function as a normal society.  Take this example to heart; look at many people in Jail, criminals, serial killers, rapists, etc. if one reads up on most of them we will realize that they had a damned bad family life, or perhaps on family at all.  Or God forbid created cults as a way to make a family.    What brought this on?  Well, I hardly ever have the opportunity to see my family. My parents, sisters, etc. mostly all live in sunny California.  However, my mom, dad, and sister Candi are coming to see me and I am so excited.  I really miss them, now I get to see them, if only briefly.  So in short, don’t take your family for granted.  When you don’t have them within arms reach you may miss them more that you would know.  ~Kristyn

        "We pay a price when we deprive children of the exposure to the values, principles and education they need to make them good citizens." ~Sandra Day O'Connor   "Boy. Girl. Person."  When I first received this assignment and read the question, I knew right away that I would be writing about my opinion on gender specific classes in schools.   I considered the complete question; will this socialize boys and girls to be more like the stereotypes we have of boys and girls? Will emphasizing differences socialize children to be better citizens?  Or, does it mean a return to emphasizing differences that have caused women to be a minority group and thus discriminated against?  Spending a great deal of time considering the question, looking at it completely from outside of my opinion, I can honestly say that I cannot reasonably see any positive aspect of such a transition.  It has always been my opinion that when one gender is singled out above another, such as in gender specific classrooms, prejudice is bred.  For example, if a boy is raised only with other boys, he is, in my opinion, more likely to believe his gender superior by example.  I feel that this is perhaps the most damaging of all negative effects of such a division, to both genders.  To boys because they learn only to trust their own gender, and to girls because they are discounted far too quickly.    Consider a world where men and women never commingled until adulthood, being completely unaware of how to interact with the opposite gender would be disastrous for a society where both men and woman play crucial roles.  Segregation breeds segregation, and in order for the next generation to exist at all, women and men must commingle.  A crucial part of co-ed classrooms is the ability for children to have peers from which to grow and form gender identity.  I believe that interacting with boys helps girls to understand themselves better, and vice versa.   It has ever been a fight for equality between men and women.  In my opinion if we are to ever reach the next step, the step where men and woman are totally equal, equality must be taught to the coming generations, to children.  If classrooms were segregated, boys in one room and girls in the other are we adults not teaching them that one gender sits above the other?  When I consider this topic, an old cliché comes to mind, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.”  By this I mean that adults are less apt to change their stripes and a life long belief in the superiority of one gender above another.    So, if I were to answer the question “will this socialize boys and girls to be more like the stereotypes we have of boys and girls?” I would have to say, absolutely!  What would we teach girls that we did not teach to boys, and vice versa?  Because the only reason I could see to segregate by gender would be to teach one gender something that is specific to their stereotype.  Would we teach girls to cook and rear children?  Would be teach boys mathematics and good economics?  Perhaps we did in the 1800, however as an enlightened society, as people who claim to be modernized; this caveman tactic would never work.    Moving on to; “Will emphasizing differences socialize children to be better citizens in a democratic society?” I would say, absolutely not!  In a truly democratic society, men and women should be chosen by their ability, education, and experience, none of which have anything to do with gender. The word “Democratic” can be defined as “Believing in or practicing social equality.”  In my opinion, the idea of social equality means equality for all, weather male or female.    Finally, the question; “Does it mean a return to emphasizing differences which have caused women to be a minority group and thus discriminated against?”  Absolutely, with out a single shred of doubt, yes!  Now, in America, women are already receiving less income for the same job.  It is a constant struggle for women to receive equal treatment due to years of “male dominated society” which I feel has got to come to an end.  Children are the leaders of tomorrow, to teach them gender equality is an invaluable asset to the future.    So in the end, I believe that segregating children by gender will breed prejudice and inequality. It will make gender identity every more difficult. It will grow a tomorrow of close-minded individuals and demoralizes the very meaning of democratic society.    ~Kristyn Hammond

        "The trouble is that not enough people have come together with the firm determination to live the things which they say they believe." ~Eleanor Roosevelt   "Socialized Health Care; one small step for socialism, one large leap for social depravity."  Imagine for a moment packed emergency rooms at 1:00am with understaffed personnel, earning half of what they once did, trying with little motivation to get patients in and out while caring very little about curing.  Closed medical tech plants that once produced state of the art treatments for Cancer and Diabetes now being used as warehouses for more profitable businesses.  Imagine more and more specialists, no longer capable of making extraordinary advances in fields of medical science, instead work as general practitioners because they have lost the financial incentive to strive for more.  This is not a third world country, or Russia after the fall of communism, this is America after it’s lost itself.  Our country flourishes in all fields because of the dedication and innovation of the individual capitalist mind that seeks only their due reward for success.    The topic has brought to light that the United States is the only highly industrialized nation without socialized health care.  I would also like to bring to light that of all existing highly industrialized nations, America is the only one that is free, the only one that strives on Capitalism, the only nation in the free work which is actually free.  By selling medical care as a “commodity” to those who can afford it, we evade the many, many problem which are associated with socialized medical care.  When medical care is socialized, the quality of treatment is no longer worth its true value, but becomes worth what the government is willing to pay for it.    In a sense, the United States already provides a form of very limited socialized medical care to those who are judged needy, we call this socially undermining invention “Medicaid.”  If we were to take a quick look at Medicaid, we would find that the health care provided by this program is worse than unacceptable, it is the lowest quality care, provided by the most uncaring under-qualified doctors who can’t get jobs anywhere else.  On another side of the very same coin we have what we have so lovingly called “free clinics” where we find the same horrid health care, by the same under-qualified doctors.  Consider for a moment why a doctor who spent 12 years or more in medical school would work for free or for what the state is willing to pay him?    If we were to socialize medicine, who would pay for the expense of research and development?  Would the government?  Yes, however they would make the money to pay for this very expensive endeavor with our tax money.  Now, since the rich pay in the highest tax bracket, and doctors make a considerable amount of money, image for a moment what would happen to the economic state of this country if we took away a major source of governmental tax income. Now, our countries doctors are not only unmotivated by the lack of their own income, but they are also paying for a good deal of the research and development it costs to treat the sick they are not even being paid very well to cure.    America is a country that is free to its very fundamental core, a country where the government has a very limited role in the day to day life of its citizens.  Immigrants from other countries still flock to America to live under our Democratic society.  America is a country that promises prosperity and freedom for all.  Socialized medicine steals the very meaning of the word prosperity and steals from those who seek our freedom their given right to be prosperous.  When other countries need medical assistance to cure some new disease, it is America with all of our prosperity to which they look.  It is America who answers their calls for help willingly.  High quality health care is dependent on and the result of research and dedication.  Putting a prince on health care provides the necessary financial motivation to continue to provide high quality health care and better the field of medicine. In a country where competition breeds quality, success, and motivation, socialized health care, like all other social programs, undermines the foundation of our country, capitalism.    ~Kristyn Hammond

      It has been so long since I wrote a posting for my blog, I think I may have forgotten how!  Nah, I really don’t think that’s possible, they say its like riding a bike, you can never for get how.  To that I say HA!  I have known plenty of people who have forgotten how to ride their bikes, fall off and get all bruised up, forget that.    So what about all of these stupid sayings, I really like them.  I have to say that I am truly a fan of cliché’s and all that goes with them and I know a thousand of em’  just try me.  Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t necessarily agree with all of them, or even most of them, but alas I still really like them.  A cliché is described by dictionary.com as “a trite or overused expression or idea.”  “What goes around comes around” for instance.  I only believe this one to a certain extent or how about “It all comes out in the wash.”  Cliché’s are everywhere!!!  My favorite were ones derived from the bible, like “do unto others…”    I really have no idea why stupid little sayings about life intreague me, they just do and it drives my hubby crazy!!!  ~Kristyn

      Just like last time, the previous two posts were journal assignments I wrote for my Sociology class and I feel that they do justice to my opinions on the matters.  ~Kristyn

        "The only way to enjoy anything in this life is to earn it first." ~Ginger Rogers   “Affirmative Action”  We can stand on our own two feet; nearly every American has the potential and should have the opportunity to achieve their highest standard.  Every single American has the right to be given an equal chance at success without the sad possibility of special treatment.  Affirmative action laws were written to protect the minorities: women, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and any persons who are considered to be a minority group in the United States.  As a woman, an American citizen, and someone who feels that she can stand on her own two feet and meet diversity head on, I oppose affirmative action.   When I moved to Texas in June of 1999 I got possibly one of the biggest surprises I had ever had.  I found that my now husband was unaware that women were not always treated equally in the workplace.  Being from Southern California and working for an employer who practiced such treatment of women, I was appalled to find that he couldn’t see it all around him.  His mother was a strong, independent woman who not only survived on her own but lived well and thrived.  With her as an example, his respect and opinion of women soared –making him perhaps a bit naïve to the societal problems women endure.  I make the observation that his mother, a woman who defeated the social norm, was a good example of how women are capable of making their goals with out special treatment or being looked down upon.  In this, his naiveté and his mother’s strength, I do make my point for all of the problems with affirmative action.  It is possible to overcome diversity, given the opportunity.  If affirmative action had been struck down as unconstitutional, more people would be forced to stand upon their own two feet and strive for their goals with more passion.  As it stands, affirmative action is a crutch for those who choose to lean upon it.  For every under-qualified person –weather they be a woman or an African American male- who is awarded with a position he did not earn and therefore does not deserve, we slap those who do deserve it in the face.    It is true that American has a long history of oppressing African American people, however we also oppressed the American Indians and Asians who choose to come here, and women as being a lesser part of “white” society.  Our past is filled with WASP leadership, yet it is not with out regret that these things were done.  Now, to grant minorities with affirmative action is to say that because they are not white and male they are not good enough to achieve higher standards by their own means and achievements.  This is simply not the truth.    Affirmative action is also a slap in the face to the so-called “majority” population.  For every college admission that is granted by race or gender, we are oppressing the other.  For example, if an individual is chosen for a college admission because of their color or gender and not their qualifications, we are oppressing the more qualified individual who was passed by for this affirmative action.  As a whole this issue is oppressive and no matter how we try to succeed at making life fair for all, someone is getting oppressed.  So now do we push for affirmative action laws for those oppressed by affirmative action?  In our society, however we may try to deny it, there exists those who are racist.  With affirmative action do we grant truth as a society to their beliefs?  These laws force everyone to look at life through colored glasses, force us to define and notice our differences in all of the most negative ways.  These laws grant to those who are racist the belief that everyone else is too.  It grants them the ability to believe that those of minority groups are automatically less qualified.  With affirmative action do we lend them truth to this claim?  Do we not breed less qualified individuals by accepting a lower standard and rejecting qualifications for the sake of gender or race?    The answer to all of these questions is yes.  There is nothing to be gained by oppression and racism.  There is nothing to be gained by affirmative action.  ~Kristyn

        "The only think necessary for the triumph of evil, it for good men to  do nothing." ~Edmund Burke   “Freedom for All”  America, the land of the free?  The Supreme Court of the United States have issued a recent ruling in the case of Lawrence & Garner vs. the State of Texas that would make even the most skeptical or radical think twice about their own opinion of freedom.  In a 6 to 3 decision, the US Supreme Court struck down so called “Sodomy Laws” in the state of Texas, making it unconstitutional for two men, or women, to be arrested for non-commercial, sexual acts in private.  If I had been asked before this ruling had come forth, I would not have believed that such a body would make such a ruling.    It is my opinion that it is not the responsibility, or business, of the law to govern social issues.  The law is to protect our liberties –liberties that they so often infringe upon.  From the platform on which I stand, gay rights are a social issue, and not one that the supposed “veil of ignorance” which shrouds the law has any right to decide upon.    The argument has been made that should gay and lesbian citizens be granted the privilege to marry, it would lead to a decline in opposite sex marriages.  This idea is ludicrous to say the very least!  Granting gay rights will not make more gay people, and currently the gay populations stay unmarried.  So, if gay men do not marry strait women, and lesbian women do not marry strait men, I ask how there could be a decline in strait marriage?  Allowing same sex marriages would change very little in the grand scheme of things.      I suppose that there are a number of “closet” homosexuals that exist in the world, yet I believe that they would still exist no matter the laws.  Homosexual people who do not admit their true sexuality generally behave this way for fear of social stigma.  In a society where a gay man can be tied to a fence and beaten to death, the social fear of persecution is a major factor in rejection and denial of sexual orientation.  Religion is another factor in such “closet” behavior, as are family, and friends.  In the end, the law plays a very small factor in the way people act socially, especially concerning very sensitive issues such as sexual orientation.  The prejudice of the law -in a government that is supposed to be indifferent- has forced the highest judicial body of the United States to decide on something that is not now, and never was their business in the first place.  The court has overcome all pressures and prejudices to prove that perhaps freedom is the most important thing after all.  America is a country that is founded on the basis of freedom for all, not freedom for some.    I have ever hoped that people –at the very core of them- had learned to overcome societal prejudice for the greater good of its citizens. People are people, weather gay or strait, black or white, old or young, and every single person in this world should have an equal opportunity to not only survive but also strive and be himself or herself.  Who you choose to love is your own business, I only find it refreshing that the supreme court believes that freedom to love, or at the very least not be persecuted and thrown in jail for that love is our fundamental right.    When all else fails, the argument could be made that enforcing “sodomy laws” is nearly completely impossible.  I ask how the law enforcement agencies could lock people away for being two consenting adults, consenting?  Law enforcement has a difficult enough time solving violent crime and can barely regulate prostitution –which is sexual deviance right in front of their faces.  Drug addicts, thieves, prostitutes, child molesters, rapists, murderers, and the like are all very serious and very real criminal issue.  How could two people who love each other and want to be left alone to their vices in the privacy of their own homes compare to so many true criminal acts?  ~Kristyn

      Football season is nearly here again!  As I gear up for another year of the greatest sport on the planet, I can’t help but look back with nostalgia at last season.  Last season, 2002 when the Tampa Bay Buc’s won the Super bowl and became the world champions!!!  My team, how I beam with pride at their victory!  I look back to the beginning of the year, back to the very first game they played and remember saying –when my husband asked me who I thought would win the Super bowl that year- “Tampa Bay, baby!! Tampa Bay’s a sure thing” to which he replied, “I don’t know, you say that every year and they haven’t come thorough for you yet!”    Now I say, “Told ya so, I told ya so!”  It was a day like no other for me as a rooted my team onto victory!  The smartest move they ever made was picking up Jon Gruden as they coach and dumping Tony Dungee.  Now don’t get me wrong, as a fan of the Buc’s I wasn’t all too pleased when they kicked Tony to the curb, but I can’t ignore the fact that they won the world championship the very first season that Gruden was with them.  It definitely helps that Jon Gruden has always been my favorite football coach, even though he was the coach of a team I hate, the Oakland Raiders.  Okay, so now that my favorite team won the highest prize in football, the Lombardi trophy.  I look at them now, trying to decide if I would choose them for another year of football victory and I have to say they definitely make the cut, except for one minor indiscretion, Chris Simms!  Chris Simms is a stuffed up prick riding on his father’s coattail.  He’s no where near as good as he should be, can’t hold a candle to Major Applewhite, and his father was never anything worth looking at twice either.  For a man who thinks so damned much of himself, Chris Simms is second rate, just like his old man!  All rants aside, they still harbor my favorite Defensive Tackle in the League, Warren Sapp.  Yet I wonder if that’s enough now.  With the loss of Warrick Dunn, big mistake, I think I am going to aim my good luck cheers in another direction this season, yet where, I am not quite sure.    I have wondered if the Dallas Cowboys have what it takes to perk my interest this year, now that they dumped most of their dead weight –Dave Campos. They picked up some fresh blood Bill Parcels –who is most likely appreciated in Dallas but not in New York, as we saw when Jeremy Shockey called him a “homo.”    I so love the shit talkers of football! So I doubt that I will be watching much of the Cowboys this year, while I live in Texas, I can’t help looking and seeing them as a disappointment!  I think that I may root for the Colts this year, I do so enjoy watching Payton Manning.  Still, I am not sure they perk my interest… so as it stands, I am yet with out a team to root for, yet with out a team that excites me, yet with out a team to be my heart and soul for the 2003 year!  Still, when I finally come to the end of my long search –which I hope will be soon- I shall let you know who I have chosen to be “my team” this year.  ~Kristyn

       When asked to name the chief qualification a politician should have. "It's the ability to foretell what will happen tomorrow, next month, and next year --- and to explain afterward why it didn't happen." ~Sir Winston Churchill    I have no choice but to share my thoughts on the California Governor problems.  I am from California, born and raised, and I moved to Texas in June of 1999.  I am glad I did.  I would seem that in California, Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for governor, along with him, Larry Flint –Hustler Porn King- is also running.  I would hate to be a resident of California right now!  How could someone like Larry Flint even be considered for governor in California?  Who would vote for him?  I certainly would not.  I don’t believe I would vote for Arnold either.  Yet I wonder what real chance there is to choose, Larry Flint would definitely be a far worse choice than Arnold would, but by how much?    Take for instance Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is running on the Republican ticket, yet he is married to a Kennedy –who are known for being flaming liberals!  So by this evidence, it doesn’t matter what ticket he runs on, he’s in bed with the Kennedy’s!  He goes on TV and says he will not take campaign contributions and turns around in the same sentence and says that his promoters are planning fund-raisers for him.  Someone should tell the man that fund-raisers are accepting campaign contributions.  He is an actor, he oversteps his boundary.    LARRY FLINT!  Who in the hell would vote for Larry Flint?  What would his campaign promise be “Two whores for every house!”?  What skill does the man have that would qualify him for such a position, other than a big mouth and a perverted mind?    To say there very least, Californians are in a touch spot right now, thank god I am not one of them!  ~Kristyn

      The day grows closer, September 7th, the first day of football season!  I am still without a team to call my own, though I am leaning heavily toward the Colts.  I have found something new and exciting to fulfill my ever-growing appetite for FOOTBALL, Fantasy Football.  Okay, so perhaps Fantasy Football is not new, but it’s new to me.    Though I have to admit when I was asked to join a league I was first excited, then a bit leery, then excited, then leery.  In the end, I ended up joining; who can say what will happen from here.  All I can say is that Brett Farve had better have one more good year in him, the Raven’s defense had better not disappoint me, and Amos Zaroque had better pay off in his bold move to start in front of Jarome Bettis!  So root me on, I may need the help!  ~Kristyn

        “When you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate more on the preservation of the future.” ~Dian Fossey   In a world of easy come…easy go, it has occurred to me that we lead lives that are somewhat flawed.  Everyone works and works, generally undesirable and drab jobs, to get by in the world, yet when do we take time to stop and smell the roses?  If all we do is work, when do we enjoy the fruits of our labors?  If all we do is spend sun-up to sundown droning around mindlessly hating our lives, when do we take a moment to enjoy the better things in life?  All of these questions have occurred to me recently.  Perhaps its because my life has suddenly become terribly busy!  I just started school for the Fall Semester at  urlLink MCC  and I have been going endlessly for almost 2 weeks now, yet I have had very, very little time to enjoy the things I love in life.  I haven’t had time to pick up and book or work on my PbeM postings in weeks.  I go to class, work 15 hours a week at work-study, and study. Matt goes to class, works and studies. We run our errands, grocery shopping, cleaning our house, cleaning my in-laws house, sleeping less than 6 hours a night, and though it all when do we have time to enjoy our lives?  We only live once, I only regret that our lives are full of the hustle-bustle of “getting by.”  The average human life span is about 75 years give or take 10 years depending on your health, sex, etc. and we spend 55 – 65 years of that 75 years working.  We spend the best, most active years of our lives slaving away for someone else’s benefit.  All in all, I am less than enthusiastic about the prospect of life in the fast lane.    How can I neglect things I love, how can I deny myself enjoyment, how can I put my husband aside for a lack of time, how can I justify not calling my mom enough?  All for a crapy $6.50 an hour work-study job?  Life has grown gray.  When I move so quickly and neglect things I love everything seems to grow dark.    I suppose the largest examples are the fact that my PbeM group –to which I am one of the group leaders- has begun to fall by the wayside.  This activity involves writing for a “group-oriented story” once every two days or so, yet I can’t seem to make enough time for it and its something that I have committed myself to doing.  So life and all of its creepers have grown over my ability to actually live.    It begs the question: What the hell is the point of life if we never actually live?  ~Kristyn

       "It's just a game!"   I think I should start this blog by just saying that I am a gamer, I am proud to be a gamer, and gaming is not something I would ever give up.  Okay, now that that is said, I must say that it has come to my attention that there are those who would judge us by our pass times of all things.  There are so many other things we could be judged for; our pass-times should be our own!  It has come to my attention that some people would go so far as to blame gaming and games such as Dungeons & Dragons for all sorts of terrible deeds.  If a gamer kills themselves, it’s automatically the work of the devil through the use of D&D, what a crock of shit!  Excuse my French – pardon the expression.  Dungeons and Dragons is a game, books, paper, and dice, not some gate to the underworld.    Now I must say that we have all heard of those who get a bit carried away in the game and jump from rooftops thinking that they can fly, and terrible things like that.  When we hear of these nut cases we cringe as a whole, all gamers cringe as one.  Every single time one of these stories get out to the public, it makes all of us gamers look crazy!  The truth of the matter is that we are pretty sane, all in all.  Crazy people can golf, that doesn’t make the golf green the devil’s den!  Of course not!  So I have referenced a few website’s that are good to read on this topic:   urlLink Paul Cardwell, Jr. Chair of the Committee for the Advancement of Role-Playing Games (CAR-PGa), an international network researching all aspects of role-playing games.      urlLink A parent’s guide to Role Playing Games.

       “These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.” ~Thomas Paine (1737-1809) American political theorist, writer    Expectation.  What can be expected of one man?  Is it fair for the world to look at a man, one single, solitary man to carry the weight of the world with out err?  Is it fair for sports fans to look to one player to carry his team?  Could it truly be the power of one?  Is there such a thing as the “power of one?”  When do expectations become overwhelming brutality?    Several days ago I was sitting, waiting for my Introduction to Law class to start when a discussion arose about the patriotism of Johnny Depp.  It would appear that Johnny Depp moved to France when George W. Bush was elected president of the United States.  He likened the United States to a puppy with big teeth and a bad bark.  From this conversation came the topic of war in the middle east, war against Iraq.  A woman in my class made the ignorant comment that there were no weapons of mass destruction, claiming that it was more like “Weapons of Mass Delusion.”  I have been thinking about it ever since.    It was brought to light by a rather wise 18 year old that not only did we find the weapons of mass destruction, but their tyrannical ruler was using the weapons against his own people, so they obviously exist!  A point that I found very hard to dispute –not that I was trying to dispute them, I was on his side.  To which she commented that our president could have handled the situation more delicately, through the United Nations.  HA!  The UN did nothing but procrastinate.  The young man said he believed we should withdraw from the UN –a bit drastic if you ask me!  Still, it begs the question: How much can be expected of one man?  How much can we blame on George W. Bush who is only doing what he can to keep our nation safe?  When foreign terrorism landed on our shores, for the first time ever really –as opposed to domestic terrorism- our nation was shocked by the terror and death that surrounded us all and affected each and every American.  If it didn’t touch us personally, we felt for those that were devastated by the pain, we felt violated.  How could this happen in America?  Yet it did.    How could any one person who lived through the utter horror of 9/11 be anything but supportive of the war on terrorism?  How could any American who calls him or herself patriots not raise the flag and support our troops and president in his actions?  Those who do not should be ashamed of themselves!  Every other day we hear about a “superstar” publicly opposing President Bush, fools!  It gives me great heart to see how those so-called “superstars” are treated in the face of such un-called for comments.  Sean Penn, Dustin Hoffman, Dixie Chicks, Johnny Depp –pampered, sorry excuses for Americans!  Yet there are those who would boycott these stars, myself among them, good Americans, good people!  So if you ask me, I believe that if you choose to look at one man to carry the world, you should realize that his decision are not to please you but rather to keep you safe –against your will if need be.  If one man is to carry the world on his shoulders, if one man is to be our modern day Atlas, let him carry the world to protection weather we want it or not.  Yet it has not happened yet, George W. Bush is not entirely responsible, we have this waste of time and space we call Congress who would fight him today and praise him tomorrow, let them share the responsibility.  Let them take some of the flak for our situations that they helped create, rather than running for cover when trouble or the more and more unpatriotic rear their ugly heads!  ~ Kristyn

       "Proud member of the vast right-wing conspiracy" ~Unknown    Forgive my morals, for they have led me to this place and time, unto this topic.  I have to say that I am sorry and if I insult anyone, tough! I know what I believe and if you disagree you can email me, however let me say you will not be able to change my mind.    I was watching a special on Tech TV pertaining to the rather large problem of people pirateing music off of the internet.  I have to wonder why people do this.  People just do not seem to understand that it is STEALING!  If you download a song for free off of the internet, rather than that forign concept called BUYING it, the people who put their time and effort in creating that make nothing, nada, not one red cent!!!  I know people who wouldn't walk into their local convienience store and steel a candy bar, but they persist in downloading tons of pirated music, movies, and games from the interenet...why?    Now, God bless the music industry, those who have downloaded thousands of stolen songs are getting sued!  GO MUSIC INDUSTRY!!! The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is persisting in suing those who are guilty of steeling.  From what I understand there will be no jail time, but monetary compesation will be sought.    Whatever your opinion is, whatever you believe about his anomaly, there will be no mistaking what I believe.  Why is it that people are comfortable committing crimes when they can commit them from the comfort of their own homes?  Why are people willing to steel if they think they're safe from persecution?  Does the population of the pirates not realize that their IP addy can be tracked, the government CAN find you, you are NOT safe from persecution,  you CAN be found and sued!!!  Get it though your thick, criminal heads, this is not okay!  ~Kristyn

       "The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights, cannot claim to be defenders of minorities." ~Ayn Rand    While watching  urlLink MSNBC  yesterday morning I was shocked to hear that a woman, Amina Lawal, had been sentenced to be stoned to death in Nigeria in March of 2002, following the birth of her daughter two years after divorcing her husband.  Apparently, Lawal has sex out of wedlock and was convicted of this act as a crime by Islamic courts.  What struck me strange was that this woman pled guilty to this “crime.”  Lawal said that the man she engaged in sexually agreed to marry her, he was brought up on charges, denied it, and was acquitted for lack of proof.  I suppose that if they are so barbaric that they stone human beings to death they wouldn’t have this little thing called DNA testing.    If the sentence had been carried out, the 32-year-old would have been the first woman stoned to death since 12 northern states first began adopting strict Islamic law, or Shariah, in 1999.   On reading further into the matter, I found that several men in this country have said that they would “gladly” carry out the stoning themselves believing the overturning of her sentencing to be a violation of the Quran. Many in Katsina, Nigeria have renounced the sentence, believing it lawful to stone this woman to death.  Apparently they believe that such acts discourage “crime.” Several other women and a pair of lovers have also been sentenced to death; all but the pair of lovers have been acquitted.    So I have to wonder how the word “crime” is defined in other countries?  In America, a “Crime” is defined as a wrong doing against society as a whole.  A wrong doing in which punishment can be sought as compensation for the wrongdoing. In America a crime is punishable by fine, imprisonment, and occasionally, under extreme circumstances, death.  Now I have to make a side note in saying that I am for the death sentence in America.  I believe that it is just punishment for horrible crimes, yet this is a top all of its own for another time.    Stoning a woman to death for being human is unreasonable and irresponsible in my opinion.  Stoning any person to death for such a “crime” is irrational.  I can admit that there are those religions where such acts are not only accepted by also encouraged.  Still, Nigeria has ratified international treaties banning torture.  Lawal’s defense used this treaty as leverage, I would have to say that I agree that stoning a person to death is torture.    However, in reading over all this terrible injustice, I have found a ray of hope.  An Islamic court has overturned her conviction.  While I believe that the grounds for dismissal should have been outrage and disgust at the way a human being was going to be brutally killed, they overturned it saying that she didn’t have enough chance to defend herself.  Either way, it was overturned.  I only wonder how this woman will get by in a society that feels that she has escaped the justice of religion?  ~Kristyn

      The Dixie Chicks are in the news again.  I am listening to talk radio right now and Gary McNamara is talking about the Dixie Chicks.  Aparently the all too inappropriate country trio have decided that they are going to be rockers now and want nothing to do with Country music now.  Why?  I can't say.    Earlier in the year, at a March 10th Concert in London, their lead singer Natalie Maines said; "Just so you know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas."   The comment raised quite a ruckus, fans were dropping them like a bad hairdo, people were trying to get refunds for their concert tickets, it seemed at the time that their little loud mouth stunt had cost them dearly.  They refused to refund the tickets already purchased for their sold out concerts and they were regreting the decision to make such an unfounded remark in public.    Now, it seems that their indescression has blown over.  They're selling out their concerts again and have fans again the U.S. I myself used to be a fan of the Dixie Chic's, yet in light of their disrespectful comment about the President of the United States, I find myself disgusted with their complete lack of respect for the souls of those who lost their lives on 9/11.  Their comment was disrespectful to the families of the dead, the people who died in this terrible and to the Troops who were traveling to the Middle East to defend the right of our country to live free.    Nowm  dixie chicks are "getting out of Country music" and I can't help but smile.  In my mind and from my point of view, they have lost their fan base and now have to move on.  The country music community has risen up and said "shame on you!" The fans of the world listened, and now they have no choice but to get away from all of the bad publicity.  Now it's true that Natalie Maines has come out with a  urlLink public apology  yet that does very little to change the fact that it was said.  It shows how little patriotism they actually have, which is a major factor in Country Music, and to its fans!  Shame on them!!!  ~ Kristyn

       "Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing." ~Vince Lombardi     Okay so I am absolutely pissed!  Is there no sportsman ship in the world anymore? Now don’t get me completely wrong, I know that there is.  I love football, it’s by far my favorite sport, but I saw something today that just infuriated me!  I was watching the Houston Texans v. Jacksonville Jaguars game on CBS this afternoon, which was a great game, and I saw the most UNSPORTSMAN-like thing I have ever seen.  As long as I have been watching and LOVING football I have seen some pretty low blows but this took the cake.  So here’s what happened…  J.J. Moses went back for the punt (or Kick?) return –which he had been very successful doing the entire game- anyway, he started to call fair catch when out of nowhere came #17 Jimmy Redmond and hit the poor guy, knocking him to the ground.  A penalty was called on the guy, but what he did was just sooooo messed up that I am still pissed and that game has been over for 15 minutes.  Basically it came down to the fact that the sorry jackass was taking revenge for J.J.’s incredible success in running on his team!  All I have to say is that perhaps he should take a good long look at himself and his team and their inability to stop the run!  So to make a long story short, I now HATE the Jacksonville Jaguars, believing them to be terrible sportsmen, and really sorry losers!  ~Kristyn

       "The naked truth is always better than the best-dressed lie." ~Ann Landers    Dictionary.com defines Pretentious as “Claiming or demanding a position of distinction or merit, especially when unjustified.”  Yesterday, Matt and I were talking about the ethics of being a Prostitute.  It all came up when we were talking about the fact that I keep having repeated dreams about Amsterdam and CooCoo-Clocks.  Anyway, he asked me if I believed Prostitution is unethical.  I told him that I didn’t think it was necessarily unethical, that it was a business like any other.  If a woman chooses to sell her body like a T-bone that’s her prerogative.  That being said, I DO have Religious issues with it…a topic for another day.  It got me to considering all of the things in this world that may claim the title “Pretentious.”  Escort services and Vegas Nude shows top my list.  I have to say that I have far more respect for Prostitutes and Strippers than I do for Escorts and Vegas Dancers.  Of all the things in the world, being a Stripper cuts out the glorified mask.  If a woman says, “I’m a stripper” you really don’t have to wonder what she does, she’s not trying to pretend she’s something that she’s not.  On the other hand, if a woman tells you she’s a “Dancer in a Las Vegas Nude show” then she’s trying to hide the fact that she takes her clothes off for money behind fancy costumes, sequins and boas.  It’s ridiculous!  Likewise, if you find out that a woman is a hooker, you know what she does for a living and she’s not trying to hide it.  If she says she an “escort” you know she’s really a prostitute in disguise!    Now I realize that it is socially acceptable and politically correct to be Pretentious, but what the HELL!  Several other things that top my list of annoyingly pretentious are: Lap dogs that parade as cats, local bands who think they’ve made it big because they made a CD on their Karioke machine, fad lesbians, and Democrats!  ~Kristyn

       "With talent on loan from God." ~ Rush Limbaugh    To tell the truth…  On Saturday night I was in the grocery store picking up some Coffee.  When I went to the checkout there was an Enquirer with Rush Limbaugh’s face on the cover and a heading that read something like this. “Rush caught in Drug Scandal!”  My husband and I simply laughed it of, thinking that the enquirer paparazzi had struck again.  Today, while checking my e-mail, I happened by the MSN home page.  On this page was a heading about Rush Limbaugh being addicted to drugs.  The cover of Newsweek magazine with Rush’s face on the cover.  He apparently broke-down and admitted to millions of listeners on Friday that he was addicted to prescription drugs.  It was stunned.  My husband Matt and I listen to Rush’s show, I would call us fans.  I couldn’t believe that a man who’s advice and strait-forward tell em’ like it is radio was popping pills.    You can read more about the story here…  urlLink  “Rush’s world of Pain” at Newsweek on MSN    All I really have to say, or shall I say my only opinion on this matter is that I commend the man for being big enough to come out with it.  Granted he had already been outed, but it says a great deal for the character of the man when he had the courage to tell the truth.  Truth is a seemingly foreign concept to America these days. Ever since Bill Clinton lied on the stand and to a grand jury about his involvement with Monica Lewinski, lying seems to be a HUGE fad! Liberal mouth Al Franken was quick to condemn Rush about his problems.  Can you believe it, a LIBERAL calling Rush a hipocrit!  What a jerk…what a total Jerk!  So to make a long story short, if I could say one thing to Rush, I think I would say; “You go Rush.  At least you had the courage to come out and say you have a problem.”  ~Kristyn

       "Accountablility in friendship is the equivalent of love without strategy." ~Anita Brookner    Recently I have been thinking a great deal about friendship –once again!  I have been wondering if simply knowing someone constitutes a friendship, or is there a deeper level of involvement in a “friendship”?  I know a good deal of people, yet I have been wondering how many of those I would call friend.  If just knowing someone constitutes a friendship than what is there to keep that friendship alive other than to continue knowing someone?  If there is a deeper level of involvement, what does that involve?  While I realize that every person’s definition of a friendship is different, the matter can be addressed none the less. Dictionary.com defines a friend as: “A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.”  Likewise, Friendship is defined as: “The quality or condition of being friends.”  Now that I have gotten that out of the way, it’s on with the topic.  If all that is required for a friendship is to simply know someone-which is a contradiction to the definition given above- then what is an acquaintance?  I know several people who believe that a friendship is a simple state of knowing someone.  I personally believe that a friendship is a relationship like any other and needs to be nurtured and cared for and given attention to, to exist.   Take for example a friend of mine.  I have this friend who would call himself or herself friend of mine, yet does not wish to do anything to nurture that friendship any further than the simple act of knowing me.  While I find this unacceptable, what can be done?  I have tried to give this friendship attention and yet it fails to rouse the other party.  A friendship, like any other relationship, takes two –or more.    I suppose this topic has come from my frustration with the state of many of my friendships of late.  I wonder sometimes if I really have many friends, and weather or not I should care.  I do care yet I don’t have the first clue in figuring out what to do about that!  The entirety of the situations just irks me to no end, and puzzles me at the same time.    My husband has a friend who has been his friend since he was a child.  Yet this friend doesn’t come by, and Matt doesn’t go to visit him most of the time.  They talk on the phone very rarely, yet call themselves “best friends!”  It is so frustrating to me.  How can this be a “best friendship”?  I consider a “best friend” to be something greater than a friendship, something far more lasting and complete.  Something without bounds and ultimately understanding.    It just seems to me that once a friend is made, that friendship is tried and stretched and lost over time.  The single exception to that is Mindy, whom moved to Seattle when we were in the tenth grade and we are still friends to this very day.  Yet all others fail to meet the standards of friendship before long and I loose what could have been a good friend, or what had been a good friend.  It’s all so aggravating to me!  As I look back on many friendships I have shared over the span of my life, I just feel that I am lacking when it comes to understanding most of them.  When I lived in California, I had a lot of what I thought were friends –they all turned out not to be when put to the test- yet I believed they were friends and when they all turned their backs on me and called me names, it hurt to no end.  I wonder how someone can be so two faced?  Or a group of someone’s for that matter!  So now, I look behind me as often as forward in looking at the overall worth of a friendship.  Still, in all of the trouble I have had in the past, I continue to look for friends wherever they may be found.  Most of which fail for one reason or another.    So yes, I do believe that it takes more than the simple act of knowing someone to make them your friend…   ~ Kristyn

       “The events in our lives happen in a sequence in time, but in their significance to ourselves, they find their own order…the continuous thread of revelation.”  ~ Eudora Welty   It is often of late that I feel things that I don’t understand, feelings toward certain people or situation.  Perhaps anger toward something which should be neutral to me, or neutrality toward something that should outrage me.  When I take a step back and examine these feelings that catch me off guard, I often find that my morality &/or ethics has been compromised or offended in some way that I would have never seen or believed.    Take for instance a situation with a couple that is friends with my husband and I.  I can honestly say that I am not fond of the male half of the relationship.  He’s overbearing and treats his wife like a subservient piece of meat with absolutely no regard for her feelings or even the fact that she is a person.  My morals are offended already, just talking about it!  He would rather sleep and play video games than spend time with her and if she gets fed up with it and picks up a book he accuses her of not spending time with him.  Selfish doesn’t even begin to cover it!  She cooks for him and he won’t eat it, then wakes her up in the middle of the night to make him a sandwich, a damned sandwich!  He’s cold and irrational and believes a wife is a sex toy!  I have never really been fond of him, even before they got married, I had always thought he was a bit… oh I don’t know what the word is, he was just so damned nerve grindingly annoying!  Take her, she and I get along really well, mostly.  She’s a bit too willing to put up with his shit.  A little too willing to let him treat her like she's a sex slave.  It’s nearly aggravating to no end!  The whole situation just makes me want to scream!    Okay, now onto how this example would betray my sense of ethics and morality.  I feel like they could not possibly love one another.  To love is to see in another soul what you are in the depths of your own.  To love is to connect with a kindred spirit, another person who can see you.  A true love is a person who can walk through the walls around your heart as if they were never there at all.  To love is the most profound sense of self, in the deepest sense of your own life.  To be in love is to have a person who you are not complete without.  A true lover is a person who would leave an irreplaceable emptiness within your soul if they were ever lost to you.    So if they are not in love then why does she put up with him?  Why would he stay?  If they are in love then I wonder why I like her at all.  Under the above definition of love, because I dislike him so, how could I truly like her at all?  I see her not doing anything for herself in the situation and it offends a deep part of my soul in a way that I could never explain in words.  It makes me angry that I would waste my time with someone who refuses to do something so profoundly basic for him or herself.  I only want my friends to be happy, truly happy, not some weak shadow of pleasure with life.   I really don’t believe it’s too much to ask.  I suppose that I grow more and more aware of my own sense of morality by the day.  I never doubt from where my morals are formed and how they have been influenced over time.  I believe in God and know that he will guide my in making my moral decisions.    Still, I sigh at some situations around me and wish and pray that I could do something to change them, to make them better, or at least help them in some way.  Yet the world is an expecting one, fully of political correctness and lies.  That by itself offends my morality and ethics.  Niceties offend my ethics, political correctness and everything that it implies offends me to no end.  My husband said to me the other day, “Aren’t you tired of always being nice?  Doesn’t it feel fake?”  To which I answered an unequivocal “Yes!”  Still, being a Christian teaches us to be tolerant with the world and those around us.  I can be tolerant, only so long as my own morals and ethics are not severely compromised.  ~Kristyn

       "Maybe being oneself is always an acquired taste." ~Patricia Hempl    I ask myself constantly why it’s so damned hard to figure out what I want to do with my life.  I mean, I know what I would really like to do, but how do I know that once I get started I won’t find it a bore just like everything else I’ve tried?  That’s why I’m 25 years old and still trying to graduate from Jr. College.  I feel like such a failure sometimes!  It’s stupid, I realize that I have years to live –unless a bus hits me tomorrow or something- but most 25 year olds are out of school by now.  There are students in my classes who are 18 & 19 years old.  What I wouldn’t give to be 18 years old again.    That brings me to my point, what would you give to be 18 years old again?  What would you give to take back all the mistakes you’ve made?  Sometimes I think it would be a dream come true, most of the time I just think that unless I know them what I know now, I would make the same damned mistakes all over again.  No, I know I would.  It’s a no win situation!  Okay, I’m both rambling and bitching, so, I guess I’ll stop.  But think it over…would you make the same mistakes if you could do it all again?  ~Kristyn

       “A woman has got to love a bad man one or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one.”  ~ Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings   Have you ever wondered what would happen to a relationship that has gone south when both parties to the relationship try clinging to its dying remnants for their drab, in the gutter coupling?  I think I have recently found out.  It’s the single saddest thing I have ever seen, it’s the single saddest thing anyone has ever seen (speaking relatively, of course).    One party wants a divorce, the other says no, they try to patch things up, have what is probably a pretty ordinary, boring, make-up fuck, and they think that life is all good!  How can anyone be so damned naïve?  So what happens next week when party #1 wants a divorce again?  Or the week after that when boring make-up sex has reached its height and just turns into normal relationship sex again?  Then what?  All I have to say is if my marriage turns that cliché and utterly sad, I hope someone will put me out of my misery!   I mean come on, I am not trying to be mean, really, one party to the couple is a really good friend of mine, I just think she’s being especially meek about this whole situation.  I just want to kick her and say, “Dump the ass-hole, you can do better!” but when I open my mouth to speak, all that comes out is, “I hope y’all can work this out, I know you love one another…” blah, blah, blah!  It’s gotten to the point that I am nearly completely personally insulted by her naiveté.  She and I are pretty close friends, I feel for her in this situation, yet the realization that there is not one damned thing I can do for her is killing me!  I want to kick her husband in the nuts and tell him to grow up and be a man, he’s too old to be acting like this!    Yet when the day is done, I don’t, they don’t, life is still as sorry and angry as it was when the day began…Truly its not that I don’t understand their situation.  I was a party to an especially bad relationship once, it lasted 5 long and miserable years and when it was done I cried more for becoming a statistic than for the ending of misery.  When I got divorced from my first hubby, I was happier than I was when I married him.  I never shed one tear for him or his feelings; I shed hundreds because I had just made myself into a societal statistic, “65% of marriages end in divorce!”  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!  Don’t get me wrong, I am a Christian and I know that being a good wife is important, I consider myself a very good wife right now.  I know that to divorce is going against religion in many ways, yet it couldn’t be helped…I guess that I shouldn’t have made the stupid mistake of marrying the jerk to begin with.  I did, but I fixed that mistake and now he’s some other poor sap's…that is, some other poor woman’s problem.  Poor girl, if I hadn’t hear that she was such a bitch and that they make a perfect pair, I might have even felt sorry for her.  So, all in all I think that the quote at the beginning is right!  You have to experience BAD love to know GOOD love when you see it.  I know good love now, I just wished with all my heart that my friend could.  Perhaps some day she will come to her senses, I pray for that day!  ~Kristyn

       "A religious awakening which does not awaken the sleeper to love has roused him in vain." ~ Jessamyn West    While perusing the Internet this afternoon, my husband –who was also on the Internet- called my attention to the website of the  urlLink  Eternal Grace Congregation Church .  It would appear that a man by the name of Father Ramos has proceeded, completely uninformed, to baselessly attack Gamers, those of us who play role-playing games.  After reading this religious attack on a helpless little pass-time and those of us who choose to partake in it, I found myself appalled by his moral reasoning, or lack there of.  I am going to start by pointing out the problems with his rationale.  1.) In the first paragraph he condones lying and misleading an entire group of people.   2.) Of thousands of people just in the United States alone, he had sited only 3 incidents where role-players died violently and blamed it on role-playing –with absolutely NO proof of that role-playing lead to their deaths. 3.) In the first paragraph he has proceeded to put down Methodists!  Not my choice of church, but one that is recognized as a Christian institution of God.  4.) Also, in the first paragraph “Father Ramos” condoned fabricating stories and lying to someone, not a very Christian thing to do if you ask me! 5.) He repeatedly calls Catholics a cult; placing them in the same category as Pagans. 6.) He refers to role-playing as the “Devil’s tool.” 7.) He repeatedly refers to role-players as homosexual, drug addicted, Catholic, deviants.  (What an idiot!) 8.) He believes that role-players are a bunch of crazed idiots who can not discern reality from fantasy. 9.) The article refers to groups of role-players as cults. 10.) He also refers to Gay-basing as a method of bringing homosexuals to god.   After reading all of this I couldn’t help but shake my head in utter disbelief of the supposed moral high ground some choose to take.  In light of this disturbing sentiment that role-players are homosexual deviant Catholics on the loose in society, I feel disappointed in anyone who would choose to believe this.  Role-players are simply groups of people who choose to play a specific type of game.  If a group of people got together every week to play monopoly would they automatically be called homosexual deviants? I think not, board games are considered a “wholesome” pass-time.    What about the groups of people who are so addicted to soap operas that they believe the characters are real.  These people who go up to soap stars in the streets and shame them for actions taken by their on screen persona’s.  What about actors, who undertake a series of different persona’s for a living.  I don’t hear anyone screaming that Acting is from the Devil and all actors should find more “wholesome” jobs.  I don’t hear crackpot preachers screaming out at the Oscars that all actors are homosexual Catholic deviants and are going to hell.    Or what about people who shoot singers and actors out of some twisted fantasy that they are in love with them and if they can’t have them then no one can, which is what happened to Selena.  All in all I would have to say that role-players are just something that is out there to pick on.  Something for crackpot’s who hide behind the so-called “word of God” with no reference in to the bible or to scripture, and call themselves preachers, to lean on.  So I say, get a life and learn more about your subject before you go out arbitrarily writing something you have no idea about.  If anything is a cult around here it’s you and anyone who chooses to follow your moral degradation, “Father Ramos”.  ~ Kristyn

       “Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.” ~ Francisco d’Anconia (Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand)   So lately I have been thinking a lot about relationships, not mine really, but those of the people around me.  I suppose that it’s a relatively common thing to think of considering that nearly all of my friends have some trouble or other.  The question on my mind is how much is too much?  When does a loving request or a deep dark fantasy become depravity?  When does it cross the line, breaking the determined boundary?  I suppose that for these questions to be answered I would have to explain what is meant by “determined boundary.”  It is my belief that, in a relationship of any kind, the two parties set the boundaries of the relationship in the very beginning, either by conscious spoken agreements, or by actions.  The boundaries exist for the understanding and benefit of both parties; they are set to the liking of both parties and can be changed only by the express consent of both parties involved.  For example, if at the beginning of a relationship a couple expresses to one and other that they wish for the relationship to be an “open” relationship, they both agree, then go on this way for 2 years.  One day, one party wishes to change that to monogamy, it should be by the consent of both partners.  Another less exaggerated example would be if from the beginning of a relationship the couple never talks about past relationships, then it should change only by the consent of both partners.    Okay, now. When is it hypocrisy?   When does it become too much?  What is a fair thing to expect of your partner?    I have been thinking that it is mostly consistent of what the parties to the relationship are willing to put up with.  In a relationship, each partner brings something, or things, of value to the relationship –if they didn’t there wouldn’t be a relationship. If one party brings more than the other, that partner has a right to request equal trade.  Yet in the system of Objectivism, where two parties should be allotted equal trade for his or her value, value should be an “objective” term.  The said “value” SHOULD NOT be determined by the value that the parties place upon their commodity.  It is pretty much understood that people have trouble being objective about their own value, ego and pride play devils advocate when measuring ones own value.    So if this is true, and two parties cannot come to an agreement, what should be the remedy?  I personally believe that there can be none.  I think that either a partner is willing to see the objective value in his or her partner, or they are not.    It’s not for a person to waste their value, or witle it down to the “Expected” value of their partner.  So I sigh, because it’s a question which plagues me and one which I cannot solve.  I’ll keep you posted…  Kristyn

       Merry Christmas & Happy New Year, Y’all!    I just love this holiday season!  Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t love every holiday, but this one definitely has my vote for best overall holiday –I mean what other holidays yields you a tree full of presents?  Of course there are other reasons why this is a great holiday, reasons that most people forget completely.  Christmas is the celebration of the savior of the human race, I’d say that makes it a pretty important time of year.  So, while your opening one of those gifts wrapped under your tree, stop and take a moment to say thanks to the guy who really deserves it…  Merry Christmas, again…  I also wanted to share this story with you.  "The Candymaker’s Witness"  A Candymaker in Indiana wanted to make a candy that would be a witness, so he made the Christmas Candy Cane.  He incorporated several symbols of the birth, ministry and death of Jesus Christ.  He began with a stick of pure white, hard candy.  White to symbolize the Virgin Birth, and the sinless nature of Jesus, and hard to symbolize the Solid Rock, the foundation of the Church, and firmness of the promises of God.  The Candymaker made the candy in the form of a “J” to represent the precious name of Jesus, who came to earth as our Savior.  It could also represent the staff of the “Good Shepherd” with which He reaches down into the ditches of the world to lift out the fallen lambs who, like all sheep, have gone astray.  Thinking that the candy was somewhat plain, the Candymaker stained it with red stripes.  He used three small stripes to show the stripes of the scourging Jesus received by which we are healed.  The large red stripe was for the blood shed by Christ on the cross so that we could have the promise of eternal life.   Unfortunately, the candy became known as a Candy Cane, a meaningless decoration seen at Christmas time.  But the meaning is still there for those who “have eyes to see and ears to hear”.  I pray that this symbol will again be used to witness To The Wonder of Jesus and His Great Love that came down at Christmas and remains the ultimate and dominant force in the universe today.

       "If we could all sell our experiences for what they cost us, we'd all be millionaires." ~ Abigail Van Buren    What a disaster!  While I enjoyed the holidays with my hubby, Matt, Christmas still turned out to be a pain –Literally!  Now don’t get me wrong, we did all of the Christmas “stuff,” gave each other gifts, had a really nice time together –unfortunately this was only after the car accident which totaled our Crown Victoria LX!  AAAHHHHH!!!    While driving home from dropping a friend we had a really, pretty bad car accident, on Christmas Eve!  It sucked, really sucked, and we spent Christmas in some serious pain.  Matt couldn’t move his head from left to right, and his shoulder couldn’t move. My neck hurt, pretty bad!  GGGRRRRR!  We’re feeling better now, thank GOD!  So we had a pretty good New Years.  A friend from Austin came down and spent the week after Christmas with us, which was really, really nice.  He’s a nice guy; we all had a good time hanging out.    On a much better note, school is starting on January 12th and Matt and I are SOOOOO very ready.  We’re both really looking forward to this semester and come May we’re both transferring to a University here in Texas, wish us luck!  I’m going to be an English Major with a duel in Fine Arts.  Matt is going for Physics and Mathematics.    Otherwise, life is good!  I hope y’all had a good Christmas holiday and a Happy New Year!  I must say that so far 2004 is looking up, it should be a better year than 03’ was…hopefully.    ~ Kristyn

      Being that its Martin Luther King Day, I suppose I got to thinking about civil liberties and civil liberty inequality.  Everyone knows who Dr. King was and what he did for the African American Civil Liberties Movement.  Its only right that there should be a day for the man, he did a good deal to help us realize that the color of your skin does not make you who you are and that people are people, inside.    Still, in light of this, racism still flares around the world.  Yet it’s not just of racism that I speak, it’s of Sexism and Anti-Gay rights people.  Racism and Sexism have been the oldest ‘-ism’s’ in the book, yet they are not all.    African Americans still face racism in a good many states in this country from day to day.  And I, who would love to be an optimist (I’m not by the way, I live in a glass is half full world), shake my head. I shake my head at the utter ignorance that shines in the eyes of every single racist, anyone who is willing to use the “N word” or any racial slang to describe his fellow man.  It’s disgusting!  So what about Sexism?  Sexism is a huge problem not just in America but in every country around the world.  Mothers in Asia drowning their daughters because they see women as less than men.  Scorned men in the middle east throwing acid on the face of a 14 year old girl because she rejected his advances.  Women in African, the Middle East, and Far East being sexually mutilated in a practice called “female circumcision.”  The list goes on…  For what?  Why does this happen?  Because women are less than men are?  Not in my eyes, yet in the eyes of some your gender makes you less.  Even here in America where women make statistically less money than men for the exact same work and with the same education.  In America, women are considered a minority, not because there are less of us, but simply because we are have less money than white men.  Granted, I have it slightly easier than some women do, I am white.  That doesn’t make it right.   Even in my own life I deal with Sexism, not from my husband but from my father in law.  I have a father in law who believes that women should be seen and not heard.  It’s a common view among southern men of his age.  I hate it!  The man never speaks to me, and when I speak to him he neither answers nor acknowledges my having spoken.  It tends to be unnerving at times, not to mention disgruntling.  Yet in this situation I am helpless to change the factors.  You can’t teach an old dog new tricks as they say, and my father in law is never going to look at me as more than some woman married to his son.  Okay, So I believe I am through with my civil liberties rant for the time being.  The bottom line is that we all need to stop being so oblivious and cold toward the problem and treat every human being whom acts like a human being, like a human being.

       "Sports Do Not Build Character...They Reveal It." ~John Wooden    So imagine its Sunday and you're sitting in front of the television for the Super bowl.  The game is tight but great, then you come to the half-time show.  You're sitting with you kiddies -no I don't have any- and you watch Justin Timberlake groping Janet Jackson for the entire world to see.  While singing the lyrics "Gonna have you naked by the end of this song" he rips her costume exposing one of her breasts for the millions of viewers to see.  What do you tell the kiddies?  Yep that's the question of the hour.  What do you tell the kiddies?  The world has been in an uproar about the whole incident; Janet has apologized. Justin has said it was a "costume malfunction." Paul Tagliabue the commissioner of football has said he's taking back the half-time show. The FCC says its going to fine everyone responsible out the ass and check old half time shows for similar problems. MTV has apologized so damn many times that you'd think they were trying to convince themselves that they didn't know. Bob Costas said that its about time they stopped serving the lowest quotient with these half time shows.   I say; "Here, here, Bob!"  Somewhere in footballs glorious past, the commissioner of football lost control of what happens when the game's taking a 15 in the locker rooms.  I have to say that I doubt that Paul Tagliabue could tell you when it happened exactly, he just lost control somewhere in there and this "incident" is what it's taking to wake him up to the smut they have been airing for the past few years.    I mean come on; all Janet Jackson really did was take the next step.  Several years running Britney Spears has gone out there wearing hardly nothing and when he was covered half the time it was with something that was flesh colored to give her the illusion of nakedness.  Its all wrong, what the hell does Britney's ass or Janet's tit have to do with Football?  My husband Matt and I are harkened back to the days of old when Super Bowl half time was full of tributes to old players, high school and college marching bands, flag corps, dance teams, and drill teams.  Back in the days when football was the main focus of the whole presentation, not only the game but also the half time.  So I have heard it said in this past week by friends that they believe Janet Jackson did it to take the heat off of Michael Jackson.  After all the news has been focusing less on his potential child rape and more on Janet's boobs.  Yep, the good ol' news media really knows how to keep their eyes on the real news!  I have also heard it said that she may have done it to promoted her new album which is coming out sometime soon, I'd let you know when but I don't really care to look.  Whatever the reason she did it, it was wrong.  So say goodbye to smut and hello to football oriented half time shows!  I say good-ridden and I welcome with open arms the coming change in football programming.  I have also read that they are going to put a five-minute delay on any and all programs with celebrities.  They want to have time to edit out the celeb stunts.  Thank goodness!    Though I am glad this has awakened a sleeping giant as it were, I am not so pleased that this little irresponsible stunt by Janet Jackson has affected others in a negative light.  A brilliant example of that is the NBA game playoff's where Bioncé was supposed to do a show.  Apparently they scrapped her entire show and now she's going to be doing an AIDS awareness program with some Irish guy.  Another thing this stunt has affected is the broadcasting of ER this week.  They were apparently going to have a small bit of nudity and had to re-write their script or postpone the show for fear of catching flack about it from the FCC and drawing too much attention to themselves.  It goes too far if you ask me.  Though maybe this will teach us and be a lesson for celebs past and present.  Perhaps it will say to them,"wait and look what you doing and what impact it will have before you act arbitrarily."  Or maybe not, but I for one hope it does.  Stars of today need a less on etiquette as bad as they need lessons in acting and singing it would seem!  ~Kristyn

       "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." ~Unknown   As a lover of ‘old adages’ I hate the saying: “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.”  My husband, Matt, calls me the “Cliché Queen” and it may very well be so.  I am full of them; cliché’s that is.  Yet the one that bothers me the most is “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade” what the hell does it mean, really?  The best I can tell you is that it was probably, at best, some off the wall saying by someone who had very few lemons!  Truthfully and realistically, I understand it’s meaning.  When life hands you a bad deal or things don’t go your way, deal with it.  Yet I still cant help feeling like it’s a useless saying.  I do, however, acknowledge the fact that this particular saying could have been coined by someone who had more troubles than I do.  I just don’t think so.  Realistically when you think about it, would this adage help anyone?  Would it have helped the Jews in Nazi concentration camps?  Would it have helped the Russians or Chinese living under fudal, totalitarian governments?  Would it have saved the South Koreans when North Korea was trying to overthrow them?  The list goes on…  Then answer is no.  So what I have come to decide is that “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade” is a decidedly American saying.  It goes to save those few souls who burned the cupcakes for their daughter’s class and had to go to HEB and buy some instead, and the little girl who fell off her bike and skinned her knee.    So why the rampage?  I have been feeling lately that instead of dealing as the adage would suggest, most of us just push our problems aside and try to forget them.  For better or worse, most of us simply try to deny that we have the problem to begin with.  The good ol’ American way, at least under these circumstances.  Now don’t get me wrong, do not mistake me for unpatriotic, I am certainly none of that.  I just get the feeling that, perhaps, we are a country of live, learn, and deny…  Not always and with the coming of George W. Bush we are certainly a society that seeks vengeance on those who have wronged us, as a whole… My comments pertain to the individual not the whole.  So perhaps the adage “one bad apple spoils the bunch” is a better way to look at it.   Lately I have just had the feeling that in my own life I am less than successful at dealing with my problems rather than ignoring them.  So I am among those who have failed to make lemonade, and if I hear the old adage once more I am going to scream!  I’m just not that tolerant.   ~Kristyn

       "I don't know anything about music. In my line you don't have to." ~Elvis Presley (1935-1977)    I have come to believe that there is no honor left in the entertainment industry anymore!  No, this has nothing to do with Janet Jackson or Justin Timberlake (both of whom have lost whatever scrap of a scrap of respect I once and ever had for either of them); it’s about the industry as a whole.  Honesty I don’t know, perhaps my standards for entertainment are too high, yet I can’t help feeling that I have a right to demand good entertainment from those who proclaim themselves modern day bards.    I wish I could say that it is music and only music that has earned my ire, yet alas…  Music may be the one I have the most to say about, but it’s not the only entertainment industry on my “hit list”, so to speak.  So let’s begin where it would seem most logical…   Music   Even if we were to forget the fact that nearly all musicians are uneducated buffoons who get their kicks pulling stupid childish stunts for millions (yes, Janet & Justin), the music industry would still be full of crap for tunes.  Modern day music is childish, loud, annoying, and fully of lyrics that say nothing more than lude lyrics about sex, drugs, sex, violence, sex… I think you catch my drift.    As if bad lyrics weren’t enough to push my buttons, push all of our buttons, musicians insist on doing things that demean the average listener.  Michael Jackson repeatedly getting arrested for allegedly molesting little children, how many?  I have lost count… Janet Jackson exposing herself to millions of adults and children alike at the Super bowl half time show with the assistance of Justin Timberlake.  Aerosmith defiling the national anthem a few years back, musicians breaking away from their groups because they think they don’t need them anymore (i.e. N’SYNC and Destiny’s Child)… the list goes on.  I can’t help but be insulted and enraged by their lack of propriety where their fans are concerned.    On top of all of those problems with the industry and musicians, many of our modern day musicians are uneducated and make their money by selling their bodies and raunchy lyrics to the fans for 14.99 per CD and thousands per ticket.  Britney Spears for example dropped out of school in the 9th grade to pursue her music career.  While I have to admit that she had a beautiful voice, her lyrics and wardrobe –or lack there of- leave something to be desired.   Yet in the mess of uneducated airheads like Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears, I have found a shining star –my husband actually has found her.  I am about to recommend a singer to you all, go buy her music you won’t be disappointed (as long as you like good music that is).  Her name is  urlLink Norah Jones .  Her music is light and fun, her lyrics actually make sense (be still my heart), and on top of all of that she can actually sing!  He found her when watching a special about music on the Discovery channel.   What he found what that she tries to infuse her music with the Phi the magical number, 1.618.     Television   I’ve said it before and I will say it again, reality TV is for the birds.  I despise so called ‘Reality TV’ as it serves the lowest quotient of our population and serves to feed myths about American reality and daily life to the world.  On top of that, I believe soap operas –which most of us are addicted to.  I myself am a recovering soap-aholic- are only slightly better.  All in all, television has grown to be sad and uneducating, going to show that the myth that TV will lower you IQ is so much more than correct.    Now don’t get me wrong, I love the History channel, History International, A&E, Discovery, Tech TV, and the Travel Channel.  So not all TV is bad, just most of it…   Movies   Movies are getting worse and worse.  Acting is getting better and screenplays are getting worse.  There are some exceptions to the rule, yet I find myself longing for a good movie.  Matt and I went to see Mona Lisa Smile and it was the most enlightening, fun movie we have seen in a long, long time.  Still most people had the nerve to call it dry and boring… I sigh.  So all in all, I have to wrap this up by saying that everyday I grow more and more disgruntled by the entertainment industry.  The only industry that hasn’t disappointed me is the literary industry, thank the heavens!  So if anyone knows of a good movie or music please, please email me and let me know.  I long for something interesting and fresh…  ~Kristyn

       "Many can rise to the occasion, but few know when to sit down."    Tonight, along with my husband Matt, I had the opportunity to watch the final episode of  Sex & the City .  The show was truly excellent, the writers and producers really outdid themselves with this episode.  They provided the perfect ending to a wonderful show and satisfied my curiosity with the lives of Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha.  Still I have to admit that I am truly sad that this show has come to an end.    Embarrassing as it may be, I am addicted to this show.  My only regret is that I found it too late and now its over.  I began watching the show in the 3rd season, I think.  I suppose I can understand why they would choose to bring an end to the long running sitcom, Matt said it best when he stated “if they run it any longer it will go from being  Sex & the City  to  Golden Girls .”  I laughed, of course, but the mere fact that he’s right sort of irks me.   So there it is for all to see, my dirty laundry.  I am shamelessly, hopelessly addicted to  Sex & the City .  So to the actresses and actors, not to mention other fans, I bid you all adieu.  I’ll miss you.  However, I am trying to look on the bright side; I can always buy all of the episodes on DVD.  ~Kristyn

       "Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going." ~Unknown    I just can’t seem to help neglecting the bloggie!  What’s the matter with me?  Okay, so I have had a pretty hard time of it lately.  School is keeping me very, very busy!  I just started a new math class that’s just killing me right now.  I don’t think I know enough to be in this class and it’s already a pretty meager class as it is. I just feel so damn dumb sometimes.  So school is eating me alive, which really hurts!  Otherwise reading is keeping me pretty busy.  I am working on the eleventh book in the series I’m reading and its getting so interesting.    I guess I have this weird thing.  When I finish a book I feel both pleased the I finished it and a little sad that its over.  I try to tell myself that its stupid to feel that way but I just cannot seem to help it!  So now I am half done with the last book in an eleven book series and I’m not sure how I feel about finishing it. I mean that’s not really an option for me, I will finish it of course.  Still the next book doesn’t come out until October and I am not sure I can wait!  &#61516;  Its sad and depressing, I know…I’m pathetic.  Guess I’ll start reading Wheel of Time again!  Okay, so better run.  I’ll come up with a really interesting topic soon, hopefully.    ~ Kristyn

       “When I saw something that needed doing, I did it.”  ~Nellie Cashman   I’ve decided, yesterday, that I am going to be a writer.  Not a pretender, but a writer.  I am reading a book  The 38 most common fiction writing mistakes (And how to avoid them)  by Jack M. Bickham and I’ve come to the realization that my procrastination in writing, my fear of writing, my confusion about weather I’m ready to write, is all rather irrelevant if I do indeed intend to be a writer.  If I do, then I should begin to write, and forget the rest, its unimportant.  So, that is what I have decided I am going to do.    I am going to try to treat my writing like a job.  Work on it 4 hours or more a day and write down my hours.  That way I can see how often I am writing and for how long, it will also help me to keep writing.  Everyday I am going to write, and maybe some on the weekends, maybe.  I am going to try to start writing seriously.    One of my major apprehensions is that I am terrible at grammar.  I feel like I just don’t have the education to write professionally.  I suppose we shall see.  I have to overcome the fear and the angst at writing.  The only way to do that is to write.    So I, as of yet, have no idea what I intend to write.  I just know that I am going to.  Maybe I’ll start doing the writing prompts from Writer’s digest.  I got a calendar with writing prompts on every day of the year, from Writer’s Digest Book Club.  It’s really nice, so I am going to start using it, I think.  I also have several good books, including  The Writer’s Idea Workshop  &  The Writer’s Idea Book  both by Jack Hefferon.  They are full of writing prompts for every day of the learning experience.  I really believe that most of my problem stems from the fact that I am not the most patient person.  I don’t want to be an aspiring writer I just want to be a writer.  However, rationally, I realize that I have to an aspiring writer first.  It’s a progression of things, the life process of learning to be a writer, and writing a novel, short story, article, whatever.   I am also tired of being in college.  I’m 26 years old and I’m barely through with half of my associate’s degree.  Matt and I are intending to go to a 4-year college soon, but I just want to graduate.  Several of my friends from high school, with whom I no longer have any contact due to very unpleasant circumstances - have graduated from college.  My ex-husband has his master’s degree already, and his sisters are even graduated from college, and they’re several years younger than I am.  It’s very discouraging.   So I have to breath in and out, and control my impatience.  All the patience I have will pay off someday.  For someday I will write a novel, wish me luck!  ~Kristyn

       “There is nothing wrong with America - except those jerks in Washington who’re trying to run it!” ~Martha Mitchell   I have to admit that of late I have been growing more and more disgruntled with Politics and Politicians!  My husband Matt and I are Republicans.  Though these days it is growing increasingly difficult to tell the difference between a Republican and a Democrat –I started to call the Democrats Liberals, in the derogatory, which I rethought because I feel that Republicans these days do not have much room to throw stones!    The difference between a Republicans and Democrats is a very distinct one.  Republicans are for smaller central government, larger local government, while Democrats are for smaller local government, larger central government.  So why, now, do we continue to see Republicans on the MSNBC talking about social programs –which lie at the heart of larger central government?  Why now are many Republicans trying to give their all to help the poor by increasing government spending for social programs, such as assistance checks, food stamps, and medical insurance?  It irks me to no end, and that is to say the very least.  I have always been a believer that social programs are the weakness of any country.  Welfare is one of the central issues to economic stagnation.  Money is taken involuntarily from those who see fit to work for a living, only to be given to those who do not.  What has America come to?  In Great Britain, along with many, many other European civilizations, socialism runs rampant.  Democratic Socialism is still socialism.  The government will care for those that are unwilling to work –within a certain lifestyle - which is paid for by heavily taxing the working class.  It has come to my attention that nearly everyone in England is the working class.  Their economy is underdeveloped for lack of the capitalistic freedom, which is so common to the great American dream.    Though these days, with the ever growth of social programs such as welfare –especially in states such as California where a family that makes more than $20.00/hour combined can suck on the governmental tit for welfare that they believe they need- America is looking more and more like it’s cousin across the Atlantic.  It is simply wrong.    Is it not true that when our ancestors came to America they came here seeking a better way of life than that they could achieve in England under the oppression of a King?  It is true that they lived in English colonies, but the underlying reason was to escape the tyranny of an oppressive government.  Wasn’t that the entire reason for the American Revolution?  Thomas Paine said, “Tis’ time to part…” in his final words of   Common Sense  a novel which led to the birth of a new country.  So why now do we resemble the socialism of England more and more?    Capitalism is the core of our free society; politics is an unfortunate side effect.  So long as politicians run our government, we will never be free.  Such was true with Bill Clinton; such is true with George W. Bush, and such will be true with the next president to follow him into the White House.  Equally and on a separate note, why is it that the government believes it is their business weather gay people should have the right to marry?  America is the land of the free, that is why thousands of immigrants move here every year, yet our own citizens, based on whom they choose to love, are proverbially stoned in the streets by the lawmakers that have sworn an oath to protect their freedoms.    George W. Bush, the presidential candidate that I voted for, has just about exceeded my patients with politicians.  While I believe that his decision to go to war with Iraq was a just one, I am having more and more trouble accepting his ideas and beliefs.  It seems to me that George W. has allowed his religious beliefs to affect his leadership as a politician and president of the United States.  It has gone too far when a president is willing to amend the constitution to further restrict a large percentage of our countries so-called ‘free’ citizens by making it illegal to marry the same sex.    Why is it the business of Washington?  Why is it the business of some overpaid politician who cares more about voting for his lobbyist than he does for his Constituency?  So in parting, I must tell you that I am considering a change in political status.  No, I’m not going to become a politician and amend every wrong low –that would take more lifetimes that I have been given by the grace of God- I am considering changing parties.  Again, no, I am NOT becoming a Democrat, they are worse than the Republican Party I have grown so disenchanted of.  No, I am considering  urlLink Libertarianism.   Perhaps someday there will be a truly free country, I only hope it is America!  ~Kristyn

       "No one has ever found wisdom without also being a fool." ~Unknown   Well, Spring Break is nearly over, sadly!  I've had a week out of school and its felt like a day.  Somehow it just flew by and schools back in session tomorrow, **Sigh**.  Lately I've been feeling like everything in my life is just flying past at light speed and I'm standing in the center of it, not moving, just standing.  It's a very, very discouraging feeling to say the least.  Someday I will be a writer, though I am an impatient sort.  I want to be a writer, not an aspiring writer.  Still I have a lot to learn.  My grammar is terrible, and I am really benefiting from the college education I am getting just now.  Still, my impatience gets me down.  I don't want to be in college, I want to be done, and had I not procrastinated until now, I would be!  Such is life...  Still on a more pleasant note, Matt and I will not be moving until next year at least!  Three chears!  I really like where we are and so, we stay for a while longer.    I suppose that's an end to my rambling...  ~Kristyn

       "I think I am one of the few who gives our country any voice of its own." ~Georgia O'Keeffe   I really don't understand it!  Lately and at every turn life has been trying to get me down and normally I let it, but lately I just can't seem to make myself sweat the small stuff.  Life is good, Matt and I have a great relationship, and though we are not where we'd like to be, we will be someday.  I have also been rather inspired of late.  I am starting to write more, screw the technical difficulties!  I realized that if I don't just jump in with both feet and do it, I may never do it at all.  My skidish concern for weather I know enough about grammar or have great story ideas is flying out the window.  I really am trying to look at my life more positively -which is something I don't do, ever!    Normally I'm the worlds BIGGEST pessimist!!!  As anyone who knows me, they'll tell you that the glass is always way less than half-empty for me.  Normally I let life get me down, crawl into a little corner and cry... But lately I just can't make myself do it!  Three cheers for me!!!  So while I am not sure how long my new found optimism will last, I am hoping it will last a very long time.  I really like the feeling.  You only have one life after all!  On another note entirely, I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of  Incubus Dreams  by Laurell K. Hamilton.  Its the next book in the Anita Blake Series -which I can't get enough of!  Laurell is a great, fabulous writer.  I only hope that someday I can be a great writer like that!  I ordered from a girl online a picture of one of the scenes from one of the books, and it's a great drawing, I am really enjoying it.  She's a really talented artist... check out her site  urlLink purple passions .    Okay, I am going for now.  I hope that all of you are having as good a time about life as I am.    ~Kristyn

      It seems that just when I think life is all peaches and cream, I get screwed!  The last time I wrote I was a pretty happy camper.  Life was good and I thought nothing could get me down... How wrong I was.  Now don't get me wrong.  Emotionally things are peechy, but physically I could be better!  I developed in the last 4 or 5 days a terrible chest cold... I think that's what it is anyway.  I suppose it could be strep throat, but I don't think so since I don't have a fever.    Still I feel like utter and complete crap warmed over.  I am just hoping I can get over it soon.  My throat feels like I swallowed tacks, repeatedly!  Or more like I swallowed acid.  I feel terrible and if not for my throat hurting and my incessant coughing I would be okie dokie!  I can't seem to sleep and every time I lay down to sleep I have a coughing fit.  So I've been awake for days, 2 to be exact.  Somebody shoot me!  I have a history test tomorrow morning and I have to finish reading a book that bores me to sleep, which causes me to have coughing fits.  Damn!  So on other notes, my posting is picking up.  I just wish everyone else's would.  I write but I can't seem to make everyone else do so.  So what comes of my best efforts?  Not shit the way I see it.  Yet alas I try, and try, and try!  School is just not going my way.  I am about ready to call it quits for this semester and I only have 3 weeks to go.  I am not sure I'm passing Math, especially since I am pretty sure I failed my last test.  History is about to be a complete waste of time since I am not going to be able to sit through my test in the morning on no sleep and half a book read.  Damn, damn, damn..........  Okay, enough of the rampage!  Kristyn

      It's nice to find out I'm a passionate, Selfless lover!  Okay guys, take this quiz:   urlLink  Looking for Love:  Measure your love life with this six-part quiz!   This is how I scored:  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 9.  Eros is passionate love involving strong physical attraction.  It is the most constant, consistent predictor of whether a relationship will endure.  On a 0 to 10 scale you scored 0.  People who score high in the ludus category view love as a game and may be wary of closeness.  Men are more likely than women to see love this way, but that doesn't mean men enjoy playing romantic games.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 2. A high score here indicates you closely link love and friendship. Storge is not particularly passionate love, but it is enduring. And it is not related to age: both younger and older people prefer this style.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 4.  A high Pragma score means you take an extremely rational approach to love, carefully screening potential partners for certain qualities. Pragma is the least common love style.  On a scale of 0 to 10 you scored 3. People who score high in Mania are susceptible to puppy-love type relationships.  They are very insecure about their romances.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 8. Agape is the purest form of Selfless love.  It involves giving without taking and is the kind of love parents have for their small children.  Passionate love: 9 Game-playing: 0 Friendship love: 2 Rational love: 4 Puppy love: 3 Selfless love: 8  So I guess Matt's a Passionate, somewhat rational, somewhat selfless lover. Here's how Matt scored:  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 9.  Eros is passionate love involving strong physical attraction.  It is the most constant, consistent predictor of whether a relationship will endure.  On a 0 to 10 scale you scored 0.  People who score high in the ludus category view love as a game and may be wary of closeness.  Men are more likely than women to see love this way, but that doesn't mean men enjoy playing romantic games.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 2. A high score here indicates you closely link love and friendship. Storge is not particularly passionate love, but it is enduring. And it is not related to age: both younger and older people prefer this style.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 6.  A high Pragma score means you take an extremely rational approach to love, carefully screening potential partners for certain qualities. Pragma is the least common love style.  On a scale of 0 to 10 you scored 3. People who score high in Mania are susceptible to puppy-love type relationships.  They are very insecure about their romances.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 6. Agape is the purest form of Selfless love.  It involves giving without taking and is the kind of love parents have for their small children.  Passionate love: 9 Game-playing: 0 Friendship love: 2 Rational love: 6 Puppy love: 3 Selfless love: 6  ~Kristyn :)

       "Just because it’s Thursday"   It seems to me that at that moment in time when you believe that the love of your life cannot possibly get any sweeter, he does!  Just when you believe that the one person for you is as sweet as they’re every going to get, they emerge with something completely and totally loving.  In my case, that day was today.    I stayed up all night cleaning up the apartment because, let’s face it, it was a complete and total mess.  No, the word mess just doesn’t cover it; it was a complete wreck.  Not just messy but almost dirty and I CANNOT live like that –though I have been for the past month or two.  So I went on a cleaning frenzy and poor Matt retreated to the bedroom to escape my fitful frenzy.  I cleaned everything, including the ceiling fan, using the vacuum cleaner’s attachments to clean the edges of the carpet –behind the TV, under the tables, etc.  Anyway, you get the picture.  So I was cleaning all night until about 7am.  Yep, it was a mess to crown all messes!  Finally I was done about the time the sun was rising…  I got Matt up for his Physics class and went to bed.  He came home then told me he was going to go out and get this game, Fight Night 2004 that he has been wanting desperately.  I nodded groggily and told him to get me Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles while he was out, then rolled over and went back to sleep.  He left and when he returned and woke me he returned with my favorite snack, a cookie sandwich from the Cookie Factory, my game, and a present!  Anyone who knows me knows I love to get presents; they just make my day.  I also love to buy presents… all and all I am just a present loving person!  Anyhow, he handed me a box and when I opened it and pulled out all the stuffing there was a small silver keepsake box inside, it was even inscribed!  The inscription reads “Just because it’s Thursday.”  Inside the box was a small silver necklace with a “K” charm!  I love things that are personalized!  Even my purse is personalized, I bought a black handbag with a cream colored “K” on the front.  I believe my desire to have things that are personalized stems from some small well of vanity that springs within me, and the fact that my name has an odd spelling so it has always been hard to find anything personalized.  You just don’t find things on the rack that say “Kristyn”.  It’s okay, it makes me feel special so, THANKS MOM!  Anyway, I have now resorted to just having things that say “K”.  I almost cried when he gave it to me!  He bought me a gift that is something I really, really wanted, just because!  Matt is the best guy in the world and he proved that today without the shadow of a doubt!  “Just because it’s Thursday”.  ~Princess Kristyn

      Well, life is looking up again.  I haven't been inspired to write of late since I've been sick, but still life is okay.  Thanks for the words of inspiration Em, I really appreciate it!  I hope everything is okay there and that you're okay!  Easter was okay, not much to report about that.  Life has just been keeping me busy with school coming to it's close for the spring semester.  Hopefully I'll pass everything and do well on all my finals!  Not much to say, except that I can't wait for OCTOBER to get here...ah the longing for  Incubus Dreams  by Laurell K. Hamilton!  I am going to go absolutely crazy before then!!!!!  I can't take it, I'm just not that patient!  ~Kristyn

       “Individual commitment to a group effort -- that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.” ~Vince Lombardi   3 cheers, it’s  urlLink NFL  draft day!   Everyone who knows me, especially within the past 5 years, knows that I LIVE for football season!  I LOVE football!  Every year I sit, from January to September, in waiting for football season.  I even like the pre-season, which for a football fan, is a stretch.  Pre-season is the time when they play most of their 2nd stringers so that their starters don’t get hurt, pre-season doesn’t start until September…**sigh**  Matt and I awoke this morning with a great deal of anticipation for the 11am hour.  Draft day on ESPN covers the NFL Draft Live!  It’s so exciting, college football/NFL hopefuls getting jobs on national TV, showing their pride for their new teams from the first moments!  It just makes me all warm inside!  I LOVE FOOTBALL!  Though we were excited about the NFL Draft, something rather stranger befell the draft this day.  Eli Manning, son of Archie Manning, brother to Peyton Manning –one of my favorite quarterbacks- released a statement that he would not play for the San Diego Chargers.  This is unprecedented.  The SD Chargers had the first draft pick, as they had the worse season in ’03.  So we sat by, waiting with some amount of anticipation, to see if SD would draft him and let him sit on their bench without pay for the season.  They ended up drafting him and trading him to the NY Giants for Philip Rivers.  It was a good move all around.   Still, a good more or not, it was something that makes you wonder, what the hell was Eli thinking?  Eli Manning, a Senior at Ol’ Miss now player for the NY Giants was already 2 steps behind and refusing to play for the Chargers made set him back another step.  So he goes into his professional football career 3 steps back, I hope he can live up to the hype.  Yeah, he has the Manning name, but will it be enough?  I sure hope so; I really like this guy!  So now Matt and I await football season with much anticipation.  We can’t wait; it should be a good year!  ~Kristyn

      Right back at the beginning, yet that’s what it is for us!  With a great amount of unhappiness with 3rd & 3.5 edition D&D, Matt and I are back were we started about 3 years ago.  Breaking out the 2nd ed. Books and giving it another go!  We’ve decided that with all of the inconsistencies of 3rd edition, we just couldn’t take it anymore.  Something is wrong with a system that allows you to level up one level per night if challenged!  It makes me wonder if these-guys even play tested the thing!  So with a great deal of hope we turn back the pages of D&D history for a system that is truly a work of art. A gaming masterpiece in its own time, 2nd edition has been tossed to the curb for a system that frightfully and sadly could have been something great under the right game designers.  I frown upon you Wizards of the Coast!    Of course there is no offense intended for those who enjoy the system, I simply say that we don’t!  So wish us luck in our endeavor to break out the ol’ time machine and traverse to the golden days of gaming!  ~Kristyn

       Man can live without air for seconds, without water for days, without food for weeks, and without ideas for years.   I have, of late, been wondering how one goes about knowing what is so-called “calling” in life is?  I have in my life had many, many career goals and aspirations.  I even now have a new one.  I intend to be a writer.  I know I can write and love doing so, writing is like reading for me, if I do not do it I go crazy; most of the time that’s why I write this blog, to bide my time because I am not sure what else to write.  I have so much static in my head and don’t have the foggiest clue how to resolve it to words on a paper.  I have been informed that this static is too many ideas rather than the lack there of, though I cannot for the life of me see how it is different.  Either way I am left with nothing to write and no direction in which to traverse.  It’s difficult because before I decided I would be a writer I had a million ideas running rampant in my brain and now that I have decided that writing will be my life’s work I can’t seem to access all of those ideas.  Ideas, an abstract idea which for the life of me I cannot seem to grab; they always seem just a short distance away, just out of arms reach.  So again, how does one go about choosing what they will do with their lives? In my life I have wanted to be a marine biologist, an architect, an interior designer, a paralegal, an archeologist, an artist, an art historian, a historian, and a writer –among many others- and not in this order.  Equally, everyone I know has had these same problems at some time in their lives.  And when we do choose how do we know we have made a wise choice?  How do we know that the decision we have made will make us truly happy?    I have been thinking about it and what I have come to is that everyone has these same problems.  It’s very much akin to the fear that one has married the wrong person or bought the wrong house.  It is simply a decision that one has to make with the utmost belief that they have chosen correctly.  I hope that I have chosen correctly…  ~Kristyn

       "Laziness is nothing more than he habit of resting before you get tired." ~Jules Renard   Well, the draft has come to a crashing halt, meaning it’s over and done with.  It was a really good time to watch it and see where all of the young new talent will be playing in the coming years.  I am still a bit disgruntled about Eli Manning and the San Diego Chargers incident.  Though the fact that Eli went to the NY Giants is a good thing.  Kerry Collins is a average QB at best and I believe that if the Giants are to make anything of themselves in the coming year and subsequent years they will need the fresh talent that Eli Manning brings to their ranks.  Not to mention that just by having the “Manning” name he is expected to be a great!  I know I have high hopes and expectations for him, I only hope he is man enough to live up to the challenges!  On another note, school is drawing to a final end for the semester. This week and one day next week and school will be over for the spring ’04 semester.  Thank the heavens!  I am ready for a break.  My drive to attend class is zip, zero!  I just can’t seem to want to go and it’ going to cause my grades to suffer now, at the end of the semester, and for one reason or another I am having trouble caring.  I am so ready for the summer break to come it’s not even funny!  I am however taking one class in the summer, and I am taking it over the Internet.  I would just like to add that I am not taking one class out of laziness but lack of financial aide for the summer.  Matt’s taking two, both Calculus II and Calculus III.  I have pity for Matt.  There is really not much going other than that.  As I said before we are awaiting the Football season eagerly.  My favorite team of the past has gone rogue on me so I am thinking about taking up a new team, though I am not sure which one yet.  All I can say is “why would you do this to me Jon Gruden!”  To all my friends out there, please email me.  I miss hearing from y’all.  I will be emailing all of you in the next few days.  To those I sent pics to did y’all get them?  I know it’s been a few months but I always like to know if my mail got lost between here and there.  Going…  ~Kristyn

       "There are two kind's of people in one's life: people whom one keeps waiting, and people for whom one waits." ~S.N. Behrman   Well, school is finally out for Matt and I –at least for the spring- and we both passed all of our classes…though Matt was unsure about his Physics class.  I got two A’s so I am pretty happy. I actually started this semester with 15 units and finished only 6 so I have been down on myself for that, big time!  But hey, at least I finished any of it so I can’t complain too much.  I suppose I shall be glad when we are finally going to a University and I can begin to feel as though I am actually getting somewhere on my education.  So enough of this education banter. I’ve had it –at least for now.  Though admittedly there is not much else going on.  I applied for a writers group.  If they accept me then I will be able to get college credit and learn to write from a mentor.  I am actually really looking forward to it, though there are fees and I am not sure I shall be able to pay them!  Here’s to hoping, right?  I think it will be a miracle if I am accepted anyhow, considering that my education is rather meager at the time being.  There was a writer’s test, it was free, so I figured that I had nothing to loose!  Other than that I am endeavoring to read  A kiss of shadows  by Laurell K. Hamilton.  I have read the Anita books, which have me absolutely hooked- so I figured that if they’re good so too should be the Merry Gentry books.  I sure hope so.  I think I am going to go stark raving mad with the wait for  Incubus dreams  by LKH, which is out in October!  OCTOBER… I can’t wait that long!!!  Guess I’ll have to give it a try…  Otherwise, everything is just fine and dandy here.  I am trying to put more time into my writing and I hope to have several books read this summer, possibly including The Fountain Head. I haven’t read a book in like 3 months and it’s making me nuts!  Reading is an integral part of my existence, it’s like breathing - if I don’t do it I cease to feel like me, Kristyn!  So I am going to endeavor to read a few books over the summer.  Summer session doesn’t start until June 2, so there’s plenty of time.  After that I am taking only 2 Internet classes, so I have no on-campus classes, yeah!  Okay, enough is enough…   ~Kristyn

      I have to say, of all of the things wrong with the world the last thing I expected was an economic boon in the dairy industry!  It would appear that due to poor harvest of the few cows that farmers have, milk is hitting an all time high at nearly $4.00 per gallon and rising.  Experts are saying that it will continue to rise to above $4 in the summer and decrease toward the end of the year.  I like milk, I do, it does a body good and all that but I am not going to be happy paying so much for the consumable!  So, while milk does a body good it does the pocketbook bad, really bad!  So now, in a world torn my war and economic strife we can add the struggle to afford milk to our list of daily worries.  Apparently not only is milk on the rise but so are all dairy products, coffee, and gasoline.  It’s almost too expensive to live in America these days!  If the taxes don’t kill you, the price of milk will starve you to death!!!  I know what the economic “experts” say about the high prices of…well pretty much everything, but I still don’t quite understand it.  Money is becoming worth less and less.  Dollar bills may still be green, and they may still look the same, but they are worth less than post-it notes!  It almost makes me want to move to a less expensive country, I hear Budapest is nice this time of year!

      Done, Fini, finished!  Hooray!  I am so glad to finally be done that I just want to share it with the world.  I took my last final this morning and I am pretty confident about it.  I am going to miss my history class but I suppose that is the price of being done for the semester!  Okay, enough of the rant.  I should say that I have applied Matt and I for Tarleton University and am just waiting to hear back.  When I know if we’ve been accepted, I’ll let y’all know. Honestly I am pretty excited about the prospect of going to a University, finally.  Maybe then I’ll feel like I am finally getting something done.  I still have a long way to go, Matt will probably be done –at least with his bachelors- before I am!    Sometimes I worry that I am already 26 years old.  I am still in school and will be for a long time.  Okay, I am not quite 26 –as my birthday is not until July- but close enough… I am going to be 30 years old before I get out of college.  Then, sometimes, I think who cares how old I am?  It’s never too late, and you’re never too old, to get your education.  What matters is that I am finally doing it.  Still, I would like to be on with my life, ya know?  So to make a long story even longer, it looks as though we may be moving at mid August and throughout September.  Why don’t we just move in August and be done with it, you ask?  Well, there’s this little problem about out lease.  It doesn’t expire until the end of September, which makes it very difficult to move.  I wish now that we hadn’t renewed our lease.  Oh well…   So that’s all I have to say for now.  I hope everyone is as Jim-dandy and I am right now.  If you’re not, well cheer up, life could be a whole lot worse!

      In a country where morals, ethics, and standards supposedly rule our ever action, law, and way of life, America is on a serious decline in adherence to it’s very own ethical high horse.  Our claim to be a morally and religiously righteous country of good wholesome middle-class suburbanites is on the decline.    It is most likely that the citizens of other countries look on America as the holy grail of good government, while their governments have labeled us the proverbial playground bully.  Adhere to American standards and ways of life or die!    It’s wrong.  Other countries have every right we do to their own moral and ethical substructure!  They have every right we do to form their own way of life and government based on traditions that have worked for them for thousands of years.  So why does America believe it’s our right to go in and kick the ass of anyone who is different from us?  Was America not built on diversity and difference, in the common goal of escape from the tyranny of an uncaring king?  The answer is yes, we were.  Now, in light of the fact that Americans have been caught hurting peoples of other countries simply because they could, I am forced to wonder, if they have that much time on their hands, why are they there at all?  In my opinion this folly by American troops proves that our time in Iraq is coming to an ultimate needed end.    In one case, a Texas Republican Senator said that yeah, the tapes were bad but they deserved it because they did worse to our people.  In my opinion, there is no justification for what happened, none!  Americans do not do these things, Americans do not torture POW’s; Americans do not hurt others for the sake of enjoyment.  From where I stand, these actions by American soldiers make them no better than the “Enemy.”  I begin to wonder who the “enemy” actually is?  We’ve captured Saddam, so what’s left Bin Laden?  But wait, wasn’t he our enemy from the very beginning?  One would think so, especially in light of the Al-Quaida’s actions against American on 9/11.  So why wasn’t he our prime target from the beginning?  I believe that was what the UN, Germany, & France were trying to figure out.  Now it is true that Saddam Hussein was a mad man.  It was true that he was oppressing and torturing his own people for his own sick, twisted political scheming.  Yes, he was a homicidal tyrant; that was never in dispute.  Had George W. Bush just said we want him out because he’s a killer totalitarian perhaps he would have gotten more support from Congress, the UN, France, and Germany…perhaps?  So now we are looking for weapons of mass destruction and I would be willing to bet that the Bush administration will find them just in time for the election.  How do we, the little men –aka American citizens- know that the weapons have actually NOT yet been found?  The answer is that we know solely based on the word of George W. Bush and his administration.   George W. Bush, the president who has nearly from the beginning, been unwilling to tell us anything.    I am not voting for G.W. Bush again, that’s for sure!  Not to mention reports which say that George W. had an axe to grind with the Middle East when he entered the oval office.  People from the inside saying that he had intended to go to war with them from before day one.  I would believe it now, though I wouldn’t have then.  Isn’t it strange how one’s perception of the truth can change over time?

       It's strange how much you have to know before you realize how little you know.   Have you ever been obsessed?  I really don’t think that I ever have, unless you count an almost unhealthy preoccupation with Keanu Reeves.  I have, however, witnessed obsessions.  I have a friend whom is completely, totally, unabashedly obsessed –capital O- with a woman he used to date.  She’s moved on but he just can’t seem to, admittedly I have often wondered what’s wrong with him…admittedly.    Still, I have always chalked it up to obsession and moved on.  I have witnessed both healthy and unhealthy obsessions… now I fear I have fallen prey to one.  I am hoping that it’s healthy, though who knows?    It would seem that I have become obsessed with the letter, K.  At first I believed it only to be a drive to have something –anything- personalized.  When you name is spelt uniquely, as mine is, you tend to want for what you can’t have, an off the rack personalized item.  I have seen Kristin, & Kristen, but never Kristyn.  Honestly I’ve had to give up the search for a ready made me.  Now, I have fallen prey to the wear your initial on your sleeve craze!  It all started very innocently with a $12.95 handbag at Target.  Then, Matt bought me a Sterling Silver necklace with a K charm –which I LOVE!  Then yesterday, while shopping for tea light candles, I came across sticky notes in the letter K, which I just had to have, and little white note cards with the letter K and pink butterflies.  They’re so darn cute!  Now, now it’s an obsession!  My first one, and I kind of like it.  Admittedly it’s not an unhealthy, painful obsession, but it is still one.  I am a little happy about it.  I love, LOVE all thinks K.  It lends to me hope that my search for a pre-packaged self is nearly at its end.  The generic K of Kristyn could just as easily be the K of any other name, the generic K turned into my own personal pre-made me!  One more piece of my ongoing search for self… may my search by long and fruitful!

       "The two most engaging powers of an author are to make new things familiar, and familiar things new." ~Thackeray   There's nothing quite like the feel of something new...  Well, as y’all can probably see, I decided it was time to get a brand new template.  While I really enjoyed the purple and still have it saved on my computer, I LOVE to lighthouse layout!  Everyone who knows me knows that I am a lover of lighthouses!!    Now that we are on break between spring and summer –thank GOD- I have some extra time to play around with my projects & writing, including this blog.    I hope y’all like it as much as I do… oh and now, you can post comments to my blogs.  I know that a friend moved her site to Xanga to be able to get the comments feature.  Well, now it comes on basic Blogger for free!! Yipee!  Also, check out my friend  urlLink Jenn’s  blog!

       "A diet is a selection of foods that makes other people lose weight."   I hate to diet!  There is nothing in the world I hate more, except perhaps math and sad movies.  I think I hate them so much because I am the kind of person who hates to be inhibited or prohibited in any way.  I think I should be able to do just fine until I start and see all the things I just can’t eat anymore.  The inability to eat all these things nearly drives me crazy!  I can’t say what it is that drives me to only want the things I can not have, but what I can say with certainty is that the things I can eat are crap…so maybe that’s why I only want the things I can’t eat.  Take for instance the Atkins Diet, which is the one that I am trying now.  I HATE this diet, I rue the day that Matt came home telling me he wanted to try it!  Apparently he heard about it on Rush Limbaugh’s show.  Now I hate Rush too, he should just keep to the topic’s he knows about like politics and such!  I am starting to hate everything having to do with carbohydrates, dieting, and all the people that perpetrate them!  I hate to diet. I hate them, I hate them, I hate them…   Guess I deserve this, ya know.  I shouldn’t have eaten all the things that made me gain so much weight.  But, alas, I did and now I am paying the price.  Matt shouldn’t have eaten all the things that caused him to gain so much weight, but he did, so alas I am paying the price.  To make things worse, I think I am addicted to Sugar.  I know, it sounds dumb, but I think I really am.  I crave sugary things; Splenda™, Neutrasweet, all that Crap, just makes me want sugar more.  Then if I eat something sugary and cheat on my diet I feel like shit!  It’s like I cheated and it wasn’t worth it.  It’s never worth it.  I really do think it’s being prohibited that’s keeping me cheating.    Then, with the Atkins diet, if you cheat, you have to start all over again!  The point is to make your body go into ketosis and if you go over 20 carbs then it kicks you back out.  It’s pretty shitty if you ask me.  I don’t know what I am supposed to do, it’s starting to make me depressed.  I am starting to hate myself…What I do know is that I hate to diet!  ~Kristyn

       “A good writer always works at the impossible” ~John Stienbeck   It’s finally time to get on with my writing.  Matt and I have resolved to write every day for four hours, even if we’re doing research or outlining, we’re working for 4 hours a day, as of now that is.  In the future it will probably grow to be more time per day, but neither of us have held a job in years so we’re trying to get back into the swing of things.  I figure that someday I will be a professional writer –as soon as I get something published, that is- and a professional writer has to be devoted to his/her job, as a job.   Professional writers, generally writing from a home office, have to be devoted enough to sit down at their computer every single day and write, weather they want to or not.  So we are trying to treat writing like a job and I have a good feeling about our approach, I have the feeling like It’s going to work out for the best, for both of us.  I am even going so far as to keep a “Writing Schedule” of the time per day/week/month that we “work” at our writing.  I figure that in a “real” job everyone keeps time cards and such, so we are too.   I created a form on Excel that allows me to write the month, day, and time in/out that was worked.    I even have a great idea for a book, now I am just onto the writing process, which for me is a huge step.  I am one of those people who need structure in this process.  I need to outline and research, and outline some more.  When all the outlining is done, and the research is as complete as it can be, then the book gets written, and only then!  Though I have to say that there was a time when I believed in just sitting in front of the computer and writing.  I know people whom employ this technique and it works great, but I am definitely not one of them.  I require more organization.  I think it’s a matter of insecurity with the whole process, seeing is that I have never done it before.  Perhaps in the future I will become more comfortable with just sitting and writing first, plotting and organization later, but I doubt it.  The further into the process I get, the more I am going to come to rely on this preparation before I can write.  I honestly believe there is nothing wrong with that.  Everyone needs something; organization and preparation are what I need.    So wish me luck as I embark on new ground.  Sadly I cannot tell you what I’m writing about, but when it’s done I hope y’all will read it!  Chalk it up to paranoia…   ~Kristyn

       "Marriage is a series of desperate arguments people feel passionatly about." ~Katharine Hepburn   Would you say, if asked, that Marriage is subjective or objective?  Matt and I were talking about it today, and we came up with this; Marriage has no sanctity but what the two (sometimes more) people involved give to it.  In a world where pornography, swingers, cheaters, and reality TV –like “Who wants to marry a millionaire”- reign supreme, what sanctity does marriage really have, objectively?  If people will get married and divorced on Television with no regard for what a marriage is actually supposed to be who can say, with any fair amount of resolve, that marriage is a sacred thing?  If Britney Spears can get married while drunk in Las Vegas, Nevada, then wake up 55 hours later, realize it was a huge mistake, and get an annulment, what is marriage?  In today’s world, where the president is a Holy Roller who is against anything that is not white-bread down-home “American” and homosexual citizens of this “free” country are denied half of their constitutional rights based on who they would choose to love, how can we say that we live in the greatest country on the planet?  Okay, so maybe I am getting off the topic slightly.  Back to the topic at hand, what does the “sanctity of marriage” actually mean?  Take for example Matt and myself.  We are both reasonable, responsible mid-20’s who choose to be together not because we are bound by the imaginary ropes of marriage, but because we love and respect one another.  We are not together simply because we have to be, due to a little metal band and piece of paper.  If we weren’t married we would still live together and share our lives from day to day.  We would still be exactly what we are, marriage simply makes up politically correct so that the world is not aghast at our “shacking-up!”  We married one another because we honestly felt the bond that would keep us together for the rest of our lives.  Intellectually and emotionally Matt and I are a perfect match and we knew it.  So, we went to the courthouse here in town and tied the knot.  We don’t intend to break up so marriage was a reasonable step in the progression of our relationship.  For us, marriage was an objective decision that had, has, and will impact our lives, simply because we choose to respect the vows we took on February 14th, 2000.    Still there are others who marry simply for the novelty of doing so.  Others who, if it were not for the bonds of marriage, would not be together at all… like my sister Staci and her less than worthy hubby, Mark (whom I am convinced is a cheater –but no one has asked my opinion).  They are married, but would they be if not for the bonds of marriage which they took?  For them, marriage is more a matter of bondage and oppression then an objective, realistic, sharing of two lives.  They married 7 months early because she was pregnant, but I often wonder if she would have married him at all if not for the untimely arrival of Tyler Bryce.    So in short, marriage is sacred if you choose for it to be, and not otherwise.  In most cases, we came to realize, marriage is a rather subjective thing.  It is what you make it.  Matt and I have always believed that when one enters into a relationship, certain lines are drawn in the sand, either by words or actions.  Boundaries are set, and generally cannot be changed without a whole lot of work and a little luck.  Allow me to explain, if two people, Sam and Sandy lets call them, enter into a relationship and Sandy lets Sam sleep with whomever he chooses for the first 6 months.  Then when that 7th month comes and Sandy decides that Sam is a cheating dog and tries to change him, she will have no one to blame but herself.  She let him do it, knowingly, and never put a stop to it.  The boundaries were set at open, and upon trying to change them Sandy may very well drive Sam away.  Weather or not he deserves to be driven away or their relationship is even salvageable after a situation like that is debatable.  This topic inevitably drove us toward the topic of fetishes.  The question was posed, “What makes fetishes wrong or irregular?”  The answer was, society deems them so.  Still I cannot help feeling that in a world where a million people like a million different things, what the hell makes one unusual when another is deemed normal?  Why is the guy with a foot fetish a pervert when the guy who has a breast or butt fetish is a perfectly normal, health guy?  It all seems a little hypocritical to me!  Strangely, while the foot fetish guys is the weird one, the guy with a breast fetish is going to be the one in trouble when his girl friend catches him staring a Jane Doe’s chest in the mall.  The foot fetish guy can check out sandaled feet to his hearts content and no one would be the wiser.  That I find ironic.  Yet, if a man has a weird fetish, such as a foot fetish, and his girlfriend/wife catches him checking out feet, does she have the right to be jealous?  I would say she has about the same right to be jealous as the girlfriend of the “healthy guy” checking out Jane’s girlies.  Jealousy is a matter of one being hurt by their mate’s attraction to another.  So, weather a guys is turned on by a nice pair of painted toe nails or unusually perky boobs in a low cut blouse, it’s all the same, only society’s ideas of what’s different make it so.

       "So live that when a man says he's married to you, he'll be boasting."   Yesterday I was happy for Matt, today I’m happy for myself.  I just checked the admissions status of my application to Tarleton State University and I got accepted!  My status is sophomore while Matt’s is senior so he will graduate long before I do, but that will give him time to work on his Master’s degree –which he can also do at Tarleton.    Admittedly you are not the first to know.  I told Matt, since he was in the room.  Actually, I screamed and threw my arms up, which scared him nearly to death.  Then, I called my mom –who was in the shower but called me back.  Now, I am telling y’all.    I think that so far this is the happiest day of my educational life!  I am so proud of myself.  I know that Fundamental Christians would say that Pride is a sin, but with this feeling I have right now I don’t know how anyone could ever say that.  This is the best feeling I have had in a long time.  I am so excited –and a bit anxious/nervous- to be going to a University.  Now all that that’s left is to move to Stephenville, which I can admit that I am NOT looking forward to.  The housing is more expensive there and there is nearly nothing to do.  I found out yesterday that they do have an HEB Grocery store and a Movie theater (with 6 screens), so that’s something.  Otherwise all they have is a mom & pop bookstore or two.  The whole town is spread out and it’s major Hicksville!  Still, I would do almost anything to go to a University and get my education.  I am also not looking forward to moving away from my friends.  Truly I do not find it very easy to make friends so I like to cling to the ones that I have.  Right now I live next door (I mean directly next door –our doors are like a foot apart) from my best friend Jennipher –the blonde in my profile picture with me.  We have a good time, hang out, we’re really good friends.  Now I am going to be moving 80 miles away and it makes me sad!  Sorry but it does.  So, when I move I am planning to come to Waco occasionally and see my friends.  Probably not every week, or every month but definitely sometime, when I have some free time.  Who knows, maybe I’ll bring Jennipher back with me a time or two.  I don’t know, what I do know is that I am pretty sad about leaving my friends.  Counterbalanced by the fact that I am going to be hella-glad to get the heck out of Waco and away from certain other people who shall remain nameless for the sake of propriety and friendships, and family quarrels.  You never really know who might be reading this.  So all and all it’s a good day for Kristyn!

       Good things come to those who wait!”   Well, while it seems that I am not yet a Tarleton University Student –as the decision has not been made regarding my application- Matt is!  I checked the status of his application online this afternoon and lo and behold it was accepted!  So those who know us can congratulate him on his successful entry into the world of the University student.  Matt is on the road to getting his bachelors degree, and it’s all because of ME!  Little ol’ me, without me he wouldn’t even have applied yet…LOL, just kidding, mostly!  Without his diligence and hard work through these years he wouldn’t be where he is. Three cheers for Matt… HIP, HIP, HORRAY!  To make things better, I just read online that Matt’s classification is Senior.  Matt has very little time before he’ll be able to get his bachelors degree!  GO MATT!  I am so proud of him, as I am sure you can tell.  The only problems that we’re having is that we’re going to have to go down to Stephenville so that Matt can do Departmental Advising with the Physics department, and so he can take a Composition Placement Exam.  Its roughly 80 miles so it’s no short drive, 160 miles round trip!  I hope we can get it all done in one day.  Maybe while we’re down there we can look for a place to live.    I also called to check on his Financial Aid and it is apparently on its way as well.  So Matt is now officially, or at the end of the summer will be officially, a Tarleton State University student, majoring in Physics and Mathematics.   I am so glad that his app and financial aid has been accepted.  It takes a huge load off of my mind.  Now, all I have to worry over is my own application.  Hopefully soon my application will come through.  At this point I would be just as relieved to hear that I didn’t get admitted, than that I did.  I hate to stress out and this is making me stress out!  College is a huge ordeal and I guess I just didn’t realize that it was going to be so much trouble before we began the applications process.  But, now that it’s almost over, I am pretty glad that we did it.  It seems like a huge problem, but it’s almost done and I feel great for having done it and kept up with the whole thing.  I did pretty much everything for both Matt and myself.  I am kind of the house businessperson.  I take care of all of the problems, the business, and the overall red tape.  It’s okay, that way I can keep my stress down and know what’s going on, because I take care of everything.   Well, that about exhausts my good news for the day.  I hope everyone is doing okay.  Regards to all!!!  ~Kristyn

       "Definition of courage: 'Grace under pressure.'" ~Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961)   Talk about the last minute!  Matt’s financial aid for the summer just came through, at the very last minute.  You see he had to file an appeal for financial aide suspension –he had apparently attempted more hours than he had completed, by way too many.  His appeal was approved yesterday and his financial aide just came through this afternoon at 4pm.  Today was the payment deadline for the summer I semester.  Had it not come through we would have had to come up with $248.00 to pay for his class.  Thank God for small miracles!  So now we are all paid for and while we may be flat broke, we can at the very least pay for our classes.  A huge amount of stress has just fallen away from my shoulders.  I think I have the beginnings of an ulcer and this stressing out is doing me no good, no good at all.  Still, I can’t help but stress out about things that warrant being stressed about.    Matt always frowns at me and tells me to stop the worrying that it’s only making my health worse!  DUH, but I just can’t stop worrying.  It’s truly easier said than done.  However, not that that has been taken care of it’s taken a huge load off my mind.  He’s getting to take his calculus classes for both summer I and summer II.  I would really hate to be him.  Calculus I & Calculus II but he loves math so he should do well.  I myself am taking English 1301 (Freshman comp.) and National Government.  It should be a right boring semester for me, but the upside is that they are both Internet classes.  Internet classes make me smile as they mean that I can do my class work whenever I feel like it and I don’t have to attend any classroom courses.  Internet, the way of the educational future! The only down side is that they offer very little in the way of instruction as they are self paced.  If you don’t read the books and e-mail your teachers when you have a question then you’re pretty much left in the dust.  You may pass but the chances that you’ll learn anything are slim.  Take for example the Fall 2003 semester.  I took Business Law as an Internet class –I was still a paralegal major at the time.  Business Law is a hard class; it requires a great deal of instruction combined with intense reading and understanding of the concepts.  All in all it’s a damn hard class.  I made the mistake of taking it over the Internet.  I passed with a B but I really can’t say that I learned anything.  I am hoping to take more interest in my English and Government classes this summer.  I also want to get my books today but Matt is insisting on waiting until after the first day of classes.  The problem with that is that the bookstore is hell after classes begin.  The lines are an hour or more!  He is the ultimate procrastinator and it drives me crazy.  I guess I knew he was like this before I married him but still, it tends to make my stress worse, which makes my beginning ulcer hurt like hell.    Well, now that I’ve gotten that ranting and raving out of the way I’m off.  My fingers are hurting terribly today –I think I have arthritis in my fingers and because it’s always so darn cold in the apartment, they have been hurting terribly.  I can hardly hold a pencil for more than 5 minutes, typing is not as bad, but I am still in some pain.  ~Kristyn

       "All things come to him who waits, especially things not worth waiting for."   It turns out that applying for college is a HUGE pain in the a$$!  It’s turning out to be a huge problem.  I can’t seem to get my transcript from a college I attended in California.  It’s the last thing they’re waiting for, and when I called  urlLink Victor Valley College  today they told me that they seemed to have lost my file completely.  GGGRRRRRRR!!!!!!  I just want to scream and yell and call them idiots…I am getting a serious lesson in tolerance!  I am not the most patient, not at all.  It’s like, hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait! How aggravating.  So now, VVC is looking for my transcript.  They say they’ll call me and I hope they find it.  I would hate to have to send another one but I think I am going to have to.  It may be for the fall semester, which doesn’t start for 3 months but I want everything to be in line when I am ready to register for school.  It just makes me want to scream.  I can’t even get accepted or declined because of that lost transcript.  So now, I get to sit and pray for the recovery of that lost transcript.  College should not be this difficult.  I think that those of you who know me know that I am not this patient.  I am trying to get my education in English so that I can be a writer.  I really need to get out of college and on with my life, but with all this red tape I can’t even get in.  I almost want to just stay in Jr. College and get my associates degree and say fuck it to my Bachelors degree.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I know that it’s not the best idea.  I really want to get my Bachelors degree.  Well, well, well…I just got a phone call from VVC and it seems that they not only found my file, they sent out the transcripts two weeks ago.  So I called  urlLink Tarleton  and this is a problem on their side.  They’re behind and so it will be next week before they know anything.  Sometimes the problem is not where you believe it to be.  So those that I prejudged, those that I called idiots, aren’t.  The people I thought weren’t idiots, are.  It’s a small world after all…  Ahh, the waiting game, the incessant waiting, how I hate it!  ~Kristyn (with a **sigh**)

       Stupid Activity #25: Read existential philosophy: You will first get a huge headache and then start questioning your very being. ~Dr. Larry,  563 Stupid things people do to mess up their lives.    Yesterday was a very long day!  Matt and I went to Tarleton for Departmental Advising, I wasn’t feeling well, and we got very lost trying to find the school.  We had gone to Stephenville early in the year to take a look at the school and such.  It wasn’t that long of a trip, since all we did was go to the school and come home.  This time we couldn’t even find the school and ended up driving through and right out of the town!  It turns out, contrary to my first inclination, Stephenville is larger than I had believed!    It turns out that rather than having no grocery store to speak of they have 3 –a Super Wal-Mart, an HEB, and Piggly Wiggly (yes, I said Piggly Wiggly!).  They also have a JC Penny, Dunlaps, Payless Shoe Source, The Shoe Dept., Hastings, Cotton Patch, Taco Bell, KFC, Whattaburger, a movie theater, a shooting range, the school of course, and a lot of churches!  I have to say that I am quite pleased by this revelation!  I was dreading moving to a place that I thought had nothing, imagine my relief to find that they are an actual city.    Anyhow, Matt and I got very lost.  We eventually found the darn school, after a good deal of looking, and had our advising.  We’re both really pleased to be starting down there in the fall.  I am going to be an English & Sociology Major with a minor in French.  Matt will be majoring in Physics & Mathematics, no minor.  My program is 133 units base; Matt’s is 136 units base.  When you add the double major they add several more units.  Either way, we’re set to start school in August.  However, since Stephenville is something like 88 miles from us, we’re going to have to move there.  So far that has been a HUGE fiasco!  Looking for a place to live has proven to be easier said than done.  Most apartments are smaller than our current place –which is only 580 sq. ft.- and are about 150.00 a month more.  We also have all bills paid now and the apartments that are smaller and more expensive only pay water/sewage and trash.  Distressing is the only word for it.  The ones that are a reasonable size and rent don’t allow cats and we are not parting with Chummer.  Mostly we’ve run into a lot of expense and dead end. Then yesterday when we were in Stephenville I picked up one of their papers and found that these people are selling a mobile home for $8000.000 obo.  That’s a great price so we called.  It’s apparently in very good condition, though it’s old.  It was built in 1978 and has housed college students ever since, it’s also in a park.  It sounds like a good deal so we’re going to go check it out.  There’s also another place that has mobile homes for under $15,000 so we’re going to call them too.  Hopefully we’ll be able to work something out, for now it looks like Matt’s dad is going to help us out, thank goodness!  So now, the only problem is that we’re going to leave our place and get lost!  Hopefully we’ll just be able to start small and move up from there, maybe venture to Wal-Mart and back at first.  The place that we’re looking at is only one mile from TSU so it’s an ideal location.  The trick is going to be to move the week between school ending here and starting there.  It looks like Matt’s dad is going to be willing to help us move so that will be nice, we won’t have to do it all ourselves!  Maybe we can con some of our friends into helping us –hint, hint!    Someone I know actually suggested that we stay living in Waco and commute everyday to TSU.  That’s just impossible.  Matt had trouble staying awake on the trip home.  I felt like hell from not having any sleep and not having eaten in like three days.  We’re just not cut out for it, sorry Amanda!  So moving it is, though admittedly I am going to miss Waco.  I have really liked it here.  However, Stephenville is pretty close to my grandmother so I will –in theory- be able to go visit her more.    We paid $2.00 a gallon for gas yesterday!  $2.00 a gallon!!!!  It was 93 rather than 87 but still, $2.00 a gallon is insane!  Hope gas goes down by August but I have the feeling that it’s going to go up.  We’re going to have to buy gas for not only our car but also a U-haul, so I hope it goes down and helps us save our pocketbook.  $2.00 a gallon is another reason that we can’t commute.  Now, we’re going to have to go back to Stephenville to look at the place.  I hope it’s good, we really need this to be taken care of and I am going to be a basket case until it is.  Stress really bothers my stomach, and the only thing stressing me out right now is where we’re going to be living in two months.  I think I need to start eating more, my stomach has been acting up something fierce!  Maybe I’m just not eating the right things?  Anyway, that’s our life right about now, I hope everything works out and despite my stress it has been so far…wish us luck and if you pray, pray for us!  ~Kristyn (**STRESSIN’ OUT**)

       "Do or do not, there is no try" ~Master Yoda   School started today and all I have to say is that it’s going to be a long month!  The summer I session ends on July 7th and I know that by the time it gets here it will be a welcome reprieve.  I, foolishly, decided to take two Internet classes for Summer I.  Freshman Comp –which I happened to get a D in when I was 18- and American Government.  Both classes require a great deal of concentration and work, I only hope that I start doing better than I have been so far.  So far I’ve gotten a 70, a 72, and a 12 out of 20 –those are my grades, and the semester just started!  Maybe I wasn’t cut out for Internet classes.  I really have very little choice though, I signed up for them and have to finish them.  They are going to be my last two classes at MCC so I am going to try to get good grades.  Otherwise, things are looking up!  Matt’s financial aid for Tarleton finally came in.  I have been worried about it, though realistically there was nothing I could do but wait.  So I did just that, waited, and his award came through today!  Thank goodness for small miracles, I really needed this.  My stress level was beginning to rise again!    Now, about the only thing to worry about comes in the form of housing.  We have no idea where we’re going to live when we move to Stephenville.  The problem is that while the town is small it boasts a state university.  Under the circumstances, there is little housing available, so what there is available is more expensive than it is here in Waco.    Our financial aid went up a little bit, but so did tuition.  Hopefully everything will work out, hopefully!  It has so far, so I have no reason to believe that it won’t continue to…hmm, that must be my rational mind speaking.  Y’all who know me know that I tend to be a bit, oh, how should I put this, pessimistic.  I cannot help it it’s how I’ve always been.  That way I can be surprised when things actually work out.  Still, I do tend to be down when things don’t –even when I expected it!  Paint me never satisfied!  ~Kristyn

       "When humor goes, there goes civilization." ~Erma Bombeck   I thought this was hilarious, I wanted to share it with y’all… More than anything it’s a good laugh.  Check out the  urlLink Lysistrata Project  website, it’s where I got this.   You ever think about cows?   LIBERAL You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for being successful. Instead of giving your neighbor one of your cows, you write to your congressman, demanding that he pass legislation for more government programs to help your neighbor get a cow. You hold a concert to raise awareness for the cow-lessness. Barbara Streisand sings for the cow-less, who couldn't attend because ticket prices are so expensive that only people with 3 or 4 cows can afford to attend. You wear a ribbon that signifies that you care about cow-less people, even though you really haven't done anything to help them at all.   CONSERVATIVE You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. So?  SOCIALIST You have two cows. The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. You form a cooperative to tell him how to manage his cow.   COMMUNIST You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you with milk. You wait in line for hours to get it. It is expensive and sour.  CAPITALISM AMERICAN STYLE You have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows. You cram four cows into the space for one and get more cows. Cows get sick --hey, pump 'em full of antibiotics and you save money. Feed them ground-up sheep brains and you save more. Fatten them fast on growth hormone, then butcher quick before they die. Deny any link between sick consumers and your practices. Hire spin artists to dismiss Mad Cow disease.   DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE You have two cows. The government taxes you to the point you have to sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow, which was a gift from your government.  BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE You have two cows. The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, and then pours the milk down the drain.  AMERICAN CORPORATION You have two cows. You sell one, lease it back to yourself and do an IPO on the 2nd one. You force the two cows to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when one cow drops dead.  You spin an announcement to the analysts stating you have down sized and are reducing expenses. Your stock goes up.  FRENCH CORPORATION You have two cows. You go on strike because you want three cows. You go to lunch and drink wine. Life is good.  JAPANESE CORPORATION You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. They learn to travel on unbelievably crowded trains. Most are at the top of their class at cow school.  GERMAN CORPORATION You have two cows. You engineer them so they are all blond, drink lots of beer, give excellent quality milk, and run a hundred miles an hour. Unfortunately they also demand 13 weeks of vacation per year.  ITALIAN CORPORATION You have two cows but you don't know where they are. While ambling around, you see a beautiful woman. You break for lunch. Life is good.  RUSSIAN CORPORATION You have two cows. You have some vodka. You count them and learn you have four cows. You have some more vodka. You count them again and learn you have eight cows. The Mafia shows up and takes over however many cows you really have.  TALIBAN CORPORATION You have all the cows in Afghanistan, which are two. You don't milk them because you cannot touch any creature's private parts. Then you kill them and claim a US bomb blew them up while they were in the hospital.  IRAQI CORPORATION You have two cows. They go into hiding. They send radio tapes of their mooing.  POLISH CORPORATION You have two bulls. Employees are regularly maimed and killed attempting to milk them.  CALIFORNIAN You have a cow and a bull. The bull is depressed. It has spent its life living a lie. It goes away for two weeks. It comes back after a taxpayer-paid sex-change operation. You now have two cows. One makes milk; the other doesn't. You try to sell the transgender cow. Its lawyer sues you for discrimination. You lose in court. You sell the milk-generating cow to pay the damages. You now have one rich, transgender, non-milk-producing cow. You change your business to beef. PETA pickets your farm. Jesse Jackson makes a speech in your driveway. Cruz Bustamante calls for higher farm taxes to help "working cows." Hillary Clinton calls for the nationalization of 1/7TH of your farm "for the children." Gray Davis signs a law giving your farm to Mexico. The L.A. Times quotes five anonymous cows claiming you groped their teats. You declare bankruptcy and shut down all operations. The cow starves to death. The L.A. Times' analysis shows your business failure is Bush's fault.

       "Just don't give up trying to do what you really want to do.  Where there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong." ~Ella Fitzgerald   Well, it’s been a while since I’ve written so here’s the scoop.  Matt and I are doing okay; we’re swamped in schoolwork up to our eyeballs!  Matt’s calculus class is going so fast that he just spends most of his time studying.  I have two Internet classes, English and Government, which are going really, really fast.  But I think I’ve said all of this already, so on to something I haven’t said.  We went to Deleon yesterday to look at some mobile homes. It’s pretty certain now that his dad is going to help us buy a mobile home.  So anyway, we went to look at them, one was $10g, the other was $15g, and of course we liked the more expensive one.  It was 3 bed /2 bath and the master bathroom had a corner tub –oh how I love those.  Now we’re just playing the waiting game.  It’s really nice of his dad to help us, but I am feeling so STRESSED OUT that it’s now funny.  My ulcer has been acting up and it’s killing me.  I am also feeling depressed when I should be feeling happy about getting a place.  The thing is that most of them sell really fast so I am left feeling like we’re just spinning our wheels, as the cliché goes.  I am trying not to feel stressed; homes are out there we just have to look for them.  Still, I am left feeling helpless and I hate feeling helpless.  I also hate just sitting around and doing nothing when we should be looking for a place to live.  Matt’s doing everything he can, especially since he has so little time during the week, but if we don’t get moving we’re still going to be looking for a place to live in July, and that’s bad since we’re moving in the end of July.  I am wanting to go look for them we my free time, there’s a guy in Alvarado who has some in our price range, but Matt wants to wait all the way until next weekend to go look at them and the guy told him that they may be sold by then.  Matt didn’t seem to care and it really bothers me.  I am the type who cannot stand not knowing…that’s it, just not knowing.  I have to know where I am going to be living when I’m getting ready to move.  I don’t think it’s too much to ask.  So we are going to go see Matt’s dad today and talk to him about it.  We should know more about what’s going on after that.  He’s going to want to go look at the places, which he can’t do until next weekend, so now not only am I am Matt’s whim, but I am also at his dad’s.  It’s really stressing me out!  I’ll let ya know how it goes…  ~Kristyn

       "Logic is the beginning of wisdom; not the end." ~Spock Star Trek VI Final Frontier   I just, tonight, got the opportunity to watch the original  House on Haunted Hill  with Vincent Price.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  It was really nothing like the remake –thank the heavens.  While the remake was terrifying, it was also seriously lacking in content.  Movie remakes are seldom worth two nickels, they are over done and generally nothing like the original, usually that’s a problem but with this movie I it proved to be a delightful surprise.  Sadly, remakes seldom do justice to their predecessors.   Take for example  Anna and the King , a remake of  The King & I .  It was terrible, it didn’t follow the story, they added a whole lot of unnecessary fluff, he didn’t die, and in the end they got together.  What about all of his other wives, Anna’s just going to become another one of the King’s wives?  In the original,  The King & I , the king dies.  It wasn’t sad, he died, he didn’t live to fall in love with Anna.  It was a beautiful story defiled by Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.  I really wanted to enjoy it, I didn’t.  Another example is  The Count of Monte Cristo .  I loved the original; I loved the remake more!  This movie is the perfect example a remake gone right. It had all the right elements, all the right story line, and it added things that only enhanced the story, didn’t detract from it.  Tonight, I really enjoyed  House on Haunted Hill .  Vincent Price is a very spooky guy.  When the movie was over Matt asked me if it scared me?  No, it wasn’t scary but I can see how it could have been in 1959.  The effects were good for such an old movie and the story line was good.  It was only 75 minutes long, so it was not too long or too short but rather just right.  This was actually the first time I’ve seen the movie.  Matt bough me a box set of AMC Movie Classics, 24 movies, 12 disks, $25.00, what a steal!  I haven’t seen any of them but considering that I love old movies, I’m sure I’ll like most of them –if not all.    Tomorrow, Matt is going to buy me some more movies.  I got  How to Marry a Millionaire  when I got the box set and I loved it.  I was actually looking for the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection, but no one in town has it. Today, I got  The Seven Year Itch  with MM -though I haven't watched it yet. So tomorrow Matt is going to get me some more of the movies from the Diamond Collection. Probably  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Bus Stop, There’s No Business Like Show Business, Some Like it Hot, and a few others…  I can’t wait!

      I’m not going to sit here and say that I am a perfect angel and I always keep up with all of my obligations, that would be a damn lie –as anyone who knows me well knows.  Still, there are some things that I feel very strongly about.    Once such thing is my Internet group. I talk part in several Internet groups, writing groups where I contribute to an overall story with lots of other characters.   They’re Startrek based, and it’s something that I find very much enjoyment in.  Though work, and several years of membership I have obtained a command position, but there are so many issues.    I am dedicated to working them out, very dedicated.  I just wish that everyone else were.  I am not willing to let it go and I don’t think others should be either.  So call me crazy, but I’m dedicated to something that I enjoy.  On another note, I got my first assignment to the writing group that I joined.  I will be working one on one with a writer to improve my writing skills.  I will also be earning college credit.  I am really excited about it so wish me luck!  Oh, one more thing before I go.   urlLink Matt’s opened a new blog , y’all should check it out!  Kristyn

       "No one man is superior to the game." ~A. Bartlett Giamatti    It never occurred to me that technology could get too good.  I downloaded the shareware version of Wolfenstien 3D from the internet last night.  Anyone who remembers this game understands why I downloaded it.  This game was the coolist!  The begining of first person shooters, this game started it all.  Now I think I should say that I really hate first person shooters, but I loved this game.  I didn't like Doom, which came shortly after, but Wolf3D was a bad ass game, hands down!  Now after downloading and setting it up I find that it won't run on a windows platform.  So in order to play this game I am going to have to close out windows completely and run it from dos.  I've given this a try but my keyboard doesn't seem to want to work without windows.  Stupid crapy keyboard!  So now I am wondering if I should just call it quits?  Wondering if it's worth the trouble to play this awsome game?  I think I am going to give it a few more tries before I say Bonjor, Aloha, goodbye.    While watching G4TechTV I came across this really cool thing they're putting out now.  It's a joystick that you plug into your tv and it has games loaded onto it, such as pong and frogger.  Just plug it in and play, no additional game purchase necessarly.  Now you can play Pac-man on your tv with just the Joystick.  It's like a little arcade game in the palm of your hand, from the comfort of your living room.  Very cool!  So I am off to try Wolf3D once more... I really hope it works, I LOVE that game!

       "Open sesame-I want to get out." ~Stanislaw J. Lec   I know I just posted to this blog three hours ago, but I have nothing better to do.  Why is it that when you're really bored and want someone to talk to no one is available, but when you're busy or want to be left alone people just come out of the wordwork to chat?  I am so very bored it's not even funny.  I could be doing my homework, however I cannot log onto MCC website right now so there's really little point.  I've tried to call my mom and my friend Amanda, both unavailable.  I tried knocking next door, nobody home.  **SIGH**  I tried to call my sister only to find that she and her less than worth husband have changed their phone number, it's okay, I realize now that Staci would be working and I would have the rather unfortunate experience of speaking to Mark, her husband, had I gotten a hold of anyone at their house.  So now I am left, alone with my two cats -who are totally ignoring me- to ponder my existence.    Kristyn

       "A man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life." ~Christopher Morley   So here I am, sitting, staring at the computer screen.  It's 8:58am and Matt has gone to pay for our home with his dad, but lucky me, I got to stay home.  Since we just got Galileo yesterday we were concerned that he and Chummer would kick each others @$$ if we left them here alone.    I understood yesterday, before we got Galileo, but not now.  Chummer and Galileo LOVE each other.  They've been playing and having fun all night.  As a matter of fact, they're both sleeping on the bed, cuddled up together, because they played so hard last night and all morning.  It's so cute, makes me wish I had a digital camera...makes me wish I had some film for my film camera for that matter.  So anyway, back to my point.  I got left home!  Needless to say, I am not happy about it.  I have been so anxious about this move it's not even funny. My ulcer is killing me and now I'm being left home to wonder if they're taking care of everything the way I'd like and knowing that they probably are not.  Luckily, Matt's dad C.L. is really, really responsible about these things, it helps cut down my worry.  To compound the issue, I am alone at home with no car.  Instead of letting me drive him to his dads, Matt took the car and is leaving it parked at his dads all day.  What if I have an emergency?  What if Chummer or Galileo have an emergency?  GGGGGRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!  Kristyn

       "A kitten does not discover that her tail belongs to her until you tread upon it." ~Thoreau   Today Matt and I got a kitten from Fuzzy Friends Animal Rescue here in Waco, TX.  He's 2 months, 2 weeks old and is a grey and white tabby.  He is SO cute!  His name, when we went to look at him, was Dusty.  When we adopted him we named him Galileo.  It fits him perfectly.  I know, I know, your thinking that Galileo is an awfuly big name for such a small critter, but he's the most curious little guy.  He also jumps all over the place, jumping, jumping, jumping!  Jumping toward heaven, toward the stars, so Galileo is a perfect name.  We fell in love with him from the first moment we saw him.  He was the one, a perfect little brother for Chummer.  We were slightly worried that Chummer would take badly to haveing another cat in the house, but Chummer seems to really like it.  He hasn't even hissed at the little one.  They play and have a good time.  It's really very adorable.  We decided to get him now because we are moving in two weeks.  We didn't want to introduce a new environment and a new pet into chummers life.  Luckily, Chummer is taking to Galileo really well.  Thanks all that's holy!  Kristyn

       "The impetuous seed of creation does not exactly come forth on little cat feet." ~Georgianne Cowan, from "The Sacred Womb"   I think my ability to observe the unusual in everyday life is growing keener.  This afternoon, after a frusterating three hours packing, I went out to get a Blizsard at Dairy Queen.  When I was coming back, I noticed a well dressed man in a three piece black suit and shiny dress shoes carrying garbage out to the dumpsters.  Though I was not in a great mood, it made me smile.  I am chalking it up to the strangest thing I have seen, at least today.    I am dabbling in a book called  Fruitflesh, seeds of inspiration for women who write  by Gayle Bradneis.  If you're a writer and a woman, I reccommend this book.  She discusses in the introduction how the observation of a strawberry changed her life. The meditation exercises in the book revolve around the observation of different fruits.  The book is one that helps teach the power that observation has in each of our lives and how our lives can be inspired and enriched by simply seeing, actually seeing, what's around us.  It's a facinating read.  I am also currently working on my first assignment for my writing group and let me tell you I am having a blast. It's coming along nicely, though I will not say what it is and I am having a very good time.  I am also in school right now taking english and government.  I am not having the greatest time with either to be truthful.  I enjoy english, though the finer points elude me sometimes.  Government on the other hand must have been put on this Earth to torment and torture us to ultimate bordem and self loathing!  For those who enjoy government, I am hearly sorry, and not for my comments herein.    Kristyn

       "I have a mind like a steel trap. Stuff gets in there and WHAM! It never gets back out again." ~Bill Austin    Well, It looks like Matt and I will be moving to Stephenville on the weekend of July 9th-11th.  We got a mobile home, not a used one, a new one.  We’re going to go back this Friday and pay for it, then, we’re going to have it moved and set up in the park on the week of July 5th and move in that weekend.  Out move was originally planned for the end of August, then it was planned for the end of July, not it’s been moved up.    To all who know me, I’ll send y’all my new address, and my new phone number (as soon as I know my new phone #).  This takes a HUGE weight off my shoulders.  I have been stressing out big time, now I can relax, pack, and prepare for my move.  Hopefully, unlike every move we’ve made since I’ve lived here, this move will go smoothly.  Matt and I are paying a company here in central Texas to move our belongings for us.  It’s surprisingly inexpensive when you break down the cost.  The last time we moved it cost us upwards of $400, having someone do it for us is only going to cost $500 or so and they’re insured.  Meaning if they break anything, or everything for that matter, they pay to have it replaced.  It’s a really nice thing!  Not to mention the fact that it’s the middle of the summer in Texas!  Texas has to be the hottest place on the face of the earth –except maybe Ecuador.  Moving our own things in this heat will kill us.  When I was young I had severe heat exhaustion and ever since I’ve had trouble with the sun and heat.  The heat and sun have a really bad effect of Matt as well, but I won’t get into that.  So now, the only thing I am stressed about is getting everything in order in the next three weeks.  I have been thinking about it and I am not sure that the place has phone jacks, so we may have to have them installed, which is pretty expensive.  Hopefully C.L. will help us out with that if it needs to be done.  I suppose we’ll see on Friday.    Yep, this Friday, for the 4th Friday in a row, Matt and I are making the trip to Stephenville.  Then, we’ll have one or two Fridays to relax before our move.  Life is just flying by right now.  We are also both still in school until the first week of July so that is a really stressful thing as well.    All in all, life is coming together pretty nicely.  We are getting things done and soon we’ll be residents of Stephenville, TX.    Oh and did I mention that we’re probably going to get another cat?  We’re going to go look at Fuzzy Friends for another kitty today.  We want to get Chummer familiar with a little kitty before we change his environment.  That way he can adjust to one thing at a time.  So wish me luck in the next few weeks.    Regards, Kristyn

      Scandal seems to be Britney Spears' middle name these days.  I was watching a news clip on MSN today about her increasingly scandalous activities.  First, she dates a married dancer who's wife is expecting a baby and causes them to seperate.  Then she married Jayson Alexander, stays his wife 55 hours, and dumps him in a head spinning annulment.  After that, she dates another dancer, to whom she is now supposedly engaged, who has a two year old baby and a girl friend who is eight months pregnant.  Britney seems to be attracked to those guys with pregnant significant others.   I think she does it to get attention, what other explanation is there?  Either she is so stupid that she doesn't realize she's breaking up families, or she so cold hearted she doesn't care. I'm for stupid, but I am also for cold hearted.  From what I've seen, Britney is so self-centered that she can't see past her own ego.    She can sing, though what she chooses to sing leaves something to the imagination.  However, the talent to sing is really rather lowly in the grand scheme of the world.  Music is important, some people will be remembered, some won't.  She may be remembered for a while, but she's not so great as to be remembered forever.  She's todays Madonna, but she's not as good as Madonna, not as timeless as Madonna, and she won't age half as well as Madonna has!    Matt loves her, uh er...for her voice, yes, that's it, for her voice.  Personally I think shes a bit trashy.  She came from nowhere, has a little talent, and now she thinks she's the princess of the world and can do anything, moral or immoral.  Immoral is her middle name.  Someday, that uneducated, immoral, wench is going to get what's coming to her.  I hope the paparazzi catch it when it does, I'd love to see it.  Don't mistake me for unfeeling, I just do not approve of anyone who makes such a large show of ignorant stupidity.  The saddest part is that someday she's going to age and sag and get all gruffy, then where's she going to be.  She should hop off her high horse and go back to ninth grade.

       "If you look back too much, you will soon be heading that way."   I never learn!  Have you ever asked a question you weren't sure you wanted an answer to and when you got an answer it made you feel like total shit?  You ask, feel bad, then feel like a complete @$$ for asking.  This happened to me today.  Sadly, it happens now and then, though it hasn't in a very long time.  So let's just say that Matt and I were in Cameron park -at Circle Point- it was raining, and we were sitting under some trees at a stone picnic table.  I asked him why he had never taken me to Circle Point before, he just completely ignored the question, so I persisted, he blew me off, I persisted, he blew me off, and it came to a point where I guess he was tired of my asking.  He informed me that he had ...Never mind, I can't say it.  Anyway, I got upset, but I think it was my fault.  What he did or did not do before me is not really changeable, there's nothing that can be done about it, so I suppose ignoring it is the best solution.   Yup, ignoring his sorted past, that's what I'll do.  I just have trouble understanding it sometimes.  Yet alas, it cannot be helped, so why do I bother to torture myself over it?  Well the answer is easy, I can't stand not knowing everything, even the hurtful things.  **Sigh** I am so stupid sometimes!  What did I expect?  Did I expect him to have been a monk before me?  Of course not, that's silly, but I turn around and hurt when I hear that he wasn't.  God, what is the matter with me?  It's just that you don't expect to hear that your husband had once been the middle of a naked-girly sandwich right were you're sitting!  There is a lesson to be learned here; Never ask a question unless you really want the answer.  It's an old lesson, but has never hit home so many times, in so many ways, or with such impact as it has since I have been married to Matt.  Kristyn

       "Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in awareness." ~James Thurber   I am so angry I can feel the weight of the blood behind my eyes, threatening to burst to the surface through my eye sockets!  My head is pounding and my daily growing ulcer is reminding me it's still there and getting worse by the moment.  Worse possible solutions are dancing around in my head like christmas sugarplums.  Feelings of defeat and impossibility plauge me, and all the while, nothing is getting done!  I dispise being idle, I hate it with a passion.  I have to be doing something or I go crazy with a capital 'C' and getting the run around is not my best thing.  Matt's taking care of it, but not to my satisfaction...It is my opinion that he should be/have been raising more hell than he did/has.  He's trying to work the system and get everything done civily.  I say to hell with being civil, I am loosing my mind and they are shirking on their responsibility!  Crown Homes forwent their right to civility on our part when they didn't fulfill the contractual agreement to the fullest extent of it's promise.  They agreed to things they didn't give, they lied, suggestively sold, and stuffed a thousand hidden costs in the mix.  They don't deserve to be treated as well as a dog, or an ape, let alone a person!!!  So let me tell explain the ranting.  Matt and I went to Stephenville yesterday to sit around while BMH delivered and anchored the Mobile Home.  The day was a good one.  Things got done and I was feeling optomistic about this process as a whole.  We signed for the delivery, that it was level, strait, and generally stable, all was well.    Today, after getting very, very little sleep, we treked once more to Stephenville to greet the man bringing the skirting, and the men connecting the electric, water, and sewage.  When we arrived everyone was just standing around...why where they standing around?  We were greeted by the inevitable words, "There's a problem."  I wanted to stomp, kick, and cry, instead I remained calm and tried to listen to what the problem was.  Apparently when BMH had delivered the home, they hadn't set it up high enough for the sewage lines to be connected, and the mobile home was hovering over the blocks by about 6" in the back.  Then the skirting guy informed us that until it was all done he couldn't do anything for us.  Meanwhile, the contractors inform us they don't do electric, only sewage and water! WHAT!  We were told by David Wood, the bum that sold us the home, that these guys did everything for under $1000, yea right!  Anyway, everyone left with promises to return when BMH had fixed their booboo.  I almost broke into tears watching their tail lights disappear into the horizon.  This was not the plan.  Then, to top everything off, we are going to have to pay an electrician something like $750 to connect the electric, in addition to the $750 it's going to cost us to do the water and sewage...this is adding up to more than $1000.    BMH is going to fix the problem either this afternoon or tomorrow morning.  Then, the water/sewage guys are going to return tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning.  So those two problems have been solved.  We drove home, since the drive there was a total waist of time, and called David Wood at Crown Homes.  Guess what?  He wasn't in, shocking!  Matt spoke to his manager and she agreed to speak to David tomorrow regarding the electric problems.  We are hoping they'll comp us the electricity, foot the bill for that since their Salesperson gave us serious misinformation.  Onto the other problems, there is no refrigerator or air conditioner, and several of the glass covers for the light fixtures are broken.  Mostly I am angry about the refrigerator and a/c.  These are things we absolutly cannot live without!  We found out today that they're bringing the fridge either today, tomorrow, or thursday...They had better!  We also found out that the a/c cannot be connected until the electricity is on and working.  TXU, the electric co., will not be out to connect the electricity until sometime Thursday.  So we are not going to have an a/c until Friday morning...problem, Friday is moving day.  So basically we are going to have an a/c just in time for the movers to arrive.    This has been the biggest pain in the ass I have ever dealt with, hands down!  I would never reccommend Crown Homes to anyone, not even my worse enemy.  They're irresponsible and treat their customers terribly!  Ever since we've paid for the home, they've been really nasty and unhelpful.  Today when Matt talked to the manager about all the problems the house is having she didn't even apologize for the problems, she got rude with him, and informed him she would just have to talk to David about all this, it's as if she doesn't want to take our word for it.  Whatever happened to the old slogan, "The Customer is ALWAYS right?" (Especially when they've just given you $25,000 outright!) A$$holes!  I am going to file a report with the BBB (Better Business Bureau) in that region, I am also going to look around the net and see if there is anywhere I can give them a bad raiting.  I may even consider contacting a lawyer regarding their deceptive sales practices!  Now we play the waiting game and it's about to drive me crazy!  I am not sure I can do this. My stress level is so high, the potential for an anxiety attack or two is high and my ulcer is killing me.  I am going to break down before this is done, I know it.    The worse part about this is that for once I put aside my pessimism, let my guard down, hoped and wished for the best, and got kicked in the teeth.  That will teach me to try to see the glass as half-full, or the cup as overflowing.  Kristyn

       "Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves." ~William Pitt (1759-1806)   Matt and I are members of the NRA, everyone who knows us knows that.  We support gun rights, given by the second amendment, for law-abiding Americans.  This is seemingly the only freedom that is still allotted to Americans with limited restriction -unless you count the Clinton "Semi-Automatic Gun Ban."  Democrats and liberal lobbiests, such as the Million Mom March, work every day to take away our right to "Bare Arms."   In the words of the slightly radical Charleton Heston, Chairman of the NRA, "They can have my gun when they pry it out of my cold dead hand!"  My right to bear arms is, in my humble opinion, my most important right.  By law, a gun is an extention of one's personal property. A firearm cannot be taken away from its registered owner in a divorce, separation, or the like.  A gun is personal to it's owner and cannot be forcibly taken away -save in the circumstance that it's been used for a crime.    That rant being said, there is a group led by the liberal Donna Dees-Thomases, the Million Mom March.  This rally is held on Mothers Day at the mall at Washington D.C.  It has been held for the second year this year and it was a sad excuse for a rally, weighing in at a dismal 2,000 women (though Dees-Thomases claims 3,000).  This group of women should be ashamed of themselves, hiding behind the claim that they want to protect their children!  I'm sorry but that's the biggest lie I've ever heard.  These liberal activists and poor excuses for mothers, hide behind a lie and skulk around Washington trying to undermine the rights of card-carrying, law-abiding American citizens who have a right to bear arms by the very constitution, given us by our founding fathers, the framers of the constitution.  Still the dismal turn out is, as Mark A. Chestnut, editor of 1st Freedom (NRA magazine) has pointed out, is 997,000 short of coming anywhere near it's bold claim of "Million Moms."  For shame, for shame!  It does my heart good to see this, maybe the world is not going to hell in a hand basket after all, maybe...  It just hurts me to see that the opinion of our country is so low by liberals.  One liberal man, whom attended the MMM, Dick Berman said "If we had our druthers, [America] would be like England or Australia or other civilized countries."    What an IDIOT!  England is a Socialism and while that is sadly the direction America seems to be going, we aren't there yet.  If you want to live in a socialism, go live in England Dick, we will not be missing you.  I just wish sometimes we could send all the idiots to the Moon, or England, or somewhere.  The world would be a better place!  ~Kristyn

      Happy 4th of July to all you Americans out there!  I really enjoy the 4th of July.  The freedom it represents is a privledge most of us forget we have.  We celebrate the 4th with hotdogs, family, friends, and great fireworks, but do we remember why?  Aside from this day being one of the most historically significant days in the history of our country, the 4th of July bears a symbolic significance that is hard to ignore.  One this day, years ago, the declaration of independance was signed.  Years later, it was also the day that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died.    So let us take a moment to remember those who died for the formation of this freedom we enjoy so freely!  ~Kristyn   PS. 5 days to moving day!

       "When 800 years old you are, look this good you won't" ~Master Yoda   This move is going to kill me yet!  I have been trying to pack, especially now that it's  getting down to brass tacks, as they say.  No matter how much I pack, nothing seems to be getting done.  I wish I could say why, it's probably because we have so much stuff...yes, stuff, there's no other way to put it.  I never realized you could stuff and cram so many things into 580 square feet, but alas, I have been disallusioned!    So the boxes are stacking up, the pictures are coming down, and there's less than a week to go until moving day on July 9th.  The electricity in our new place is not going to be hooked up until the 8th, which makes me really glad I called today to have in connected.  There is aparently a three day wait, had I waited until Tuesday to call TXU, we would have been moving in with no air conditioning, and no lights.  No lights could be done, no electricity for A/C cannot be done.  Texas is hotter than hades in July, this July is no different from the rest, hot.  We get to go to Stephenville on Monday to sit while they spend six hours delivering, setting up, and tieing down the mobile home.  It's going to be hot and there is going to be no air, it's going to be a terrible day.  There is also no shade on the lot we rented, so sitting in the shade is a no go.  Then, we get to return on Tuesday to sit while they hook-up all of our things, electricity, plumbing, water, etc., and do the skirting.  Moving is going to kill me, really, it is.    My ulcer is killing me, theres 6 days until moving day, we have to spend 3 of them driving all over Texas, I have to do like 12 loads of laundry, clean the apartment before moving and I have no help with the packing.  I am not sure how I am going to pull this off, but I know I have to.  Wish me luck!  ~Kristyn

       "Do not fear change, for it is an unchangable law of progress."    As of Friday July 16th we are completely done moving.&nbsp; The move took longer than we thought it would, and I am still trying to find a place for everything in the house.&nbsp; The apartment we were living in down in Waco was something like 550 square feet.&nbsp; We fit everything in there somehow.&nbsp; Now we have 960 square feet and though we not as cramped, we are barely fitting!&nbsp; Everything is getting put away, slowly, and we’re getting situated.   The day we moved, Friday July 9th, Matt, Chummer, and Galileo came up here to the house early, while I waited for the mover to pack everything up and get on the road.&nbsp; When Chris, Jennipher, and I finally arrived at the house there was no power.&nbsp; We had enough problems without that too!&nbsp; Matt informed me there was power, he just managed to blow a fuse on the air conditioner and that’s why we were lacking the essential cool air that would make a July afternoon in Central Texas bearable.&nbsp; We waited for the air conditioning tech for almost an hour when he arrived and fixed the problem, which happened to be a positive hooked to a positive and a negative hooked to a negative.&nbsp; While we waited, I began looking for Chummer and Galileo.&nbsp; Jennipher finally found them in the bathtub in the front bathroom.&nbsp; The bathroom happened to be sweltering, when I asked Matt why they were cooking alive in the bathroom he said that’s where he’d taken them when they arrived and they had stayed there.&nbsp; I took them out of the bathroom and Jennipher and I put Chummer in the freezer –with the door open- because it was the only cool place in the whole house.&nbsp; Chummer wouldn’t drink the water and was acting very strangely, cat deliria I suppose.&nbsp; He began panting like a dog, so the freezer was the best possible choice, considering that it had been cooling overnight before the electricity went out.   When the air conditioning guy finally fixed the problem and charged us a service call, we had air conditioning, but where were the movers?&nbsp; I had noticed immediately upon our arrival that they hadn’t yet arrived, which was strange since they left almost an hour before Jennipher, Chris, and I.&nbsp; In the midst of the air conditioning catastrophe I had almost forgotten that they had not arrived yet, but when the air conditioner was restored to working condition I began to worry about where the mover was again.&nbsp; Finally they arrived while the a/c guy was finishing up.&nbsp;   The movers were another situation entirely.&nbsp; The driver Herb was a total weirdo!&nbsp; As I said, Matt left my girlfriend Jennipher and I to deal with the movers and I'm not sure I am ever going to forgive him.&nbsp; Herb kept telling us to smile, be happy, it was weird.&nbsp; I just wanted to get moved.&nbsp; Its not that I was trying to be rude, but we paid him for a service and talking was not it.&nbsp; He moved our things, but he just kept on talking to us while he was doing it.&nbsp; I felt like telling him, “less talk, more moving.”&nbsp; They left an hour ahead of Chris, Jennipher, and I, arrived an hour after us, and Herb went back to talking rather than moving.&nbsp; Chris actually helped unload the truck so they would leave.&nbsp; Jennipher and I were completely creped out by this guy.&nbsp; The word predator came to mind, not just mine but also Jennipher’s.   When the mover left, it was just Matt, Chris, Jennipher, and I, with a lot of boxes.&nbsp; There were so man boxes we could barely move around them.&nbsp; I think there was a total of 60 boxes total, plus a few crates, and all of our furniture.&nbsp; We went out to dinner, leaving the boxes for another time.&nbsp; Dinner was okay; we ate at a Mexican restaurant in Hico.&nbsp; I would normally recommend this place highly, but the food just seemed to be tasteless this particular night.&nbsp; Oh well, so much for having a good meal and to top it off the margaritas were very strong, too strong!&nbsp;   Chris and Jennipher left around 10:30 pm and I went to bed.&nbsp; The next morning I was up unpacking bright and early.&nbsp; I finally got nearly everything unpacked by the following Monday.&nbsp; A box lingered here and there –still lingers here and there- but for the most part we got everything done!&nbsp; Alleluia! I think I already mentioned that we went to Waco again last Friday, July 16th.&nbsp; We finished packing everything up and between our little Sunfire and Jennipher’s Rodeo we managed to get everything here…almost.&nbsp; Chris and Jennipher still have a few things sitting around their apartment that belong to us for the next time we go to Waco, but other than that we are done, finished, fini, finito!   I am still trying to find a place for the never-ending clutter, wish me luck, but for the most part everything is done.&nbsp; Matt’s dad is coming up on Thursday to see up, yippee.&nbsp; All things considered this has been the best move Matt and I have ever had.&nbsp; That’s saying a LOT for us.&nbsp; We tend to have terrible moves, possibly the worst ever.&nbsp; Still, with the movers moving all of our furniture and the majority of our boxes of stuff, we still had a lot to do.&nbsp; The apartment was not left as clean as I would have like it to be but hey, that’s life right?   I have to say that without Jennipher and Chris, this move would have been far more of a nightmare!&nbsp; Thanks guys, from the bottom of my heart!&nbsp;   ~Kristyn
