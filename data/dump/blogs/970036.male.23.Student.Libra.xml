       For those of you in the know, and that would include those of you attending the  urlLink University of Alberta  and subsequently in my immediate circle of peers, we all revel in the sheer irresponsibility of skipping class, most notably skipping an entire day of classes. If you happened to have a calendar like the ones we all had in kindergarten, you would  not  receive a shiny Gold Star for your diligence, but in it's stead a smoldering Death Star of indifference.  For the first time this academic year I've successfully completed a  Death Star Week , effectively skipping all 13 scheduled classes, and avoiding the dreariness of an accumulated 12h50min of lecture time.  Did I make the most of my well-deserved time off? Aside from cramming as much Sociological Statistics into my brain as humanly possible for my deferred Midterm - yes, I did nothing.

       Sweet, merciful heavens...I can't stop playing  The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past  on my computer. I never did finish this SNES classic back in 1992, and I'll be damned if I let another 11 years go by! 11 years of pixelated-related mental torture and that incessant low-health "blinging" ringing in my ears. B-bling, b-bling, b-bling, b-bling...ahhhhhhhhhhh, my kingdom for just  one more  heart!  It is nice to be reminded, however, that this older game is more challenging than  Ocarina of Time  and  The Wind Waker  combined.  *sigh* I might as well run across the street to 7-Eleven and pick up a cube of Pepsi, 'cause Gannon ain't gonna defeat himself.

       Ahhhahahahaa-ha!  Foiled once again by the powers that be. Scavenging through my empty cupboards for something,  anything , to appease my post-lunch-pre-supper cravings, I stumbled upon several canned goods - pineapple slices, tomato soup, and creamed corn. Alas, each of these tins proved to be a veritable Fort Knox, denying my entrance, namely because I don't actually own a can opener.  Surely there must've been something else! Inside the freezer I eye a box of microwave burritos, but, Vermillion Hells!, I don't happen to own a microwave.  Oooh! Oooh! Maybe these few pouches of  Carnation Instant Breakfast  will...er...no milk, eh?  *eyes last remaining box of  Kraft Dinner * Oh right, no milk...  *fridge laughs in response to my obvious suffering* "You've got no margarine either, fucker!"

       It has come to my attention that everything I previously knew about webpage design was wrong, black is the new white, and my Pepsi is indeed Coca-Cola.  I woke up this morning all gung-ho about creating an HTML masterpiece, but a quick search through  urlLink Google  for tips pointed out that tables were for losers, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) were the way to go.  Whereas I was once filled with joy, fondly recalling caffeine-fueled nights hand-typing page upon page of code simply to indent a paragraph, those joyous memories have now been replaced with a deep sense of shame and wasted youth now that knowledge of CSS has entered my grey matter's lexicon.  So, fuck it, I'll just use the templates provided by  urlLink Blogger .  Oh, how times change.     Currently listening to: Genuine Childs - Childs Play

       Having conceded that  The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past  is far too difficult to complete in the limited attention span I've got for it, I started to get the feeling that my burning desire to play video games for ridiculous stretches at a time had finally been quenched. Enter Blockbuster Video.  I'll be honest, I haven't rented a game in a long time, maybe even years, preferring to just go out and buy whatever game grabs my interest - a strategy which has worked wonderfully for my Gamecube, as every game I've got is considered great. But only a few of these games have left me bewildered and malnourished, blinking at the morning sun, unable to pry the controller out of my hand for  days  at a time. First it was  Resident Evil , followed by  Skies of Arcadia Legends , and most recently,  The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker . But when I walked out of Blockbuster with  The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King , I had no idea what was in store for me.  After playing it for the better portion of the past 2 days, I've got to admit that it's a really fun game, but more importantly, it's just challenging enough to make you want to keep playing and  earn  your way to the next level. And with the incorporation of RPG level/skill building elements, it appeals to that side of me which took the time to level-up  every  member of my party to 99, in  Final Fantasy III .  I feel like a kid again.    Currently: Taking a break to bathe and feed myself

       Ah, it's beginning to look a whole lot like a white Christmas after all. I woke up this morning to a  wall  of light, fluffy snow blanketing the city; at least a foot judging by how wet my shoes and pants were during my first lecture.  As I drove to the University this morning - perhaps it was the lack of sleep, maybe even the tub of gummy bears I ate the night before - the thick snow mesmerised me, and the landscape took on a surreal appearance. It felt like I was in a first generation N64 racer, with "fog" hiding all objects in the distance, and horrendous pop-up startling me at the last second. As I marveled at the polygon count necessary to render the Legislature Building in such detail, I was quickly snapped back to reality as my car decided to drive in ruts from 2 separate lanes, causing me to glide down 109 Street at a 45 degree angle.  Realizing there was no "R" button to guide my powerslide, I was forced to straighten things out the old fashioned way, preventing an untimely demise in the River Valley, and scaring the crap out of all the morning commuters around me.  On a completely unrelated topic, that's twice my future housing plans have been sidetracked by abandonment, condemnation, and demolition. I always thought the old high school would be a nice fix-er-upper, and once they tore that down I set my sights on Morrow's house...    Currently: Playing LOTR:ROTK on Gamecube

       Sweet merciful Lord, but it's nice to be back after my much-heralded  One Month Anniversary . I don't know about you, but updating this Blog once, maybe twice a week really begins to wear a guy down, and the hilarious, spontaneous, incontabulous ideas don't always flow as freely as before. I hope you enjoy the changes I've made to the site, most notably expanding my Shoutbox to 7 posts, an incremental increase of 1, from the very   vanilla  setting of 6.  This past Saturday, I, along with a few of my fellow associates, enjoyed the sweet, succulent fruits (think Asian pear juiciness) of our diabolical scheming - the first kegger I've ever hosted, and what an evening it was. The evening of debauchery could not have been possible without some quick (and inebriated) thinking the week before, when  urlLink Lambda Chi Alpha  threw their first Keg Party in several years, which saw 4 kegs of Kokanee enter the house, but only 3 get tapped!  The fine young men who organized the party claimed they did not collect sufficient funds at the door to cover the cost of  all  the beer, so when we returned to the house several hours after the party had ended, to find the doors wide open, all the lights on, not a single soul in sight, and a full keg just sitting there, we really had no alternative but to purloin the sacred silver Ark of beer and smuggle it away in the trunk of my car.  Oh, the sheer unadulterated pleasure we reaped from the days which followed, with each cryptic ransom note raising their ire higher and higher - the threats, the pleading, the eventual acceptance of their inattentiveness - and the weakening of my rear shocks with every bump I traversed.  But every cloud has a silver lining, and the party thrown yesterday was a resounding success, enabling us to collect enough money to pay for the liberated keg, enjoy many a Boat Races, and recover this morning with nary a hint of a hangover. Up until the party I'd been battling a particularly stubborn cold, though it's now become clear that the sheer volume of beer I consumed has either scared those pesky viruses straight out of my system, or rendered them incapable of performing said cold-perpetuating duties.  What a great week, and God bless the dedicated folks working on liver replacement technology, wherever you are!    Currently listening to: Matthew Good - While We Were Hunting Rabbits

Now, I'm not one who regularly follows football, but since the Oilers don't look like they'll be hoisting Lord Stanley's Cup at any point during my remaining years on this Earth, I'll take any local sporting victory I can get.  It was very apparent that the gaggle of announcers employed by CBC were residents of that moral cesspool known as Eastern Canada, as they refused to acknowledge even once that Edmonton played well, and chose to sum up the game by outlining the unfortunate mistakes befalling the Montreal Alouettes. In fact, they took a break from their post-game discussion to  kick puppies  and vomit bile from their circumambulating heads.

       To put it quite frankly,  Matrix Revolutions  sucked donkey balls on such a grand scale, that mere written language cannot properly convey the details of this unfathomable plateau of disappointment.  I, along with Steph, Bender, and Ross, hoped to curb our lingering doubts about the movie by seeing it on the Imax screen, but for the combined $66.00 we spent on admission, it would have been far more frugal to simply bathe our eyes in hydrochloric acid and walk in to traffic. For the $16.50 each, however, we were treated to a theatre experience that did not include a single ad or preview, and a tremendous screen which I could only dream of using to play one of the many epileptic-inducing shooters that Dean has in his massive collection of video games.  When the movie ended, and thank God it eventually did, the assembled viewing audience arose from their seats, shuffled towards the exists, and did so in such a silent manner that you'd think an enforced vow of silence was included in the ticket price. I had but one thought going through my head, "Now that I've seen this third movie, I  really  wish they'd only made the first one."  Bah!

       My unhealthy, crack-like cravings for sweet sauce and spicy meat has reached an all-time high, as I've begun the most insidious undertaking of my University career - the inception of and subsequent implementation of my  Edmonton  urlLink Donair  Log Book .  The budding pages of this eventual donair tome keep track of all the necessary data I've accumulated, listing restaurant locations, toppings, and overall satisfaction. Arising from countless hours of wracking my brain, I've devised three distinct satisfaction categories - Excellent, Good, and Terrible (aka rat feces). Substituting  Caesar salad dressing  for the  necessary   sweet sauce  almost instantly relegates any donair to the afore mentioned Terrible category, whereas the perfect blend of crisp, spicy meat, sweet sauce, complimentary toppings, and fresh pita will earn a much higher ranking, regardless of price, inconvenience, or resulting hours spent in the crapper for the next 3 days.  Taking advantage of my newly acquired Sociological Statistics capabilities, my log book will eventually be expanded to include numerous categories (serving size, price, atmosphere, xdays unsettled stomach) which will provide the necessary figures to plug in to my measures of central tendency and dispersion, thus allowing me to complete a parameter estimation on my overall donair satisfaction within the city of Edmonton.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to use the bathroom - for the sake of my continued research.    Currently: Heading back to Vegreville to crash Dean's "crib"

       Ted, Gido, Grandpa...all of these names I've used to describe the strongest man I've ever known, who at the ripe old age of 87, passed from this world to begin his next journey.  I had the opportunity to race down to Two Hills on Thursday evening, after receiving a phone call from my sister, Debbie, informing me that he had suffered two consecutive strokes, and it would probably be my last chance to see this beloved patriarch of the Semeniuk family, as he wasn't expected to survive another day.  In all of his 87 years, despite a massive stroke when I was a child, despite the heart surgery, and various cancers, those last few hours I spent in his presence were the first I've ever seen him incapacitated, unable to move or speak, unable to respond. It was the first time he ever appeared weary, and though he'd fallen in to a coma before I was able to arrive, I was comforted to see him at peace - stricken but not defeated.  Comforting my Baba at his bedside, with tears in her eyes, she proudly told us stories of how he was just hours earlier, struggling to talk he asked about each individual member of our family - if I was enjoying University, how all of his grandchildren were, even the secret stash of Halloween candy he'd won at Bingo and was saving for them. Even as his body continued to fail him, he remained strong willed and proud. When my Baba, wearing a cast on her arm from a fall, tried to feed him, he told her lovingly in Ukrainian, "I can feed myself...you've got enough to worry about."  I've shed many tears over this man I love, and there will be plenty more in the days that follow. His strength will always be there for me to draw upon, and his compassion for those he loved is the greatest lesson in selflessness I've ever experienced.  87 years of life, and love to spare...we should all be so lucky.

       Ahh-haha-aha--aahaaha! The simple joys of being a young bachelor are seemingly endless! Aside from spending entire days in my pajamas, nay,  weeks , the culinary arts remain a strange and forbidden realm that should only be traversed with step-by-step instructions.  However, a late-night expedition in to the "kitchen" (or area where food is supposedly stored and prepared for consumption) I happened upon a marvel exquisite in it's simplicity, and insidious in it's conception. Here's what you'll need:  01. Salted soda crackers 02. Margarine 03. Medium cheddar cheese 04. Tabasco sauce 05. Oh, and a knife or "cutting and spreading" instrument of some sort.  Put some margarine on one side of the cracker, generously cover surface with Tabasco sauce (the margarine prevents the Tabasco from seeping in to the cracker and making it mushy), and,  BAM!  top with a slice of cheese.

       Okay, so there's no way I'd really refer to Christmas as International Gift Giving Day, but it really is a shame that we, as a collective society, have managed to place such stressful, and shallow, economic pressures on the holiday season.  George and I will be packing the car up and shipping our asses back to Vegreville this afternoon, where I will then proceed to gorge myself on Christmas treats and honeyed hams -  whole  hams - for two consecutive days. During this time, the gang (which would include an assortment of chums and buddies) will attempt to throw together a road hockey game of monumental proportions, if for no other reason than to burn off the turkey stuffing and make way for Turtles, Toffifee, and Ferrero Roche, er, Fer...ro...F...ah, whatever. I just pretend they're little chocolate planets, while I,  Unicron , greedily devour their inhabitants one morsel at a time.  I would divulge the rest of my holiday plans, but the United States of America has descended in to Yellow, no Blue, no, shit!,  ORANGE ALERT , and I must observe a state of "increased awareness." I'd sure hate for some uber-Grinch terrorists to rain Anthrax down on my merry festivities.    Currently: Wondering why I didn't go to bed 7 hours previously

       In the beginning, there was nothing.  Well, to be more exact, there was nothing but my jacket/pillow and a pile of pocket change, the first night I ever slept in my apartment. I didn't even sleep in my new bedroom, but opted to test out the floor of my new living room. It was August 1, and even though I was living just slightly below ground level, the ceiling fan from the kitchen turned the living room in to an Arctic Paradise when compared with the stuffy bedroom. Quite frankly, I enjoy laying on the floor - always have. In fact, I can still recall sleeping under the kitchen table at my parent's place because it was something interesting to try out. Even my mother can attest to the fact that I frequently used to lie on the kitchen floor, forcing her to step over me while preparing supper.  Supper was one thing that my apartment was completely incapable of providing me. The fridge didn't even contain a box of baking soda, and even the ice cube tray was empty. Tagging along with my parents and sister to Costco quickly changed this scenario, though my major edible purchase was a bag of  36 frozen microwave burritos . Having no microwave at the time, I reasoned that these fine morsels would hasten my decision to purchase a nuker, because there was no way I'd wait 20 minutes to cook one in the oven.  Over four months later, and having only owned a microwave since I ransacked my uncle's basement during the Grey Cup, those very same burritos are pretty much the only thing I've got left in the place. Chicken and pork chops have come and gone. Instant mashed potatoes and Shake-n-Bake used to ruled the roost. But now, as Christmas fast approaches and I'm hesitant to re-stock my shelves before the New Year, those gut-busting popsicles of frozen meat paste are all that stand between  nourishment  and starvation.  Having eaten spicy beef burritos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, a stretch of Ghandi-esque fasting is looking more appealing with each processed bite.

       Looking back on the majority of my posts for the past month, I've noticed an alarming trend - a great deal of them deal with immersing myself in videogames. At the age of 23, many individuals would be a little sheepish to admit that such things still command frequent attention in their lives, but I'm certainly not one of those individuals. Granted, I  do  commit my energies to other pursuits, and many of these posts have gone up after late-night playing sessions, making videogames the freshest topic on my mind.  But if University has taught me  one thing  (and thank God it's been more than one thing) it's that videogames are absolutely necessary components of a healthy learning environment. For multitudes of students, and young adults in general, cable TV is an expensive luxury that can be done away with, and the Internet fast becomes redundant and dull. Between trying to juggle your course work, part-time job, and social responsibilities, videogames are a comfortable haven to focus your thoughts and temporarily escape the vying stresses of your life.  As a child of the 80's, I was raised on overtly-Conservative cartoons and videogames, so what better way to relax than regressing for a moment into childhood bliss.

       This morning I...aw, who am I kidding...this  afternoon  I was woken by one of the most irritating, persistent noises I've ever had the misfortune of audibly processing. At first I thought it was coming from outside, from the parking lot, where some jerk was running his car, knowing full well that his fan belt had fewer days ahead than already past. But no, the sound intensified as I stumbled out of my room in to the living room, where I discerned through the darkness that it was coming from my computer!  Now, I didn't piece this thing together myself, but I am aware that moving, mechanical parts are few and far between in this electronic device, and they rarely come in to play while in standby mode. Who would have thought that little 2" fan attached to my motherboard could emit such a cacophony of groans. Cleaning a noticeable caking of dust off the internal components did little to silence the problem, so I was forced to do what I used to do with the Festiva when it emitted strange clunks and pangs - crank the tunes louder.  So, with the help of iTunes and some of my favourite internet radio stations, I effectively evaded fixing the problem, and ushered my computer that much closer to the brink of oblivion before the factory warranty expires.

       As my final exam schedule nears it's completion, I can honestly say I look back on my study-time with fond memories of perseverance and determination - such as the  determination  to complete  Splinter Cell  in close to one sitting.  Now, I bought this game when it first shipped, and played it like a madman for the first week I owned it, but I recently accomplished more in the span of 48 hours than I had previously done in the past year. Don't ask me why, don't ask me how - maybe the planets were out of alignment or Safeway Select cola wasn't stimulating my neural pathways - but up until this latest surge of playing, I'd never been able to complete level 3. I was surprised, and a little chagrined, to learn that the completion of this relatively short level was anticlimactic and easy, in fact, almost laughably so. But so help me God, I could not find the guy with the briefcase before time ran out and the whole offshore rig incincerated to ashes. Fast forward 8 months, as I re-play the level, turn a corner I'd turned a hundred times, and walk right in to the guy. "Well enmity, that bastard  was  easy to find."  With newfound vigour I bunkered down for the homestretch and sneaked, sniped, and s...er...hmmm...strafed my way through levels 4 to 9. Having completed the game, I am now left with the gamers remorse, but have vowed to continue working my way though my game collection, with  Metroid Prime  clearly in my sights. But if I'm to do it, I'd better do it before Christmas, 'cause I have a sneaking suspicion I'll be getting  Prince of Persia  from Santa, you know, considering I had to walk his representatives down to the store, point the game out, have the videogame Key Master open the case, and wait while they paid for it with their MasterCard.

       One can only study Sociology for so long, you know, before ever fibre in your being screams for you to do something,  anything  else. Tonight, it just so happened to be cataloguing my video games. Now, this isn't an exhaustive list of every game I've owned, because that would include titles from the following systems:  01) NES 02) Game Boy 03) Super NES 04) Virtual Boy 05) PlayStation 06) Nintendo 64 07) Sega Saturn 08) PlayStation 2 09) Gamecube 10) Game Boy Advance  Instead, I've merely compiled the games I  currently  have in my possession, whether they be legitimate purchases or emulated ROMs. It's only a start, but I've already listed  159  games total. You can check the list out  urlLink here .  I would finish the list, but ever since Gregg mentioned Jeremy was enthralled with  Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell  for Gamecube, I dusted it off and began playing it again...and as can be expected, I am firmly in it's pixelated grasp.

       I was completely shocked and appalled to see that my good friend Gregg was  incapable  of stomaching two consecutive fast food meals in the span of mere hours. For an entire  year  I lived off nothing but fast food and water - and survived to tell about it! My rigorous eating schedule played out as follows:  Monday: McDonald's - cheap McChickens Tuesday: KFC - Toonie Twosdays Wednesday: McDonald's - cheap Hamburgers Thursday: Burger King - cheap Whoppers/Wendy's - extra value menu Friday: Burger King - cheap Whoppers/Wendy's - extra value menu Saturday: Burger King - cheap Whoppers/Wendy's - extra value menu Sunday: McDonald's - cheap Cheeseburgers  Quite frankly, I am  very  surprised that I survived the ordeal, and didn't end up morbidly obese or deathly malnourished. One thing can be certain, it most likely shaved several years off my life expectancy.    Currently listening to: Hoffman - Rewired Electronics

       Bah! That's correct, every deep rooted feeling and experience I have about the Information Superhighway can quite easily be summed up with those three simple letters.  Bah!   If the World Wide Web were, in fact, a real superhighway, like the marvels of modern engineering sorely lacking in Edmonton but found in abundance in quaint US cities like Seattle, there would be rest stops every 5 metres with magazine racks overflowing with hardcore pornography and floors littered with  pop out  advertising inserts. There would be access to bathrooms, but in order to actually open the stalls and use the toilet you'd need to pay for a 12-month subscription, where you'd then discover that an upgraded  premium  membership is necessary to get your hands on a few precious squares of 1-ply. To top it off, even regular vaccinations wouldn't save your sorry ass from catching a virus each and every time you took the motorcar out for a Sunday drive.

       Aw crap...  They say you have to have a really good memory to be a good liar, and if you tell yourself a lie long enough, it eventually becomes the truth. And I'm sure we've all experienced the sensation of waking up from a dream, believing that whatever you just dreamt (like owning that REALLY cool NES game you always wanted) has really happened, only to have cruel reality slap you in the face by the time you got out from under the covers.  Well, I'm not sure where this incident falls, but Blockbuster Video left me a message claiming that if I didn't return  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King  by midnight, they'd have no choice but to sick their goons on me. "Funny," I thought to myself, "Didn't I return that awesome game over a week ago...when it was already 2 weeks late!?" Well, to avoid reading another page of SOC 427 I began cleaning my apartment, and a very strange sensation overcame me as I stepped closer to my TV chair...like a repressed memory trying to claw it's way back to the surface. Spider-senses tingling, I flipped the chair over, and there it was, that  damn  game lying right there under the chair!  "How the fuck...!?"

       It's been quite the busy week for me at University, for a change, and I think I'm  still  at the point where I'm actively  enjoying it . Not only have I decided to take a gamble with such foreign concepts as "attending class" and "studying," but the rest of my free time has been consumed with  International Week  seminars.  In the past two days I've managed to sit in on the following sessions:    01 - The Wall In Palestine 02 - When Victims Become Perpetrators: Children of War in the Process of Peace 03 - Issues and Perspectives of Peacebuilding in West Africa 04 - Human Security: War in the 21st Century 05 - FILM - Musicians in the War Zone: A Look at the Effects of War on Children 06 - The National Missile Defense Plan: Consequences for Canadian Independence 07 - Building Sustainable Peace 08 - Edzimkulu: Rebuilding AIDS Communities in South Africa 09 - Breathing Peace (an actual seminar on rediscovering the secrets of natural breathing) 10 - Feeding off Empty Bellies: Structural Violence and the Global Economy 11 - Ending Conflict on the Roof of the World: Potential Solutions fo the Tibet Problem 12 - The Arar Case: A Public Forum 13 - Perspectives on Peace: Pride, Promises, Problems - Canada's Role in the World    That's 1010 minutes of lecture time, or just shy of 17 hours in a mere 2 days...and I've still got 3 days left!  Going to bed last night, though, would have made today run much more smoothly. I reached the sleep-deprived, nerve-rattled boiling point fairly early in my day, as a man sitting in front of me was eating walnuts  very slowly , and  very crunchily . At the time it felt like I was seconds away from going insane, but I withheld the urge to  murder  the poor soul, and slowly counted back from ten (not purposely slowly, but 'cause I was super tired) while he continued on enjoying his precious nuts.  Between seminars I stopped in the bathroom, and I really must have looked like hell to all those people around me. My eyes were bloodshot, a vacant stare glazed-over my eyes, and I was wearing army cargos, an "American Psycho" President Bush t-shirt, a ginormous wool-knit touque, and my German army parka. Either I looked like a  very  tired Faculty of Arts senior student, or a cracked-out junkie trying catch a nap indoors. The line between the two is often very blurred and indistinct.  What  did  snap me back to harsh reality, though, were the ungodly temperatures enveloping the City of Champions. On campus the mercury read -42C, and that's before the "where'd my testicles go!?" windchill effect, which made it feel closer to -50C! But really, once things dip below -30C it's so mind-numbingly cold that you begin to question just  why  our Forefathers thought this particular chunk of dirt would make a great place for a sovereign nation anyways?

       I might be accused of being the kettle who called the pot black, during this tale, but that doesn't negate my necessity to share it with you.  It was the last day of the  Imaginus  poster sale on campus, and after carefully narrowing down my poster selections from an initial 8, to an eventual 3, to an actual 2, I was politely informed that only cash or credit was accepted, and I was to take my  Interac -carrying ass directly out the door and down to the cash machines. It was standing in line at the Royal Bank Instant Teller that I witnessed one of nature's little miracles - the mysterious enigma known as  love .  Directly ahead of me in line were a boy and a girl (or young man and young woman) who resembled real-life interpretations of the characters in the latest  urlLink Penny Arcade  strip. Uber-Nerds to the  extreme , with all the social ineptitude and awkwardness that this walk of life entails. It was the first time, I believe, that I've seen such a young lady with a hunched back, and a gentleman with such a dazzling array of pens and highlighters in his front pocket. The way they stumbled shyly through two word sentences, the averted gazes to the floor and  Coca-Cola  sponsored walls, even the fact that they were totally holding up the line whilst enamored in this cosmic ballet, drew my attention to one simple truth:   It was the most beautiful thing I'd seen all day!

       Happy Chinese New Year! Wha? You say the Chinese New Year was on January 22... not  January 24!? Well then, someone forgot to tell the private Chinese New Year party that had taken over  The Fox .  To be perfectly clear, I hold no animosity towards the Chinese or their holidays, but the presence of their party at the bar effectively wiped out nearly all the highlights that had convinced me to show up in the first place. While talking to my buddy on the phone, he was very excited to reveal all the goodness that awaited me - no line, no cover, cheap drinks, cheap wings because of the Oilers game, a pub atmosphere...but with a dance floor, and a waitress who was supposed to feed us $1.50 shooters all night! In case you were keeping track of that all, it's quite an unbroken string of positives.  Unfortunately, the reality of the situation was far different: "Wha, ticket? I need a  $5 ticket  to get in? Oh, coat-check, okay, it's only a few bucks. Hmmm...the kitchen's closed, eh? It's a good thing I ate those Skittles for lunch. So, barkeep, what's the specials? Oh, no specials, but $4.50 for a beer. Sure, I think I'll get one. Hey guys, you have to pay to get in, too? You did? Well, are there at least cheap shooters? I don't think I can afford another beer. $3.00 each... *long, loud scream of anguish* "  I guess the party made all previous Saturday Night specials void. But I did get a cool red envelope at the door, and made out with the  first  monkey I saw.  An  actual  monkey,  not  one of the Chinese people at the bar. Sheesh.

       It's almost hard to comprehend, but for one of the first times in my illustrious  academic career , I'll discover what it's like to have scholastic responsibilities outside of the classroom. Unlike many students in other faculties, like Science, I don't have hours of labs, or group projects, or "homework." A large portion of my classes are simply read the books, attend a few classes, write the midterm, write the final, get decent grade.  In a way, it's rejuvenating to break these boundaries and actually do some active learning. This week at the University of Alberta is  International Week , where countless guest speakers, performers, and discussion panels, are at your disposal to learn about this crazy world we live in. And considering I'm about to finish a BA in Sociology - the official study of how this crazy world works - I can't believe I haven't taken advantage of this amazing opportunity to  learn  ever before! Topics range from "The Right to Health in the Era of Globalization," to "Human Security: War in the 21st Century," to "Edzimkulu: Rebuilding AIDS Communities in South Africa." The opening ceremonies were a melange of free-style rappers, break dancers, and poetry readings, and I was actually  enjoying  the true nature of my field of study - the one glossed over by bland textbooks and studying the minutiae of sociological statistics.  God bless my Professor, who had the foresight and determination to make attendance at  International Week  events a requirement for the course, basing several papers and exercises on what you've learned. Though I only need to attend a fraction of the events to effectively do my assignments, this opportunity has inspired me to soak as much up as possible.  So, for the first time ever, I'll enjoy an entire week of school where I have more academic hours logged outside the classroom than in. And quite frankly, I couldn't possibly have a more eager grin on my face.    Currently listening to: Coldplay - High Speed

       My, how times change. As I lined my groceries up on the conveyor belt, or Movator, or magic grocery transporter, it dawned on me just how drastically my food purchasing decisions have altered since my first year of University. The guy in line behind me managed to lose his card in said belt, so I had a few extra moments to dwell on this thought.  A sample, from my typical grocery list back when I was 18, looked a little something like this:  - Milk - Pop - Potato Chips - Tub of Gummie Bears - Jumbo bag of Dino Sours - Pizza Pops - Mr. Noodle - Bacon  That's a far cry from what I picked up today:  - Milk - Lean Hamburger - Flax Multigrain Bread - Apples - Grapes - Fettuccini - Alfredo Sauce - Lettuce  You'll notice I've added this strange and mysterious food group known as  Fruits and Vegetables , which, though purportedly healthier for me than a 5kg bag of Dino Sours, doesn't provide nearly the same sugar high and insulin shock.

       So, here it is - the hour you're supposed to be waking up and you still haven't gone to bed, haven't even enjoyed a wink of sleep. You've formulated a brilliant scheme to force your body to cooperate and adhere to a reasonable sleeping schedule, but you know it won't be easy. After all, you've still got a whole waking day ahead of you, and if you're to win this war you can't succumb to slumber until your regularly scheduled time. Why are you in this position, you might ask? It's because you've been going to bed later and later...and later...and either getting less sleep or simply waking up later and later...and later.  Ever been in this position? Ever think that staying up a long time to make yourself extra tired would actually help you get back in to the rhythm of things? But we all know what's going to happen, don't we? Sure, you'll tough it out, you'll stay up for that super-long period of time, with the lovely bags under your eyes and the inability to string more than two coherent sentences together - but then  it'll happen . You'll get your second wind! Don't deny it, you'll know it'll happen!  And there you'll be, no further ahead at correcting your sleeping habits. But hey, you'll have that zombie-like,whacked out day you just spent overtired. That's gotta count for something!    Currently - Watching a string of movies; class starts in 4 hours

       Whoa, Nelly! It's almost unfathomable, but my buddy Bender and I have managed to pull off the same fantastical feat for the second time - and pretty much on the same group of friends. Now, first and foremost, I have a very close group of friends. In fact, I've known some of these clowns before we were old enough to attend kindergarten, so we've grown to be  very  liberal with the pranking and smart-ass sass-mouth to one another. Naturally it's all in good fun, and if you can't mess around with your friends every once in a while, then who can you?  A rather large group of us had gathered for the evening at Bender's apartment in order to get "primed" before heading out to the bar. Being (what feels like life-long) University students, we've discovered it's far cheaper to have a few drinks before heading out on the town, where booze prices are even  more  dastardly than the liquor stores around campus. Most of these people were pressing pretty hard to head out to the bar, when quite frankly, the rest of us would have enjoyed staying in for the evening - probably in an attempt to master our inebriated  NHL 2004  skills.  Around midnight people started grabbing their jackets and filing out the door, no doubt in an attempt to herd us towards some God-awful dive that blared Top 40's week in and week out. Bender and I, however, had other plans. We held back, slowly getting ready while everyone else started leaving the apartment to wait around the corner for the elevator. We took so long, in fact, that they sent Ross back to grab us, but as soon as he opened the front door he saw the glimmer of mischief in our eyes.  Without even exchanging a word we bolted  the other way  down the hall to the stairwell, Ross in tow, and hurled ourselves down 8 flights of stairs, grabbing the railings and leaping to each landing. Now, Ross isn't exactly the most agile of men, and he did wipe out once or twice, but he made it out of the building with Bender and I, where we then proceeded to make our way to the Strath.  It was a brilliantly executed plan, and it was pulled off with  Splinter Cell -like efficiency - I guess all those hours logged on Gamecube finally paid off. And to the victors, of course, go all the spoils, for at the Strath we ran in to at least a dozen acquaintances who were more than happy to join us in our celebratory downing of $9.00 pitchers of draught.

       Ah yes, it's almost the end of January, and with that, a wholesale regime change at the ol'  urlLink Lambda Chi Alpha house .  Though I'm no longer an Active Member, and more like an Alumni (who just hasn't happened to graduate in the  traditional  4 academic years of study) I'll still be throwing my hat in to the political squared circle. The High Gamma, or Secretary, was one of my first elected positions when I joined the Fraternity in my first year, and it's always been one of my favorites. Though it mostly involves completing the necessary paperwork required to keep the Chapter from getting in hot water with International Headquarters, I can use it as a tool to appease that part of my psyche which demands orderliness and completeness - though a rather small part it may be.  And quite frankly, the  urlLink campaign slogan  was just too good to pass up!    Currently listening to: Three Days Grace - Home

       True to my previous post, I  did  go out of my way to watch  Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan , and it's an even finer movie than I remembered. Circumventing the need to pay actual money to watch it, I was quick to do a search on Kazaa, and within moments, started downloading the Sci-Fi masterpiece.  But the greatness of this movie is not what has inspired me to write this evening, though I'm sure I could captivate you for hours with tales of suspense and intrigue relating to those 112 minutes of sheer bliss. No, my friends, I'm writing to draw your attention towards something even more profound -  gentlemen, Mother Nature is trying to  kill us off  .  Seriously.  I'm not kidding.  Just yesterday a good friend of mine reported the good news that her sister had gone in to labor and brought another bundle of joy, another miracle, in to this world. Even before asking the question, I seemed to know the answer, but I asked anyway, "So, is it a girl or a boy?" Well, wouldn't you know it, it was a girl. A beautiful baby girl. And the world is a better place for it.  But it made me think about my own family. I'm the sole male heir to carry on the Skinner family name, and between my two sisters, they've had 4 girls and 1 boy. If I extend my family to relatives and their children, the boys are outnumbered nearly 3 - 1. This isn't just some simple family genealogical quirk, my friends, this is  very real . It only fuelled my biological paranoia when I read  Stupid White Men  by  urlLink Michael Moore  and he brought up the same scenario, with the estimated statistic that the world's population is approaching 52% female, and 48% male.  Men, obviously not the most intelligent of the two sexes, have managed to systematically render ourselves obsolete. For eons we had two things women didn't have that made us a  necessity : (1) we provided the sperm to keep the species going, and (2) we were able to reach and get whatever they needed off the top shelf. That's about it. Then,  then  we go and invent  in vitro  fertilization, and there's even work being done to use DNA (no sperm necessary!) to propagate the species. The other invention that did the male population in was the stepladder.  The portable, easy-to-carry aluminum stepladder , to be precise. Who was the bastard that came up with that bright idea? Now what possible excuse can we have for sticking around?  Nature has a way of getting rid of its weakest links, those that no longer serve a useful purpose, the dead weight. That, my brothers, is  us .  But hey, we've had one helluva run, haven't we?    Currently listening to: Radiohead - 2 + 2 = 5

       Now, I'm not going to deny the fact that I spent a great deal of my early teenage life involved in  urlLink Star Trek , whether it was catching every episode of the original series or  The Next Generation , or even dedicating countless hours meticulously painting  every single  window on my Enterprise NCC 1701-D model, but I simply can't get enough of  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan .  In fact, this movie is so good that it doesn't require any previous knowledge of the Star Trek universe - it stands alone as a complete movie, with all the drama, suspense, and action you could ever hope for. In fact, when Spock makes the very Vulcan decision to sacrifice his own life, near the end of the movie to save those of the crew, you can't be faulted for shedding a tear or two. It's a nostalgic moment that ranks right up there with E.T. dying or Optimus Prime passing on the Matrix of Leadership.  Just thinking about it gets me all worked up - in fact, I think I'm gonna head on down to Rogers Video, open an account, and rent it for this evening's festivities.

       There's nothing finer than waking up, after a few days of struggling to fend off a persistent cold virus, with a nose that isn't completely plugged, and a mouth which isn't as dry as the almighty Sahara. I could assume I would have gotten over this  much  sooner if I'd actually taken care of myself - you know, instead of going out to drink with the boys, instead of getting not nearly enough sleep, and instead of not eating anything nutritious, but who's to say? Of course, I'm really just a big baby when it comes to even the simplest of illnesses, so I guess there's no reason to brag about overcoming a few days of sniffles...  Now that the mental clouds have begun to lift after a few days of Tylenol Cold induced stupors, I look forward to keeping this site up-to-date with all sorts of stories of villainy and intrigue.

       Mwahahhahahah!  There's nothing like a little friendly competition between two companies which hold near-monopolies in their respective fields - Satan's own damnable spawn, Telus, and the exciting as dry toast, Shaw. Whereas Telus maintains it's icy grip on Edmonton's local telephone service, Shaw has engulfed nearly all cable TV providers. High Speed Internet, however, is where these two behemoths battle for supremacy.  Tired of dealing with the "customer service" whores at Telus (and hey, maybe I owed them a bit of money) I decided to give ol' Shaw a call and see if they'd throw a deal my way. Boy was I in luck. Not only do I get a free month and a reduced rate for 6 months, but they personally show up at your door to  smash your Telus ADSL modem into a thousand pieces ! These pieces are then scattered to the four corners of the Earth to quell any lingering  demons  they may have been imbibed with.

       For the purposes of this post, I'm going to take you back to yesteryear, to a time when life was carefree and happiness greeted you at every turn - yes, back to Reading Week of 4 days ago.  Now, I've got two scenarios for you, and your task is actually quite simple. Just go with your first gut reaction and answer which of the two you think would be more perilous and filled with fright and excruciating pain: 1) Being mauled to indistinction by a rabid, fucking ornery and hungry Grizzly bear, or; 2) Going cross country skiing on a sunny Winter's day? Don't think about it too much. Try not to over-analyze the scenarios. Now, what'd you pick?  The Grizzly bear gorefest?  Yeah, that's probably what my survival instincts would have persuaded me to choose too if not for an  unforgettable  afternoon of cross country skiing in Calgary's Olympic Park.  When I try to picture cross country skiing at the base of a ski hill I'd see a pleasant cardio workout involving a few mounds to overcome, but more-or-less a flat circuit that's hospitable to children and senior citizens alike. What awaited us at the Olympic Park was the snow-based equivalent of the  American Gladiators  Eliminator  . How inadequate my thin ski's felt, partlialy locked in guide paths, as my body hurled down sheer cliffs, each sporting a break-neck turn at the peak point of acceleration - which would be the point where I breach the speed of sound, nay,  light !  Thinking this would be, quite literally, a "walk in the park," and the gorgeous +7C weather, I hit the hill wearing nothing but pants, t-shirt, and toque. Perhaps this wasn't the best planning on my part, but at least the burns and holes ripped in my flesh were able to come into  immediate  contact with soothing ice and snow, you know, to prevent further swelling and bruising. In all my previous experiences downhill skiing and snowboarding I've never left a hill so battered and bruised...  ...you've won the battle, Olympic Park, but I'll return to win the war!

       Much like the fabled Punxsutawney Phil, as glorified not in  urlLink real life  but in the riveting movie  urlLink Groundhog Day , I poked my head outside in late January, perma-froze my brain and fingers in the punishing -45C weather, and decided it would be several consecutive weeks before I'd Blog again.  My intricately conceived plan to enjoy Reading Week, plus an additional few days, by having my Wisdom Teeth pulled immediately after the break and once school fired up again was utterly defeated by an under-skilled "dentist" in Vegreville. Upon seeing my x-rays he immediately threw up his arms in surrender and simply stated, "This is beyond my capabilities." Beyond his capabilities to extract 4 misguided teeth, eh? And just what late-night infomercial did he call to receive his degree!? Though I wasn't going to enjoy the remainder of my time off school, I  did   have the pleasant experience of being put under for the actual procedure, back in Edmonton.  I'd never been knocked unconscious before (unless you count the "I'm gonna live to a hundred and..." incident at George's) so I'm sure all my inquiries to the people around me were starting to get annoying. The actual experience was even  cooler  than anything I could have imagined! As the doctor injected his magical serum into my I.V., I felt a cold, tingling sensation down my arm, and a strange odour in my mouth. Knowing I didn't have much time I started to count down from ten...nine...eight...se....sev.......... out!  The very instant before you lose consciousness your eyes go all wonky and relax in completely different directions. Very cool.  Then nothing.  You don't dream. You don't experience any sensations. The hour and a half that they worked on my teeth passed by in the blink of an eye, and I opened my eyes in the recovery room. Quite literally, it felt like I had just time-traveled. I look forward to any and all future surgeries I have, just so I can experience general anesthetic again.  Just why my pants were undone I'm not quite sure, but I assume it had something to do with that $100 the Doc knocked off the bill...

       All this studying, writing essays, and completing end-of-term assignments is for the birds! Though I'm sure I've wasted plenty of time and have procrastinated whenever possible, it just doesn't feel like I'm killing  enough  time. So while we're on the topic of killing, I'm proud to announce that tonight I'll be heading out to scream in fear and excitement at  urlLink Dawn of the Dead .  I can't remember the last time I've watched a decent zombie movie.  28 Days Later  was okay, but there just wasn't enough zombies on screen at once, and not enough of those zombies were exploding into gooey, undead messes. I've mastered all the  urlLink Resident Evil  games, so my love for zombies does run deep, though the majority of the fear in those games was induced by the inability to move your character in an easy, fast manner.  Nonetheless, tonight should be a fun time, and I expect far more campy laughs than that  urlLink Jesus  movie had.    Currently listening to: Pearl Jam - Once

       The extent to which I can be frugal and cost-effective seemingly knows no bounds - at times. A while ago I was faced with a very disturbing dilemma. During one of our many visits to  Value Village  for fantastic bargains, Jeremy and I happened upon an orange  urlLink Che Guevara  shirt, vintage, straight from Cuba. It was one of the most unique finds at the time, which was before the mass-market push of Che shirts, which can now be found at nearly every t-shirt shop and mall kiosk.  I'll be honest, I wore my Value Village Che shirt quite a lot. I wore it so often, in fact, that the ancient colours started to fade with each subsequent wash. It was a gradual change that I never really took note of. It's kinda like how you don't notice a change in your friend if you see him on a regular basis, but go a month or two, and suddenly you remark "Man, you've changed alot since I last saw you! How'd you pack on those extra 50lbs!?" So yeah, it wasn't until a co-worker of mine at Tri-City Drilling questioned just  why  I was wearing a light pink shirt that I finally took notice.  It's true. The vibrant orange had faded to a dull pink, making the shirt bland and almost unwearable. Now, most people would simply dispose of a shirt that cost them $2.99, but no, I couldn't bear the thought. So one hour and one packet of orange  urlLink RIT  dye later, I had a  brand new  t-shirt and the legend of Che will continue to live on!

       Between cleaning my apartment, doing my laundry, lazing about at Nicole's, and surfing the internet, I was beginning to run out of things to eat up my time before I seriously tackled a few semester-end projects. Normally I'd throw in a healthy dose of Gamecube to consume any productive hours I had remaining, but after a week of not playing, Nicole was so rabid to play  Animal Crossing  that come hell or high water there was no way I could refuse her subtle coercion to lend her my precious Cube.  Enter Nintendo 64 from stage left.  I haven't hooked up this 64-bit cartridge-based beast in over a year, but let me tell you, a few rounds of  Mario Kart 64  or a few levels of  Goldeneye  was more than sufficient to appease my videogame hunger. Between the two controllers, one has a loose analog stick from overuse, while the other has sticky buttons from New Year's champagne, back in 1998, over at Dean's place. But hey, beggars can't be choosers, and I can only get my ass kicked at UT2004 so many times before I declare competition against those hardcore computer nerds beyond the scope of  human  capability.

       To be completely honest, between work and the pressures of wrapping up another successful year at University, I haven't got much to talk about today. One of the more interesting developments this week has been Lambda Chi Alpha's winning of a student group contest at Boston Pizza on Whyte Avenue.  Looking to save a few bucks, one member discovered that if you register your student group at BP's you get 10% off your total bill. In theory you're supposed to have at least 6 members at the table to receive the discount, but they've been  very  flexible with this stipulation. This program was actually a contest, and the student group spending the most money would be rewarded with an evening in the Party Room and a $1000 tab!  Let me repeat that.  A $1000 tab!   We were informed  of our victory on Monday. Now, seeing as how Lambda Chi Alpha has less than 30 Active Members this year, we'll assume that around 20 people will be available to finish off this tab. That's  still  $50/person! That's enough for  everyone  to order a Team Pitcher  and  a steak! I don't know about you, but this is a pretty amazing windfall for a group of University students who were looking to save a buck or two for supper.

       There's only  one  thing worse than missing a vital Oilers vs Stars game because you're at work all night...it's making your way home after a long night at work, discovering that the game is in  sudden death overtime , and the second you turn on the radio you hear, "Guerin scores! The Oilers lose 4-3!"  On a completely unrelated note, I made a call to a  Mr. Khan  in California tonight......    Currently listening to:  urlLink KHAN!

       Joy of joys, my phone has  finally  been reconnected...and all I had to do was wait  an  entire  month  from the time I paid off my outstanding balance with Telus! It never ceases to amaze me that, when owing a heartless commercial monopoly money, their organizational skills and "customer service" departments are quick to mobilize, efficient, and dare I say, downright ruthless in their execution. And yet, once they've collected their money, much like a corporate Jeckyl & Hide, they revert to their inept, bumbling ways, which would explain the month-long wait to have some Telus technician stop by my apartment, wave his magic wand, and reconnect my phone.  They disconnected my line with the push of a button...couldn't they just push the green button, which I whimsically assume resides beside the flashing red disconnect one, to restore my service?  It's nice to put this entire fiasco behind me, though, as I've been running out of nasty things to say about Telus without sounding like a broken record. Entire conversations with friends, family and co-workers have been reduced to automated rants, and like any post or pre-game hockey interview, I was running out of new slanderous hell-fire to spew forth about this company.

       Well then! I was in the midst of updating this old Blog for the first time since March 1, but more important and pressing matters have arisen and I'm on my way out the door.  I had planned on commenting on my  new job  or even the fantastic season of  ball hockey  I've been engaged in with the gang from Vegreville, but I'll wrap this up quickly: the job pays decent and is only moderately zombifying, and those blue street hockey balls are the greatest thing we've adopted since protective goalie equipment. And while I'm bringing up goalies, it's a shame that Russel, our other vetran all-star goaltender, felt inadequate without adding an additional 3 inches. It's still how you use what you've got, Russ, but more power to you, I suppose.  Updated, on the right, the movies I've watched lately and my  Ball Hockey Statistics  from this season of minding the twine. Ugh...that indoor record just won't do!

       Someone remind me not to try and "lead a healthy lifestyle" once I hit 30, because even an hour of physical exertion is enough, at the age of 23, to incapacitate me for days!  Though much has been said about the  hours  of back-breaking labour all my buddies logged simply to clear the snow for our game of ball hockey, I'd like to put those unfounded concerns aside and address my current situation. It's been months since we've gathered together to play even a single game, and though we're all fairly healthy young men, I wouldn't go so far as to say any of us adhere to an active lifestyle, so an afternoon of running around is quite a shock to the system. I couldn't imagine having to actually run around, but as an All Star goaltender, I've got a few specific taxations on my body - namely the weight of my equipment and the constant kneeling down/standing up (or, well, flopping around) necessary to be effective (I use the term loosely).  It's not the day of the game which you're concerned about, it's the  next  morning that truly sucks. I've been hobbling around like an old man with two peg legs and the bruises up and down the back of my legs from the pad straps only seem to increase in tenderness.  But as much as I like to bitch and moan, the sheer enjoyment from getting the gang together for an afternoon of heated competition is worth the resulting recovery time, and a few bruises and stiff legs only serve as an encouragement to make sure these games happen with an increased regularity. So here's the all the young, but aging, Backyard Warriors and their foolish exploits yet to come! Ha-zah!    Currently listening to: AIR - How Does It Make You Feel?

       This past weekend, saw another Easter Sunday come and go, and with this special time, another family dinner of astronomical proportions, where family and in-laws are to be avoided at all costs, and the presence of left-overs is completely unacceptable.  With my parents heading for the hills to visit my sister in Revelstoke, and my other sister heading down to Calgary, it looked like I'd have to fend for myself, though this situation turned out to be easily rectified. In the welcoming comforts of Nicole's family, I gorged myself on ham and turkey, mashed potatoes and salad, and enough gravy to enlarge your heart. What made this meal even more special was that it was pot-luck, and Nicole and I's contribution was the East Indian dish  Aloo Gobi . It was our first time preparing the dish, and through luck or skill, it turned out to be a hit.  It's a simple  urlLink vegetarian dish  that doesn't cost all that much to make, and has the capacity to fill you up quite nicely. Depending on your tastes it can pack a decent amount of heat, and it's the perfect compliment to  tandoori chicken  or whatever else you desire. I got the recipe off my sister, and through I don't quite think she divulged all her secrets, she certainly put Nicole and I on the right path.  I look forward to experimenting a bit more in the kitchen, as Shake'n'Bake is starting to gross me out, and cereal shouldn't be considered a "meal" more than twice in one day.

       Ha-zah, I say!  Ha-zah!  I received one of my most favourable marks this past week, and it concerns a commentary paper I was writing for my Globalization course. I'll be completely honest - this assignment had me on the ropes. I didn't really know what I was going to talk about, and I didn't really make a solid outline before hand, so I kinda winged it during one frantic night of caffeine-fueled typing.  When all was said and done, I was left with 4 pages of what could be considered  pure bullshit  or  pure genius . There really was no middle-ground, as far as I could see. Now that I've received my mark, I can officially declare that it was pure  genius ...or a level of bullshit so incomprehensible that my professor had no choice but to reward the ballsy endeavour with an equally absurd mark: 19.5/20.0    Currently listening to: Bush - Monkey

       I'm not about to begin arguing politics here, or try to sway your perception of Ralph Klein's provincial government here in Alberta, but I'd like to state that they've been nothing but kind to me when it comes to my student loans. During the summer, as I was getting ready to start making a few payments, I was informed that the provincial government had paid off my  entire  outstanding balance with Edulinx, a debt load of nearly  $7000!  I made sure to get a conformation of that in writing, as I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I hadn't applied for any special debt relief, and I'm not even finished with school yet - I was simply taking a year off.  Then this month I get a statement from Royal Bank, who holds the other half of my student loans. Once again, the provincial government, seemingly out of the blue, has seen fit to pay nearly  $5000  off my loans! I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm sure not complaining about it.  Who knows, if I stay in University long enough they might just clear up  all  my debts!     Currently: Shaking and mumbling from not having gone to bed yet.

       Ah yes, the magnificent final weeks of another academic semester at the  urlLink University of Alberta . What precipitates this particular point in being so poignant, you ask? Why, it's the necessity to push your body and your mind to extraordinary plateaus in order to complete end-of-term papers and cram your noodle with enough knowledge to ace final exams, that's what!  Now, I may be a humble Arts student, and a wishy-washy  Sociology  student at that, but I've got my fair share of pressures during this time of the year. There comes a time when I  have  to complete those essays I've been putting off "until I'm hit with a surge of  creativity ," and  finally  crack open those over-priced textbooks I bought, a time which incidentally happens to be right about now. So if it seems like I'm avoiding you, or have dropped off the face of the earth, please don't take it personally, because it's simply that I'm engrossed with schoolwork. I've enjoyed a particularly long and eventful university career up to this point, but I really have no particular desire to prolong it for much longer.  So between now and the middle of April, I look forward to drinking more coffee than is good for me, sleeping when I should be awake and being awake when I should be sleeping, all the while contemplating the inherent injustices of the world in a manner that can be easily transcribed on  urlLink 3 - 4, double-spaced pages, in a 12-pt font .

       Short post this Friday.  If it's the intention of the National Hockey League to ensure a great percentage of Canadian university undergraduates perform poorly on their final exams and term projects, then I say they've been  dangerously successful . Why in their right mind would they schedule the most important part of the hockey season for April!? What makes this year's hockey season even more distracting is the way the Edmonton Oilers are vying for a playoff spot. I swear, this team will be the death of us, the way they wait until the last game of the season to potentially seal the deal, playing havoc on our stressed-out nerves at every turn.  Bah! I'm so far behind on schoolwork it's not even funny - maybe it's best that they  don't  make the playoffs. For my GPA's sake.

      You can always tell when a university student has a large load of urgent and pressing assignments to finish or exams to prepare for - their living quarters are decidedly cleaner than at any other point in time.  As I put the finishing touches on a  take-home  midterm exam and conclude studying for another midterm exam occurring in less than 12 hours, my apartment has become quite an inviting place indeed. Gone are the overflowing garbage cans and piles of dirty dishes which perfumed the air with the scents of bachelor living. Clean is the living room and kitchen and even bathroom. Hell, I went so far as to actually  scrub  the bathtub and rid it of 10 months of compounded grime!  Seeing as how the take-home midterm had to be typed, it took an enormous strength of will to actually concentrate on it and not browse laxly through websites, download music and movies, or whittle the hours away playing online games. Blogging, however, is exempt from the realm of "procrastinating" as it enables me to collect my thoughts, regain my sanity, and re-double my efforts on the task at hand...  ...the task at hand  being  to locate tonight's episode of  urlLink The Sopranos  for downloading.

      Ah, another precious long-weekend has come and gone, and if my next "holiday" is anything like this last one, I'll be in traction before I'm 25!  When Mom left me an  urgent  message on my answering machine to call her back  right away  I was actually naive enough to drop everything I was doing, as any good son should, to assuage her panicked state. Her tone was far different during my inquiring call, however, and I quickly discovered it was a clever (and successful) ploy to retain my services for a Saturday's worth of back-breaking labour back in Vegreville. Not wanting to suffer alone, I convinced Nicole to accompany me down Highway 16, to the heart of Pyrogy County, under the unassuming guise of  a little landscaping  - though she insists that she was recruited for  a little gardening .  What ensued was an afternoon so labourious and intensive that a full-scale terra-forming of the lunar surface would have paled in comparison.  It was a back-yard-cobble-stone-sidewalk-project which would have killed inferior specimens of the human species, but Nicole and I persevered, though the pain and partial paralysis of today has probably made us both wish we hadn't. Who would have thought that hours upon hours of being hunched over and rubber-mallotting interlocking bricks with  Tetris -like precision would have exacted such a toll on our young bodies!?   There were moments today when lying on the solid living room floor was  pure Heaven , and the mere thought of sitting up was enough to send spasms of pain through the length of my bruised and abused body. I want to end the life of all those HGTV renovation show programmers who've corrupted my parent's minds with deceptively evil do-it-yourself projects.  On a more positive note, I did take an overflowing basket of laundry back home with me, so as I lay immobilized on my floor, counting and cataloging the speckles on my ceiling, it will be with the clear conscience of knowing that I'm at least wearing clean underwear.

I'm then free for  16 whole days  before the next semester fires up. So, if over the course of the next few weeks I don't return your calls or show up to your birthday, or whatever, know that it's probably because it's occurring before, during, or after one of the dates listed above.

      I've been supremely mislead by the machinations of corporate advertising. I know, I know, you might be shocked to hear this as well, but the product I've seen advertised in no way lived up to my expectations.   Its new. Its hot. Its spicy. Its something different from Dairy Queen.  Its the FLAMETHROWER Burger on the Dairy Queen menu just in time for National Hamburger Month in May. The FlameThrower is made with two all-beef patties, whole leaf lettuce and sliced tomato, and topped with zesty Jalapeo bacon, spicy Pepper Jack cheese and tangy Tabasco Chipotle mayonnaise.   Though still a tasty burger,  by no means  should  Tabasco  be considered a flavouring of cataclysmic consequences. Are there really people out there who recoil at the extremeness of zesty Jalapeo bacon? And while we're at it, just what the fuck is "zesty" supposed to mean? It's kinda like "tangy," in that neither of the words means a damn thing. Do you know the difference between zesty and tangy? If I put pepper on a banana, does that make it  zesty !? They're both fabrications of the food in dustry to facilitate selling mediocre products with exciting descriptions.  However, the bottom line is that I  did not  whimper in fear at the burger,  did not  torch my surroundings with an ultra cool napalm breath, and certainly  did not  think that I  finally  found a restaurant item which lived up to the claim of being insanely hot.

      Ah, what a glorious section of the city I live in.  The Avenue of Nations , it's called, and judging by the rent I pay, you'd think it was a gated community with servants and beach-front villas down in the tropics.  But no, the only people around who accept money for giving you a hand are gangly hookers, and that's not the sound of the ocean you're hearing, but stolen grocery carts being wheeled down the back alley at 6:00am.  What really gets me, though, is the no-holds-barred mobilization of the Police in this part of town. I pulled up to my apartment to run in and use the phone before heading back out...I couldn't have been on the phone for more than a minute. When I came back outside, a car had been pulled over near the end of my alley, swarmed by  5 squad cars   and  a paddy wagon! Either I hadn't been paying attention when I first pulled in, or this massive scene of Edmonton's finest simply materialized spontaneously out of errant atoms and kinetic energy.  They had one guy in cuffs and another two lined up along a building, but a dozen officers for 3 people seems a bit much. Meanwhile, the hookers watched on in patient professionalism, eager to reclaim their turf once the boys in blue vacated.   Currently listening to: Saves The Day - My Sweet Fracture

       I probably wrote that line, or various indistinguishable permutations of it, at least a few dozen  million  times at work this evening. There's moments when this bastardized short-hand of the English language sends shivers down my spine and cools my endtrails - does the term "Newspeak" mean anything to you? How about "Ingsoc"? That's right, having finished my annual reading of George Orwell's masterpiece  Nineteen Eighty-Four , I feel like some sort of comrade deep in the heart of the  Ministry of Learning , working like mad on my own little task, kept from seeing the larger picture of just what we're collectively accomplishing.  My actual reason for posting, though, it that I wanted to proclaim loudly that  Spring in Edmonton Sucks . I worked a 7-hour shift this evening, and whereas I was able to rollerblade to work without a jacket, I almost  lost  my ears to the swirling winds and bitter, slushy cold on my way home! The weather programs may have warned me about today for the past few days, but that doesn't negate the fact that the weather choosing to turn 180 degrees on a whim is totally unacceptable.  I mean, it's 2004 already! Where's the flying cars, moon buses, and satellite controlled weather? Somewhere between 1950 and now scientists and inventors have gone horribly astray. Sure, I might be able to get an erection at 80 with a half-life of 24hrs, but what good is that if I'm not "doing" some 4-breasted space babe from another galaxy...over my lunch hour!?  Freak snow storms and lost appendages are not what  I  would have envisioned, that's for sure.  Mayor Bill Smith will be the first to orate that we Edmontonians live in the "greatest city, in the greatest province, in the greatest country in the world [and greatest galaxy in the greatest universe, I would assume - Ed.]!" but I don't see him pushing City Council to immediately fund some sort of fantastical environmental dome over this unpredictable burg. You better hope this isn't an election year, mister, because judging by the  Mother of all Ear Aches  that I've got going on, you've just lost yourself a vote.

Here's one  FWD:  that I received in my inbox that I actually appreciated, not only because it wasn't another 500lb naked woman screwing a midget, but because it brought back fond memories of  my  illegally hoarded mp3 collection.  Before the inevitable  blue screen of doom  locked up my computer, I was in the midst of adding to my 4000+ mp3 collection with utter crapulence. No album was out of my reach, and my propensity to download  every  single song for an artist and meticulously arrange them all into albums, with the appropriate album cover artwork on the folder, and label them in a uniform manner, bordered on a form of mental disorder I'd rather not know about. But alas, one Windows XP re-install later, and my 192kbps digitally compressed treasure trove of ill gotten goods was gone...  ...even my pirated screener of  The Passion of the Christ ! The look on Nicole's face was somewhere between shock, disgust, and holy fear when she exclaimed, "You stole a movie about Jesus!?" I had no witty reply at the time, but weeks of late-night contemplation assured me that movies about Jesus should be open and free to all. Besides, it's not polite to argue about things like religion or politics. Silver City and their $15 tickets aren't going to come between me and  my  faith!  Yeah, you heard me!

I managed to get a solid 4 hours of sleep last night, make it to my 08:00 Anthropology final exam, which was 3 hours long, and rush home as quickly as possible to put the finishing touches on my take-home exam, which has to be handed in at 18:00 at the University. That gives me 5 hours to perfect my masterpiece, ensuring that I maintain my 4.0 GPA in that class.  Within moments, nay,  seconds  of sitting down at my computer, the  car alarm  on my  asshole  neighbor's car begins to go off! What makes this even worse, is that his car is parked directly beside my windows, a mere few feet away.  It's Murphy's Law - the moment I have something vitally important to do, all hell breaks loose.  It's that annoying alarm too, that changes tones every few seconds.  I guess the only solace I can take is that this asshole doesn't appear to be home, and his car battery will be long dead by the time I head back to the University. If it's not, then I'll personally heave a few bricks through his windshield.   Currently listening to: You guessed it...that damn car alarm!

      So, here I am again - final exam season. With the compacted schedule of Spring/Summer session, this season is a mere 2 days, but it's no less stressful and demanding.  I've got a take-home final exam due Friday evening at 18:00, and an in-class final Friday morning at 08:00. The sheer amount of time compartmentalization I'll be pulling off over the next 48 hours will be astounding:  Wednesday 21:00 to 21:05 - receive take-home final exam 22:00 to ??:?? - start working on take-home final  Thursday ??:?? to ??:?? - sleep for a few hours ??:?? to 14:00 - study for in-class final 15:00 to 22:00 - work 23:00 to ??:?? - sleep for a few hours  Friday ??:?? to 07:00 - study for in-class final 08:00 to 10:00 - write in-class final 11:00 to 14:00 - finish/touch up take home final 15:00 to 22:00 - work  Things get a bit more ugly if I try to juggle my work schedule. If I cancel my Thursday shift to study, then I need to work my Friday shift, meaning I won't have Friday afternoon to touch up my take-home final, and I'll have to hand it in almost 5 hours before the 18:00 due time. If I work on Thursday it gives me less time to study for my in-class final but more time on Friday to work on my take-home final...  ...bah! This is  hurting my brain  already! I shouldn't be wasting my precious time doing this blog anyways! I'd better get cracking!

      Seriously, I think the University of Alberta is trying to  kill  me. I arrived this afternoon for my Physical Anthropology lab, which was located on the main floor of the Henry Marshall Tory Building. As I rounded the corner of the final hall, I was greeted by a half dozen people sporting bio-hazard safety suits, respirators and all.  "What the fu...!?"  Right  next  to the door to my lab, they had a sealed plastic working area, and hoses running up into the ceiling. Apparently, they were there to remove  asbestos  from the building. I dunno, maybe it's just me, but for all the money I pay in tuition, is it too much to ask that the classrooms I'm learning in won't case me bodily harm? Is that  really  such an unreasonable request?   Currently: Putting the final touches on my term paper extraordinaire!

      Despite knowing that this crap will ultimately shorten my life-span, despite the revealed horrors of fast food in films like  urlLink Supersize Me  and books like  urlLink Fast Food Nation , I cannot, and  will not  give up Toonie Twosday at  urlLink Kentucky Fried Chicken . For $2.22 you get to indulge in 2 pieces of the Colonel's finest artery clogging fowl and small fry. Amazing! You can hardly buy  raw  chicken that cheaply at the grocery store, even before people cowered in fear from the Avian Flu.  So, as I sit here, finishing up  two  meals, I am one contented person. Thank God this special only happens once a week, because it takes about that long before you can even think about doing it again. Blech...   Currently gorging myself on horribly delicious "food."

      Okay, the time has come at last! Here's the details on my moving plans.    Friday, July 30   I'll  only  have the U-Haul from 07:30 to 16:00, and once everything is cleared out of Nicole's and then my apartment, It'll all need to  unloaded again  into a self-storage locker.    Saturday, July 31   If I am unable to borrow the services of someone with a pick-up truck, I'll need to rent one in order to haul the larger items out of the storage locker and into the apartment. I have the elevators booked from 11:00 to 15:00. Since we have the storage locker for an entire month, smaller boxes and items that fit in my car can gradually be moved it.   So guys, if you can help out at all, even for a few hours, please don't hesitate to give me a call and let me know. For the most part it will only be my dad and I doing the moving, and he's got a pretty bad back - I'd hate to put him out of commission for a few days.   My phone should remain hooked-up during this time, so I hope to hear from you!    Currently: Finishing up last minute packing and cleaning.

      Hey, hey! It's getting to be that time of the year again -  moving day !   That's right, folks. I would  greatly  appreciate a few helping hands on July 30, July 31, or both! I'll be renting a 17' U-Haul for the Friday, and I hope to pack up most of Nicole's apartment, and then mine, freeing up the Saturday morning for last-minute cleaning. I'll be able to start moving into the new apartment after 12:00pm.   For those of you who drink beer, well, I'll provide the beer! For those of you who prefer alternative refreshments, I'll help you out there as well. Depending upon how many of you show up, there might even be a nice meal somewhere in the deal.   So if you can help out at all during those days, even though it would nullify your long-weekend, I would be extremely grateful.    Currently: Enjoying some Chinese food leftovers

      Hot enough for you? Hooo-weee!&nbsp;This humid weather is almost getting to be  too much , you know, with the abundance of  swass  (or "sweaty ass") plaguing the City of Champions.  &nbsp;  I updated my reading list in the right column. I've polished off  LOTR: The Two Towers  while manning the phones at work, and with  LOTR: The Return of the King , I'll be completing the trilogy for the 3rd time. I'm still slogging my way through  Les Miserables , and I've decided to give  War and Peace  a 9th chance...here's hoping I at least get beyond the preface  this  time!  &nbsp;  On Sunday Nicole and I headed down to Camrose, which I discovered is referred to as "The Rose City," though I didn't recognize "rose" was half of the city name until that point. Shades of the IHOP -> International House of Pancakes scenario with George in Vancouver. Anyways, their new-old house has a backyard to  die  for, and a hottub to  kill  for.  &nbsp;  Which makes it almost as dangerous as our lovely new apartment!  &nbsp;   Currently: Cramming in the final gooey nuggets of Religious Anthropology before the midterm.

      I was flipping through the latest issue of Maclean's, when I came across an interesting set of numbers:   461,068 hot dogs  96,272 corn dogs  1.8 million mini donuts  76,652 hamburgers  3,475 litres of ketchup  12,864 cobs of corn  26,000 steaks (10oz.)  45,549 kg of potatoes  21,000 tubs of popcorn  49,342 clouds of cotton candy  29,563 slices of pizza  154,912 bottles of water  93,636 kg of ice cubes  50,271 candy apples  These are the numbers for the Calgary Stampede, indicating the unbelievable amount of carnie-food that will be consumed over the course of 10 days. Quite frankly, I think these numbers are a bit low, as Nicole, George, and myself  alone  consumed nearly half this amount in 2 days! Between the ice cream, mini donuts, funnel cake, candy apples, debi manjoos, corn dogs, pop, water, beer, and lunch buffet, it was a truly disturbing sight.  My only regret is that I never made good on my promise to have the deep-fried Snickers on a stick! That funnel cake that George got was more than enough to lubricate my innards and negatively impact my health...   Currently listening to: Fuel - Innocent

      In 3 weeks I'll be changing my place of residence, forsaking the untamed wilderness of 107th's "Avenue of Nations" and inching ever so closer to the River Valley. Nicole and I have managed to stumble upon an attractive suite in Renaissance Place.  Yes, ... urlLink that  Renaissance Place.  I used to think it was quaint that we were moving into a building where a man I knew of, Gary Prime, was brutally murdered in his own suite by  hatchet wielding maniacs . When we first checked out the building, I even joked that, "If we're shown a suite at the end of the hall, we're  not  taking it!"  But now, with yet another brutal murder in the same upscale building in the past 3 years, we're living in one of the deadliest buildings in Edmonton - which makes our new place  even better ! I can picture great Hallowe'en parties already...   Currently: Packing a few items for our weekend getaway.

      This post is especially for you...so there's no need to keep trying to call me at home, since my spare time these days is measured in minutes and not hours.  I'm not going to forget about you, buddy.  It looks like we'll be leaving Saturday morning/early-afternoonish. Probably around 10am or so. If you'd like a ride into Calgary, just be sure to be in the city before then. You could hitch a ride in on Friday night, or really early on Saturday.  We will, however, be coming back to Edmonton late Sunday evening, so if you want to catch Finger Eleven on Monday night, you'll probably need to catch a Greyhound home.  If you need a place to stay Friday or Sunday, I've got a love seat with your name on it!   Currently: Using the horrible DELL computers in the flooding Rutherford Library

      ... Red  Fish,  Blue  Fish. Except, well, that the first one was blue, and the second one is red.  Blinky 2.0, as I've affectionately named the second Betta I've owned in an eventual unbroken line of fighting fish stretching beyond time and space, is actually quite amazing. His predecessor lasted a mere 10 days, yet he's continued on for a solid 6 months, if not longer!  He does all these amazing tricks, like  floating upside down  and  being buried under rocks  and even swimming  on his side !  I was  very  surprised to see him alive after I left town for nearly 10 days, but he seems more alive now than ever before! Whenever I seem to think he's dead, and prepare to give 'em the ol' flush funeral, he jolts back to life with a renewed vigor that buys him another week. You've got to admire that stubborn desire to live. This fish has more lives than George W. Bush has brain cells, and was a hell of a bargain at $3.49!

      It's the second day of classes and already things have started at a brisk pace. After the first day alone, I had close to 100 pages of reading to do! My schedule is set up rather nicely, though, with a 2+ hour gap between my two classes - just long enough to give me time to study or hit the gym, and just short enough to keep me from leaving the University.  Though not wallowing in my own financial crapulence by  any  means, my 8-day stint with Tri-City has afforded me a bit of dreaming room. Canadian Tire has a particular set of  urlLink goaltender pads  which has piqued my interest. Coupled with a new blocker/catcher set, these elegant  34"  pads will certainly cover a few more holes in the net. My first priority at the moment, however, is covering the moving expenses for the new apartment Nicole and I will be moving in to, especially a new barbecue for our gigantic River Valley-viewing patio! The new goalie equipment, however, is certainly a close second.  This upcoming weekend we plan to drive on down to Cowtown to enjoy the Stampede, which is infinitely better than Klondike Days, though we won't be leaving until Saturday morning. In the meantime, we're looking for a place to stay...sooooo,  George  does your Uncle mind a few transients in his place over the weekend? If not, Nicole has a cousin we might be able to stay with, but your  diseased  company would be much more fun.  And yes, Scott, if you pitch in a few dollars for gas, we could probably bring you along, but you'll be missing Finger Eleven is they're playing on Friday.

      It's July 2 already, eh? Where in the world does time fly.  Seeing as how I finished Spring Session at the University of Alberta, and mighty successfully too!, you'd think that I'd enjoy the 16 days I had off until Summer Session started up.   Pfffttt...!   Though it was only for 8 days, I've been out by Lloydminster working for  Tri-City Drilling  to stockpile a little extra cash. It was 8 shifts of graveyard work, from 19:30-07:30, so my internal clock is entirely out of whack.  Sleep, need sleep soooo badly.   Currently: Amazed that Blinky 2.0 is still alive after not being fed all this time!

      One final exam to go, and I'm done with University for an  entire 3 weeks , before heading back in September for the final, long-anticipated, and infamous final stretch of my University undergraduate career.  Upon returning home from work this afternoon, I'll be diving head-first into an Anthropology of Religion take-home final exam/paper, which is worth an impressive 40% of my final grade in the course. My experience with Sociology and Anthropology is that Anthropology has turned out to be what I thought Sociology was about, and Sociology has turned out to be something resembling  quantum mathematics  and  infinintesimal algebraic theory . While enjoying both, it tends to be with Anthropology that my literary skills of bull-shitism and wild, unfounded, and imaginative declarations vexes the instructors into assigning me a high grade.  Having said that, though, I had a uniquely unexpected experience before writing a final exam this morning. As the professor was handing out the exam, he brought up the grades for our term project (the one I handed in on Monday after staying awake for over 30 hours) and was polite enough to announce that I had received the highest grade  and  received a  monetary  award for my proficiency! Never before have I received money from a professor for a job well done; bribes tend to flow from student to teacher, as I understand it. It was also unsettling, because it took a good 10 minutes before my elation cleared and I was able to actually focus on writing the exam at hand.  So, as I type this in the confines of Nicole and I's new, unsettled apartment, I'm enjoying a cold beer on the patio and pat on the back for continuing the reversal of a post-secondary education that was formerly beyond abysmal.
