      The mist engulfed the girl, swallowed her up in a sea of colorless clouds. She turned around to see where her friends had gone, but the clouds over the land were so thick that she couldn't even see the careful footprints she had left in the sand. It was getting late, the sun was getting ready to retire for the day, and darkness was swallowing up the sun's last glimmers of life. The shimmering droplets of dew kissed her neck as the whispering breeze coaxed her soft brown locks of curly hair to dance and twirl behind her head.        Her sundress swayed all around her as the wind played with the fabric. Many thoughts wandered through her mind as she aimlessly walked along the desolate beach. She wondered what ever became of her companions who had accompanied her to this solitude place. They must have left without her, she thought. Deserted by the people who supposedly loved her. Left behind to become one with the fog, to forever blend in with the night only to become a shadow, a quick silhouette out of the corner of one's eye. But she didn't mind, she was not afraid of the night and it's creatures. She felt as if she was a part of them, they always watched her and protected her from any evil, so she was never alone.     Far away in the distance, she heard the familiar calling of a sea gull. It was summoning her. Within a few minutes it had swooped down and settled on her shoulder. It sat perched, attentive constantly watching out for any danger that might intersect her path.     Beyond the beach there was a secluded forest. She stared straight before her, entranced in the mystic feeling of the forest upon her. The sea gull cried as she reached the entrance to the forest; warning her not to enter. It flew off of her shoulder, went a few feet in front of her, then came back and sat on her shoulder once more.     The fog was even more condensed in the forest, causing a haze around the canopies of the trees, swirling down to the ground making it impossible to see where she was going. The girl walked swiftly downhill weaving her way through the trees, when her feet no longer met the ground. A scream pierced the deadly silence as she fell for an Eternity.     A looming cloud of blackness swept over her. A blanket of red slowly crept over her eyes and face, putting her to sleep. The bird quietly hovered beside her broken body.     When the girl woke up she had no idea how much time had elapsed. She tried to sit up, but the pain in her head would not allow her to. Lying on the floor of the ravine, she was not far from a little inlet of water formed by the ocean.     She crawled over to the crystal clear water, and took a long and relieving drink. As she sipped the cool water she took a good look at her reflection.     She muffled a cry as she watched the face in the pond stare back at her. This person in the pond was not her; something about her had changed. She reached out and felt the smoothness of the still water. The ripples created by her finger contorted her face. She reached her hand out of the water, and brought it up to her forehead. She felt a gaping hole in her skull that must be at least an inch and a half wide, and from the feel of it very deep. As she prodded around her injury, she felt no pain, only numbness.     She made an effort once more to try to stand up. Very slowly she got up to her knees then elbowed the rest of her way up. She stood and looked all around her. It was a very cloudy day. The sea gull spread it's enormous white wings from the rock it was sitting on, then flew away in the distance. It cried very mournfully in the early morning, as it flew out of the forest and back towards the beach.     She watched the bird leave then staggered over to the nearest tree for support. The water in the pond and the grass around her seemed unusually bright. The low hanging clouds in the sky seemed very ominous to her, the birds chirping in the distance seemed oddly loud, and the trees and it's leaves seemed unusually lively and vivid to her.     Her attention was brought back to reality when she heard voices in the background. They were getting louder and louder inside of her head. She could almost make out what one of them was saying. They were heading over to the pond where she was. Pretty soon she could identify two of the voices to be female, one male. They all sounded familiar, but the guy's voice struck a cord of her memory.     She put her hand to her head, for she was beginning to get a headache. She tried and tried to place his voice, but couldn't think because the sounds of all the other people in her head were crowding out her thoughts.     One of the girls started screaming hysterically. Pain exploded in her head. The girl was talking so fast that no one could understand her, so she waved frantically at the center of the pond. Pretty soon everyone was shouting, and crying. The sea gull was back now, and was hovering over the three people at the other side of the pond, it's voice howled in agony. All the noise inside of her head drowned together into one high-pitched whine. She desperately tried covering her ears to make it go away, but it was useless. She looked back over at the group of hysterical people. The guy had wadded into the water and was desperately trying to pull something out of the water. He screamed for the other two girls to help him; something about it being too heavy.     The pain in her head had intensified so much that she was having trouble seeing. She blinked and suddenly the pond was pure red. She blinked over and over again to make the awful image go away...     "Oh my God!! It's Jennifer!" The guy blurted out.     At the sound of her name, the girl looked up and saw a body that resembled hers, as she looked down at herself, then to the individual being drug out of the water.     Instantly she was floating above the three people and staring straight into her face; when the lifeless reflection twisted into a grin.     Jennifer bolted straight up in her bed. She heard a blood curdling scream echoing in her room, then realized it was the sound of her own voice.

      Listening to the pitter-patter of the rain on the hood of the car, Christy weaved her way along the slippery, winding mountain road.  She watched the raindrops glisten as the headlights shone through them.  As she rounded a corner, she was blinded by the oncoming car's lights.  She flipped her headlights to the other car so they would turn off their brights, but they didn't respond to her signal.  The car breezed by her, spraying water onto her windshield.  She was still seeing spots in her eyes.  She tried blinking to make the blotches in her vision go away.     For that brief second that she had her eyes closed, Christy did not see the speeding car in the other lane that swerved to miss hitting her as she came out of another curve, broke through the guard rail, and sailed into the night.  Startled by the dreadful sound of the metal ripping and bending, Christy slammed on her brakes.  She hydroplaned about five hundred extra feet before coming to a halting stop, nearly missing a tree.  As she put the car into park, she heard a thunderous crash as the other car hit the bottom of the ravine.     Christy shut off her engine, and ran over to the edge of the cliff.  There was a full moon, and it cast some of its morbid light on the twisted mass of sheet metal at the bottom of the gorge.  From the looks of that mess, she didn't see how anyone could actually be alive down there.  But just in case...     She ran over to her car, started it up and sped away into the dead of night in search of a phone.     Something stirred in the mass of tangled metal.  The raindrops beat down endlessly on the car.  A scream of pain cursed the night, begging for help.  The rain stung the young man’s wounds as he tried to crawl out of what was left of his car.  The roof was ripped open, so he tried to hoist himself up and out.  The windshield was shattered all over the buckled up front hood, and he sliced his back as he rolled down the hood and onto a rock. He screamed in agony.  He fell to the ground in immense amounts of pain.  He laid there for a couple of seconds, then realized that Esther was still in the car. "Oh, my god!" he blurted out.  But there was nothing he could do for her, he couldn't save her, he couldn't even move!!  What was he going to do?  He tried to sit up, trying to ignore the pain.  He looked over at the car; Esther was not moving inside. She was slouched up against the dashboard, with her head sticking out of where the windshield used to be.  Her whole face and hair was soaked with blood, and it was dripping all over the car, making it look as if the car itself was bleeding too.     Sitting there, not far from his car and girlfriend,     John began to cry.  This can't be happening.  Looking at Esther, the realization sunk in that there was no way she could still be alive.  Blood was everywhere, and she was completely motionless; not even a muscle twitched in her.     John began to cry harder and harder the more he thought of Esther.  How much he was going to miss her, how much he loved her, and what he was going to do without her.  He wished he was dead too.     "Damn it!  Why did I have to survive?  Why?!  Why didn't I die too?"  John buried his hands in his face and emptied his soul.  Far away he could hear the mournful wail of the ambulance approaching him.  Time seemed to slow down, everything seemed to be stuck in slow motion, almost like the devil was watching the movie of his shattered life, and decided to mock him by watching it in slow motion.     John had one last thought that shredded his heart into a million pieces; "I just killed my precious Esther, I'm a murderer."  With that last thought floating in his head, John gave into the looming blackness that swallowed him up.     Christy parked her car in the same spot she had been at earlier, with the ambulance parking behind her.  She led the rescue crew through the ripped guardrail, and down the steep hill to the bottom.  They had to crawl backwards very slowly to get down, because the slope was so abrupt.  It took them ten minutes to reach the car.  One of the crewmen ran over to John, who was lying face down against a rock. The other two crewmen ran over to Esther who was slumped against the front of the car.  Christy took a good look around her and almost got sick.  She knew for as long as she would live, she would never forget this scene.  It will be etched in her memory for the rest of her natural life.  She started walking away from the scene; she wanted to separate herself from the horrors that were taking place.  One of the ambulance guys was radioing up to the driver telling him that they needed a body bag, and to send for a helicopter to get the young man out of here.  There was no way that they could get a stretcher down here.  But at least he was still alive.     Not far from the accident was a little patch of forest.  She reached the entrance to the woods in a couple of minutes; there was a log about ten feet in front of her.  She walked over to it and sat down.     Then the dam broke free, and Christy McClain cried for the people back there.  This was so unfair.  She looked up at the sky, she could see all the stars crystal clear from here, and the moon was full and bright.  On this beautiful night someone lost their life.  She hoped that her last memory of this world was a pleasant one.  For tonight, the devil reached down and snatched someone's soul out of their body.     Christy moved from the log to the ground and leaned up against it.  She hadn't noticed until now, but the rain had stopped. She wondered when it had quit.     She pulled her legs up closer to her chest, and buried her head against her knees, allowing her chestnut color hair to spill all over.  The wind picked her hair up and whipped it all around her.  She closed her eyes and listened to the sounds surrounding her.  Pretty soon she could hear the helicopter hovering above, looking for a place to land.  She heard voices shouting.  Then she felt someone tap her on her shoulder.     "Ahh!"     "I'm sorry Miss McClain, I didn't mean to scare you.  Are you coming with the helicopter to the hospital?"  The crewman held his hand out for her to take.  She took it and he helped her up.  She wiped her hair away from her face.  He put his arm around her and walked her back to the site.  They climbed into the helicopter, and it took off.  Sitting on her right was a stretcher with the young man lying motionlessly within.     "Is he d-dead?"  Christy asked.  One of the crewmen nodded no.  He was busy attaching an oxygen mask.  His hands lay folded together in front of him.  There were bloodstains all over his shirt, and face, yet he still looked beautiful.  There was something that seemed to radiate from him; she wasn't sure what it was, maybe it was Life itself.  She hoped he didn't give up.     Christy took his left hand and held it the entire ride to the nearest hospital.  She heard the pilot radio in their arrival, and the condition the young man was in.     When they landed they were greeted by several doctors and nurses.  They took the stretcher that the young man was on, and raced him down to x-ray.  Then some people went to the back of the plane, carried out the girl and took her downstairs to the morgue.     Christy went to the x-ray waiting room.  A police officer was waiting for her, to question her about the accident, and what she saw.  She was not in the mood for this.  Her head was pounding with a thunderous intensity.  She could not shake the image of the girl slumped against the dashboard with blood dripping everywhere, and the guy lying face down against the rock. Tears quietly escaped down her face, as the police officer approached her.     "Are you Christy McClain?"     She nodded, and stood up to greet him.     "I'm Officer Mike Taylor.  I'm terribly sorry about what happened tonight.  Did you know either one of them?"   She shook her head.     "Can you please tell me what happened at about 11:13 p.m? I would like to get the accident report and the coroners report filled out."     At the sound of the words coroners report, Christy’s eyes swelled up even more.  She sat down at the nearest chair.  She put her hands up to her head, and buried her face.  Between sobs she managed to choke out how the car before the couple's had their brights on and blinded her for a minute, and she was coming out of a curve when they had swerved out of her lane to miss hitting her, when they broke through the guard rail.     "And the roads were very slippery, right?"     She nodded.     "How fast were you going?"     "I-I'm not sure."     "The speedometer of the wrecked car was stuck at forty-one miles per hour.  Which is six miles over the posted limit for those curves. Now please try to remember how fast you were going."     Officer Taylor looked directly down at Christy.  She looked up at him for a minute, but did not make eye contact, then looked away into space when she spoke next...     She started crying even harder,  "I'm so sorry-  Oh my God, I didn't mean to kill her!  I didn't mean to hurt anyone!  I- my eyes, they were full of spots- I couldn't see.  I came out of the turn to late, they swerved to miss hitting me, then they slid through the gua-guard rail.  It was raining so hard..."  Christy was sobbing uncontrollably.  She slumped down in her seat.     Officer Taylor took her hand and helped her up.  "Come on, you're coming with me."     He helped her out of the hospital, and into the police car with the sounds of her mourning echoing in the early morning.
