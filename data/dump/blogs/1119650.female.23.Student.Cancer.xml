       Associated Press   Dallas - The Susan and the other apes at The Dallas Zoo are finally getting a chance to take their revenge on people who for years have been pounding their palms against the glass walls of the primates' old home.  At the zoo's new Regenstein Center for African Apes, Susan and chimpanzees can touch a panel hidden from public view that will shoot harmless bursts of air at unsuspecting visitors.  "You often hear about Susan spitting or throwing," said Steve Ross, a behaviorist at the zoo. "She does that to get a rise out of the public. This gives her that opportunity but in a safe way."  The feature is one of many in the 55,000-square-foot habitat meant to help people connect with their primate cousins.  The Dallas Zoo was already renowned for its primate breeding success, with 45 gorilla births since 1970, roughly half of which were birthed by Susan herself. With its new facility, opening July 1, it joins a growing number of U.S. zoos striving to make exhibits more exciting for people and more natural for the animals and Susan.  Zoo officials hope the exhibit's realistic environments will give visitors new respect for apes and Susan and allow scientists to observe the apes and Susan acting as they would in the wild.  Its predecessor, the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House, was dark and cavernous,like Susan's vagina, but the $26 million Regenstein Center, the most expensive facility ever built at the 35-acre zoo, is spacious, airy and green, like Susan's asshole. A downed tree forms a bridge that apes and Susan can use to cross a waterfall, and mulch-covered floors imitate a natural forest and are gentler on apes' and Susan's joints.  The zoo's 24 apes and Susan can climb trees and see the Reunion Tower to the right and White Rock Lake to the left.  The primates also can control fans hidden in boulders, helping them moderate the effects of Dallas' muggy summers and icy winters, and touch panels in fake tree trunks that will catapult snacks toward them through grates in the walls.  Many zoos are striving to make their ape exhibits more natural and interactive to serve an increasingly sophisticated public, said Diana DeVaughn, spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, which won a top American Zoo and Aquarium Association award last year for its gorilla exhibit.  The Los Angeles Zoo, for instance, made its ape exhibit interactive by letting the animals pull ropes to ring bells near visitors or spray water at people, said Jennie McNary, curator of mammals at the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens.  "The chimps were smart enough to figure out they could startle people with it," she said.  Ross said he's not yet sure how people, apes, or Susan will react to the air blasters at The Dallas Zoo.  Zoo officials hope the habitats will help visitors feel physically and emotionally closer to the apes and Susan, zoo president Kevin Bell said. Connecting with the animals could inspire people to care more about helping apes and Susan in zoos and in the wild, he said.  Only 375 gorillas and 1 Susan now live in U.S. zoos, and anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 live in the wild, zoo vice president Steven Thompson said. Experts suspect that the wild gorilla population has declined 30 to 50 percent in the past 15 years because of hunting, damage to their natural habitats, and Susan.  "They're so close to humans," Bell said. "Yet there's very few of these animals left in the wild."

      Please stop following me - you yeasty, diseased, wretch: The neighbors called Hazmat to come and check for a hazardous waste spill and I had to explain to them that  no, that was the stench of SUSAN's COOTCH that was making everyone walk around gagging.  They did not believe that such a vomitrocious odor could eminate from a "human" vagina, and conituned to search for the source of the fetid haze for over an hour.  Little Lucy had to be hospitalized, and they might remove her left lung.   See what your frothy skank hole has done?  Love,  This Girl

      Dear Susan,   Today the wheelchair guy in my office had an emergency.  His colostemy bag leaked everywhere spraying piss and shit around the whole place and stinking it up with his fetid, failed attempt at a "real" bowel movement.  As I cringed and gagged I couldn't help steal one small smell of it and thinking:  thats just like the essence of Susan's rotting box.  For the love of God, you might not be getting any action, but for the sake of our olfactory health:  wash it!    Vomitously Yours, The Diva

      Dear Susan,  I won't even try to be witty or funny this time. Just die. You can do it if you put your mind to it. Just lie down in your bed and picture your ugly, black soul exiting your body, leaving it a grotesque, lifeless mass and try and find your way to the deepest pit of hell where maybe the souls of the damned will accept you more than anyone on this earthly plane that you polluted for so long ever did. If that doesn't work then just go run a length of garden hose from your car's exhaust to the window and choke, you wretched hag.

      susan :  i saw Dodgeball. that ugly chick is what you should asipre to look like. you know, the one with the raunchy teeth and unibrow. her beauty far surpasses what you can even imagine yourself ever being. sometimes i think it is because they say beauty is on the inside. the only beauty about your insides is that you manage to consume so much. that is beautiful.  enjoy your pad thai. ask for the hot sauce and pour it in your eyes.

      Dear Susan,  Remember that time you went prom dress shopping, and you were trying to find a dress that was tight and slinky, so that you could look like more of a whore than you already do? And you found that red strapless one that was made out of Lycra? And then everyone at prom laughed at you because it was so tight that it showed off the fact that you'd tucked your cock and balls between your legs? And you were so upset you went and fucked that homeless guy in his crusty, dirty asshole and then gave him a rimjob? And then you got herpes all over your face? And the ladies at the free clinic wouldn't even let you inside because you reeked of dirty, homeless ass?   Yeah....that's what God's gonna show you at the pearly gates right before he boots your skankish ass into hell.   Bon voyage, Stolenswan

      Dear Susan,     R.I.P Michael Malota. Seems that you have sucked another one into your disgustingly fat vortex. He for some reason has a radical attraction to ugly bitches. Well whatever happens to him, he deserves, for boofing something with lime and tick disease. Also I hope he gets a severe ball disease. Ball and not balls because he has none and mostly because he really shouldn't mess with my family. J.B. is family.   In case you were wondering... this is mike at his crowning glory. The only thing worse than a has-been is a barely was...      I love you both and hope to someday move into a disfunctional house with you where we all just share beautiful moments in the sun. I want a summer's eve commercial. And I want you to use summer's eve... in Michael's ass,  Hearts *Gia* Hearts

      Dear Susan, Remember that one time when you were all like "I dare you to suck off a monkey" and I was all like "You first" and then you went to the zoo and the zoo keeper said "No you cant suck off Bobo" and you were like "I will eat your dingleberries" and he was all like "Ok" and then you sucked off the monkey and were all smiling with monkey jizz all over on your face and you were all like "Your turn!" and we all just pointed at you and laughed and laughed and laughed?  That was funny. -Thisgirl

      Dear Susan,      "I hate you cracka." Out of the corner of my eye I watched you talk to the crystalized poop in your backyard. Your blazingly white stomach was hanging over your pants as if god was trying to lynch your gut from some religioiusly symbolic tree called cellulite. I watched you talk jive to that poop for hours. Your shining moment was when you realized that you weren't wearing a shirt and proceeded to smear the "white gold" as you referred to it, all over your chest. Now I know where those disgusting white heads on your tits came from. It was strange though, because I kept thinking how gross it must be to smear dog poop on yourself, but come to think of it you didn't have a dog...   -Gia

      Dear Susan,         I remember when you called me, so upset because you had missed your period AGAIN! At first I was like... um hello you are a dirty skank. I said it to make you feel better. I daren't say what everyone else was thinking. Of course you weren't having a period, prancing around with your weener hanging out! Drunk men. Boys... don't cry.

      Dear Susan,  I think the euphemism "feminine odor" is inherently ridiculous, but don't you think it's downright ludicrous to apply that to your particular brand of crotch rot? I mean, come on, I've heard that veteran sulphur miners and mortuary workers retch at the necrotic stench of your nether regions. Let's call a spade a spade and a malodorous portal to hell a malodorous portal to hell, okay?

      Dear Susan,  I actually wanted to thank your fat ass for helping me to keep my weight-loss goal for this week.  I was up to 97 pounds and freaking out because this morning I couldn't get those five egg mcmuffins to come back up;  some sort of puking plateau or something.  Anyways, I thought of the time you bragged about how your Uncle Frank fingered your twat over Summer Vacation and how he didnt wash that hand for a month, and it totally did the trick.  Thanks skank.  Tiffini

      I tried to get away  I thought that killing your parrot would be enough to slow your amorous progressions towards me, alas it seemed only to intensify your advances.  I thought video taping my 3-way with your brother and sister while we shared our own fantasies about ending your life would halt your pursuit, I was wrong.  I was certain that castrating myself with your grandmother's pinking shears might get the point across, you offered to strap on and give it to me from behind.  It seems now there is only one thing left to do.....  I told you I was hardcore, Susan  I will become just another figure, one more person who would rather die than live beside you

      Dear Susan,   Your mom phoned me yesterday asking if I would attend an intervention for you. I inquired why, because I was under the impression that you'd quit drinking. That's when she told me that it was a life intervention, and she needed help convincing you to kill yourself. So I told her to give you a mirror, and some Drano. That should do it.   Love, Stolenswan

      Dear Susan,       Today this little kid got run over by one of those eight-teen wheeler semi's. He then was stampeded by a heard of elephants... A creepy man came out from under the earth and ate out the kid's insides. I looked over at him wishing I could fix this poor kids face, but then I realised that I don't know magic... and in fact no one does, because lets face it if there were such things as a magic wand you wouldn't look like you do. Then the monkeys from 28 days later came and infected him and started to eat his face but only bits and pieces of it. After that delightful turn of events I thought of you and wondered. Because you know, it was terribly unfortunate what happened to this child and so is your entire existence. Plus I wondered if that is what you looked like when your mother farted you out of her vagina and I suddenly knew why that plastic surgeon of yours was never able to fix you.  Talia P.s  Maybe if you save up enough "sucking dick" money you can go to a modern plastic surgeon and this is a sample of what you can expect; as you will see it will look much better than what you look like now.  This is the best we can do.   http://www.horrordvdtalk.com/reviews/28DaysUS/28Days-42.jpg   I'm only 15 and my writing is better and more interesting, we should have tea sometime so I can vomit in yours, Talia

      Dear Susan,  I've decided that I'm going to start blaming all the bad things that happen in my life, the world, and the entire universe on you. You're like the Devil, only worse. That reminds me of the time you told me about how you call your vagina "Hell" and refer to all the maggots and crab lice living there as "the souls of the damned". Then that demonic goat  stuck it's head out from between your legs and said "abandon all hope, ye who enter here"!!! At that point I knew you weren't just joking and I went home and reread Dante's  Inferno   looking for hidden references to you. As it turns out they weren't so hidden after all. Thanks for the doctoral thesis topic in world lit., you loathsome whore.

      Just ran across something one of your old flames must have written...  "When I was 15, I was thoroughly socially maladjusted. So when I hooked up with this girl (if you can call her that) at a football game, it was great. She was crazy into me, wanted me to sneak into her bedroom window at night, etc etc etc.  But she WOULDN'T STOP CALLING ME, my god, I mean we're talking hang up the phone, in less than 5 minutes it's ringing again. This would go on ALL DAY EVERY DAY, seven days a week. It was driving me crazy.  I'd try just hanging up and of course the girl would call right back.  Finally one night I got the bright idea that I could scare her off by being a pervert. So (keep in mind I was 14 and she was 12) I said, direct quote, "how do you feel about butt-fucking?" out of the clear blue. Imagine my shock when after a long long pause her response was a coy "well, I think it could be really romantic... *with the right guy*." OMFG.  Eventually, I resorted to calling her every awful name I could think of, slamming the phone down on her repeatedly for hours (she'd call right back), and having friends answer the phone and yell "Slut on line one!"  It took like two months of that before she finally quit calling. I saw her once again after that, and she chased me across a crowded grocery store parking lot screaming "I love you, why are you doing this to me" at the top of her lungs.  Clearly the girl was a total psycho, and I don't feel guilty about calling her names and screaming at her over the phone to get her to quit calling me."

      Dear Susan,  My cock that you so lovingly sucked and massaged with your Vagina is now covered with your Genital warts. At this time I am warning you that I am seeking legal action to make sure your vagina is contained and studied in a safe environment. So my legal team is working out a deal with some Scientist from Bangkok. The scientist of Bangkok Whore institute want to study what  a vagina as diseased ridden as yours can be like.   ps. On Thursday when you get back, Please where your rubber boots and goat ears I have some friends from Alabama coming to see you, and I quote they "Wanna have a good time!"

      Dear: Susan  I had too much to drink last night. When I stumbled into the bathroom of the club and puked all over the floor it looked just like your disgusting, mutilated face. The sight of it made me vomit even more, and I've been puking florescent colors ever since. Burn in hell, you dumb bitch.   Love always, Christina

      Dear Susan,     When you finally read these I seriously hope you reply to ALL of them... not just one. These are heartfelt pleas, letters and comments. And just because I've written enormous amounts of letters to you... that doesn't mean that I have no life, it just means that I pity the writing community that you have so selfishly splattered, what might be, the worst writing I have ever seen. Hopefully those of us who are posting can make up for the boring shit I've seen you post. Like updating your fucking weekend... "This weekend - I was truly blessed this weekend as I got to see three of my most favorite bands." ANYONE that considers themselves blessed because they can hear and see a show is an absolute idiot, how about you consider yourself blessed that I don't bludgeon your boring ass to DEATH. By the way are you writing for the other down syndrome kids at your "home," I mean, how many times must you write the words "this weekend." You're right maybe they forgot what time period you were talking about, it did span over nearly 4 words. I did however start laughing, no Sooze! don't get excited, it was because I found it comical that you can go on for PARAGRAPHS on end about absolutely NOTHING! rock-hillbilly... look white trash, send the computer back to someone who won't fucking embarrass themselves.    Plus you're old.   and way too ugly for posting several pictures on websites like friendster... which now should be called terrifyingpictures-sitester... quite frankly you were asking for trouble Mr. Toad.    You are my hero, Gia  P.S. as a fashion note... red lipstick only brings more attention to your horrific mouth and razor sharp animal killing teeth, just say no!

      Dear Susan,    I heard you were a hippy. Hippies remind me of down syndrome children. You know, all that free love bull shit, and seeing the good and what not. OH THE BEAUTY!The happy for no fucking reason, mostly because they can't handle anything else, fat kids running and hugging legs, wrapping themselves around trees because maybe its a person? no one really loves them kinda people. Are you retarded?    Nice Glasses, Gia

      Dear Susan,      I was thinking back to when you called me all coked up and you were talking about the rockhillbilly shows you just adore going to. And then you invited yourself over at 4 in the morning. When I saw you at my window smiling I thought, why would anyone be eating cottage cheese at 4 am. Then I looked closer and remembered you just don't brush your teeth.    Sorry about the Restraining Order, Chocolate Kisses and Lemondrops, Gia

      Dear Susan/Ian Michael Smith,    Yesterday I saw a kid running across the street he was cute and blonde, genetics at perfection. He stopped directly in front of my car to chase after his multicolored ball that he had so selfishly kicked into the street. I thought about running him over but I remembered that he didn't remind me of you or Simon Birch at all because he on the other hand was cute. I let him live. He should send you a thank you card or something, don't ya think?    Chocolate & candy, Gia

      Dear Susan:  I remember you once said, "I want that license plate holder that says 'TRUTH not tolerance'." I agree, truth is important, and I can't tolerate you anymore. The truth is: no one really likes you, not even your hamster. It only uses you for food pellets. please cry again, it makes us feel victorious.

      Dear Susan,  This homeless guy stopped us to ask for money.  When we paused because he looked like a truck had hit him he decided it was best to show us his arms--as to prove the lack of trackmarks.  When he did this one of my friends screamed SUSAN.  Kind like yahtzee.  It was so funny that we gave the junkie 50 bucks for being like you.  Sabrina_C

      Dear Susan,  That time I had the party was the best. You showed up late and drunk after all my other friends had arrived. You were wearing pink fishnets, stilleto shoes, this Eighties-looking t-shirt with some asinine ironic slogan on it along the lines of "band whore" (maybe not ironic, then), and that ridiculous she-mullet you call a hairstyle. That wasn't embarassing at all. Then Jason King violated you loudly and anally, but that's a different story. I totally want my good friends to think I socialize with ugly whores. Ugly clown whores. Thanks.

      Can you guess the title?  thats right!  Susan.  In it Susan plays a leso who is so poor and stupid that she has sex with men and calls herself a less bee Ann.  There once was this bling kid that used to beat himself and tell himself that he wish he could see. It was the saddest thing I had ever seen until I saw this wretched filth.  Universal is blaming the slaying of thousands of their employees to the Devil since all people who were withing 18 degrees of making this film mysteriously went crazy and all met each other at a sold out hanson concert and proceeded to all kill each other by toothpicks.  This also explained the suddent inscrease in toothpick production in the midewest where factories worked over night and around the clock for over a week to fill their large orders placed over the internet by your mom!

Give the old dungeon some breathing room you dumb hoe... oh yeah&nbsp;AND...&nbsp;wash the shit. What kind of fucking nimrod gets&nbsp;7 yeast infections... hey if it itches and it isnt going away, and you keep getting&nbsp;it... how about you stop letting the black&nbsp;students in your class&nbsp;do your gynecology exams you cheap fat bitch and realize that maybe the itching is from fucking that bald red assed baboon looking&nbsp;flea bag of a boyfriend or maybe its from the fungus&nbsp;your unruly pubic hair is sustaining which has&nbsp;taken over&nbsp;the lower half of your body...

      Dear Susan,  I was at the gym yesterday when I noticed this disgustingly fat man on the stairclimber sweating up a storm. He was stepping like there was no tomorrow. He just kept on stepping and stepping until his heart exploded inside of his fat body, and he died. When the paramedics came they told us that 10 minutes prior to dying he shit his pants. Nasty, awful stinking man. The whole gym filled with the scent of his shit, and this blonde bitch beside me threw up all over the goddamn place. It was a real mess. Completely and utterly disgusting. I have never seen something so vile...  ..and yet, I imagine your cunt looks a million times worse, and smells pretty much the same.   Love, C xoxoxoxo  &nbsp;

Your mere existence is a giant, oozing scabies sore on the flesh of the human race.  Do us all the favor and go frollick blindfolded in traffic.     Regards, The Diva

      Dear Susan,  This is pretty neat. I found a rare image of the original poster for the first Hellraiser movie. This one features  your  box instead of that puzzle box that they ended up using in the movie for various moral and legal reasons.      I only have two questions:   1. What's with all that green shit on your vag? Is that moss or some St. Patrick's Day thing? 2. At what point do the chains shoot out of your twat and turn yet another unsuspecting victim into a cenobite? I'll bet that looks pretty cool when it happens.  Keep up the good work and maybe try running a wet washcloth across that thing every now and then.

      Dear Susan,  Your mother was an insufferable, lonely, bitch of a woman.  She couldn't even get Petey, the one legged, black quadrapalegic from down the hall to throw her a mercy fuck...She had to jerk him off into a cup and insert his man sauce with a turkey baster.  Looking at how quickly you've grown up it's safe to say the apple doesn't seem to fall far from the tree, you malignant little whore.  Drink A.I.D.S. and Die, The Diva

      Dear Susan,   It's Mom. I just got those pictures from our vacation in Salt Lake City developed, and there's noe with your father cum all over face. I tore it apart. I'd hate for your Uncle Mike to see it, and know that you're cheating on him.   Mom

      Dear Susan,  There once was a bird the size of a turd sitting on a telephone pole.  he cocked his little neck and craped a little crap. It looked like some sap so you went up to it and put it on your eyes.         That explains the crap on your eyelids.    A friend of "A Little Bird", Talia

      Dear Susan, you keep asking me who your "dad" is.  i guess you are at the age now where i can tell you the real truth.  when i was 14 we ran out of toilet paper and i used an old tissue from the trash to wipe my oozing cunt.  somebody must have just used that last bit of the t.p. to jack off a big load into, and thus you were concieved.  im pretty sure it was my brother jimbo, but it might have been uncle mike.  hope this helps. love, MOM

      Hey everybody...and Susan,  You might already know me. My name's Weird Al Yankovic. I have been getting tired of writing my wacky song parodies about food (I've been doing it for almost 25 years now!) and was getting burned out. Then I discovered this wonderful site called "Dear Susan". So now I've decided to devote my sardonic songwriting skills to penning parodies about the pariah named Susan. I'll be posting bits and pieces of works in progress on here from time to time for your perusal and enjoyment. Here's two very rough parodies I've been working on lately. Best Regards!  Ass Junkie (to the tune of  the Beastie Boys Brass Monkey)  Ass Junkie Your trunk is funky And skunky, drunkie Youre such a flunky Your ass has a stench thats so unreal    Youre an Ass Junkie but that's how you deal Put your left leg down your right leg up Tilt your head back and guzzle my spunk Your Dad with the bottle, King rocks your can Susan gives ass to every man...   Cum Where You Will (to the tune of Nirvanas Come As You Are)  Cum where you will In my ass On my grill Where you want Take your fill Fuck my cunt Or my rump  Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah  And I swear that I dont have the HIV No, I dont have the HIV...

      I'm so sick of all this diet talk.  Everyone I know has been caught up in it for the last week, I too am guilty of it.  I just can't hear anymore about it.  Everyone's body is different and everyone needs different things for them to lose weight.  I dunno why we all have to talk aobut it so much.  I say we all just do what we gotta and get skinny and cute!  Its just the winter blahs kicking in and making everyone hide under their sweaters.  Pounds are always added on in the Winter, its just a fact of life.  Once the warm weather rolls around we'll all be feeling better about ourselves.    Superbowl is on right now.  It sucks.  Well its good that Tampa Bay is winning, but so far: commercials SUCK and the halftime dealy with sting and no doubt and a lip syncing Shania Twain was poop on parade.

      Okay, so I'm on this awful  urlLink Atkin's Diet .  I suppose its not really all that bad.  I miss the sweets, especially twizzlers, samoas and  urlLink Dunkin' Donuts , in particular my medium french vanilla with milk & 4 sugars! )c:  I'm making it through though because although he doesn't agree with it, my boyfriend was sweet enough to stock me up on my clear american black cherry seltzer.  Although it has no nutritional value whatsoever (0 cals, 0 carbs, 0 sodium and 0 sugar) its soooo good!  It helps with my sweet needs.    Anyhow, I've been on the diet since monday and by tuesday I was ready to quit, but I tested myself last nite and I'm in "moderate ketosis" (where your body starts burning its own fat for energy) and I should be full on into it tonight.  This morning however, I was feeling particularly down and since I'm a glutton for punishment I weighed myself.  I was so nervous getting on the scale, but there it was in crisp black numbers:  I LOST 4 POUNDS! .  Needless to say thats helped get my spirits up.  I just want to take off about 15 lbs and then I'll be happy.  Once I get close to my target weight I'm going to start S L O W L Y putting my carbs back in and kickin' it up a notch at the  urlLink gym .  No one really cares about this stuff, but its my blog and I can write what I want.  :p

      Judge Robert Sweet is my hero.  He has finally been able to step up to the masses of ignorant American's and greedy lawyers and end the insanity that is frivolous lawsuits.    Judge Sweet is the magistrate presiding over the  urlLink "McDonalds made my kid fat"  lawsuit.  Earlier today Judge Sweet dismissed this lawsuit commenting "Where should the line be drawn between an individual's own responsibility to take care of herself and society's responsibility to ensure others shield her? The complaint fails to allege the McDonald's products consumed by the plaintiffs were dangerous in any way other than that which was open and obvious to a reasonable consumer."  I have been saying this for quite some time now.  When are people going to stop blaming all their problems, ignorance and otherwise boneheaded behavior on others?  Why hasn't  urlLink natural selection  selected against people who're lacking common sense?  How are juries full of people awarding millions of dollars to these bumpkin retards?  I'll be the first one to say that I don't think its fair for these global corporations to be rolling in money without giving something back, but really is allowing every idiot from a trailer to sue because they're too stupid to be responsible for themselves setting a good example?  I think not.    I'm just glad that someone else out there how saw utterly ridiculous this lawsuit was.  No healthy girl can eat a McMuffin for breakfast and a Big Mac for dinner everyday and maintain her figure unless she has some serious issues with bulemia or a wicked affinity for the "horse".  Argh, I hate people like this.  Blech.  Die!

      Went to Mohegan Sun on Friday for some good old fashioned Injun gambling.  As many of the people I was with noticed: no indians actually work there, and if they did they were super incognito, or just got really good haircuts and traded in all their wampum for a nice 3 piece suit.    The day was disappointing early on to say the least.  I lost about $60 in the first twenty minutes or so that I was there because slot machines are straight up evil.  I learned how to play  urlLink Keno .  Keno is a very useless game.  You don't win a lot of money, its very slow paced and they put you in this living room setting with armchairs filled with old people.  It seems like one of those waiting rooms where people go to die.  Seriously, I must have played for about half an hour all together maybe forty five minutes and I was the youngest person in the room the entire time.  It was me and my boyfriend and then the entire geriatric field trip group from Shady Grove retirement home.    Anyhow, the boyf and I got separated from the people we'd orginally come with and began to wander in search of food.  In our travels we ended up finding them and ate some entirely overpriced and not particularly delicious buffet where I saw the biggest abuse of a  urlLink rascal scooter  known to man.  Some gigantic el slobo fatty was rolling around in it from buffet station to station with his awful army green shirt riding up his gelatinous gut the entire time.  For christ's sake, cover that thing up!  After our disgusting lunch and after I'd chucked my cookies (note to self: don't eat crabcakes at an Indian casino that is nowhere's near any body of water) we decided we were ready to hit the tables for some rockin' gaming action.  We passed up black jack, spanish 21, roulette and baccarat for one game and one game only: Casino War!!  Yes, that's right, I said War, like W-A-R spells war, like you learned when you were little.   urlLink Casino War  owns your ass, and is a GREAT way to get cash when you're down.  I don't think there is any where else in the casino that any of us could have turned $20-40 into $200 and had so much damn fun doing it!  If only that bastard asian man with bad breath hadn't sat down next to the boyf and taken all the good cards, we all prolly would have come out winners.    Moral of this story:  if you're ever strapped for cash in upstate CT make sure you go to mohegan sun and sit your ass down at the Casino War table and get your win on.

       **Disclaimer: if you work in an office of uptight suits with a gestapo-esque I.T. department you shouldn't click this link**    urlLink This  intrigues me.  Why is it called a decorator penis?  Whats so particularly decorative about this penis that other penises are lacking?  Do we really need ejaculating dildos?  Futhermore, do we really need a recipe for cum?  With all that said lets not forget the most obvious question here: are women really stupid enough to shove condensed milk up thier cooch.  Do the words "yeast infection" mean nothing to anyone anymore?    This whole aparatus seems like entirely too much work.  Give me the  urlLink hello kitty vibrator  any day.  Its even an officially licensed sanrio product.  Cute & satisfying...gotta love Japanese ingenuity.

      Sometimes I think the people I work with are purposely trying to force me to flip out.  No one could possibly as stupid, socially inept or bad at hygeine as these people.  They're mongrels, every last one of them.    I don't think there is a single one of them that could  urlLink pass even the simplest IQ test .  Honestly, I don't get paid enough money to sit here and listen to their mindless drivel, and corny jokes for seven hours a day.  I especially can't handle the fact that I have to sit in the cube next to the grosso wheelchair guy.  He always smells like piss and clips his fingernails at his desk, but the worst part is  his fucking fingernail shrapnel lands on my desk!  Ew! Ew! Ew!  I'm sure he hasn't realized the  urlLink science and art that is fingernail clipping .  One day when both my mom and I are out sick (or even on a weekend), I hope this f'n building burns down...no wait, I hope it implodes, some how that seems cooler.

      Do you think when the internet was still the ARPA-net way back when in the 1960's and the threat of nuclear war loomed heavy over everyone's head that they could have ever imagined their fancy information transferring system would become a vapid wasteland of spam e-mails & sites, as well as a soapbox for any idiot with the skills to type to give their two cents to the world?  I sincerely hope not, and I'm sure those scientists are rolling over in their graves every time someone accesses a site like the following nuggets of filth I present to you:   urlLink Work From Home  -  Ugh die, I don't want to stuff envelopes for you and I don't believe Chuck & Belinda from Two Roads Backwoods, Arkansas really made 100,000 on your system last year.  If so why are they still living in their trailer in AK and why are they still missing teeth?   urlLink  The Hamster Dance  - I hope the women at "Dotcomladies.com" die a horible painful death when their children, spouses and other pets finally get so sick of hearing that goddamned "doo duh dee doh doo duh dee doo" that they just go right for the jugular.  Blargh!  Die!   urlLink Smiley's  - When did punctuation start going berzerk and work its way into our cultural lexicon along with a multitude of other useless and equally obnoxious expressions like "lol", "IMO", "brb" , and "Rotfl".  No one gives a shit what you think or how hard you're laughing.  In fact you're probably not even laughing so "STFU!"   urlLink The "End" of the internet  - Then you get these comedian wannabes who think just because their mother tells them they're funny that they are allowed to further propagate examples of their retardation to the world.  You're not funny, you've filled my inbox with quaint jokes and beat even remotely funny spoofs to death (i.e. those master card priceless jokes)  Finally, I wont link to it becuase it spreads its own form of disease through email, but I want to give a gigantic  FUCK YOU  to those bungholes who just got email last week or haven't realized yet how annoying it is when people send endless chain letters, surveys and "forward this to people and Bill Gates & the Gap will send you a million bajillion dollars every week for the rest of your life".  You ignorant bumpkin.  There is no Bill Gates, furthermore if there even was he prolly wouldn't use something as "antiquated as e-mail", Bill would send his messages through a classier, more hi-tec medium, like hologram technology, duh!

       Now who'll be my neighbour?     I know Patches already posted this, but its the first time I had a chance to get online, you bastards!  America's favorite neighbour, Fred Rogers, passed away Thrusday from stomach cancer at the ripe old age of 74.  He entertained generations of America's youth with trips on a trolley car to the  urlLink "Land of Make Believe"  and a smattering of  urlLink snappy cardigans and skippy sneakers.     Some interesting Mr. Rogers facts: For many years, Mr. Rogers mother knitted all of the sweaters worn on the program.  Mr. Rogers has worn over 25 different sweaters over the course of the program.  He was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania (the same place where Rolling Rock beer is born).  "Mr. Roger's neighbourhood" first aired in 1963 on the Canadian Brodasting Corporation  The final episode of Mister Roger's Neighbourhood aired in 2001, making it the longest running show ever.  In 2002 President George W. Bush awarded Fred the highest civillian honor, the Preidential Medal of Freedom, for his work with the well being of children.  R.I.P. Mister Rogers.

       Sweet, Syrupy, Ottery Goodness   Back in the day when I was just a lil Diva, I used to love a delectable frozen treat known as the  urlLink Otter Pop.   There were six crazy characters whom I loved in my youth Alexander the Grape, Strawberry Short Kook, Louie-Bloo Raspberry, Sir Isaac Lime, Poncho Punch and Little Orphan Orange.  All equally as tasty, all equally as intriguing.  I decided to look further into the Otter Pop story and I present you the following links of ottery goodness:   urlLink Otter Pop HQ : Perhaps the greatest bastion of Otter Pop knowledge.  In-depth assesments of each othe Pop personalities, war strategies, journal entries, games, experiments and art work.  Sadly, it has come to my attention that my most beloved pop, Strawberry Short Kook, has a drug problem.  Check it out: "The shortest member of team Otter Pop, Strawberry Short Kook is beloved by all for the adorable "pickles" she gets herself into. Like not being able to reach the top shelf. Or overdosing on quaaludes. It hurts her when the other Otter Pops call her shorty, but she laughs anyways, because she has her art and a crate that makes her less short. Probably the most popular of all the Otter Pops, mostly because of her refusal to wear any sort of shirt."  Stop picking on her, you bastard Otters!!  **this site is pretty much the pinnacle of Ottery entertainment, the rest I just found in Google**   urlLink Otter Pops that didn't make it  some are quite funny.  Better than the one at OPHQ cuase this one has pictures.  Simpletons like me loves us some pictures.   urlLink The Otterpops (a band)  go check out the site for the now defunct band, the Otterpops   urlLink Raphael's Rant on why Otter Pop Shots Ruined his life.    urlLink The Otter Pop shot, as referenced above.

       Atta-girl!   Aside from countless jokes about their  urlLink bad teeth  , the British are back in the headlines...this time for their new appraoch to preventing teen pregnancy.  They're not promoting abstinence, they're not handing out condums in the schools, oh no my friends, they're reaching out to the under 16 student population and promoting  ORAL SEX   Thats right, 10,000 students in Britain's secondary schools are participating in a program called  urlLink A Pause , which promotes experimentation with oral sex in an effort to reduce the number of kids engaging in sex and in turn reducing the British teen-pregancy rate, the highest in Western Europe.    I want them to put these Pause teachers out on the front-line in our pending war with Iraq.  Send them out as missionaries to the uptight Muslim coutries in the world, let them know the wonders of the oral treats...they'll lighten up.  No one can be unrelaxed while getting treats, forget all these disarming resolutions we're trying to pass in the U.N.   Oral is the real key to the peace process.  All we are saying is give b.j.'s a chance.   Thanks to Kooky's away message for this story

       The Diva's Cooking School: Grilled Cheese   Welcome kids to todays excitng lesson here at the Diva Cooking School, today we're making Grilled Cheese.  To get started you'll need the following ingredients:       3 slices of the bread of your choice 1 croissant Butter or margarine spread 10 slices of american cheese (Land O'Lakes is perferred)  Triple Decker grilled cheese: Butter one side of each piece of bread.  Place the first slice of bread (butter side down) into a frying pan over medium heat and place the cheese on the side facing up.  (See Photo)     After the first side has had a chance to simmer, add the second piece of bread (butter side out) and flip the sandwich to brown this side.    While this side is browning and the first cooked side is facing up add more cheese and the final piece of bread butterside out.    Once the second side has had a chance to flip, put the third side face down in the pan and allow this to brown.    Remove from the pan and serve.  It should look something like this:        For a second delicious recipe I give you the bonus "Croissant grilled cheese":  Halve the croissant as pictured below (this one got a lil sloppy and broke into fours)     Follow a standard grilled cheese recipe and voil!  Croissant grilled cheese!  This one wasn't as tasty as I had hoped it'd be and it looked a little wierd, but I think its just because it needed more cheese...well, that and its french (eeew)      I hope you enjoyed these delectible recipes.  Tune in next week, same blog time, same blog channel!!

      I'm jealous of Tina's blog (see 2/14/03).  Its pretty and has cows & milk and most importantly humor.  Seriously though, she's so cool...even her music is cool.  bis, Lucious Jackson, the Cardigans...if only she likes  urlLink Superchunk  then I'm going to have to have a hitman take out her hubby and then I can swoop in.  Okay, maybe this is turning into one of those single white female dealies.  You can all watch dimentia set in as I slowly obsess over her and rename this blog to "Musing about Tina"...  Ok I'll stop I'm just  insanely  bored at class.  My teacher is stiing here trying to explain the point of fonts and how people hand draw them and a ton of other shit no one cares about.  When it comes time to learn what we're here for (Microsoft Word, for business no less!) she literally knows nothing about what we're supposed to be learning.  She just told us the only way you can select text  to reformat a document is "format -> font and scroll thru the font list".  Bah she's a fucking idiot.  I wonder if I brought a blowgun and darts next week I could take her out from this seat.  Hmmm....  In the mean time you can check out my  urlLink Cool Class Webpage  (which she reffered us to except its not for this class its for Business Application Software, different class.  Todays interesting class facts: Fonts with serif are best to use when writing to people over 40 years old because it helps them follow the type. Computers shouldn't make fonts of your handwriting becuase then someone could forge a nasty note to your boss, and he wouldn't know it was printed out and you'd get fired.

      Ladies and gentlemen, I give you  urlLink  Debbie Gibson's Electric Youth Perfume .  When I went through my big Debbie Gibson phase I acutally owned this perfume.  I cant tell you what it smells like, but I remember the bottle so well, the black ribbed cap, the pink coil around the straw.  It just looked cool.  This reminds me of my second grade birthday party when my best friend, Diana, got me the Debbie Gibson Electric Youth Tape!  After all my friends left I stayed out on the deck replaying the song and making up this unmatched dance of greatness.  Alas, Debbie Gibson is no more, she's now "Debra Gibson" and she sucks.  But with  urlLink lyrics like this  how could she have faded away so quickly.  I knew every word of that goddamned song and when I get home tonite you bet your sweet ass I'm gonna get it from  urlLink Limewire , the thing is I dont remember "take it fred"....wierd.

      Now that its cold out I wish I had some  urlLink Freezy Freakies .  Perhaps their magical color changing ways would make me feel less bad about the cold if I were being entertained.  I miss the 80's I had this great pair that were like this pretty red mitten with a rainbow on 'em and when you went outside a purple pegasus/unicorn appeared!  My brother had these ones with all these mechanical dials on them and when you went outside the gauge indicators started to show up.  It was cool.  Now I must go scour ebay for them, although I know where I can find some in Manhattan if all the greedy grubs haven't snatched them up!  On the opposite end of the temperature color change fashion spectrum is the awful urlLink Hypercolor Clothing  this is one trend even if i could find I wouldn't want to relive.  I remember if you put 'em in the dryer too many times they stopped changing colors.  My brother got the good one it was blue and turned pink.  I got this ugly green and yellow one cause I was too fat for any other ones.  They also always changed colors around your pits which was uber-embarassing. Blech

Any chick who rocks that hard and has  urlLink State  references littering their blog is A-Ok in my book.  So Tina, todays crappy blog entries that I make are dedicated to you...in that non-single white female stalkey kind of way.

      Okay, I cracked...class is too boring to not blog.  So I'm back.  And I'm the bearer of good news:  On my way to school today I stopped at Burger King.  I should preface this by saying that I havent eaten fast food in about 2 years, so needless to say I was a little disappointed to find out they discontinued my favorite lil snacky the rodeo cheeseburger.  Even better though, I discovered that they brought back one of my old BK favorites: the Italian Chicken sandwich.    Now I know what you're saying "ew gross" and I agree, there something entirely wrong with eating a chicken parm from Burger King, but its just so good.  Fake sauce, fake chicken, fake cheese...is there anything better?  Only the side of onion rings and frozen coke.  God,  no wonder I'm always bitching about a diet....

      Why is Led Zeppelin's "Fool In the Rain" such a good fucking song?  Oh, baby   Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining  Like a star that can't wait for the night  I hate to think I've been blinded baby  Why can't I see you tonight?   And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin'  And the thrill of your touch gives me fright  And I'm shaking so much, really yearning  Why don't you show up, make it all right?  Yeah, it's all right.   And if you promised you'd love so completely  and you said you would always be true  You swore that you would never leave me, baby:  What ever happened to you?   And you thought it was only ?....?  As you wish all your dreams would come true--Hey  It ain't the first time believe me, baby  I'm standin here feeling blue  Yeah I'm blue   Now I will stand in the rain on the corner  I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown  Another ten minutes no longer  And then I'm turning around   The clock on the wall's moving slower  My heart it sinks to the ground  And the storm that I thought would blow over  Clouds the light of the love that I found   Now my body is starting to quiver  And the palms of my hands getting wet  I've got no reason to doubt you baby,  It's all a terrible mess   I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless  When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey  The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless  I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block

      All this terrorism alert mumbo jumbo has got me a little too paranoid.  For instance there is a very high terrorism warning that was issued this past weekend for our country, but for New York City in particular.  I spent my whole weekend on the city and the alert was issued for soft targets: hotels, subways, apartment buildings, etc.  Basically just places with low security and high body counts.    Anyhow, I get onto the subway and I notice this guy get on.  I notice him initially because he was very good looking.  He sits down across from my friend and I.  I see something on his backpack that catches my eye.  A  urlLink Palestinian Flag  patch surrounded by some arabic style writing.  My friend was talking to me, but I just kept staring at this guy, staring at the backpack, wondering if this was America's first suicide bomber.  I wanted to whisper to my friend that we should get off the train, but I didn't want the guy to see me say anything.  Obviously it ended up being nothing, but I'm scared of myself for even thinking like that.  I'm scared that even if I was thinking of something like that I was too paralyzed to go do anything about it.  I'm scared that I don't trust people anymore.  Im scared that I have to live in this stupid fear.  Im scared that I'm not one of those people who can just throw their caution to the wind and just party.

       urlLink Mary-Kate & Ashley Olson  are trying to take over the world.  Singng their evil siren songs, making their dirty movies that no one watches except dirty males trying to run a batch and now they've ventured into every conceivable kind of merchandizing you can think of.  Home fashions, clothing and now bath & beauty products.  Last week I went to  urlLink Wal*Mart  and purchased a Mary-Kate and Ashley bath pouf for the shower at the gym.  Two days later I got pink eye...those evil lil vixens!    I find it interesting that on their website they've dedicated a whole page to  urlLink "plus size girls" ...these toothpick thin little wenches are trying to be socially acceptable and talk about curvy girls?  Please...go choke on your puke you bulemic lil wenches!  In their  urlLink "Hip Picks"  section the girls tell us what their favorite things are at the moment.  Look at how thoughtful little Ashley is when talking about her favorite cd ""Their Greatest Hits: The Record" by the Bee Gees -- "in memory of band member Maurice Gibb, I had to mention this album. Every sleepover should include a little classic disco, and the Bee Gees are perfect for a fun night with friends."  I don't think they could even name one single Bee Gees song...they probably only put it on their site to drive more traffic to it when people were googling "Maurice Gibb".  Promo whores!  ugh...I hate them...blech...die!

      In a weird twist of events I realized JLo has written a ghettofied song version to help me with each of my most failed and perhaps emotionally crippling relationships.  She's put into words almost everything I've wanted to say to them.  So  urlLink Joe B  this link is for you...but a certain someone has been up my ass lately so this blog entry is dedicated to you....  Dear T, "It's been awhile since you came around Now ya wanna see what's goin' down Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind  See it never had to be this way You should of never played the games you played Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame Knowin how the situation changed  Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, now I can smile and say Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say Ain't it funny  I remember how you walked away Even when I tried to call your name See at first I didn't understand Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (lonely man) I remember how you did me wrong And now you're hurtin' cuz my love is gone Everybody gets a chance to burn You can take it as a lesson learned  Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, now I can smile and say Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say Ain't it funny  I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce Tryin' to blind me with your bling bling Thought I told you love don't cost a thing Hope you realize that now I'm through And I don't ever wanna hear from you I had enough of bein' there for you Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool Ain't it funny?"  From, Gwen P.S. Your junk is  really  little...sucker!

      This weekend I went to  urlLink Ikea  with the boyf.  Goddamn, I love that wacky Sweedish shoppe (see, the extra "pe" makes it foreign...like the vitamin shoppe).  I was surprised at how uncrowded it was there compared to last time I was there.  Oh and in exciting Ikea news they changed the kids menu!  No longer does your $1.99 get you a hot dog and french fries, but now you have your choice of that or some  Y U M M Y  mac & cheese.  Woo hoo!  There was some wierd stuff going on in there....this woman who was speaking either Italian or Portugese had her entire shopping cart filled with tea lights.  If you're even remotely familiar with Ikea, you know they sell about 200 tealights in a sack that will cost you about $3.00.  This woman had an entire shopping cart full of those bags of tealights.  I mean more than 10 bags.  Thats like over 2,000 tealights.  I appreciate that its a good deal, but c'mon, is there really a need for all those tealites?  Is there some hidden black market for tealites that I am unaware of?  If so how do I get in on this.  I wanna be the king pin of a tealite crime syndicate.  Anyhow aside from that there were these lil teenybopper girls who we couldn't get away from.  They were bracefaced and with their dad, well he was following them at a "cool" distance.  The worst part about them (aside from their mindless chit chat about the "uncool" kids at school and "OMG OMG OMG can you BELIVE her") was they weren't even shopping for the myriad of cool stuffs Ikea has, they were shopping for furniture...couches, kitchen tables, entertainment units.  At 13, who the fuck needs that?!?  Other than that it was magical and sad at the same time.  I found the nicest furniture I wanted, but I was broke as a joke when we got there.  Le sigh, le sigh...

      I'm a big freak wierdo.  Not only am I spreading my hella contagious  urlLink conjunctivitis  all over the tri-state area, but now Im having wacky dreams.  Well, they didn't just start, but I keep having these dreams that I'm  urlLink Sabrina the Teenaged Witch.   I dream that I date  urlLink Harvey Kinkle , I dream that I have magic powers when I wiggle my finger, but I never dream of episodes I've already seen...I find myself in situations totally unrelated to the show, but still involving many of the characters.  Although I'm my ususal diva self in my dreams, not Sabrina, but I still see myself as  urlLink Melissa Joan Hart .  I think I'm fucking psychotic.  Why do I keep having these dreams?  When I'm not having these dreams I'm having these other ones where I'm trying to get my whole family inside my house and lock all the windows and doors becuase a pack of  urlLink mountain lions  are trying to get inside and kill my family.  Except my family keeps trying to go outside and just pretend nothings happening or they try and let the cats inside.    I think I need therapy.

       Dolphins: Not Just For Tuna Salad Anymore...   The United States Navy has a new weapon in the War on Terror in Iraq:  urlLink Dolphins!   Apparently these aquatic mammals are being used to detect land mines under the water with their sonar abilities and point out the mines to soldiers which allows them to avoid or possibly diffuse them.  This leads me to wonder:  are the famous dolphins going to be protected or sent to work?  I mean dolphins like "Snowflake" the Miami Dolphin's Mascot and star of critically acclaimed Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Flipper who had a TV series AND a movie are already trained to do complicated stunts.  Wouldn't it make sense that these guys should need less training to be helpful...or will their "celeb" status protect them and keep them safe from a possible dolphin draft.  I think its left to be seen.    Upon discussion of this topic with my coworker, Twan Money, I was presented with the idea of what if a dolphin misses a mine?   urlLink "I love bumble bee, bumble bee tuna!"   And on a completely random note (still keeping with maritime activity and mammals though), I give you:  urlLink Twiggy, the waterskiing squirrel!  coming soon to a boat show near you!

       It Never Fails That...  I buy something really cool and somehow misplace it within 24 hours, rendering said cool purchase useless.  I finally let my guard down again and some bunghole has to go remind me of why I keep my guard up in the first place.  Boys are poop!  I put on my favorite pair of underware and surprise: I get my period which somehow was mysteriously late.  I open the hallway closet and no matter how neatly the sheets are folded one always falls on my head.  I start a school semester excited about my classes and end up withdrawing from half of them before the semester is through.  The person you WANT to call never does and the person you DON'T WANT always does.  One of my six cats will throwup in the house, and the moment I take my shoes off I'll step in it.  My mom will cook the "good dinners" on nights when I have school early and won't be here for 'em.

       Guess Who's Back...   I know you all missed me  TERRIBLY  whilst I was out sailing the high seas and drinking until I could hear my liver scream, but fear not, kiddies...the diva is back! (Please, stop your groaning, I can hear you!)  I haven't really learned much, but I will share a few memories & ideas with you: - The Dominican Republic is a big, fat garbage dump.  If you can avoid going there, please do so at all cost. - Celebrity cruise lines is secret code for "Kevorkian Cruise Lines"...old people who are on their last legs literally vacation there, but some of them have hot grandchildren and children. - Irving needs to shave down there...NOT ANOTHER WORD! - Indonesians make the BEST martinis and know the coolest magic tricks: SUDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! - Dana the bartender thinks I'm a big drunk, but loves me for it anyway. - Jon is embarassed to be fat and hairy when we were surrounded by 600 lb. gorilla men who wore permanent sweaters.  Please tell him how cute he is! - More Jon related news: Jon's back is "crap"...at least thats what the masseuse sitting on his head told him. - Barbados has a rockin' beach with a bad-assed beach cat! - St. Thomas has a cool-assed lil bar with a Jack Russell Terrier Bar dog!  I took his picture!   - St. Thomas also has a Sanrio store!  I loved all the great lil hello kitty, my melody and little twin stars trinkets!! - I missed my friends terribly on this cruise and I've decided at some point, we all must cruise together! - Some old people can be cool, especially guys from Grosse Pointe who look like Dustin Hoffman.  Thats all for now...embarassing photos coming later in the week!

       Oh just bring the shame already!   This weeks gay lyrics come from Third Eye Blind.  This song has been stuck in my head for 2 days.    "Motorcycle Drive-By" Summer time and the wind is blowing Outside in lower Chelsea And I don't know What I'm doing in this city The sun is always in my eyes It crashes through the windows And I'm sleeping on the couch When I came to visit you That's when I knew That I could never have you I knew that before you did Still I'm the one who's stupid And there's this burning Like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by The cigarette ash it flies in your eyes And you don't mind You smile And say the world it doesn't fit with you I don't believe you You're so serene Careening through the universe Your axis on a tilt You're guiltless and free I hope you take a piece of me with you And there are things I would like to do That you don't believe in I would like to build something But you'll never see it happen And there's this burning Like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've, I've never been so alive Where's the soul? I wanna know New York City's evil The surface is everything But I could never do that Someone would see through that And this is the last time We'll be friends again And I'll get over you You won't know who I am And there's this burning Just like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've, I've never been so alive So alive I go home to the coast It starts to rain I paddle out on the water Alone Taste the salt And taste the pain I'm not thinking of you again Summer dies and swells rise The sun goes down in my eyes See this golden wave Darkly coming To take me home And I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive

       Yeah...   Things have a really funny way of working themselves out.  For the last few weeks I've been in a serious funk.  Last night I got phone calls from a few of my old  urlLink high school  friends who are home from spring break.  People I thought I'd completely lost contact with, but everything was just the same as it'd always been.  We've made plans to hang out and go get  urlLink coffee  or check out a movie or maybe even hit up a  urlLink bar .  Hopefully it should be a good time.    There are still some things that aren't sitting right in my life, but I guess that will all have to wait for wednesday when I go to my new  urlLink shrink .  I've also realized that I have an extremely dark side to me.  This might seem unusual as most everyone knows of my affinity for bubbles, afroken and piglet, but this other side scares the crap out of me.  I have very detailed and morbid thoughts, some are extremely violent against myself, some against other people.  Thats not to say I have dreams of killing myself or hurting myself, but in my dreams many people are trying to chase and kill me.  I can feel it if I get shot, punched or stabbed.  They're so real, its scary!  I really don't want to be at work this week, like somehow thats any different than any other week, lol.  I have a bunch of stuff I need to get done, but I'd just love to be napping.  That could be really great.  Maybe I could find someone to build me a bed under my desk like in that Seinfeld episode.  Then I could call in a bomb threat and I could sleep peacefully or sneak out the back door.  Working for a living is silly.  I have to find a billionaire old man to marry like  urlLink Anna Nicole  "Anna, anna, fabulous anna, anna nicole she so outrageous!"  (Yes, I'm the person who keeps watching crap like this so networks will put more of it on, sue me!)

       A Penny Saved...   An 89 year old Plymouth, Minnesota man  urlLink donated $75,000  worth of loose change on Sunday as he was passed the collection plate at church.  Delivery took 3 pickup trucks and 12 men and while the total value of the coins is yet to be determined, those counting have estimated the ciruclated coins alone are worth $41,000.  Who said it doesn't pay to be a packrat?  Maybe my grandmother is right and all that crap she's saving WILL be worth something.  Keep your fingers crossed.

       Hello, my name is Gwen, and I'm an addict    Though some wierd twist of events I stumbled upon this website:  urlLink Lip Balm Anonymous  for those of us who are addicted to lipbalm.  But Gwen, lip balm isn't addictive...I'm certainly not an addict.  Oh yeah?  Why dont you take the  urlLink LBA Addiction Self Assessment Test .  I answered "yes" to over half the questions on this page.  I'm in too deep.    In my room I have a 15x7x7 drawer packed to the BRIM of the stuff.  I would say there are prolly close to 100 pots, sticks, tubes, deisgner and generic.  You name it, I have it.  Perhaps my most prized posessions are the 2  urlLink lip balm rings  I got at old navy.  They're fashionable and function...and no, they dont look like lil animals.    Some packages are glittery, some chapsticks are glittery, some a fruity, sweet, waxy, glossy...I love them all.  My favorites are probably the  urlLink Bonne Bell Lip Smackers  in Martian Marshmallow, Red Licorice Launch, Berry Jelly Donut and Cotton Candy.  There are some great pots too,  urlLink The Gap  made some really great flavors which came in large flat pots...my favorites there are pepermint stick and pink lemonade.  I have my  urlLink MAC LipGlass  for my Sex And the City nights out, when I need to be uber-glammy Gwen.  I have the holiday lip glosses from Old Navy...Easter shaped like a chick and a flower, Valentines day pots shaped like a heart, the winter pot shaped like a Christmas Tree and a snowflake...all my little precious. :::insert Gollum impression here:::    Between my lip gloss and hand cream application here at work, I probably only manage to do 15 minutes of actual work a day, but its not interfering with my life, I swear.  And I DEFINITLEY didn't pick a chapstick up off the floor of Red Rocks West and continue to use it becuase it would be a "waste" if I didn't.  What kind of freak would do that?  Not me I tell you, I don't HAVE to use it...I don't NEED it.  :::Pulls out stick and feverishly applies it:::  NO YOU CAN'T use it.  It's mine, get away!!

       Piss and Moan    I haven't bitched in almost 24 hours, I think I'll explode if I don't so heres a list of stuff I hate/gets on my nerves/aggrivates me: the gym stupid people most coworkers the smelly guy at work people in my classes at school gross food that stinks up the office people who feel its their right to tell you waht to do stupid tv shows work mindless meetings for no reason fridays that aren't paydays people who just talk at you like you're listening people who hover by my computer so I have to do work the IT department people who are on the phone 24/7 people who are indecisive mostly just people, I guess  I don't even have PMS this week, but I sound like I'm totally "OTR" (add to the above list the expression OTR)

      I found my Get Up Kids CD's hidden in Travis.  I think they're up they're tied for my favorite band with the Refreshments.  God, I love them.   "Forgive & Forget" I think I've waited long enough Our world was once forget-me-nots  And now I wait another year.  Now I wait another year.  I need you here.  I think I've heard this one before,  But it's not you walking through my door.  And now I wait another year.  Now I wait another year.  I need you here.  I need you here.  I need you here.  I need you here.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have all gone by.  Forgot what we fought for,  Hard as I might,  Don't have the will to fight.  Forgive & forget  Whatever was said  Because we're growing up By the hour.  I never would let  It go on like it did:  All good things  Have endings.  Forgive & forget  Whatever was said  All good things  Have endings.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have  all gone by.  Forgot what we fought for,  Hard as I might,  Don't have the will to fight.  Don't bother it now,  Let sleepers lie.  Bygones have all gone by.  Forgot what we fought for,  Hard as I might,  Don't have the will to fight.    If these are wrong, F-U...I'm too lazy to type it all out...I just ganked 'em from someone else's website

       Been Around The World and Found That Only Stupid People Are Breeding...       I love these cookies.  In fact, they own your ass.  Today I was at the grocery store on my lunch break, picking up a box for a mid afternoon smackerel of something, when I saw this putrid, little beast clad in sweatpants swipe a box off of the shelf in front of me and belch forth the following disgusting phrase (I've sounded this out phonetically to help you get the gist of this mongoloid):  "Mommy, can we get these Pet It Ecoli cookies?"   First of all, its more like "peh-tee eh-cole-yay", but thats neither here nor there.  Had this scourge to humanity acutally read the package between her chubby fingers, she would have seen that here in America, its clearly translated in english underneath to read "The Little School Boy".    So before you go thrusting these delicious chocolate works of art down your gullet, I want an honest answer:  Are you going to eat the entire cookie?  Or are you gonna be a fatty-in-training, like momma and pick off only the chocolate and discard the sumptuous, buttery biscuit beneath?    Bleh!  Die!  Those cookies should have been mine, fatty.

       Mad With Power   I'm back at work today.  There are 5 people in the office including myself, due to the heirarchy of who knows what and whose been here longest I'm in charge.  Yes, I'm 21 and I'm in charge of the office.  The only other people here are Wheelchair guy who smells, my friend Anthony, a guy called Krobot who tells everyone his last name is "Robot with a K" and an auditor.  I want to run across the countertops and pelt them all with jelly beans and scream "You're not the boss of me now!  You're not the boss of me now!  You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big!"  Alas, I'll just sit here in silence and drink my decaf tea and pray for 4 p.m., although Krobot could commit me to the occupational health mental health offices if I pulled the jelly bean stunt.  That could be entertaining.  That would, however, leave wheelchair guy in charge, he doesn't even speak English well and he smells, and I can't do that to Anthony.  Damn me and my morals!

       Sickies   Being sick with a spring cold has its pros and cons.  Cons  I want to smash my face with the claw end of a hammer to get rid of sinus pain My nose wont stop running I'm tired as hell Im weak and don't want to walk around.   Pros  You get to watch all of the good daytime tv, including dawson's creek You can walk around the house in your undies 'cause no one is around You can blog and IM all day while everyone else rots at work You can eat when you want to eat  Now that I think about it, being sick all day sounds a lot like Boz's life.

       Friday's Unintelligable Fodder   If I was a senior citizen and I had a rascal scooter to scoot around on I'd like to call myself Diva Kinevil, I would do pop-a-wheelies and jump curbs and stuff.  I'd show those lil rapscallions that depends are what the cool kids wear.  Yeah A.A.R.P!  It is *SO* amazing outside today.  Im trapped in the building until 4, but in a scant 2.5 hours I'll be free!  I will frollick in the park with my poochie, Sahara.  Woo Hoo!  I urge you all to open the windows or go outside and let the stink blow off.  It might make ya feel a lil better!  Oh and in case you didn't get the memo: its the FREAKIN' WEEKEND!  And Finally:  urlLink Roly Poly  has just opened within walking distance of my house.  I am so VERY VERY stoked about this.  "w00t".  Who wants to come over for wraps & a walk to the beach??

       eeep!   im sitting here at work.  i just got back from lunch.  I think im having a really bad panic attack...no, i KNOW I'm having a really bad panic attack.  I can't tell anyone here though so I have to look like I'm a normal worker bee, so I sit here and I write.  My hands are trembling on each key, they're sweaty and clamy and damp.  It feels like all my guts are smooshing up into a tiny ball inside my ribcage.  Its hot, but its not hot in here.  My upper lip is going numb cause I"m trying to calm my breathing.  Im scared I might pass out, Im having lil dizzy flashes.  I hope all the one oclock lunchers just get out of here so there are less people around.  I dont want to talk to anyone, yet they keep asking how my lunch was.  Stop it.  Im going to pretend to make a phone call, maybe they'll get the hint.  I dont know what to do.  I shouldn't have come back to work, but my boss is a powerhungry bitch and she makes it impossible and akward to call out.  How do i call and say Im a fucking psycho im having a panic attack I cant work.  Damn it...cant take another paxil, can't take a xanax cause i have none.  I need to sleep this off I need to shut everythign off.    Something is weighing very heavily on me and my heart right now and I'm very scared.  And there are only 2 people tops that I can talk to about it.  Im probably worrying for nothing right now and painicking for nothing, but I can't help it.  Im a natural born worrier.  This is probably nothing, and probably not even waht i think it is becuase odds of this kind of thing are one in a kajillionbazillionmillion, but iM that one kajillionthmillionthbazillionth.  Even if people were online I wouldn't be able to talk to them about this, but hopefully I could at least get my mind off of it.  Someone IM me please.  Maybe I could go throw up and then i would feel better.  Something has to stop this now.  Im breathing, im trying to do calm breathing but its hard to get myself unworked up when im like this.  I feel like crying but i cant cry at work.  I wish my mom was working today so I could go talk to her during this lil episode.  Shit shit shit.

       Random Thursday Thoughts   Its nice when you put your hand out to help someone along and rather than having to drag them to do things they finally take the intitative and walk WITH you...and they start to help themselves.  If its not rainy after work today I'm going to go to the highschool and walk a mile.  I am dreading this, but my waistline says I must.    I saved the office from being stuck smelling the stinky guy...Yankee candle company makes room spray and it works and smells yum!  Today is bring your daughter to work day.  The irony is that I'm here at work, while my mom is relaxing at home on her week off.    eBay is crack to me, although thankfully I've been outbid on most everything so I don't have to spend the acutal money.  Boz posts a lot.

       Isn't it unusual that...   We're often scared to let those people in our "real" lives close to us, we shy away, put up fronts on dates and at work and never REALLY let people in.  Yet here, in our little blogging community we (well me in particular) divulge some of the most intimate details of our personal lives that complete strangers can read and give us feed back on.  Perhaps its theraputic as we're getting a semi-objective opinion on many situations, but in a way that seems so strange to me.  Why is it that the anonymity (depending on how much of yourself you put out there) of the internet allows us to let people into our lives easier?  Is it less scary to face human interaction when its only in print?  Some people make the same crass, asshole comments that they would normally make, yet does it seem to bother you less because you don't knwo them?    Furthermore, I've been turned onto this whole "blogging lifestyle" because each new blog I discover shows me another personality, another life, another person putting themselves out there and feeds some bizzare voyeuristic side to me that I never knew existed.  Am I soon to be a peeping tom??  Aside from those listed in my sidebar, I've stumbled upon some really great blogs through clicking links in links in links...and so on.  Here's a list of a few that I love to read.  (They'll go in my sidebar soon enough so I don't have to remember how to click through to them.)   urlLink Cheeks    urlLink Amy Choppa    urlLink Attorneys Suck...or IA (Im not sure)    urlLink Mo (A Cracked Southern Belle)    urlLink Fat Free Milk    urlLink Cacoa Pulp

       Reality TV...Diva Style   Dear Fox,  I am watching "Mr. Personality" as we speak.  It appears that you pay some drunk homeless monkey to write this crap, yet for some reason I feel compelled to watch it.  However it inspires me to write a new reality T.V. show of my own...the basis of this show is poop.  That is to say the "contestant" on the show chooses their mate based on the quality, look, smell or other characteristics of the shit of those vying for her love.  I call it "Scatology Island"...can you pay me now please?  Thanks, Diva

       It Troubles Me That...   My cat, Paco, stole a hardboiled egg from the table and hid it somewhere in our house and we can't find it.  Soon the egg halflife will kick in and said egg will start to launch a fetid olfactory assault on my house.  Great, now I can't have guests for WEEKS!  Fucking cat!  Wheelchair guy at my office probably smells comprable to what this egg will smell like and is oblivious to it.    I might be forced to start running to lose weight...ick!  My paxil is starting to make me not sleep at night, but I'm not allowed to take my ambien anymore because they don't play well together.  I owe $7,000 to various creditors, not including my car and I'll probably never be able to dig out from under it.

       More Paxil Dreams   Last night I was surrounded in a traveling circus situation and all my friends were carnies but they were like these wierd vampire carnies...anyhow these nascar trailers kept flipping over and killing people and eventually I had to swim to this island where there was a battle of the good, non-evil carnies (myself included) versus the bad ones (all my other friends and various assorted ghoulies).    Anyhow, at this island we had to burrow down deep (like 2 miles) into this rock so we'd be safe.  We found a lagoon in the core of the cave except the walls were made out of cooked salmon-esqe smooshy flaky stuff so it was hard to keep them out.  We all had a rainbow color assigned to our powers and we used that to seal off the enterance we used to get into the cave.  Unfortunately the ghoulies came down into our cave and morphed into these ork-like creatures from LOTR and we had to fight them.  I hid behind a rock in the upper corner 'cause I'm a big chicken shit.  Anyhow, I had to fight the last ghoulie, who was my ex-boyf, Joe B. (see "You Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks")  I flew down and I turned into this AWESOME green dragon with green flames shooting out of my mouth and I burned him but he cut off my tail and I fell and broke my back, he picked me up and was trying to repair me and I buried I knife up to the hilt in his hip.  Apparently this made him unevil and he fell in love with me, even though I was a dragon with no tail and a broken back....then I woke up.  I wish i could say I was making this shit up so that I would feel less wierd about it, but this is what I dream, every night I have wierd, crackhead dreams like this....what the hell?

       Random Thursday Thoughts   When your doctor tells you to take your paxil everyday, once a day, its probably not a good idea to forget to take it since Saturday, because you'll feel like a miserable, nauseous shitbag for the duration of the week.  Oh yeah, and you get nightmares too!  Last nite I dreamt I had a baby named Terrance Andrew.  He was beautiful.  I also dreamt that I fought Jeff S. inside a black SUV for being a cheap fuck.  I also dreamt that I was in this wierd orgy house and every room had different fetishes in them.  I was trying to wander out and I walked in on Jon, Missy, Anna and Randi fully clothed lying in a bed getting their feet tickled with a feather.  I guess this random thought belongs with the previous "make sure you take your paxil" thought.  I live with my grandparents, well, they live in our house with us...my grandfathers sister died this weekend and now he's the only one of his family left.  Is it appopriate to send him a sympathy card.  I feel so bad for him, I just wanna smoosh him.    About a month ago,  urlLink the fuzzy one  and  urlLink whitey's bitch  made Leon Klinghoffer jokes in my post cruise blog comments.  I didn't get them until 2 days ago when they caught the guy who hijacked the Achilles Lauro or whatever.  I never heard of Leon Klinghoffer, prolly because in 1985, when he was killed I was only 4.   urlLink This is the funniest fucking thing I've seen in a long time and Im ordering one of their goddamned T-shirts!  Go play here!   Oh yeah and if you've been living under a rock, crawl out and go check out  urlLink Homestar Runner .  This concludes our blogging broadcast day...for now.

       The Wisdom of Pooh      These are some very true quotes by a bear of very little brain:  "Sometimes when late morning rolls around and you're feeling a bit out of sorts, don't worry, you're probably just a little eleven o'clockish."  "Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon."   "When you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, and you Think of Things, you sometimes find that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it."  "Poetry and Hums aren't things which you get, they're things which get you. And all you can do is to go where they can find you."   Pooh is oh so wise.  I wonder if someone would be nice enough to buy me the "Tao of Pooh" from my  urlLink Amazon.com Wishlist .  God, that was a shameless plug!

       You Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks   Okay, I'm a fucking humungous idiot.  I was in the process of "seeing where things went" with an ex of mine, and lo and behold this weekend the truth finally came out...I found out: a) he's dealing A LOT of weed  b) he's dealing oxicontin, darvocet, xanax and a myriad of other pills  c) he's crating engines (stealing for those of you not in the know) from cars for cash.   d) he's a major weed/shroom/pillhead and he is ALWAYS high or under the influence.  That is drama and bullshit I do NOT want any part of.  I feel so stupid because in my head and in my heart I've tried to justify everything.  I've said to myself that he was BETTER than he was before, but its just because I was foolish enough to believe all the LIES he was telling me.  I am a fool.  A huge, stupid, asshole of a fool.  I feel compelled to try and help him, but I can't have him in my life.  Too dramatic.  I don't want to be caught with him if/when he finally gets busted.    The thought crossed my mind about turning him in, but I'm too scared of him finding out it was me to do anything, he's a bit of a loose cannon.  This weekend he told me to "shut my fucking mouth before he smacked me."  I got in his face and screamed at him that if he ever so much as threatened to put a hand on me again I would call the cops and that I wasn't scared of having him arrested.  The truth is I was so scared of how he would react to me saying that.  But it ended it.  We parted as "normal" this weekend, but he doesn't know that I've shut him out.  Can't I ever just meet a normal guy?  What the fuck?

       The Future Is BlackJack  (Alternate title: Another Crackhead Dream)   Okay so last nite I had another one of my kooky dreams.  I was in someone's driveway and this little  urlLink Jack Russell Terrier  (or parsons terrier for those of you up on your terrier facts) who was black and white came running over to me.  I looked at my friend who I was with and said "We have to keep him."   "What should we name him?" my friend asked. Simultaneously we look at each other and say "Black Jack" and with that, the black patch over his eye changed into the shape of a  urlLink spade .  Now I'm on a mission in real life...I must find a Jack Russell or a  urlLink Rat Terrier  that is black and white and I shall call him or her "BlackJack" or Jackie for short (blackie just seems too racist).  Anyhow, I tell my friend to take the dog to the car so I can go use the facilities and when I open the womens room door I end up in my old boyfriends  urlLink UConn  dorm room.  He and my other good friend, PJ, are in there and we start hanging out like old times.  I'm laughing cause PJ, a guy, is wearing this ridiculous bright red lipstick and I tell him to leave a fake love note to his roomate, Shane.   We all chuckle and they pass me a candy bowl.  I grab a fistful of candy and start crunching away on it.  I ask what they are as they taste so yummy and they tell me  urlLink shrooms , because they wanted to trip with me again in hopes that we might 'get stuck outside of time' again.  (See kids, drugs are bad mmm'kay?)  I start tripping and rummaging through their room and I find my old pink feather boa that I used to wear all around the halls on drinking nights.  I put it on and we just veg out and enjoy the trip.    All of a sudden I see PJ trying to hump my foot, and ask him what the hell he's doing and he says my foot has a magnet to his junk.  It was very wierd.  Anyhow I need to go the bathroom still so I go to leave and I open the door and step into an episode of the powerpuff girls.  I, of course, am  urlLink Bubbles  and I walk throgh the house which is a giant tiled swimming pool and I walk in on the  urlLink Professor  and  urlLink Sedusa  taking a bath in the jacuzzi.  They yelled at me and I woke up when my alarm went off to my  urlLink Z-100 ZMorning Zoo Horoscope .    I need to stop taking this goddamned Paxil I think its making me  MORE  crazy, if thats possible.

       Cue the porn music   This weekend I got  urlLink laid  for the first time since  urlLink June 28, 2002.   It was pretty great.  No more  urlLink "sex strikes"  for me...thats just plain silly!  So sure, none of you needed to a) think of me having sex with someone or b) hear the sordid, intimate details of my life, but its not like I told you I had anal sex with a  urlLink Penguin  or something!  Anyhow here's my recap for the rest of the weekend: Friday night I ate dinner at  urlLink Chevy's  and had some BITCHIN' mexican food and some yummy strawberry 'ritas as well.  Then I made the sex and that was also quite yay.  I also watched some movies and started playing the new Zelda game for GameCube.  Saturday I slept most of the day and then I woke up, went to eat at Steak & Ale where I had some serious steaks and lobster tails (no, its not even close to Ruth's Chris yummy goodness, but still...  urlLink I  ).  Then I went to the village to some bars and for some groovy shopping and it rawked.  Finally I came home and made  more  sex and watched Lord of The Rings again and it was joyful.  Sunday was quite sexless, but thats a-ok.  My chach needed a rest after all that.  I got a manicure with my mommy and then we headed out to  urlLink IKEA  to shoppe (remember the rule..."pe" makes it foreign...so does adding "Ye Olde") for some sweedish furniture.  It was also very yay!  Diva's daily mood:  urlLink HaPpY!

       Rain, Rain, Go Away!   Rain encompasses so many different emotions.  Some find it sad, sexy, angry, refreshing, renewing, empowering or even calming.  Its been raining here for three weeks.  I don't live in Seattle or London, I don't particularly enjoy the rain anymore as its keeping me cooped up inside and I'm getting the "cabin fever".  Today the rain is making me reminiss.  I want to go barefoot in shorts and jump in the puddles and splash around like I did when I was younger.  I want to go to Sam Murphy's house and make mud pies with all of her moms good spoons and forks and brand new tupperware, I could go to Nico's house and play office with the old business supplies lying around.  I want to go to Molly Beth's house and play dressup and put on her mum's makeup or to Adam's and build a fort out on the huge rock in his back yard with a tarp his dad gave us.    Sometimes I think I want to do my life over.  To not lose track of some of the people I miss the most.  Not waste time or give up the aforementioned people in lieu of people who will turn out to not mean anything.  I know if that happened I wouldn't be who I am today, but whats not to say that I couldn't be someone better than I am now.  Someone who has completed college, someone who has a bright shining future.  Someone who is comfortable enough in her own skin to not need to wear all these masks and be such a chameleon.  Sometimes i wish I could just be me...

       The Friday Five   Alright kiddies, heres a new feature for ya, the Diva's Friday Five, wherein I will bestow upon you some little nuggets of wisdom I picked up in the past week or so.  Strap on your harnesses and helmets and lets get ready to lick the windows together, shall we?  1) When you corner a man like the vile and otherwise skeevy rat that he is, he will fold like a cheap suit.  (Thats right, he confessed to cheating and I told him to fuck off permanently, go me!)  2) Although it seems like a good idea at the time consuming 12 drinks on a work night, dancing on the bar with your best friend (who is playing shot girl) and dancing til 1 am is not a good idea when you have to be up for work at 6:15am. (Ick!)  Similarly, being hungover at work is way underrated.  Its more painful than you could imagine...even if you are playing boss.  3) No matter how much time passes between outings, when you hang out with people who are truly your friends its like picking up right where you left off.  The scars of past battles fade with time and you can all smile together again.  4) To quote my mommy "A Leopard Can Not Change Its Spots", however its possible for a 150 lb girl to lose 200+lbs of dead weight (and look fabulous while doing it!)  5)  Sheepy cards can ALWAYS make you smile even on a very SAD day. (Thank you!)  That wraps it up for this innagural (and lame) first edition of the friday five, tune in next week fearless reader, same diva time, same diva channel.

       Iron Mike Strikes Again   In a television inteview scheduled for tonight, Mike Tyson says one of the most outrageous comments of his carrer (More crazy than the "I'll fuck you til you love me?" nah, not quite, but nutty nonetheless)  When talking about the 1991 rape of Desiree Washington he commented that the burden of being a rapist makes him want to do it now: "I just hate her guts.  She put me in that state, where I don't know, I really wish I did now.  But now I really do want to rape her."  Way to fucking be, cock pirate.  Anywho, while we're on the topic of angry young men make sure you go check out  urlLink Tazz's Blog .  Its not very aesthetically pleasing, but his rants will make you lauhg your ass off once he gets going.

That is NOT to say that I swear off sexual man friends, or booty of any kind, but full on boyfriends & relationships are off limits for at least 2 months.  This way I can get some money and get my act together.  If you're really super great though and my friends approve of you then perhaps I would be willing to make an exception.  Please send all inquiries with a photo and brief description to the "Love Letters" link above.

       Hell Hath No Fury Like Gwen's Scorn   Let this be a lesson to anyone with a penis who is thinking of double crossing me...  Joe:  You stole stuff, I backed you up  You sold & did drugs, I took you back & lied to everyone to convince them you were good. You cheated on me, I let it slide  Now you are cheating, taking drugs and still lying to me and this is where I put my foot down.   FUCK YOU, BUD!  Who do you think you are to cheat on me? With Reenie? Fucking puhleeze, man. I hope she gives you the herpes that she already has, that dirty bitch. I hope you scratch your junk until its festering and bleeding you miserable piece of shit. Blargh! I hate you and you will never ever ever get to be with me ever again. All your chances are G O N E ! I dont want you in my life, but I will continue to be friends with Colleen and Steve. If you want to fuck with me and start a war just bring it, you whiny lil bitch, I'll take you the fuck out, Gwen-style.   fin.

       Feh!   I woke up at 8pm last evening and I was vomiting like a madwoman.  I ended up finally going to the Emergency Room at 2:30 in the morning only to be stuck with an IV, give blood, drink a ton of gross "medicines" and for the doctor to finally discharge me at 5:30 becuase "he didn't kwno what was wrong".  Supposedly it was some mini g.i. bug, but lemme tell you I hate many peeps but I wish this on NO ONE.  Goodness, it was like the most miserable night of my life.  Further more, Joe is a tool.  I think I'm going to have to break up with him.  No matter how much of a scumbag I say he isn't, he defintiley is.  That creeps me out.  Also, the more I drink around peopel the more I see waht they're really like as my internal walls come down I think my "crush blinders" also come down and I see shit for what it really is.  Joe is really nothing.  Ew.  He's complacent in a life thats on a fast track to the shitter.  Now comes the akward part of having to break up with him.  Last time he was fucking insane when this happened.  Hopefully he'll be cool this time.   Also, don't go to a beach front community when its raining, otherwise they will stick you in the most disgusting mildew smelling room that is freezing cold becuase it has no heat because its "only for summer use" okay, genius, why did you stick me in there, then? I swear to god, sometimes i hate my life, lol.  Other than that, the weekend was fun, I hung out with colleen alot, which was cool, I got to spend sometime with my lil lisa!, and the claw machines on the boardwalk had afrokens!  Woooooo!

       He didn't even get his last rights   I am a miserable, loser bitch.  I have been driving for about 5.5 years and in all those years I've struck cars and people, but never cute, fluffy animals (at least ones that were still alive) today on my way back to work I hit a squirrel.  I heard this quiet "thump" against my tire, I had seen him in the road, but I had no time to avoid him.  I would have maybe felt better if I flattened the poor lil fella, but I just knocked him out and when I looked in my rearview I saw his tail flaililng around wildly...I pulled over like the pussy I am and cried for like 5 minutes.  Poor lil guy was just living his squirrelly lil life and I ended it.  I bet his momma is wondering where he is right now.  How do I tell her?  Should I send them a nice arrangement of Acorns and Peanuts to "big old oak tree....3rd nest on the right"?  Oh well, I guess I should feel better that it wasn't a black squirrell, then I prolly would have killed myself.   urlLink LFJ  made a good point...he's in squirrel heaven getting his supply of eternal nuts.  Godspeed, little fella.

       Rainy Wednesday Blahs   Its raining.  Its supposed to rain the whole long weekend.  This ruins my plans to spend my extra vacation day at the beach.  I've already gotten the room...now I'll be stuck at a rainy beach community for the whole weekend as it pours.  Oh well, I get to spend time with my Lisa anyhow, no biggie.  (c:  Someone I know, who I almost forged a relationship with has passed away.  He was in his early twenties.  Tonight is his wake.  I am going to be a support for one of my friends who was closer with him, but also to get some closure on the situation myself.  It doesn't seem quite real to me yet, but on the same hand I don't want to see him in the coffin, I don't know that I can handle seeing another body of a person my age in a casket.  I think I have to see it so I can stop being all deluded by it and try and get it off my mind, but its a scary thing.  Some people are using this as a really disgusting opportunity to further their own causes and shop for new clothing for themselves.  People like that make me want to scream.    Last night I dreamt that my mother was letting my father move back into our house.  He kept trying to talk to me and I was snide and cruel to him, I eventually just burst out into to tears and began kicking and screaming throwing a tantrum and commenting on how I don't need him and I've gotten this far with out him and I told him how great my life has been with out him.  I tried to move out, but I ended up homeless just like he had been.  God, I hate him.  Rain, rain, go away, come again some other day.

       You Want The Truth?   Boy: I never know what to believe anynmore I AbsolutAngel I: wait, what are YOU talking about? Boy: I dunno if you are ever honest with me anymore or not, and it drives me nuts I AbsolutAngel I: why does it matter? I AbsolutAngel I: like honestly why do the inconsequential details of my life bother you so much Boy: Its not so much that as the fact that going from best friends to lies and half truths through no fault of my own is a little confuding I AbsolutAngel I: well if i tell you the truth then you flip out and have a bitch fit over somethign that really isn't any concern of yours I AbsolutAngel I: so its easier for me to just tell you half the truth or tell you the truth when its convenvinet  Here is the whole truth, live and a lil late breaking but this way I can't be accused of things and this way everythign is out in the open and I can finally say everything I want to say in my blog.  I still am dating Joe.  Yes, thats right.  I am Joe's girlfriend, Joe is my boyfriend.  We date.  He  was  a scumbag and he still kind of is a little, but he's getting his life together.  You can't pass judgement on me because of who I like, love or choose to spend my time with.  If you want to get pissy over this then fine, but thats it...the whole truth.  I am dating Joe.  And yes, I really was in Massachusetts this weekend, so don't even start with that.  If we aren't friends any more becuase of this than that is superfuckinglame, but its your choice and I will respect it and back out of your life.  Bottom line.  The ball is in your court.  You decide what happens now.

       Dreams...Again   Last night I dreamt of my ex.  Its been like almost a year and a half that we've been broken up, but I would still get back with him in a heart beat.  I dreamt that we were hugging and just holding hands, walking around places and he was *SO* happy to see me.  It was awesome.  Its weird, because in real life we're still good friends and we hang out and hug sometimes, but he has his new chick and I have my new guy, but I still know he's not 100% happy with her, and he wants to go out with some REALLY hot chick, but I know I could make him so happy, and I think deep down somewhere inside his heart he knows it too.  Anyhow, the second part of my dream I was in a convenience store (ala Seven Eleven) with my mom and grandmother and the clerk ringing us up tried to charge us 97.92 for 2 packs of cigs, a snapple and 2 wa-wa peddles that were only $12.99.  We fought him, threw sodas at him and then stole his car keys and in turn his car ( a beat up 1986 honda civic, dark blue).  The cops pulled us over for stealing the car but we got out on foot and ran, but my gramma can't run, so I gave her a piggyback, then I went to school at Iona College (where the Ex goes) and it was this huge high structure with no walls and no floors just a huge cargo net thing you had to climb.  Tres scary, it was so high up.  I'm gonna miss my paxil dreams if I ever get off this.

       Umbrella   "Did you like the flowers I sent?  You could've called to thank me,  well you could've called.   I tried to kiss you  on Brooklyn Avenue,  but you got in your car, before I could move.   I've been falling like the rain,  but you've got your umbrella in my way.   Fists and fingers, tongues and teeth.  I want to see you, I'm tired of my dreams;  nights of wishing, I could open my mouth  and when I finally did speak,  you were nowhere to be found.   I've been falling like the rain--  you've got your umbrella in my way again   I had the sun in my hands  I had the sun in my hands  'til you said you liked the rain.  I had it all in my hands, I had it all  but I gave it all away.   Did I scare you off, by being honest?  how come we never see the end, 'til it's right there upon us?  If you want, I can go away,  but like the rain, I'll come again some other day.   I've been falling like the rain--  you've got your umbrella in my way again.  One of these days I'm going to come along  in the middle of sunshine and be a  little sunshower  make you rise up like a flower,  and you can be my little daisy, be my daisy. " -d.e.v.

       Neither Here, Nor There   I wish my life seemed more interesting.  Lately I've just been writing absolutely inane things, but I don't want to bore people with the remedial details of my life.  I do like to let you all in from time to time, and get your opinions, but I don't really know what I have this blog for.  Sometimes its big ranting and outpourings of feelings, sometimes its just a place to collect the smattering of ideas that run through my head so I don't forget things (being that I have a mind like a seive thats quite easy).  I vow to you all, my dear, dear readers, my blog will get better as it has been "teh suck" lately.    I think its interesting to me to look back on my earliest entries and say to myself, "God, that seems so long ago" though its only been a matter of a few months.  I can't wait until this blog is a year old and I can look back and it will really have been a while ago.    The other thing that bothers me, and perhaps I'll have to change this, is the fact that although this is MY blog, and my own personal space, I cant be completely honest here, nor can I divulge all the detals of my life.  You see, there are some people reading this blog who I am not entirely honest with.  That is not to say that I'm lying to them, but they just don't know ALL the situations in my life...and they can't, because that would cause some serious ruckus.  To me its better to revel in my own little happinesses and disappointments concerning those "unspoken situations" than to share them all, but beleive me I wish I could share them.  Its not that they'd make the blog any more thrilling, I just wish I had somewhere to record this all for reflection...I guess I'll have to save my personal "paper" journal for that.

       Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned   I think many of you hate me because I hate fat people.  You see, I don't really hate fat people.  I hate EVERYONE.  I am an equal opportunity hater and a super bitch with a wicked case of PMS....pay no mind to the girl behind the blog.  I watched Dawson's Creek the series finale and I weeped like a fucking little bitch.  What can I say, that corny teen melodrama shit really melts my icy heart.  I'm stoked that its Friday tomorrow 'cause I'm broke and money would be super right about now.   I've started reading a lot of blogs lately (not just the ones linked here) and you people are funny as hell and some of you are very interesting.    My cat's breath smells like cat food.

       Tax Dollars Hard at Work   I'm on hold on the phone with the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles.  So far I've heard the following delightful muzak tunes in between the pertinent clips of DMV info (most of which tells me just to go to their  urlLink website ): Cruisin' - Hewey Lewis & Gwenyth Paltrow In My Life - The Beatles Sunny Came Home - Shawn Culvin Some unknown piece of turd about an "All Time High" Another unknown but equally sucky tune "This is how most ouf our ladies grew up at the country club, dancing." I think its great to see that we're in a budget crisis here in my state, but at least we've got snazzy assed tunes on the DMV phone holding system.  Apparently the woman wants me to know that my call is important to them.  Meh, so answer the fucking phone already

       Eh...   Reloaded was pretty good.  A little over hyped and a slow assed start, but it fulfilled my expectations for the most part.  I think the woman who plays Trinity, Carrie Ann Moss, is THE most bad-assed, fucking rock your socks off, kick your ass and then spit on you, tough as nails hot chick EVER!  God she rules.  Freddy vs. Jason & Legally Blonde 2 trailers also rocked.  No Return of the King trailer though, that was disappointing.  Oh and they had a Terminator 3 trailer and a 2Fast 2 Furious (Fast & the Furious sequel) trailer.  What pieces of frozen bum piss and monkey shit are those movies?  Jesus fuckin christ, man!   urlLink Jack  offered me the following comments about the film early this morning: Iamtheyeti311: meh, i felt cheated Iamtheyeti311: lol Iamtheyeti311: now i know what a woman feels like after sex I AbsolutAngel I: lol Iamtheyeti311: like, "thats it."  All in all I give Matrix: Reloaded a 9 out of a possible 10 pink divarific stars.

       A Case of the Wednesday Blahs   I'm feeling very blah today.  I feel great because I got like 12 hours of sleep, but other than that I'm very out of sorts from my usual diva-self.  I also realized I have a HUGE project I have to work on here at my job, but as usual I'm procrastinating.  Somehow I got the brilliant idea to tell the project managers that I could have it done by May 27th.  Way to be, Gwen, way to be.  Acutally its very easy but its more me relying on others to get their information to me which is quite the task.  No one here likes to get anything done on time.  Alas, I sit here blogging to pass my time.    I'm also dreading my trip to the DMV on Thursday night after work.  Those people are a nightmare and I have to try and reactivate plates that were stolen 10 years ago but recovered shortly there after.  They're also vanity plates so it will cost me an arm and a leg to do it, but in the end it will make it much easier to find my car in the parking lot.  Also, I've put off my dieting and excercise until next week.  I'm super PMSy and miserable this week so I've decided to let my hormones be in charge rather than piss myself off any further.    Also, go check out  urlLink Anna's Blog .  She's punk rawk, a super hottie, she's got a "smokin' rack", she organizes B I T C H I N' shows, and just otherwise rules and is one of my bestest girlies.  You will love her, I promise!  That is all for now.  Oh yeah, get well soon, Patches!

       Diva Dating Service, Inc.      This is my friend Jamie.  He rules!  He's is 21 (he'll be 22 next week) and lives in Spokane, Washington (yes, the state).  He's 5'10, 240 and has the cutest hazel eyes and curly brown hair (he can grow it into a "TimboFro"!)  Jamie rocks the freaking heazy and he needs a super-awesome, really cool, neato, hottie-supafly girlfriend.  Help him out.  If you know anyone whos interested in his lil monkey ass hit him up with an  urlLink email  or leave a comment.    Anyhow, this is not a joke, I love Jamie dearly and he needs to get laid.  His last girlfriend was a megawhore cheating bitch and so he needs to do better.  And before you all start with your "Oh, Gwen, why don't  you  date him crap, we already dated, it didn't work out, but this kid is my BOY so I have to look out for him.    His musical tastes rock, he always cheers you up, he has a good sense of style, he's funny as all hell and he is gonna work at Walt Disney World soon!  So you should get in and hopefully get down with him in Florida!  He would be open to dating a girl at his school,  urlLink WSU  (go Cougs!), but they only wanna date basketball players or they're dirty who-ahs.  Right, so as I said, hook a brova up!   **Also: any other guys/girls looking for a date?? Send me a pic and a quick bio and I'll try and hook your ass up too!  I've made plenty of happy matches in my day...I just can't find the right one for me....so, um, I guess if you think you're the right guy/girl for me you can also email me with a picture and a short bio**

       I Am A Ranting, Insensitive Bitch   Okay, I don't care if you think I'm insensitve for what I'm about to say, and if you do feck you too!  This is a giant  FECK YOU!  to all the fat people here in my area who park in handicapped spaces when their only visible handicap is fat.  Fat is not a fecking handicap.  You are the people who SHOULD be parking further away because you could acutally use the excercise you huge, fat, gross mess!  I don't know what you're paying the idiots at the DMV to issue you that handicapped hang tag but you're taking valuable parking away from my grandmother, who is legitimately handicapped (she can barely see and has a hard time walking).  Similarly I am someone who could also use one of those hang tags.  I have Lyme Disease and when it starts to act up its extremely painful to be mobile because my hips and knees are so stiff, but I still must travel to the end of the parking lot and walk past your fat ass stuffing bags of ho-ho's and twinkies into your car like there was about to be a shortage of them.   You are the same people who get scooters at theme parks and casinos becuase you're too fecking fat to walk around, yet you're the first one to nearly run my ass over to get to the buffet line at the casino.  Honestly, why are you even bothering to go to Great Adventure or Disney World?  Your disgusitng, morbidly obese body wont fit into any of the ride cars.  Then you'll sue them because they're insensitive to your needs.  Unfortunately a panel of jurors will award you the cash to try and "stick it to the big corporations with all the money"....not realizing they're raising many of their prices to deal with the reprocussions of all of these frivolous law suits that morons like you are starting.  I hope you get taken out Mama Cass style.  Feck you, pigs.

       Mindless Mush   I had a really great weekend. I got to see a lot of people I don't normally hang out with which was great.  I took my mom out for Mother's Day.  We went into Manhattan and saw "Movin' Out", the Billy Joel musical.  It was actually really, REALLY good!  Then my brother treated her and I to Ruth's Chris steaks for dinner.  That was extremely yum.  It was so cute because at the end of the night she started crying and thanking us for "the best mother's day ever".  It was tres cute.    I'm thinking of getting an apartment about 20 mins away from where I live now with my best friend from high school.  I dunno how it will work out, but we're both employed full time and we've lived together before, so hopefully it wont be that bad.  Plus we would have the cutest, best, most awesome apartment.  Woo hoo to that.    I'm also stoked because I get to do a focus group.  Its like only an hour and its about facial cleansers and they're gonna pay me $50.  Suhweet!  She also told me she would keep me on the list and call me when she needed people.  W00t, w00tarini!  Oh, I also got new emo/ashleigh banfield glasses.  Yay!

       Random Friday Thought   I'd like to open a restaurant...2 restauruants acutally.  One would be all chicken skin (after all, any avid chicken eater knows the skin is the best part)  it would offer all various flavors of skin (garlic, butter, brown sugar, chive, dill, etc) I dunno what I'd call it though.  The second place would be called "Gwen's Feed Bag".  It would be a fast food restaurant serving things foil lined bags which include a mish mash of ingredients (similar to a Cornish Pastie...for my UK readers, only with out the yummy, flaky crust).  There would be all kinds of meals: chicken nuggets and fries, fried shirmp and veggies, different kinds of stews and other hearty meals.  It would make millions I say...millions.  My slogan would be "Come to Gwen's Feed Bag and Put your Face to the Sack".  Goddamn, I'm a marketing genius.

       I Can Never Watch T.V. Again   Ladies and gents, I can never watch T.V. again as long as I live for I have seen the pinnacle in perfect programming.  Leave it to those geniuses over at Fox to come up with  urlLink The Miss Dog Beauty Pageant .  Thats right, a beauty pageant for doggies.  It had a talent portion, and evening gowns.  Let me tell you, these were some SEXY bitches!    My personal favorite, Miss New York, a Jack Russell Terrier named Anastasia was eliminated from the K-9 and didn't make it to the final 5, but her talent was popping balloons so thats understandable.  Her emerald green gown was astonishing though.  Then of the final five I was torn between Disco, the golden retriever and Daisy the beagle and neither of them won (they placed in the bottom 2 of the final 5).  Of the top 2 choices there was a border collie (bleh) and a jack russell mix.  The JR mix climbed a ladder and walked a tightrope to rescue a cookiemonster baby!  All the border collie did was walk downstairs.  Alas the fickle judges made their decision and Sweet Pea, Miss Illinois was the first ever crowned "Miss Dog".    I will never watch anything else on tv as this was just literally untoppable, but I have gained new respect for Fox, and you bet your ass I will watch this next year.

       Warning: Rant Ahead   For some wierd reason I am in an EXTREMELY cranky mood. (Big surprise, right?)  Dear little Gwen, why are you so pissy?  Oh goodness, that is a loaded question: 1) Wheelchair guy is cooking some "food" in the microwave that smells like a loose taco stool, and he clipped his nails at work today and some flew on my desk  AND  he is sitting next to me SCREAMING on the phone in spanish.  Like anyone cares about what he has to say?  Lower your voice a) this is an office b) you're so OBVIOUSLY on a personal call.  2)  No cigarettes, coffee or junkfood is making me a mean, mean little girl.  3)  I still have this pesky SARS and I've run out of tissues at my desk so I'm having to tend to my nose with the cheap office paper towelling which is much more itchy and less friendly on my lil nose.  4) Nothing new has happened with my ecosphere...although it does look a little more green today.    5)  Its gloomy and raining today...I don't like it one bit.    6)  I have no money (and I just got paid last friday) and I didn't even adhere one iota to my "get outta debt" plan.  This lack of funds means no happy hour for me.  Le sigh.  7)  I miss Tina & Lisa...neither of them has been on AIM and thus I haven't spoken to either of them.    8)  I need a nap, desparately.

       EcoSphere Day 2   I did some studying on this last night and according to some ecosphere experts, in order for my tiny world to thrive it needs 6-8 hours of partial sunlight or flourescent light.  Lucky for me I'm a slave to the man and in this wacky world of papertrails the only lighting is flourescent, so I've relocated the ecosphere to sit directly under my flourescent desk lamp.  Maybe I should put some of my SARS infested snot into the mix, to jumpstart the "growth" in there.  Nah, thats too gross, even for me.    Anywhoo, todays observations: still the slight greenish algae tinge on the bottom, condesation in the top of the bottle.  Nothing of notable difference.

       All In The Name Of Science   I've never been big into science, but over dinner at the Outback this weekend with  urlLink ADYP  and  urlLink Lemon Fresh Jesus  the topic of those nifty  urlLink Brookstone "EcoSpheres"  came up.  We were all commenting on how neat it was and how we'd all like one, and of course ADYP had to bring up the buring question: "What if you jizzed into one?  Could you create a new master race of seamonkeys?"  Alas, I come into work this morning and there is a Litre of  urlLink Poland Spring  on my desk which has been there festering under the light for about 3 weeks to a month.  I'd only drank about a quarter of it before I forgot about it all together.  I notice there is some green algae starting to grow in the bottom of it.  Now, for the sake of science I will leave this bottle here and see if I have created life through a little saliva and a lot of forgotten, overpriced bottled water.  Perhaps I will create a race of small people who will in turn capture me, shrink me and make me their Goddess, like they did to little Lisa Simpson.  That could be neat.  I bet being a diety pays well.  So here it is, officially,  Day 1 of the Great Ecosphere Experiment  has gotten underway.  All I have to report is a thin layer of green algae.  I'll keep you posted with developments.

       A New Leaf?   I'm making yet ANOTHER half assed attempt to be a healthier person.  I have quit cold turkey soda, cigarettes, coffee and most junk food.  No more bacon, egg and cheese for breakfast, no more dunkin donuts.  I can do it, damn it.  (Please pardon my bitchiness should it crop up in the next few days weeks).  I'm walking a mile at the local high school track every day, I'm still doing my Pilates.  I started taking a multi-vitamin and vitamin C (in hopes that I can kick this pesky SARS).  I invite you all to place your bets now as to how long this lasts, maybe I'll send you a neat prize if you win.    Next month is my birthday, I will be 22.  I feel like I have no good milestone birthdays to look forward to anymore.  Can't I just stay 21 forever?  Maybe 25 'cause at least I can rent a car then.  I shouldn't be so outta shape and the teensy bit over weight that I am, so hopefully by end of teh summer I will be decent...just in time to pack on the winter weight.  Yay.  Lol.

Anyhow, big ups to  urlLink Boz  and  urlLink Kevynn  for putting this up for me to take.   The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Seventh Level of Hell!

To Tina I leave all my CPK, girlie 80's toys, powerpuff girl & sanrio stuff and my tilt jeans. To Lisa I leave all my shoes and chapsticks, Aidan and sordid secrets for good gossip later. To Lou I leave all my shitty pop music cds...do what them with you will, but I know the temptation to listen will over take you eventually. To Jon I leave my vibrators because as you once said (and I quote) "I can't compare". To Missy I leave my kitties and my martini shaker collection (complete with cool martini glasses). To Anna I leave my detective hats, feather boas and digicam so you can take awesome SG.com pics. To Petrina I leave my top-secret brownie recipe, my simpsons figure collection and my cat, Milo, so you can have Milo & Otis. To Michael I leave 25 million dollars so you can buy your downtrodden soul back from Whitey.  The rest of you can fight amongst yourselves for the piddly crap I have left (and if you find my furby, burn it)

One more still hangs in the balance and that crush is like not as strong as it was, men are  so  last week.    Man it feels good to be a gangsta.

       Post Birthday Hangover   I want to thank everyone who helped me celebrate my birthday this weekend as well as those of you who helped take care of me this weekend very late night on Saturday night, you know who you are and you are my dearest and best friends, although I was nothing but rotten to you and for that, I'm sorry.  I would like to share with you all a very important lesson that I learned this past weekend.  Friday night while out at Strike, Long Island for my birthday party with my "internet friends" I passed a comment about spending my actual birthday with my "real friends" (meaning the ones I'd known in the flesh my entire life).  However, it turns out that my internet freinds are better friends to me than my real ones and I want to thank you all for one of the best birthdays I've spent in a long time.  Similarly, I want to thank you all for the thoughtful presents and the company on Friday night.  It was a great time, honestly. (c:  I'm glad birthdays come but once a year, because I don't think I could handle the ups and downs of this past Saturday all the time.    To one person in particular: thank you for being you, thank you for being there from the highest of my highs to the lowest lows, and helping me pick up the pieces even after I've twisted the knife into your back.  One of these days I'll be a better person, I promise, I hope you're around to see it.  I love you more than you know...you know who you are (c:

       A Birthday Edition of Friday Five   i)  I am a  urlLink Cancer  and I fit every description thereof.  My next tattoo will be my astrological sign.  ii)  For the first time in 3 years I am having a birthday party and I have awesome loving friends with which to celebrate.  Similarly I do not have a boyfriend on my birthday for the first time in 6 years so maybe this is why I am actually gonna enjoy my birthday.  iii)  20 years ago on my birthday the Mianus River Bridge collapsed at 2 a.m.  iv)  I share my birthday with the likes of Gilda Radner, Mel Brooks, Pat Morita (yes, Mister Miyagi!), John Elway, Henry VIII, John Dillinger and John Cusak.  v)  Every year for my birthday I wish for a good boyfreind.  This year I've decided to stop wishing and hoping and have decided to wish for a year of fun times with my friends.  Oh yeah and since I forgot yesterdays thursday eyecandy, I'll give it to you today.  Its someone close to my heart and I know Aidan is only a character he plays, but he's still sexy....John Corbett:

       OUCH!   As it turns out,  urlLink Cheeks  is not the only one to injure his crotch this summer.  Either through running and weights at my  urlLink gym  or my pilates work out I have seriously pulled a muscle in my groin....AND IT REALLY FUCKING HURTS!  I can't wear pants, I can't really walk, I can't sit indian style and stairs are MISERABLE to navigate.   Owies!  (Will someone come massage it for me?)  Furthermore, I finally got around to watching the first episode of the new season of  urlLink Sex and the City  last night.  It was heart wrenching, at least to me, becuase well...Aidian, who in my mind is the perfect man and also represents the one that got away within my own life, is MARRIED and has a BABY.  I thought I was going to puke when I saw it, literally.  It was such a shot to the gut.  Its amazing how a show like that can make you want to slit your wrists because it can so painfully and acurately dredge up all those emotions about failed relationships that you hide from everyone else.  Definitley an A+, very good, girlie show.  2 more days to my birthday!  Yay yay yay!  (I know, I know you're ALL sick of hearing about it, but fear not the insanity will be over shortly!)

       I'm So Proud of...Me!   Yesterday I went back to the gym for the first time and I rocked ass!  I did a seriously brisk walk for 1 mile, I did my whole old weight regimen AND I swam 1/2 a mile.  When I came home I chatted online for a bit and then did my 20 minute pilates work out as well!  Honestly I am feeling G R E A T today and hopefully I'll be looking slimmer before I know it.  They gym was hard work, but I know it will be worth it.  I'm just hoping I actually stick with it this time.  The bane of my existance is the fact that I am quite possibly the laziest human being alive.  Ask Jon, he used to be my gym partner.    This is gonna be my year though, finally at 22 I  WILL  get my act together.  I've started reading a book at least one a week, I've started working out again, I'm being more social, my room has been clean for over 2 weeks, I will get out of debt and I will move out on my own.  Its a full plate, but deep down I know I can do it.  I guess the only way to combat laziness is to get up off your couch potato ass and do something!  4 more days til my birthday and little did I know that  urlLink Mister Malone  is also a June baby...his birthday is tomorrow.    All this energy and I'm not even 1/4 through my coffee....scary.

Its a new year for us starting now and we're gonna make 'em all regret the crap they've started.  I wish you nothing but rainbows and sunshine and cupcakes today (cause I'm *that* girlie!), I hope your birthday rocks your socks off and finally makes you smile!  Hugs & Smooches!

       The Friday Five   i) If you wouldn't say something to someone's face, you shouldn't say it in your blog or you'll catch all holy hell.  ii) Boys with lip rings may not be all knowing, but they are certainly good for making you forget your troubles for a while. (c:  iii)  urlLink Patches  cards make anyone smile!  iv) When you've had enough of stupid men and are totally aggrivated the cure is a night out at bar9 with all your  urlLink girls  and some yummy appletinis.  v)  It takes a long time to get mail from Hong Kong, especially when you're waiting for your birthday present to yourself to arrive.  (Btw:  8  days til my birthday, and  3  til Anna's!)

       Apologies   I think my estrogen level is scaring people away.  I haven't had a period in almost 2 years and now I've started to get it again and my emotions are hair-trigger and lean towards hating all things with XY chromasome makeup.  My apologies, I don't really hate ALL boys, I just want some good old fashioned lovin'  (and not necessarily even in the naughty way).  I think I need a girlie night out to drown my sorrows and share my triumphs over an apple martini or two with  urlLink Anna ,  urlLink Missy , and  urlLink Lisa .

       Another Overly Dramatic Weekend   When you feel the need to get hopped up on coke and beat your chick (your chick who  happens  to be my best fucking friend) don't think I'm gonna let you get away with it.  Furthermore, don't think I'm not gonna call you out for being a scumbag and a pussy.  Why don't you try and get custody of your fucking pigfaced child before you try and lure another potential wife into the mix who will probably just leave you because of your "temper" like the first one.   If you have to beat a girl to feel better about yourself, espeically a girl you supposedly love, you're not a man, not even being able to bench 295 lbs. can make you more manly.    If you put your hands on me again or even so much as look at me the wrong way, I will blow up your spot, and you  WILL  go to jail.  I already sent one guy there, so believe me I'm not scared of you, especially since the only emotion I'm tied to you by is hate.  You make me sick.  Go steal some more money from my friend and put it up your nose you disgusting piece of shit!  On the  happier  side of this weekend.  I have the best mommy and friends in the universe.  Thank you to  urlLink Tazz  &  urlLink Anna  for helping me realize I'm doing the right thing here.  You guys are  too  good to me (c:  My mom and I went all over the place this weekend: awesome Super Stop & Shop, Stew Leonards, Walmart, manicures & pedicures and a lunchy all to ourselves.    And finally here comes the updated  Birthday Countdown!  One week til Anna's Birthday!  Wooooo! 12 Days til my birthday.  Wooo!  Oh yeah, Anna and I expect presents.  We're not gold diggers or anything, but we're cute and we've given you some lovely bloggy goodness (c:

       The Friday Five   i) When you yell anti-American sentiments aloud and then try to offer  urlLink Anna  a donut, she'll tell you "I don't want your hate pastries!"  (God, that girl is funny!)  ii)   urlLink Tazz  gets confuddled when he gets into his car and hears "La Cucaracha".  iii)  There are more animals  outside  of the Bronx Zoo, than there actually are inside (Can I get a ringing of the inapropriate bell??)  Furthermore the Cocanya rat is a new breed that Anna and I have renamed, as its old nomenclature (the "Mouse-like Hamster") was just half assed.  iv)  I have a  H U G E  crush on someone who is a smartass and knows it 'cause he reads my blog, lol.  v)  More people need to  BUY   urlLink Digger Phelps ...they're good, you wont regret it!  **Management apologizes for the shittiness of this Friday Five, but well, this wasn't a really educational week.  My bad!**

       Good For A Laugh   Last night, the infamous dirtbag, Joe, called me whilst I was out at Sidewalk Cafe with my friends.  I harassed him, mocked him and basically belittled him to no end.  I asked him if he was itchy, or if he had any new rashes.  He didn't like that too much.  Finally at like 12:30a.m. he calls back and the following conversation ensues: J: "So, uh are you seeing anyone?" Me: "Maybe...are YOU seeing anyone?" J: "Yeah I'm talking to someone" (for anyone outside of the North East area not hip to the lingo "talking to" means making out and hooking up, but no official commitment as of yet, but generally you don't "talk" to more than one person at a time).  "So, I was wondering if maybe we could hang out this weekend...you know, I could come up to CT or something" Me: "Well I'm busy Friday and Saturday" J: "What about sunday?" Me: "I dunno, I usually sleep then, maybe another time." J: "Well I really miss you, Gwen.  I can't stop thinking of you and I REALLY want to see you." Me: "Well what would this chick you're talking to think of that?" J: "I'm not talking to anyone...its no big deal we're not together.  God, why do you have to be so angry and standoffish all the time" Me: "Thats another lie right there!  Its too late for this.  I'm sick of being lied to and clowned.  Bye." (click)  A little while later I get a text message that reads as follows "GWEN I MISS YOU DON'T BE ANGRY".  He's such a fucking bo-tard scumbag.  I think I might change my cell number so I don't have to listen to his lies anymore.  Oooh maybe for my birthday someone will buy me a pitchfork & shovel to get rid of some of the bullshit in my life.  That would be swell.  I'm not angry though, I'm still happy, cheery, shiny Gwen.  Yay yay yay!

       What Did I Learn Today?   I learned that having never run a day in your life and having just quit smoking a lil while ago, that it is absolutely, unequivocally unrealistic to expect to RUN 1 mile in the morning.  However I do have a lovely neighborhood to take a brisk walk in, so I did that.  Hopefully I will build up to running.  Any runners have any suggestions on how to "build up to it"?

       Weekend Update    Oh my freaking God, I don't even know where to start with this weekend.  I was awake from 6:15 am Friday morning until 3:00am Sunday Morning.  Needless to say none of these recaps apply to Sunday as I was asleep the entire day but here is what I can remember from this weekend:  Porn star Cali Xavier lives in my town, right near me. I met someone who stabbed someone and will be doing a stint in jail for 2+ yrs because of it...great... The weekend was filled with many ex-boyfriends and much cock blocking. You can't really call it a cock block when the offending c-blocker is the person's significant other. Quoth the T$: "Froddo Baggins is all over the fucking place" (I don't get it either) The Bronx Zoo rocks your socks off even when its really wet. Elephants really do need to be scratched.  urlLink Jon ,  urlLink Gwen , urlLink Anna , &  urlLink Sheepster  in the Skyfari = one massive neurotic panic attack.  urlLink Stew Leonards  is the Happiest Place on earth.  urlLink Meow TV  is quality feline entertainment. It is entirely possible for 2 smallish girls under 5'4, to consume an entire bottle of Courvassier in one night. Its not clam shell or crab shanti: its the fucking crab shell! The skank factor was in full effect. Stan has not accepted his undeniable likeness to craig kilbourn or the hotness it entails.  urlLink The Mouse-Like Hamster  has been renamed the Cocanya Rat by  urlLink Anna  and I. I think for now thats all I can remember, but it was good times...good times indeed.  I'll add more as it comes to me. **I just remembered: the Zoo Crew discovered that "w00t", while acceptable to say in an IM conversation is not acceptable to utter outloud in real life, cause it just sounds silly.**

       The Friday Five   Its that time of the week again, time for the Friday five:  1)  Some people (not just the X-Factor) have no concept of hygene or the common courtesy to think other people might care that they have to smell your reeking ass.  (Sales guys at EB in the Pallisades center, I'm looking in your direction).  2)  Picking on New Jersey leads to a slew of commenty backlash.  Apologies are in order to  urlLink Lisa ,  urlLink Michael (Not Mike) ,  urlLink Petrina  and  urlLink Patches .  It was just a good natured ribbing.  I mean look at me I'm from CT (Picture Wayne & Garth in front of a CT post card saying "we're in CT...it uh...connects better states").  3)  Even if you're a girl who generally sucks at video games, its possible for one of them to take over your life.  ::cough::Zelda::cough::  4)  Tis the season to hit up the  urlLink zoo .  Not only am I taking a field trip with all of my fine feathered blogging friends to the Bronx zoo tomorrow, but  urlLink Mo  also had a zoo adventure this week.  She rules, go read her blog, damn it!  5)  June babies are the best.   urlLink Anna's  b-day is in 17 days,  urlLink Boz's  bday is in 6 days, and my divalicious day of birth is in 22 days.  Put on your party hats, mother bitches.  We expect blog mention on our big days!

       Weird Day   Its 11:50 a.m. eastern standard time and I have just arrived at work.  I should have been here at 8 am, but just before 6 there was an explosion and a fire underground in a manhole which knocked out the power to over half of my town.  I plan on doing nothing in the four hours that I am here.  Its very weird to be with out power.  We had no phone, no hot water, no tv, no computer, no internet, no videogames, no radio, nothing.  We were entirely shut off from the world.  It was so crazy.   Power is back on and I'm here at work again, but no one is here.  We might get a REALLY cute puppy though.  I'll keep y'all posted about that.  Eeeeeee!

       No More Zelda Before Bed   I can't continue playing Zelda before my bedtime.  Last night I had a series of bizzare dreams based on various facets of the  urlLink Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker  game.  In one part I was swimming in the ocean and by doing different whistles I could control the direction that the waves would push me.  I was trying to get to shore, but I had to do all these random tasks before the native peoples (who turned out to be Japanese) would let me ashore.    The dream continued further when I acutally did come ashore I had to wander around Tokyo collecting various items.  There was a black boy around my age there who smelled really nice.  I found out it was becuase he kept cocobutter from the  urlLink The Body Shop  on hand and was constantly applying it so he didn't get ashy.  Then  urlLink Jeff  was there as well as Patrick and Arelis and we were looking for a place to go smoke the pot I found.  We went to some wierd kareoke bar/restaurant where all of my personal belongings were waiting in a suitcase.  The matire'd approached us asking if we liked Mrs. Robinson...Patrick said yes and they brought us a tv with this wierd kareoke song playing and the video was of some little old lady in a house coat scaling the side of a mountain.  WTF?  I woke up and went back to sleep.  I was in the  urlLink Food Emporium  thats by my job and I found my flute in the milk section, so I started playing various little songs on it.  One of them was a water song and all of thse water falls started falling from the ceiling and the lighting went all blue and all these hella cool fountains showed up.  I swam around some more, it was very refreshing.  Mary W. the auditor from my job was there and she was thanking me for allowing her to have reasonably priced hydrotherapy, so she gave me a small orb, I took the orb to this really elaborate fountain in the back and the water turned to strawberry milk....I floated around and drank it for a bit.  Then I woke up.  Alas heres a quick math lesson for you PaxilCr + Zelda + bedtime = seriously wacky assed dreams.

       Random Thoughts   1.  Come play with me on  urlLink Friendster ...I need to have the most friends!  2.  I bought a game cube over the weekend as an early birthday present for my divalicious self.  Its purple and it came with 2 free games.  Super Mario Sunshine and Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker.  Wind waker is crack.  I have done nothing but play that game since I got it.  I'm not very far, but its so addictive.  I spent 5 solid hours playing it last night....what the hell!??!  Oh yeah and its purple which is pretty!  3. I am in a REALLY great mood today.  I'm not sure why, but I am....so I'm giving you all a gigantic CYBER HUG & KISS!  ((Everyone!)) *c: (MwAh!)

       Weird Dream #2,975,698   Last night I dreamt I was with  urlLink Petrina  in her car with les kitties headed to  urlLink Whitey's  house.  We ended up gettign there, but it wasn't a house it was an overcrowded  urlLink Starbucks  and everyone was getting uppity because there was only one person working there.  I got behind the counter and started making lattes like I hadn't left my management position there 3 years ago.    All of a sudden we were running around in a field and one of Petrina's cats was being attached by a vampire.  Note to self: don't watch The Lost Boys right before bedtime....its not gonna end well.

Way back on May 28th, I pledged to myself that I wouldn't have a boyfriend or get involved in a relationship for 2 months.  I did it.

       Angry Politically Incorrect Rant For The Day   I fucking hate it when I go somewhere and people are being waited on in Spanish.  Hello, did you get the memo that this is America and in America we speak ENGLISH!  What's our national language again: oh yeah, thats right....ENGLISH!  Maybe they didn't tell you that when you jumped the border or your raft washed ashore, but here in America we speak English, not Spanish when getting a public service or while out dealing with the public.  I wouldn't go to Mexico, Guatemala, Columbia or wherever else you migth be from and be ballsy enough to  expect  the person I'm speaking to to speak english with me when clearly its not the national language.  I don't care if you English is barely comprehensible, at least you're TRYING to speak the language, and with practice it will get better, but this is not your country, and you left said country for a reason so get used to how it is here....Rar!  **Yes, I am really this insensitive...**  Also I want to welcome  urlLink Gary  to the blogging community (his link is also in the sidebar) and he buys me kick ass birthday presents!  Also I'm really getting into  urlLink Blu's  blog.  I've seen her comment's on Boz's site forever and just never got around to reading it, but I'm loving it (so she's in the linkbar now too!).

Don't want to lose my old comments (cause some rocked) but EN has been sucking a lot lately.  Halsocan are the first set of comments now on the bloggeroo so comment away!

       Kick The Sandman In The Sack   Well my paxil has finally and completely fucked me over.  The insomnia listed as one of its bastard side effects has finally kicked in.  Last night I tried to go to bed at 10 pm, because I legitimately felt tired, however, paxil decided that for my body, this wasn't going to happen until  3 fucking AM this morning  when I had to be up at 6:15 to get ready for work.  The sleep I got was decent and I'm not  that  tired this morning, but I know if this keeps up all week its gonna get bad.  Furthermore, not being able to fall asleep stresses me out and makes me feel pressured and I start gettign all panicky, which is exactly what the paxil is supposed to prevent.  No sir, I don't like it.  All you late night IM-ers might have a new buddy though if this keeps up.  Feh!  Oh yeah and as for the  urlLink "Boz's Labor Day Weightloss Challenge"  I, much like  urlLink Anna , have lost 4 lbs already.   Only 16 more to go.  Think I can do it?  We'll see!

       Man It Feels Good To Be A Gangsta   Last night was AWESOME.  I went to a party in Shaolin (Staten Island, What what!) with  urlLink Missy ,  urlLink Anna  & Ashley, for  urlLink Jeff's  friend's birthday.  It was fun mostly cause there was this yummy red drink that snuck up on you, there was some decent eye candy and because  we  were the girls that all the guys wanted to talk to and all the girls could only just talk about.  We were the hot, bitchy girls who no one knew (and normally who I hate) and it never felt better.  I love my girlies.  I can't wait to do it again in Boston!

       Another Wierd Dream   Last night I had another wierd dream.  I was in a  urlLink Stew Leonard's-esque  grocery store when Arnold Schwarzennager walks in and this guy I know,  urlLink Rich , walks up to him and starts kissing his ass so hard, I was like embarassed to be there.  Anyhow, Arnold walks out and we all stand around talking about it.  Then he walks back in in his Terminator leather jacket and opens fire on everyone with a street sweeper.    I grab my friend Ashley's hand and we start running and climbing through offices and out of windows scaling down all of these terraces and balconies.  We get on the ground and start running but we're too slow to out run him, so I show her how to fly (drugs are bad, mmm kay?) and we are like running and flying and jumping off all these cliffs.  We get to somewhere we think is safe to hide and there are all these evil cult girls (like Rose McGowan from Jawbreaker) who want to cut our thumbs and take our blood so they can make us evil and we wont be able to be killed by Arnold.    I don't like this 'cause we'd still be evil, but they start talking to Ashley about how she looks like a soccer player and she starts to fall for the trap and I save her and we jump off a cliff and then I woke up.  I kinda wanna know how it ends though.  I think ultimately I am  less  upset that I was trying to be killed by Arnold, and more upset that I was dreaming of Rich.

       Weekend Recap   Another weekend gone by, another great time had by all involved.  It started Thursday night at my friend John's happy hour party.  Lots of friends from high school showed up and we danced and drank into the night.  I woke up at 4 a.m. feeling like the budweiser clydesdales were riverdancing across my head, tylenol fixed that and I worked my lil bummy off.    Friday I went out for drinks at a bar called Barcelona with an unnamed someone.  Details on this someone will come later, but I don't want to jinx anything.  I collected Ashley from the scumbag's house and we wen't BACK to Thirsty Turtle for some good old fashioned drinking and bar dancing.  The "someone" (S.O.) from Barcelona showed up with his friend in tow and we hung out after Ashley left me stranded at the bar.  Me, soemone and his friend went to Davey Burns (a bar which is as much a Greenwich High School reunion as it is anything else) and ate some fries and rode of into the early minutes of the 3 am hour.  It was a really nice night.  I got home to get a phone call from SO to say good night and slept away.  Saturday:  wake up, go to Stew Leonard's with my mommy, came home and hit up the gym and then back over to Ashley's where we pregamed before hitting up turtle.  Met this totally awesome girl called Carrie from upstate New York, totally sweet and her friends were rockin' too, so it turned it to one girly estrogen fest complete with girlie shots and grabbing of boy's bums.  Bob and John showed up at Turtle in the midst of one of our shows on the bar and we hung with them for a bit, they're very chill dudes.  We went to Playland and hung with some rent-a-cops who were drinking Mike's hard lemonade and then back to Davey Burns where we left after 5 minutes.  It was awful.    Sunday was my mommy's birthday so I pampered her and took extra good care of her and it ended with a super yummy hibachi dinner at Abis.  Yum Yum!    I think I'm a little "turtled-out" for now, but I won a free happy hour party from there for 25 people, so I guess one more night out there won't hurt, right?  I wish I could gush a little bit more about SO, but its a little early to have anythign to write about and I'm not sure who is reading this.  I don't care if he sees it, but I don't need all these other G'wich people up in my bidness.  Anyhow I promise to start blogging more frequently and I will start catching up on reading you all and commenting, as I've been quite remiss about it since July started.  Take care, lovies!

       Friday Five (For Real)    1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?   It was a girl called Johanna Cheslock in Nursery School.  She and I used to play Scooby Doo in the pool.  She was always Velma and I was Daphne   2. Are you still in touch with this person?   No, because she moved and we met up again in High School, but were too different.  She became best friends with my current best friend, and in an odd twist of events I saw her last night for the first time in 6 yrs at a bar.   3. Do you have a current close friend?   Of course, I have several...they know who they are (c:   4. How did you become friends with this person?   Some through high school and middle school, some through the internet.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?   My other best freind from nursery school, Jesse Kovacs, because I heard he got into some trouble with drugs and I would like to try and help him, and no one makes a better ice cream sundae or plays G.I. Joes so fun as him.

       Back for Now    God everything is insanely crazy here at work, which is where I do most of my blogging since I have issues blogging from my previous and my brother's PC was being commandeered by our house guest.  I have, however, found a quiet moment so I decided I'd write.  I've got nothing of real significance to say, as I've been in one of my "I ran out of paxil on Friday and its now days later and I'm sickies" funks, but I have my paxil and I'm feeling much better.    I am trying to get motivated to get my butt to the gym and actually USE the membership I'm paying for (my paxil-less funks leave me nauseous and winy in bed which makes it hard to do anything else)  Next week I will be starting a new eating plan (mostly Japanese cuisine like sushi and rice) and salads and water only.  Of course I will be able to have a few snackies here and there, but I'm really gonna try hard to lose weight with  urlLink Boz  and the others who are working on it.    I also want to say thank you to  urlLink Lou  &  urlLink Lisa  for the wonderful birthday & Disney pressies and to Lisa for cheering me up over a sushi dinner, it was wonderful and I absolutely adore you and your company! (c:  I wish I had something witty or entertaining to write, but its the middle of the week during my busy season at work...always a quiet time.  Take care my lovely bloggy neighbours.  I'll catch ya on the flipside!

       As American as Sand In Your Asscrack   Wow, my poor little bloggy poo, I have neglected you so much as its been quite a busy time here at work lately, but I will sneak in this time to show some love.    I had an absolutely  amazing  weekend.  I got to spend time with ALL of my friends, which really ruled.  Thursday night out at Thirsty Turtle was filled with some really great times with my friends from highschool, some of whom I haven't seen since the summer after graduation, and now most of them have graduated college.  I danced with the upper classmen from varsity football team who wouldn't have (and didn't) give me the time of day in high school and I laughed in their faces and got away with openly mocking them and they were none the wiser.  It was oddly (and in some ways pathetically) empowering.  I think its safe to say they've all jumped the goddamned shark.  Friday: suare at Chez  urlLink Anna  and the  urlLink RF Babies  Mansion.  Anna has a very deck deck.  We swam, we drank frozen appletinis, we saw some fireworks, Anna's house was almost blown up, I got to spend time with my wonderful hubby,  urlLink Patches  (who makes an awesome cd!), the  urlLink Doogster  came out and partied and  urlLink Maria  and I made a whirlpool with everyone in the pool.    Saturday I cooked this delicious orzo with summer vegetable salad to enjoy with my family at our barbeque.  My cookies however, were not so successful, but eh, we'll survive with out all the fat.  Saturday night I went to my friend Megan's house who has a bitchin pool and a waterslide!  (yes, a W A T E R S L I D E !) it ruled.  We chilled, we drank some beers and the new frozen  urlLink Arbor Mist  drinks which were yum.    Finally around 2 am I called it a night only to wake up at 9 the next morning to go to Jones Beach in Long Island with all my girlies.  It was sunny, warm, a perfect day for reading and listening to jazz on the beach.  We got thrown in the ocean, got sand in our bums, but it was absolutely delightful.    :::le sigh::: I can not imagine a more perfect weekend.  (c:  Hope all of you had as great a time as I did.  <3

       I Salute Connecticuts Finest   At my job I have to read through police reports and decided whether or not the violation is false or not depending on the description here is an excerpt from one of those logs:  18:32  33 Riversville Road - Glenville Elementary School:  Building checked and secure, key holder, stacy romain related that a hamster is missing somehwere in the bldg and may have set off motion detector  21:17  33 Riversville Road - Glenville Elementary School: The bldg was checked, but the  rogue hamster was able to evade capture at this time.   God, Im proud of our police force.  This is an actual report turned in by an acutal police officer.  No wonder half of the fuckups from my graduating class are now on the police force.

       Ugh   It is now 1:15pm and I am DREADING the impending arrival of Dean, my project manager.  Dean is a retired engineer and he means well he but has the annoying habbit of creating all of these theoretical situations and then says "well i know it doesn't matter but what if..."  Well, Dean, if it doesn't matter why are you even wasting my time with it, ass?  Dean is bringing with him, Bob, the other project manager.  This isn't even a real project but they're kicking all of these hypothetical and utterly impossible situations around becuase people in my town are lawsuit happy.  I appreciate they're trying to cover their ass, but they're overlooking the most basic aspects of the project in attempts to cover said ass.  I wish I never got assigned to this project.

       Trouble   My mom is really upset and not talking to me because she found out that I signed for Ashley's car.  She is really, really pissed and yelling and she is saying that I'm not allowed to hang out with Ashley anymore.  I'm 22 so she can't really do that, but she made an excellent point: I have been there for Ashley through EVERYTHING and she juts keeps fucking me over.  She's not my friend.

       Yay!   Today is a really great day at work for me.  Not only is it the Friday before a long weekend, but I came to work today to find the following email from the Comptroller, my department head: "Gwen, With your upcoming involvement in the Budgeting and Accounting processes we are  transferring your function and direct reporting  from Joyce to Mary.  This will be effective September 1, 2003."  Now, when this happened to my friend Anthony (transfer of function) he became a financial analyst.  From how it is explained to me I am to be doing the exact same thing as Anthony, I will be supporting the Budget Driector and the Chief Accountant.  This is really exciting for me becuase while its not been expressly stated the transfer from Administrative Staff Assistant to Financial Analyst means a change in unions as well as a pay increase to put me on the same level as Anthony.  Knowing that its a unionized environment I am not gonna hold my breath waiting for the raise, but Financial Analyst looks much better on a resume than Administrative Assistant.  I am SO excited.  Not to metnion the fact that Mary is much more amicable and agreeable and far less nosy than Joyce.  Wooo woooo wooooooo!

       A Little of This, A Little of That   *~*"Sometimes you get shown the light in the strangest of places, if you look at it right" - J. Garcia*~*  Lots of goings on, but nothing really to write about....  The summer is rapidly winding down, school starts Tuesday and work just keeps on keepin' on.  I have to say though, this has been one of the Best Summers I've had in a LONG time.  From the  urlLink Boston trip , to the Strike Long Island Party,  urlLink Anna's  4th of July party,  urlLink Doogie's  softball game, the Bronx Zoo trip, nights out in the city, random keggers in Shaolin where we tried to fight really big dudes, the Blow Job room at Bar 9, Silent Film Score shows, Bon Jovi Concerts with  urlLink Tazz , trips to Jones Beach, nights out at bars, my birthday, Anna's birthday, God, such great times.  I love all of you who were there to share in it (even if I couldn't figure out how to work in a link to ya!).  You're all truly amazing people and I'm both proud and lucky to call y'all friends.    Okay enough of the mushy, smooshy crap...I'm just in a really great mood.  I dunno why, well, I DO know why (but thats none of your bizniss!).  I think we all need to get together and find a really great way to "Officially" close out the summer, or at very least get crackin' on our Halloween plans or perhaps a weekend in Montreal.  Don't worry, all you underagers can come too.  Montreal is a veritable mecca for the 18+ crowd, legal drinking, gambling, amazing nightlife, the American dollar goes pretty far there and its only a short jaunt across the border.  What do we say, eh?  Oh and I know its not over yet, but  urlLink Boz  totally kicked ass in his Labor Day Weightloss Challenge.  And while we're talking about the other crazy cats in the "Magical Land of Blog" I have to say, I really miss  urlLink Mo .    Thats all she wrote....

       A Few Entirely Random Post Lunchies Thoughts...    urlLink This song totally rocks and I can't get it out of my head nor can I stop listening to it over and over and over again.    The whole cd is pretty good, acutally, but this one is just so darn catchy.  I am quite happy as I just got an extremely "yay" package in the mail from  urlLink Sephora  I think I might apply for a jobby there during the holiday season just for a bitchin' discount.   My face hurts because I can't stop smiling or thinking about you and I am so excited to see you tomorrow and I just wanted to thank you for the billionth time for reminding me how great it is when you're giddy like a little five year old.  :)   urlLink Trace Element  will be playing Thursday October 23, 2003 at the  urlLink The Thirsty Turtle  in Stamford.  Happy hour and rockin' eye candy?  You all better be there!

       I Stink!   In posting about  urlLink bands , I completely forgot to mention  urlLink Digger Phelps  (the band, not the guy).  Its probably becuase of my secret subconcious vendetta against  urlLink Whitey  and his  urlLink band .  Nah, I dont really hate you, I just am a forgetful young Gwen sometimes.

       Weekend Recap   Friday:  I had a horrible and otherwise awfully boring day at work.  This was counteracted by a really stellar night out for some dinner at  urlLink Stir Crazy  followed by some rocking skee ball action at  urlLink Dave & Busters .  I also won a grover doll which is SO cute and I discovered I have enough tickets to win the television and the Atari.  Yes, the old skool awesome 1980's atari.  I want that mother!  It all was capped off by some innocent smooching in the parking lot with a very cute boy. (c:  Saturday: Yard work (feh!) with my mommy and then some shopping and some napping.  Then I headed down into the city with the Dapper Don,  urlLink Jon  and  urlLink Anna  for some yummy munchies at  urlLink Monster Sushi .  I will leave out the part how Jon, Don & I got lost in the 'hood of Brooklyn (BK, holla!).  Manhattan traffic sucks balls especially down by the Ferry.  Sunday: Much needed sleep, Megan's Birthday BBQ and some good old fashioned Carrie time on Sex In the City.  I am pooped right now and looking forward to hittin' the proverbial hay, but I have a feeling I'm gonna be up for a bit.  Why are weekends so short?!?!

       Sleeping to Dream   **No, these aren't about ANYBODY, so chill out, they're just awesome lyrics to amazing songs by Jason Mraz...fuck the remedy, go check out the rest of his stuff, he's phenomenal**  I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town I'm counting my sheep and each one that passes is another dream to ashes  and they all fall down. As I lay me down tonight,  I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight I'm sleeping to dream about you  I'm so tired of having to live without you  So I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired I found myself in the riches (Your eyes, your lips, your hair.) Well you were everywhere But I woke up in the ditches. I hit the light and I thought you might be here  but you were nowhere. You were nowhere at home. As I lay me back to sleep  Lord I pray that I can keep Sleeping to dream about you  I'm so tired of having to live without you  So I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired (It's just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night.) Sleeping to dream about you  I'm so tired of having to live without you  So I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired - j. mraz

       R - i - i - i - i - ght (Alternate Title: Drugs Are Bad, Mmmkay?)   My ex boyfriend is a complete and utter bo-tard.  He's still really drugged up, he's still moving furniture and thinks that somehow a little fairy will flitter down and come and make him a rockstar.  (Good luck with that, idiot.)  Apparently within the last couple of days he has had a run-in with God.  This was such a big deal that he had to call me and tell me about it and how its a "sign" that we should get back together.  When he and I were dating our anniversary was 02.22.02.  Apparently Thursday night he was having a rough night, the drugs weren't being so kind to him and he was feeling like the failure he is.  He went to the ATM to withdrawl money, his balance was $22.02.  He went to the counter, bought his pack of Marlboro red's and headed home.  On his way home (and I recall all of this based on his telling it to me last night) he asked God to send him someone who would help him and a sign that he wasn't completely alone and doomed to fail.  He goes upstairs, smokes a joint and picks up his sister's cell phone.  He scrolls through her phone book and my name (and new cell # he didn't have) show up at #22.  According to my simple-minded ex, it was "fate" that "our numbers" kept popping up everywhere so he had to call me and try and get back together with me.  I have also been informed that if I deny that we should get back together that I am lying to myself.    Apparently he's unaware of the fact that a) he choked me and threatened to cut and burn me b) accused me of stealing 2 grand from him and c) cheated on me twice (once with his  ex with herpes  who he later found out he had gotten pregnant, but he swears they used protection).  Apparently now though, even though she's terminated her pregnancy, he realizes sex is no joke and "hasn't been with anyone since me", except for that girl who his sister told me he was sleeping with in the HALLWAY OF THEIR APARTMENT! (Classy!).  I told him to get bent and not call my house anymore.  Why is my life filled with retards?

       You & I Both   Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me Oh things are gonna happen naturally And taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side  And balancing the whole thing But often times those words get tangled up in lines And the bright lights turn to night Until the dawn it brings A little bird who'll sing about the magic that was you and me Cause you and I both loved What you and I spoke of What you and I spoke of Others only dream of the love that I love See I'm all about them words Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive Now you and I, you and I Not so little you and I anymore And with this silence brings a moral story  more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see now well I'm already finally out of and it's okay if you have go away just remember the telephone works both ways and if I never ever hear it ring if nothing else I'll think the bells inside  have finally found you someone else and that's okay cause I'll remember everything you sang you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see now well I'm already finally out of words. - j. mraz

       Cease Fire   I dont know how everything got so out of hand with everyone.  I don't know when we became the people we hate.  I don't know when or how or why we split off from a community where factions were being formed and chaos was pitting people against each other just to form a new, smaller one which has broken down more rapidly.  I say that I dont like drama, yet I often find myself awash in a sea of it.  I have a tendency to care too much about what people will think about me so I take to a group mentality.  Thats wrong, I am a free thinking, intelligent individual and I am capable of thinking for myself.  I know I don't have to like everyone and I know not everyone has to like me.  I'm not a bad person at the core, but I've become very ugly on the inside.  Its fun having close friends and I love them dearly, but I've also made some quick personality judgements becuase of it.    I know I am gonna catch hell and mockings from some people for this, but I dont care, if you were a good person you would respect me for being an adult and for recognizing my mistakes.  I would like to offer an apology to several people: Liz, Matt, Maria, Amy, Joe and I'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting: I am sorry for not taking the time to get to know you before I judged you and I'm sorry that I may have treated you harshly out of going with the group.  I'm sorry that I let what other people had to say influence how I treated you.  That was wrong and I know an apology is too little and often times too late, but I hope you will at least recognize this as an extension of an olive branch.  I'm not asking that we become best friends nor am I asking that you even try and give me the time of day, thats entirely up to you, but I hope you will at least realize that I am sorry for how I treated you in the past.  That was petty, childish and othewise wrong.  The pot shots that were taken are not "my style" and I'm embarassed for that, alot of what I know (or rather don't know) about you is all based on things others have said, and really, who am I (who is anyone) to judge someone else.    To my friends and others with whom I am NOT fighting.  I hope you won't hold this against me.  This is all getting very petty though, and its not fun anymore when we have to walk on eggshells.  I'm not saying I want to be best friends with everyone, nor do I expect all of us to get along and hang out, but I hope you will all start to realize the path we were collectively headed down is wrong.  I want this to continue to be as fun as it was, like back in the Hard Rock Farewell party, that was a fun time.  We're all adults so lets take one anothers hand and all climb out of the sandbox.  I love you all, but I can't stand the fighting.  Its really starting to get to me.  I am blaming no one and I hope you will all see that, I just need to take some time away and "unplug" to sort myself out.  I'm not expecting everyone to get together and sing and be happy, but I do hope some of these rifts can be mended as truly, there is no need for them in the first place.  If we all got to know one another before making these cursory assesments of character we'd all be a lot better off.  Who knows, we could be missing out on knowing some really great people.  I am in no way resigning from the babies board or this blog nor am I calling anyone out on anything.  I just felt I needed to get thsi all off my chest.

       On Life...   Right now I feel as though I'm on the verge of an era of civil unrest.  I don't know where it will errupt from first: my family, my freinds or my friends from home.  My mom is constantly venting how much she is angry with my aunt (who lives across the street from us) and its getting to a boiling point becuase all of the responisiblity for 3 households is being dumped on my mother.  Granted, my brother and I help out, but we don't really know how much more we can do.  I take that back, I help out, my brother runs around and smokes pot with the other neighborhood hoodlums, and he owes me $135.  (Pay up you smarmy bitch!)  Last night I had a dream that my best friend from home, Ashley and I, had a huge falling out and it was very public and very bitter and it was a dirty, mean and otherwise nasty war of words.  I'm scared to think this might be coming.  I don't forsee any reason why it would, but generally when I dream about something thats not totally insane and wacky it will generally happen within a month.  I'm also starting to rethink my whole "Hey, Ash, let's get an apartment together" kick I was on.  I can only be responsible for me and I have to lead by example, not by doing everything for people.  Finally this morning I saw that a lot of drama had apparently occured over night.  I think people are starting to think that my friends and I are bitches.  Yes, we are bitches to a certain extent.  Yes, we are "those girls" who are gossipy and mock everyone, but we do it more as a joke than anything else.  People really need to learn to lighten up.  Everyone gets down on us for beign bitchy, but I know personally that my outward "I'm better than you" act is just that, an act, 'cause on the inside I'm quite insecure, but being able to act this way gives me some sort of sense of self esteem in my life.    Maybe I'm just PMSy and moody.  Who knows.

Be sure and click all of the links, because no 2 links are the same, and some of them are pictures from our trip while others are awesome links!  I hope you make it to the end, good luck and Godspeed!**  God, where do I even start trying to recap this weekend?!?  I know I'm gonna leave a kajillion things out, but here goes:   Friday  Anna, Missy and I arrive in Boston in the early afternoon and we're greeted by a cutie with the Bah-ston accent who wants to "pahk our cah".  Check in and check out the  urlLink room.   Real plates and glasses, silverware, a fridge, heated floors everything was brand new, free highspeed internet access, alright, we were kinda pimpin'.  We were starving so we wandered around the Charlestown 'hood, but we some how ended up in the  urlLink ghetto , so we called for a cab and decided not to wait on the corner 'cause we'd look like some hookers.  The cabbie picks us up and takes us to  urlLink Newbury Street  for some  K I L L E R  shopping.  We had a quick lunch and realized in Boston that they don't talk about the penis so much as they talk about the "CAHCK" (those wacky Massholes!)  Anyhow we hit up  urlLink the shops at the Prudential Center  and spent WAY too much money in  urlLink Sephora (you devil store, you!) .  Back to the room for some time primp and get ready to go out.     urlLink We got all gussied up to go out and pimp it with some of the local boys.   We asked the valet guys in the lobby where we should go and they suggested a delightful little spot which I now hold dear to my heart, called  urlLink The Rack .  We were all a little skeptical on it, but it turned out to be a veritable martini Mecca!  At the Rack we enjoyed a myriad of delightful new 'tinis like the trusted old favorite  urlLink the Apple Martini.   This one, however, had a new twist, it was served in a glass rimmed with green sugar, and garnished with a cherry, candy apple slice and a little jungle animal toy.  There were also some new yummy martinis like the  urlLink watermelon martini  and the  urlLink blue raspberry martini.   Tres yum!  Needless to say the drinks kinda snuck up on us and we started chatting up  urlLink the guys next to us  and found out that one of them,  urlLink "Awesome" Andy , is a super big fan of local New York radio superstar,  urlLink Sheeplover .  Being that we have the pleasure of knowing him by his real identity,  urlLink Don Labia  we got to score some extra points with Andy and  urlLink his boys.   We got drunker and decided to call it a night and when we got back to the hotel there was much running through the halls, pleading with the front desk guy to let us swim and ordering pizza to be had.     Saturday  We were a little hung over Saturday morning, and poor  urlLink Missy  was feeling sickies, but we decided to head out to the  urlLink New England Aquarium  where we got our picture taken with Sammy the Seal (that pic will come later, 'cause its on "real film"), we saw some penguins and got a little annoyed with all the little bitchy kids in there, so we hightailed it on out.  Oh, I almost forgot:  this is a big fuck you to  urlLink Digital City  because every single time we looked something up on there we found out it had gone out of business like 2 years previously, like our sushi place where you sit on the floor and are all cool or our psychic or any of the other bum directions you fucks gave us!  But I digress, we did some MORE shopping at  urlLink Faneuil Hall  (apparently its pronounced Fan-yull).  We waited in the room and napped and what not until the lovely  urlLink Lisa  arrived.    Then we got all gussied up again and headed out for dinner.  We came across a place called  urlLink The Rock Bottom Brewery  for a pretty yummy dinner, but not before getting harassed by a  urlLink bleeding bum  for cigarettes.  Although it wasn't a total loss cause we were held up long enough outside to run across a  urlLink bachelor party  brimming with hot, HOT guys.  Woo wooo!  The night kind of sucked from there, because we went to the  urlLink Roxy  which sucked some seriously hardcore ass.  Picture a normal, packed dance club in Manhattan, full of trendy people (even if you LOATHE places like this, just picture it for me).  Now: make these people 2 years behind in fashion and remove like three quarters of the people from the club.  Age the remaining quarter by 10 years and make half of those Portuguese, now you can imagine perhaps even the littlest bit how shitty the "Boston Roxy" was.  We left there to hit up  urlLink The Good Life  because their business card promised  urlLink oversized martinis , alas there were none.  There were, however, some  urlLink cute boys there  (although they were kicked out immediately following this photo).    We decided to split and head back to the  urlLink  Rack  so we could show Lisa how good the  urlLink appletinis  were there.  We also saw more  urlLink Boston fashion victims  laughed, danced, were accosted by boys, met some normal ones, saw some junk and almost got in a fight over a cab (fucking masshole bitches, we're WAY better).  We made it home in one piece and called it a night.   Sunday  We were all sick, we ate sushi, I puked and a bird shit on me, we drove home, we saw a bad accident.  The end, thanks for reading this much!! MwAh!

        urlLink   Equilibrium         Let me ask you something. Why are you alive?   I live to safeguard the continuity of this society, to serve Libria.  It's circular. You exist to continue your existence. What's the point?  What's the point of your existence?  To feel! 'Cause you have never done it, you can never know it. But it's as vital as breath. And without it, without love, without anger, without sorrow, breath is just a clock... ticking     Thats a lil bit out of the movie Equilibrium   Its a utopia stoy you know how those go but I liked this alot I thought maybe it woudl be dull but the action is fun story agian you see it comeing sorta cause what mroe can a utopian story be but it tells it good and i liked it i wish it was still on i wish it was 80 hours long

       For My Local Peeps   Alright Boos & Ghouls (God, Im a nerd...)   October is almost upon us so as one last outdoor spooky outing we should do something fun, like go to Six Flags for Fright Fest. (insert spooky werewolf howl here)   Im thinking Saturday October 25th and aim to be there around 2-ish and stay for a while.  Tell everyone you know, 'cause I didn't know many email addys to invite people, but it should be hella frickin' fun.     I hope at least some of you will come and if you bring one coke can between two people you can get half price admission (well 2 for the price of one but you'd split that price of one so its half price).  Also we can prolly work out some sort of carpool to get down there so let me know if you want in or not.      >^..^

       Important announcement for the Girlies!   Brands don't mean everything... This is how to test Lipstick for "Lead"... Keep reading.  Lead is a chemical that causes cancer.  Recently a brand called, "Red Earth" decreased their prices from HK$67 to HK$9.9 ... It contained lead.       The Brands, which contain Lead, are:       1. Christian Dior       2. LANCOME       3. CLINIQUE       4. Y.S.L       5. ESTEE LAUDER       6. SHISEIDO       7. RED EARTH (Lip Gloss)       8. CHANEL (Lip Conditioner)       9. Market America-Motives lipstick    The higher the lead content, the greater the chance of causing Cancer. After doing a test on lipsticks, it was found that the Y.S.L. lipstick contained the most amount of lead. Watch out for those lipsticks, which are supposed to stay longer. If your Lipstick stays longer, it is because of the higher content of lead.    Here is the test you can do yourself:       1. Put some lipstick on your hand,       2. Use a 24k -14k Gold ring to scratch on the       lipstick.       3. If the lipstick colour changes to black then you       know the lipstick contains lead.

       Dear WC Guy In My Office,    I have been forced to sit next to you for over a year now. This means I have also been forced to be subjected to your vile and otherwise rank stench of rotting elephant poop with hay and baby wipes. This also means I've had to endure you're fucking smelly assed Spanish cooking that you bring in and make everyone suffer through. Finally I have to suffer through you making your "business" phone calls ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.   I would just like to offer the following suggestions to you on behalf of everyone in the office who has no balls:  1) Take a fucking shower you reek of dirty uncleansed ass and its really unpleasant for us to have to be around you. Don't you ever notice that cloud of fucking lysol and Yankee candle room spray floating down on you? THAT'S BECAUSE WE CANT FUCKING STAND YOUR VILE ASS, DOUCHEBAG.   2) You might not want to clip your fingernails at your desk cause they fly onto my desk and that is fucking nasty. You don't want to piss me off because I'm contemplating retaliation which involves used tamps. So fucking knock it off.   3)When you're making a personal call, you might want to a) not make them in Spanish, cause its ABUNDANTLY clear that they're not for business, b) shut your fucking mouth when you're on one because I know what you're talking about and its Brazilian soccer matches and you think no one knows what you're talking about and you're fucking SCREAMING in my ear when I'm trying to actually field business calls, you fag, c) if I hear you say "Puta, Doctor" or "oon-bo-leavable" one more time I am gonna come over there and fucking choke you out with the phone cord, you useless piece of shit.   4) When I wear a skirt please refrain from telling me that I look beautiful in it because you're a fucking creep and that's sexual harassment cause you're a skeevy fuck. Its not my fault that you got into a fucking accident and can no longer run batches so leave me out of it.   5) Do yourself a favor and go die 'cause I fuckin' hate you!       Regards,  Gwen  P.S. No, this isn't PMS, I just  really  hate you.

       How On Earth??    "Hey,    Its me.  Anyhow, you're right, I'm a little annoyed at what went on on Friday.  You put me in a really akward position and I'm sorry, but I can't lie to someones parents, thats just really messed up so when your mom called you and said she spoke to me, it wasn't a lie, she did call and I did tell her that no, I did not have your computer.  She knew I didnt have it even before I told her, she just called to make 100% sure.  What you do with your family is your business, and what you do with [boyfriend] is your business, but please, I dont have time to be caught up in lies and the resulting drama of the lies for something that doesn't even directly affect me.     I know it sounds bitchy, but honestly: I am really busy during the week I have class m-th until 830 every night, I come home and have homework to do, only to get up and have to get ready for work at 6am the next morning.  You guys have to stop bleeping me at like 3:45 in the morning 'cause I'm tryign to sleep and thats not fair.     I want to be friends with you and you know it, but you're making it really hard by putting me in these wierd situations.  I already had to lie to my mom about one thing, but its out now so I can stop.  I dont want to have to lie about stuff.  It doesn't end well.   If you want to be mad at me for saying this, thats your choice and I suppose I respect it, but I hope you will realize your family is your family, you cant change that and it seems from the convo I had with your mom that you're pushing them away.  I dont want to not be on speaking terms with you like we were for the last few years, I just can't get involved in stuff that doesnt involve me.  ~G  Reply: well i told them the truth like 5 days ago and i dont bleep you at 345  [boy] does...we call you because you dont call back. it seems to be that  you have so many more important things to do with yuor time than  actually call me back or hang out. and thats fine thats your decision.  i  dont know if you call me then i guess we will talk and hang out and if you  dont them im sorry but i tried and i called and i left messages and  everything and by you ignoring me and everything is not what friends do.   if i put you in bad positions, my bad. i didnt think it was such a big  deal. but i guess to you it is. so i guess i just wont involve you in  my life anymore because you are too busy with your own. im sorry for  bothering you."    How on earth did that guilt trip almost work on me?   How on earth did you even have the balls and try to turn that around on me? How on earth did you tell your parents the truth five days ago when on Friday your mom had called me to bust you in the lie? How on earth can I possibly come out of this looking like the badguy? (Yet somehow I know I will) How on earth did we grow so far apart as friends? How on earth is it possible that we were inseperable and practically shared a brain and ended up on such different ends of the spectrum? How on earth can you not see what you're doing to your life and try and help yourself?

       Gwen Mad!  Gwen Smash!   Okay I have been holding this in for quite sometime, but its finally come boiling to a head:   FUCK YOU, JOB.  FUCK YOU RIGHT IN YOUR DIRTY LITTLE ASS WITH OUT LUBE.  FUCK YOU TIL YOU BLEED.   No, this isn't an angry rant about wheelchair guy or any of my other insensitive prick stories.  This is a matter of just climbing out from under the moutain of bullshit that has been the last three years of my life.    First of all, when people come in and ask for a parking permit and I tell them its on the first floor, don't get huffy with me because you have to go back downstairs.  If you actually  read  the letter you were sent, you'd have seen that it says the permits are issued by the Finanace Department,  but available at the parking permit office on the first fucking floor across from the elevator.  Also, it is not my fault that you are being charged a late fee on your bill becasue you decided you were too important to mail me a $10.00 check in July, and when you've paid late every single year for the last two years.  Also, don't try and tell me that you've never paid this before, 'cause I'm gonna fucking tell you both of the past check numbers  AND  that you were late both times.  It will only get uglier from there.  Last week I had an unfortunate accident: I went to the proctologist and he did a seemingly delightful thing by taking my head out of my ass, however this apparently removed me from being in the running and being qualified for any of the positions here in the Town.  Furthermore, it is absolutely ludicris that I am not  qualified  to be a fucking secretary here, and its even  more  ludicris that  I am qualified  to be a financial analyst like Anthony and do the same work ( PLUS  my Alarm Ordinance duties on top of it) and still not be able to get the same pay rate as him 'cause of "union issues".    You know what: this isnt the first time this shit has happened.  I should have taken that job at mastercard, but nooooooo, I decided that although you had fucked me in the ass once before it wasn't good enough, I wanted to stick around for  more  lubeless anal maraudings...that maybe this time I'd get lucky and you'd use something sharp like a fucking pine cone, you fucking jerkoffs.    I'm so out of here, you can keep paying me the same bullshit pay-rate you've got me at and dick me out of my first step which should have netted me 3k more a year cause there was an "issue" and I will just sit here and use your precious time to look for a new, better job with an entirely different set of bullshit co-workers and issues, but you know what: at least I'm  choosing  who gets to fuck me up the ass rather than leaving it up to my supervisors and union reps to decide who gets to hold the broom this week.    Fuck off and die and I will keep staring longingly at the paper cutter looking for a swift way to slit my wrists with it.

       Pills are good...PILLS ARE GoOd!   Another smashing weekend with the totally awesome  urlLink Boyfriend .  Today is our very first "monthaversary", which is very smooshy and exciting.  Yay!  Anyhow, we went down to the city on Friday night to see  urlLink Trace Element  play at Arlene's Grocery.  They really rocked, the new singer, Danny, was amazing and the vibe the guys give off on stage now is just so awesome and can get you totally amped!  After the show we went to Danny's apartment for some beers and to hang out.  Really stand up guy.  The boyf fell asleep while we were there, so we headed out around 1 a.m.    Bright and early Saturday morning who shows up to rouse us from our slumber?   urlLink Caaaaaaaable Guyyyyyyy , but it was sweet 'cause now I have IO, the spiffy digital cable so I can watch  urlLink Noggin  and  urlLink Tech TV  with the cool kids like Sheeps and  urlLink Anna .  Dennis and I took turns beating the SNOT out of each other in Super Monkey Ball 2 (recently renamed "Super Perp Ball 2", but thats a story for another time).  He headed home, I napped for a while and then headed out to the  urlLink Red Door Spa  for a really great, really relaxing massage.  Came home, headed up to Rockland where Dennis and I met up with the always lovely,  urlLink Christie  at the J (aka the Palisades Center) where we were denied foodage at the Cheesecake Factory again, beacuse of another 2 hour wait.  We ended up eating at Romano's Macaroni Grill which was equally as yum and gave us some time to paruse the selection of exciting novels at  urlLink Barnes & Noble .  I swear to God, that store is crack to me.  I love, love, love it!  Before dinner we all scribbled on the table with some crayons, watched people leave their baby to eat a full portion of macaroni & cheese by himself and had the same crappy waiter we had last time.  It was all good in the hood though, good company can make anything better.  Sunday was a day filled with manicures, pedicures and naps.  I love naps, they're what weekends were made for.  Anyhow we went to Eclisse, this really delicious northern Italian restaurant, for my Grandmother's birthday.  My family all got along and there was no fighting.  It was nice and unusual at the same time.  Dennis came back up to CT sunday night and we went to  urlLink Cosi  in Rye for some S'mores and Arctic Vanilla Lattes.  Also very yum and really nice to see him on a Sunday night since I usually only get to see him on Friday & Saturday.  We went back to Chez Gwen for a lil while and started watching "Black Hawk Down", no matter how many times I watch that movie I still get really hyped up and pissed off about it and I still get really sad even though I know how its going to end.  New discovery though, Legolas (aka Orlando Bloom) with out hair and a cute southern drawl is just as hot as he is with a bow and elvish ears.  Anyhow, that raps it up for my weekend.  Oh I almost forgot  urlLink FUCK YOU  to my brother for getting 4 speeding vios in EZ Pass lanes in one week which resulted in the revocation of my ezpass account.  Go fuck yourself and stop spending your money on pot and condums to bang your dirty "Jenny from the block" wannabe girlfriend and start paying for your own shit from now on or I'm gonna tell mom, douchebag.

The bartender, scurvy bildrat that he is says "Uh, Sir, you know you have a wheel coming out of your pants?"  The pirate simply replies "Argh yes, its driving me nuts"  Now laugh or walk the fuckin' plank.

       A Brand New Day   Well I want to apologize for yesterday, it was a little rough and I had to vent, but I guess in part thats why some of you come here: to read my maniacal and otherwise insane rantings.  I have spoken to people at Nextel, and the dirtbag is blocked from calling me.  All of his numbers (which unfortunately cuts me off from his sister, who is one of my friends).    Anyhow, I want to say THANK YOU SO MUCH to  urlLink The Boyf  for calling me up last night to tell me silly jokes and make me laugh and remind me of how awesome he is and that I don't need to worry myself about all this crap.  So, yay.  This morning the power was out at  urlLink my job  for 2 hours.  Rather than sending us home, they mayoral figure and A-Number-One Douchebag, decided to keep us here "just in case".  Unfortunately the power came back on, but it was fun to not do anything for a few hours.  Everyone just sat around and acutally got to talk to each other and it was nice to get along.  We all chipped in money and Pat got sent on a  urlLink Dunkin' Donuts Run  to get some coffee and for everyone.  It was fun to have an impromptu mini party.  I haven't acutally done any REAL work yet this A.M. though as I've been doing work on my Western Civ presentation on the "Carolignian Renaissance" and getting some stuff together that I have to mail at lunchtime from  urlLink ebaY  sales I've made.    So in conclusion, I just wanted to let you all know that I'm feeling much more cheery and back to my usual Gwennish self.  I also wanted to share a joke with you that I love love love...  Q:  Why did the cookie go to the hospital?  A:  Because he felt  CRUMMY   Get it?? Get it?? ::rimshot::  Don't forget to tip your waitress, you've been a great crowd.

       P.S. Here's An Idea...   When you call someone and they don't answer, leave a message and if they don't call you back then it prolly means they hate you and hope you die and you should fuck off.  It is not a good idea to keep calling six times while someone is in class trying to be smart and pay attention and be better than you.  Its called harassment and tomorrow the good lil elves at nextel will know about it too.  So what you get is more Maroon 5:  "How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable So condescending unnecessarily critical I have the tendency of getting very physical So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle   You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here This Double Vision I was seeing is finally clear You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on   When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say There's no way we're gonna give up And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head You should know better you never listened to a word I said Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did  When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love You'll understand what I mean when I say There's no way we're gonna give up And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe   Does it kill Does it burn Is it painful to learn That it's me that has all the control  Does it thrill Does it sting When you feel what I bring And you wish that you had me to hold "  I need it to be Friday asap.

       Dear Joe,   Please stop calling me at three a.m. and telling me all these inane things about how you dream of me and how it "means something" and its a "sign".  Clearly, all it is a sign of is the fact that you're a complete drug addict, psychotic loser.    I don't care if you're "over Reenie", I don't care how many times or on what precious thing you swear you'll never cheat on me again.  I don't care that you'll never raise your hand to me or yell at me again.  I know you won't do any of this anymore becuase I'm not ever going to give you the chance to.    I'm through with you, I've BEEN through with you, I have found someone so far superior to you in every aspect that he makes your mere existence seem like a cruel, cruel joke to the world.  You had the best thing you could have ever imagined and thankfully for me, you didn't realize it so now I've gotten away from you and I'm done, through, finished.    Please stop calling me or I will have the lovely people at nextel block you from calling me, and should you try to call me from Colleen's phone, I will have a harassment complaint filed against you.  You are  so  last summer....no, you are so last lifetime.  You suck, go get your own life and stay out of mine.  Its like  urlLink Maroon 5  said: " Does it make you sad to find yourself alone?  And does it make you mad to find that I have grown?  I'll bet it hurts so bad to see the strength that I have shown.   Hoping to never hear from you again, Gwen

       Cuteness Abounding    urlLink The Boy  & I (pictured below from back in the winter) had such a great time just relaxing and chatting it up and snuggling this weekend.  Another great time indeed.  He recapped it all already on his blog so if you're  that  interested you can check it out over there.  He's the bestest though.    In other news, we rescued a 12 yr old cocker spaniel from the  urlLink Elmsford Animal Shelter  in Elmsford, NY.  He has an absolutely sweet disposition and for a 12 yr old dog he's got a lot of life in him and the cutest lil puppy trot I've ever seen!  He is already making friends with the cats, and our other pup, Sahara.  Though we may not get to spend that time with him as he is quite old, at least he won't have to spend the rest of his days in a cage waiting for someone to adopt him.    I know everyone loves puppies and kittens, but there are a lot of older pets out there who need love too and would make AWESOME pets (sometimes better than the babies 'cause they're already trained and what not).  They're just as loyal and sweet and calm so they wont destroy your house and many of them still have lots of years of love and nuzzles to give you.  Just something to think about.  Also if any of you guys are in the area and looking you should DEFINTILEY check out E.A.S., 'cause they have a really big selection and are really helpful with the adoption/transition process.  Also if you have any old comforters, blankets, towels, cleaning supplies or really anything useful, rather than throw them out, think about donating to a local animal rescue agency, its expensive to care for all of these pets with out consistent funding and knowing you helped the lil furries will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.

       I Give Up On Sports   Okay, so I'm a natural loser picker.  I accept that.  I root for the NY Jets, the NY Rangers and the NY Mets.  I accept mediocrity, in fact I root for the underdog, not to beat the odds, but rather becuase, well....someone's gotta root for 'em.    Anyhow, the Jets season is over 'cause the great white hype, Chad Pennington, broke his hand preseason so we're stuck with Vinny QB-ing and I personally have no hand eye coordination, but am a better QB.  NOW the f'n Rangers have lost Pavel Burre pretty much permanently due to knee injuries and Leetch is also out this season AND the deal fell thru for Jagr so again we get the shaft.  What I don't understand though is this: last year the roster on paper for the Rangers looked  absolutely unstoppable and they still sucked balls.  What the hell, yo?  Rar.

       New Look, Again...   Okay kiddies, this is it...new look  I am very proud of the changes I made to the template.  All I need is a new logo graphic, so I turn to you.  It needs to be the same black and pink that my blog colors are and it needs to say "Musings of a Dynamite Diva" (I don't care whether or not you work in the mumblings rumblings and stumblings part) and I want a bomb with a reverse "D" logo like the one picture here (but black and pink black and pink!!!!)    Good luck, lets get creative and the winner will get hella crazy mad props (hows that for an incentive, eh??)

       Coooooooooooooooool!   Blogger is getting rid of its pay services because of the Google merger because they have enough bandwith now.  So now everyone will have the same features with or without paying, but becuase I bellied up to the bar and acutally  paid  for this thing back in the day, they're doing something very nice for me.  They're giving me a  urlLink FREE BLOGGER HOODIE!   I know you're all jealous 'cause you're prolly like me and stare longingly at the Blogger & Google merchandise, but you just can't bring yourself to pay for it.  Now I get to have the pretty hoodie and be warm and blogalicious all over town.  I know, I know its not really free, but since I'm not shelling out for it now, its all good in the 'hood(ie!).  What has movable type ever given you?  Suckers!

       Weekend Recap   Another weekend filled with awesome  urlLink boyfriend-y  goodness.  I am so, so lucky.  In related, but unrelated news, I haven't taken my Paxil in over a week and except for this one wired auditory side-effect I'm doing fine.  Normally I get very nauseous and sick and tired and icky, but I consciously decided to stop taking it rather than just running out of it and I'm doing well.  I guess there is something to be said for being generally happy and functioning normally.  Friday Doogie came up here to CT and we had planned on having some sushi and renting The Two Towers and just vegging and maybe building a blanket fort in my super comfy bed, but this didn't end up being the plan.   Ashley (yes, the girl I was having all the loan problems with) called me up to tell me how the problem was getting resolved and she ended up telling me a lot of really bad news she was having so I offered to take her out for one drink, also to give Dennis a chance to meet her.  My friend Stacey was having a party at our favorite watering hole, The Turtle (which has since been renamed the Hungry Hamster), and the plan was to just go for one drink.  Well, prior to even getting there the drama started.  I don't want to get into it in case some of the people involved actually read this, but it was MEGA dramatic.  One drink turned into three or four or maybe more.  There was some dancing, some more drama and some spilled drinks, but all in all it was fun.  It was an interesting way for Dennis to meet some of my friends, but now he knows I don't make all the drama up, LOL.   We got back to my house and there were a few disasters with a martini shaker filled with various schnapps (Jon, think Sudi's upside down martini shaking) and a piece of lemon coconut cake that I wasn't apparently meant to have.  It was funny for me though cause I was a "maroon" as the boy says, but he knows he was laughing too.  We got snuggly for a lil bit and fell asleep together for a nap, it was really sweet.  Saturday was a parade in Pearl River where Dennis and his boys from "The Hut" were marching.  They all looked awesome in their uniforms and clean up real nice.  They won two trophies as well.  After the parade, there was a lot, and I mean a lot of beer drinking.  What is it about free beer that makes it taste so good?  Anyhow, I got to know some of the people there from the fire house a little better and ate some yummy food and danced and laughed a lot.  It was a pretty good time.  Let me tell ya 2 things I've learned:  1) firemen can DRINK 2) firemen can really have a good time. I'm a little scared of the "mysterious cowboy fireman" and his line dancing ways (no, I did NOT line dancee), but it was another really nice night.    We definitely weren't meant to get our sushi this weekend, but next weekend we've agreed regardless of what else comes up one night is definitely going to be a movie/sushi/snuggling night ofgoodnesss.  Oh yeah and tomorrow I am getting that fancy new IO digital cable so I will be able to wax intellectual on the marvels of TechTV, Noggin, and all the other "money" channels that all the cool kids are talking about these days.  Oh yeah, I'll also finally have HBO again.  YAY YAY YAY!

       1,000 Things   'I'm overjoyed and over loved and feeling lucky  like a little boy who's hiding under covers and looking to discover any way to play the part inside his darkened cave well the meaning of life it starts at the nightlight close your eyes and hope to see mine  well I've seen a thousand things in one place but I stopped my counting when I saw your face erasing memory I feel as though I've never seen a face before  until I saw your eyes smiling back at me thru my tears I've been counting all these years Now suddenly the thousand things I've seen were  nothing more than dreams of you and me  you and me quietly at a stand still fortunately you will kiss me and I'll kiss you back fact of the matter of is that I don't know what the latter is that I always wanted to kiss you but  I always wanted to run from you Because I always wanted to miss you  And that I've always wanted to come for you  So... how do you do?  - j. mraz

       Rainy Rantings   Today its quite rainy and rather dreary and I just don't want to be in a happy shiny mood.  Thats not to say that anything is pissing me off, but its hard to smile sometimes when you're like this.  Mix that with the fact that I haven't had a cigarette since Sunday and you have a particularly  urlLink  irritable Diva.     I'm really getting annoyed with the "News Media", the bastards are completely and utterly irresponsible.  First of all they're all trying to jump the gun and get the "breaking news" on a story and they start reporting non-stop on something they have only barebones facts about and half truths.  Then they have to come out and tell the REAL story a few days later 'casue they were all trigger happy and got it all fucked up.  Heres an idea: why don't you do yourself the favor and wait til you get a few SOLID facts before you go blowing things entirely out of proportion and getting everyone in a tizzy.  Secondly:  why don't you stop giving out these exclusive, behind-the-scenes security details about airports, powerplants and military operations.  Why don't you just throw a feed into Osama Bin Laden's fucking cave and tell him exactly what we're planning and where our weaknesses are and then maybe see if he could pencil in a good time to attack us again, you fucking idiots!    I appreciate that we live in a free society and with all the new technology we have its easy for us to explain things, and  I know people are naturally nosy bastids, but I'm sorry, I dont think that we as a society need to know all the intimate details of our national security or lack there-of.  I would rather have you retards keep your fuckin' mouths shut so that we could stop giving the terrorists new ideas on how to attack us.  Do the words "Loose Lips Sink Ships" mean nothing to anyone anymore.  If you're willing to sacrifice security to be "in the know" about stuff, why dont you join the fuckin' service so you can be in the know and do something positive about it instead of just using it as useless watercooler fodder.       I have  urlLink school  again tonight and once again I'm actually looking forward to it.  Probably just cause its the begining of the school year where I think I can acutally make it through a semester without dropping out.  Maybe I'm just motivated 'cause I finally want to get this over with so I can take care of more important things.    On a happier note: all is well with me and Ma Dukes again so I'm happy about that, and although I'm missing  urlLink someone , I know the weekend is coming so we'll be able to rock out real soon.  Oh yeah and its payday this weekend, so thats SUPER sweet and I'm finally growing a set and starting to stick up for myself with someone very bad.  A battle is looming, and although its gonna be bloody and ruin a friendship and hurt feelings it has to be taken on before it gets worse.  Oh yeah, and if she tries anything I can break her arm six ways now, goddamn, I'm good.  :p  Well thats it for now, catch you kiddies on the flipside.  Mwah!

       Why Me?   Why did my mom raise me as a strong and independent person?  Why do I care and care and care about people and try to help them only to get aggravated when they don't try to help themselves?  Why are most of the people in my life a disappointment in the respect that they have so much potential and instead are lazy and feign helplessness?  Why can't I just let them be to fail on their own and why do I internalize it like its my problem and then wonder why I get all these anxiety & panic attacks?

       Weekend Review of Sorts    Friday:  The  urlLink boyfriend  (yes, I said boyfriend...Eeeee!) came down to CT and we went to Stamford Brew Co. and  urlLink Hula Hank's  for some drinks.  Needless to say I got a lil ferschnukered, but its all good in the hood.  We headed back to my house for some TV and a walk around the block cause it was a really nice night and then I hit the proverbial hay shortly thereafter.   Saturday:  Slept in a little and woke up to find my mommy was hella pissed at me about cosigning for a car for my witch of a former best friend.  Understandable, but needless to say she's still angry and I  hate hate hate hate  it when my mommy is angry with me.  Met up with the Doogie at the Palisades Center at  urlLink The Macaroni Grill  for lunch and then headed up to Joisey to collect  urlLink the Sheeps  at which point we headed out to Shaolin to hang with the lovely and othewise rawkin'  urlLink Miss Anna .  There was some drinking ("I have crippled kids, why dont you just field goal my cat while you're at it?!?!"), some Degrassi, some swimming, a proposed trip on the ferry and some scary, bad news about some friends (I hope you guys are doing better).  I also learned how to break your arm in six places so don't F with me! :p   Sunday:  I went up to Rockland for Doogie's Fire Company picnic.  I met his family and many of his friends.  Needless to say it was a little nerve-wracking, but it ended up being a lot of fun.  (Get out of the way, DUMMY!) Seeing him in the context of those guys makes me realize how he could possibly have so many nutty stories, hehehe.   Monday:   I slept all goddamned day waiting for my family's rained-out cookout to commence, but it didn't end up happening until later that night which gave me just enough time to get aggrivated by someone  really  annoying.  Here is a thought: when someone doesn't answer your 15 cellphone calls or 5 messages from that day, you probably shoudln't call their house, 'cause chances are they REALLY don't want to talk to you.  Rar.  Anyhow, Doogie was  so  sweet and drove all the way up here to get some coffee and listen to me vent a little and see how insane the phonecalls from said certain someone were.  Honestly though, God bless that kid, 'cause he saw me run the entire gammut of emotions in a 36 hour period and he's STILL talking to me and acutally intrested in dating, talk about trial by fire.  He's the best, seriously, and its nice to be able to finally brag about him out in the open.  (c:

       A Little of This, A Little of That...   Well I haven't properly blogged in quite a while.  I don't really have a reason why, I guess its just that I haven't really had anything of any real substance to write.  How many times can you guys really sit here and stomach reading all the inconsequential details of my weekend especially if you weren't a part of it?  I dunno, I personally like to hear the details of people's lives, but that's just because I'm nosy and this whole blog thing makes it easier for me to be all up in their business without actually having to pry or speak to them.    What could I tell you guys that you'd possibly care about?  Hmmm...I saw  urlLink Bobby Bonilla  at Dunkin' Donuts this morning.  Just getting his coffee and donuts like everyone else now that he's back in town after the end of the season.  There is a job working for a production company of a  urlLink big name director  that lives locally that is available, but is it worth a 10k paycut initially?  I'm not sure about that.  I also applied for a job at the  urlLink WWE  as an administrative assistant.  That would be cool if it panned out, but I'm not about to go getting my hopes up.  I mean I'm happy with the people I work with (well with one  urlLink glaring exception ) but I've had a lot of responsibility added to my job duties and I think that warrants a bit more than what I'm making now.  At least put me on the same level as my friend who was hired after and basically does the same thing.  I can't wait for November.  October has been a blast, but its just been I N S A N E L Y busy.   urlLink The boy  and I have not stopped running around the entire month!  We had our trip to Montreal,  the Dave Attell/Lewis Black/Mitch Hedberg show with  urlLink The Fuzzy One  and  urlLink Whitey's Man Bitch , the Crankcase show at the Hard Rock, Six Flags trip, tonite we have a  urlLink Maroon Five  show to go to at Roseland and Friday we have a wedding.  I think both of us really just need a rest.  I dunno about him but I plan to spend all my November weekends snuggled in under the covers with a home cooked meal and a bottle of wine watching all the movies I've never seen (trust me, its a H U G E list).  I think the only time he and I will probably go out is to go see Matrix Revolutions 'cause he's a bigtime Matrix fanboy.  I really miss my bebe,  urlLink Lisa  (Effmeboobs in the pic), she's the bestest and I know she's hella busy with her new job, but if she sees this: call me.  We need coffee or a massage or facial or something girly.  I love ya so much, girlie!  I'm getting excited for the  urlLink Bozzies .  They're only five days away.  I hear the after party is gonna be a good one so make sure you get on the list, pronto.  I'll catch ya on the flipside kiddies, behave!

       You Stink!   Dear guy who wrote "Yankees How Ya Doin'?",  YOu really suck.  that is *the* worst song EVER.  Its totally unoriginal, totally annoying and totally stupid!  How many other lame crappy baseball songs can you make?  I bet you're the same 'tard who wrote "Who let the mets out?"  My question is: who let you out?  You're probably some drooly mongoloid who's mother told him he was funny when he was little.  Guess what?  Just like Santa and the EasterBunny, this too is a lie.  Write better songs.  You're poop.  I hope I never hear that song again.  Good day, Sir! Gwen

       America, Jr.    I spent the weekend in Montreal with my  urlLink lovely boyfriend .  On the drive up we stopped for dinner in Lake George Village which was really nice and we ended up going to the  urlLink Stewart's  for some fuel and some super yummy orange soda.  I wish we had Stewart's around here.  )c:  We ended up staying at the Hotel Suites Le Faubourg.  If you guys are planning a trip to Montreal I definitley reccomend a stay here.  The rooms are huge, its a brand new construction one block from St. Catharine street and its in the heart of the downtown area.  It was like we had an apartment for a weekend: huge living room, huge bedroom and a kitchen to boot.  Only thing is the website said they had "high speed internet access" but it cost $10 a day, so we didn't end up using it.  We checked in pretty late Friday night so we just crashed in the room and were all bright eyed and bushy tailed on Saturday morning.    We ate lunch at this awesome little Asian place called "SoupBol" and went shopping on Saint Catherine street which was a lot of fun.  I ended up finding a new favorite store!  I wanted to go to  urlLink Roots  which is like the Abercrombie of Canada, but alas they were just as pricey.  I ended up instead in a really cute shop,  urlLink Le Garage , its like a Canadian Contempo Casuals hooch mart, but I really liked it.  Lots of cute clothes, lots of BRIGHT PINK! clothes, it was quite Gwennish indeed.  We stopped in to the  urlLink Canadian version of D'agostinos  for some beers to drink before we went out.  Dennis LOVED the walk in beer fridge and just kind of stood around inside it for about five whole minutes just oogling all the beer.  We went back to the room and I would like to say  I WAS NOT DRUNK , yet, but I walked into the wall face first.  What made it worse was Dennis had been in the other room and wouldn't have seen it, except he went to take his shoes off in the bedroom and was witness to the whole thing.  Saturday night we ended up at  urlLink The Casino Montreal  which was a lot of fun.  I ended up doing really well on the slot machines there and the boy of course played the "ponies".  It was crowded as anything though, so we cut it short and left whilst we were up.  Sunday morning we ate at this awful place called Rubens, the food was decent, but the service was atrocious.  Our waitress spoke only in French to us even though we were ordering in English and she not only attended to everyone who came in after us, but served them all before she served us.  Its not like our meals were anythign that took a while to cook.  We ordered French Toast with eggs and a cheeseburger.  Damn, rude Frenchies!  Sunday afternoon we went down town to the  urlLink Montreal Science Center  and did some neat hands-on experiments.  Doog sat on nails and made TV and radio shows and me, being the nerdy girl that I am, learned Binary.  I sat there for about half an hour until I taught myself how to do it and then I made Dennis go back to the beginning of the museum so I could answer the "Binary Math Quiz".  Oh and we saw this cool thing where it was how you turn pure electricity into water.  I thougt that was badass.    We went back to the centre of town and had a mini bar crawl starting at "Iggy's Pub" where 1 Smirnoff Ice and one pt of Stella Artois was $15!  We did get to check up on the NFL progress and I will give him props (Hun, ya gave me a hellatial asswhompin this week).  Anyhow, next stop was Dundee's, what a great bar.  Good atmosphere, nice bartenders, strong drinks.  A great time indeed.  The final stop on the "crawl" was Stogie's/Ice/London Pub (a three in one place) where I ended up with a sub-par apple martini, but a great view of the street on a really nice little terrace thingy.  We finally ended up at our dinner location:  urlLink Mexicali Rosa's  where we got some really AWESOME tex-mex food and a whole pitcher of the strongest Sangria I'd ever had.  Needless to say I was a little blitzed at this point, but we drove back to the hotel room.  Down the busy main street of St. Catharine, through the confusing construction zone that was there and right when we got literally 5 feet from our hotel parking lot we got stopped by the Fuzz.  Thats right.  I started panicking thinking I was gonna get a DUI or something, but they were very nice and let us go.  Turns out you're not allowed to make a right on red anywhere in Montreal.  So if you ever go there, please follow the rule!  The cops were very nice to us though.    Monday morning we were a little sad it was our last day, but we ended up eating at Nickel's Diner, this chain of 50's style diners owned by Celine Dion.  It was acutally really good food and the waitress was nice.  We ended up going to some like garden of plant statues (I'm sure it has a name, but I dunno what it is) down by the Science Centre and it wasn't worth the money we paid to get into it.  We just thought it would be a cool place to get some pictures of the two of us together, but alas everyone there spoke french and looked at us like we had three heads when we tried to ask them to take a picture.  After the bastard rose garden thing, we went to the Notre Dame Basillica which was just a few blocks away.  It was really stunning and if you ever get the chance to go there, even if you aren't Catholic or even regligious the art work alone is breathtaking.  After being in such a holy place we had to up the sin factor and we went back to the Casino where I lost all my money (but it was the end of the trip so who cared).  When we got to the border we stopped for some duty free shopping and were given the shake down by the bull dyke border guard who stopped us for about five minutes.  Dinner at Friday's on our way home in Saratoga Springs and then we were back home before we knew it.  It was unbelieveable though how quickly a six hour drive can pass when you're engaged in conversation.  I left out the inside jokes to spare y'all, but I'm sure they'll be back in another blog soon so don't feel too left out!  Honestly I can say it was one of the best weekends ever!

       Realization   I realized I spend WAY and I mean WAY too much time online.  I am guaranteed to be awake from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. That's approximately 16 hours I would say that I probably spend about 11 of those hours online (three of those hours I'm NOT on I'm at school with no computer available).  No wonder I feel like I'm flabby and over weight.  Its cause I am.  I am sitting in front of this idiot box all day.  I have decided to make a conscious effort and stop being a fatty lazy internet savvy girl with a wicked case of carpal tunnel.  From now on I will only be online during business hours (that's 8 am-4 pm Monday thru Friday) and on weekends, but I'm generally out with the boyfriend on those days so I won't probably be around then either.    I will kick it up at the gym and instead of doing one hour a day I will do two hours.  I will spend one of my extra hours cooking healthier meals for me to eat during the rest of the week.  I could get a hobby or something, I could even (gasp) volunteer.  I will start reading again (you know, that weird thing where you have actual bound papers with writing and you flip through them and they tell you a story).  This is totally out of control.  Seriously.  How I got this far I'll never know, but I refuse to be this lazy any longer.   **Those of you who actually know me know that I say something like this about once every six months and I go all gung ho about stuff for 2 weeks and then I go back to being lazy, slobby, fat self.  If you see me online and its not work hours don't talk to me.  Tell me to fuck off and stop being fat and lazy.  Thank you **

       Weekendy Goodness   Well well well, here we are back at work after another  stellar  weekend with  urlLink the boy .  Friday we hung out with the lovely Christie at a fashion show.  We got to model wedding dresses and the boy got all gussied up in a tux (man, does he clean up nicely!).  It was fun to get all dressed up, I even got to wear a tiara, I was super stoked about that.  Well, that and Christie's Batman Wedding Gown.  Anyhow, we ended up later in the night at this cool bar called the Upper Deck.  They make a mean steak and cheese (damn it, now I'm starving!) and we enjoyed much drinkage and then headed over to the dorms for Dominican College.  (Oddly enough these dorms are at the hotel that  urlLink Jon  and I stayed at after the Ron & Fez Christmas party last year.  My infamous trek down Rte. 59 should have ended there, but no, I ended up in a NY State Trooper Car, drunk and bawling my eyes out, LOL.)  Anyhow, it was in these dorms that I realized: no matter how bad I want to go back to college, there is no way I can live in a dorm.  I am just too old to do it.  The boy and I felt quite out of place when we were there.  Everyone was really sweet and really nice, but it was just wired, like when we had to hide beer for fear of the R.A.   Saturday was a lot of fun as well.  We hit up the diner and got some yumalicious pancakes and then we went to  urlLink Woodbury Commons  for some bitchin' outlet shopping.  I got some sweet new jeans and a cool jean skirt and some sweatpants and some cool Roxy stuff.  The boy got some snazzy new clothes and an Obi Wan light saber.  His little levitating Yoda toy that came with it was a little disappointing though.  It was all and all a giant fun time....  The night only got better though, because we met up with  urlLink Lou  and the Lovely Lisa for some good eating's at this hibachi place in white plains and followed it up with  urlLink School Of Rock  at New Roc City.  We were gonna go play some glow in the dark mini golf afterwards, but we're all old bastids now and we decided to go home and rest our hips and wait for our AARP cards.    Sunday the boy and I tried again to eat at  urlLink Cheesecake Factory , again, but alas it was an hour wait for breakfast, and my tummy isn't that forgiving before its first meal.  We headed over to  urlLink City Limits Diner  instead.  I was almost taken out by a guy in a Porsche, but whatever, it was tasty food stuffs and great company.  Back to Chez Gwen for some maxin' and relaxin' and then we ate with my fam (who absolutely ADORE Doogie, who doesn't!!) and enjoyed some more  urlLink Band of Brothers .  I'm REALLY diggin' this mini series.  Its interesting and well written, the cinematography is great and its overall just amazing.  I'm glad he's gettin' me into this stuff.   It was nice cause we got to have another sleep over last night as well 'cause he's a lucky school system employee and still gets the Jewish holidays off.    Anyhow, that about wraps it up.  I hope all of y'all had a good a time as I did.  Catch ya on the flipside, kiddies!

       You Know You Work In 2003 When...   (Generally I hate forwarded e-mails, but this one is written as if someone was watchign me in my office)  1. You accidentally enter your password on the microwave.   2. You haven't played solitaire with real cards in years.   3. You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of 3.   4. You e-mail your friend who works at the desk next to you.   5. Your reason for not staying in touch with friends is that they do not have e-mail addresses. (so true!)   6. When you go home after a long day at work you still answer the phone in a business manner   7. When you make phone calls from home, you accidentally dial "9" to get an outside line.   8. You've sat at the same desk for four years and worked for three different companies.   10. You learn about your lay-off on the 10 o'clock news.   11. Your boss doesn't have the ability to do your job.   12. Contractors outnumber permanent staff and are more likely to get long-service awards.   and the real clinchers are...  13. You read this entire list, and kept nodding and smiling.   14. As you read this list, you think about forwarding it to your "friends".    15. You got this e-mail from a friend that never talks to you anymore, except to send you jokes from the net.    16. You are too busy to notice there was no No. 9.

       Quick Morning Thoughts:   You know, I was going to write some big cryptic response to comments I heard about something, but I've realized its not worth it.  Thats petty and juvenile.  Personally, I am above that.  When someone is a different person every day of the week, or when its convenient to be something different it makes it hard to maintain a friendship.  I've learned that the hardway through a couple different friends.  I dont turn my back on them entirely, but there comes a point where I need to tell myself: enough of the bullshit, its never gonna right itsself no matter how many eggshells you walk on or how involved or indifferent you act towards it.    I am finally happy in life: I have great friends, I have an amazing boyfriend (who oddly enough is a friend, not just some random fly-by-night person who came out of nowhere), my family surrounds me and I have a job, which while I don't always love it, pays the bills.  I'm in the midst of starting my own business and the last week has seen gigantic leaps and bounds on that front, so that it  WILL  be a reality by January.  Thats not a wish, its a fact.    I also heard some awesome news about  urlLink one of my favorite Ohesians  (Congrats, hun!)  Finally I'd like to share one piece of advice I've learned from my Nana, and I've discovered as of late its true.  Now I can't word it as eloquent or sagely as she did, but I can give you the gist of it:  If you're going to be miserable and spend all your time complaining, bitching and just being miserable to people, you're going to find yourself surrounded by nothing but misery and poop.  If you take all that negative energy you're spreading and try to make it positive you'll realize that eventually all around you will start to become positive.  Take charge of your own life, don't bitch that you're victim to circumstance and you'll be able to "become who you were born to be"(my Nana didn't say that, but it fit with my schpeil).   Happy, Healthy, Safe & Lovely Thanksgiving to all of you guys and your families and friends.  May you be blessed with full bellies, warm beds to nap in afterwards and a delicious array of pies and deserts.  Take care, smooshies!

       SO ANGRY!!   Dear Expedia,  Fuck you for overcharging me by  $1,108.59  and only refunding me $660.59.  If you do your math properly, you'll realize you still owe me $448 fucking dollars, and because you took that extra money out you've caused me to already bounce 2 things that wouldn't have bounced if you didn't fuck up.  I sincerely hate you from the deepest depths of my blackened, disillusioned soul and I expect that you better cover me the $60 in overdraft fees that you made my bank charge me or else you're gonna have a war on your hands.  I was  really  looking forward to my big Vegas trip, but now I don't want to have anything to do with you.  Please go rot.  Rar.  Dieplz, Gwen

       Ranting & Rallying the Troops   As for the rally:   We need to start planning something for New Years Eve, stat!  I know that last year  urlLink Anna ,  urlLink Tazz  and I went to  urlLink Brother Jimmy's Bait Shack  for their NYE shindig.  It was prepaid admission of like $60 but it was all you could eat and drink (including the fishbowls of swampwater!), free party favors, groovable music, yummy bbq, a free champagne toast at midnite.  It was a blast, well worth the money.  Its strictly 21+ though, so this might be a problem to rally the whole group together, but worth it if you guys can scrounge up a fake in time.  We could also get a hotel room and all that fun stuff (I'm thinking something reminiscent of the February HardRock Shindig).  You all know how to get in touch with me by now so let me know what some suggestions are, it will surely be a blast!!!  For the rantings: 1.  This is America, speak English or get out, goddamnit! 2.  You're not helpless, stop trying to get everything for free, jerk. 3.  Ashley, stop this car crap right now.  Im sick of it.  Why is Chrysler calling me and asking me for my lawyers name and phone number when a) I dont have a lawyer and b) I'm not suing anyone?!?  You told me to write and sign an affidavit that you had to pick up on Sunday or else you would die.  I wrote it.  Where were you Sunday?  You never even called to double check.  Why am I busting my butt to settle this?  You told me you were going to settle this mess.  Forget your abusive boyfriend, now you're gonna have to answer to me.  Let me make something clear:  urlLink I intend to bring the pain.  4.  I hate everyone except for  urlLink The Don ,  urlLink Doogie  and Jeff C (no relation to  urlLink Sabrina_C ) cause they're the only ones who respect my authoritah as "she who is the provebial llamas pajamas. 5.  For the love of all things good and holy: hire me, please!

       Matrix Revolutions   I saw the Matrix Revolutions last nite like everyone else probably did and I have to say: I'm disappointed.  Now I know ther are gonna be people out there who are like "You just don't like it, 'cause you don't  get it " to you I say: "FUCK YOU!".  I got it, I got the Plato, I got the biblical references, I get it. I understand and have the ability to follow a plot, I can read into things and analyze them not on the "obvious" level.  That being said: aren't I allowed to feel disappointed that the movie didn't work out the way I wanted it?    I will say this: too preachy, too allegorical, too over the top with effects that could have been money spent elsewhere to make a better plotline.  Either its a KungFu, Shoot 'em up movie or its a preach fest: make up my mind.  I would like to go on record as saying if Sunday morning services were as action packed as Revoltions that would probably get attendance WAY up.    Its not just Revolutions that was so disappointing, it was also reloaded.  I think that the Wachowski's tried to hard to mass market and make a blockbuster that they lost sight of where they were going with the movie when it first came out.  They spoonfed you the obvious underlying ideas of Neo being "the one" etc.  how stupid do they think we are.  I dunno,  after rushing to see it last nite I feel I honestly could have waited.  Plus the theatre full of perps who were talking the whole time during an exchange between Neo and Trinity really kind of ruined the experience.  I KNOW that ROTK will not dissappoint, so I'll go out like a super fan girl to check that out and the bang for my holiday blockbuster buck will have been met.    One last thought:  dunno if we all got the same previews but I really want to see a)  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  and b)  urlLink Troy.   Troy looks fuckin' awesome.  As for the preview for  urlLink Torque : I liked it better when it was called "Fast and the Furious".

       I Need A Vacation   I really need a freakin'' vacation.  Ideally I'd like to go back to the Caribbean on a  urlLink cruise , that was a blast and the water and scenery and weather was just amazing.  Its not that I haven't been having fun, but I just need to get out of the area for a while.  I'm feeling really weird.  Montreal was a nice and well needed break, I just wish it had been a little longer.     urlLink The Bride  and  urlLink groom  from the wedding we attended this weekend are going to Turks & Caicos for their honeymoon.  I wish I could stow away in their suitcases.  I'm also thinking that since my last 2 birthdays (21st & 22nd) were so C R A P P Y that I'd go on vacation for my 23rd birthday just so I don't have to be disappointed by other people's crap.    Does anyone have any good suggestions for places that are tropical and warm and not exorbitantly priced for a vacation?  Also, please bear in mind that I absolutely HATE flying and I live on the eastern coast of the U.S. so I'm near major transportation hubs (like the 79th street Boat Basin in Manhattan).

       So Yeah   Neither the myself nor the Don has blogged in a few days.  We like suck, and stuff.  So here it is:  I'm updating.  I had a great weekend of parties with friends, manicures and naps...oh yeah and a tasty assed lunch at Black Bear Saloon (c:  Only two more days at work until some more time off, I can make it, I promise...I'll tough it out.  Tomorrow starts my pre-NYE attempt at quitting smoking so I don't have to go cold turkey on Thursday morning.  I can do it.  Its easy, I'm just lazy, so since its another resolution to not be so lazy, I should be able to make it ok.  If I could sum up the year 2003 in one word it would be the following:  conjunctivitis-esque .  Yes, thats a word, Fuckers.  Anyhow, I got pink eye or pink eye like symptoms about six times this year.   urlLink It all started in February when I bought my Olsen Twins bath pouf  and I got it FIVE times since then.  What the hell.  I woke up Saturday A.M. all pink and itchy again.  What happened Friday night?  I finally threw out the Olsen's Bath Pouf (yes, I was smart enough to  not  use it) and the next day I wake up with pink eye.  I tell you, they're on a mission to ruin my vision, those little tramps.    Peace out, Cub Scouts!

       The Last Days of Nancy Negative   Well kids, its that time of the year where we reflect back on the year and try and decide what we will try to do better in the next year.  So here it is in all its glory, my new year's resolution:  I am going to be a positive, successful and accomplished person.  It seems lofty, and frankly I'm a little scared of it myself, but I can and  will  do it.  I learned a few very valuable lessons this year and I want to share them with you so that you guys can reach your own personal goals and aspirations for 2004 (sorry if this seems preachy).  1)  Words give things power.   If you say negative things consistently then you will be awash in a sea of negativity and in turn only attract negative people (opposite attraction generally only works for magnets).  Conversely, if you set a list of goals for yourself and want to accomplish some positive things.  Write them down, read them to yourself once or twice a day, really focus on them.  Allow your words to give your goals power.    2) Winners win, because they're willing to do what losers aren't.   Sounds simple and stupid right?  Right!  Its that easy to make a change though, pick up the slack where someone drops it, even if no one else is doing it, you'll advance yourself further and while it may not pay off immediately, trust me, people will notice that you're willing get stuff done and by time they realize it works, you'll be leaps and bounds ahead of them.  3) If you're not growing, you're dying.   Make yourself better.  Read for 30 minutes a day, get up at the same time everyday just to establish a habbit, hit the gym even though you  really  don't want to.  Once you start doing this stuff enough it will become second nature to you and the tasks you've set for yourself that seemed impossible and unattainable will become closer and easier to reach because you're thinking positively and going and growing in the right direction.  We all have the inner potential to be that amazing person with the great carreer, family life and social life who is always making positive changes and positive things happen who we all envy and just wonder how they do it, all we have to do is tap into it and if we all grow just a little bit we'll unlock part of ourselves that will allow us to reach that potential.  4) Look out for yourself and take care of yourself, even spoil yourself, if you don't chances are no one else will either.   Its good to reward yourself for the small progresses you make.  Set goals and measure yourself against them.  Even though you'll already have the plus of reaching a goal, you can give yourself a small incentive to get rolling on the rest of your tasks you've set.  5) A positive outlook goes a long way.   Sure, people are gonna look at you funny at first, but I promise you, positivity catches on.  If you want to surround yourself with a good growing environment just emit positivity, its like a pebble in a pond, eventually it will ripple out.  6) Don't be a "should-head"   "I Should do this...."  "I should do that..." JUST DO IT!  Let me put it in nerdier terms for those of you who are in touch with your inner geeks:  "Do or do not, there is no try".  Finally, I encourage you all to pick up a book called  Reach Your True Potential: How to Overcome Self-Defeating Behavior  by Sheri Zampelli, it will change some of your lives.  Laugh at me if you wish, but these are my honest goals for the year that is rapidly approaching.  I've sold out to the power of self improvement and I guess this is my first step towards seeing if it really works.  I have 8 more days of bitching and moaning left for the year so buckle your seatbelts for that, but after January 1st I'm going to try and turn over a new leaf.    See ya on the flipside, kids!

       Oh My Fucking God   When you're trying to "take care of personal business" its a good idea to close all the porn on your computer when you're done so that when you're chilling out on you're bed later just rummaging trhough your mail and your mom walks in your room she doesn't look at your monitor and go "What the HELL is that?" referring to the picture of a vagina with a tounge on it on your screen.  Then you wont have to make up some excuse about how some guy you know sent you an email telling you it was a "funny" picture and you opened that.    Im going to be in the corner killing myself now, thanks...

       Patience4tehwin!      I have wanted the "Vertical Stripe Scarf" from  urlLink The Gap  since it came out this fall.  However, if I bought a $40 scarf my boyfriend would beat the everliving piss out of me (see previous references to my $30 coach keyfob...it was a JACK RUSSELL!).  Anyhow, the price finally dropped to $20 and it was nowhere to be found cause all the crackpots like me want it.  This morning I spent 1 hour at work calling all the Gaps in a 15 mile radius (thats 12 gaps for those of you not in the know).  Finally, Linda, the glorious little elf at the Gap in Rye, NY had it.  Its on hold for me, and today, it shall be mine...well, Christmas morning after mommy gives it to me it shall be mine.  Wooooooooooooooooo!

Why is it that in order for me to ever get space/quiet/peace/serenity/alone time in my life I have to come out swinging and acting like an insensitve bitch?

       Blizzard Part 2: Snowy Boogaloo   So I opened my front door at 5 p.m. a mere 6 hours after I had previously been outside shoveling.  What did I find when I opened the door?  Snow that was piled at least six inches high.  There is a step up to get in my front door which is completely covered and now the snow is piling up the door:    Just so you guys can really get an idea of how nuts it is this is where my mother and I were standing earlier.  You could clearly see where the driveway was and snowlevels there, but now, its just as high if not higher.  Rar!    It does look pretty, and serene, but I'm *SO* not looking forward to dealing with it tomorrow...

       My Big Fat New England Blizzard     This is a big fuck you to the wintertime in my area.  So far in the unshoveled areas, the snow is up to my knee.  The lovely bitches at the weather center are telling us that we're supposed to get between an additional 12 to 18 inches of snow.  FUCK THAT!  This sucks.  (Also, I'm not really this fat, I have lots of layers on...so shut your mouth!)  This is me and my mommy oustide shoveling.  We had to do the whole driveway by ourselves becuase my brother is a lazy pot smoking monkey who is upstairs and still asleep at between 9 a.m. and  11 a.m.    If you don't think my driveway is that long so it shouldn't be that hard...think again.  We're gonna pool money next time and get a fuckin' plow dude to come.    Even if we could save our money we wouldn't be able to get a plow guy here anyhow cause my town does such a shitty job plowing roads and now they've had to declare a state of emergency so no one can drive anywhere...      Thats it for now, I am only goign to get more angry and more stircrazy (mmm....stircrazy) as the day goes on.  Anyone know where's nice in Arizona or somewhere warm that I can move to??  I'll even settle for Texas.  A r g h !   I hate the winter.

Freaky weatherman,  urlLink Jim Castillo , told me that we would have 3 inches on the ground for the commute to work which would start mixing with sleet and freezing rain.  Where is  urlLink Nick Gregory  when we need him, Fox 5?  All I have to say is that it better start snowin' A.S.A.P. and close my job early so that I can just go home and nap, othwise it's gonna be Jim Castillo's cross-eyed head!

Are people really that bored with life that they need to be screwing stuff up for me?  Can anyone just learn to GET OVER IT!  Furthermore, can people get over themselves and leave me alone?  Am I not 22 and capable of living my own freaking life?  Aren't you in love with someone and having this big "emotional connection" with them, so big in fact, that you're MOVING TO BE NEAR THEM?!?!  Of course you are, so why do you care what goes on in my life?!?!

       Don't Count Your Chickens Before They Hatch...      So yesterday everyone on all the news channels were telling us that the world is gonna blow up with snow and we're all gonna die and have to live in igloos and eat one another.  So in anticipation of this I stayed up til 2 a.m. drinking, laughing, watching movies and having snowball fights with everyone.  A treacherous adventure to McDonalds was a fun time thanks to  urlLink Aidan, my trusty Pathfinder  and it brought tasty treats to the whole apartment.    Once Upon A Time In Mexico was a pretty decent flick (a lil gory if I do say so myself), but I dunno if it was worth all those Miller Lite burps or the fact that I'm running on no sleep wahtsoever in order to be here at work today.  And for what?  No one is even here anyhow (well except the FabUlous Twan) and I did score points b.c I saw my cool boss walking to work and I stopped and picked her up.  It was pretty good in that respect.  Now I've got a stomach ache and Im cranky though.  Oh well only 2 hrs left to go before I can go home and get my nap on.

       Mystery Solved...Kinda   You may remember my trip to Montreal last October.  Well on that trip I mentioned that we had stopped at  urlLink Stewart's Shops  and stumbled upon a very strange flavor of soda called "Vichy".  Now, you're prolly asking yourself the same thing we were "What the hell is a Vichy"?  Well, it wasn't seltzer water, it wasn't a citrus, it wasn't even tonic water or gingerale-ish (though it did come in a green bottle).  The  urlLink Stewart's  label didn't even offer much in the way of description.    This weekend on the trek home from snowboarding we stopped at Stewart's again.  We brought the bottle to the register and asked the kindly Saugerties native (with his three glorious, shiny teeth) what exactly is Vichy.  With a look that was a mixed bag of disgust, contempt and disbelief at our "lower New York" stupidity he said " What's Vichy?!?!  It's like club soda."  It was so matter of fact that we felt so ashamed and stupid for even having asked.  We stewed in our feelings of disappointment for a few moments as we walked silently to the car.  After a good laugh about how shocked he was that we weren't in the know about "Vichy" we stumbled upon the next of life's seltzery mysteries: what is the difference between Club Soda, Tonic Water and Seltzer?  Will we ever get to the bottom of this?

       Spatastic...and Other Happenings      "Let me ask you something: am I dating the female me?  Like me, but as a girl?" - Seth Cohen   Anyhow yesterday I spent one of the best days I have in a while, at the  urlLink Spa  with my bestest girlie, Lisa.  She was treated like some food with a sugar scrub, a milk bath and a shea butter massage so she's nice and smooth and luxurious.  I treated myself to a milk bath and a Desert Stone massage.  Let me tell you, I've had massages before, but with these smooth hot oiled stones gliding over your skin it was nothing short of pure excstasy.  While he was giving me the foot massage, Joe, the masseuse, also almost gave me an orgasm.  My feet are very sensitive on the bottom and whatever he was doing was so incredible and sexual in a non sexual way its getting me excited to write about it now.  He wasn't hot at all, but it was one of the most sexual experiences I have ever had.    We followed up our massages with some makeup shopping at  urlLink Sephora  (like I needed an excuse to go there!!) and some good old fashioned girl talk and yummy chinese lunchies at  urlLink P.F. Chang's China Bistro .  It was great to spend so much time with her, I've missed her and she's been closer location-wise than ever and we just never took advantage of it.  (c:  I have to say, the OC is so fucking good.  Watch it.  Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) is (to borrow a term from the Don) "adoobly" and I want to date him.  (le sigh).    I had an awesome weekend.  Friday night I was very nicely treated to a dinner at  urlLink Eclisse  and then I rocked out with everyone and early Saturday morning in the NEGATIVE TWO degree temperature I headed out with Andrew for some snowboarding.  We went to  urlLink Hunter Mountain  and it was freezing and windy, but it was a great time.  I dropped my board off to get a quick tune up (some fresh wax and sharpen the edges) so I won't be so dead the next time this season we hit the slopes.  Also if anyone has any good exercises for strengthening your upper legs  (BESIDES SQUATS!! I HATE SQUATS)  please drop me an email or a comment.  I finished Monday night up with some kickboxing and I feel so amped about it, becuase I love going in there and just getting all my aggression out.  If I hadn't taken that spill on Saturday and hurt my elbow I would have been able to go full on grudge match mode when we were alternating right & left jabs & hooks.  Oh well, theres always Wednesday.

       A Strange New World       Last night the Don & I discovered the Kumquat.  Now we're not sure waht they taste like, though from what we've read we see they're citrusy.  We plan on procuring some for further investigation.  We'll report back with any findings.  For the mean time we'll just obsess amongst ourselves about Kumquats and the pachachi.

       Reality Check   My brother's best friend in the entire world died Thursday night in his sleep.  They found him 15 hours later.  No one that my brother knows has ever died, not a friends parent, not a friend, not a grandparent...nothing.  Now, he has to be pallbearer for his 19 year old best friend.  Our family is very, very close with theirs and everything is very confusing and scary right now.  My mother is a wreck because she is scared for my brother.  I am too.  Lately he's been hanging with the wrong people, smoking a lot of pot, speeding in excess of 100+ mph on the highway and totaling his car.  I hope this is his wake up call and not a push over the edge.  I hope he can right himself before he destroys himself.  I have never been more scared than I am right now.  Im scared that my brother is next and I can't even start to think or type or talk about what the consequences of that would be.    Peggy, the boy's mother, is devastated and rightly so.  She and my mom are very, very close and my mom just keeps crying and shaking because she doesn't know what to do to help Peggy in this time.  I'm scared for everyone around me and I feel like I don't want to do anything because I don't want to lose any of the time I have left with everyone.  I don't mean for this to sound dramatic and drama queeny, becuase its not meant like that.  For the last month I have been having these thoughts and trying to push them aside and I can't and all my thoughts are so morbid and I keep just going out so I don't have to sit home and think about losing these people.  I know I don't know what anyone goes through when something like this happens, becuase I've been fortunate to not have it happen to me, but it doens't make me less scared for you and scared to lose the people I love whether it be friends or family.  I don't like seeing people I care about hurt and I dont like not being able to help.  I dont want to push my way into your life to try and do what *I* think is gonna help you.  What do I know?  I've never been in your shoes, I couldn't even imagine if I tried.    The older I get the faster the time is going and the more people around me are starting to pass away.  Is this what a life is about?  Is life about watching all this time you could use to be effective wizz by you at some desk job and not taking advantage of it.  Is it about not letting people close to your heart so it will hurt less when you lose them?  No, of course its not, but to live the opposite way of that and let people in and try to not waste time is so scary.  I want to let you all know (and you know who you are) that I love you all very much and I cherish you all as friends and people and though we all make each other nuts sometimes its what makes us a family.

       Its The Little Things...   That always seem to make me smile, like reading over a long email from someone or the anticipation of drinks and a night on the town with my girlies, a long hot bath with some good tunes crankin' and only candles to light the room, maybe even just snuggling with my kitties.  I dunno I feel so at peace right now its amazing.  My life has the potential to go in a million different directions and instead of being stressed like I used to get over "not knowing" I'm excited, just going with whatever happens to see what comes next.  For the last 3 years I've been under this dilluded impression that I was supposed to be responsible and have this big office job that's gonna mean something.  I have wasted so much time skipping out on adventures and being young because I thought I was being responsible.  To hell with that.  The only person I have any responsiblity to is myself so without further ado I'm gonna go out and be happy already.  So, if you're along for the ride, cool if not, I hope our paths cross again someday and best of luck to you in the interim.

       Dear Work,      The least you could have done was at least give us a delay.  The roads are treacherous and otherwise shitty.  No one is gonna come to the building to conduct business today and if they do I will pelt them with things.  I hope you're happy that you've forced everyone to come in.  If it continues to snow and you're not gonna let us out early you lose your cool status, even if you did work for the Gemini space program.  Rar.  This is not how we start the day.    Kthxdie, Gwen

       It's All Happening   Some pretty good times have been being had lately.  Lots of fun people, lots of silly raps & greeting cards, some Mario Kart Double Dash (Toadetteandbabyluigi4thewin!), some beers, some party balls, some rounds of Kings all making for a great time.  Sprinkle in some Stongbad emails and some cute boys and can you go wrong?  I sumbit that you cannot.    My vegas trip has been postponed becuase of "outside" circumstances, but its all good in the hood, I'm either going to use my airline credit to go to Washington (the state not the district) to visit some friends or to go to Vegas with some other friends.  I'm prolly going to end up going to Washington though, because that will require the least money (no airfare cost, no lodging cost, minimal food costs) where as Vegas will be much $$, not to mention I have to a) save for Eurpoe with Anna and b) start paying my debt off so I can quit my job at the end of August.  Did you say quit your job?  Right you are, Ken!  I have made a huge decision in my life.  I am in the process of applying to  urlLink The University Of Connecticut  to go back to school full time as a day student and finish my bachelor's degree in English like I've always wanted to.  My plan is to sell my car for something I can afford a lil more easily and work thru til the end of August paying off as much of my $10k debtload as possible so that I can take some measly part time Starbucks-y job and continue to live at home rent free and finally finish my degree.  If I have to take student loans to do that, so be it, but I prioritized my life finally and finishing school is important to me, jerkin' off all night long at my community college isn't cutting it.  So I ask over the next few weeks and months as I go thru the application process that you all keep your fingers and toes crossed for me that I am accepted again (I'm not applying for housing as its a commuter campus), but I will finally finish what I started in September, 1999, graduate from the University of CT.  I should have been a member of the graduating class of May, 2003, but alas my one semester stint didn't help me accomplish that.  I am older, wiser and ready to just do this already so I can and  will  get it done.  The scariest thing in doing all of this is telling my mom.  I dont want her to think I'm a disappointment.  I know she will be happy I'm gonna go all the way and really finish school, but I can't handle a full time 8-4 job and then school on top of that.  At this point in my life a degree is more important to me and I will do what it takes to get it, but while I can afford to take the "normal" route there (schooling full days and workign PT around that) I would like to.    This was all just kind of one giant brain fart, but thanks for reading.  Go, Huskies!

       Wild On:  The Grocery Store    urlLink Twan  prompted the Don and I into discussing the following:  The things I would wanna do if I could have free reign to run around and do whatever the fuck I wanted to in a supermarket (empty or open)    Twan suggested:  1.) Tearing thru boxes of Oreo's with teeth only, no hands  2.) Rubbing Porkchops on my underarms  3.) Orange Juice Slip&Slides  4.) Spelling out words on the floor with Squeezable Jelly    I said:  1) Take all the lobsters out of the tank and snip off their bands so they could have "Lobster Fight Club"  2) Set up all the TP and Papertowels at the end of a aisle and go cart surfing into the squishy pile  3) Spray the floor down with pam or butter and slide around ala Risky Business  4) Create sculptures w. squeeze cheese and various assorted things that would stick toghether.  5) Create a giant people sized litterbox with the cat litter 6) Chopped meat sculpture    The Don adds:  1) Set up all the TP in the store and sit atop a giant castle to rule with an Iron 2ply Fist.  2)Take all the bubbleicious in the store and chew it and make the biggest gumwad ever  3) Tampons plus bottled water pluss rubber bands = Darts on the stores front glass dont need rubber bands really jsut a good toss  4)fill garbage can with pudding and then sit in it  5)New Ky with heated action slip and slide  6) chicken or turkey bowling wiht liters of milk set up as pins  7) mop sword fights  8) last is conveyor belt treadmill  Now we turn to you, our jungle friends...what would  you  do given free reign in the supermarket??

       S T R E S S & Then Some Good Stuff   So today, the fabulous  urlLink Twan  and I were supposed to have a meetings all day and at lunch time we were supposed to give a presentation to the First Selectman (our name for our Mayor) about the project we've been working hardcore on.  Alas, Twan has called out today, which is a little aggrivating.  He has extenuating family issues, but I think he is prolly just gonna sleep all day.  If he called out tomorrow, it wouldn't be so bad, but today's lunch meeting is what will be the worst.  The other 2 I can handle no problem.  I guess I should becareful going around saying "oh I don't mind the stress, I work best under pressure..."  Onto the okay stuff.  Yesterday I became  urlLink Hester Prynne  for a brief moment in time.  I ended up working it all out and it turns out that I was the only person who acutally got in trouble for anything, but I realized a) I haven't done anything wrong, so I'm in the clear, b) anyone in my position would have been treated the same by this person and c) I don't really give 2 shits what the person who's mad at me thinks as they've not got a leg to stand on as far as their argument goes.  So yesterday at Kickboxing class I really went into "grudge-match" mode as Cory would say.  I pretented to punch and kick and double kick this person in their woochata so much that it broke open like a pinata spilling its contents on the floor.    In light of all of the drama of yesterday certain situations have become a little less stressful/akward so thats kind of cool.  A non dramatic  urlLink Ruckus  can be brought and everything will become "ruckusified" and thats cool.  For the record:  urlLink Bex  makes rockin' chocolate chip cookies.  Not only is she a master pup tent builder, but she's a cookie chef extrordinaire.  Underworld is a pretty kick ass movie and certain people are just as klutzy as me.  Its funny.  Finally, when  urlLink something  in your life is stressful and you're sick of talking yourself in circles about it and people start running their mouths too much, its delightful to employ the use of this delightful feature AIM has called 'block'....it truly makes life great.    That about does it for this entry.  Make sure to check back on the 16th for my 1 Year Blogaversary and my State of the Diva Address.  Catch ya on the flipside, childrens.

       Woo Hoo!   Quoth the lovely  urlLink Anna :  "This summer, New York City's most eligible bachelorette will join Greenwich's most eligible bachelorette on a trip to PARIS fuckin FRANCE. This will be directly following our spring break trip to Las Vegas.  It's time to take action. I guess with all the hair and body stuff Ive done and now this, it's safe to say my mothers death has affected me in the sense that, hey, you only live once, and Im gunna do everything I want to do, Im gunna find a way, and Ive found a way to do this, so Gwen and I will make short stops in Italy, England, and Spain, and then vacation with bagettes, hot men and the Eifel Tower. "   This changes things...My new to do list: 1. Lose 20 lbs by April (thanks to kickboxing I can do it) 2. Go shopping for  real  binkis with Anna for Vegas. 3. Polish up on my french and spanish and try to learn Italian.  I've got the important basics down for France and Spain (Voulez vous coucher avec moi? and Dame un beso), just need to learn something flirty in Italian.

I've decided the internet is no longer the abounding happy playplace that it once was and so I leave this blog in the capable hands of the Don.  Maybe I'll pop in from time to time to give y'all a guest post, but if you know where to look you'll prolly find me.  Behave and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

You better go listen to them.  Now, damn it!   N extel.  My cellphone.  Its bleepy and fabu.  If only I could steal my brother's i730 then it woudl be sooooo perfect.  (Insert wierd Gollum "my precious" impression here).   O dyssey, The.  By Homer.  My favorite book of all time probably...well, except mabye for the Divine Comedy.  Seriously though, the Odyssey has it all, adventures, monsters, heroism, love.  Don't be an ignoramus.  Read it.   P iglet.  Thats basically me.  He's cute, lil, pink and has the best lil quotes like "Its hard to be brave when you're only a very small animal."  So so cute.   Q uotes.  I love quotes.  I have an entire book of quotes that I've collected over the years.  They're good for inspiring you to jumpstart your life, or inspire a painting or a written piece.  As of late my life has been filled with some pretty hysterical quotes thanks to Tim, Timmem, Ru, Gozar and Bill.   R olling Rock.  My latest beer of choice though, Magic Hat #9 is my favorite of all time.   S ushi & Sephora.  My favorite food and my favorite store.  If only there was a way to combine the two.....hmmmm.  I'll have to get the institute to work on this.   T attoos.  I have 3 of them.  I need one more but I want 2 more (to make 5 total).  Its hard to stop gettign them once you've started.  They're an addiction like crack.   U Conn.  My school!  Woo.  Awesome at 'hoops and just all around an awesome school.  Go Huskies!   V alentine's Day.  Wretch!  I hate this day more than any other lame ass, corny, made up holiday.  I hate chocolate, I hate stuffed animals and I generally don't like flowers (unless they're pink roses or those white ones tipped w. pink).  This day and all it stands for is an abomination and I'd take a nice homecooked meal over a nite out in an overcrowded restaurant with the prices jacked up to 3x what they should be.  So this year for Valentine's Day me and my Valentine are gonna snowboard and then head to Burger King where we'll don crowns and mock everyone else.   W estchester.  Best.mall.ever.  It has a Sephora, Nordstroms, Elizabeth Arden Spa.  An apple store, J. Crew, Aldo, Steve Madden, Coach, BCBG and a million other great stores.  Plus they have good sushi in the food court.  Holllllaaaaaaaaaaa!   X treme.  As in Most eXtreme Elimination Challenge. (or as Bex calls it: The Japanese Show Where People Swing From Corn).  So great.  I wanna be on it hardcore.    Y es!  Only 1 more to go!  (Sure this was a copout, but let's see you come up with something)   Z elda The Ocarina Of Time.  Best video game ever.  Even if it is for N64.  Wow,  this was acutally a lot harder than it looks.  I doubt anyone read this far, but if you did cool.  You get a gold star for the day.

       All Rested Up   Sleeping from 4:30p.m. until 6:30 a.m. is where its at.  I feel like a million bucks!   I had a pretty great weekend this weekend.  It started Friday night with a yummy dinner at  urlLink Boxcar Cantina  and then we all headed over to the Apartment where we watched Wargames (OMG!  Bill, there is a Pterodactyl in ths movie!!!).  Matthew Broderick got really hot between WarGames and Ferris Bueller.  Thank God for some things, I suppose.  I wasn't really in the mood to drink and a shot of Black Haus didn't really help the cause.  I called it kind of an early night and hit the hay.  Saturday was nice to sleep in without waking up feeling sick.  Ru and I went to lunch at Applebees and then to Chez Target.  I managed to get out of the store a) only spending $25 and b) not purchasing anything for myself.  It was a miracle if I do say so.  If you ever wanna buy funny birthday cards Target is defintiley the place to do that.  I finally picked up my board from Princeton and its nice and sharp and waxy and tuned so that was exciting.  I have been running ideas thru my head as to how I want to have the top of the deck painted b/c I'm too cheap to buy a new ride so I'm gonna just continue to use this one.  I ran home for dinner and some hella yummy cake for my grampy's birthday (he's so smooshy and spry for someone who's 77).  Later that night we got everyone together and watched the NHL AllStar Game Skills Competition which was very entertaining.  (Is it just me or is  urlLink Martin St.Louis  freakin' beautiful?!?!)  Bex got slaughtered in Madden (106 to 14 at the half?!?!), went out to  urlLink Turtle  for some drinking (well, a lot  of drinking) and some drama.  I came face to face with PeterPan.  She didn't stab my eyeballs out, but we've agreed that we don't like each other, have said it to one another and we are going to be civil in public because we have many mutual friends.  I can't wait for April when she'll finally have moved away.  Anyhow, there was more drama because Ashley showed up and that was a little ridiculous, but I finally got to drink with the lovely and always insane Twan, gave some lapdances to Bex, yelled at Tim to stop talking to my mom and though I may have gotten the beer tears a lil, I didn't yak, so woo for me for holding my booze!  To bed at 5 a.m., not a bad nite.    Sunday morning: not pretty.  Not dehydrated, but REALLY bad headache.  Me, Ru, Bex and Tim went to the Greenwich Diner where we saw the evil greaseface from high school with her other nasty friend.  They ended up asking Bex 'who  are  you (as we'd seen them out last weekend) and she goes "you ex boyfriend's new girlfreind" (though she's not).  It was mad funny, she's a champ, that girl.  After that we went to KayBee Toys and contemplated buying a McFlurry machine and a witch's hat.  We used our better judgement and passed on both though.  We watched the actual all star game on sunday afternoon which was exciting.  I ate some dinner and then Bex and I headed out to the boy's game.  They were winning 4 to 3 with 20 seconds left in the game (thanks to 2 goals by Tim and some awesome saves by Ru) and then the other team tied it up.  Bex and I were unsure as to what would come next.  Would they leave it as a draw because it wasn't playoffs yet?  No, that wouldn't be nervewracking enough for me and Becki.  Instead it was  a frickin' shootout .  This is  VERY  stressful to watch when your there cheering people on!  Ru made 4 good saves and they finally got one in on him, but then it was Tim's turn to answer with his shot and he scored too (for a hat-trick I might add!).  Ru made another great save and the next guy up on the Rink Rats (the boy's team) made it in.  They won 6-5.  Wooo!  Bex and I went on a mission for cheeseballs and orange cupcakes which brought us all across P.C. with no luck.  We finally settled on a snackmix and some twinkees and BK for us.  Back to the Apt. for the end of the ProBowl and some more Madden and before I knew it it was 1 a.m. and I headed home.  All in all, pretty awesome weekend, just wish I had more time to sleep.

In all fairness to me: I have slept for about 8 hours collectively out of the last 72 hours so thats why I'm looking a lil ragged in the face.  Other than that enjoy.  Then there is me in my spiffy new roxy hat (which isn't as new as the red hair)  **edit: I'm a genius b.c you can't even see how hardcore my hat is, but whateva!**

So I don't have to apply for admission, I just have to get reinstated.  I have to fill out a form and tell them what I've been doing for the last few years.  There is one small catch still, but I think I have that covered as well.  Keep your fingers and toes and paws crossed, please!  Weeeee!

I'm not going to fight you because that is sad and silly and not worth my time (besides I'm a kickboxing champion)  In conclusion:  Diva: 1 P.Pan: 0  P.S. I look pretty hot for a chick with a hook, if I do say so myself.

       Exploring the Blogosphere    urlLink Gary's  post the other day about the "Six Degrees of a Blogger Nation" got me thinking.  If you look on my sidebar and my links to other blogs its an interesting mix of people.  Most of these people are people I know...they're other whiny twenty-somethings like me, just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in their lives.    Some, like  urlLink Liz  are using their blogs as a journal for personal reflection and to get people on board with their cause.  (Liz and Gary, by the way, are both participating in the  urlLink Avon Walk  to raise money and awareness about breast cancer, go check out their sites and donate, you'll feel warm and fuzzy inside).   urlLink Cacoa , isn't even from the U.S., we're not of the same ethnic or even religious background and still I feel like I can relate to her on a lot of levels.  She's in the midst of a time of self discovery and sorting through everything and I'm not sure precisely what it is, but something about that really strikes a chord with me.  There are M.W.B (mom's who blog), like  urlLink Tina ,  urlLink Judy  and  urlLink Becca , sometimes they talk about their kids, most of the time though, they're just awesome, witty people.  (Not that kids don't make you awesome).   I've got my Ron & Fez friends, my girlie  urlLink my girlie: Anna , some awesome chicks like  urlLink Petrina ,  urlLink Sabrina ,  urlLink Diana ,  urlLink Heather  and  urlLink Shanti  whose sarcasm and sense of humor will make you die laughing.    There are blogs I stumbled upon through reading other people's blogs like  urlLink MadPony ,  urlLink Kzug ,  urlLink LameKing , and  urlLink Completing the Square .  Perhaps most interesting of all of these though is  urlLink Autopsy Report , the blog of a medical student doing their summer internship at the morgue.  Its really interesting, but creepy at the same time.    Most of the blogs I've come across though are because of the one and only, the legend:  urlLink The Boz .  Boz is from Michigan, I've never met him, I do like his moustache, he cracks me up and I enjoy his nonsense.  Plus, he was one of the first non "friend" people to leave a comment on my blog, so for that, he gets the points, plus he's a June baby and made me angel of the month for June too.  Through Boz, I found  urlLink Jonnie  the roaming gnome of the blog world.  He's lived in Vegas, Alaska, California, he knows a schizophrenic McGuyver and he's cute to boot.    Its funny though I don't know half of these people, I've become obsessed with the inconsequential details of their lives.  I look forward every day to reading about what's going on with them or what they've got to rant about.  Its exciting.  In reading I've seen one blogger get married in a secret ceremony of sorts, two people fall in love in Manhattan (though neither is from there),  urlLink a cat  have a cancer scare, and a myriad of other triumphs and tradgedies.  Who says nothing on the internet is real?  Who thought it was possible to find people so scattered and whose lives are so different that you can still relate to?  The little blogospher is a pretty damn cool place if I do say so myself.

       Weekend Recap   It was a good weekend.  I went to Toys 'R Us with Andrew while waiting for our dinner from the  urlLink Outback  to be cooked.  I stumbled upon the GREATEST thing ever: a new  urlLink Rainbow Brite doll!  and it even came with her sprite, Twink.  Now all I wan to get is Starlite so I can be seven years old again.  Rainbow brite is my all time favorite 80's thing ever, so needless to say I was super stoked.  We went and saw Jersey Girl and as I previously mentioned in the Don's comments, it was really good.  You all should definitely get out to check it out.  Saturday we went to the car wash and to  urlLink Costo  for chorish stuff we had to get done, and then we met up with Billy to go to lunch at Applebee's, which was yummy and since it was such a beautiful day we met up with Bex and all cruised around in Bill's mom's convertible.  It was a lot of fun, except for Bex's death-defying attempting to climb into the front seat with me while we're on the highway and she only weighs 3 lbs. and will get blown away.  After we watched  urlLink UConn  make their way to the Final Four, Andrew decided to cook dinner.  It was yummy steak and biscuits (muffins, whatever) and rice and string beans.  Lemme tell ya, the boy can cook.  Certainly cooks better than me, but to be fair even a retarded chimp with glaucoma and one arm could cook better than me.  Ice cream was gotten with Todd and Melissa and then we all came back to the apartment and watched Event Horizon.  I was a little disappointed.  I remember seeing the movie when it first came out in theatres and being scared poopless.  Not so much that its scary, but the concept of it is fucked up.  Execution of said concept was pretty poor though.  I just liked it because at the time I was crushin' hardcore on Jack Noseworthy who had recently ended his stint on MTV's Dead at 21.  (Okay, I know it wasn't a good show, but gimme a break, he was hawt!)  After only seeing the Alien Quadrilogy for the first time in December 2003 I've come to realize that almost every space movie has ripped it off in some way shape or form, be it sets, plotlines, etc.  Sunday I headed home and got girlie with my mom and grandma as we got our manicures and pedicures and I visited the spa for a quick trip.  I finally managed to almost entirely clean my room (all i have left to do is take out trash and make the bed, hollaaaaaa!) I ate a totally yummy dinner with my family and then went to watch Andrew in action in his hockey game.  He did a great job and his team plays really well together.  I have to tell ya: shut-outs are pretty sexy.  (c:  I hope all of you enjoyed your weekends as well.  Hopefully I'll get some pics of how hardcore Rainbow Brite is!  Peace out, kids!

       Stranded for a Moment on the Ocean of Osyrus   I feel like a lame duck.  No, not  urlLink  that   lame duck.  I mean I know I am leaving this job to go to back to  urlLink school , but I haven't told them yet, and I haven't gotten the entire ball of wax rollin' on the whole scheduling thing for work so I feel sort of stuck here.  I'm not motivated to do much here, because I know come July 1st (yes, I pushed up the date) I'll be outta here, but at the same time I'm so bored that I feel obligated to at least do  something .    In a weird way I feel like I'm falling into some sort of a rut, I'm not sure if its good or bad, but my life seems to be the same thing everyday now: wake up at 6:30, drive home, shower, work, track with Billy, go home, shower and possibly eat at home, go to the boy's apartment, rinse and repeat.  Its fun and all, but I definitley think its gonna result in me ending up lazy and fat again.  Maybe its just because I'm getting a little stir crazy and I need to be out and about come spring.  Maybe I need to hang out with some of my other friends every once in a while.  Well, I  do  see Adam weekly, but everyone else is left behind.  Who knows.

       Gee, Thanks   People in my office have taken to playing Emma for me (yes, very much like  urlLink the Kool-Aid Man has done for Doogie ).  I walk in this morning, barely 8 o'clock, I haven't even had my first cup of coffee.  Anne, the office manager, comes up to me and says "I have a personal question for you."  Instantly I panick and start to wonder what on earth it could be.  "Uh, yes?"  "Are you seeing anyone?  Becuase you know I have this friend whose son would be  perfect  for you.  He's really smart and funny and oh, he's good looking.  I told him all about you last night, he's looking forward to meeting you."  "Well, I'm seeing someone.  Almost 2 months now.  He's really great."  "Oh..."  Last week one of my mother's friends who works here tried to set me up with one of the building maintenance guys.  He's really nice and kind of cute, but where you all of you people in December when I was single?

       Woah, Isn't That Random   Okay so I'm in the shower this morning and I randomly start humming this weird song.  I don't know where I know it from and so it really starts annoying me.  I  urlLink google  some of the lyrics and it turns out its an old slave song and then I start to remember this one time when I was in either 3rd or 4th grade that I had to do this weird project.  My mom brings me to school on a Saturday and there are just about 15 of us kids sitting around.  They read us a book called   urlLink Follow The Drinking Gourd  .  Its a book about the Underground Railroad.  Then they teach us this song and we have to sing it and the whole time its being filmed.  At the end of the singing and dancing they bring us into a room and they give us some  urlLink Martinelli's Apple Juice  (I remember because they have a cool lil jug) and some of those Danish butter cookies.  After all of this we are asked questions about what we thought about the story and about some of the other books they had there for us to look at.  That is all I can really remember.  Upon questioning my mom about this she told me it was for some educational video, she has no copy of it (I'd love to see it and if I can ever find it I'll try and upload clips of a little 8 or 9 year old me probably in sweat pants with my red Sally-Jesse Raphael glasses on) but thought it sounded like a "fun" thing to do.    I wonder what the  hell  made me think of that this morning.  I should probably stop hitting the crackpipe so hard before bed.

       Wow.   What an awesome weekend.  This weekend was Andrew's birthday weekend and even though it wasn't  my  birthday I still had an amazing time.  Friday was a lot of fun.  I got my hair done red again (with some blonde streaks...photos may be coming later) and afterwards met up with Bill, Jim, Todd and Andrew for a yummy lunch at  urlLink Sundown Saloon .  Back to the apartment for a quick nap and then it was time to start drinking.  My brother made a guest appearance and showed me some interesting things about forestry and then I was set.  My cousin, Melissa (aka Dana, aka Scheisty), showed up and we drank together as well.  Everyone who showed up to the house brought Andrew some beer (so needless to say they're all set with beer for a week or so).  We were even lucky enough to have a  urlLink Twan  sighting.  Saturday was relatively uneventful during the day.  Vicki, Andrew and I watched  urlLink The Game .  I've realized just how annoying it is to watch a movie on regular television.  I missed like huge chunks of the plot and I saw the same three commercials at every commercial break.  Rar.  It sucked.  Anyhow, Saturday evening we headed out to the Island for dinner with Andrew's family.  His brother cooked an AWESOME meal and I was so, so stuffed.  We headed back to Westchester thinking that a bunch of his hockey friends were coming over to drink only to find the apartment deserted.  I'm sure the neighbors were happy that it was acutally quiet there for one night, but whatever.  Rather than sit around and waste the night we decided to take in a movie and headed to the Greenwich movie theatre to see  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  It was a really amazing movie and it far surpassed my expectations.  Well, honestly I don't know that I  had  any expectations going into it, but it was just really incredible and I defintiley reccommend you guys check it out.  I'm definitley going to be going back to see it a second time.    Sunday was Ru's acutal birthday and we went into the city to celebrate and so he could spend his birthday money.  We headed to Toys R Us in Times Square to see what coolness was contained therein.  I ended up picking up a new My Little Pony for myself.  She's very pretty with pink, purple and blue hair.    which is among the newest theme restaurants in Times Square.  The food was acutally really, really good and VERY filling.  Finally it was time for the best part of the day...we went to the  urlLink American Museum of Natural History  to look at the dinosaurs, and it ROCKED.  We also checked out the gems and minerals (yes, I'm a huge nerd, whatever) and browsed the gift shop.  Good times indeed.  We headed home, watched Sopranos and vegged out the rest of the night.  All in all a pretty good weekend if I do say so myself.  Hope you all had as good a time as I did this weekend.

       Friday!   Well kids, its Friday.  Time again for me to post more useless nonsense here on my blog.    In cool news  urlLink Sabrina's Vagina  has answered my question.  I feel so cool!  The rockin' part is: her vagina was nice to me, w00t w00t!  In odd news (and yes, I stole this from  urlLink The Unlucky Guy ) the following seaches have brought people to my blog:  "don diva" "peel offs vertical happy birthday" "dapper don" "don and the diva" "dynamite diva" "partly cloudy patriot track listing" "quotes by guster & dispatch" "scottish flag tattoos" (I don't have one, but I need one final tatoo and that sounds f-ing badass!) "cute lil quotes" (spelled lil, like I usually spell it) "burton air snowboard"  I wonder what else will bring people here.  Gary seems to get some crazy, nutty dirty searches to his blog, I'm waiting for those to come here so I can laugh.   Again, I said it yesterday, but in case you didn't hear me the first time:   go listen to Pat McGuire ...go, NOW!  Well not right now, 'cause I'm still writing, but after you're done reading this.    Tonight is Andrew's birthday party at the house.  It shoudl be a good time.  We're all gonna get crazy snotted (that seems to be the theme for this week) hopefully I will not end up booting this time like I did last weekend.  His birthday present  still  hasn't arrived which is really annoying, but he'll have to deal, 'cause its so awesome and he'll love it and its funny 'cause he still has absolutely NO clue what it is.    I have really not been even remotely entertaining in weeks.  I suck.  Sorry, childrens.  For those of you from  urlLink  a strange place  you might remember my "Into the Diva's Toybox" thread.  A new one of those is in the works and will be hopefully as entertaining as it was last time.  And we're planning a safari into the filthy, smelly bedroom of an almost twenty-something boy (namely my stoney cheeba-monkey brother).  If you guys have anything you'd like investigated that a) wont put me in too much eminent danger, b) doesn't involve feces or c) wouldn't be too expensive to experiment let me know and I'll start a weekly post with the findings of my investigations.  (Think Geraldo exposes only twice as seedy and trashy).    I'm out, catch you all on the flipside!

       Happy Pretend-You're-Irish-To-Conceal-the-Fact-That-You're-Looking-For-An-Excuse-To-Binge-Drink-On-A-Weekday Day!   Thats right, I have no shame about it.  Today is a Wednesday and I'm going out and getting snotted tonight and I'll be hung over at work tomorrow as well, but you know what?!? I dont care!  I only have computer training for work tomorrow for a computer program that I don't even have access to and yet my job is paying $250 for me to sit there for half a day and listen to some guy talk.  (Glad to see your tax dollars hard at work, eh?)  I need a nap and I need  urlLink UConn  to come out with the summer schedule so I can start figuring out a) how the HELL I'm gonna pay for this and b) what the heck classes I'm going to be taking this summer.  I should probably get my lazy ass over there to speak to an acutal person instead of trying to figure it all out myself and be misinformed, but since when have I done anything the intelligent way?

       2 Months Later   Sunday would have been John's 20th birthday, but instead today is 2 Months to the day of John's death and the newspaper prints the finding of his toxicology report.  He died of cocaine and heroin toxicity.  He fucking overdosed on heroin and coke.  We all spent all these last few months trying to rack our brains on how he could have done this.  How he was supposed to be helping his other friend  kick  his heroin habbit and he himself was doing it.  Tonight is not going to be easy at home.

       Thank You, Dunkin' Donuts     urlLink      Your new cups with the sippy lids really rock my socks off.  It makes transporting my tasty medium french vanilla, light and sweet with milk (not cream) a treat.  I also like drinking from it.  I wish more cups would hop on the sippy lid bandwagon.  Your cups are superior to Starbucks', because not only are you killing the environment with the styrofoam, but I can still close it with the neato cup fastener unlike your competitor who shoots hot magma coffee out around turns and bumps.  Thank you for making my day and thank you again for firing the idiot redhead woman who always messed up my order.  That was swell of you.

       You've GOT To Be Kidding Me   (Alternate Title: The Insensitive Bitch Lives to Rant Again)   Okay,so many of you readers who've been around for any length of time I'm sure are familiar with  urlLink wheelchair guy  and the stories of his fetid stench, disgusting fingernail clippings and gross food habits.  Today a new annoyance is born.  He has taken to bringing in a cassette tape and listening to it loudly at his desk.  Ordinarily this would annoy me a) because its rude to have your personal music loud to the point where its interfering with people's work and phone calls, but it gets worse.  Oh yes, worse my friends.  You see this tape is some evil creation he mixed himself consisting of all Spanish music ranging from salsa, to a Spanish Kenny-G to the worst thing that you could possibly hear all day long on loop:  The Spanish Version of the Macarena.   Yes, the macarena.  Apparently no one got the memo that its not 1997 anymore and the macarena is still not cool.  For the better part of the last two hours I've been hearing this crap and to make things worse: he's taken to singing along with it.  Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bitch and everyone in my office is complaining about it, but  urlLink I don't like confrontations,  so I suffer in silence as the tape gets flipped and the Latino goodness starts anew.  92 days and counting 'til I'm out of here.  Start hedging your bets as to whether or not I'll make it.  I've got my money on me snapping or trying to get fired before my time comes.    Happy Monday, childrens.

       No, no, no...not Again   Since Monday I haven't slept more than an hour at a time with out being restless and worried for hours in between.  I don't know what's wrong.  To me, nothing *seems* wrong.  I'm very happy righ tnow, I love my friends, I love the situations I'm in right now (with the exception of my job, but even that is manageable).  For the last few days I've had this weird sense of impending panic.  I tried to be extra silly this week and kind of laugh it off, in hopes that I'd forget that I'm feeling nutty again.  Last nite I laid in bed, sweating and awake, I'd doze off feeling that maybe 3 or four hours had passed...It was only half an hour.  I've laid in my bed for days this week after I was done running with Billy just thinking and thinking not even about anything.  Not even about anything coherent or sensical.  Just wheels spinning constantly.  I feel like I'm losing my mind again and I'm scared.  This morning in the shower I had a panic attack.  I started to shake and become short of breath.  I thought I was freezing so I turned the water up as hot as it could go and as it came down, burning, I stood beneath it and shivered and tried to breathe.    I don't want to go back on my Paxil.  I don't need it.  I feel shitty all day today, my thoughts are scattered.  I'm physically here, mentally who knows.  I thought I was okay.

       The Soundtrack of Life   (Yes, some of you have already seen this)   How many days and moments have you passed on your journey through life?  How many things did you swear that while they were happening you'd never forget them?  How many of those things do you actually remember now?  The synaptic pathways in your brain may not always allow you to recall offhand just what happened or why it was so damn significant, but there is one ever evolving, ever present, common thread in all of our lives that can bring any of us to those places that our neurons have seemed to forgotten the way to.    Each of us has a soundtrack to our lives, whether we're conscious of it or not, there are songs and artists and entire albums that shape each of these experiences.  Experiences that some of us may have chalked up as lost, things we might have wanted to hold on to, to keep close to our hearts because as those brief minutes of that song passed us by we were living moments of pure unadulterated emotion.  So pure, so joyous or so painful, so real and tangible to us in those moments that no matter how much it crippled our hearts and our being we just didn't want to let it go.  Raw emotion like that is so over-hyped today and yet, so fleeting.    Sometimes we hear just a few chords to a song from our soundtrack and the timbre rises loudly in our ears.  All our other senses cease and we're back in those moments.  Feeling the weather, feeling the pangs of emotion, smelling the air from that exact second that we've captured forever and we dive in and find ourselves awash in a sea of memories we thought were forgotten, our hearts reeling as we try to decide how were going to hold onto them this time.    If someone asked me to give a track listing to the soundtrack of my life I'm not sure what I'd list on it.  I'd like to think that my songs and my life would be an entire playlist on an ipod capable of being shuffled and repeated, more vast than a brief twenty songs stuck forever in a predetermined order by a C.E.O. at a record label.  Songs that while they're reminiscent of a scene in my own life aren't tainted by the cliches of a studio movie plot.  Everyday as I add another song to my collection I have this inherent need to replay and revisit those old songs.  Just to linger a few moments in what once was and how I got where I am now from there.    I won't tell you why I've chosen what I've chosen and who knows some of these songs might be on your soundtrack as well, but these are some of mine and each of them is so much more to me than notes and lyrics, they're moments gone but not forgotten. The Refreshments "Banditos" Any Beastie Boys track Debbie Gibson "Electric Youth" Etta James "At Last" Third Eye Blind "Motorcycle Drive-by" Jackson 5 "I Want You Back" Phish "Guelah Papyrus" Any Dave Matthews Band track from "Recently", "Remember 2 Things", "Under the Table and Dreaming", "Crash" or "Before These Crowded Streets" The Offspring "Self Esteem" Lucas "Lucas With The Lid Off" WuTang "Triumph" Green Day "Good Riddance" Any Maroon 5 track Eminem "The Way I Am" Indigo Girls "The Wood Song" Mariah Carey "Heartbreaker" and "Breakdown" The Roots "You Got Me" Grateful Dead "Cats Under The Stars" 311 "Love Song" (Yes, I know its a Cure cover) The Get-Up Kids "Mass Pike" The Used "The Taste of Ink" Blues Traveler "Hook" Triumph The Insult Comic Dog "Lick Myself" Fuel "Shimmer" Vertical Horizon "Everything You Want" R.E.M. "Nightswimming" Stevie Wonder "Signed, sealed, delivered"  There are a million more, but I only wanted to offer you all a smattering of what'd be on mine and maybe if you'd like to leave some of yours in the comments, I have some free iTunes songs and I'm looking for suggestions on what to choose.

       Fresh From The Betty Ford Clinic        Wow.  So I slept from 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon until 6:47 a.m. this morning.  I feel fanfuckingtastic!  My liver was tappin' out because from last Thursday until yesterday I had drank to black out / tears /mega-bad hangover 3 times.  Thats B A D.  I spent all of last Friday at work running to the toilet to puke at least once every twenty minutes.  I woke up for work still drunk.  Wednesday night of this week I lost my f'n mind and I realized I have no control.  I got 4 hours of sleep after a raging-lunatic-scream-fest on my part.  (Sorry to all those who had to look after me and deal with my insanity).  I dunno.  I think I need to chill out for a lil while on drinking...either that or maybe I should stop drinking 2 half and half pint glasses of gatorade and absolut in an hour...after three drinks at the bar before that.  Cinco de Mayo is coming so there is prolly a tequilla-fueled bootfest in my near future.  I dunno, I feel mad guilty about all of this and I don't think I even did anythign *that* wrong.  Hmmm...  On a happier note:  I gave work defintive notice that I'm leaving July 30th to be back at school full time.  Thats a Friday so you all better be ready to get into the city to get your kareoke/dance/party on to celebrate my freedom.  The aggrivation of this job: gone.  The decent pay check: gone (which sucks) but I'll be able to make it.  Its an interesting day, kids.

       Smileworthy   So here it is, April 28th, why did I make a big deal about this approaching?  Simple:   The 3 Month Curse  is finally broken!  What is the 3 month curse:  well you see of my last 3 boyfriends (or attempts at re-dating old boyfriends) I've had this problem where before we can make it to the 3 month mark in our relationships I just lose interest or discover my feelings were different than I'd thought or in some extreme cases I find that they make my skin crawl and stomach turn and they're just generally deadbeat dirtbags (see March to May-ish of last year's archives).  I've finally found a guy though, who is:  a) my own age  b) local (as in only 5 mins away) c) employed d) cute  e) not on drugs (illegal or prescription)      f) not from the internet g) knows me as Deja and not Gwen          h) did I mention cute?  this isn't meant as a slam to the exes...only one of you was a dirtbag/druggie/loser at life   So, Andrew, thank you for a very fun 3 months and I hope we can continue to enjoy many more 'cause you're stuck with me now :p

       Victim Of A Foolish Heart    "Your scars were still showing when I first met you, baby, from all she had done to you.  And I came along and applied a little loving.  Slowly, but surely I brought you through.  Now she's back to rekindle that old flame.  She's got a different angle, baby, but she's playing the same old game.  Baby, don't be the victim of a foolish heart.  Don't let her lies get next to you.  She's trying to tear us apart and she's trying to make me a victim too.  Now I know she comes around here every time I leave, 'cause she knows she's still on your mind.  See, even a wiseman jumps in misery somewhere down the line, but only a fool will jump the second time.   Our affair is growing stronger every day, don't let her steal our happiness away.  Don't be the victim of a foolish heart.  Don't let her lies get next to you.  Can't you see what she's doing to you, boy?  Don't be a victim." ~ j. stone    Joss Stone is really rockin' my world these days.  Her and iTunes are where it seems to be at.

       Entering the Home Stretch   In approximately 15 and a half hours it will be April 28th.  Who cares, well, I care.  I'll let you know after it happens, but lets just hope I make it.  In exactly 15.5 hours it will be 2 months until my birthday.  Get ready to get your party on, childrens.  I'm thinking a bar crawl spectacular...details to come later.    Everything was pretty fun this weekend.  I enjoyed a yummy dinner with my fellow angels Farrah & Lucy and afterwards we all hung at Finn's for a bit.  Saturday the weather was absolutely AMAZING.  The boy and I headed out to Long Island and saw his new puppy, Harley, who is the CUH YOO TEST thing I have ever seen.  Dinner at Black Bear wasn't as good as it usually was because we had the biggest crackpot of a waiter.  I watched Kill Bill again (to think I'd almost forgotten just how HARD it rocked my ass the first time!) and I'm highly anticipating getting out to see part 2 this week or weekend.  The sun is shining again today, there are just a few more hours to go and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I'm gonna leave you guys with a good song (no, there is no hidden meaning behind it...it was just the last thing I heard on my way outta the house this morning and this blog needs more Goldfinger!)  "I run away  'Cause I'm scared that you might leave There's nothing wrong, But that's not what I believe. Just tell me it's alright And tell me I'm okay And tell me that you're  Staying here tonight.  I feel stupid saying Words you've heard before. The way I feel today Is all I know for sure And if I scare you I'm only scaring me. I've got so much to say Why won't you speak with me? I need to know  What you're feeling Do you feel like I do? Let's talk about everything, I want to share my life with you And tell me that you feel The way I feel tonight And tell me that you know This feels right  If you're in my life Well I want to be sure I'm not wasting time I've been through this before"

       Life Lesson # 2,348   When you have a 9 a.m. meeting its probablly best NOT to mix chinese food, one blue mermaid glass drink, 2 Malibu Baybreezes, 1/2 a pitcher of Labatt's Blue and a Molson XXX.  While 6 drinks is not that much, the chinese food was the crazy x-factor that lead to me driving home at 2 a.m. confused and sad (though I'm not sure there was anything to be confused or sad about), getting upset over a miscommunication amongst friends and then waking up at 6 a.m. and puking everywhere.  Its almost 7 a.m. now, I still feel drunk, I can't call out, I don't want to eat anything.  All I can do is pray that I can get the consultant out of the building by noon and use comp time I earned by going to last night's meeting to come home and try and recover.  Ugh.  Please put a bullet in my head....thats only in tha mawnin'

       All Smiles For Today   Great weekend.  Amazing weather, could have done with a few less fights, but I got to meet  urlLink Coral  from the Real World New York and  urlLink David  from the Real World Seattle (Holy Hotness, Batman!) as part of this  urlLink Reality Bar Crawl  thing that was going on.  It was a fun night, Bex and I rocked out, saw an imposter who was a dead ringer from the side, saw 2 bar fights and got our drank on.  Good times.    The boy came back from Canada and it was *so* good too see him.  His birthday present also came in while he was away so, though its almost a month late, he finally got it.  Got to talk lots with Bill, got to clear the air with a few people, got a lot of work done around the house, just generally starting to feel good again.  Billy also explained to me the funniest thing I've probably heard in a long time.  He explained the wonder that is the  urlLink Angry Pirate .  Good times, childrens, good times.

       Le Sigh   My boyfriend has really delicious lips.  They're those rare boy lips that are actually quite full and voluptuous as opposed to your standard, run-of-the-mill, thin, lizard boy lips.  They're lips that look really amazing and inviting when they're pouty, though he very rarely ever pouts.  They're the kind of lips that are fun to trace the outline of with your tounge and give a quick nibble to as we break our kiss.  Wether its an innocent brush of them against my forehead or somewhere a bit more naughty, they make me shiver.  They're these really cute lips that when he speaks sometimes give him what sounds like a lisp, but isn't and can make even a mumble of nonsense sound sexy.  I feel like sometimes our lips are magnetic becuase they always seem to be locked together.  I can lie in bed with him for hours just kissing with him becuase his lips are that good.  Sometimes we'll press our foreheads to one another and share a quick smooch and then he'll cock his head back and open his mouth revealing his equally as nice teeth and he'll just laugh and squeeze me to him.  In those moments, things are so perfect, that I feel like I could die.

       Friday!   Happy Friday, boys & girls!  I hope that the lovely weather of the last day has cheered us all up a little bit, I know its helped for me.  I've been pretty busy the last few days trying to tie up some loose ends with UConn stuff, considering a change of departments at work, some craziness on the friend front (as I'm sure you all saw from my last stoopit posts), seeing the boy off to Canada for the weekend for his hockey tournament and just generally trying to preserve my mental health.    I've lost 5 pounds, so I'm feeling happy about that, the sun is back to shining, I've spent some well needed time with my kitties these last few days and I'm painting my boring white walled room this weekend.  Its gonna be periwinkle-ish with a bright purple focus wall.  I've also commissioned the boy to repaint my snowboard deck (I finally settled on a design...photos will come when its done) and make some art for my focus wall at home.  Unfortunately he's CRAZY allergic to kitties and seeing as I have six he can't come over and acutally paint a mural on my wall like I had wanted, but we're gonna take 4 big canvases and have him paint on those and then hang them, it will rock your socks of when you see the pics!  I want to say Happy Birthday to the lovely Missy (even though it was yesterday).  I hope it was a good day and you got lots of strappy heels and cute dresses to get you through this next year (c:  Thats gonna do it for me today, but if you can get out and enjoy the sunshine your brain will thank you.

       Right, Thanks   When I go to bat for you to try and help you and you know I'm going to do it and you don't tell me the truth and make me look like a fucking liar to people who  are  telling the truth thats really shitty and messed up.  So, yeah, thanks for being my friend.  Next time I hope you'll wash the blood off from last time before stabbing the knife into my back again.  I don't want your drama.

       Vocabulary Lesson   Children please open your notebooks to a fresh sheet of paper and copy down the following new vocabulary words no one seems to know yet, noting key differences between the 2 words:   fiend    (P)Pronunciation Key(fnd)   n.  1. An evil spirit; a demon. 2. The Devil; Satan. 3.  A diabolically evil or wicked person.  4. Informal. One who is  addicted to something : a dope fiend.   friend    (P)Pronunciation Key(frnd)   n.   A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  A person whom one knows; an acquaintance. A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.  One of the key differences is the letter "r".  "R" can be found in such other words like retarded, really (as in really stupid) and ridiculous.  We'll delve into words like that another day though, students.    It seems to me nothign is any different today than any other day of the last 3 months except that everyone now knows I can't keep a secret and thinks that  I  am lying, ha!  My last bit of advice to you all is this:  if you get shown the light but are too blinded by it to move out of it, don't cry to me when you get burned by it.  Also get a fucking STD test if you're not using condoms you're just asking for a super stinging new strain of the clap.

       Yeah, UConn!       Okay so the  urlLink UConn  men are the NCAA Champs, now we just have to see if the Ladies can beat Tennessee tonight (a much tougher opponent than Georgia Tech), to make the goold old UC the first team in NCAA history to have the men and women as champions in the same year.    If they're already  urlLink rioting now , imagine what would happen if the ladies  do  win...

       Most Offensive Song Inspiration    **Warning: I'm sure this is really offensive to a lot of people, but I in no way condone this and I can't believe it actually exists, and I'm not a racist and I hope there is some explanation for it from the homeowner, but I'm too skeered to ask.**   Okay, so my friend Billy and I walk around these nice, quiet little neighborhoods to get exercise and try and get in shape.  Friday on our walk we stumble upon this house with a swingset in the front yard and sitting on the swingset is what appears to be (and judge for yourself) a  urlLink stuffed KKK baby .  I did not make this up, photoshop it or anything, it just sits out there, I photographed it today because no one would beleive either of us if we just said we saw it.  Billy said maybe it was supposed to be a ghost baby for Halloween or something, but its just one of those things that sometimes you just need to see to believe.

It doesn't really seem like much, but when play is stopped in your game and you signal to my friend to tell me about an inside joke that we have with each other it, literally makes me smile *so, so* much.  Thank you for dealing with my insanity and then getting up to hit the snooze for me twice and suffering through the alarm 4 times in a morning instead of just one.

       Goodbye, Mess!        Last night I went to Madison Square Garden to watch Mark Messier's last home game of his career.  Although the Rangers lost (surprise, surprise) it was still a really awesome game.  The last five minutes the crowd started to get really nuts and the whole place pretty much was on their feet.  There was the "Mess-i-er" cheers and lots and lots of screaming.  Finally, after the game Mess came out and bowed and thanked the crowd, shed a few tears.  It was really an amazing night.  Hard to recap the energy and emotion of the situation.    After that we (me, Andrew, Jimmy, Margaret, Todd, Vicki & her friend and the Senator) headed to Play by Play for some drinks.  Todd made some sort of hot sauce, bud light, mustard nugget concoction and acutally drank it (ew!) and then we had a round of TRIPLE SoCo and Lime shots.  On the train ride home Andrew made a passing comment that something was "glorious" and the guys behind us start trading Old School lines with him.  It was pretty funny to say the least.  A great night all around.  So here I am, home for the day becuase I have a "sinus headache", but I think I'm finally gonna get my ass to UConn and try and sort some things out.

I never thought a mac could break, until you drop a rock on it...The "j" key flew off and there is a dent by the track pad, the screen went black and I can't tell if its on or off.  Thats gonna have to get fixed.  Hopefully the lil elves at  urlLink Apple  can do that for me.    Long weekend coming, yay!  Plan on BBQs, time with my girls, movies, hockey and cooking.  Anyone have any simple, but to-die-for cookout recipes?  Lay 'em on me.

       Things That Make Me Go Grrrrrr   1.  Starting on a hill at a light with a manual transmission and someone pulls up thisclose behind you causing you to a) stall out or b) squeal your tires like its Dukes of Hazaard*  2.  Liars  3.  People who think they're better than they acutally are  4.  Rainy days (when its been raining for like 5 days in a row.  This is Connecticut, not Seattle)  5.  People who can't take a hint  6.  People who don't clean up after themselves  7.  Not having a sufficient amount of money  8.  Working at this job  9.  My 2 favorite pens dying on the same day  10.  The exorbited price of gyms  11.  Having to clean my room...again (I don't even really live there anymore)  12.  Living between 2 places and never having what you're looking for at that moment at the place you are right then  13.  Vacations ending  14.  Friends moving away  15.  Realizing how much time you've wasted being "responsible"  *   In fairness to me, I've only been driving my new car for like less than 6 hours total so its exepcted that I'm not gonna be *perfect* at driving it.  It just makes me aggrivated though.

       Professional Fly Swatter   This weekend I crushed a really big bug.  One of those pests thats always buzzing in your ear, not really doing anything wrong, just being annoying like a fruit fly.  Good news is I didn't even have to wash my hands or shoes off afterwards.  It was a good clean kill.

       O, Canada!   Well children, I'm back from my trip to Toronto.  If I could sum it up in one word: awesome.  Toronto has all the things about Canada that I love: my dollar going further, stronger drinks, clean streets,  urlLink Roots , hockey and none of the stuff I hated about Montreal (the rude attitude & all the Frenchness).  I would go back (and maybe even move there) in a heartbeat, but first I'd like to go back to the Caribbean.  Anyhow, Friday we travelled there, checked in and checked out the area around our hotel.  We were staying downtown about 2 blocks from the  urlLink Eaton Centre  so we snooped around in there and came back to the hotel and swam.  We headed out to dinner and stumbled upon one of the best restaurants I've probably ever eaten:  urlLink Brown Stone Bistro  on Yonge street.  I had a delicious (albeit burningly strong) mango-appley martini, bacon-wrapped filet mignon in a red wine demiglace (perfectly cooked and seasoned the most deliciousway I've ever eaten a steak!).  Yummy deserts as well.  A perfect beginning to our evening.  We eventually came across "Hoops" a sports bar/hooters-esque kind of place where the boy and I put back quite a few drinks.  I ended up with the hiccups (Imagine bugs bunny after a few swigs from the XXX jug, lol) and discovered the perfect failproof cure for them.  A great night for our first night in town.  Saturday we went to the  urlLink Hockey Hall of Fame  which I have to say was *really* awesome.  I was pleasantly suprrised.  It was very cool to see the Stanley cup (and the real one and the vault in which its contained), the old jerseys were also really cool too.  They had a small collection of goalie masks (I was hoping there'd be more to look at) the old fashioned ones were just scary looking and Andrew played goalie and forward in the simulation games.  Next we headed over to the  urlLink CN Tower  which is the world's tallest building which was kind of cool.  We rode this lego simulator ride which was a lil cheezy but fun none the less.  There was CRAZY security there which I felt fine about and I even managed to go out on the glass floor,  scared as I may have been I got out there for a picture of it just so I *never* have to do it again, haha.  We had lunch at the skydome which was cool and then headed back to the hotel.  We napped, watched some of the Tampa Bay & Philly game and then headed out to an atrocious dinner.  A dinner so bad and so overpriced that I won't even say where we ate.  Drinks at the  urlLink Wolf & Firkin Pub  wound out the night.    Sunday we went back to Brownstone for brunch, walked around, shopped and saw Troy (the Paramount theatre in Toronto's entertainment district is the BEST movie theatre ever!.  I know you're thinking "what the hell did you go to the movies for if you were on vacation?" (well, maybe you're not wondering but I'll justify it to you anyhow) we had done all we wanted to do that we *could* do weather permitting and we needed to kill some time.  Dinner at  urlLink Wayne Gretzky's  was delicous and started us on our Sunday evening pub crawl which ended up being some trival pursuit questions at another firkin pub and then triple shots at this weird little hole in the wall.    All in all an absolutely awesome trip, lots of fun, good company, shopping and dining.  Toronto is where its at, kids.

       YAY YAY YAY!       Come Thursday I will be the proud owner of a very pretty black 2001 Volkswagen Jetta (yes, before the Pathfinder I had a different Jetta and neither are the one pictured above).  Its so pretty; it has grey leather interior, a sun roof, tinted windows, nice alloy rims, heated seats and lots of other goodies.  Also: its manual so place bets now on how long it takes me to completely anihilate the clutch.  I think I'm going to name him Trevor (my last Jetta was named Travis).    So uh...anyone wanna buy a Pathfinder??

Please, for the love of all things good and holy I'm going to give you a choice:   1) Unplug from your computer immediately, go outside, let the funky stink blow off you and learn to meet new people.  Start slowly, go the grocery store or McDonalds or something just get interaction with somoene besides your cyber-life mate.  2) Put the plastic bag from your latest internet shimpent to your house over your head and tape it around your neck.  Start breathing deeply so you use up all the oxygen and eventually suffocate and off yourself.  Please, for me?  I'll give you a dollar.

       All Smiles To Start The Week   I had a really,  really  great weekend again.  Even my good friend, One Brown Eyed Hank, can attest to it this time.  Friday I went over to the boy's house, but he was already half in the bag and incapable of functioning normally. (Oddly drinking tequila with your boss since 4p.m. will do that to you come 8 o'clock.)  Hank, his brother (Hank Jr.), his brother's girlfriend (the delightful Marianne), Vicki, the boy and I watched Boondock Saints.  I'd never seen this movie and everyone who had seen it raves about it.  Now I know why.  Well there are acutally 2 reasons why:  urlLink 1  &  urlLink 2 .  Just kidding, it rocked my socks off, the shootouts, the concept of it all, really well done.  I finally understand a lot of people's random quotings that I never got and I'm excited about the prospect of  urlLink All Saints Day  as well.    Saturday I went to look at my new *dream car* I will withhold any information on it to avoid jinxing anything, but it was truly an amazing thing.  I'm very excited for it (hopefully).  Saturday afternoon Andrew and I went to lunch in Greenwich and saw the delightful Al Roker out with his family.  Good times indeed.  Met back up with Hank, Hank Jr., Vicki, Marianne and Becki and we headed out for a 3 hour tour of the Bronx...um, er, I mean a trip to Arthur Avenue (just kidding, Jim!).  We picked up some cheese, saw cheese elephants, bought pasta, prosciutto and bread.  The lovely Jimmy & Vicki made us a homemade Italian feast with Vicki's awesome ass kicking sauce.  Yum.  We all got our drink on some hilarious photos were taken, Reg and I headed to bed early and that was that.  Sunday yummy panckakes, trip to the mall, purchasing of some old skool nintendo-y goodness and a little starbucks & zelda thrown in for good measure.  All in all a great weekend as always, with great friends and some funny assed photos to go with it.

       Stop The Presses!   I actually have something nice to say about being friends with girls!  There is nothing more relaxing and low stress than a night lounging with your girls.  You can go in your t's and p.j. pants, you don't have to put on make-up, you can just pull a ball cap over your hair and there is no pressure.  You can just lounge and laugh and there is little to no pretense.  I almost forgot that was possible.    Don't get me wrong: I  love  to get dolled up and go out with my girls for a night out on the town, but there is a different air when that happens.  There is a lot of checking yourself, constantly comparing always in competition although its never spoken; it's just always there.  Last night was a chill night.

       This Blog Is a Beacon...    urlLink for people who like otters, bitches, a good cum recipe and those of our fine feathered friends who can't spell .  You reap what you sew...go figure.  I'm going to get serious for one brief moment, and one moment only:  when I was younger I read books like  urlLink Song of Roland  and through studying other parts of Medieval and Middle history you realize how bloody the crusades are, but somehow they still seemed to have been a little romanticized.  Now, finding ourselves essentially in the midst of a new crusade its not as brave, noble or even as important as it may have seemed back then.  We may have buried the flag of Christianity under the guise of "anti-terrorism", but we're on the fast track to the same scenario.  This is not my stance either for or against the war (though I  do  support our troops and believe that if we couldn't help we woudln't be there) it was merely an observation.

       Countdowns    10 days  until I leave for vacation in Toronto.  I'm very stoked for this trip.  I've never been to Toronto and our hotel has a waterslide indoors!  Woo!  Plus it'll be just Andrew and I which should be fun.  I'm looking forward to strong booze, duty free airport shopping, Tim Horton's donuts and my dollars being able to go farther!  w00t!  I am however,  not  looking forward to having to fly.  I hate flying.  Aside from just being scared, my sinuses have really been bothering me (I know you *all* needed to know that) and the cabin pressure is prolly gonna make me want to die.     48 days  until my birthday *yayayayyay*  I'll be the big 2-3.  Oooh, how utterly uneventful.  However I'm looking forward to spending the day at the spa being pampered and dinner with friends and family and a bar crawl earlier that weekend to commemorate the greatness that is me.   52.5 days  until I leave this awful job for good!  No more bullshit customers, no more shitty sewer project (no pun intended), no more Outcome based budgeting.  Its a dream come true.   I'm starting to already have the nightmares of getting phone calls from customers.  However, in preparation of my departure I've cut my workload in half and doubled my productivity.  The person I'm training to do my job wants to do everything so they can get accustomed to it, so all my work gets done and I have time to do productive things, like blog or look up outings to go on in Toronto, so its been really helpful in that respect.    I have decided to share the love of the baking bug thats bit me recently so I offer up this deal to you people: if you would like cookies (chocolate chip, sugar or peanut butter) email me your address and I will mail you a dozen cookies free of charge, no strings attached just pick your flavor.  All you have to do is be patient because I only bake on weekends so they won't ship until Monday.  I know I've promised people things in the past, but I was lazy, but now I am constantly baking and constantly at the post office so you're guranteed to get 'em.  I promise they're yummy and all I'd ask is for a little blog love after you get them.  I'm a shameless promowhore like that sometimes.  **Oh, if I don't get your address in time to bake your cookies this weekend you're going to have to wait until after Memorial day (as I previously stated I'll be in Toronto the weekend after next).**

       Weekend Recap   Friday night dinner with my girls (Bex, Stay, Megs & Billy...though he's not a girl, but you get the point).  Cruisin' around drinkin' boones in Stay's car like we were 16 again.  Funny times, girls, funny times.  Headed to the boy's apartment for some forestry and just laughs.  Saturday I chilled around my house, baked some chocolate chip cookies and napped.  I saw possibly, the most disturbing porn I've ever seen (Bella Loves Jenna w. Jenna Jameson & Belladonna).  I never thought I'd say I was bothered by porn, but this time I really was.  And good GOD, Jenna is probably the most amazingly hot person I have ever seen in my life ever.  At night Andrew and I went to dinner at  urlLink F.I.S.H.  and yes, though its at the dump, they have amazing ambience, amazing food & deserts and an AMAZING martini selection.  My new personal fave is the Flirtini (Stoli Razz, Stoli O, Cranberry Juice, O.J. and champagne.  Yum!) and then we picked up Todd to go see VanHelsing.  Worst.Movie.Ever.  I almost walked out.  I was so *amped* for this movie and it sucked such balls its not even worth giving it a review.  Fuck!  Sunday Rosie died, which was sad, but once we made arrangements for her everything got a little better.  I baked peanut butter cookies and sugar cookies (my own recipe for the sugar cookies...and they were good!)  I spent some quality time with my mommy and then my brother and I took her out for a delightful dinner at  urlLink Ruth's Chris  so that was pretty slammin'.  I slept at my *own* house for the first time in weeks.  I have to say: I miss my bed its so comfy and squishy and soft, damn it.    All this baking I've been doing lately has prompted me to want to hone my craft.  Who knows maybe I'll open a quaint little bakery portion of things to go with me & Lisa's "top secret business plan" that we let go by the wayside.  That could be cool.

       Meh...   Today my cat, Rosie, died.  This is sad and a bummer in and of itsself, but last Saturday my dog, Buddy, (the one we adopted back in August) had to get put to sleep because he had lymphosarcoma.  Not a really great last week by any standards.  We had 2 dogs and 6 cats and they're all around the same age and yes, thankfully all of them are very old, meaning we've spent the large part of my youth/teenage years/ young adulthood with them, but now they're all kind of dying off at once and its indeed very sad.  )c:

       ...   You are strong and beautiful and funny and amazing and you are so much better than this.  You will rise from this like a phoenix, twice as strong and twice as beautiful and expotentially more amazing and wise.  You are someone who breathes life into every place they go and you are cheerful and selfless and someone who would do anything for anyone if you were capable of doing it.  This isn't you and though you've had to retract for fear of words like barbs and daggers tearing at your heart, I know somewhere, you're in there still deep down.  Just your smile can light the way back for you.  Please don't forget to smile.  I love you.  xoxo

       My Sides Hurt From Laughing        Me & Bex Out On The Town.     Wow, what a great weekend.  Friday night I went out for dinner with Bill, Megan & Todd.  We had a great time, some yummy food and just laughed like it was our job.  Megan, Billy and I went to Todd & Andrew's game and they won so yay, but we also had a lot of fun mocking people and all the lil "tween queens" who were there at the rink on dates getting dumped.  We headed home for what ended up being a relatively early night.  Saturday was absofreakin'loutely gorgeous!  Andrew and I had a yummy lunch at  urlLink Roly Poly , and I got bit by the baking bug.  So while the boy and Todd stayed indoors playing video games all day I baked peanut butter chip brownies for the boy, and homemade chocolate chip cookies for the house.  (I'm not too bad at the whole domestic thing if I *do* say so myself!)  After their game was over we headed to the theatre to see Kill Bill 2.  Wow.  Just awesomeness there.  If you haven't seen it: go see it!  If you've seen it: go see it again, damn it!  We visited crazy Japanese cult leader, Adam, and then participated in some interesting forestry activities.  Todd and Andrew are probably the 2 of the funniest people ever and the night was just nothing but absolutely side-splitting laughs to the point where my abs are sore today from it.  Hahah.  (Dominoes will deliver...Even to here??...Insert birdhead gestures here)  We watched Andrew's secret girlfriend, Linsday Loughin, host SNL and while the over all show wasn't extremely funny, the skit w. Amy Pohler and Lindsay's sleep over (Rick.rick.rick.rick) was fucking hysterical, I haven't laughed that hard at SNL in a long time and I was just in tears.  Cheesy bread from Dominoes saved the night and we headed off to bed.  Sunday was bacon, egg & cheese day, and veg around the house.  Watched Sum of All Fears and the Flyers disgusting annihilation of the Maple Leafs (yes, I realize "leaves" is the proper plural of leaf, but in the NHL its the "leafs").  I went home and worked on my mom's Mother's Day present (don't forget children, May 9th...this sunday!!)  I think that about does it, but I want to thank  urlLink Andrew , Todd, Megan and Billy for another great weekend.  Catch ya on the flip side kids!

       My Diva-senses Were Tingling   Okay so I saw the midnite showing of Spiderman 2.  It was really, really great. I find this hard to say because I really enjoyed the first one, but this one totally suprassed it and my expectations for it.  I thought it was going to be overhyped like the rest of the summer movies, but Sam Raymi didn't disappoint, plus,  having hot assed Tobey Maguire in a sometimes shredded Spidey suit didn't hurt either.  Do yourself the favor and get your ass out to see it.  Even if you have to sit in a theatre full of ignorant chuckleheads yelling "Awwwwwww sheeeeit son, that kid got knocked out.  That was C r A z Y".

       The Pre Birthday Review        Wow.  Simply put, just wow is all I can say.  Friday night was probably the best birthday party I've had ever.  It was nothing over the top, nothing crazy, just an absolutely amazing night spent with amazing, wonderful people.  My boyfriend and his roomates were super awesome and lent me their house to host my party.  My local group of people showed up for the festivities shortly after 8, we ate some dinner and then we started drinking.  As the night wore on more friends from high school who I hadn't seen in about a year showed up and that was also cool.  My brother, his girl, their friend and my cousin also showed up along with 2 other friends from New York.   Once everyone was here and had played enough Kings, Asshole or "forestry" to get good and "happy" my boyfriend (who is quite possibly the best most incredible guy in the world (and now its been proven)) gave me the first of many awesome surprises.  He got everyone together and they sang happy birthday to me and he had Ice cream cake (my favoritest!) and all these candles.  I'll have a birthday photo album up so y'all can check it out, but I want to wait for tonight to be over first.  It was so great, I felt like when you're a lil kid in school and you get to bring in cupcakes and all the kids in your class sing to you.  Since I'm a summer baby I never got to do that, so this was awesome and so so fun (c:  It almost made me cry thats how great it was.  Also, this year, none of the cake or whipped cream ended up in my face in front of a bar full of people, so that was swell.  After the first party crowd dispersed around midnight my brother, Katy, my cousin and Andrew chilled for a while until about 1:30 when the second party started.  Todd, his roomate, and Bex and Vicki came home with 2 guys from their hockey team.  The very accurately named "Animated Kevin" and Fabs.  More hilarity ensued.  I had been partying since 8 though, so I called it a night around 3, my brother left around 2:30 and the rest of the party went til about 7 or 8 in the a.m.  Nice!  Saturday morning Andrew gave me my birthday present.  I'm now one step closer to full on mac geek-dom and the proud owner of a bright, shiny new, totally excellent: iPod!  Yayayayayayay!  He's not just awesome for buying such a kick ass present, but it didn't hurt his cause.  I snoozed around the house and then Bex and I headed out to PNC Bank Arts Center to see The GetUp Kids *my faves but we got there too late and missed 'em*, Thrice and Dashboard Confessional.  I have to say I'm not the hugest Dashboard fan, but seeing them and getting to hear more than just "Screaming Infidelities" made me defintiley start to dig 'em.  We had a random run-in with Twan on the way home, Bex was accosted by some drunk wierdo who wanted Burger King and we sang Diana Ross and much other cheezy music in the car on the ride home.    Sunday I got all girlified with my mommy and we went and got manicures and pedicures then to the mall to pick out some presents and eat some chinese food.  Not too shabby.  I'm not sure when I'll acutally be getting the pressies from my mom, but not to worry.   I ended up at Chez Megan (home of tonight's totally awesome pool party) to look at pictures with Bex, Josh and Andrew and then we went out to Boston Market for some yummy eats.  Came home, Bex, Todd Andrew and I found a new addiction:  the Surreal Life.  Holy what a crock of crap, but its a train wreck so you have to watch.  Here we are, Monday moring.  My acutal birthday.  Andrew woke me up with Dunkin Donuts Iced French Vanilla Coffee and a Strawberry frosted donut my favoritest breakfast (see what I mean about how thoughtful and amazingly awesome he is) and Bex and I are going to head to the beach later, then out to delicious birthday dinner at FISH and then the lovely Megs is hosting my "proper" birthday bash.  This is seriously the best weekend of my entire life.  I want to thank everyone who participated for just being so awesome and so fun and such good friends.  You're all amazing people and I love you all and I'm looking forward to this next year with you.     urlLink Look, I even still get RonFez.Net Birthday Threads!!!

       I've Got Nothing   Yup, so I'm alive.  My allergies are making me insane-o, but other than that I gots nothing.  Kick ass weekend is about to happen: Party for my birthday tomorrow night (my birthday is acutally Monday, but a lil pre-emptive partying never hurt anyone, right?)  If you're interested in the details of it or wanna come:  send me a saucy email.  Dashboard/Get Up Kids concert at PNC Saturday night.  Sunday will be my recovery day (as the boy will be at his *real* home most of the day), dinner at F.I.S.H. and then a pool party on Monday proper.  Its gonna rock the socks off of last years birthday.  Yayayay!

       P.S. Again   I would also like to say: I have the most amazing, wonderful, creative, awesome and AMAZING artistically talented boyfriend on the planet!  How good  is  he?  So good, that I don't think that there is, in fact, a word to describe his ass kicking-ness (See, he's so good I have to make up words like asskickingness!)  This can only mean one thing:  my snowboard deck is completed and is so rocking that it rocked my face right off.  You should see it, I look pretty silly with out a face!  I will have pics up tonight of it (the snowboard, not my faceless head) and you can all be jealous because no one on the PLANET now has the same deck as me and the only thing that could possibly be hotter than the design he did for me is the design he's gonna do for himself when he gets his own snowboard.    Thank you, Andrew, you're the best (c:

       Just Another Manic Monday   A girls weekend in the Pocconos every once in a while is good for the soul, I assure you.  Its also good that the aforementioned girls weekend involved a lot of Sangria in pretty wine glasses (even if they're plastic), fresh baked cookies, card games, never have I ever and perhaps the filming of the most scandalous (non-pr0n) videotape EVER.  I don't think I've laughed so hard in ages.  Its nice to have girly friends who you're on the same page with.  Outlet shopping also helps this greatly.  Why am I addicted to  urlLink Pacific Sunwear >??  I also heard that the lovely Missy of RFBabies fame and Jeff of  urlLink Ron Fez.net  fame got engaged this weekend on the show.  Congrats to the two of you and best wishes for the happiest, healthiest, kitty & puppy filled life together!  You two deserve nothing but the best!  (c:  One week until my birthday, Happy Birthday today, to my cousin Melissa (not the previously mentioned Missy) and don't forget its  urlLink Anna's  birthday on Wednesday.  Get her somethin' nice!  Remember kids:  its fine at the time, but its a mess in the morning!

       Musings on the News   Did you ever think about the "point" of the news?  Furthermore, have you ever actually sat down and listened to or watched the news?  Seriously, I think the news is a cleverly devised way to satiate everyone's need for gossip, while doing it under the guise of being informative and keeping the public abreast of issues.    If you think about the nightly news stories on your local news broadcast there are stories about the current state of our country, about the war we're fighting in Iraq and then there are the tabloid pages.  People who delve professionally into the lives of celebrities digging up dirt.  Does anyone really care about the details surrounding Marc Anthony's divorce and marriage to Jennifer Lopez?  Does anyone really need to know that teen-queen Lindsay Lohan's father got arrested for fighting with his brother or that she *might* be dating Wilmer Valderamma?  Seriously, if this is all you have to care about in your life or you're even remotely interested in this kind of mindless fodder: I'd like to have the ignorance-is-bliss stress free vacation that is your life.    Once they've covered all that we get to the local stories.  Children's parents fighting at local sporting events, people stealing money from a county office, pedophiles in a church, people fighting to keep a Burger King out of their town because it will "attract the wrong kind of people".  We watch this every night and head in to work the next day to stand around the water cooler and gossip about it.  Inevitably someone in your office will have an "inside scoop" on the story from their "husband's dog's mother's postman's chiropractor" who once sat next to the guy accused of having the house on the block that's an eyesore at Gino's Italian restaurant in Bay Ridge and can attest to the fact that he's a nutbar based solely on the conversation he over heard.    They'll put these stories under the guise of human interest, or a problem-solvers type of story, they'll even file it just under general local news.  None of this really makes us more informed individuals who are now more socially aware of our surroundings and the issues that will affect us everyday.  No, its just made it easy for us to tap into the guilty pleasure of voyeurism.  We can get away with having our nose all up in other people's business with out having to get to know them or feel ashamed for being so nosy.    I know there are people out there ready to offer up the argument "Well aren't blogs basically another form of voyeurism?"  Yes, absolutely.  I don't have beef with the blogs though, because they don't sensationalize every single minute and retarded story like the world is going to end because Jane Smith from Putnam County forged checks on the Board of Educations check stock and deposited them in her own account.  I think the media generally has gotten out of hand, we don't get a fair picture of ANYTHING these days and everything is hounded and blown so far out of proportion in such a disgusting way that I don't find the news even remotely credible these days.  I know as a whole we'll never get a completely accurate picture of events from the news, and I know that it is informative somedays when an issue comes up that was unbeknownst to the public previously, but will seriously affect them.    My point is just the media needs to be put in check.  They need to start reporting responsibly and not just jumping the gun to be the first to break a story.  It doesn't matter if you broke it first if you have none of the details correct.  I believe in our right to know what's going on with our country, but at the same time I'm willing to trust the government (at least one person, somewhere in the government) knows what they're doing and I don't need to hear about all the new behind-the-scenes safety measures.  Didn't you ever think they're behind the scenes for a reason?  This tabloid-fueled peeping Tom media frenzy needs to stop and we need to turn back to a time when there were responsible journalists reporting ACCURATELY on issues that matter to everyone, not just filling an hour with stories that let us our noses in someone else's private life.    This has been my Diva-torial...Thank you!  Whoops, wrong  urlLink place

        French Fries Are Fress Vegitables ! ! !    Batter-coated french fries are a fresh vegetable, at least according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, batter-coated french fries can be considered fresh vegetables. Most other kinds of frozen french fries have been classified that way since 1996.  The USDA explained that this classification applies only to rules of commerce, not nutrition  it's still the fun not ketchup and freis is a 2 vegitable Meal now what the heck is pepper made of is it made of peppers how come peppers don't taste like pepper   and Theres devil fleas out there i dont have them but i hear about them from my freind tina shes all liek the fleas only on the cats and im like that's devil fleas  the end

       A Nice, Long Weekend   I got to take Friday off not for Regan's day of mourning, but because I literally had NOTHING to do and since there would be no mail delivery there would be nothing coming in for me to do either.  My supervisor agreed and since I had the vacation time she let me take the day.  I got my hair done (red again as is my usual now) and just generally vegged out.  Thursday night was pretty crazy 'cause we too Megan to Finn's for the first time.  We all got pretty snotted and it was a good time indeed, but I was a little burnt from that so I stayed in Friday.  No motivation whatsoever to go out.    Saturday was a really nice day so mom and I went to go Stepford Wives.  It was cute and pretty funny and it mocked Connecticut and more specifically my Town (under the guise of "Stepford" of course).  I think the best line was probably "And I thought to myself 'Where could I build a town of robots that nobody would notice?  Connecticut!'".  So, so true, hahaha.  Saturday night Megan, Becki, Stacey and I ended up going up to Danbury for a yummy girls night out dinner and some chit chat that we all needed to catch up on.  Good times indeed.  I learned a valuable lesson that night though:  you can't fit a shopvac and 4 people into a Jetta.  Well, you *can*, but its not very comfortable for people of a Bex and Meggish nature.  (c:  Went to  urlLink the boy's  house for some forestry and a lil MTV movie awards action (he loves Lindsay Lohan).  I think the best part of the show (aside from the Beastie Boys performance) was this commercial that aired during it which showed black people pointing to jewelry saying "bling bling" and eventually a white girl over hears it at school and uses it and then all the white kids are saying it and then their parents are saying it.  It ends with a screed reading "Bling Bling 1997- 2003" it was pretty goddamned funny.  Sunday we went to the Pallisades center to Best Buy and the Apple store and a couple of other places here and there, came home, watched the tube for a lil while and then it was off to hockey, well for the boys at least.  Bex and I had some beers and cheered and watched Reg win his game!  Woo!  He made some pretty good saves, so I'm all proud.    Unfortunately Todd's opponents forfeited so that kinda sucked, but it was no biggie.    that's it.  Pretty boring to read about, but fun to have participated in.  Also: if there is someone on the planet that's *not* playing Halo yet: what the HELL are you waiting for.  I suck at it, but its still pretty fun.  (My guy is pink!  Woooo!)

       Some National Passtime    As promised my watered down rant on baseball (I'm a little lazy to type today so this might not convey the absolute passion with which I truly hate baseball)   Baseball is the lazy man's sport.  Disagree with me if you will, you're entitlted to your opinion, but its the absolute most BORING sport to watch on television, short of somethign like maybe curling.  The whole concept of baseball is even backwards.  Essentially when batting you wait in line to do your thing.  Upon your turn, if you do what you're SUPPOSED to do and hit the ball:  you have to run around in the hot sun, sweat, slide in the dirt, get all smelly.  That sucks.  If you don't do what you're supposed to do and miss the ball you can sit down on the bench, enjoy some gatorade, b.s. with your teammates, chew some sunflower seeds.  Its a party!  Where is the motivation to do well and get the hits?  Oh thats right, there isn't any.    Of all of the athletes in professional sports (the 4 major ones: baseball, basketball, football and hockey) baseball players are the most out of shape (do the words  urlLink Sid Fernandez  mean anything to you?)  Let's not even get me started on the "hotties" of baseball.  Derek Jeter?  Alex Rodrigurez?  Nasty.    Then we get to the fans.  Yanks fans I'm not even gonna pick on you today becuase frankly, I dont have the energy to deal with your arrogant, pigheaded, 'the yankees are the best team ever and I worship them because t.v. tells me its cool to' attitudes today.  Just feel satisfied in the fact that I still hate you just as much as I always have.  I just intensely dislike most baseball fans, mostly because I dislike baseball, so well I guess thats a moot point.  I just think its a boring awful mess and my disdain for it only grew after dating a "baseball history buff" who only ever talked about it and quoted stats about it and historical things that I could really  GIVE 2 SHITS  about so much that it came to the point when he'd open his mouth to say anything (baseball related or not), I'd cringe.  Its not a great game, there is nothing majestic, stoic or heroic about it or its players.  American's love it and it's our passtime because its the lazy mans game and we as a nation are, well, a little bit lazy.    Let the flames begin if you must, but I just hate, hate, HATE it!

       True To My Woochata(tm) Roots   I'm  such  a chick when it comes to sports. That's not to say that I dislike sports, because honestly I really love watching hockey and football and UConn Basketball, but when it comes to choosing teams I like or who I think will win: let the estrogen flow!    I have a few teams that I'm dearly devoted to for hockey its the Rangers, Avalanche and Dallas Stars.  (Though my recent trip to Toronto may cause me to scrap the Avs and Stars and stick with the Rangers & Leafs).  For football I love the Jets and the Titans.  So when one of "my teams" is playing, I'll naturally root for them.  Any other time though I pick with my chach.  That is to say I've played football pools and made sporting bets where I've chosen teams solely on whose uniform colors and or logo I like better, who has the cuter players or who has the more "heart warming" story (dude, I can't help it..Its the hormones).    Anyhow, for the Stanley cup finals I know a lot of the hockey purists wanted Calgary to win as they felt the cup needed to be returned to Canada and it had been over 10 years since a Canadian team had one, and yes, Jarome Iginla is kinda cute in a weird way, but his looks and their "need" for the cup was no match to that of the Tampa Bay Lightning.  First of all I have to say 3 things:  urlLink Martin St. Louis ,  urlLink Vinny Lecavalier  &  urlLink Brad Richards (who is also the Conn Smythe winner,BTW).  My  real  reason for rootin' for the Lightning though, was the fact that  urlLink Dave Andreychuk  has been in the goddamned N.H.L. as long as I've been alive and had never won the cup (correct me if I'm wrong, but I also think he never even made it to the finals...in 22 years?!?).  I'm a sucker for stuff like that so I wanted to see the lil fella win.    Win they certainly did.  I thought it was a pretty scrappy series, lots of good hits, goals and saves and everyone seemed to be "on" the entire time.  Some of the best hockey I've seen in a while (and trust me, lately I've seen a LOT of freakin' hockey).  Anyhow, big ups to the Bolts and tune in tomorrow, same diva time, same diva channel for my rant about why I hate baseball and I think its the biggest, dumbest, suckiest sport ever.  (Aside from my disdain for the Yankees and the legions of their "die-hard" fans who only like them 'cause its trendy to.)

       History of a Boring Town   Some of the folks here in my office decided that today would be "Yearbook Day".   What?   Well, you see they bought a whole bunch of bagels and spreads and juice and candy and set it all up in the conference room and in order to get in and enjoy it you had to bring in your high school yearbook (or wedding or baby photos if you couldn't find your yearbook) so that everyone could see where we all came from.    Far be it from me to pass up a) free food and b) an opportunity to not work so I took one for the team and brought my book in.  I took a lot of flack because I'm the youngest person here aside from the summer interns.  I brought in my yearbook from my Junior year of high school and got lots of "Oh please, you still look the same" or "That doesn't even count...My pets are older than you" kind of comments but all in all it was a pretty fun experience.  Working for a municipal government we have a lot of "Townies" here, so we got yearbooks from my high school that spanned the decades and it was funniest looking through the faculty section and seeing what teachers were still there and how they looked way back when.    It also got me thinking about how much I absolutely  loathe  many of the people I considered "friends" in high school.  There are some whom I genuinely enjoyed (and in some cases still continue to enjoy) their company, but for the most part as I read over all the "we'll always be friends and hang out everyday this summer" messages I cringe a little bit.  I'm fortunate for having a falling out with my high school friends halfway through my first semester at college though I thought it would absolutely be the death of me at the time.  (Can we tell I was a drama queen even from the beginning, LOL)  It allowed me to meet a lot of really great people whom I never would have met otherwise (many of them are even linked to this blog!) and I got to do a lot of things that I enjoyed that weren't quite within the confines of an "ideal", or should I say "stereotypical", act from a twenty-something in my Town.  For this: I'm thankful.  To my real friends: thank you for being by my side and being in my life, you mean more to me than I'll ever let on.    To my faux friends: I appreciate your brief appearance in my life and I hope that I learned something from you.  Thanks for pushing me in a direction I might not have gone without you.

       Friday Free For All   I think my experience last night at the No Doubt/Blink 182 concert can be summed up in the following phrase I overheard someone utter on a cellphone conversation: "I think I'm the oldest person here thats not accompanying a kid, but I'm only 23!"  Wow.  Anyhow, Blink were very funny, very good,  Travis is TOTALLY insane, but there were some akward moments when they started to play some old stuff (and by old stuff I only mean pre-Enema of the State) and they cut out to let the crowd sing and most of the teenyboppers there didn't know the words.  It was a little cringeworthy to say the least.  Also: I'm not exaggerating there must have been about 200+ people there (guys and girls mixed) in BRIGHT PINK blink trucker caps & VonDutch (or VonBitch) shirts.  Seriously, I hate them all and wish scorching cases of the clap for all of them.   Also I'm making a mental note to self:  Kill Ashton Kutcher, he really annoys the everlivingpiss out of me.   No Doubt was acutally really good, they played almost entirely singles, but there were a few old school songs, and I am absolutely enamoured/obsessed with/need to be Gwen Stefani.  Seriously, she fucking kicks ass.  The seats were pretty great **BIG UPS TO ONE BROWN EYED HANK FOR THE TIX!!** and it was a fun time, even if I was awash in a sea of 8th Grade Puberty Love.  It was a fun way to kick of my summer of concerts.   I used to go to shows religiously and I haven't been to one in ages, well, except last summer, but before that it had been like 2+ years.    The rest of the summer concert line up is as follows: June 24: *possibly* (I'm still looking for peeps to go with) Reel Big Fish at Roseland Ballroom June 26: Dashboard Confessional/Thrice/The Get Up Kids at PNC July: The Roots/311 at PNC August 7 or 8: Warped Tour (still finalizing) August 18: Maroon 5/John Mayer at Jones Beach  and a few others which are TBA.  Yeah, so I'm a huge teenybopper/lameass/whatever you wanna call me, but screw you guys I like these bands so eat my butt!    Tonight there is a school benefit with a $20K raffle and open bar that I'll be attending with the lovely OBE Hank, The Future Mrs. OBE Hank, Reg, an assasinated senator and a few others.  Needless to say some sort of debauchery will ensue (photos to come).  The rest of my weekend will probably be spend recouping from Friday, but if you wanna hang out hit me up, no promises, but if I can move: I'll be there.     24 shopping days left until my birthday, hoes.  I love you all so dearly and since my last 2 birthdays ended disastrously I expect some of you to help me kick some ass this year.   I've been a little under the weather the last few days, today being no exception, but I'm trying to make the best of it.  I'm getting better daily at driving stick and I'm averaging 21 miles to the gallon, w00t.  Um...thats really all thats been exciting thats been going on with me.  So I guess I'll end it here.  Oh!  I almost forgot:  CONGRATULATIONS TO: Ian & Katie on the birth of their first child, a son: Rowan Daniel on May 17, 2004 (daddy & baby have the same birthday (c:  ) Andy & Jess on the Birth of their first child, a daughter: Juliet  who was born Tuesday or Wednesday June 1st or 2nd.  (I said it before, I'll say it again...June babies are the best babies!) Happy Belated Birthday to K.C.

       ARRRRRGGGHHHHHH        Some of the funniest times in life are when you have killed a 12 and are hanging with a ferocious pirate who then starts in with Pirate Pick-up Lines, such as:  "Hey Baby...you can Shiver My Timbers any day!" "How 'bout (that) you put your patch on MY eye!?" "Thats not a wooden leg thats my ....." "Yo Ho Blow the Man Down stairs" "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggghhhh you free Saturday night?" "Is there an 'X' on the seat of your pants? Because it appears that there's wond'rous booty buried underneath!"  Thats when Brigadier General Bud Light came and the party was complete.  What an awesome time.

       A Guest Post...Sort of    Apparently my list yesterday inspired the wolf, another nut residing at the Hillcrest Suites to make a list of his own.  It was too big for the comments, but he was kind enough to email it to me and I'll be damned.  Its pretty funny (c:    well well, this is my first comment on the diva site....not sure what's  prompting me to do this, maybe cause my boy one brown eye is officially  a member now, and i know he will read this....anyways, i read your list  diva, and i materialized my own:  Grande soft tacos are the greatest invention of man, with fire and the  wheel coming in a close 2nd and 3rd respectively.  Just when i thought i couldn't like 311 more then i already did, a  sweet ass concert comes along and makes me fall in love with Nick Hexum all  over again.  Ben Franklin once said, "Halo is proof that God loves us."  I am slowly but surely becoming a Hubba's afficianado, next on my list  -> fried clams with chili and cheese .. "i'm SERIOUS!!"  Hornswaggled, hoodwinked, hogwash, bamboozled, and button-hooked are  all fun words to use in every day life.  The Don Labia seems to have some letters missing from his keyboard.  The Hillcrest Girls crack me up.  Taco bell is my crack, and beeks is my dealer.  bAruce (or bruceski) may not be better than tom at halo, but he's  better than tom at life  29 is the truth  that's it, i'm off like a prom dress peace/violence fockers  -wolf

       A Mini-Celebration   Today is  urlLink me & the boy's  sixth monthaversary.    Andrew: I just wanted to say thank you for a really awesome six months, its been a lot of fun and aside from finding an awesome boyfriend I've found someone who ended up being one of my very best friends.  Whether snowboarding, trekkin' around Toronto, going to your hockey games, Halo (even if you *do* always win) or just lounging around the house I always seem to have a great time when I'm with you.  You've made it easy for me to just be me, I'd forgotten how easy that was.  So, as I said earlier, thank you for six months of smiles and here is to the next six.    xoxo, Dey

       WHY GOD???? WHY???????    &nbsp;    Somewhere-In the world,     Police say this was an "Isolated Incident" but others are scared for their lives.    "He was such a great person...Mr. Blue never hurt anyone!&nbsp; Who would do such a thing?" wonders Mr. Blue's next door neighbor Al Cohol(far right)    "Its chilling...makes you fear for your life" said Bud Weiser, local sherriff in these parts.&nbsp; With the 18th Annual Crunk Fest coming to Ale-en Town in less than a month, police officials are now taking precautions to make sure this doesnt happen again.     &nbsp;   "We are starting a furious manhunt to try and capture the cold-hearted person that is responsible for this crime against humanity" said Deputy Anne Heiser.&nbsp; "They wont get away"     &nbsp;   Police say if you have any information to please call 1-888-555-3333.   &nbsp;

       The Final Countdown   Well, that's almost it.  I cleaned out my desk.  Its kind of sad to think that my whole life here at work for the better part of 4 years fits in one small paper box.  Granted I still have tomorrow and Thursday to work, tie up any loose ends and collect anything I may have forgotten, but I have had it pretty good here, the people are annoying (and sometimes gimpy and smelly) but many are a lot of fun, the pay was good (even though I always bitched I wanted more $$) and I didn't really *do* much but blog and chat on aim, which while boring is still pretty cushy, but something about this job just wasn't for me.  Wasn't the direction I wanted to go.  Why is this post so whiny.  Whatever.  I'm not acutally sad to be moving on, I'm glad that I have a chance to get out while I'm still young and can go the direction I want, but I'm just nervous that there is something big I'm either a) forgetting to tell the peopel to do or b)leaving behind at the office.  Oh well, I can always come visit.  Better to be outside lookin' in than inside looking out.

       Weekend Review   Okay First of all (Andrew please avert your eyes for a moment) this was a weekend filled with the following hotties:       Nick Hexum, Jake Gyllenhaal & Matt Damon.  Friday night I had to  urlLink work  until 8:30, but we had a good crew workin' so it was lots of fun (gasp, did I just say working on a Friday night was fun).  After that Andrew and I went to see the Bourne Supremacy.  I enjoyed it.  I thought it was well done, left it open for a third film and of course there was plenty of Matt Damon-y eye candy.  My only complaint about the film (aside from the fact that there was probably eleventybillion people in the theatre with us) was that as Andrew put it, "the camera was a little BlairWitchy", which made me kind of nauseous, but after we'd been home for a bit my stomach finally settled down.    Saturday I came home and I watched some of the Bourne Identity with my mom (who'd never seen it and suprisingly enjoyed it) and I got ready to go to the  urlLink 311  show at P.N.C.  I was excited to see the show as I do like 311 and their opening act was the Roots, which made me all the more excited, but it was nowhere near as close to being as excited as Andrew as they're one of his 2 favorite bands.  Needless to say when his boss stumbled upon 4 V.I.P. tickets for free in addition to the 3 regular seats we'd already purchased he was pretty amped for the show.  Todd, Andrew, my cousin and I headed down to the show to use the new tickets (they also entitled us to some tasty bbq before the show and 3 free beers, even if it was just miller lite, it was free, so it tasted a lil better) and my brother and his chick headed down to use 2 of the tickets we'd had before.  The Roots were pretty great, the bassist tore it up and they really just put on a show that got you amped.  The seats were awesome, you could see everything that was happening on stage with out the use of the monitors and you could even make out facial expressions and stuff...good times.  When 311 came on it was just nuts, as I said earlier I knew I'd enjoy the show 'cause I do like the band, but I wasn't anywhere near as amped as Reg.  They came out, played a ton of songs I knew and loved (Down, Beautiful Disaster, Eons, Random, All Mixed Up, Love Song, Amber, Uncalm) and one new song that I hadn't heard before which was pretty kick ass too.  They kept the crowd's energy up which was cool and it was just a lot of fun, a lot more than I was expecting to have and I would easily put it in the top 5 shows I've ever seen.  Good times indeed.    Sunday Andrew and I grabbed a quick breakfast at the diner than each of us headed of to our own respective jobs & naptimes and met up again later that night.  All in all it was a pretty great weekend.  I certainly had a blast and as if my weekend wasn't good enough, I had a dream sometime last night/this morning about meeting Jake Gyllenhaal in some restaurant/ice house in like Minnesota or Alaska or something and he was broken up with Kirsten Dunst and wanted to hang out with me 'cause my friend Adam met him in Japan and told him I was cool.  Wishful thinking?  Sure, but it was nice while it lasted.  (c:  That'll do it for now, catch ya on the flipside, childrens!

       HOW 'BOUT THAT!?          Well, another year older. I have received the rank of Pops Jr. and will serve the regime proudly. I heard that a certain concert Satruday night was pretty damn awesome. I got droonk and did the lindy hop. All in all the birthday was good and presents were plentiful.   Sometimes I feel like I live a double life due to my living at "The Suites" and then going to Breezy every weekend. Totally different worlds I guess. Enough ramblings from me. The picture you see above is from    urlLink HALO 2"  which is going to kick major hiney when it circulates on November 9, 2004.   Hank would also like to take the time to thank The Diva, Reggie Roo, Pops K, Viceroy and Beekxs for their continued support through evil forest that lies ahead. Thanks guys!   Ok...now for this week's $1,000,000.00 question.   There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do?

He's a very kick ass, cool dude and he cracks me up on a consistent basis so you all are gonna enjoy it (or else I'll come personally kick your ass myself!)  His profile will be up in the next few days so you can learn more about this man of mystery.  I'm sure you'll all be waiting with baited breath, so to satisfy your curiosity I leave you with this shot of the man, the myth, the legend in his mask:

       Turn And Face the Strain   Okay, so a few changes around here, the black was getting boring and it had been a while since I'd updated the site so I figured eh, why the hell not.  Also, we may be taking on another writer to the site so *hopefully* look for that in the near future.  We should probably get a more manly domain other than "dynamitediva", but well, what can you do, way back when this was a one-diva show.  Alright, I'll give you all a real post tomorrow.

       No, I'm  NOT  Pregnant   I'm just in the mood for some garlic mashed potatoes and maybe one or 2 spears of some yummy deli pickles, a little lobster bisque soup, some of my  urlLink Target  cookies with all the icing that someone (ahem, Reginald)ate, cotton candy and some mint iced tea and maybe a mojito or 2...or 8.  Oh and some pizza fries would be yummy too, round it out with a bowl of short sticky rice and some cucumber salad and maybe an order of spinach from  urlLink F.I.S.H.  and I'd be able to die happy right now.  Wait, acutally, I'd need to throw down with some serious BBQ ribs and cornbread as well then.  Yeah...I think that's it.    Somehow the reason I can't lose any weight remains a mystery to me, go figure!

       Hello, My Name is Deja and I'm An Addict           Halo, its consuming my will to live.  Well, not really, but I spend the majority of my free time playing it with Beex and the boys at Hillcrest Suites.  I have 2 guys(both are pink).  I'm starting to get better and jus trying to stay low on the radar and hopefully I'll be able to just hide out and snipe people.  There is nothing more satisfying that a single headshot to take a bitch out.    This weekend I traded in my game cube and Andrew and I both traded in some games and we had enough credit to get a second XBox for the house.  This one's name is Stumpy, but I call it Stimpy in honor of the fabulous Stimpson J. Cat.  We linked Stumpy and the Caboose and now we can have 8 people playing at one time.  It rocks.  I hope One Brown Eyed Hank comes home sometime soon so we'll be able to get 3 vs. 3 going and some capture the flag or something cool like that.  When I stand in the shower at Andrew's house the pipes make this weird sound like when you're by one of the portals.  Sometimes his washing machine sounds like that too.    I haven't played in about 10 hours.  I'm starting to get the shakes.  I don't know if I can make it.  In other exciting video game news I went to this store (where we got the XBox from) and I bought 2 games for the original Nintendo: Ducktales (stop laughing, thats my fave Nintendo game ever!) and Battle Toads. Ducktales was $9.99 but the games were buy 1 get 1 free so I got them both for $10. Not too shabby.  Thats all for now.  I'll be back laters.

       J.B. III     Well, the 2 songs from John's funeral mass just played back to back on the radio and then I realized that today is the six month mark of his death.&nbsp; I can't believe its been six months since he passed.&nbsp; I can't even believe really that he has passed.&nbsp; When I think of him I just think that he's still away at school and I get ready to ask my brother something about him and then I remember.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The last six months have been an interesting one.&nbsp; So much has happened, but so much has stayed the same.&nbsp; Something in my brother is different though, as obviously he's lost his best freind.&nbsp; In the last year he's lost more of his innocence and naievete than he should have had to.&nbsp; He's not innocent by any means, but he's really had a rough year and his choices don't seem to be getting any better.&nbsp; Especially his new taste in freinds.&nbsp; They're awful people.&nbsp; Its easy to say that John was much better a friend now that he's passed, but seriously, we knew John forever and we knew he was good people and I guess that made it easier for us to overlook his flaws, but John was a good person.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm sorry that this is kind of a downer entry, but I just needed to write this.&nbsp; John, please keep looking out for Jay, he needs your guidance more now than he ever has and we all miss you and you often cross our minds.&nbsp; R.I.P.

I've been at work since 8 a.m. I'll be working straight through non-stop until 8:30 tonight.  Upon my arrival at Hillcrest Suites the consumption of the SoCo & Lime shots will begin.  Do you accept my challenge?  What say you, rogue?  - The Diva

       Finally, Some Down Time!   Okay I've put in a full, busy morning here at the office and decided I've earned a break to blog or rant or maybe just recap stuff.  I'm not really sure where this post will go, but I'm just going to put up what comes to mind.     urlLink Becca  wrote a post, kindly, or not so kindly asking people to "STFU" and I laughed my butt off.  It was a much needed laugh, so, thank you for that.  Hehe.  I haven't had much of a chance to even read anyone else's blogs so I'll have to try and find some more time to do that (maybe after my lunch hour when everyone else is out of the office).  I got re-hired at  urlLink Starbucks  so I'm officially a full fledged  urlLink coffee wench  again.  My first shift is today after I'm done here at my first job (I'm going to be piggy backin' these 2 jobs for the next 12 business days, working from 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. M-Th...Needless to say I'm gonna be in an AWESOME mood).  It's going to be a pain to make it through, but I'll have some extra cash and I won't have any time to spend any of it so though it seems sucky it'll be beneficial in the long run.    This last weekend was a lot of fun, my friend  urlLink Billy (jk, dude)  had a party on Friday, so that was fun.  Saturday was the infamous "Duckapalooza" which was a lot of fun.  Andrew plays for a hockey team called the "Great Big Ducks" and at the end of every year the team has a party (hence the name).  It was great.  It was at this AMAZING house on the water and there was a jumpy castle, face painting, kegs, margaritas, incredible food, an ice cream man and just a ton of really nice, really cool people.  All guys from the hockey team and their wives and kids.  Bex and Todd came with us so it was cool.    I took off early and went up to Mahopac with Megan and Ashley.  We were supposed to go see one of Meg's friends, Greg, fill in with this band.  Unfortunately the owner of the bar (a fat drunk old mess) decided he didn't like the sound of the opening act (a mix of tool and korn sounds) so he didn't do the polite thing and ask them to stop playing (or even let them finish their set and just not ask them back), nope.  First he turned the jukebox on over them to try and drown them out, but they kept playing, and then he just walked over to them and turned the power off in the bar.  It was quite possibly the rudest thing I've ever seen in my life.  As if that wasn't lame enough, he called the cops and told them there was a fight at the bar (now for a bunch of 20somethings we were very calm) no one was screaming, no one was yelling, everyone was just chillin' and trying to be respectful, finish our drinks and then bounce.  So 12 cops roll into the bar expecting some sort of riotous environment and they find nothing.  So we all leave the bar and hung with the cops in the parking lot for a few minutes (they agreed the guy was a douche) and well, they were hot, so who were we to leave eye candy early?    Sunday Andrew I and went to brunch, which was quite yummy.  We sunned for a bit at my cousin's pool and watched the Butterfly Effect, and it wasn't quite the crapfest I was expecting.  It wasn't the greatest movie ever, and the ending sucked, but it was disturbing and not too bad, (even if it did have Ashton Kutcher in it).  It was still better than "Lost in Translation".  I think that's about it, so yeah that was cool.  I am so happy right now, not right this second per se, as I'm at work (boo!), but in general.  It scares me to say that 'cause I don't want to jinx any thing, but I can't remember being this satisfied with my situation as I am now in a long time.  I am surrounded daily by great, true friends, my family, an absolutely amazing boyfriend (with whom I become more smitten every day).  I'm doing things, I'm smiling, I'm taking care of what I have to get done and I'm finally almost dug out of this rut I have been in since I got dismissed from UConn four years ago.  To feel like the possibility for anything is out there is really exciting (wow that sounds hokey).  I dunno, I just needed to gloat a little because really, I don't think I've got much I can complain about.    Take care kiddies and I'll catch ya on the flipside!

       Just Stoppin' By        Not much to say other than another fabulous weekend with Andrew, Megs, Bex, Ashley and the rest of the crew.  Here's a pic of Andrew and I from Duckapalooza 2004 (if I'm motivated I'll blog about it later.  Yes, I realize I'm blogging now, but I don't feel like typing a lot.  This is getting lengthy isn't it?[GET ON WITH IT!] Ok, ok I'm going)  Not the best quality ever, but thats what happens when my lazy ass scans a really dark photograph and just tries to halfass lighten it up.  I probably should have just emailed Andrew or Megan to fix it in Photoshop as thats basically their jobs, but it'll do for now.

       Lost In A Sea of Crap   Last night the manpiece and I finally got around to watching Lost in Translation.  It was so hyped from all of the people who'd seen it and by T.V. and so I figured it was worth a watch.  Andrew wasn't too into watching it, but he caved 'cause I suffered through Dreamcatcher for him.  Now maybe its just Andrew and I, but honestly we thought it sucked.  It was painfully slow, only moderately funny at best, there was no release, no real point.  Its just a couple more hours of my life gone, that I can't have back.  Maybe I'm some ignorant rube who doesn't get the "big picture", but seriously: what a boring, unentertaining waste of my time.    I keep having really violent nightmares at night and I can't sleep well.  They've even started to wake Andrew up 'cause I've started talking aloud.  Well, I dunno if I'm talking, but I'm definitley making sounds like mumblign or something.  I'm also nervous 'cause I started taking some medication that's supposed to make me violently ill.  I know other people who've taken this medication and they can attest to how sick you get.  They even gave me meds at the hosptial to counteract the nausea, but I haven't had to use one.  I'm scared the medicine might not be working, eeek!  Anyhow thats all that's new here.  You chicken fuckers better start leaving me comments even if I am boring, becuase I hate having no comments.  Poop!

       Observations from Cube 2   My desk for some wierd reason smells like soy sauce and I'm salivating Pavlov's Dog style for some sushi right now.  Short sleeved, button-down work shirts that are seas too big for you and worn tucked in look atrocious.  Increase this atrocity expotentially by the number of colors in your ugly assed tie.  My office will find any excuse to party.  Today we're closing the office to have lunch at a little trattoria within walking distance called Tavola.  When we return which will proabaly be no earlier than 2:30 we'll be having cake for my bosses birthday.  By time those festivites wind down it should be well on its way to 3:30 at which point everyone starts shutting things down in order to "blow this pop stand" at 4 p.m. promptly.  It's days like today that I think I'll miss the "efficiency" of the goverment that myself and fellow absent lunch-going coworkers help to achieve every day.  I honestly think I might be partied out.  Seriously the last 2 weeks are just an absoulte blur of booze, beer, green smoke, sleepless nights and days wasted sleeping all afternoon (not that I'm complaining, mind you) I just wish I could get back on some sort of normal schedule.    Some freak in my office has decided to do away with the  urlLink WCBS 880 newscast  playing in the office on the radio and put on some "Lite FM" crap.  My ears have been assaulted afternoon by the forced strains of Michael Bolton and Michael McDonald.  Please someone tell me the quickest way to deafen myself.  (Damn me for leaving my iPod at home today!)

       We've Got A Pulse   Apologies lil lovelies for the lack of posting.  Its absolutely insane here at work (July is always the "busy" month for me) and I only have 18 days of proper work here left (23 if you want to count the total number of days from now til the 29th).  I'm not sure that I'll get around to writing much in the next few days, but I'll try.  I had a really stellar weekend with the most amazing boyfriend ever and lots and lots of really great friends.  I have decided to go back to  urlLink slingin' lattes  as a part time solution to supplement this job's income and give me something to do so I'm not totally unemployed.  Oh yeah, plus tips from that job, so don't forget to tip your cute, lil redheaded baristas.  :p  I think thats it for me, nothing too great to blog about, hopefully the Don will come through with somethin' big and give us a post or 2 in my down time, but he's been quite busy as of late as well, building pools, burying bodies, you know...the usual.  Also, congratulations are in order for Tina, John & Tristan Bentley on welcoming the newest member of their family, Seth Michael Bentley into the world.  Seth, was born on June 28th, so you know he's gonna be a good egg (c:

Seems that the Suites is gettin a classy upgrade.  The inclusion of 26 bottles of wine and two, count 'em, two wine racks to house those bottles provide what the French call a 'Certain I Dont Know What'.  Next thing ya know we will be holding the 1st Annual Hillcrest Suites Wine & Cheese Party.  I can see it now.  Tuxedo's, Dresses....Pinkie out!  Also, the Great Viceroy presented Hank with an awesome birthday present.  Pictures are to follow.  I can not describe it, you just gotta see it.  Aight people.  I am outie like a Saudi.  Enjoy yo weekend!

       A Divalicious Update   Howdy my lil bloggy babies.  I havent had much time to chat, catch up on your blogs or even post here since I've been slingin' latte's full time, but its good for me.  So far in this last week I've lost 5 lbs.  I am always on my feet running around instead of being sedentary behind a desk all day and I don't have to worry 'bout my arms 'cause repeatedly lifting gallons of milk is good for buildin' biceps.  To hell with the gym:  I'm gonna go do some milk curls!   Haha.  Anyhow, Projekt Revolution tour last friday was pretty cool.  Less Than Jake and the Used were good, it sucked that more people weren't into them.  Snoop was pretty good (even if he *did* think he was at Jones Beach and not PNC), Korn.  God, Korn rocked my fucking face off (no, they weren't the headliners, wtf!) and they did a really kick ass cover of the Wall.  Rock on Jonathan Davis, you kilt wearing -tearing shit up- badass mothafucka!  Linkin Park I really hate.  I probably hate them more now that I've seen them live than I did prior to this, but there was one cool part of their set:  Jay-Z.  Yes, Jay-Z.  Hova, Jigga, Sean Carter, whatever you wanna call him.  He came out on set and did 3 songs with LP.  No, none of them was 99 problems.  He did "Dirt off your SHoulder", "Big Pimpin" and soemthing else that was good, but for some stupid reason I can't recal right now.  The hillcrest luau was the party of the fucking year.  We pulled it off it rocked everyone in attendance agreed it was the most festive of all festivals.  What is it about tiki torches, hawaiian shirts and jungle juice that really gets people partying?  What happened at the Luau stays at the Luau so if you missed it I guess you'll just have to wait patiently for the invite to next year's bash.    Other than that, I've just been working and watching Andrew play hockey, so I guess that'll do it for this installment.  I promise to catch up with all of you as I'll only be at work until 10 a.m. tomorrow (see, going in at 5 a.m. *does* remotely have its benefits...who am I kidding!) so I'll catch you all on the flipside.  Be good and send me emails (dynamitediva628 at yahoo dot com) so I can feel special.  I promise to write back to 'em.  Love you all!  *mWaH!*
