      I've finally given up on finding e password for my old blog and decided to create a new one. so guys pls forget bout tt one.  juz started my training for vertical marathon next year(gotta beat tt gino guy, yeah!) ran to toa payoh blk 154 and did 10 sets. wah damn tired after that, could hardly even stand. but this is a small price to pay to be in tip-top condition. the first 2 were a breeze but by e time i reached 7, my whole left thigh cramped up and i was left writhing in pain on e floor. so embarrassing as sum residents gave me weird looks. but luckily it was only 8+ 9am on a sunday morning, so not many ppl. but aniwae i went for breakfast afta tt and came back to complete my remainin 3 b4 runnin back home to bishan.  aftanoon was an even worse day. went to play street soccer at a nearby court and ended up wif a fight. sum indian guy claimed my fren was making passes at his gf and he wanted him to apologize. apparently, his gigantic ego got e betta of him and he told e guy to FO. traded sum blows b4 sum1 broke it up, so now got sum bruises here and there but nth broken. sum unlucky ones had bloody noses, cut lips and black eyes. so lesson 2 be learned? alwayz protect ur face... haha nahz juz kiddin...

      2dae cj odac took part in a competition called urban escape. we faced tough competition frm ppl frm other jcs, polys, ites. it was difficult to win, and we did not not expect much of it. however, when i heard frm rao tt walter's grp came in 5th, i felt extremely proud of them and happy for them. but still sum times things are always so near yet so far. everyone i'm sure did their best and would've learnt sum thing frm this experience, and form stronger bonds wif one another. it's a pity tt i couldn't take part in it, cuz my team needs me, but i promise u all i'll be there next year.  had one of e best games in my life 2dae. made dozens of successful passes and interceptions, prob cuz e other team's playmaker was havin a bad dae, tt's why it made me look gd. playin deep in midfield in frnt of e 2 centrebacks is no easy task, had 2 cover bout 1/4 of e pitch myself and by e end of 1st half, i was completely beat, but extremely satisfied wif e team's performance so far. we managed 2 create numerous chances but unable 2 beat e gk. but sadly 1 of our strikers lost his cool and got himself sent off for a horror tackle on e gk late in e second half. frm den on, we were unable 2 attack but managed 2 hold them 2 a nil-nil draw which i was quite disappointed wif. given our excellent 1st half, i thot we had a chance of beating last yr's champs. but well, nth's fair in this world, we juz gotta accept this fact and move on. but still good work guys, keep it up.  went for my 10km run in e evening 2dae, and one thing i've discovered is tt it's not easy. ran to bishan stadium 4 e run but unfortunately, 2dae happens 2 mark e return of my not-so-gd fren, "mr shin splints". it hurt like hell, but i managed to hit 49min20sec for 10km. not bad, but not gd enuff. dunno if i shld continue 2 train everydae, xp is cuming. shld i rest till my splints recover? or continue and run it off like last time? i really dunno. i mean, it was so bad until i could barely stand after e run, but i think it'll go away once i build my foundation leg muscles. ¿wAdEvA~! guess i'll juz keep training till i drop frm exhaustion, juz hope tt'll be after xp...

      2dae's training was wonderful. been a long time since we all ran in e rain together as a whole odac. it felt good. monica was oso very funny in e way she led us. everyone enjoyed e dae quite a bit, i think. mr lim den had another chit-chat session wif us, teaching and refreshing us on sum mountain river and island knowledge. overall it was a very enriching experience. hopefully our future trainings can be equally satisfying.  but during e session, mr lim mention of his fren yugi or smth. he was popping painkillers like motivational food juz 2 reach e summit of a mt. while most laugh at tt thot, i wasn't. i remembered at benum where e pain got so bad, i was popping panadol like candies. i've won my battle against painkillers and to a lesser extent cigarettes b4. but this time round, it would definitely be harder this time round, now tt i'm doin it alone. moreover, e constant headaches and injuries seem 2 encourage me 2 use them. how do i fight this shit?

      youth dae 2dae but still went early 2 try 2 squeeze off 10rounds b4 assembly. was veri motivated 2 haf prashan pace me 4 e first 8 laps. it really cuz me 2 respect this guy even more than b4. e first round i was running behind him and den he turned arnd and said "cum on, i'm not running tt fast, overtake me(or smth liddat). running 10 laps? ok, i'll pace u. 1.25 per round is a gd pace 2 start wif." thank u, cuz it really shows how much he cares for his frens. though we are not veri close, we are juz in e same f math lecture and i might be joining x-country, i dun know him tt well, i'll try to learn more frm this guy. his mental strength and determination is remarkable. i'm considering asking him to join odac, cuz frankly speaking i find his talent wasted. cuz he'll be unable 2 take part in many competitions incl nationals x-country due 2 his age, so he can join sum other kinds of competitions wif us. besides he is a useful addition 2 our team esp when it involves running, since he's e best in our sch.  2dae i realised how fragmented our odac is. i mean yah, most ppl got other commitments and stuff but i juz get e feelin tt we are on e verge of breaking apart. 3 gals went 2 watch movie, another 3 went 2 watch e same one at a diff time. sum of e guys stayed 2 play soccer and bsketball, others juz went mia. i'm not blaming anyone or anything whatsoever, but i can't remember e last time we went out together as a whole odac. i feel tt there are more and more cracks appearing, let's juz hope tt we can try to mend it asap, b4 we all collapse.  played sum proper field soccer wif sum of e odac guys this evening. but one thing i realised is tt i'm no longer able 2 turn past sum1 as fast as b4 animore. even b4 e game, my heels and knees were already hurting frm e mornin run. but e most unlucky thing happened arnd e 1/8th mark when i tried to dribble past sum1. wif my back towards him, i made a body feint 2 e left b4 spinning 2 e right hoping 2 catch him off-guard. but jus as i was accelerating as i was turning, i rammed straight into his shoulder. i dropped 2 my knees in a complete daze, only able 2 watch blood start dripping down frm my nostrils and staining e grass. i stood out e next 5 min of e game onli 2 come back on ltr and get rammed in e face by e ball. i was again dazed and blood was dripping and staining e grass below frm my nose and this time cut lip. now, my nose still hurts and so does my jaw. hope it goes away by tml. cuz it's usually gone like 1/2 hr, but this time it's not. hope it's not smth serious. but one thing i've noticed is tt i seemed 2 haf changed my style of play. i no longer am tt fired up and reckless, lunging in and making stupid horror tackles. however, i feel tt my overall game has thus deproved. but i can't play well without e influence of strong emotions like anger, but on e other hand, these r my frens, amateurs. not playin for a living, dunno how 2 protect themselves frm injuries. well, i guess i'll jus haf 2 keep my best till it's really needed.

      had quite a rude awakening 2dae. been training for e last month or so, and my confidence on my physical fitness kinda got too high. so when i saw prashan doin 1.15laps for 15 rounds, and francis easily kicking my ass during todaes morning run of 18 laps; i was put in my place. it felt awful. i felt like shit. i realised it has onli been abt a month's time and prashan has improved like miles, while i barely did. maybe i'm not training enuff. i was considering increasing my distance to 100km a week from 70km for sum time now, and maybe it's time to do so. maybe i shld find sum1 to run wif, i dunno. we'll see.  usually i was able to run finish my daily run without any pain, tt'll come onli after e whole thing when i stop. however, this morning's 18laps was a killer. at least frm e 12th lap onwards. my knees felt like jelly and i couldn't really control them, as they felt alienated frm my main body. moreover, my heels started to hurt like *toot* again. i felt my heel bone rubbing into my worn-out heel tissue throughout e remaining part of my run. and after e run i could not even put any pressure on my heels due 2 e excruciating pain. why is this happening? can sum1 pls tell me? could it be becuz i'm losing focus? or is my mental strength weakening? i went to bishan stadium to do my daily rounds in e evening and could not even make it to 18. why?  i haf a few reasons to be training so hard. e most impt is to prove 2 myself tt i can do wadeva i set my heart to. e others include 2 join x-country and be 1 of e top runners in school. but now is e most impt question: how many more? how much longer can i go? can i achieve wad i set out 2 do? am i losing my focus? cuz now, e reason tt's keeping me on e track is an outlet 4 me 2 forget my problems, to take my mind off sum things. i dunno animore.

      2dae's training was much better, maybe due 2 e fact francis and mr lim arnd? i dunno. but e atmosphere is there again, and i thoroughly enjoyed 2dae's training. however mr lim mentioned abt a lot of things tt set me thinking. esp e part bout e dangers our batch faces.  firstly abt formation of clics and outcasting sum others. i admit, i'm guilty as charged. i'm sure sum of u all noe who i dislike a lot in odac and i often make no attempt to hide it either. even though mr lim saes these ppl need a chance to redeem themselves, it's easier said den done. i'm sry if i remain unchanged in this aspect, but I'm not a person who's easily impressed, so once u r in my outcast list, well all I can sae is prove me wrong. if u haf a good personality, i'll still treat u equally.  secondly abt sum "fitter" ppl who lose focus and onli concern abt fitness, competitions, 2.4km, thus neglecting those weaker ones. guilty again, even though I won't consider myself fit. I noe i've been pestering lots of ppl esp walter, yiyong, galvin to take 2.4km timings for e past few weeks ever since xp. i've suggested tough trainings and jus yesterdae proposed we do circuit training. yes, I noe i've been acting like an ass recently and I'm starting to get on e nerves of sum. I'm really sry if I appear to u like sum cocky bastard or obnoxious brat hu thinks he's very fit. I jus wanna haf trainings where we can push ourselves 2 e limit so tt we can improve and become more solid ppl, if not at least atheletes. but I agree tt I may haf been a little overboard and lost e whole idea, so dun worry i'll keep my mouth shut e next time I haf sum stupid ideas k?  btw, I wanna really sae sry to rao. i noe it's e i-dunno-how-many-th time i've been sayin this but still i feel real bad for whacking my gd fren in e face liddat. we were playin soccer afta training and I accidentally slammed e ball into his face shattering his spec lens. i was damn scared shards would end up in his eye or smth but luckily he was ok. thank god. but really rao, i didn't mean it, but if u want or ur parents sae anything i'll pay for ur new glasses. it's e least i can do. i juz hope tt u r alright, if u want 2 u can always slam a ball in my face if it makes u feel better k? i mean it.

      2dae's training was damn slack. ran generator route den played walter's pull-up game. 100 pull-ups/push-ups + 120 situps/inclined. still within our limits, which i feel is quite gd, this shows our weakest link is actually not tt weak, cuz no one dropped out or anithing of tt sort. however i feel tt e most impt thing was lacking frm e training -- discipline. i mean it's nice to see everyone enjoying themselves and stuff, but frankly e whole training was jus a session for talking cock and laughing for sum. this atmosphere is felt more significantly during e discussion. ok, this is where i haf 2 make an apology. i'm really sorry for being a complete ass todae, jus lazing arnd and not involved in e discussion. i admit tt i was bored and restless, partly due 2 e atmosphere and e lack of action and adrenalin. jus sum lame excuses, but for tt i'll do 10 more rounds later + 50 pushups, 50 situps. but e feeling 2dae was not of an odac training, which i fear could be a problem in e future. everyone takes it too easy, always Argue, Bargain, Complain, Demand. i miss e authority of francis, alwaes there in e past 2 keep us in line and focus on e more impt things. mr lim said bcuz of tt, he was forced to hang out more wif e j1s as he treats e j2s like his employees and likes 2 do things without their consultation. not many ppl likes this style, but i feel tt for such a huge bunch of us, we need sum1 to stamp his authority. sum1, whom everyone respects or fears, to lead us. if not it's quite hard 2 get anithing done. tt was one of e reasons why i suggested to walter tt we do sum circuit training to get back into training mode after xp. at first he was agreeable on e idea, however sum others jus came up sum lame excuses like floor is wet, tml got more training etc. frankly speaking if we are to keep this up, i think we can forget abt training, there's no pt animore. i think it's time to wake up and smell e shit ppl. u want ppl to respect us, u want others to praise us or anithing, time to train hard and improve e shitty attitude.

      yesterday went to help out at e streetwise run as endpt marshall. at first wasn't planning to go cuz of sum other commitments, but in e end decided 2 forgo them mainly cuz of sum external factors. jus reached e place when liyun called 2 sae tt she was at e mac's and wasn't sure how 2 get 2 e place. so galvin and i decided to run there to find her. but less than 1.5km later galvin is out of breath as he had jus finished a packet of nasi lemak. so wat 2 do? solve it loh. no choice so i continued alone, not quite sure where e mac's is. nearly 1/2 hr later and prob bout less than 6km, i finally reached e mac's. on e return journey, we took abt 1 hr walk. durin this time, she spent all on her phone. i jus kept quiet and continued walking, jus trying to shut out e pain frm my heels. come to think of it, i dun think we spoke a single word to each other e whole dae. if u planned for things to be so hostile, u might as well tell me to take e contract and get out of ur life, rite? ¿wAdEvA~!  at night went to stay over at yiyong's hse 2 watch e final of euro. 13ppl and his brother stared at e flickering tv screen at an unearthly hour to watch 22 men chasing after a ball; things jus could not get more exciting than this. and everyone's heart sank xcept me and wei xiang when angelos charisteas nodded in e winner. we could hear all e cursing arnd and e most upset was bryan in his portugal jersey, stoning in front of e tv. but 4 me e wierd part of e nite began jus b4 e match.  sumhow while we were talking trash, e topic came to be abt ghosts and e supernatural. premunitions was one of e things discussed. remember when sum1 seemed 2 haf said sumthing b4 and u jus noe wad he'll sae next? or e time when u jus noe where ur frens would sit at a table, jus like e way u saw in a dream? well, after e match we all went up to yy's room to crash. in e middle of our sleep, i received a msg frm my fren saying sum shit bout e match. i read it and deleted it. but e thing was tt when i woke up at arnd 8+, i had a new msg. e exact same one frm my fren. as i'm quite a light sleeper and my ringtone would prob wake everyone up in e room. so i was kinda freaked esp since i remembered readin and deletin it. maybe i remembered wrong...

       i hate e pain in my legs. can't they jus leave me alone? tried running 15 laps this morning at 1.25/lap. quite confident i could do it. went very well, 6 laps were all ahead of time and i wasn't even sweating yet. however while rounding a corner on e 7th, i turned my knee awkwardly and was forced to stop. it so totally sux. den, first 2 periods pe. went 4 warm up run alone until my class came, but after e 4th round everyone started following me. gd as it is, i felt quite pressurised for i dunno wad reason. den e guys had 2 run round e sch 3 times. led in front all e way, and every time i passed anyone, i pushed harder and kept a smile on my face, even though my body was screaming to my brain. nvr show weakness in frnt of others. onli this way will others think u r invincible and will lose e mental battle b4 it even begins. came back frm 2.9km in abt 10+min. yy came back a few secs later. wad does this prove? i may be gd enuff in e sch, but i'll get trashed outside. now, my heel injury is working up and i could barely get up and walk after sitting down on e bus. even in resting position, my legs are trembling uncontrollably and in constant pain. how can i reach my dream of being e best runner in cj? at first i thot there was onli prashan and ganeshan. now got another guy joining x-country, pb 830. pressure is building. wad makes prashan wad he is now is natural talent and hardwork. both of which i haf none, so i'm trying to make up wif sheer determination and perserverance. everyone keep asking me to stop running, can u all at least respect my decision of training harder? i noe my body best, i can take this. cuz at first i use these comments to motivate myself to prove you all wrong, tt i can be better than others even wif an injury. however, now it onli saps my morale and my mental vice over my physical body is weakening. i need to regain my confidence back if i were to make e x-country team, if not i'll probably slack arnd avoiding physical and stuff in odac, and nvr be sumbody. but i'll take my chance to gain it back at e real run. i'll come in top 20, if not i'll stop running. i hope tt next time if u all see me on e track running, u'll encourage me or jus leave me alone, jus let me maintain e aura of e crazy hardcore runner frm odac in frnt of others.    &nbsp;   "pain is temporary, glory is forever..."

       tried 2 hit my pb this evening for 10km. been sumtime since i went for timings. hit a miserable 46.13. totally rubbish. how do i be e best wif this kind of shit? it's a wakeup call for me 2 train harder, cuz ever since sch reopened, my weekly distance dropped frm 7 to less than 5. muz put in effort 2 make it a pt 2 train everydae regardless of weather, time or venue. gonna start tmr, hit at least 5 laps b4 joining julia @ arnd 7 for another 10 or so. den maybe another 15 or so after sch. i still cannot clear those words spoken by sum1 during mass pe tt dae. "these odac ppl, run so fast oso no use, in e end oso slack arnd while others do grandstand." it was spoken by my very own classmate, when he saw me and yy doin dips instead of grandstands after aggravating our injuries during e earlier run. it cut me real deep. i anticipated tt when a fellow classmate and odac member went up 2 jason liu after seeing both of us do tt. e reason? flu and phlem. i feel very ashamed for tarnishing odac's reputation when i pulled myself out of doin e grandstands. now i feel even more ashamed for havin brought in this wuss into odac onli 2 let him tarnish e reputation further. forgive me guys. i promise it wun happen again. cannot oso muz can.

       firstly i want to thank e man who invented gel cushioned heel supports. thanks to u, i'm now able to run wif reduced pain in my heels. damn, it feels much better now. oso bought new pair of racer. xbknn light sia. feels almost like i'm flying when i run now. hope tt it'll help me sum in e upcoming realrun. finally went back to see e team train afta god-knows-how-long. e first thing i realised, even though we r still gd frens, i no longer feel e same passion 4 e game as them animore. i no longer am 100% soccer fanatic. i still like soccer, but now there seems to be things more appealing than it. went 2 see e doc again 4 e followup. he told me tt e x-rays show tt my right lung is slightly disfunc and i'm relying on my left for 70% of e air, tt's why i've been suffering frm chest pains when i run. cuz i push my lungs 2 their limits. he advised tt i shld stop running both cuz of my injuries and lungs (WTH?). he even suggested i'm not fit for ns (WTF?). jus how ironic and interesting my life will become in e future?

       tried out ankle weights 2dae. damn xiong. after 5 rounds my right thigh cramped. 2 rounds later my left calf cramped. felt my muscle tense up a lot more than usual even when walkin. den had pe.did 5 stations. totally sux 2 da core. onli&nbsp;a frm sit n reach, 66 and situp 51. shuttle run 10.30, b. can't sprint 4 nuts. pullup 7, c i think. den jump 220, a fucking d lah. totally sian diao. but at least get 2 play soccer afta tt. e rest of e dae quite boring. stoning thru most of e dae. onli afta lessons den e fun begins. not much, but betta den none. a no of us stayed back 4 physics lesson wif mr lim. went swimming in e evening, realised i strained my right arm. prob during my workout in e gym after school. hurts loads but still tolerable. still managed 2 swim&nbsp;15 laps wif onli 1 arm but @ a damn slow pace.    &nbsp;  was talking to zy. once again she told me 2 stop, like tt's gonna work! she seemed quite sad, cuz she could not run 4 sum time due 2 her injuries. she didn't want me 2 end up like her. it's quite painful 2 watch her grimace in pain whenever she ran. it's not very fair 4 a person like her 2 go thru such a serious setback. but i realli believe u shld go 4 e scan. at least u'd noe wad is realli gg on. i nvr realli listened 2 anyone's advice b4, but i'll make an exception. i'll stop 4 a while,&nbsp;after real run k? but in e meantime, u shld rest and jus rmb tt me and e rest of odac will alwaes be there 4 u. dun keep ur problems 2 urself.

       yesterdae had a short odac training early in e morning. was supposed 2 take 2.4km time-trial and 25 gst at 0700hrs. started pouring heavily b4 we could even properly warm up. so e whole bunch of us went 2 e gym. managed 2 get sum workout, b4 we decided 2 run again. e rain started again b4 completing our first lap. we were told by michael tan 2 stop. we jus sat at e grandstand and stone. i'll like 2 apologise 2 ian and everyone else 4 suddenly walkin away wif galvin 2 e gym. but i was very pissed, i had a gd lap timing(1.10), besides rain doesn't bother me. e feeling sucked. went back 2 e grandstand afta a while 2 see everyone runnning on e track. we quickly flew down e granstand and prepared 2 run, w/o warmup--big mistake. left my knee guards in class e dae b4--bigger mistake. e rounds went by rather quickly, frm my pt of view it was. when i looked at my watch as i'm 3 steps away frm e finish, i opened my hands like an airplane and ran thru. 8.59. e feeling was gd, esp noeing i finished ahead of galvin. but still unable 2 break his pb of 8.57. i dun think i'll be able 2 in e near future, busted my knee pretty badly pushing w/o my guards. ltr francis spoke 2 ask, saying he was quite disappointed tt no one ran in e rain that morn. no one outstandin enuff. it got me thinkin...    &nbsp;  j2 farewell. had quite a gd time, but was trying 2 keep low profile cuz i'm sick of everyone asking me qns like "where's e trashbags?", "where's e tape and raffia?", "do u haf this and that..." etc. but it's not e qns tt bother me most but e state e store was in. i couldn't look in e store now. bags everywhere, bicycle on e floor, balls here and there, tents messed up. it's jus in a complete fucking mess. 2 u, it's like "so? it's jus a store wad. messy nvm one." but 2 me, it's smth i've spent 3 fucking daysof my fucking hols 2 fucking cleanup and fucking arrange. moreover, when i say tt no changing in e store, there is a reason, so tt u wun dump ur clothes arnd or knock things over or mess up e arrangements and stuff. now all e prusiking stuff all messed up, mr lim wld cum 2&nbsp;me and haf me arrange everything again. thanx a lot guys. i've had enuff.    &nbsp;  went home, open e main door, heard my mom scream, went out wif liyun, weixiang, jerome, byron and siowfong, planning 2 watch movie. however due 2 lack of tix and timings, we didn't. so we went ova 2 e youth park there 2 talk. talked abt lots of things, mainly bout odac,&nbsp;but e topic which caught my attention was abt ppl showin "initiative". liyun mentioned abt ppl being unable 2 draw e line btwn initiative and personal gain. often tryin 2 take up leadership roles abt themselves so as 2 be voted exco came across as very fake 2 her. these ppl often do everything themselves and do not gif others chance 2 shine. i admit i might haf been a little selfish, acting like a self-appointed logistics head. i apologise 4 tt. i've had enuff of my 'fun'. take e key frm me, i'll gladly gif it 2 u. jus as long u'll treat e store like ur baby. i'm sick of all e politics and tension in odac. splinter grps are forming and could this mark e end of a happy family? i dunno. but i'm losing e passion in odac, e onli thing now keeping me in sch. if things get any worse, i'll might consider leavin, cuz i sumhow do not feel as connected wif e rest as b4. and i can't bear 2 see odac crumble. hope things will becum betta

       came 2 sch early hoping 2 run a few laps and maybe try 4 2.4. but my knees still hurt so in end jus a long jog. saw byron, jia hao and joel training very hard on e track. starting to feel e pressure on me, esp afta bryan and felix clocked 8.58, 8.59 respectively yesterdae. i feel happy 4 them 2 break e 9 barrier but 2 deny i was jealous wld be a blatant lie. i put in 150% everydae training, and these 2 came along and trashed my timing. i dun hate them or wad, but it seems realli unfair tt i get stuck wif these stupid injuries and e inability 2 get below 8.50+ is very sickening. oh well, guess jus haf 2 train harder. on my way up, jason liu was commenting on how i look like robocop frm far, i mean wif my knee guards on both legs plus my ankle weights, wad's next? elbow and wrist guards and helmet? normally i wld haf laughed it off, but e fact tt one of these daes i might actually be as human as robocop. prothestic limbs and stuff, didn't seem very amusing.      pulled myself out of e night cycling trip yesterdae. quite last minute, so very sry guys if i caused u all a lot of trouble. felt i was a burden 2 e team and due 2 e nature of my injury, which can come anitime, it's not a wise choice, esp since i'm e onli repair man in grp 2. much as i want 2 go, i realise i muz choose wisely cuz e last time cycle in gym, i could hardly straighten my knees afta e whole thing. sry 4 being unreliable, lousy and useless. i wanna go, i can go, but i gave it up. ironic? esp when there r others hu wanna go but parents dun allow. spoke 2 rao a while. he raised an interesting pt concerning steph's inclusion in e trip. i mean why do we need to speak up 4 her 2 go 4 e trip when there wasn't any need 2 4 hengyi? no offense bro, but i mean  both r oso not frm cjc n by right sldn't be able 2 come. was it cuz hy tried so hard 2 stay in cj but forced 2 move 2 nj onli cuz of parents, while steph went ac out of her own free will? does this mean tt she gave up odac, or tt she chose her studies first? or could it e tt hy comes back more frequently and is more outspoken and close 2 us? it seems rather unfair 2 steph, dun u think?       2dae feeling very crabby 4 no reason. pissed off at e slightest issue. sry zy 4 making u angry. sry 4 p.s.ing walter and gang afta movie, need 2 spend sum time alone and reflect on everything gg on currently. many unresolved problems, unanswered qns and overdue work. so little time so much 2 do. wat 2 do? solve it loh! just keep swimming...just keep swimming...

       felt like crap 2dae. morning run supposed 2 run 16laps1.25. rubbish.   breezed thru my 1st at a crazy pace, 1.07. when i ran up 2 mr lim, he screamed at me 2 slow down, saying i was running 5km, not 1.5km. i get a little carried away sumtimes, jus like 2 see e gap btwn me and e rest of at least 1/4 round. suddenly, during e 3rd lap, i felt a sharp pain in my right knee. quite common when i'm running wif timings, so i didn't gif a shit bout it. but on e 5th,  i oso felt e sharp pain in my left. i thot i could run it off. mind over body. wad a load of bullshit. up until e 9th round, i was still able 2 maintain a 30s lead ahead of time. but i stopped at 10. my knees were trembling uncontrollably, i couldn't stand up straight. useless piece of rubbish. during pe, tried 2 pace kaipin 4 2.4km, run 1 lap, pain is back. stupid fool. talked 2 mr lim after sch, and was scolded inside out. i deserved it for being so cocky, thinking i'm so gd when i'm not. needed e scolding 2 bring me back 2 focus.  how 2 join x-country when so unreliable? a bit only wanna gif up. lousy. bloody fool. first lap go so fast in e end oso nvr complete, wad's e use? so weak mentally and injury-prone, still wanna join wad stupid sheares bridge run, army half marathon and standard chartered? even real run oso dun think u can finish w/o stopping...etc.  it cut me deep. it cut me real deep. am i really tt useless? jus a pathetic excuse for a human being? my knees hurt, but tt's besides e pt. i could've haf pushed e last 6 laps. i was still well ahead of time. it's jus at most another 9 min or less. i was thinking abt it as i sat there watching byron they all run. i cried. partly due 2 e pain, but mainly due 2 me feeling so useless, vulnerable, gif others chance 2 fault me, let mr lim down, let myself down, let everyone, who believed in me, cheered for me, down. my knees still hurt badly now, dun noe if i shld go 4 night cyclin. dun wanna jeopardise e team. took a chance last xp, now dun think i shld. see how, if i can make it 1.25 for 16 tml, i wld go. if not, den i'll haf 2 speak 2 mr lim and galvin...

LCF spoke 2 me e other dae, sae if i haf e discipline 2 cum @ 7 2 run everydae, why cannot put in more effort in studies? why can't connect-and-transfer? if i dun improve might haf 2 talk 2 mr lim abt making me less involved and shit. u noe wad? i dun gif a fuck! so e most retain, den got one more yr in odac, one more yr 2 work on running. worse cum 2 worst go poly nxt yr loh. like i gif a shit! but i'm growing weary. i wake up every morning more tired than e nite b4. dunno how long i can last b4 breaking down but will try 2 push as long as possible.      juz wanna sae smth 2 sum of e ppl i missed out e last time:   rao: recently see u like v stressed. relac a bit. it might do u sum gd. got any prob or anything juz cum talk 2 me, i'll alwaes be here.   binh: rest ur legs and see a doc lah u stupid fool. i think u might get stress fractures or smth if u keep this up.   max: sry if i dun haf much chances recently 2 talk 2 u. will try 2 do so once i'm free k?   wawa: really sry abt e carnival tt time. gave u so much trouble. will gif u a treat next time.   2 all those who r applicable(in bgr): i've seen how destructive it is 2 both parties(cannot study properly, running like shit etc.). i hope u all wld realise in time. dun let e problems affect u all 2 much. ur life muz go on, and dun ostracise e rest of e gang.

       useless shit. had quite a bad dae. where shld i start? at e end or beginning? e latter wld be a more sane option. woke up this morning, my fever was gone, but still got bodyache and e sick head-very-heavy-and-no-balance feeling. met up wif prashan on e track and he invited me 2 run wif e x-country team. was flattered at first but when i started running wif him and cheng jul, i realised there is still a huge gap btwn us. their stride is very tiring to match, and i cld onli go 3 rounds or so b4 my knees hurt again. decided 2 stop cuz ltr got intensive trg. jus watching cheng jul sprinting down e track is inspirational and i'm w/o a doubt how he became cap.      pissed off during pw again, but dun wanna go there now. it'll onli make my blood boil. trg was as usual, more talk den action, but it's alwaes interesting. even though sumtimes i feel we shld haf more activities like games and stuff. den we had a 15 round level-1. led e pack until e 13th lap when felix overtook. was actually feeling quite gd, cruising along, not really exerting tt much efort 4 e first 9+rounds. den on e 10th round, i think i turned wrongly at e bend and i heard a loud pop in my right knee. e pain was fucking intense. it shot straight up 2 my brain and it burned like hell. after tt, my pace slowed. on e 12th my left knee oso started complaining, guess i put 2 much pressure on it once my right went out of commission. by e 14th, i was practically dragging my legs forward. when i saw felix run past me, i was alreadi pushing my limit, but my legs was outta mi control. i cld onli watch him get a 21sec lead over me. how ironic, my fav no. came in 21.26.11sec over levl-1 target.bs. i alwaes said 2 others,"mind over body". mind over body? go eat fuck. e mind is willing but e flesh is weak. tried 2 run wif e guys again 4 interval but cldn't even complete 2 rounds. rubbish.      when i was resting there, sprawled out in e feel wif yy massaging my knees when i heard sum1 make a comment when he saw me lying there. "all tt talk all 4 show, no real substance." i wld haf gotten up and knocked e daylights outta him if i didn't feel e same way. i admit, sumtimes i tend 2 b a bit outspoken maybe obnoxious and cocky 2 sum, whole dae talking bout competitions and stuff when my own fitness is in tatters. am i realli gonna run e army half marathon? am i really gonna run e full standard chartered marathon? am i realli gonna aim 4 a medal 4 real run? how can i win anithing when i cldn't even do lvl-1? lvl 2 oso might not haf any chance 2 win. am i aiming 2 high? esp 4 sum1 who crawls outta bed every morning, crying as i take painkillers, weighing my options; whether addiction is worth a chance 2 stand again? sum1 whose legs can barely support his own body weight?      jus wanna sae a few words 2 sum ppl:   star player: injured ankle, sprained wrists etc and still trg? crazy shit! jus know when 2 rest. dun need 2 listen 2 me but jus rmb, u dun wanna end up in my state.   li yun: another crazy one, injured still push like siao, eg 2dae's trg? but at least more sensible den mr star. rite?   julia: 2dae whack until like crazy den went 2 puke or smth rite? but very impressed 2 see u running everydae. keep up e gd work, a captain needs respect, and u haf gained mine together wif many others.   joanne and zhiying: saw u struggling in pain e last few trgs. shld stop and rest if u feel pain. can alwaes make up other time. pain is ur body's way of telling u smth is wrong, so dun ignore.   henyi: my gd fren, u oso another one injured. but at least u noe how 2 rest. but i want u think more abt wad i told u e other time, k?   galvin and hui xin: i'll stop trg, i promised liao. after real run. i noe u r concerned and i appreciate tt, realli. but this run is very impt 2 me, i'm almost done.   prashan: i'm not worthy 2 be called e future of cj x-country. sry.   sl: i promised u a medal this sundae. i will try my best.
