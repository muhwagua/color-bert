       urlLink     wool   urlLink      It was a quiet weekend here in the hollow. I spent a lot of time cleaning up around the farm. Lots of things I no longer need or are broken beyond repair that need to be given away, recycled, or thrown out. Also much time spent on the phone finding out more about Camp Wood, TX! It's sounding better, and better...      I need to do something with my HUGE amount of raw wool. I don't want to spin it all, but may try my hand at felting for a fun change. There is a woman who frequents the coffee house in the village, and makes felted wool bags. They are really nice! So I may give this a try. She felts large pieces of natural colors or naturally dyed wool together, and then sews them into bags. They are really lovely.      So I have been dreaming of doing this for another winter pastime, and also stocking my winter library for those long snowy nights by the woodstove and fire. Mainly titles I've chosen are women's wilderness stories, kayaking, and finish off some of my Foxfire volumes. I'm almost hoping for snow now!

       urlLink     my sunflowers   urlLink      What a busy day! Oh it was lovely though, and I got loads done. After a ton of laundry, going to the post office to mail some things, I needed to take a drive into Burlington to the natural food store as I was (GASP!) out of Teechino. For those of you that don't know what Teechino is, it's an herbal coffee substitute. I'm a Vegitan (Vegan) and eat no animal products. The last thing I gave up was coffe (OUCH!) It was very difficult as I love my coffee, but now I have it on holidays as a treat and I feel and sleep much better. So I was out of Teechino, and a few other items, hence my hike to the store. So I'm wandering around browsing...I love to look at all the girl stuff like natural makeups, oils, perfumes. I like to smell things, like the soaps, massage oils, ya know...girl stuff. Anyhoo, they have a yummy book section which I flew over to like a magnet! And what did my wandering eyes should appear??? This title: " Woman Who Glows in the Dark, A Curandera RevealsTraditional Aztec Secrets of Physical &amp; Spiritual Health " which immediately caught my eye...and then on the back cover, a nifty little plug on the back cover by Clarissa Pinkola Estes (author of  Women Who Run WIth the Wolves ). My inner bell rang loudly. Ok, I was sold! In the cart it went with my other treasures like Thai Kitchen's Lemongrass Salad Splash and Burt's Bees Lavender Mint Tooth paste. I love that stuff. I mix it with a little Tom's of Maine's Spearmint since the Lavendar Mint isn't foamy and I brush away!       So off I went and checked out. Wes, my son was at a friend's house, so I bought him some goodies too. Traffic was fine getting back, and here I am. Being a farm girl, one doesn't travel much, so I splurge on a massage every couple of weeks, and I buy books and natural goodies to make me feel good and look/smell not so much like a farmer.       It's raining. I fed tonight dodging lightening. I need to go wash some greens and vegetables for dinner. And then...READ!!! Yahooooooo!

       urlLink     greenhouse   urlLink      Not much to share today. I cleaned up. It's good to take a photo QUICK! before it gets messy again. LOL!      I have a ton to do today, but mostly errands to the feedstore, post office, natural food store which is a ways away. It's a beautiful day, and the windows are all open so the sounds of farm creatures and wild birds come in on the breeze.      Maybe I'll get enough done to play on the lake tomorrow in one gorgeous red kayak!

       urlLink     harvest   urlLink      The greenhouse is so nice to work in since I cleaned it up that I've spent all morning out there preparing flats for fall planting. I have so many veggies! This has been an excellent year with all the rain. The only thing I wish I had planted earlier are berry bushes. I think I'll order some blueberries, rasberries, and gooseberries after I figure out where I want them. I'll add a little as time goes on if I stay here. I'm still up in the air about Texas. I'm very tempted, but it's hard after you've worked so hard in one place to have to start afresh. *sigh* So, I'll continue thinking.      My greenhouse cherry tomatoes are a excellent this year, especially the sunsugar yellows.  Carrots are filling out nicely. Lots of cabbage moths in the kale, so it’s time to scout for caterpillars and spray. I'll plant more sage there next to the kale in the spring. I'll try some garlic spray first and if it's unsuccessful, I'll use Bt.    I put up 52 jars of tomato sauce and stewed tomatoes yesterday. Suprisingly it didn't take long with my son helping.Oh it feels good to look at stored food. It must be my stellium in Taurus as that secure feeling of looking at a well stocked pantry is priceless!

       urlLink     texas   urlLink      It's so funny I just mentioned my grandmother, and have been thinking of Texas all week. A friend of mine emailed from Camp Wood, TX, from a 3300 acre ranch that "I would just love" and offered me employment. WOW. I have no idea what kind of employment. What a move that would be. I admit, I've been on unitedcountry.com looking at land all week all over Texas. Nice properties, but the houses were trash. Either mobile homes, doublewides, or modulars. I could always tear it down and rebuild later. It's a nice thought to be able to live on your property while building. I'm thinking in that heat, straw bale would be good combined with cedar and cob. Man, I have a great imagination. So I'll see what that offer is about, and think it over.    I ogle my Texas Highways monthly and watch Texas Country Reporter on friend's televisions who have satellite every so often. I was just about to order my Texas Highways calendar too from  urlLink www.texashighways.com  , and here is this offer from the Universe to go home. Hmmm...       We went kayaking yesterday. My paddling friend Arluna (not her real name), and I went kayaking around to hunt for left over blueberries, and we found a few! We paddled all over the edge of a local 300 acres lake. It was so relaxing and much needed. The blueberries we found were so sweet, and we waded around in the shallow shore areas discussing books, men, life, and spiritual things. Thought we saw a bear, but I think it was deer. Bear are so black and esy to spot. Too bad, I love to bear watch.       It was a glorious perfect day. I needed that!

       urlLink     luna   urlLink      I just finished " The Legacy of Luna " by Julia Buttefly Hill and it was GREAT! She's my newest hero. Move over Tasha Tudor, and make a little room for Julia! This is a woman who spent 2 years living on a 8'x6' platform in a California redwood named "Luna" to save her from clearcutting. Talk about a loooooong tree sit. Hail to you Julia Butterfly for your courage, stubborness, and refusal to accept things as they are. What a free spirit to be admired. The DVD "   Butterfly", a documentary on Julia's tree sit is available for rent from Netflix  urlLink www.netflix.com  and it was wonderful.      Staying in a redwood 180' off the ground isn't as romantic as it sounds. Sometimes it was heavenly and so beautiful. Other times it was terrifying with high winds and her platform being tossed 3' in the air while suffering frostbite, and being cold like I can't imagine.       Stories like Julia's give me hope. Hope and the proof that anything is possible if we put our minds to it. Julia kicked some serious loggong company ass, and I love her for it.

       urlLink     hens   urlLink      I noticed this morning, while in the hen house that Prunella, a gorgeous silver laced wyandotte had a messy butt, so I have added food grade hydrogen peroxide to the waterer. We'll see how this works. I hope it's just a  passing  thing...nyuk!..nyuk!...excuse the pun.       It's still raining this morning, but the garden is loving it. I've been so spoiled with this cool summer. It makes it a lot easier to work outside without the swealtering sun and humidity...add a few bugs and you're miserable. This summer has been a dream though, and I've gotten so much done.       I got a wild hair last night, and cleaned up the main green house. I had gotten some bags of pebbles to line the walk areas with, and so after I stacked pots, cleaned out dead plant matter and swept up, I put my pebbles down. It looks so nice! Moss grows like crazy in there, and I don't mind except the floor can get very slippery. So now it's a problem solved. I have four other movable greenhouses on frames that I rotate each season. This works beautifully for us and we have fresh greens and vegetables all four seasons.       The main green house is off of my kitchen. I have three solar panels to heat with and they work beautifully so far. We installed them before last winter (Autumn 2003), and they worked beautifully last winter, even the house felt warmer. I got my panels used, and added a fan from Crystal Bay  urlLink www.crystalbay.net  and I'm amazed at how well these 3 panels heat so efficiently. Now my african grey and Lady Gouldians can stay out in the greenhouse longer and they love it.      Today I'll be canning more jams, tomatoes, and maybe make more pickles.   I'm almost out of jars. :(

       urlLink     grandma   urlLink      I was missing my grandma today. I was raised by my grandparents in a tiny town in Texas. In the 50's and 60's the area was like Mayberry RFD, and then in the 70's they built DFW airport and the place is now a zoo. How odd not to be able to even recognize areas when I go back home. Whole areas of land changed and developed. How sad. I have so many fond memories of growing up there. My grandmother, who passed on New Years Day 2001, was a huge influence in my life. She was big into vitamins, herbs and reflexology before it became "in". I miss her more than words can say.      My grandmorher was raised in Nebraska, on a small farm. Her childhood was no delight with a mother who was a bit crazy and mean, and so she and her sister spent a lot of time in the barn. Her father was a kind man, and I remember him. He lived with us for a short time when I was very small. He had a kind heart and was a very genuine person. Do people like that exist anymore? I'm not sure. I had no children to play with on the Texas prairie so I played with wildlife and the horses, dogs, and cats we had on the farm. It was a rich time in my life and a beautiful way to spend childhood. A large toad sat on the front porch nightly, and looked like she was related to Jaba the Hut. My grandmother named her "Hidegard Hamhocker". Hildegard spent many a summer on the porch and got fairly tame. Thank goodness for memories. My love of toads still exists today, and I think I've passed it on to me son.          I come in the little things,   Saith the Lord:   Yea! on the glancing wings   Of eager birds, the softly pattering feet   Of furred and gentle beasts, I come to meet   Your hard and wayward heart. In brown bright eyes   That peep from out the brake, I stand confest.   On every nest   Where feathery Patience is content to brood   And leaves her pleasure for the high emprize   Of motherhood—   There doth My Godhead rest.

       urlLink     kayak dreams   urlLink      I forgot to mention that as I was weeding, I would, on occassion, look over longingly at my kayak. It looked oh-so-lonely there parked on the side of the yard. I had it car topped, but took it down to go to a local country fair and didn't want to leave it up there all day in the sun and in case someone got a wild hair to take it.       It's an Old Town Loon 138. I really love paddling. I have 3 friends that I usually paddle with, but the rain has been constant this last week, and there is so much to do around here.      Speaking of watery things, have a look at www.herondance.org Heron Dance if you like nature, watercolor, and poetry. It's a work of love...      Tuesday, rain or shine, I'm paddling around the lake to pick blueberries if there are any left. Maybe make some jam!

       urlLink     herstory   urlLink        Ahhh...what a day to start a blog. We have gotten so much rain. It's a good thing to be on the side of a mountain as we aren't flooded. The weeds have all gone crazy though, and I spent most of the day weeding the raised beds and my herb garden. I listened to VPR and the classical was nice while gardening. I love the coolness, and am getting ready for more with thoughts of fall. The blazing colors, apple cider, frisky animals.  A native Texan, I have a 12 acre organic farm in Vermont. I am owned by 3 horses, cashmere goats, sheep, chickens, four dogs, 2 cats, 1 ten year old wonderful male human, and A LOT of wildlife. We have a quiet life here in this mountain hollow. It's just my son and I here, and I'm amazed some days at how far we've come. For a year I lived in an Urban enviroment after marrying an abusive man, who had been wonderful to me for 2 years before. After I signed that license and took my vows, that would all change to an embarrassing horror.  It's since been 11 years since all that occured, and here we are. A peaceful farm.  I nibbled most of the day on these incredible breakfast cookies. I'm a Vegitan person (or Vegan to some). That means I don't eat meat or dairy. I do use honey though, and I am not much of an activist. I tend not to judge others and feel I'm responsible for only myself. Oh how I hate a controling person. So I hope to set an example by action, not promotion. I'm also very healthy! Anyway, here are those cookies:  Wisteria's Breakfast Cookies  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Step 1 - beat together until well mixed: 2 T. water2 tsp. EnerG Egg Replacer Step 2 - add the following and mix well: 2 and 1/2 c. oats 1/2 tsp. of baking soda and baking powder 1 tsp. cinnamon 3/4 c. smooth, thick unsweetened applesauce 2 Tsp of maple syrup 1 tsp. vanilla 1/2 to 1 cup of fresh fruit. I use blueberries, blackeries, rasberries or figs.)  I then use a big spoon to "drop" them onto a lightly greased cookie sheet in the shape of cookies. Bake for 10-15 minutes.  They do not stick together like regular cookies, but good enough. It is more or less like eating chewy granola. But it is filling enough for me. I usually make them on Sundays so I have something easy to grab in the morning and goats like them too!
