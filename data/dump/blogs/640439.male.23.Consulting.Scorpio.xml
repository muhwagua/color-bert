      It's now been a week since I left my home of Houston, Texas.  The trip here while long(even longer without cruise control...it did work one and a half times for me) was a good time.  Adam and I think we crossed the largest bridge in every state, at least we are saying we did.  We left my house around 8ish Sunday night and made it to Lake Charles to spend a night with a friend.  On the way we saw Mr. Big, the scariest gas station in Houston, and Fast and the Furious (3 Civics out of no where passed us).    The following day was Memorial day and we traveled to Penescecola Beach.  It was gay pride week so that was a site to see.  Not much eye candy for us guys.  I was fortunate to meet my great Unlce Norm and Aunt Barbara.  Also a second and third cousin.  That night at the boardwalk my third cousin made me buy a drink called the Bushwacker, its like a Wendy's Frosty but with alcohol...very good.  May 28th we spent some time on the beach and headed for our next stop of North Carolina.  We drove quite a bit from 1pm till 2 in the morning. Random fact, you know how the Dairy Queen is a Texas stop sign.  Well the south stop sign is the Waffle House, every town had one it seems.  In Georgia or Alabama we saw a guy with a license plate that said NO FUN, he must be a winner.  Driving through North Carolina we were pretty dilerious.  Crossing into the state we decided it was time for North Carolina to raise up and take our shirts off.  We were getting pretty close to our destination but needed to sleep.  My marketing prof once said that you can negoiate prices at hotels late at night so they don't lose money on an empty room, well thats a bunch of  bull shit.  We tried and all of them said no.  We even went to a Scottish Inn, and there was not a Scottish person working.  A dissappointment to say the least.  We finally ended up at a Days Inn.  There was still alcohol, lemons, limes and olives, and for some reason a tube of toothpaste by on the night stand in the room with a big king size bed.  It only takes a little imagination to imagine what happened the night before.  I'm just hoping they washed the sheets.  So now its the 29th and we went to go check out Univesity of North Carolina and Duke.  The campuses are amazing and put A&M's to shame.  Hey here's a challenge go to CiCi's pizza and try to leave without them noticing.  It won't happen, so you hear a lot of the co workers yell thanks for coming or something along those lines.  After seeing the campuses we drove up to a suburb of Philly called King of Prussia where Adam has a second cousin.  On the way we drove through DC, so that was kind of exciting to see some of the monuments from the road.  So it's the 30th now and we take a train into Philly.  The city is pretty much ghetto, but we decided to make it somewhat educational and check out Independance Hall and the Liberty Bell.  Plus we got Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches.  They were allright.  Next stop New York.  Carson Daly the host of MTV's TRL has a radio show on the afternoons we were fortunate to come across.  Once again it was a quick conclusion to realize that he is a tool.  Another question, why the hell does it cost 6 bucks to cross a bridge?    Adam and I made it to our new home of Dobbs Ferry, and more importantly Mercy college where we will be staying.  The town is pretty small, basically has two main streets and they aren't that main.  The houses on the hill are awesome and the car of choice seems to be either a Mercedes or BMW.  Since we arrived to Dobbs a day earlier we were unsure where we going to spend the night.  The two hotels we found were too expensive for what they looked like.  We were gonna spend the night in the car when I decided to see if anyone was in the dorm that could allow us in.  Luckily Clarence the security guy was nice enough to let us.  In an hour he was able to location a RA who let us in.  Everyone here is pretty nice, unlike the campus.  However we are next to the Hudson river which is big.....and digustingly brown.  The rooms here at Mercy are small, have no AC, community showers, etc...but they are cheaper than anything I could find in the city so that's a plus.  Baseball is a big thing in this town, Im talkin about minors though.  Every morning I wake up to parents cheering or Christian music played over some kind of PA system.  On the 31st, we got our rooms  moved in and settled, we then did a Wal mart run, except they don't have Wal-Marts, which was a surprise.  They did have a Kmart in a town nearby.  There are like 5 towns here and you never really know when you are leaving one and going to another.  All you realize is that you are stuck in traffic forever.    Yesterday was the first time we ventured into the city.  I plotted out my route to work and its really close to Grand Central station which works out nice.  I then tried to setup banking, need to be a NY resident or something.  We then walked all around Midtown.  Saw Times Square (they have those people painted in silver and do the robot thing), Rockafeller, Radio City, Chrsyler Building, up and down 5th Ave and Park Ave.  We made it to Central Park.  There are some good street performers.  We saw a group of dancers and they were just crazy, one guy ran up a wall and did a flip. Which dancer was the worst, not surprisingly the only white guy in the group.  He still would put me to shame, but thats nothing new.  Thats pretty much the first week in a nutshell, my job starts tomorrow followed by 11 weeks of it.

      I wish I had more time to access this journal.  So many times something comes up that I wish I would be able to write down(I realize there are always pads and pens).  Not much new has really happened though.  I find it surprising that the car of choice of where we now live is Lincoln Town Cars.  There are just a ton of them, and I find it fun to imagine it's mafia or something else.    I went to what is the closet thing to a grocery store here.  It's called Ctown.  The C most likely stands for convenience, I'm going to say it stands for crap.  I'm looking forward to the HEBs and Albertsons.  What is even worse about this place is that is 5, 10 minute from where we live.  You can only carry so many plastic bags so far.  I finally got around to do some laundry.  Its expensive up here.  I also met a weird guy in the elevator, but I've since learned he has mental problems and lives with his mother.    Well I think I found an un tapped market, maybe it has been but I wasn't able to find it.  I was buying Ellen a birthday card and went to the Hallmark store.  They have bday cards for moms, dads, husbands, wifes, sisters, brothers, etc. but not anywhere did I see one that said girl or boyfriend.    Adam and I made it to a Happy Hour last night, we were going to get dinner there too, but it was too expensive.  We ended up going to Cafe Metro.  We've been there before, and I really enjoy the place.  It's pretty cheap and good.  iOpening a hotdog stand by Northgate or putting in a nice little cafe I feel would be a great chance to earn money in ol CS.  I just lack the capital and more importantly the initiative to follow up on the idea.  Afterwards we headed back home and we finally had the A/C installed in the window.  I must say it helps so much.  I actually had to sleep under some covers.  Something that I haven't done in weeks.  Need to get back to work.

      So here it is 6:30 and I am still at the office.  which for lots, I'm sure isn't too late, but for me it is.  I think there are only 3 people left on the floor, none of them being my supervisors.  I just got done re doing some publication information.  After I had created work sheets and done all this data entry, he forgot to tell me not to include Nov and Dec. publications.  So instead of waiting till tomorrow, for production needs to start ASAP, I decided what the hell and stay late.  So at some point this week I should be out a hour earlier which isn't too bad of a set up.    Not much else, checked out another play in Bryant park last night.  The weather is definitely getting warmer.  Oh today was a good day to see just how secure I am.  We are trying to find advertisements for a mustard and a salad dressing for our client liked the ideas they used and thought maybe down the line we could incorpoate such things.  I was then sent down to buy women's magazines where these articles would be found.  Instead of using EPBs money, I told them i would just flip through them there and buy any that had the ads.  So here I am, a 21 year old male college student flipping through Bon Appetite, Better Home and Gardens, Family Circle, Women's Day or something along those lines in Grand Central.  However mission was accomplished and at least I didn't look dirty like the old business men buying porn.  Well I'm out of here, I need to do some grocery shopping and do some laundry.

      It seems to be that it might become more of a challenge for me to access my journal for my computer will be unplugged till school starts, however I will still try and write to it from work when the occasion arises.  Reason being is that Adam and I have now moved to what is pretty much in the Bronx.  To give you an idea of location, we are close to 215th street.  Grand Central and Time Square is at 42nd street.  So about a 170 blocks away from midtown.  We are on the first floor of an apartment building next to a park.  A co worker of mine has a friend who is going to S. America for business and pleasure and was looking for someone to sublease.  Unable to do so, we were offered the place rent free (do have to pay for utilities) as long as we take care of her two cats.  The place isn't the greatest, but it's not bad either.  There is an A/C in the bedroom and cable TV which is a plus.  I'd have to say the worst thing though is the cat hair.  We have made the bedroom cat free and make sure the door is always closed.  Still, I'm sure it will end up on everything.    However saving a 1000 dollars seems to outweigh the cost.  Saturday was the day we left, we ate dinner at the same place we ate when we had arrived.  Good ol Doubledays, its pretty good.  Sunday after sleeping in, I went to the city looking for a birthday gift for Elle.  I didn't have that much luck, plus I really don't care to shop.  That was pretty much the extent of the day.  While even though we are now closer to the city, it still takes about the same time to get to work.  I now ride the subway, and have to only switch once.  A train to the 7.  Let me tell you what, it gets hot in those subways.  Luckily the cars themselves are air conditioned.  Alright well I need to go FedEx some advertisements that promote cancer and mouth disease.  My favorite part of the day.

      Well Adam is now 21.  After work we met up and went to a Mexican or Tex Mex restaraunt.  Surprisingly it was pretty good, I enjoyed it.  I take it they didn't have happy hour for beers were 5 bucks, and that didn't make it me happy, so I only bought one.  Work seemed pretty hectic yesterday.  One thing that I am looking forward is to help on the account ESGR.  We work in coordination with the Ad Council so all the work we do is volunteer.  It is a government organization that is to help employers understand their responsibilities about their employees who might have to be gone for awhile during a time of crisis.  Basically they have to let workers go to training or to war if the time arises and still have a job of equal pay there when they come back.  Not much is done on it, but I hope to learn and work more on the account.  Well today there is a chance I'm suppose to meet up with a lady from Queens to take care of her cats.  What does this mean, a place for Adam and I to live rent free, closer to the city, and have some A/C.  We just pay utilities, and I save myself a little over a $1000.  So I'm really hoping it works out.

      Yesterday Adam and I headed to the park to go check out the concerts.  The concert was sold out, but there was still a ton of people outside listening.  You could hear it just fine, just couldn't see them.  One thing I found funny was I got two hotdogs which was like 2.50 and payed with a 20.  He was like I need something smaller, and I said I'm sure you have change.  Sure enough he did, and he had lots he was just being lazy.  I had to wait in a line, and I'm sure he's done good business all day.    I've started to see lighting bugs which is fun, haven't seen them since I was kid.  Yesterday in the park we saw three racoons, I'd always thought they'd be quick tree climbers, but they're not.  Nothing else is to new here at the office.  I've started to help them with ESGR.  It's a service, it stands for something like Employers Serving Guards and Reserve.  Basically we work with the ad council to help communicate the message that by law employers have to accept the fact if a worker goes to work that he has to have the same sort of job when he gets back.  I wish there was more work on this account, but since it is a free service we provide (as well as numerous agencies on different subjects) not too much work is done.  It's lunch time

      Not much has happened so far this week.  Just doing the same ol 9-5.  Monday night I met up with Adam and we went to Bryant Park.  They have old classic movies there every Monday night in the summer.  It was fun just to sit down and watch an ol Sinatra flick.  Surprisingly it was actually entertaining.  The park was packed, and didn't even clear out all that much when it started to rain.  Luckily it didn't last long.  Being the southern gentleman that I am, I shared my umbrella with some other lady.    Yesterday at work I had to help with a lot of invoicing, which really is not all that fun.  After work I changed clothes and just wandered around the city taking it in.  Tonight I'm going to meet up with Adam and head off to Central Park.  Two of my favorite bands Dispatch and Jack Johnson are to perform at Summer stage.  Instead of paying the 25 bucks to get in, I figure since it's an outdoor concert we should be able to get close enough just hear it.

      Well I am sure that I will have forgotten something, but a lot happened this weekend.  Thursday, don't remember really what happened so it must not of been anything big.  Friday I got to work.  Its nice getting out early and dressing down.  Afterwards I was to go to Grand Central station to meet up with an ol highschool friend.  I had some time so I just sat down along the side and watched the people.  I decided to grab a spot along the wall and wait around.  While the wall was long and empty, some guy decided to sit next to me.  I was like this should be interesting.  He talked to me for a little bit and then kind of did his own thing.  I was surprised later when an old lady came up to me and asked me for a knife.  I was taken back, but then she told me she needed to open something.   So anyways I meet up Brian and Adam (who had just ran into someone he knew who we joined).  We decided to go to some Broadway play and waited in that long line for cheaper tickets.  We didn't know you had to pay with cash so when I got up there I was like looks like I won't be seeing a play.  Everything good was sold out anyways.  We then left for Chinatown and little Italy.  It would of been better without the rain, but we still found a cool lil Italian restaraunt and chatted a bit.  Afterwards we went up and walked around Time Square and decided to go see a movie.  Walking through Times Square we saw something being filmed.  I guess the Dutchess of York, Fergi has a new show.  We also went to the ESPN sports bar.  I couldn't even afford to think about having a drink.  A beer is like $7, but hey LL Cool J was somewhere in the building we were told.  Later on we saw Bourne Identity, it was alright, but movies are 10 bucks, but the theater was huge and nice.  Here's someting I don't get.  I was trying to figure out which way to Grand Central station to get home.  I asked a worker, and he told us.  He gave us wrong directions, it's something I think you would know where it is living in the city.  We took the last train home.  The next day we slept in and then went into the city.  We went to the Natural History museum and only saw a bit of it.  There are quite a few exhibits. We then checked out a planetarium show in their new space exhibit which is nice.  Afterwards we then walked through Central Park. Hearin some familiar music we decided to go check it out.  It was singer called Vitamin C, whose pretty much a two hit wonder.  She's not great, but it was just funny to just come across.  We then did the whole 5th ave walk and Rockafella center.  One thing I enjoyed was sitting down and seeing this 50 or 60 year old couple dancing there.  No music was being played, except the song they both seemed to be hearing.  It's great to see people let go and just do what they want.  We then caught a subyway to Greenwich for some dinner.  We ate outside at a cool little pub called Bernie Macs.  I love this part of the city.  Sittin down outside and looking around, if you would have asked me in highschool what I would be doing some summer in college I would have never guessed that I'd be here taking in NYC.  The food was great and so was the weather.  After the long dinner we just walked around and checked out some stores. Walking around though I noticed more guys gave me the second look than the ladies.  Something else I found funny is that they have stores that sell bongs.  True the display cases say for tobacco use only, but you know thats not what they used for.   Heading to Washington park we came across these chess tables.  There wasn't too many people there, but the whole purpose was to show Brian the arch.  Well I decided I might try and play a bit so I gave this guy a game (he talked me into it).  Told him all I had was $2, he said that would work.  He beat me in like 20 moves.  I was like well I'll want a rematch sometime. He's like I'm here everyday, I sleep on this bench.  I told him he's on, and I'll come back.  I think I would have given the guy more of a challenge if it wasn't for the clock you have to use everytime you make a play.  You get 10 minutes per game unless you pay more.  So I wanted to try and make as many plays as possible.   Enough execuses....so were at this park and we get offered weed again.  This must be the place to buy, too bad it's not my thing.  We also got offered shrooms, by some other guy.  Crazy Yankers.    We then headed back to Times Square, and did some more walking and just chatted a bit more.  Again took the last possible train home.  However this time it was more interesting.  Some kid, who looked 16-19.  Asked if he could sit next to us, with plenty of seats still available. He looked interesting and I said go for it. He then talked the whole 45 minute ride back about in his words how fucked up society is.  He doesn't believe in working with the wage system that is in place.  He said he wasn't lazy, but just didn't want to work.  Entertaining enough.    This moring slept in once again and then got Brian back in the city.  He needed to catch a bus to the airport.  Finally I had a black and white cookie.  You see them in every deli, bakery and I decided there must be something good about them. Not really, they are overrated.  I have found ants again in my room.  It seems Brian left some food in here.  However I found out I am not the only one with an ant problem, a girl two rooms down does too.  That brings us to now.

      Today was an alright day at work.  For the most part I was busy, but I also had to do stuff that I thought I shouldn't have.  Take for example...a person on the client side had major surgery.  So they told me to order flowers.  I was like do you want me to write anything.  They said yeah, but didn't tell me what.  I could have done something funny instead of along the get well lines, but I guess my morals are too high.  I also had to check advertisements for errors that were being sent to magazines.  I know some of the stuff to look for, but not everything.  My boss said they should be good and told me just to go over them and then Fed Ex them.  Hopefully they are good.  The weather is starting to get a lil hot and humid.  So the no A/C in the dorms really is starting to suck.  Here's another thing thats not good.  On the way home from Grand Central I've been falling asleep on the train.  Yesterday I luckily woke up at the stop before and today I would have probably gone right through had it not been for a worker who was going around checking tickets to make sure I had payed.  So now Im going to make an effort not to fall asleep.

      Well not much has really happened the last two days.  I've worked on my four projects.  Done with one, another one just needs to be reviewed, the room one has to wait till they have clearance to buy stuff, but for the most part its done as well, and the final one regarding Swedish women and their use of the snuff has come to a stand still and might not be pursued any further until I'm given notice.    It's really been sort of a boring week so far.  My coworkers are entertaining though.  I wish I had some good stories, but really nothing exciting has happened.  I had a bum lady yell Spanish at me for I was like one of the only people that didn't put change in her cup at a crosswalk.  I then replied with a "how about you leave me alone" and a glare, she then muttered something back to me....in Spanish of course.    My batteries went out on the discman today on the subway, so I ended up having to her about these bacherlotte parties the ladies next to me have attended recently.  They also talked about how many business cards they had collected at clubs.  Now this was surprising because they were really not good looking as mean as that might sound.  Oh here's a random thought of the day I thought about in a subway station.  Who invented the bench/chair?  A lazy person or a productive person.  A lazy person is someone who would want to sit down and just relax.  But if he's lazy, would he really then try to construct something.  Something to ponder.  Not really, it's a pretty stupid thought.

      Today was relaxing day.  I wanted to do some laundry but it costs 2.25 a load and thats hard to do when all you have is some random change.  I worked out a bit and then shot some hoops.  I have no atheletic ability.  The weather here was just too nice not to be outside.  Not else was new, talked to some of the people I first met when we got here.    I also did a lil grocery shopping and did an intersting calculation.  I saw the same bottles of water for sale that you buy in the city.  In the city 16 ounces for 1.50.  Now at the grocery store I could buy a pack of 24 for 6 bucks.  So lets say if a vendor buys his from a grocery store (he probably gets them wholesale, which would make them cheaper)  But for the calculation sake.  If he buys them for $6, he makes $30 profit per case.  Im sure he can get rid of a case per hour.  So 30 bucks an hour, plus whatever else he sells.  Doing the math, he makes hella a lot more than I do, just a little random thought.   I decided I needed to grocery shopping for eating out for lunch and several dinners was adding up.  However the food in the city is just so good, convient, and Im lazy and hate cooking.  I see a lot of PB&Js and cereal in the future.  While I wasa in the checkout aisle some lady made a comment on my shirt.  We talked like a minute or so and then she went off on this tangent saying I don't why Im talking to you.  I guess its because of the bad day I've been having.  Pretty psycho.  Well tomorrow is week two for the internship

      Saturday in NYC was just an awesome time.  We left around 11:30 ish and got in around 10:30 tonight.  We walked again so much.  We got into Grand Central and took the subway to Greenich Village.  It was funny cause I could not get the vending machine to work at all.  I'm an idiot.     So we got into Greenich walked up Bleeker street and some others.  We got into some streets of the Chelsea neighborhoods.  On our way back to Greenich we went past this corner and noticed a ton of cameras and studio chairs sort of thing.  Sure enough they were filming a music video.  Angie Martinez was the lady.  She was rapping, but the song sounded like she was a chipmunk or something.  I have no clue who she was but talkin to a girl in the dorms she got all excited (must be an east coast thing).  So if the video ever gets big and makes TRL, I can say I was there.  We walked some more through Greenich and then went to Washington park which I just went to the other day.  They have guys that set up chess boards and you can play them.  Not today, but sometime this summer it's going to be on.    So Adam and I take a break eat our lunch and are sitting on the bench.  Where do you get marijuana?  I guess sitting on a bench in Washington Park.  Within 20 minutes we were asked by three different people.  The first time the guy was like you smoke...thinking he wanted to bum a cigarette, but he had one lit in his hand.  He then walked away and came back and tried to sell some to the people next to us.  He asked us again, and was like so you tellin me you aint like that, getting high.  I was just smiling and was like nope.  We also saw this guy who was just blatant to ladies.  Saying whatever crossed his mind.  Then I don't know why, but for me this was one of the funniest things.  An old couple, who I don't think could walk any slower.  It was like watching someone in slow motion.  I know sounds horrible, but if you were there you'd understand.  Also at this park was some big festival.  Hashmir Krishma.  Those crazy white boys you see with shaved heads.  They were goin dancing, singing and all. Singing about the Dalai Lama and stuff along those lines and why we as humans shouldn't eat meat, etc.  The place was just packed, booths and tents galore.    We then decided to go down into SoHo.  Damn its a lil trendy place.   Greenwich and SoHo, I could definitley see myself living at.  After that we saw a lil Canal street (Chinatown) and Little Italy.  We got on a train and headed down to Wall Street.  We first stopped and saw the Brooklyn Bridge.  Then checked out NY stock exchnage and ground zero.  It was the most quiet place I've seen in the city.  But that was due to the fact that it's the weekend and no one was at work.  We then walked down to Battery Park, walked around that for awhile.  Saw the Statue of Liberty and decided to start heading back.  Ate some pizza on the way to Grand Central and then got on the train and headed back to good ol Dobbs.

      The last two days have been good New York City days.  On the 6th, I had to work as usual and disappointly had another failed attempt of getting a bank account situation situated.  However that did not phase me for Adam and I had tickets for Letterman.  Even though it was taped yesterday, tonight it airs on TV.  It was a real good time, and interesting to see how it all works.  On the way there I was fortunate enough to see some arrested for shop lifting, it was funny just listening to the cops.  Afterwards we needed to get back to Grand Central Station, its a quite a walk, but nothing too bad, however when its raining thats another story.  Even with an umbrella I still ended up getting drenched.  I was fortunate once again for I saw man get in a fight with the Taxi cab driver.  I don't know the situation, something obvisiously dealing with the payment and a miscommunication.  Pulling up to Mercy station it was dissappointing to see that it was still raining, but even harder.  Oh well.  So today was an excitin day at the Ad agency.  I was extremely busy and almost completed a powerpoint presentation that'll be provided to the brand manager of the account Im part of.  I also had to do other tasks.  Our account had a meeting, and it was interesting concept.  It seems there is going to be a lot of planning going on in the future.  Whether I'll be here or not at the time is still up in the air.  USSTC, has now had to pull all their Rooster brand ads to avoid the chance of being sued or penalized in the future.  As mentioned before there were articles in the paper, that they now have become paranoid over whether their ads seem directed to minors.  Recently Reynolds was sued for 20 million.  They reacted on the situation.  They also see their future on new product development.  What products they have in mind are uncertain.  Right now they are test marketing a product that is sort of like chew but in a wrapper thingy(best way I can describe it), that you put in your mouth to get a tobacco/nicotine fix.  Something that's not messy and would be used when you can't smoke like on a flight.  However a competitor is bring a same product to the market, and others coming up with ideas of other products or ideas to be used in the near future.  While probably no one reading this cares, it was a very interesting meeting.    The best thing about Fridays, Im out of there at 2.  You'll never guess what happened.  I got a bank account and ATM card.  YES!!!!! Finally.  After that I decided to go explore some of the city today, I walked well over a 100 blocks.  I walked to 5th, just to walk down it.  I ended up going to the Flatiron building.  Down to Washington park, where they have an arch, much like the Arch De Truimph in Paris, over to NYU, up to Union Park, then to Grammercy Park.  This last park is interesting for its just one city block.  However the only way to get in is to have a key, something only given to the residents near by.  And these resdients have some money, very nice arrangements.  Outside a restaraunt I heard a very good looking girl on the phone and over heard part of her conversation saying how she had an audition today.  I thought it was pretty cool.  I then went up to 30th street to meet up with Adam.  We then walked back down to Grammercy and Union.  At Union we saw a dad and his kids playing music.  It was fun to watch.  They might have been poor but they were having a time of their life and looked to be making a good amount of money on the side.  We then headed to 6th Ave and went north till about 41st.  Went in to according to Macy's the worlds largest store.  I don't think they are lying.  It was damn big.    As each day goes by, this city is growing on me.  There is just so much happening, the diversity, arts, etc...Plus everyone I meet is more than nice to talk to.  I don't know if I look like a New Yorker, but I've been asked directions numerous times and surprisingly enough I am able to help them.  Right now, you can't go wrong with the weather, its still in the 60's and 70's, but it is suppose to start warming up.  That's it, looking forward to the weekend.

      Another day, and another thought.  So Im on the chewing tobacco account, and today there was an article found in the Wall Street Journal bad mouthing the company that creates the product.  I then had to go to Grand Central Station to buy the NY Times and Boston Globe for similar articles.  They say its being advertised to youth, and while by law it has to be in a magazine where at least 80% are of the age 18 or older.  The internship has been an amazing experience, but I look at the people and wonder if they truly enjoy what they are doing.  Advertising, promoting a product that has a direct impact on people's health.  It is a moral dilemna for me this summer, but for now the experience does out weigh it.  I know I couldn't work on such an accout for a career, but at the same point they are trying to support themselves or family.  I also spent another day at the bank, and it looks like it'll take one more.  I'm pretty damn sure I'll be done with by tomorrow.  Adam and I walked around after I got off work.  Checked out the UN, and ate a nice lil cafe by Times Square.  The city is so enjoyable just to walk around seeing street performers and all the people.  So today I noticed that I can see Yankee Stadium from the train I ride every day, it only took 8 tries or so.

      Today was the second day on the job or the day I like to call a kick in the pants.  I have now been assigned four projects..they include creating a war room for the account. Putting together probably close to 100 powerpoint slides together for the brand manager of each division of US smokeless tobacco.  Doing research on why women in Sweden use chewing tobacco and if some how we can make this a reality in the US.  Finally going through magazines and looking for competitors ads to see the direction  they are using and putting together a document on it.  It sounded like a lot at first, but now it shouldn't be all that bad.  Today I heard more conversations from the lady who wants to be on Sex and the city or at least that's what I think.  She's in the cubicle on the other side and she likes to start her day by calling friends and playing the game guess who I went on a date with...followed by I didn't really like him.    I learned that when creative work needs to be changed in order to please the client, the creative person has an issue with it.  I also learned that the 99 cent value at Wendys really is a good deal.

      Today was my first day at Earle Palmer Brown.  I got up early to make sure everything would go ok.  I was about to iron my clothes with my brand new iron to open the box and see that parts were missing.  Thankfully Downy makes that wrinkle remover, it helped and thats all I can ask for.  I was suppose to get there at 9am, not wanting to be late on the first day I arrived 10 minutes early only to find myself waiting for anyone to show up.  Only the receptionist was there.  Anyways the job is good.  Their office is kind of trendy looking.  A guy named Tony is who I will be working with, I've been placed on the US Smokeless Tobacco account.  They are the leaders in the industry with Copenhagen, Skoal, Rooster, Red Seal, as well as some products in test marketing right now.  It's not the most ethical account, I mean the product does cause cancer.  However everyone on the account doesn't use it which I found funny.  We did the basic paper work, got my cubicle, computer, voice mail and stuff like that.  After lunch he started givign me Excel work to do, write cover letters to brand managers, and making sure the estimated costs were adding up.  I was like damn, but it wasn't too hard to do.   So today according to him was a good day for the magazines.  I was given two magazines in a black plastic wrap.  I thought they subscription must be almost over.  Nope it was Penthouse and Playboy.  See part of my job is to look through magazines finding competitors ads.  Besides thoughs we get ESPN, Sports Illustrated, and just about every hunting magazine one can imagine.  They are right now working on getting a sweepstakes with Rooster and either Maxim or Playboy.  I don't know if I will have a chance to work on it.  Today was also my second try at establishing a checking account.  I swear I need them to tag me like a dear for they don't trust me.  They wanted copies of bills, more than one ID.  They wanted a letter from my employer, I got it, and was told he would have to call and verify.  He now wants me to get a copy of my lease signed here at Mercy and brought to him this week.  I told him I dont think thats possible seeing how I work all day, he thought there must be a way.    Other than that the city is pretty interesting place.  I felt too old getting off with the suits and ties in Grand Central Station.  Walking through the mass of people makes you wonder just how small one is.  The weather here is incredible, as well as the view getting off the train.  It's quite a sight looking downstream of the Hudson and seeing the George Washington bridge and the skyline just a little further.  That's about it

      So actually something interesting happened to me at work.  Work recently has been boring.  My main supervisor is gone today and he is really the only one that gives me assigments.  All I've had to do today is get in contact with production to get extensions for placement of ads in magazines and pull together non disclosure forms and have them FedExed to the client.    So here's the story.  I'm sitting at my desk and this guy comes up to me.  He's like you got a minute.  I'm like yes.  He's like I'm Lou Carvel the creative director.  I don't know why, but the first thing I thought of was I did something wrong.  I'm like shit, the intern screwed up.  These thoughts shouldn't have happened because I've never met the guy, just always been a hello in the hallway.  He's like come with me.  I've seen you and I'm thinking I want you to be in the advertisement.  He's like a employee from the client is here and I just want you to meet her.  It was just casual talk about where I'm from and the question asked if I had ever modeled before.  I said no, and then some more casual conversation followed.  Lou's like you work here full time?  Saying yes, he's like I'll be in contact with you later this week and I headed out of the conference room.  I have no idea what the ad is for, if its anything big or exciting (something I very much doubt).  However I guess you could say I was flattered as this guy who can do casting calls and I'm sure has other resources wanted to get in touch with me.  Hopefully I'll know more by Thursday.  Other than that nothing is new.  Finished the second Harry Potter book last night and started on the third.

      I can say it's been an eventful last few days.  Friday there was not a thing to do, so my boss told me to ahead and go for the day.  Since I'm alone I really didn't have any plans so went over to Grand Central and ate and read over there.  I bought a newspaper called the "The Big News"  It's put on by homeless trying to improve their  lives.  A guy came down and sat next to me and told me about it, so I kind fealt like I should go ahead and buy it from him.  I decided to go check out a few art museums.  The first one PS1, is the Contemporary Art Institute.  All I can is there is some messed up stuff in that place.  I realize almost anything can be considered art by someone, but I just don't see how a video of a guy dressed like a devil dancing which was played on a TV in the corner of a room is art.  It's funny though.  Also the buildling was old and looked like an old school house.  The bathroom in basement had speakers playing creeping music and was only lit by orange Christmas like lights.  There was also a dummy hanging in there spinning.  There's no way I could take a dump in there without getting freaked out.  Afterwards I headed to the Museum of Modern Art. While a much nicer art museum it was 9 bucks and I didn't feel it was worth it(I'm not the greatest art fan).  However there were some nice pieces from Seurat, Picasso, Van Gough, Warhol, etc..  I then headed back to Manhattan and started on the second Harry Potter book.  Saturday I wasn't do anything really but sleeping in.  I was a reading a book when Elle called.  She has decided to break up with me.  I don't want to get into it any further, but all I will say is being all alone in NYC and depressed isn't the greatest.  I'm looking forward to getting back home.    After the call I needed to get out of the apartment.  I went to a bench to read and write.  Once again I saw an event that proved to me how rude people are here.  There was a lady probably in her early 70's and a guy in his late 50's, early 60's.  The old lady put on makeup and was looking in her compact mirror.  The guy in a sarcastic tone was like you don't need that you're already good looking and was laughing.  A guy who looked sort of trashy also started laughing as he overheard the conversation.  I wish I was larger for I would have said some things.  Still on the bench the trashy guy at one point tried to get my attention by waving his arms around, conductor like.  I took of my headphones and said, what?  He started laughing, so I put on my headphones.  Within five minutes he was at it again, but looking at me directly.  So I asked him what again.  He was like I'm hungry and there's a McDonalds do you think you can give me a bit of money.  I was like, No there is no way I'm giving you money.  He didn't look happy and neither was I.  That night I knew I needed to get out.  I went to see the new Austin Powers movie(funny, but losing it's charm) and so met up with Ty at NYU.  The dorms there are nice and have a pretty cool view too.  Here's a word of advice when ordering something at the cashier just don't point to it and say that looks good.  I tried that at Ben and Jerrys and the guy looked at me as if I should know what it was.    Sunday I didn't feel like doing anything.  I knew I needed to keep my mind busy and did some laundry and continued reading Harry Potter.  I'm almost done so that's exciting.    It is starting to get real hot again with high today and tomorrow around 96.  I am looking forward to getting back to Texas and hope these next two weeks or so fly by.  It isn't looking like that will be the case as it's only 12:15 and seems I've been here longer.  There is some drama at work as the client has now requested it'll take over production of the creative.  This means someone will probably lose their job and it also shows the that they might try and not use the agency all together, slowly killing it.  The people I work around the most are quite depressed as so am I.

      So I am holding down the fort here at EPB.  Everyone on my account is either on vacation or with the client in Connecticut.  What does that leave me to do?  Absolutely nothing.  I've read all day long and have now finished the Harry Potter book, the first one.  I plan on reading the other ones this week.  I also must say, the movie follows the book quite closely.  Other than that nothing else exciting.  Lunch was definitely my high point.  Yesterday I met up with a second cousin I've never seen before.  His name is Chuck and he and a partner have an architect firm.  It is located in SoHo which is a very nice part of town.  He took me to dinner in Little Italy, where we met up his sister and wife.  The place was enjoyable.  You don't even get to look at a menu, they just keep bring you food.  One thing that was entertaining is that they have a this contraption that is shaped sort of like a penis.  Basically you know its a penis for it has two ball like lights close together to resemble obvisiouly the balls.  Then a regular light bulb at the end of a pipe. So there is this cord you pull, causing the end to raise to the ceiling hitting a trigger which causes it to light up.  I really have no idea why it's in the restaraunt, but it was.  Only drunks seemed to pull it.  Which isn't a good thing since they seemed pretty rough with it.  While we were there twice the end light bulb shattered.  Wouldn't surprise me if glass got into peoples nearby foods.    Nothing else really excited happened. On the way home I got on the C instead of the A train.  It's no big deal, just the C has more stops and doesn't go as far as the A.  So I'm here reading, listening to my headphones and have oblivious to the world around me.  I didn't realize that we were stopped, and more importnatly didn't realize there was no one else on the train.  So some conductor came into the car and yelled at me, telling me to leave.  Ass.

      This week at work, I've really have had nothing to do.  So the days have become incredibly long.  However there is a plus side to it.  I have followed CNN and foxnews website daily, infact go to them a couple times a day to see if the headlines have changed.  I'm actually in tune with some of the stuff going around in the world.  If I think of anything I'm curious about I check it out.    I've also learned that Boise, Idaho looks like a good place to live and Bozeman is growing and was recently an All American city.  I've spent time looking up internships abroad and for the most part they all are associated with a cost.  I've caught up on my obsession with cars by reading through MotorTrend and Car and Driver, as well as going to the direct manufacture's website.    You learn the more you look at a clock the slower it's going to go.  I've also now decided to start reading books.  I got a free book on the way to the Hamptons awhile ago.  I read the first chapter and didn't care for it too much.  The lady's apartment I'm living in has the Harry Potter collection and I have now started reading those.   The weather today is in the 70's, something I am certain that Texas isn't in.  So when I graduate, I'm hoping the job market will be just fine and that I wil be able to land a job where I would like to go to.

      I'm trying to think of what has happened, but my I really can't remember if anything big happened last week.  Friday the 19th, Adam and I went to a club with some of his co-workers.  They thought it would be fun to take him to a strip club and wanted me to come along.  Supposedly the place is a dance club, and that turns into a strip club at 1am.  Well, it didn't and I must say I wasn't all that dissappointed.  It was hilarious though cause we were at this club called Jazz.  It was in the heart of Harlem.  Adam and I were the only white guys there and we some looks.  We just thought it was one of the funniest things.  While we were out of our element and we couldn't have had more fun.    The next day we slept in and then decided to head into the city and check out the Upper West Side.  We got on the 1 train and exited at Columbia university.  Columbia is an absolute gorgeous school. It surprised me, for NYU has buildings through out the city, with streets going through them and what not.  Columbia however has a real campus feel.  It is surrounded by iron gates and makes you forget how you are in USA's largest city.  Columbia is on 116th street.  After that we would walk down to 42nd street.  It was a good hike.  On the way down, we stuck to Broadway for the most part.  We saw the restaraunt you always see in Seinfield, and then we saw the real Kramer.  Supposedly Kramer's character was based around this guy.  He was giving a tour.  On the walk down we saw Lincoln center and that's really about it.  We also saw this guy dressed up like an angel, but he was really weird, for he wasn't on a busy street corner trying to get money.  Just sitting on a bench, it was odd but amusing.  Oh if you are ever in the city and want a good hot dog, go to Gray Papayas.  They are cheap and beat any street vendor.    At some point we made into Time Square and decided to go see a Broadway show.  What could be better than seeing Uncle Jessie from Full House in a show.  We didn't think anything could be so we bought tickets for Cabaret, staring John Stamos.  The show didn't start for awhile, so we decided to take a subway back to the apartment, shower and change and get back to the show.  However there was a power outage and the A train wasn't going anywhere.  So we found a place that has several eateries and more importantly A/C and just sat awhile.  We then got some dinner.  I went to this place called the food emporium.  They had prewrapped sushi and at the time it sounded good.  It wasn't.  At 8pm the play starts.  It was pretty amusing, but the plot threw me for a total loop.  The theater is in the old Studio 54 club, which made me wonder what it would have looked like back in the day.  Afterwards we walked outside and Adam ran into someone he knew from A&M.  They were going to some bars and we talked for some time.  We would have probably joined them, but you can say Adam and I weren't dressed for the occasion.  Hanging out a bit more we decided to head back to our apartment.  It was good to see that A train was up and running.  Sunday we pretty much hung out.  Monday I was in meetings.  Today there really isn't anything for me to do.  So I'm thinking it'll end up being a long day.  Thankfully I'm in the advertising business and have a lot of magazines at my disposale.

      Last night I received a call from my parents.  They had just spent several weeks up in Montana and wanted to let me know they made it back safely and all.  They also informed me that I had received a letter from the International Academy.  While they didn't read it, they just said sorry you didn't make it.  It's one of those things that just rips right into me.  I understand that there were a number of applicants and obvisouly ones that were more qualified.  It's is still a pain that digs into my center.  It makes me question myself.  I really have a hard time grasping failure.  It is a part of life, a part of everyones.     Instances like these make me question my future.  Now I realize while this is not the end and I will still have many opportunities, I catch myself wondering if I will succeed in life.  This and many other things I have not been accepted into.  I set expectations onto myself, but maybe they are too high.  I just don't want to be second best at times.  I know there is the whole concept of letting go and just taking it with a grain of salt.  It's a concept I need to work on, and hopefully I will.  On a different note the client was in the office and we had meetings all day due to that.  I am now ready to head to back to Texas.  I am really sick of this product and the damage it can cause on people.  While this wasn't mentioned, the client did admit that smokeless tobacco tastes like shit.  It's an image product.  It's not really the greatest image when you see the guy leaning over a garbage and spitting brown crap every half hour.

      Ok well I'll now continue my weekend story.  I had to eat lunch and actually do work related tasks.  After the bars we walked back to the hostel.  It was a long walk, but at least we were feeling good.  The next morning we slept in and then got ready and headed out to the Cape.  We got sort of lost looking for a Ferry, but finally found it and headed to Martha's Vineyard.  It was there that I finally was able to do what I had wanted to do since we got into Mass.  In Boston, since the roads go every which way I thought it would be cool to see the city by moped.  I checked around and not one place rented them.  It is a business opportunity that I am thinking about, however I would need to find something to keep myself occupied during winter.  Anyways....we get to Marthas Vineyard, put on our helmets and headed on out CHIPs style.  Excpet we weren't cops and couldn't get the the bikes above 30.  Martha's Vineyard is absolutely gorgeous.  It's what New England should look like or at least what I expected it to look like.  So we rode around for three hours or so.     One thing that was interesting was that there were a lot of Texans.  I was wearing my A&M shirt and got a lot of Gig Ems and stuff like that.  Had even some UT girl come up to me.  Oh which reminds me in one of the historic (BORING) places in Boston we stopped by an Aggie came up to me, class of 2000.  After the Vineyard, we get back on a ferry go in our car and head back to NYC.  Massachusettes was a new state for me to go to, and on the way back I was able to add another.  Rhode Island.  It's funny to me that the smallest state in the US has more people than Montana.  Gives you an idea of just how desolate the state can be.  The drive seemed pretty long.  We get into Dobbs Ferry to leave Adams car and wait for the last train to take us into the city and more importantly our stop of Marble Hill.  We get to sleep after 1 am.  It is safe to say that I'm dead tired.  On the hour commute into the office this morning I was afraid to close my eyes due to the fact that there would be a chance I would miss my stop.

      Last Friday, Adam and I decided to get up a little earlier to go see the Counting Crows play a few songs for a show on ABC.  It was free and was worth it.  I wasn't paying attention to the time and was late for work by only 15 minutes.  I felt bad, but then coming in and seeing hardly anyone here, the guilt went away.    Adam and I drove to Boston later that day.  It wasn't too bad of a drive.  One cool thing we saw was this guy decked out in red, white and blue.  Waving a flag from a top a hill to the traffic down below.  Just an odd fellow.  Nothing else exciting happened.  We got into Boston and drove around.  Their downtown you can tell is old for the streets are go every which way.  It was confusing.  We then made it to the hostel.  It was nice and there were three beds to a room.  We only saw the other guy once, it was in the morning and he was leaving.  We then got some dinner and walked around a bit that night.  The next day was a lot of walking.  I'm real curious to know just how much walking I've done this summer.  We basically did quite a bit on the Freedom Trail to which not one part of it interested me.  History is important and events should be documented, but man stuff bores me to death.     In the evening we went over to Cambridge and saw Harvard.  It's a nice school but didn't my expectations.  I was picturing real old buildings with ivy, but instead found red brick.  After dinner we went to this outdoor concert hall.  The Monkees were playing and Adam wanted to check them out.  Monkees aren't good and when the opener is Greg Brady who actually did a remix to Enimens song.  Could the real Greg Brady please stand up, please stand up.....then you know you are in for a crappy concert.  That night we then had some drinks at mock up cheers, then headed to a mexican restaraunt for some snacks.  Tex Mex is just good, and I miss it terribly.

      Last night I saw the best play I've ever seen.  I really haven't seen that many plays, but The Lion King on Broadway is amazing.  The set is just incredible and colorful.  The only thing that wasn't the best were our seats, we didn't have any.  I've been wanting to see this play for awhile now, but it is sold out through the summer.  So the day of the show they sell standing room only seats.  For $20 you can't go wrong.  I'd only recommend that you bring some comfortable shoes.  The weather is absolutely amazing.  In the middle of the day it is 70 degrees.  Makes you really not want to in the office.  This morning I realized even though my commute is close to a hour that I don't mind it at all.  I look forward to sitting down, putting on my headphones and heading in.  It gives me more time to wake up and just be relaxed for the day at work begins. It's also a good time for people watching.

      Today, I had a little adventure at work.  I had to show up earlier to pick up documents and ads that the client had been wanting to view.  Here's an idea to show you how laid back our office is.  Close to 8:30 in the morning, there was no in our office.  I knew the access code got in and headed back to Grand Central Station.  The adventure was that I have now set foot in another new state to me, Connecticut.  I didn't see much of it though for the hour plus train ride I fell asleep both ways.  I arrived in Greenwich (which from what I saw was very nice) and took a cab to the UST headquarters.  Dropped off some documents and then walked back to the station.  It has definitely made for a quick morning.    I also did some laundry last night in the basement.  It was either that or buy more boxers and undershirts, something that crossed my mind.  While my clothes were being washed I watched a little TV.  We don't have that many channels, but quite a few local cable access ones.  They can actually be pretty amusing.

      A lady was hit by a truck in front of my building, I showed up when the ambulance did.  Also a guy who runs a fruit strand across 44th street of our building was stabbed yesterday.  Ain't that some shit...     Out of all the weeks I have worked here, I think there have only been 5 days that I have ate something else besides peanut butter and jelly.  While a good sandwich, it's not the best

      Today has been a slow day, a day in which you pass the time dreaming.    I wonder if there truly is a job I will like to go to.  Or is work just work, something you find that will help you earn a modest living.  I hope thats not the case.  I want a job that excites me.  I want to know that the blood going through my veins is not going to be content typing up memos or working out numbers.  I want a challenge that I care for and in the end I hope it entails helping others.  On the extreme end, I really think I wouldn't mind not working.  I'd like to travel and see the world.  I'd like to take in everything I can.  Like today I was looking online at plays and events through out the city.  If I had the time and more importantly the money I bet they'd all be worth seeing.  If not enjoyable, maybe there would be a lesson learned.  I remember when I was a kid and wondered what I'd look like in highschool.  Everyone seemed so much bigger.  Then you get to highschool and by your senior year you think you know everything, or at least everything that you deem important.  College taught me and I'm sure many others elsewise.  I find it exciting not knowing what's going to happen in the next few years.  At the same time I know I will graduate by next December.  I realize the career I choose might not necessarily be the one I will grow old with, but it does make you wonder what is ahead.  I wonder when the time comes if I will be enticed by dollar or risk it and go down a different path.  I know Texas will not be home, but at the same time will I be able to find a job in an environment that interests me.  Leaving Montana I could not wait to live in a place that was diffferent and not so isolated.  College Station is close to big cities and now I'm living in one of the largest.  All I can think about is, while this is an amazing experience I need to go to a place where there is more grass than concrete.  Where there are more jeans than dress pants.  I see myself as being independent, but yet I don't want to graduate and be alone in a new enviroment.  I'd like to have some friends in the same city.  I'm not one that needs to hang out all the time, but one who is not content with just being with myself.  Well there's some Dave thoughts for the day.

      Well it's Monday after a nice 4 and a half day break, so fun times.  The extended weekend was great.  On Wednesday night I went to LaGuardia to pick up Elle.  It was funny cause I took a city bus to the airport.  I picked it up in Harlem and I think I truly reached the epitome of a white preppy boy.  Here I am in Harlem wearing a LaCoste shirt and nice cargo shorts on a city bus reading a Business 2.0.  There was another white guy on the bus with an empty seat by him, but I just sat down with someone near the front.  It was interesting for at the next stop another white person got on and went to the back passing up seats and sat next to the other white guy.  Instances like this show that we still have a ways of going before people see each other as equals.  The bus got crowded and I was the only one that ever gave my seat up and stood the rest of the way in.    I picked up Elle and it was great to see her, when then caught a cab and headed back to my apartment.  The next day we decided to check out  SoHo and Greenwich, areas Elle hasn't seen.  It would have been nice had it not been for the weather.  It was so unbelieviably hot.  We later escaped the heat and saw a movie Importance of Being Earnest.  It's not that good.  It was a little after 5, and I had heard you needed to head down to the river early if you wanted to have a good view of the fireworks.  Well we got there too early, and when we headed out for Elle to get a drink and cool off we were told by the officers that we would not be allowed back in for they had put the gates in place.  Since it was pretty much umbearable we headed on out and were able to catch most of the show on TV.    Friday we slept in and thought about what we were to do.  Fortunately the weather cooled down.  We checked out South Street Seaport.  It's a pretty area, but is basically a place that caters to tourists with shops.  That afternoon we went to a hotel I had made reseravations at.  I just thought it would be fun to have a day/night in the city.  The hotel was called the Hudson and it was probably the coolest place I've ever stayed at.  Very contemporary with funky elevator music.  We again saw another movie, this time on paper view.  The Beautiful Mind, I'd recommend it.    Saturday morning we took a taxi down to a bus stop for the Hampton Jitney.  We were heading out to East Hampton.  On the bus they had a steward or stewardess and in a way I found them amusing.  I was thinking if they someday hope to work in the airline industry.  The traffic got bad and it took us a little over three hours to get there.  Once we got there though I was amazed at the little town.  It was very quaint, but with nice/expensive stores along the main street.  Also there seemed to be a lot of beautiful people in fancy cars.  At one store we stopped in they had some benches near the front.  There were like three older guys, so I decided to join them.  At one point one of their girlfriends or wives came over  with an intended purchase in her hand, before she even talked the guy reached for his wallet and handed her his credit card.    After seeing the town we walked over a mile to the beach.  I thought the beach might have rough sand and the water be not the best, but the beach was great.  Then again it is the Hamptons.  We caught a bus back after 6 and then headed straight for the apartment.  The day wore me out.    Next morning we slept in and then once again headed to the airport.  I stayed for awhile and then we said our goodbyes.  So now I'm taking the city bus back to subway stop in Harlem.  Half way there I feel my pockets and there are no keys.  A place where I almost always have them.  I figure they must of fell out of my pockets and got off and the next stop to head back to the airport and check out where I sat and the Lost and Found.  Going through my backpack to put on my walkman I discovered them and really have no clue of putting them there.  I then took a nap on the bus and got off at my exit.  In all it took me well over 2 hours to get home.  That afternoon I just cleaned up my room a bit and got organized, followed by some TV.

      One more day of work and then its time for a 4 day vacation.  I can't wait.  I'm planning on seeing the fireworks and then going to the Hamptons for a day or so with Elle.  Last Monday, Adam and I continued with the Bryant Park movies and saw the classic The Grapes of Wrath.  I realize the movie is about the Great Depression, and it depicted the challenges a family would face.  However sitting down and watching this movie makes you depress as well.  Not because of the greatness of acting, it's just very boring.  Last night Adam and I made it to a baseball game.  Outside I had the best NYC hot dog yet, also the most expensive.  So instead of waiting in line to get tickets, we buy some bleacher seats from a scalper.  They were like 2 dollars more than they should have been so no complaints there.  We wait in line to get into the stadium only for a security guard to tell us backpacks aren't allowed.  Now I wouldn't have brought one in the first place, but coming straight from work left me really no choice.  Across the street there was a bag check area, for 5 bucks a person.  I had two dollars, so that wasn't going to work.  Since Adam also had a back pack we had to head back to the apartment.  We finally made it back to the stadium close to a hour and a half later.  It was the bottom of the fourth so there was still plenty of game left.    We had these cheap seats in the back bleachers, but I'm thinking it was the best place to sit.  We were with the "Bleacher Creatures."  The fans out there are ruthless, but in the funniest way.  They were making fun of other Yankee fans all around them.  The stuff they said was just hilarious.  Yankess ended up winning 10-6 or so.  There was a grand slam in 7th by the Yankees which was pretty exciting and sent many fans home.

      Another weekend has past.  Friday I got off at the usual 2 oclock and had to head up back to good ol Mercy college to pick up a letter.  I then had to wait forever for a train to get back into the city.  That night I met up with some fellow Fellows, Ty and Tiffany at a pub called Scruffy Duffys.  They had brought along other interns or friends they knew working in the city.  It was an educated bunch from colleges like Princeton and Stanford.  The internships ranged from doing investment banking to being a runner on the floor of the NYSE.  It is no doubt in my mind that if they want to be successful, they will.  An old ag that works for Morgan Stanley came by for it is the same place Tiffany works at.  He then took some of us boys across the street for what was sort of Mexican food.  It wasn't the best, but was free so that was nice.  We then went up to his apartment.  While it wasn't that big, it was very nice with an incredible view.  He lives right close to the center of Times Square.   Adam later met up with us.  Taking the subway back there was a bum asking for donations.   I know this is going to sound mean, but I think this was the funniest bum I seen yet.  He was going from subway car to subway car.  Now he's wearing black pants, and then a garbage bag for a shirt.  Anyways he's real loud, and yells, "I haven't ate all day.  Please some one help me." No one gives this guy a dime and he looks just funny.  The thing I didn't get was the trash bag looked new, plus he wasn't all that skinny.  He was just a strange fellow, and I saved my laughter for later.  The next day Adam and I decided to check out some museums.  We went to the Cloisters.  Which looks like an old Spanish Monestary.  It was built in europe but brought over by Rockafella brick by brick and now is an medievel art museum.  After that we headed in to the city and went to the Met, saw some Monets, Van-Goughs and the like.  While I do feel art is something that should be perserved and be in public viewing, I just don't care for it.  I find it fascinating at how all the pottery people were able to construct in ancient times, to the details of some of the paintings.  However I become immensly bored at art museums.  It's just not my thing at all  We then headed down and got some grub at a diner.  Afterwards we had some time and decided to go to Coney Island.  Coney Island=ghetto.  To me it was a disappointment.  It basicaly now looks like a carnival, with rides like the Zipper and such.  There is only one roller coaster.  There was so much litter.  We also found out that late at night there are more crazy people than normal people that ride the subways.  One guy (will call him Bob) wanted to get in a fight with the guy (will call him Frank)across from him.  Bob got off, before Frank did.  Bob had a friend (he'll be James).  James then apologized for the Bob's behavior.  Frank said it wasn't a problem.  Bob was drunk.  Then James and Frank get talking on all sorts of shit.  Frank moved to NYC 20 years ago and I quote said, "New York, I built this fucking city."  That and numerous other comments exchanged were funny.  Sunday, Adam had to work so I just hung out at the aparment.  I then went into the city to run to the bank and try to find a hair cut.  While walking around I saw a girl who looked familiar but I didn't think anything of it.  It turns out to be a girl I had met in NYC from A&M over spring break.  She was at this same club a bunch of Fellows were at.  Anyways she recognized me and said you go to A&M.  I was like  yeah, and then I remembered her.  So that was fun.  Not finding a place in midtown, I decided to hop on the subway and go to to Union Square/NYU area.  I found a barber shop and it had pictures of some famous people on the outside like Adam Sandler.  So I figured it must be somewhat decent.  They must of had over a dozen people cutting hair.  It was funny cause they were all talking in Spanish or some toher language just joking around.    that is pretty much my weekend.  Everyone on the account I'm on is either out of town for vacation or at a business meeting in Connecticut.  So I don't even have to pretend to look busy.

      It is hard for me to imagine that today is my last day on the job here at EPB.  In about a hour and a half I will be done and my NYC experience will be drawing to a close.  I look back at the beginning and not having an idea of what was in store.  I keep on thinking of all that I have seen and experienced.  I feel so fortunate.  I keep on remembering the Dave in highschool.  The one who was content with just going to school and hanging around the same friends.  The same kid who had many fears.  I still do today, but this summer I truly feel that when the time comes to graduate that I have in essence prepared myself.  I am excited what lays ahead.  Same time, I'm definitely looking forward to the next year or so of college.    Whether I'm a changed person, that is something I doubt.  I still am very much easily entertained and still very much have the same sense of humor I did coming here. New York didn't make me hard.  NYC was a chapter in my life, and one I'm saddened it's about to close.  Here I have been, imensing myself in a whole new area of US, that is quite different than anywhere else I've been.  Like a book, it feels like it is being slammed shut.  Tomorrow night I will be in Houston.  Over a thousand miles away from a city that I might not return to for quite some time.    Life confuses me like that.

      This past weekend was the last one in the Big Apple for me.  What else to do, but go explore.  Friday I hung out at the apartment and read, but then met up with a friend at Union Square for a late night dinner.  We went to Blue Water Grill and had some good seafood.  I guess it must be pretty good because the earliest reservation we could get was at 10:30.  Afterwards we went back to his NYU dorm and hung out.    Saturday I slept in and then decided if NYC is the one of the greatest cities to shop I might as well buy something.  I walked around quite a bit and realized just how much I don't like shopping.  I ended up with a one long sleeve shirt and a t-shirt.  Afterwards it was getting pretty hot so I decided to go check out the movie Signs and get a lil A/C at the same time.  I recommend the movie, it was a  good flick.  Heading for the exit I saw how Road to Perdition was about to start.  I figure hey, if I spent 10 bucks for a ticket I might as well get to see two shows.  So I snuck in.  That also is a good movie.  Afterwards I grabbed some Subway and then took the subway on home.  Sunday I wasn't planning on doing anything, but read.  However I kept on thinking I need to go out because it'll be awhile before I am back here.  I hadn't been to Brooklyn yet so what to do but go there.  I checked out an area called Willliamsburg.  I then went to their large park  called Prospect.  They have the Brooklyn Botantical gardens and it was listed in a book I have to be one of the must sees.  I saw for a student it only cost a buck fifty.  Obvisiouly that isn't bad so I went ahead.  However not with more than ten minutes walking along the paths and looking at plants I asked myself why.  Sure it didn't cost much, but plants aren't my thing.    Yesterday at work I was suppose to go to a photo shoot, watch them take photos of a coffee machine for the packaging.  However there was a UST(the account I'm on) meeting and felt I should attend.  I never ended up going to the shoot, but must say I wasn't all that dissappointed.    Last Spring break I bought a fake watch, that I soon would realize didn't work.  I was determined to go back to Chinatown and get one that does.  I walked and walked and walked.  I was only going to go to one or two more before I gave up.  Then there it was, a watch that I caught my eye.  I hadn't seen one like it at all the other places.  I payed the 10 bucks, had them adjust the size and I was on my way.  What even makes this watch all the better.  I looked at it this morning and it was accurate.  Also in Chinatown, since the cologne is considered to have "fallen off the truck" I figured it would be a good chance to get the real thing at a much discounted price.  I love how you haggle prices with them.  Here's some dialogue.  How much? 22 Nevermind(knowing he'd say make a deal) I give you good price I'm thinking 15 You can't get it for fifteen. Well thanks anyways Sir, wait, 17. No, I'm only willing to pay 15 Come on, you need to compromise.  You are being cheap. Hey I just only want to spend 15, started walking away Ok sir, just for you 15.    After that I was getting hungry and grabbed some good ol Popeyes chicken around Times Square.  Then back on home afterwards.  I must have ridden 6 different trains in all yesterday.    Today I have been busy with billing.  The billing guy is an idiot and my supervisor just goes crazy.  I admit it's ridicolous.  I went through 30 invoices or so, and I'd say 10 were correct.  He never gets them perfect each month, but by far this has been the worst.  For lunch my supervisor and another guy took me out.  It was really great just to sit and talk with them.  I wonder what is in store for them down the road, where they will end up, or go to next.  Again times like these make wonder why we meet the people we do.  I don't think I'll ever see anyone here in the office ever again after tomorrow.

      It's finally Friday.  However that doesn't mean much will change.  I've been reading books at work and then after work go Central Park and read some more.  I've now completed the Harry Potter series.  I am dissappointed for they have been very enjoyable reads.  I have now started on the series Tales of the City.  The co worker that let me know about the apartment, told me I they are good reads.    I have nothing planned this weekend and think I'll spend most of my time in the park reading.  I might go to Chinatown and by a few cheap knock offs, but will see.  This is my last weekend in the city and I just want to enjoy it.

      The weather is back to being great.  Yesterday after work I decided to go down to the financial district and catch the Staten Island Ferry.  It's a nice little ride and you get to see the city and the Statue of Liberty which is nice.  I then headed to Central Park to read and once it got dark headed back to the apartment.

      Here's an update of what I've done. Nothing.  I've been reading which is good, but there just isn't much for me to do.  Actually there is nothing for me to do.  I have an example to prove it.  A co-worker was going to try and get the Shakespear in the park tickets.  So on lunch we headed out there.  Saw the line was too long, which then convinced her just how early you have to get there for seats.  Anyways we walk through the park, get back to midtown and then grab some lunch.  I was gone for a little over 2 hours.  Which is twice as long as my break should be.  No one really seemed to notice that I was gone that long.  So now it's back to Harry Potter.  It should be done after tomorrow, which has me wondering what I'll read next.

      Determined to see a play  Twelfth Night, a Shakespear play in Central Park was something that I thought would be fun to check out.  It's been going on for a month or so and only has one weekend left.  The play is filled with stars such as Julia Stiles, Oliver Platt, Christoper Loyd, and the list goes on.  Now the play is free and I had heard how you have to get there early when they start handing out tickets at 1pm.  So Saturday I got there at 9:30 and the line was four blocks long.  I was in a section that was questionable, but in my opinion was a definite no.  I didn't stay long and was determined to see it then on Sunday.    Sunday I was much better prepared.  I woke up early and was in the subway station by 6:30 in the morn.  I got to the park by 7:15 and there was already quite the line.  I was in definite good standings.  I was also much better prepared with a sack lunch, four water bottles, cd player, something to sit on and a book.  Thankfully there were trees for it was a definitely hot day.  Also fortunately there was someone behind me in line that was alone too.  Her name was Jenn and was in mid twenties.  We both just talked for pretty much the whole time and played some games she had.  It definitely made the time go by quicker.  Afterwards I headed back to the apartment and took a nap.  The play was well performed and funny.  However the plot as a whole I was not able to follow all that well.  Shakespear as a whole I'm just not able to follow.  It was still a good time. And hey it was free too.

      The coolest NYC experience.  So who might you see in Maxim, Rolling Stones, etc.  ME.  Today was the photo shoot I had been invited to.  While I didn't think they would choose me they ended up doing so.  It was so crazy.  I was at this badass studio in SoHo.  The campaign is for the satellite radio company Sirrius.  Anyways the ads will show face shots of people dressed like the music they listen to.  A good example is a guy wearing western wear to show he listens to country.  What they had me wear was punk stuff.  So I met with the stylist and tried on a few things.  I ended up wearing a small black tank top, dog collar kind of neckace, some crazy bracelet and a lip ring.  They then sent me to a hair stylist who made my hair crazier than it usually is..  I've gotten some looks since.  It'll take forever to shower it all out tonight.   Anyways the took a couple rolls of film and I was done.  I just thought it was such an amazing experince.  It was what I always thought it would look like.  Way too many people than needed, tables full of good food and people drinking all these healty drinks.  It was fun just to talk to the models in the back.  One was from europe and she was just funny.  It was also funny because the photographer and the client representative just thought I looked funny as punk.  They were like you are just too nice of a southern kid.  I had to agree.  So Monday or Tuesday I find out if I made the cut and will appear in the magazines.  I hope so, but I'm not counting on it.  Even so I can't emphasize how much fun it is and they memory I have from it.  I also hung out with a coworker that day who I never really had the chance to.  She and I just had the greatest time making fun of each other and even getting lost finding the place.  It's too bad I'm just meeting her now or it would have been fun to hang or chit chat with her.  Afterwards I headed to Grand Central and read and ate dinner.  I decided to see if the internet cafe in Times Square was open and in fact it was.  Which brings us to now.

      Today we have a meeting all morning so that'll be nice.  You can't go wrong with bagels, juice and doing nothing.  Yesterday was somewhat interesting.  We went to check out this new technology.  It's this hologram technology that is amazing in the quality.  Straight out of Star Wars or some other future thing.  We now want to present it to the client so they can have it in bars or behind counters at convience stores.  It's allready in a few places in Europe.  It was really kind of fascinating.  After that I met with my boss and we both got on the same track with regards of what needs to be done.  So anyways I get a call with about 15 minutes till I'm in the clear and can go home.  Someone in production asked for help on an Excel task.  I told them I could stay a little later, and I ended up being here till past 7.  It was just me and one other person.  I had nothing to do, and I did volunteer so I guess I don't have a right to complain.  Still I don't get payed for the extra hours.  But however last week I left early almost everyday and got payed for hours I didn't work.  It all balances out in the end.  Today I saw a guy in the subway wearing a Members Only jacket.  Those are so old school.  Oh last night on one of the local cable channels they were showing stand up comedians.  It wasn't edited and was hilarious.

      Well its the day after my ski trip and I've decided to go ahead and write down everything I can remember, because well it might be fun to read later on in life.  So on 9am we left College Station to meet up with the others in Denton.  We ate at Braums before hitting the road.  I think the funniest thing was when Gran called Karen, X.  The worst joke by far.  We drove to Raton New Mexico that day and got in somewhat late.  The best thing about drives are you really have the chance to get to know people.  And how the littlest things can become funny....like a Big Ol Slice of Pizza or filling up the car and not paying attention and watching gas go everywhere.   Also the saying little boobs, big boobs.  In Raton we met up with the Dyers at some cheap hotel, where even their lounge had a cover.  Ridicoulous.  We watched a lil football,  Miami and Ohio State.  A great game.  The girls room was crazy hot, our room was cold at night, but yet no one turned on the heat because we each wondered if the other was cold.    The next day was destination Breckenridge.  We stopped at the Royal Gorge for a little side trip.  Gran was a little pissy about it, I thought it was kind of funny.  We made it up there and people got their rentals in a huge line.  I went to Frisco with gran and eddie to get groceries and waht not.  Which we hardly reimbursed for, but I could pretty much care less.  We get back to the Condo which everyone had checked in by now, so alas I was left with the hideaway.  I really hate those beds.  First day on the slopes was the coldest.  Still hopping on skis is like riding a bike it all comes back.  Everyone was surprisingly good at it too. I didnt want to do anything too crazy that day, but I was nailed by a snowboarder.  It was a good crash though.  I'd give it 9 points.  That night we cooked a spaghetti dinner and it was a success.   That night was pretty much just a chill night.  Did a little hot tubbing, but the hot tub wasn't even outside so boooo for that.  The next day just some more skiing and one huge crash.  I even cracked my goggles.  However the weather was gorgeous and would remain for all the other days skiing.  We decided to hit up happy hour, which then became dinner which then became crazy.  After the mexican restaraunt we went to Breckenridge Brewery which is a cool little bar.  I had some shots and beer, met a Bosnian guy and met a nice lady from England who told us about wankers.  We then were trying to find another bar, but ended up finding a dance place where we tore it up on the floor.  We were the only ones to tear it up.  A funny site.  So we went out, and out hard for like 7 hours that night.    The next day met up with the roomie for some skiing.  Even became adventorous and started doing some double diamonds.  It was good, but I didn't feel to hot.  I went to bed like at 9 that night.  Just kind of chilled by myself  Final day was probably the greatest.  I stuck to the hard part of the mountain and enjoyed every minute of it.  After our typical meet up at the Vista Haus for lunch.  A group of four of us decided to make the hike to the summit of peak 8.  It took us a little less than a hour.  It seemed liek the air just got thinner with each step.  Several times you just had to stop and take a break.  Once we made it to the summit we took our time.  Took some pictures....almost didn't happen but told them how to fix the battery.  Made a huge block A&M up there.  Then jumped into the bowl which was incredible skiing.  Made you feel good to be alive kind of thing.  Last night we have to go out.  We went to the Breck bar where tried to get away without paying for a pitcher...it didn't happen. Went to another place for just a bit then partied it up  and brought it back to the condo.   I'll write more later......

      Counting Crows version of Big Yellow Taxi is on.  I love the Counting Crows.  I am writing from my new room.  It's really nice, but no view.  Still much more enjoyable then the last place.  So tomorrow my european adventure begins.  We have a break, so its time to fill up the backpack, load up the camera, put on the sneaks, see some culture, eat different food, hope Engish will be all I need, and hear some stories in the hostels.  I really can't wait.  I'll write it about it when I return.  Nothing else is new.  My project management group is worthless.  I'm even tempted to drop it and take all my research with me.  Then I'd be a jerk though.  Still, they are the most incompetent group I've ever been involved with.    I got a haircut at his beauty school place.  So it was cheap, which is nice.  Also the main instructor was the only one that knew good English so she started it and then had the student take over.  All in all I was happy.  A little short, but thats fine by me.  The weather keeps on getting better. I walked around yesterday and finally took some pictures of the town.  Been here for a month and have only used one roll.  I need to start using it a bit more.    Need to tie up some loose ends.

      I realized something last night.  I've been here for a month and in no such way does it feel like its been that long.  I've also realized that I haven't smoked out yet even though I pass "coffee shops" everyday.  Well last night I met up with some friends at the movie theater to see 8 Mile.  I guess it takes awhile for movies to make it overseas.  It was funny because at the theater you can buy beer.  I guess the only reason I find this humorous is because I know of people back home that sneak it in.  On the downside every movie has a 10 minute intermission.  On the bike ride back I was crossing the river back to the main part of town, back to the dorm.  I never saw Maastricht from this view at night, and it was the best view of Maastricht I've seen.  I came to appreciate exactly where I am now.  In going to the movie I missed out on International dinner night on my floor.  We have Spanish, Peru, Poland, Hungarian, and French people so the food did look varied andgood.  Anyways I hung out with them and I realized I might actually miss the people.  So in one of our lying in our beds roommate talks Matche informs me how the Hungarian guy said Americans are stupid.  I am curious about how the converseration would have gone if I had been in the room.  I'd say Americans have achieved quite a bit more and not out of luck, but out of obtaining knowledge and being determined.  The Hungarian guy shaves in our kitchen, I am able to shave in my room.  I feel I am the smarter one.    Below is a Dutch email.  I don't know why, but I get quite a few from the school.  When they are important they send along an English version as well. De studentenpsychologen van de Universiteit Maastricht organiseren wederom een faalangsttraining.  Faalangst kan ervoor zorgen dat je minder presteert dan je van jezelf mag verwachten.  In de faalangsttraining zal in 7 bijeenkomsten, die elk 2 uur duren,  aandacht besteed worden aan aspecten die faalangst doen ontstaan dan wel in stand houden en vooral hoe je daar zelf iets aan kunt veranderen.

      Dave loves the bank and faxing here....not really.  First off the bank, rents due and you have to transfer it through the bank.  Well I decided to transfer money into my account via Visa card.  They only accept MasterCard, so there goes my assumption that the two were the same company in disguise.  So I decide to go ahead and use the ATM machine.  I CAN'T GET MONEY.  I really have no clue, because here I am at the library checking my bank account and sure enough there is money in it.    Well I thought I had found a fax machine.  The apartment complex told me they sent it and got a reply that they don't know a David Hoffman.  I'm sure they don't know who I am, there are over a 1000 international exchange students.  I'm just hoping they held onto the fax.  It's only open for a hour a day so that makes it real convenient.  I think I have given up on the waffles here.  I was beginning to think I was eating too many.  I'm actually in some of the best shape ever, or so I tell myself.  I run to and from the gym which is a mile or so.  Bike or walk a lot during the day and actually eat pretty decent.  Maybe all this exercise is starting to pay off.  My cough only went away several days ago.  Speaking off biking, its crazy here,the cars get right next to you.  Still haven't got hit yet.  Got to run, but here are some links.  They are photo galleries.  A lot of the stuff in them are places I've been or of Maastricht. http://www.pbase.com/rainmaker30   This guy is my future roommate http://www.pbase.com/smittysoup      A girl from Seattle website.  In one picture I'm doing dishes....amazing.  Actually I do dishes almost everynight.  It's a way to get myself out of cooking

      I realized I can say thank you in six languages, four fluently.  Do you ever look at where you are in life and wonder just how did you get where you are?  Saturday night, I was in an American owned, Mexican themed restaraunt in Luxembourg, drinking Belgium beer, listening to French people karokee.  All I could do was just look around and smile.  I was sitting there thinking I could never have planned this.    Anyways Saturday morning, my future roommate(Todd) and I decided to go to Luxembourgh for the weekend.  We didn't know what was there, but figured it would be fun to say we went.  After three train rides we arrived to the city.  Not too much detail, but it was really a beautiful city, my favorite Europe experience so far.  We explored a bit and realized we were starving.  We wanted to eat, but Luxembourgh is an expensive city.  We found a place called Quick burger, I'd say its pretty much a McDonalds(which was two buildings down).  The lady taking our order just laughed at us because well we were confused.    Afterwards we decide to find the hostel, which took a long time.  We checked in to our closet, I mean room, no closet.  Best way to describe it.  We then decided to head back into the city and take it all in.  Had dinner at a nice place then ended up at the bar for karokee.  The Dj was in his 50s and that made it all the more enjoyable.    The next morning we grab some breakfast in the hostel and then go back to the town.  Walking around we realized that we practially saw everything the day before.  Not a thing was open, but that seems common here on Sunday.  We did find a tourist stop and witnessed one of the funniest things ever.  Tobacco is cheap in the Luxembourg and my friend was thinking of buying a cigar.  Well the guy behind the counter was adamant that he smell the quality.  He would shove the cigar right against one of Todd's nostrils and then shove it against the other.  I had to leave or I would have started laughing.  Just had to witness it.  Not many people get to Luxembourg, and we wanted to get our Passports stamped.  Since so much travel happens between the EU they don't bother stamping passports.  We were deteremined to find a way around this.  We go to this information desk and explain to her our situation.   Well she stamps our passport, but it says Luxembourgh information.  Not really a passport stamp.  She smiled and so did we.  Train ride back was a little interesting.  We met an old WWII vet and well he decided to tell us some stories.  Lots and lots of stories.  I didn't want to disrespect the man and start reading, so I pretended to slowly nod off.  He noticed and said go ahead son get some sleep.  I put on the headphones and was safe.  Todd on the other hand wasn't so lucky.    On this trip Todd and I got to really get to know each other.  He's a great guy, one I can truly joke around with but differences became apparent.  He's an NYU finance guy with big dreams.  He says he can't picture himself retiring and knows he'll be working the 80 plus hours a week when he starts.  Then hopes to move out to Connecticut, buy his Porsche and do the commute thing.  I can see it happening.  It's truly great he has his dreams and ambitions, but I feel life is more than making a lot of money and then dying rich.  You need to get out there and experience it.  Sure he might have more financial wealth, but I wonder whose personal wealth will be better.  I can only hope it'll be mine.    So back in the dorm I visit with the good Polish roommate.  He was excited for he had bought some cologne while he was in Germany taking exams for the past week.  He hadn't finished his courses before arriving to Maastricht.  The only advice I could give on the cologne was to make sure your girlfriend likes it.  He was like you are a smart man.  I just nodded my head.  Another thing I noticed is how many more cards I have on me.  Two phone cards, a prepaid chip knip, a regular chip knip(equivalent to a Dutch Debit Card), a student ID, a student enrollment ID, an extra insurance card, a gym membership card, hostel card, and then the passport.  Just ridiculous.

      The weather is finally starting to turn around. Its been sunny the last few days, and even was relatively warm yesterday.  I think through the weekend it'll stay in the 40s which should be nice.  The town square has now brought tables and chairs outside.  I on the other hand am stuck in the library on a Friday, a day I don't even have classes.  Woo Hoo!!!  So here's the big news for the day.  The Dutch love bicycles, since its pretty much flat through out the country and economical they do make sense.  It amazes seeing a mom with two kids on a bike, or ladies in heels and skirts using such a mode of transportation.  Well I've been in search for one since the 25 minute walk to class is getting old.  Yesterday I had class across the river and decided to check out the shop by the train station.    No luck.  I had also heard of this guy who has a lot of bikes in his back yard(I'm guessing stolen bikes).  I walked for a hour and never such a place more or less a back yard even.  This morning I pass two shops on the way to school. The first one had some used ones but for over a hundred euros.  The second one had one for 45, this is the cheapest I've found here.  So another American capitalistic thought, sell cheap bikes over here.  Mine is a clunker, but that gives it some character.  Like most Dutch bikes it has a head and tail lamp.  Also a bell you get to ring if a pedestrian is in your way.  For some reason my bell has  picture of two clowns on it.  Strange.  So I rode the bike to the library and it was a bumpy ride, these cobblestone roads aren't the best.  Anyways I figure its a wise investment and should be able to sell it to a foreign student for about the same price when I leave.  I'm just hoping it doesn't break anytime soon.  Also the show the Osbournes was on TV last night.  They don't edit it over here, caught me by surprise.

      So today I needed to find a place to receive faxes.  I am trying to renew my lease in College Station and was told it needed to be done rather soon. First  place the Guesthouse.  I know they have a fax machine, however they told me I couldn't use it even though I offered to pay.  The next place, International Relations Office.  Its only open 1 hour a day, and I don't know what hour that is.  Copy shop, nope.  Post Office, nope, but you can send them.  Second copy shop, nope.  I go ahead and email the International office and have received a reply with a fax number in the message.  Thankfully, and all it took was a lot of walking and close to 2 hours.    One of my favorite things to do here, is listen to my headphones to and from school.  I absolutely love music(favorite art form by far) and it helps make the walk seem shorter.  Batteries went out today so that's not fun.    Another thing I've really grown to love are group dinners.  I have several friends who are in the another building(one I am moving into on March 1st, so yeah for that) and rotate cooking.  I was suppose to cook Monday, but I had a conflict.  Eventually I'll cook, but for now I just do the dishes for them.  The food is surprisingly good.  Plus, I always get free water from the tap.  The carbonation issue has continued to be a problem with me. Some juices at the grocery store have it and even at a restaraunt it seems Lipton has created carbonated ice tea.    Some good news.  I've finally met a sarcastic Dutch girl.  I realize cultural barriers exist, but I still am very much a sarcastic person.  However finally I met someone over here whose not American and dishes it right back.   It's finally been brought up that I am very much an American.  The main thing is my bright Columbia jacket.  Everyone wears dark coats, but not me.  My yellowish jacket is just too much.  Also someone introduced me to an Italian girl who was on my floor last night.  She's like oh you are the American that lives here.  I was like is it that obvisious.  She said yes.  So basically I was in bed about to fall asleep and there is knock on my door.  They are about to have dessert on my floor and want me to join.  It took some convincing, but I put on some clothes and joined them in the kitchen.  Somehow I ended up being the only guy there.  There were quite a few Spanish speaking girls there that wanted me to try and speak Spanish.  All I have is two years of highschool, so pretty much what ever I said they would laugh at.    It seems my Project Managment course continues to spiral downwards.  My group just isn't coheisive and I find them to be lazy.  Since I have three Dutch kids in my class I would have thought one of them would assume the leadership role that always develops in group projects of the past.  It seems they didn't and I've now assumed the role.  I've tried to motivate them, but have found little success.  It is possible that I may drop the course, for passing the course is starting to look uncertain.  I will still give it a couple weeks to see if anything develops.  Fortunately this won't affect my graduation plans or anything.  However failure comes to my mind.  It is something I don't deal well with.  I can't stand to think that I gave up, I feel I have to prove to myself that anything can be accomplished.  I'm not so much worried about letting others down, as I am letting myself down.  Even though I know others have dropped classes here already, I feel I shouldn't be one.    Classes here are just interesting and different.  Last week I had to lead the class in discussion for two hours.  For the most part I'd say I did a good job.  Then I was listening to some classmates in my other class and could clearly tell they were BSing, I wonder if others could pick it up when I had to.  Also I am constantly burried in excerpts from journals, books, or other readings assigned by the professor.  Now and then I wonder about my own English as these texts have so many words I am unfamiliar with.  Usually I can come to understand the terms using the text around, but an English dictionary would have been a wise thing to pack.  I have hard time understanding how the students who aren't native to the English language can handle the readings when they can't even handle the lecture.    Time for lunch.

      Will call this one, a really long journal entry.  So I haven't had much time on the Internet the last week or so.  I feel so disconnected with the world, and in reality it should be the other way around.  Here I am, immensing myself in a new culture, a new place, awakening my senses and yet I feel distant to the world.  So lots has happened in the last week. Tuesday night was international night at a local pub.  The theme was Spanish night, so they had specials on sangria.  It was a good time and just funny.   I've come to realize that all these people I meet I probably will never see them again so why not dance (something I pretty much refuse to do at home).  On a whole, I'd also have to say Americans in general have better rhythm than most europeans.  I've also noticed the Spanish seem to have the most fun.  In addition, I also wonder now and then what happens as we grow old.  Here were people from all over the globe having a good time.  A smile is universal.  Maybe Sadam and Bush should get together and just go out.  I realize the issues there are more complex and one I might not have a full understanding of.  I would just like to see a peaceful resolution.     One thing I like about here is when I leave a pub.  Instead of seeing parking lots and gas stations, I walk down cobblestone roads and see buildings older than America itself.  A dislike is the 30 minute walk back to Guesthouse.  Taxis are here, but cost way too much.  A trip from the train station to Guesthouse which is a few miles was over 10 euros.  Ridicolous.  Maastricht has also made me realize how great Febreeze and Woolite is.  Since cigarette smoke is just about everyone, it gets old smelling like the Marlboro man himself.  Speaking of Marlboros, I thought of a quick profit scheme.  Load my suitcase with them here and then sell them when I get into the States.  They are dirt cheap here.  It seems being the typical American that I am, I brought way too many clothes, but not enough underwear or socks.  This is where Woolite comes in.  Instead of paying 4 euros a load for laundry, now I just use a lil woolite.    This weekend I went on a Discover Holland trip.  We  went all over the country by bus and I do mean all over.  It was a group of about 60 kids and from this I knew the trip would have its faults.  We get to Rotterdam that night and go out for dinner.  It didn't even feel like Valentines, but that is fine by me.  We then went to a pub, and then to dance club.  Now this club called the Baja Beach Club was exactly the kind of place you wouldn't go to at home.  It looked like a beach on the inside with both guy and girl bartenders wearing bathing suits.  If you wanted to, you could do a body shot off of them.  Didn't really interest me, but it did for most of the others. Definitely a good laugh though.  A guy and I were like this is too much lets go find some culture.  We decided to head back in the direction of the hotel and find a local pub.  Instead what we got was a tour through Rotterdam.  Did you know if you take a wrong turn, keep walking down it and don't realize it you can end up lost.  Well we got lost, and eventually found our way back to the hotel by 4 in the morn.  A little side note, guess who was the only one kicked out of the club.  A drunk American in our group who thought it would be fun to jump on stage.    Next morning into the bus and to the beach.  Its below zero celsius.  Beach wasn't much fun.  Next stop, some town I can't pronounce.  It was a typical Dutch village or as like to say a typical Dutch tourist trap.  Here you could buy cheese, see wooden shoes being made or see some windmills.  It was alright, but again very cold.  So now I decided to be the stupid American with another guy.  The little creeks/river was frozen, ducks can walk on it.  Can humans?  I kind of tested it near the shore and it felt solid.  So a guy and I get out on it.  We are about half way and then the ice cracks.  We had panic stricken faces, but knew we couldn't move fast because it's ice.  We ended up making it back on the land and dry thankfully.    Next stop was Utrech, which is a pretty big/young town.  We had a cool little hostel.  Went out for some dinner, then a city tour/pub crawl.  I don't quite know why the Dutch like to take us on these tours when it is so cold.  Anyways the pubs were ok, I didn't drink all that much, but my coaster collection keeps getting bigger.  I've decided I needed to collect something while I'm away.  That night we ended up at another club and made it back by 4 in the morn.  Next morning I wake up to hear the guys from North Carolina discussing how many "space cakes" they should have for breakfast to get messed up on with.  I never found out their answer, but instead did some sight seeing in Utrech. We climbed the Dom Tower, which was built a really long time ago.  It had close to 500 some steps, but the view was worth it.  I'm always amazed at what people were able to build in the past.  We also took a little canal tour.  Our guide didn't have the best English, but that was fine by me.  Back on the bus we head to another Dutch town to go visit a small brewery and distillery.  If you haven't noticed the trend, the Dutch like to drink or take us exchange students drinking.  It was interesting though.  However on this trip I came to realize a few things.  Never travel in groups, people become really indecisive.  Also if you are abroad and someone is loud, it most likely is an American.  I also realized its fun to play up your stereotype with others when you all realize its a joke.  I was having a coffee with a french guy and he was like where is my bread, where is my wine.  Pretty much everything I said, I would reply along the lines that we do it better than anyone else back  in America.  I came to the conclusion that I most likely won't pick up on much "Dutch, but improve my Spanish.  I constantly try to use it when talking to people from Spanish speaking countries.    A marketing major, a possible position is that of a brand manager.  In doing so you usually try to create a brand through the use of media among other means.  In practice I understand how it works, but my personal opinion was that it doesn't work.  I was talking to a Dutch girl who was telling me where she was thinking about studying abroad.  She mentioned a few including Canada, but no America.  I told her that Canada is nice and in ways very similar to the US.  She said she wants to see America, but doesn't want to live there for the people.  She said she understands there are geniunely nice people, but as a whole it is something our country lacks.  I asked her how she came to this conclusion and the reply was movies and TV.  Maybe we do need to become a little more aware of what we do broadcast.  First thing that crossed my mind was kids and violence on TV.    Anyways  a lot of people over here don't like America.  I picked up some postcards I felt were interesting.  One was the US flag in the shape of Pac Man eating drops of oil and leaving behind white crosses.  Made me think.

      So Todd and I were talking about the Counting Crows the other night.    We were planning on seeing them perform in Amsterdam, but the show has already happened.  Anyways he was saying how he heard them this past summer in Bryant Park up in NYC.  I was there that same morning.  It just amuses me that we were at the same place same time and meet across the Atlantic.  We were saying probably one of us stepped on each other's shoes and was like who is that ass.  The only other big news is I get a tax return so I then get a gym membership.  It feels great to be doing something physically active besides walking everywhere.  The facility can't be any bigger than one back in highschool, but it has the basics which is all you really need.  What I found funny is that while I'm probably lifting the same amount it seems less because of kilograms.  There is 2.2 pounds or so per kilo.  So I can't put 45s one or I'd kill myself, and that just wouldn't be good.  Also a discovery I made, but wish I knew about earlier.... they don't even have water fountains at the gym.  So I figure I could come to over here and make some money as either a) Culligan man or b)Open up a Starbucks.  Now I wouldn't choose the later unless other American companies have staked a claim.  Since America is a very capitalistic, money hungry country I don't have to worry for several fastfood establishments are already in place.

      Last night, I was actually caught up with everything which was nice.  My roommate and I decided to have a game of chess.  He'd take several minutes between each move, I'd take several seconds.  Anyways I was thinking him being Polish would beat me, but alas it was I who got to say check mate.  It's funny, back home I'm called Grandpa for going to bed so early.  Well Matche does too so it's'a good fit.  It's fun lying in bed and talking to each other about what is going on in the world and learning of each others cultures.  He has told me I don't fit many American stereotypes.  I was curious and he was like you don't work all the time and you aren't fat.  I'll take it as a compliement.                             This week we are suppose to hopefully meet up with our client to discuss exactly what research they would like us to.  The joys of free labor.  Random side note, I found a place that serves the best Gyro sandwiches ever.

      Friday I received a knock on the door from a potential new roommate.  Ron from Germany.  I had been wanting to switch rooms, because mine isn't in the best shape and I really wanted an Internet connection.  I told him that I'd like to move in, so I walked down to the reception to notify the Guesthouse.  It is on this walk that I realize my reasons for moving are ridicolous.  If I had free time, instead of seeing Maastricht, I'd be on the web.  I decided that the view from my room is more than enough to have me stay put.  Also its cheaper, and compared to the other students attending here I fill that void of broke college student.  Also Matche, my Polish roommate is just too good of a guy to leave.  So this weekend I made it to Amsterdam.  I wish I could say it was a much needed break, but it actually turned out to almost be the opposite.  I took the train with several friends to meet up with several more who had arrived earlier.  Who were the loudest people on the train?   My friends.  I feel like we need to respect their culture, and I wondered if my friends feel the same.  At the same time, it seems like all anyone wants to do is talk about partying or talk about the parties back home.  Don't'get me wrong, by no means have I never been drunk or have gone out or shared stories of such occurances.  I'm 22, it's happened and will happen in the future.   It's just for me I feel there is more you can talk about.  I want to get to know these people I've met.  I want them to tell me a story of their past.  I want to know what they crave and dream for.  Not like this one time I was so wasted.....  I'm in Europe to see the culture.  I want to experience a place different from where I come from.   The group I was with had a hard time deciding what to do that night.  I was perfectly content walking around and just taking it all in.  After much bickering(spelling???) the group finally split up.  On this trip I've now taken the role of the decisive one for standing in one spot has grown old.  Anyways I told the group that everything will be ok if we split up.  Go do what you want, but I'm going to check out the sights.  Some decided to join me and luckily they did.  We stumbled across this little hole in the wall jazz joint.  It was perfect and ddn't back to the pot smelling hostel till 4 in the morning.  The next morning we made it to than Van Gogh museum and the Heinken brewery museum.  Both interesting, one I appreciated a little bit more than the other.  At the Heinken place they have two bars on the tour, where you get a free drink.  Everyone was wondering if there was something wrong when I didn't drink.  I wondered the same thing.  Is someone so insecure with themself that they have to drink when they are at a bar.  I know I can say this outright when several have told me they don't like beer.  I also met some people from Syracuse who were studying in London at the time.  One of them was eating a brownie and couldn't stop laughing.  I think the "coffee shops"' make more off American tourists than the Dutch.    That night a small group of us decided to go back to Maastricht so we could study today.

      Well, its still really cold, really wet, and cloudy.  I've seen the sun for probably about 10 minutes my entire time here.  Also ever since I went sledding at A&M which was about two weeks ago I'v had a nasty cold.  Every time I cough(so about every ten minutes), I feel as if I'm going to lose a lung.  My Polish rooommate gave me some medicine.  Don't really know what it was because it was well...in Polish.  It didn't hurt, but it didn't help.  I think warm weather will be my only cure.  One good thing about the cold is that it can be used as a refrigator.  There are about 10 people on my floor and only two microfridges.  Since they are just packed I put my stuff on the balcony, it's kind of convient like that.  So I finally experienced what the other exchange students have been talking about.  It's called Aldi.  It's just a very cheap grocery store.  Basically you go in there and try to move groceries so you can have a box to put your items in.   The quality isn't the greatest, but when you can fill up a box for 12 euros you can't really complain.  Another thing I find funny about groceries is they don't have the heatlh information on the package.  Then you look around and realize Europeans are skinnier than Americans.    Last night I experienced washing clothes here.  It's about 3 euros a load, which is kind of expensive.  At least they could have put some instructions in English....ignorant American I know.   Anyways I figured it out....about 40 minutes later I wondered why it hadn't stopped.  I decided just to stop it myself.  The dryers were the same way...they kept going and going.  I talked to the RA person and she was like sometimes they take awhile, sometimes they don't.  So I guess it's different every time.  So in line with washing clothes, the Peru guy n my floor came up to me and asked if I knew how to wash clothes.  I said yes, and he was excited for he doesn't know how to do anything.  He is use to a servant.  He has never cooked anything, washed anything, or cleaned anything.  He said he was really worried about the vacuum.  I assured him it wouldn't bad and would show him how to work one.  Plus about Maastricht, waffles on the street.  They are warm and good.  Like a big cookie.  These will become my hot dog of the Netherlands.  Negative about Maastricht.  2 dollar euro coins.  You got to be careful if you drop coins or you could lose a lot of money, not a lot but I'm just broke.    Classes are still a pain, but are getting a bit better.  Well not really, I've just accepted the fact and am dealing with it.  We introduced ourselves in project management the other day.  I'm the youngest one with several students in their late 20's pursuing their MBA.  So I must be one smart SOB.  One last funny story, we were talking over dinner just about anything.  I was like last night I had a dream I was at my old job just working, doing nothing in particular.  This girl was like isn't it funny, you wake up and you'r in Europe.  Is it not usually the other way around.  To end it, I'll leave you with the tip of the week:  If you have to buy a phone card, go to an Asian store.  It's a little known fact a guy from Hong Kong told me.   I got a 2 hour plus card to call just the US for 4 cents a minute.

      So things just seem to get worse.  Just when you think you have everything in order, sometime life throws you a curve ball.  Today I got an email from a professor switching my tutorial group to a half hour later.  Well it just so happens as now this class ends, a 10 minute walk or so in town my other class has begun.  I don't see how it is fair and in all honesty I don't care for this school right now.  I've emailed the professor trying to figure out what can be done, but in a rude reply received well basically said sorry, but you can always leave early because i can't stop you.  Basically saying if you do this, it'll effect your grade.  It's more frustrating when I already had to change a course time to fit with the class.  Only for it to change again.  My only possible solution might be for me to drop a course.   I'm still trying to work around this.  If I do this, my summer plans will change and I will need to go back to Texas and take summer school so that I can still graduate on time.  While I did come over here for an education, I didn't come over here to be swamped with work.  I've been told that A&M programs are easy and I wish I had found one to fit with my major.  Challenges are great, but I just don't want one this time around.  Still there are some things that are enjoyable being here.  My polish roommate likes to drink vodka and I just get a kick out of it.  For me, its like the stereotypical Polish boy.  However last night he was drinking Smirnoff Ice, which while good, isn't a "'man's"  drink.  Also there is a guy from NYU, I like to hang out with.  We both are able to joke around with each other, which is good because neither one of us is really happy about how the academics are here.  They had this beginning of the term party last night and there were over a thousand people or so.  We just got a kick out of how europeans dance and acted.  I'm sure they got a kick out of us.  Also I've realized there are small things that are great.  Waking up to an incredible view, even though I'm wishing my alarm wasn't buzzing.  Or putting my towel on the bathrooms water heater so when I get out of the shower its really warm.  Then coming to the library every day and passing the building for music education and hearing all the insturments.  I also get a kick of how I don't know how somethings work because directions are in dutch.  Today for example I screwed up some copies.  Also another perfect example was setting up my bank account yesterday.  Everything went fine, but signing the contract I wondered if they could put in a clause.  Saying if you close this when you leave we'll charge you a 1000 bucks.  While I'm sure this isn't the case it makes me wonder what the terms were.  I'll be fine for I haven't even had to put in money into it yet.

      Let's title this entry What the Hell have I gotten myself into.  Today was the first day of classes here in Maastricht.  Put it this way, if I was at A&M I would be going through Bonfire trying to find something else.  My culture class which I thought was suppose to be easy recommends 20 hours a week to study for.  The syllabuses here are about 20-30 pages.  While I'm sure it'll get better as time goes on, it does seem frightening.  The class consists of two tutorial and one lecture.  I just found out the lecture is across the river so that is about a 40 minute walk from my dorm.  Safe to say I'll be bike shopping soon.  In the tutorials the groups are small and in fact a couple times I will be asked to lead the group in discussion for the two hours.  Should be interesting.  Next class is project management.  We are actually given a project with real companies that are interested in seeing how their problem can be solved.  Seeing if younger people see an alternate route.  We will be using software and the list of journal readings assigned is 3 pages.  We  will be keeping a project journal and a presentation of 25 minutes.  Now I hate getting up and talking, and so far in college it hasn't gone much over 5 minutes.  I guess I need to improve real quick.  Oh I forgot to mention the average age of students in my classes are mid twenties.  Somewhere along the line I didn't get the memo that I am going to what is equilavent to grad school courses.  Sitting in the classroom made this a quick and honestly somewhat painful reality.  Let me add these are considered intermeidate classes as where as next block I have signed up for advanced.  It also surprises me that going through the halls I don't hear English.  Since the business school is all taught in English I thought people would use it to become more familiar.  I guess not.    Now in all honesty I do believe I will be able to succeed at these courses.  I think the knowledge and experiences gained will helpful.  But there is part of me that was wanting Maastricht to be just a fun time.  An opportunity to travel and see the world.  This will likely happen only on breaks.    Yesterday I went withsome people to a casino in a town about 10 minutes away or so.  It was fun, and all I lost was 2 bucks.  I knew if I put in more I would just come out empty handed.  One guy lost 90.  Stupid American.  I've also realized now what I miss most about the US.  Water.  Free water.  Since I don't drink cokes it's been hard for me to find this drink that seems so rare here.  In no building do they have water fountains.  In no restaraunts do they use their tap to give you a glass.  Instead make you purchase bottled water.   I had heard of this before I coming over, but I guess to the extent it does surprise me.  A couple times at vending machines I thought I purchased juice only to find it be carbonated juice.  I hope to get the hang of it soon enough for carbonated ice tea was pretty horrible.  That is all that has happened.  This town is beautiful and very lively in the town squares.  I can only imagine how it'll be when the sun is out and I know my way around(hopefully this part will come soon)

      I haven't been here long and yet it seems like a lot has already happened.  I tried to set up a bank account, but got this huge run around from them telling me to go to tax office who told me to go the police office.  I found out there's a better bank to go to.  Grocery store, that was another interesting thing.  First off, I don't know Dutch so I'm very skeptical of what I buy.  I ended up with a yogurt milk for one thing.  I was just hoping it'd be skim or 1%.  Checking out was another issue all in its self.  I didn't know you had to weigh the fruit before hand.  She was like you didn't weigh these and I was like you're right I didn't'.  Also you have to pay for bags and sack your own.  The people behind me didn't seem to enthused.  Also eating out much like the grocery store is confusing.  Somethings I can recognize others I can't'.  I've now and then just pointed to something and pressed my luck kind of thing.   No complaints so far.    Since it is the Netherlands, I'v allready been to my first "coffee shop" I actually didn't smoke at all, but the people I were with did.  Its about 3 bucks for a joint which I guess is pretty cheap.  I had a milk shake instead that was really good.  Last night I took part in an activity called Dutch Cantus.  Basically you drink a lot of beer and then sing.  But you aren't allowed to drink during songs.  Oh and the songs were good ones like summer of 69 and Wake me up before you go go and the such.  If you broke a rule, and there were several they would make you get on stage and do something embarrsing and that dealt with drinking.  Like from a wooden shoe or a dirty sock.  It just got crazy and was something funny to take in.  Since its not a campus and the streets go every which way I still don't know where one of my classes is.  I was going to do that today, but in a little bit I'm catching a ride on a train and going to a casino in a nearby town.  All part of the introduction week.  Oh I also now have a roommate from Poland. He seems to be a very nice guy.  He also seems really smart and I knows about 4 languages quite well.  It's a talent I wish I had.  Classes start tomorrow something I'm not looking all that forward to.  I keep hearing horrible stories.  Basically your grade is based on a participation, paper or presentation, and one final exam.  If you fail the exam you fail the class and I''ve heard about 40% fail classes.  Sometimes it is as high as 70%.  It's suppose to be the best business school according to a Dutch study in the Netherlands....I'd rather it be easy this time around.

      Well I'm now in Holland and the journey has begun.  On Tuesday the 29th, I arrived at Hobby airport with my luggage and passport.  I really didn't have any idea of what was to come, but I knew how much I'v been wanting to go.  So I get into line and put my luggage on the weigher.  5 pounds to heavy, I put some items into my carry on so they don't charge me.  I can't believe my one suitcase alone weighs 70 pounds.  Next stop is Atlanta, switch terminals and wait just a bit.  I'm crossing the ocean and watching the movie Simon, which isn't all that great.  I finally give up and try to get some sleep.  After a few hours they turn on the lights and give us a small breakfast.  I'm now in the Netherlands at the airport.  All my bags arrive minus a frisbee that I had attached to the outside of my packback.  The idea of luggage handlers throwing it around on the tarmac crosses my mind.  It is now my responsibiltiy to learn the trains and get to Maastricht.  All I can say is that I packed way too much.  Carrying my luggage around got real annoying.  Luckily to get around all you need to be able to do is read numbers and use a map.  A met a guy from Cuba with broken English.  We talked about Castro and how he really isn't that great for the country.  He was a fan of Bush.  The train ride was about 2 and a half hours.  I tried despartely to stay awake on it, but I drifited in and out due to jet lag.  Since Maastricht was the last stop I figured I'd be ok.   I did see some windmills though.  Arriving at the train station, ESN (People who help the exchange students checked me in).  It was a short a van ride to the Guesthouse, where we checked in for rooms.  I had now met several people who all seemed friendly.  I was sent into the other dorm.  The other dorm hasn't'been remodeled, and compared to the other ones is quite crappy.  However it is the tallest dorm, and since I''m on the 9th floor I have an incredible view of Maastricht.  Without a TV it's something to look at while eating corn flakes in the morning.  They gave us a short city tour that night and ended it with dinner at a pub.  They then decided to have a beer drinking relay.  The ones who had arrived today were tired and Americans.  We didn't'want to do it at all.  But after being called American Pussies, by the Europeans we decided to be a sport and have a round of it.  4 races later and losing every race, made wish I didn't participate in this event.  Safe to say, I fell asleep easily that night.  The next day I went around with some people to see the town I'll be staying in.  I woke up to a blizzard.  Anyways we walked around saw the town squares, small winding roads, and  quaint shops.  We also saw there equivalent of red light district we a couple of sex shops and "'coffee shops."'  That night the planned activity was a pub crawl.  We went to six different pubs and had at least one drink at each one.  It seems Europeans really love 80's'music.  Also at the last pub, you had to pay to use the bathroom.  I was a little annoyend with this, but accepted it.  However I was really mad when a bouncer stopped me from leaving.  Apparantely you have to pay to leave.  A cover charge wold have been fine, but to pay to leave is just crazy.  More has happened, but I need to take care of some business.  I have overlapping classes somehow, something I had securely prevented before leaving.  School starts Monday and I'm anticipating a frustrating week.

      Like the Robert Frost poem, I tookk path less traveled adn that made all the difference.  So yesterday I decided to take a different path back from the library.  There is this city wall, but with an opening close to the library.  I figured I had a good enough sense of direction that I could go throught it and eventually find a path back to the dorm.  It was almost amazing.  On the other side of this wall there was a creek with ducks, a small zoo (saw some deer and other birds).  The bike path follows this creek through a park.  Very picturesque and is not much of a detour at all.  It made my day.

      So I made an interesting discovery this week.  There is no midnight in Europe.  Europe uses military time, something that took me a little bit of time to get use to. So back to this whole midnight thing.  Clock ticks.....23:58...23:59...0:00.  At that moment I thought for a moment that time does not exist.  Now there is no parallel universe that forms, but it really just doesn't look right when you are staring at those red LED lights.  I was talking to my roommate, and I was like we should go crazy right now, put cooking pots on our head and bang pans with wooden spoons and go up and down the halls.  All the while yelling of course.  This wasn't the first time such thoughts had gone through our heads.  A couple weeks back the power went out and we didn't know what to do.  I would have been an interesting character in the Lord of the Flies  Last night had a French girl cook us a 4 course meal.  It was good.  I think I am going to start cooking more when I get back to Texas.  I really should find a cooking for singles/bachelors course because I'll be on my own before I know it.  If anyone knows of such a thing offered at A&M let me know.  Since I leave on a trip sometime next week I decided to find some books for the train.  I found this cool bookstore that had a lot of used paperbacks in English.  They were listed by author, and since I dont know that many authors I would mainly look at the cover, if it interested me I'd read the back of the cover.  Bestsellers, Pultzer prize winners are a plus too.  What else...I dont know if I ever mentioned it in the journal, but there is this dead bird still stuck between a wall and carving at a church.  I don't really know how it got there.  Its a pretty big church, but then there it is.  Kind of disturbing and I see it almost everyday.  So the big news of the week.  Right before I could drop my class, I went ahead and did so.  I used a Q drop, my first.  While doing so is very Aggie of me, one of my goals was to go through A&M without using one.  Our group was never that effective from the beginning, I wish that wasn't the case.  Part of me even has the desire to retake the class so that I can learn from my failure.  Part of me never wants to work with a group of Dutch students again.  I guess I have that hard working American ethic.  So if I do have any more projects hopefully I will be with a group of Germans.  Anyways I talked to my professor and he had no words of encouragement.  Basically he had no words, wasn't a help at all.  Oh wait, just like all faculty and employees here in lovely Maastricht no help.  I know I'm being negative, but it is meant to be taken light heartedly.  You become accustomed to what you are use to, and I'm use to A&M.  However I have adapted I guess you could say.  I am working on my final now for the other class.  It is two essays.  You have to cite sources and so on.  Funny, 3 and a half years as a Business major at A&M haven't written a paper.  So this should be some good practice.  Library is closing and I wish I had access to the computer for longer.  Its hard to do these papers without them.  Youd think during finals they would extend the hours.  Nope, library open only 7 hours a day on the weekend, and closes at 10 at night on the weekday.

      I've started to realize my online journal entries aren't as regular as they once were.  This should be taken as a good sign for I guess it means I'm busy and have other things to do.  Still everday here is amazing in it's own little way.  Everyday I learn something, experience something new, am in a situation where I can't help but smile, and go through a range of emotions.  In the two months I've been here I have learned so much about myself, others, and how I view both of them.    Side note...I voted today online for A&M positions.  Funny, I vote for people who might make a slight difference at our school, but have never voted in a state or national election.  All honesty, a pretty sad statement.  It is a privledge to vote, and one in which Im very grateful of.  I need to change my actions.

      I was planning on writing about nice the weather has been, sunny, temps in the 60's', but then today its sort of the opposite.  Somewhat cold, cloudy, and will probably rain.  Still, playing outside has been nice.  I have finally started to cook a bit more in Guesthouse.  What use to be a staple diet of sandwiches(PB&J and Grilled ham and cheese) has now changed.  Yesterday I went grocery shopping and bought chicken, pasta, a lot of vegetables, eggs, and yes some sandwich bread.  A change none the less.  Another complaint about Europe; the 1 and 2 euo coins.  For some reason, probably due to the fact I've become accustomed to 1 dollar bills I despise these coins.  Since I hate having change in my pocket I always spend them rather quickly.  Whats worse is yestderday they were out of these coins at the cash register.  So I got about 5 euros worth of coins in 20 cent and 50 cent pieces....great.  After I bagged my groceries (another complaint) its back to the Guesthouse.  Grocery shoping becomes a workout all together.  I have my backpacked filled with groceries and then two plastic bags(heavy duty ones I might add) in each hand.  By the time I'm in my room after the 10-15 minute walk back, all blood is drained from my fingers as they are as white as can be.  The only other thing I can think to talk about is fear.  Lately a lot of people have become worried about traveling here in Europe.  Now I do understand that there is conflict in the world, but I do not see a direct threat where we are at.  I honestly believe that if you start changing your daily  habits, your routine, then the opponent has one.  You can not let fear control your actions.  My one roommate is heading back to New York after this first block, but hasn't booked his ticket yet because of concerns of the war.  He has a better chance of getting into an accident taking the taxi home from the airport than he does on the flight.  You have to live life the way you want to live it.  Not the way others want you to live.  Oh, my project management groups is worthless.  There are a few guys who have missed more class than  have attended.  Once I meet up with the professor this week (this is if I can, with him not having office hours of any sorts) I will probably drop the class.

      It's Saturday and I'm not traveling.  This is a first.  Finals are about to begin so I have decided to just take it easy this weekend and stay in Maastricht.  Who knows maybe I will go for a bike ride and try to become more acquainted with the area.  In parts I still don't have a clue where I am going.  Not much else is really new here.    Last night my roommate and I had a French girl cook us dinner.  It was a good time.  She taught us on how to taste wine, what to look for, etc.  We had a bottle of South African wine, and she thought it wasn't too bad, but was skeptical at first.  It was fun to have her over because even though we know how her country views the war we were able to joke about  it.  Talked about Freedom Fries, and she made fun of our fast paced way of life.  Living in this international dorm really gives me hope about the world in the future.  Here we are confined to a few hallways and yet many ethnic groups are not only to tolerate, but enjoy ones company.    The only other story is that I went to a Pimp and Hoes party at a local club.  I honestly think this club has some of the worst music, and its American music.  The songs aren't that great for dancing.  Anyways I found it hard to dress like a pimp,  I guess I left those clothes back home.  However some people obvisiouly packed them.  It was a funny sight.

      Weekend Update.  Friday, a friend and I decided to take a day trip to Bruge, Belgium.  Nothing is really all that special there, its just your typical quaint town.  Picturesque kind of thing.  Took some photos, saw some old churches, climbed a tower, and then headed home.  While I was there, I finally purchased some Belgium chocolate.  It is good, but now and then  a Snickers really hits the spot.  The next day morning I left for Germany.  Frankfurt to be exact.  I was to meet up with an old friend, one I hadn't seen in over a year.  They were to meet me at the train station.  They figured I could get there by noon, but being on the budge I am I usually avoid the fast trains because of the extra cost.  So I left the Guesthouse around 1 and probably got in around 1:15ish.  This was the same time they decided to leave the meeting place.  One quick note, the train ride from Cologne, Germany to Mainz was incredible.  It's very hilly and follows the Rhine river.  I saw castles, now how exciting is that.    So Im trying to get a hold of Kathy using her cell phone, but I have no luck.  I would later find out that when in Germany and calling a cell phone you have to add a zero before one of the series of numbers.  I decide to head to the hotel.  I make it there after much confusion.  I had to take some local trains and one was under construction.  So when it started going the opposite way at one of the stops I became much confused.  So I went up to this guy and did the whole American thing of saying Spechlizine zee English, or something along those lines.  Turns out it was very fluent and helped me quite a bit.  Once Im at the hotel I am finally able to reach her on the cell phone and we meet up at the train station.  It ended up being a quite  a long day.  The next day we rented a car and followed some Germans that my friends mom knew.  I realized it was my first time to ride in a  car since I've been here.  Again, the country side was amazing.  However I enjoyed catching up with my friend more than anyting else.  The next moring I woke up at 5:30 so I could make it back to Maastricht.  I didn't get in till slightly after 1.  I should just pay for the faster trains.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to watch Bush's speech last night, because of the whole time difference.  It looks like war is going to happen and I wish it wasn't.  Now I realize I don't have all the information and that it is best to put my trust in our government, yet it seems so hard to do.  Innoncent lives will be lost.  There is no need for that.  I find it funny that before Bush became president the only country he had ever been to was Mexico.  Maybe if he saw the world he would realize we are all the same he would think about the consequences of war a bit more.  We all have hopes, fears, and go through emotions.  Sure on the outside we may look differnet and speak a different language, but we are all humans.  I kind of wish Bush would head over to Iraq and see what he is about to destroy.  Don't get me wrong, I realize Saddam is not the best leader.  I know he has committed genocide.  I wish we could snipe the guy.  However you have to sit down and ask yourself why Iraq.  I know for a fact there are leaders in Africa who violate human rights.  We don't go after these, maybe if they had oil we would.    So even though war is going to happen, I hope its well planned out and citizen deaths are kept to a minimal.  No family deserves to break up, no kid deserves not to grow up without a mom or dad taken away by war.

      I am here in the library, writing a paper on my favorite song and how it applies to my identity.  Basically it''ll just be a lot of bullshit.  I have chosen a song by Jackopierce and have included some general background information.  Well the group is back together and will be perfroming in College Station in a week or so.  I wish I was there for that.

      3 flights, 13 trains, 8 bus rides(including a double decker tour of London), and utlizing 2 city subways my journey comes to an end.  So Saturday morning I woke up in the hostel, left my pack in a closet and did some more exploring.  The weather was great and I was able to see a few more sights.  Then it was off to London.    London, dont know really what to say about it.  I didn't see much of it.  However I was able to stay with some A&M friends and it was truly great to hang out with some people from back home.  I got in Saturday night and my friends were all jet lagged.  I didn't care to do anything else for I was just tired of all the traveling.  However I did have some KFC and that was nice.  The next morning we woke up, checked out a couple markets and did some exploring.  That afternoon we took one of those double decker bus tours.  It was a good way for me to see the major sites.  Pretty much took photos, for not much was open on a Sunday.  However the Tower of London was.  It has ravens, those big black birds.  Ugly, straight out of Edgar Allen Poe's poem.  Anyways they have clipped wings, because it is rumored if they were to ever leave London the city would fall.  I wanted to take a picture next to one.  So I lean up against this pole.  Not too close to the bird.  Well it walks over.  Im thinking, oh it knows how to pose.  No, it knows how to bite.  It bit my arm.  The next thing I could think of was my eyes are going to be pecked.  So I got out of there.  That night we ate the Hard Rock Cafe.  Its the original so that is nice.  Our waitress honestly vanished, so that wasn't nice.  The next morning I woke up and made it back to the airport and eventurally after some trains and buses back to Maastricht.  Did some laundry and studying and called it a night.

      Forgot three things 1.  I love Gelatto.  Pretty much ice cream, yet different. 2.  I'm tired of pizza and pasta.  I did the McDonalds thing today 3.  I haven't been pick pocketed yet.  Talking to other traverles it sounds really common over here.  All I'll have for them is a fist in their face.

      Whirlwind Italy trip update.  Last Saturday, March 1st I believe, Todd and I began our adventure.  An adventure it has been.  It was Carnaval break in the Netherlands and we were out of there.  We were to catch our flight the next day out of a small airport by Brussells.  Armed with a few maps and my good sense of direction, at least I think its good we left.  We had our backpacks on and money or I should say euros in our pockets. Bus to train station.  Train to Leige, Belgium.  Switch trains, now to Brussells.  I've heard there wasn't much in Brussles, but the town square is nice.  Well it took us a while to find.  Basically we were loss for 2 hours or so.  Now dont get me wrong, even though I am a guy, I'm willing to ask for directions.  We were given wrong ones.  Anyways we found the square and a couple of side streets that were really nice.  We ate mussells in Brussells.  Cute huh.  Ok, so its getting dark time to get going, but where you ask.  We didn't know either.  We took a train to Chariolla(spelling is wrong, but the story goes on).  From the train, took a bus to a desolate airport.  Ryan Air is the only one who uses it.  Its a cheap airline, thankfully.  Looks like we are spending the night there.  We stayed up, played some chess (Im now 2 and 1, so go me).  Got a little goofy trying to entertain ourselves in this two gate airport.  There were others spending the night, including one Italian who offered us anything he had.  Food wise.  Mister Cash( the ATM machine) the tourist brochures, and our conversations were getting dull.  Time to sleep.  Todd locked his bag to himself.  I tied knots to mine and put the shoulder straps through my legs.  No one was going to steal my stuff.  No one did, but the metal chairs that made my bed killed my back.    Next morning.  We are awake and have to wait for our flight.  The reason we wanted to be near the airport on Sunday was we didn't think we could catch our flight if we took an early train on Sunday.  Now off to Rome.  Last check in for the hostel is 2:30.  So land in the airport, find a bus to the main train station.  Hop on a subway for free.  The machines wanted exact change, something neither of us had so we followed some people right past the police.  Hey, when in Rome right.  Now we are walking trying to find the hostel.  We just couldn't.  So we get to a hotel, they call and to find out the street number I thought I had, was the city code, the place was across the street.  Drop off our stuff and go explore.  We did Rome like it was nothing.  We walked a ton.  We were like hey the colloseum, click of the cameras, hey fountains of tri veni, click again, and kept on walking.  Its hard to believe we were there.  I dont want to get into details of every day.  Overall a lot of fun.  Next morning, the Vatican.  The Sisteen chapel is nice, but you know what, so is every other ceiling in that museum/chapel.  I was amazed by the whole thing.  My favorite thing/monument/whatever though was St. Petersburg cathedral.  Amazing is how I'll sum it up.  So to be cheap we were now off to Florence to stay with Todds friends.  So back on the subway to the train station.  On a train to Florence.  Arrive in Florence at night, find the place.  Sleep.  Next day explored Florence.  Beautiful city.  Its what I picture Spain to look like.  Pastel colors and red tiled roof kind of things.  We saw a lot, held hands, ok not really, but we felt like a couple doing everything together.  Next day, saw the statue of David, the typical Florence thing.  I  snuck a picture of it, even though its banned to do.  Also took one of the sisteen, another banned place.  They were just asking for it.  Well we walked, I can't stress to you how much we have walked.  Its ridicolous.  Finally saw my first Ferrari in Italy.  Went to a peace rally too.  Italy, another country who just doesn't want war.  Can't blame them.  We didn't stick around.  The Communists flags flying grabbed my attention though.  Now its Thursday, Todd and I say our half closed eye goodbyes.  He is heading back to Netherlands later to meet his girlfriend.  I'm bumming around Italy.  Not a bad place to bum around.  I had to leave the apartment at 5:45 in the morning to catch my train to Cinque Terre.  Walking around at 5:45 in a foreign town is kind of funny.  Its dead quiet, and you know you stick out.  Still I made it.  Took a train to La Specia.  Got off and got on a train to Manarola, one of the five towns of Cinque Terre.  Its along the upper west coast of Italy.  I am thinking it might be the most beautiful part of earth I've ever seen.  I can't explain, it was just awesome seeing these houses built along cliffs along the Mediterrean.  These 5 towns are connected by walking paths.  That are over a hour and a half between each town.  I dropped off the bag at the hostel and grabbed the camera.  I saw three towns, so I was happy with myself.  The walk back was horrible.  I was just beat and all this up and down walking was killing me.  Obvisiously I made it for here I am talking about it. Spent a good 6 hours or so going up and down.  Ok, so a small world thing.  Well I thought hostels were just for young people.  Some might be, but I've seen a lot of old people.  Like families.  Anyways small world thing. I was talking to two guys in my room.  Both from Texas, and one of the guy always goes up to Billings.  He talked about the Brew Pub, and to myself I was like I've been there.  So tomorrow I head off to London to meet up with some A&M friends.  Im exicted, but realize I need to be relatively close to Rome so I dont miss my flight.  Cinque Terre is about 7 hours away.  I decided to spend a night in Rome.  I looked at a map and thought why not take a detour.  Pisa.  Well sure enough the tower leans.  Click of the camera.  Walk back to the train station.  A lot longer walk than I thought it would be.  Back on the train to Rome.  The train was packed, I was right by the bathroom, sort of between cars with a few other people.  After a few stops though, some chairs opened up.  Now trains in europe are torture.  They are nice, easy to use, and the rocking motion just makes you want to sleep, especially after you have been hiking and what not.  Well can you sleep.  Not really, because you have a good chance of getting your stuff stolen.  So I keep switching between reading and listening to music.    Arrive in Rome and go to the closet hostel that is listed in my book.  Its full, Im afraid this how it is going to be.  I like to be spontaneous and kind of find things.  Traveling europe, it really isn't the best thing to do.  They send me to the tourist office that closes in 20 minutes.  I get there, they book me a room.  That is where I am now.  Its actually an alright place for not needing a key to get in a room.  I just wish there wasn't someone in my room because I need to make my bed and repack.  I dont want to turn on the lights.  Well the weary travel is going to be awaken in about 15 minutes because I need to get some stuff done.  The plan tomorrow is to check out a few sights I still want to see and then take the bus to the airport.  Fly to London.  Sometime next week I should write part 2. I'm growing weary and am looking forward getting back to Maastricht.  Words I never thought I would really say.

      I finished a book.  High Fidelity by Nick Hornby.  I have to say I loved every bit of it.  Its one of those books that you are dissappointed when it ends.  You want more.  Getting near the end, I started to read less each night because of that fact.  I wasn't ready to finish it.  If you're a guy, read it.  You'll be able to relate to it, some will more than others.  It is very much comical.  Also with the music influence, I enjoyed it a bit more.  If you're a girl you'll enjoy the book as well.  And in the process will learn maybe a little bit more of what goes through a man's mind.

      First week of classes has ended and I'm excited.  Friday I had to do a presentation on Virgin Atlantic Airways with my small group for services marketing.  We met at 2pm the day before and worked out at 10 page paper, and a hour and a half Powerpoint slide show.  Pretty impressive.  It went well, but could have gone better if there was more interaction from the class, which it is suppose to be.  Still talking to the professor, she seemed to think it was good and wished the class would have particpated more.  She missed the first 15 minutes because of a late train.  It was pretty funny presenting when she wasn't in there because we know the audience, our class doesn't care about what we are talking about.  Due to time constraints we still had to go ahead.  Two random side notes:  I think the teacher likes me, not in that can I see you after class kind of way.  But my group noticed it too, she sort of lights up when I talk or am able to contridict a student with research findings.  I wonder how far I can go on charm alone.  The other note is Virgin Atlantic is a pretty creative airline at least if you ride first class.  They have tailors on board, massage table (with seatbelt), beauticians, and have other nice perks like serve ice cream.  They do seem to be at the forefront in terms of innovativeness.  Last night I went to a Beer Cantus, something I did back in January when I arrived.  You sing 80s songs and drink a ton of beer inbetween songs.  Theres rules too, so if you screw up you have to do something on stage.  While I didn't get sick, it is sort of ridicolous how much and how quickly you drink beer.    Dutch weather has kicked in.  Raining.  Not fun to go anywhere, yet I had to get to the library.

      I went grocery store shopping yesterday and I've pretty much have fallen into a routine.  All I eat is pasta, quesidillas, PB&Js, cereal, salad, yogurt, and fruit(this I change up).  Pretty boring, but when others cook it is always something different and usually good.  I wish I had a cook book, but then I look at everything that is packaged and usually have no idea what it is.  So  anyways my deodarant is getting low, still have a good week or so, but I figured Im at the store go ahead and pick up another stick.  Now Im hoping for an American brand, I got to aisle and now I was just hoping to find deodarant.  They had one brand and one type, a roll on.  I'm not a fan of the roll on.  I like the stick.  There's a better grocery store I'll check out.  Maybe thats why a lot of people smell, including the guy directly next to me.  Another random side thought: Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night because of a sound or something going on.  You're awake, but really at the same time are asleep.  You have no idea whats going on and it takes too much effort or time to comprehend whats going on around you.  Last night I woke up to people yelling, at around 5 am.  I think the kids from UNC were still partying.  Anyways I heard a lot of cussing and a lot of shut ups.  I think it was the Asians who were mad, because I think UNC people were being loud.  But I can't be for sure since I was in that half aware state.  Still I found it amusing.  Through the airvents you can hear conversations from throughout the hall.  I had my first day of European Community Law.  There are a ton of exchange students.  I'd say half of the 90+ students or so.  This is a huge lecture class for Maastricht, all my other classes never surpass 12.  I like the smallness because you get to know others, but then you have to be more alert and up to speed with everything which is a negative.  Anyways this class is not in the Business school, but some other building.  Well Im the first one there and take a seat. I really shouldn't even be in a seat, but a pew.  I'm inside a huge church.  Stainglass windows, 50-60 foot tall ceilings, flying buttresses, everything.  It's kind of cool, but once classes started I saw the downside you can't hear the guy too well.  His voice just carries.  Then if someone coughs or whispers, or squeaks their chair that is all you can hear.  The professor is trying to get a different lecture hall for us to use.  I hope so, because if I'm day dreaming or so I have to deal with Jesus in the stainglass window staring me down directly in front of me.  I know he's like you are sinning Dave.  Stop it Dave.  Probably not, but its amusing to think about.  So this class was kind of intense.  Not so much as outside work like my other classes just material.  Its law.  He talked pretty much two hours straight on it.  My hand still hurts.  Later we have to go buy copies of a lot of treaties and get to know them.  Article XII, in section 3 paragraph 2 states.....Looking forward to that.  There is also a book that goes along with it.  The professor said its law so its boring.  I don't expect you to be able to read more than 5 pages an hour.  I just bought the book.  The pages aren't that big, but I hope the material isn't that technical.  I can think of a lot more I'd rather do in an hour than read 5 pages.

      Friday morning, time to pick up the car.  Since we are doing this on the cheap, the four of us decide to get the smallest car possible that can fit four.  We get a Ford Fiesta, with a diseal engine....stick shift of course.  I drive it back to the dorms to pick up the other two people.  Small cars are really no fun.  I have the seat all the way pushed back and my legs are still touching the steering wheel.  Plus the stick is shaking like crazy.  Still I make it back without going down a wrong street or hitting a bicyclist.  We are off to see some famous gardens close to Amsterdam.  A half hour outside Maastricht and we hit traffic.  Like bumper to bumper traffic.  Like I want to get out of the car and walk  traffic.  We found the problem a hour later.  There was a stop light.  A STOP LIGHT on something equivalent to an interstate.  Stupid Dutch.  So we get to the park and pay for parking and the entrance fee and see some flowers.  They were pretty, I guess that is the best way to describe them.  Seeing how some people in our group felt ripped off and wanted to bring back something they decided to steal some little gnomes.  They were everywhere, 6 inches tall or so, all white little things.  I kicked one as joke and its head fell off.  Felt bad.    The garden was nice, but was more amazing were the fields before it.  Row after row of blooming flowers, mostly tulips.  Truly every color of the rainbow.  It was very much a Kodak moment.  Even have a shot of the flowers with a windmill mill in the back ground.  Cant get more Dutch than that.  We then had some dinner in Utrecht and headed on home.  We went 300 kilometers over our limit, so the rental ended up being 27 a person.  Thats close to a 120....for a FIESTA!!!  Still we had shopped around and didn't see any better rates.  Saturday I worked out and that was it.  I really have no clue what I did.  Easter Sunday went to see the Amstel Gold Bike race.  There were a ton of people and bikes down there.  Still for as big of a race as it was suppose to be(it was televised) I didn't think there were too many competitors.  Well I saw the US postal service team represtenting.  After that we went to get some coffee and hang out in one of the town's squares.  Im actually starting to like cappacinos, weird since I never like any coffee product.  It was the first Easter I didnt make it to church.  I felt kind of bad.  I even heard one of the churches ringing its bell to call mass.  Still told God hi, said a little prayer.    Monday, another big day of nothing.  It was raining and everything was closed so it was a good day to stay in.  I finished a book and am about half way done with the next.  I think in the last three weeks Ive finished 5 books, an incredible feat by my standards.  Brings us to today.  I went to an earlier section of class hoping I could switch in and kind of helping a friend who wanted my seat in the later section.  Well I got into the earlier and she wasn't allowed in the later.  Im happy I made the switch for as soon as I saw the professor one word came to mind.  American.  Bullseye, straight from the heart at Indiana.  She seems nice and easy going, I think the class will be interesting.  Since there is 11 of us, just a ton of interaction.  Shes also an interesting lady and if I had to describe her I would say she's a firecracker.  Bad news, a hour and a half presentation with paper is due this Friday.  Theres three of us and itll be nice to be the first and get it done.  We will have one more in three weeks or so.    Tomorrow will be the first day of my other class.  My friends back home finish in two weeks and I am just beginning.  Its a frustrating little thought, but then I need to realize that Im in Europe.  An opportunity that not everybody gets.

      I finally found a place here in Maastricht that plays jazz.  Now it wasn't live music, but its going to have to do.  Ok, so I had problems registering for a course back home.  I thought I could take it, found out I couldn't, tried to switch but missed my small window they gave me of 48 hours.  So I decided to go ahead and email the professor about seeing if I could get forced in.  Here's an excerpt from his reply  "I'll print your e-mail and give it to our program adminsitrator who will get you on the official roster.  Before you fully commit to the class, I do want to alert you to a slight change I'm making. because of severe budget cuts, I'm being paid about half of what I received for the same course the past 3 summers. So I will teach the class with enthusiasm, but there will be no papers, quizzes, tests, etc."  Honestly could I ask for anything better.  The professor in the rest of his email sounds interesting, the kind of guy who is really there for the students and loves the subject.  Also it was good to hear him say he will get me on the roster when I've had problems trying to get a hold of my advisor.   Well this week it looks like I might be going for a country side drive.  The tulips are in bloom and weather is beautiful. Oh I need to mention the group I'm with wants to rent a car and they can't drive stick. So it looks like I will get to do some driving.  Windows down, radio on, and Maastricht in the rear view mirror...........

      Seeing as I have absolutely nothing to really do here in Maastricht I decided to go ahead and get a jump start by reading my marketing book.  Its not that bad of an idea when I realized I have to have read all 20 chapters at then end of 6 weeks.  Not so much to read, but memorize.  Thats how exams go over here.    You don't learn much in class, more or less they want to see if you were able to understand the book completely.  So the class is services marketing and here I am in the library outlining the chapters.  It keeps on mentioning books or studies composed by a Len Berry.  This is the same professor I have heard speak to us at a Fellows meeting back at A&M.  It is the same Mr. Berry that teaches services marketing back home.  So if I didn't take the class here I could have experienced the real thing.  Then I realize I don't care all that much and just want a high grade and credit for the course.  As it gets warmer I leave my window more open.  Once again showing how the Dutch are stupid there are no bug screens.  This is not because insects don't exist.  It's my conclusion that they are cheap just like in everything they do.  It drives me crazy grocery shopping and before they leave everyone is itemizing their receipt.  Heaven forbid if its off by 23 euro cents.  Anyways I had to kill a bee in my room.    It also amuses me how I have things I could be doing.  Like writing a marketing paper for a class back home or trying to start my full time job search.  All these involve having a computer, but I can only stand being inside a library so long.  Since its also a 15-20 minute bike ride away I feel its only worth going to once.  Recommendation for those studying abroad: bring a computer.

      Well the roommate has now left for Paris and sometime early next week heads for the US.  Its funny because his school isn't too happy about him leaving the program early.  So there is a chance he might have to come back.  I'm thinking the chance is pretty slim as today I moved all the furniture and made it more comfortalbe for one person.  Now the two beds are next to each other so its like one big bed.  Living up the high life in the dorm.  Other news, did the laundry and whatever I bought did the trick.  Everything is white again.  Other good news.  Ran into an old group member from the Project Management class, i.e. the class I dropped.  I was curious to see how it turned it out and he said he didn't know.  He wasn't even there for the presentation, but decided instead to go traveling.  He said it was probably a good thing I dropped out.  I have to agree.

      After my journey, its always time to do laundry.  Now there is this one shirt I usually throw in with the colors, but since that load was full I thought why not, go ahead and throw in with the white.  This shirt is white with green sleeves, softball style.  Now I have washed this shirt many times and never once did the sleeves blead onto the shirt itself.  I was in the clear.  Not so.  After the wash I noticed everything had a slight green tinge.  Took out the shirt, washed everything again.  At 3 bucks a pop, not too happy.  Still after that wash, a green color was noticeable, even if slightly  Today, buy bleach.  I walk up and down the aisle hoping to find good ol Clorox. Not to be found, I asked a lady about bleekmiddel(bleach in Dutch).  She pointed me towards toilet bowl cleaner.  Now I am sure that there is bleach is in this cleaner, but I just don't think Toilet Duck was meant for my clothes.  I walked up the detergenant aisle a bit more until I found something meant for whites.  I hope it works.  Sad news:  My roommate leaves tomorrow for Paris and then that weekend heads home to the ol US.  He is the guy I get along the best with.  There is a chance he might come back at the end of the week.  NYU is considering putting him on academic probation for leaving the program early.  Who knows.  I guess a room to myself won't be all that bad.  More sad news.  The weather is continually warming up.  Its in the mid 70s.  Now this is usually a good thing, but it just makes me wonder how May and the beginning of June will be.  The dorm is already a bit warm, and with no AC can only get hotter.  I also think the library and Business school don't have this modern convience.  Let's hope they do.  Worst News:  Budget.  Yesterday marked the two month day.  Two months till I am in Texas.  It was also a day I was looking at my bank account and was disappointed.  I had set a limit that I didn't want to go over.  Well I am already there, and still have two months to go.  Two months is a long time.  Looking over the finances it seems most of it was spent while I was travleing. Food, hostels, and the traveling itself seems to add up relatively quickly.  It is because of this I don't see myself going anywhere this block.  Luckily I've already done a considerable amount of traveling.  However if anyone has some extra money and can throw it my way it would be greatly appreciated.  Mom, Dad, I know you are reading this...hint hint.  I'm just kidding, I should be able to manage...hopefully.

      One more thing... I lost my gloves.  These were my favorties gloves.  Grey with leather on the inside.  Putting them on always reminded me of the cold mornings in Montana starting up the ol Jeep and heading to high school.  I'm hoping someone found them in the hostel.  I don't think I left them there, but in a park in Budapest.  One more reason to not like that city.

      Budapest continued.  Half the group was there already and we were suppose to meet up with them.  We bought our strip of subway tickets(this will be important later) and headed into the direction of the hostel.  So it really wasn't a hostel, but a crappy college dorm.  No beds to sleep on, the situation was weird.  We decided to go find another place and luckily we found one.  We then went to eat because we had some time to kill.  There is a girl from Maastricht who is from Hungary and she would become our tour guide.  The food in Hungary is some of the best yet.  Flavorful and huge portions.    Anyways we met up with her and she showed us around. Saw Parliment, Budapest castle and some other sights.  I was impressed, because I was thinking if someone visited my hometown would I be able to give them a tour with a lot of interesting facts.  I really don't think so.  I was happy she came along.  Besides the sights we would see that day, I was very dissappointed in Budapest.  I thought it would be an exotic city , something more along the lines of Instanbul.  However it seemed like some streets in Philly I've seen.  Give me some cobblestone at least instead of pavement.  The next day we were to go see some country side of Hungary and go to the hometown of Katti's.  Once we met up with her there she took us around.  We saw the 4th largest catherdral in Europe.  Tbese buildings are magificient, hundreds of detailed sculptures, mosaics, paintings, gold covered, etc.  It truly is a feast to the eyes, but an ache to the heart.  Catholism, Christianity exists for the people.  If there is a god, he is a loving God, kind, and not concerned with material possesions.  A God who wants people to live a pleasant life.  The money that has gone into these churches is a complete waste.  A place to worship is different than these lavish buildings.  The surrounding town is absolutey poor.  This isn't just in Hungry, but in all the countries I'v visisted.  The church always stands out from everything else.    Now we were to go to another town.  Since we met up with her she decided all the girls should ride with her and the boys take a bus.  Thats fine.  The bus wasn't.  We all were standing up, I was pretty much on the bus drivers lap.  Eventually it started to clear out and we were able to get seats.  The bus ride was suppose to be for a hour, but we didn't know where to get off.  All the bus stops didn't have a sign.  We asked and we always got conflicting answers.  At one stop the bus driver kind of gave us the nod to get off.  Some people on the bus agreed, others didn't.  We got off, and Katti and the others were no where in sight.  I just started laughing.  I knew we would be ok, but we seriously had no idea where we were or how to get anywhere.  The situation was humoruous and the other guys agreed.    I need to make a point how there were some Koreans with us.  Their English was decent, but I taught them some things.  They never heard of a bad attitude when I told Phil he had one.  I was joking.  Well once he learned about it, he kept on telling everyone.  Now picture a Korean with an accent saying....Dave you got bad attitude, you need good attitude.  He honestly said this about every ten minutes, the frequency more than that at times.  Everytime I laughted.   So we decided to just go ahead and walk, thinking they might up the road further.  They eventually found us walking and apologized for being late.  It seems the girls went out for dessert.  This town was nice, and its here I bought a true toursit souvenier.  Postcards.  So I bought a few of those, but I bought something else.  A huge hand carved chess set, each side over 2 feet long.   It looks really nice, and it was something I wanted to buy in Czec, but thought them to be too expensive.  Well in all honesty this one wasn't cheap.  After the conversion it came to over 120 euros, which is pretty much on par with the dollar.  Well I bargained for over 30 minutes and go it for around 65.  It'll be a conversation piece when I have a place of my own.  Which really isn't that far down the road.    Back to Budapest.  Well I am now heading back to the hostel and using the subways.  I bought a strip of 20 rides, but split with another guy.  I was going through these strips fast, but I noticed you didn't have to validate them.  There was no turnstyle(probably wrong word) to prevent you from entering without a ticket.  So half the time I didn't validate them.  I noticed now and then they had guards waiting at the top of the escelators to check tickets.  I risked it enough times that I got caught this one night.  I figured play the dumb tourist.  Show them my validated tickts, saying I must have dropped one and could I just give them a new ticket.  She basically kept pointing to the fine and said sorry sir.  I honestly feel I could have said my name is Bobo, I am monkey and I eat bananas for every meal.  She would have replied with the same answer.  I payed the hefty fine of 6 euros.  Not that bad at all.    Budapest is known for their thermal baths.  We decided to go to one.  Everyone was excited, but I had an idea of what it would be like.  Supposedly we went to the most famous one there.  The water was warm, but it was all indoors I felt like I couldn't breath right.  Also the secenary of old fat guys wasn't that appealing.  But hey, Im sure there are some people out there into that.  We stayed for a hour and left.  I walked around a bit more with some others, I then decided to go ahead and make my way back to Maastricht.  I knew it would be a long travel on the rails.    I have a few subway tickets left and so I did validate them every time.  On the last subway, who should be waiting at top with thoughts of ruining peoples days, but the Metro guards.  I proudly showed them my ticket, and was soon told to move to the side.  The dialogue was pretty much this:  sir, ticket, es no good.   sir pay.  ticket, es no good.  I was nice saying what do you mean I validated, etc.  Group ticket, no good.  My blood came to a quick boil.  I hated Budapest all the more.  The conversation went on for 15 minutes.  I lied and lied.  I told them I didn't have money.  She pointed to an ATM.  Said I don't have one.  I was like you can have all my change.  Shes like passport sir.  I was like I dont have it.  All lies.  I was like I want to talk to someone else.  The guy's English was limited as well.  Basically this is why it didn''t work.  I bought a group of tickets and you are suppose to keep them all together in the bounded strip they came in and not separate them.  This is written in fine print in English on the back.  What the hell.  How the hell was I suppose to know that the back of the tickets had instructions.  Well they had been separated since the first day.  Seeing this wasn't going anywhere so I decided to made a run for it...only in my mind.  I gave in and was like wow I found some money in my pocket here you go BITCH....in my mind as well  I took the train to Vienna, and this was the first time I felt truly uncomfortable with my surroundings.  I came out of the train and tried to figure out what train I had to take next.  Whats nice, in Western Europe you can go to informatoin and they will print out a schedule showing times and places of arrival and departure, what platform etc.  Budapest didn't have this, they didn't have computers.  I knew I needed to get to Vienna and then find a train to Germany.  So here I am in Vienna at night, it wasnt barren, but not busy at all because night trains don't come too often.  I was looking up at the signs.  The one where numbers flip(for some reason I always love watching them flip).  Then went to the info desk, which because at night was closed.   Then I spotted them, two guys.  I'll call them Simon and Garfunkle.  Simon was the shorter of the two with dark hair and the one that did the talking.  The other one was taller, with frizzy hair and was quiet.  He looked a little scary.  I could tell they were talking about me as soon as I saw Simon point me out to Garfunkle.  I was like this is going to be interesting.  I turned around and headed to where there were some people sitting.  Just try and do something in front of a group.  Still they were right behind me and wanted to talk.  Here's pretty much the conversation...whats in bold is what they said.  can we help you  No Im fine  You looked lost  Well I figured it out, thanks  Whats your name  Dave  Where you from  Canada....Vancouver  Well we want to talk to you about god and Jesus....do you believe  (Now usually I will tell people my doubts and belief, but this time around I was going to agree with everything they said.) Yes I believe  What does he mean to you  He died for our sins, we should live a good life, etc(I use this word a lot dont I).  What else  (Now in my mind I was like this is not the reason they want to talk to me.  My eyes were firm, my face expressionless, but inside my pulse was rapidly increasing.  These people might have met no harm, but this night I was not going to be the naive kid I usually am.) Im done talking to you  Why, I want to know more about yoru thoughts  Well I really am done talking to you, have a good night  Please, talk to us, I want to learn more  (With heart thumping in my chest, my tone turned to anger, while fear was inside.  I kept glancing from behind to see if someone was trying to get into my pack, to see if there were trying to distract me from a third member...even though I padlocked the top zipper.  Garfunkle's glaring eyes werent helping the situation yet.  He hadn't said anyting yet.) Listen, I dont want to talk to you anymore, bye (Not once was did I lose solid eye contact with these guys.  If something was to happen I was ready to start throwing fists.  Now let me emphasize these people might have been ok guys.  Its just I dont want to be talked to by random people on a random night in a random country, all alone  Im sorry, I just really want to talk.   I want to understand  (They weren't leaving, and the adreneline was throwing through my veins with my blood.  I decided to draw the line this moment.  With voice raised, and my eyes full of fire and narrowed on Simons beady browns. Leave me the FUCK alone.   They turned around and walked away, glancing back occasionally.  I hadn't hadn't moved yet and kept staring in their direction so when they did glance back, I was right there.  Laughter broke out next to me...a welcome relieft.  Two college kids...what the fuck was that about they were asking.  We did the introduction game.  They were two kids from VMI who were just about to jump in until I yelled at ol Simon and Garfunkle.    That is pretty much the end of my adventure.  In the next 16 hours I would be riding trains, switching 6 times.  Returning to good ol Maastricht.

      This should be a long post.  Read only if you care to.  I actually don't expect anyone to really enjoy these entries, as I do not plan on reading them until I grow old.  I feel when I am in the 70's with graying hair(that is if I have hair) I will look back and see the world I did when I was 22.  I wonder if I will view it the same.  Long trains, short trains, day trains night trains, taxis, trams, chairlifts, subways, and busses.  This is my journey of the past 10 days filled with sights, stories, and small things that interetested me.  I long for a computer in my dorm room.  While it is good to go outside, I miss the comfort of TV or music on and being able to hop on the internet to surf or email.  I haven't used IM for more than 10 minutes since I've been here and that was early February.  So here I am now at library.  I must say it always feels good coming back to Maastricht.  Especially this time around.  I have been on trains straight for the last 22 hours.  Clean shaven, nails clipped, and smelling like a soap I try not to smile as my lips are chapped and crack.  Its hard not to.  Wednesday the 2nd, head to Innsbruck, Austria alone(I would meet up with friends in the Czek later).  I was taking a night train through Germany.  I met a guy from California.  We talked awhile, but he departed in Cologne, spelled Koln in Germany(I wonder who decided to change spellings for the English).  So now I am in this small car, that during the day would hold 6 passengers on a busy trip.  The car is empty and I prepare myself for sleep.  Sleep did not come over me quick and swiftly as  it usually does.  I stared at the small door and the curtain drawn over it with open eyes.  I heard foot steps and watched as shadows danced in front of me.  A ballet of sorts I didn't care to see.  Images in my head appeared.  Usually with a guy and a knife.  Images associated from Hollywood and the like.  I feel asleep eventually and would be awoken by 3 Swiss boys in their mid teens.  They were going all the way to Munich, the same station where I was to switch trains.  I no longer could lie down, but would hope they would go to sleep.  Quite the opposite.  They decided to take bottles out of their pack and drink.  One passed out and had a hard time waking up.  That Thursday I got into Innsbruck.  I wanted to just drop my stuff off at the hostel.  Actually I wanted to take a nap but wouldn't be allowed to check in till 5pm.  I followed the directions I was given.  But when I was to switch busses the one I needed was not on the street it was suppose to be on.  Armed with a map, I found my way.  So that day I walked around Innsbruck.  I would have liked to have seen the mountains, but it was cloudy in the higher elevations.  With nothing to see, I walked around aimlessly for over 8 hours.  A hightlight was going to McDonalds and just sitting down and reading a book.  It was a way for me to get out of the rain.  Next morning I went skiing.  I went to the nicer mountain and the snow couldn't have been better.  Tons of fluff, sometimes as deep as my knees.  I rented gear including gloves and pants, but they did not have goggles or sun glasses to borrow.  I damaged my eyes to say the least.  I don't know why they were blood shot.  Poor visibility, staring at white all day, snow and ice hitting them, or the occasional sun.    All I can is that they were red.  Eventually they cleared up.  Still I can now say I skiied the alps.  One more thing on my life long list I can check off.  A few others include owning a convertible, sky diving, and having a family.  The next day I was to meet up with my friends at 7 in Prague.  The earliest I could get in was just 10 past 7.  I hoped they would still be in the room.  Now I have a train pass that is good in Austria, but in Czeck.  My plan, get to the border town, buy a ticket.  Actualallity was quite different.  I tried to buy a ticket, but Austrians said I would have to buy it from the Czeck.  I didn't have their currency, but hoped euros would work.  I met a mother and daughter from Arizone, and she said good luck because she had been kicked of before.  Well my pass worked.  They didn't pay close enough attention to it.  I can't explain how relieved I felt, and how this act would cause me to commit other such acts, some would fail.  Now this train was small and the worst one I've ridden in yet.  I can't believe I got there, as I was sure the chickens and goats through my window were laughing, knowing they could beat this mechanical beast in a race.  I arrived into Prague.  This might be the first time I truly felt lost.  I hadn't looked up where the train station was or where the hostel was in comparison(another reason for a computer in the dorms, easy access to researching trips).  I tried to find an ATM, but with no luck exchanged currency instead.  I'm sure the rate wasn't that great.  I decide to go ahead and take a  taxi.  This car had no safety belts, I noticed the speedometer didn't work, but the driver seemed to know his way through the cobblestone roads.  Tackling them with grace, it made me long for my car.  Driving, something I hope will never be taken away from me.  I don't want to go into detail about Prague.  I saw the clock, went to a Communist musuem & Natural history museum, took a walking tour, saw Prague Castle, Jewish Ghetto, and old town square.  The city is beautiful, food ok.  Just try and not pay attention to all the tourist shops that are more present than the McDonalds and the KFCs.  I saw an acoustic guitar performance.  They  played songs by Vivaldi, Bach and the sorts.  Truly a great show, and one made all the more interesting when being played in a church.  I bought a CD of it, my first souvineir purchase.  Don Gionvani.  An opera Mozart created for the people of Prague.  The people I were with wanted to see a marionette show of it.  I was guessing it was a good tourist trap.  The stage would be in someones basement and us sitting on bean bag chairs.  Close enough, it was in an attic.  I wonder how hard it is to control these puppets.  Watching them clumsly walk around stage I feel I could do better....even at the young age of 6.  The music and plot were entertaining though.    I thought Amsterdam was forward with sex. Ok, it is.  But I would have prostitues come straight up to me in Prague and start talking in English. Which brings me to one quick point.  Why is it always beggars and crazy people I meet speak English.  So now these hookers were trying to get me to purchase a service  I had no desire in.  One even grabbed my ass and said sex discount.  I wondered if the ass grab was an attempt to get my wallet.  A wallet safely secured in my front zipped pocket of my jacket.  I must add here that the weather in Prague was miserable.  Some of the coldest weather I've experinced in europe.  One night, we had a guys night out and decided to go to the Cabaret close to the hostel.  This was my first strip club experience, and I can also see it being my last.  I'll admit the girls were beautiful.  It was also cheap and a different scene than I had expected.  They just dance and no one throws them money.  For some reason I seemed to be the popular one there.  Several strippers would get of the stage and give me a short lap dance.  I wondered why they didn't go for my friends next to me for their lap was just as available as the next.  So now most guys would love this, I didn't care for it.  If the lights had been turned on Im sure my face would have been as red as the bricks on the wall because of embarresment.  If you like, you can go downstairs for a private show.  So after the dancing the strippers would mingle with the crowd to help convince you to purchase such services.  3 out of 8 in my group did, I turned the offer down.  The next day were to take a bus to another Czec town.  However the planner of the trip couldn't figure it out.  I need to bring to attention the fact that I was excited of meeting up with group in Prague.  I didn't want to be in control of knowing where to get to places and etc.  In the end I realizd relying on such people will get you no where literally.  That day I spent in Prague discovering it on my own.  A group was a diverse group, but a numerous amount were from Korea.  American is very much indiviualistic as many times I tried to get the group to split up so everyone could be happying doing what they wanted to.  To them a group consensus was a neccessity, one that would lead us no where.  Anyways, I also found bookstores with English dialogue.  I purchased 6 books.  I also hurridly wrote down other titles I would like to read, but didn't want to carry them around for the time being.  I've realized if I dont write down what crosses my mind that instance it will quickly be lost for my mind is continually busseling with thoughts.  I also keep a list of songs I want to download when I get home.  Next stop Shittybest, I mean Budapest, but it is shitty.  That too was a night train.  One in which sleep was often broken because of crossing borders and having passports and tickets checked.  Made for a long night.  And this has made for a long entry.  I shall continue on tomorrow.

      You know what I miss from back home.  Syllabus day.  That day where all you usually get is that document and instrutions on what is about to come.  My one class doesn't start for another two weeks and the professor has already emailed us telling us what we need to read.  Back home I usually do read the books, but there are times when you don't have to.  Here, they are all about the reading.  I've realized the setup finally, its all about theory.  They don't teach practical at all.  I personally think they should switch to  a combination.  Anyways, we have to pick up our syllabuses before classes even begin.  I don't care too much for that, but when in Rome....  So tomorrow begins another break.  This one is about two weeks long and I should be gone for most of it.  I can't wait to travel, see something new.

      The end is coming  So I thought about that last night lying in bed trying to get to sleep, I have less than 100 hours till I am done with school here in Maastricht.  I thought about this and many other things laying in bed last night.  Its gotten warm here these last few days so I have to have my window open.  No AC, stupid dutch.   I lie on top of the covers pretty much sweating, not the most pleasant sleep. Outside my window I hear one femenist talk about her favorite singer, Alanis Morisette, and why she likes him.  Then I heard some Peruvians and Spanish kids talking.  No idea what they were saying, it was in Spanish.  I also heard a lot of birds.  Then theres the bugs.  No bug screens like Ive said.  I have my reading light on above me, just listening to my walkman.  I see big ones and small ones swarming around it.  Of course I occasionally have to slap my arm, leg or chest.  At least they aren't West Nile Skeets.  Classes are over and the studying has been going nonstop.  Almost everyday since last Saturday Ive been studying over 10 hours a day.  I have so much to cram into my head that everything becomes a jumbled mess.  Listening to my walkman on the way to library I think about how I know every single lyric.  I wish memorizing marketing research articles and all of their hypothesis and whether or not they were proved was that easy.  Guess not.  Tuesday night.   International drink night at the Twee Heren(it means Two Men in English, dumb bar name).  Well I hadn't been there since March is my guess.  I walk in, its crowded and hot.  It was my idea to come, now its my idea to leave.  I buy some drinks and decide to make a stay at.  A hour later, and many drinks later I am on stage dancing.  I got dragged up and I dont care.  I dont care how dumb I look up there, I know I have no rhythm, no need to tell me.  But Im telling my friends here, Im like I dont care because I will never see anyone in this place ever again.    So we decide to go to Meta, a club.  I thought I was there for 15 minutes.  Turns out I was there for a good hour or more.  Im surprised that I was there for so long, because I remember saying I need to go home.  The walk didn't seem so long this time around.  I threw up once I got to bed.  Now I wouldn't include this, but its funny because I have a mesh garbage can with no bag in it. Let me tell you how much fun that was to clean the next morning.  I sleep in the next day, and Im not able to eat.  I wake up to see I fell asleep on my glasses and they are bent.  I also see that I used up the roll of film.  I remember taking 3 pictures, I wonder what the other 8 are.  I get to class, so I deserve credit for that.  After class, I put my key in the bike lock and break the key.  Long day.  I get the lock off finally and feeling out of it I decide to walk my bike and go check out the zoo.  Its really just some animals in a chain link fence area, nothing exotic.  They got goats though.  The weather was nice that day and it felt good to be out.  Thursday everything is back to normal.  I get my glasses fixed....for free.  YES!!!  The library has actually been closed these last two days because of Ancesion day.  Finals are around the corner and they close the library.  Stupid Dutch.  Even on the weekends they are only open for 7 hours a day.  Not much compared to back home.    Need to get back to the books.

      You know you'v been in Europe too long when you start dreaming of exchange rates.  The exchange rate from my standpoint has dropped considerably since Ive been here.   While Ive lost money in every transaction, I will benefit from my deposit.  A little bit of arbitrage.  So there is this French guy in my marketing class who has left for France for the next ten days.  He hasn't seen his girlfriend in two weeks, so he needed to get back.  Most of us were thinking, two weeks isn't that long of a time.  Plus with finals next week, he could be distracted with wanting to go out with her and all.  Still I was jealous of the guy, he was following his heart and not his head.  I am someone who would like to be that carefree, but still am very much rational in my decisions.  Finals are just a bit over a week away.  Ive started studying for them, because I am somewhat afraid of failing.  With no prior midterms or exams I have no idea what to expect.  The thing I hate about finals week is that it is always so slow.  Time comes to a halt.  But then that makes you wonder about time.  Since our time here is limited, it should be good that days are slow.  We should hope for days such as these.  Still I want this week over done with ASAP.  And hey say a prayer for me to pass my exams.  I need all the help I can get.  Also say one for world peace, thats a good thing too.

      So they just made an annoucnement that the library is closing at 1pm.  The reason.  Because today is the official opening day.  Makes me wonder why today is, since its been open from the time I got here.  Why close it?  The library is meant for the students.  Yesterday I went to the renovated grocery store.  Good ol C1000.  While it looks nicer, it isn't that much better.  So this lady pointed in my basket at the Frosted Flakes.  I had no idea what she was saying.  So in English I said, "Yeah Frosted flakes are good."  She just kind of stared at me.    Its one thing I've come to realize will be different coming back home.  Everywhere around me is another language being spoken.  It will be weird to be sitting next to strangers and know what they are saying.

      The French Connection  This could be called the last minute trip.  Everything about it came together at the last possible moment.  Deciding to go to Paris really only happened the day before we left.  Not much planning was involved, just a call to Eurolines reservation center to get a seat from Brussells to Paris.  Here is the trip.  We needed to catch a train to Brussels Friday night to catch our 6am bus.  Well we decided to take the last train to minimize our time in train stations.  So we needed to catch the 10:10.  We actually were running down the platform to get on this train.  The conductors were telling us to hurry up.  As we jumped on, the doors closed.  So we are in Brussels, and realizing we have to spend the night here isn't that exciting.  We decide to go into town, walk around a bit, maybe find a bar.  Well we are heading into town and are going down this street.  I've never seen so many prositutes.  Honeslty over a 100 on both sides of the road for several blocks.  Random.  We get close to the center and find a bar.  After a few hours we are tired and need to catch some sleep so we can hit Paris hard the next day.  Walking back to the train station we discover its closed.  We decided to catch some sleep on the benches outside.  We find a good row of benches.  Out of no where a total stranger sits right next to me.  Its 3am, there are plenty of benches, and yet this guy decides to sit next to me.  I was just about to lay down, but now he is too close for me to do so.  I get up and choose a different bench.  One of the guys I was traveling with starts talking to him.  He seems nice enough, talks about Nirvana and his home in Morocco.  I fall asleep.  Within 30 minutes I wake up, shivering.  The temperature has dropped and all I have is a fleece sweatshirt.  I truly felt like a bum, I was lying down with only a backpack and was so cold.  All I could do was lie down and shake.  Around 5am the train station opened up and we went in.  It was cold in there too, but no wind.  Hanging out on a bench, a random guy all of sudden comes from right behind.  He was about to grab my friends backpack, his attempt was not successful.  This trip made me realize that I can't wait not to be a broke college student.  Spending the extra bucks and get a hotel room and the comfort and security it includes.  So we get on the bus, it was a hour late and go to Paris.  The four hour trip was a much needed nap.  We get into Paris and try to find a hostel.  Last minute trip, we didn't reserve.  So the first one we went to was booked (not much of a surprise, mid-May, travel season).  We go to the tourist office and they give us a hostel that has rooms available.  Now we are trying to catch a 3pm afternoon bike tour.  Well we are running late, and are actually running through subway stations.  We emerge from the underground and run to the Eiffle tower trying to find the group.  We missed it by 5 minutes.  Back to subways stations, to this day I still love coming up from underneath.  Its always a new sight, you never know what to expect.   So we hang out by the tower, Im doing one of those typical poses.  Pretending Im leaning against it, supporting my weight.  All of I suddden I hear Dave, Dave.  No way.  It was girl I knew from my marketing class back at A&M.  She had just graduated and was touring around europe for a few weeks.  That has always been one of my hopes, run into someone a world away out of blue.  I guess I can check it off.    So now we just walk around.  The river Siene, Arc de triumph, Champ-Ellyse, the Louve, Notre Dame, and some other parts.  It was an good time.  Random thing, true it was near the Louve, touristy area, but the place was selling Coke for 10.40 a liter.  Now I know I can pick up a 99 cent 2 liter bottle down at the Texaco not more than two blocks from my apartment.  I could make some money in Paris.    The next morning we decide to go to the Louve.  Mona Lisa, great painting.  Is it really better than all the other pieces inside this huge museum?  Whose to say, but I don't really think it is.  Saw the sculpture of aphrodite.  I was like hey lets put our arms inside our shirts and pose next to it. For those that don't know, the statue s missing its arms.  We go ahead and do it.  I was thinking we'd get some stares.  Why are you being disgraceful?  This is art, not humor.  Instead we got our pictures taken and some laughs.  I appreciate art, but now and then its better just to have some fun with.  After the museum we head to the Latin quarter, grab some lunch, and just walk around.  The guys have to get back because they have classes on Monday.  I stay around another day.   For the rest of the afternoon, I check out La Defense, Monte Marte(an amazing view of the city on top of a hill).  On one subway, I notice this Asian couple get on (Im sitting right by the door).  All of a sudden the guy is attacked.  I don't know what happened, but before I could act on it, it was over.  The French guy was off the subway and the Asian was sitting down with torn pants.  Im guessing the French guy went for a money belt or something.  Still I felt bad for the guy. Im sure his trip was a little less enjoyable.    I get back to the hostel around 10ish.  Even brought out the marketing book and read an article I needed to.  I must tell you it rained everyday we were there, forgot to mention.  So now I have strangers in my room.  One guy is in his 40s, and carries around his Jack Kerouc book.  I must admit, I've always wanted to read his poetry.  Anyways, while our conversations was limited this isn't the guy I want to grow to become.  Hes in his 40s traveling alone.  Saying words like cool, man, and the such.  Im sure he loves his life and that is what is important.  Still if I told him the VW minibus was waiting down on the street, full of petro, with no destination known he would have said Lets do it Man, it'll be one hell of a journey.  I'd rather not be single, traveling alone and staying in youth hostels when Im at his age.    The next morning I was going to go on a tour, but with the rain I decide to go ahead and axe the idea.  I walk around, see Sorbonne, Luxembourg gardens, and just walk..a ton.  The rain is picking up and Im getting too wet.  I decide to go ahead and check out a book or record store.  Well I find this cool little record shop.  I hang out in there for about a hour.  Listening to all sorts of music.  While they had the big American artists, they had a ton of independant ones as well.  Had an entire section.  Even found a single copy of my boy Mraz.  Made my day.  Checked out a bookstore, then needed to catch my bus.    So I want to go to the bathroom.  Number 2 in fact.   Im at the bus station, and to open the doors you have to pay 20 cents.  So I put in my money, open the door, and look in with nothing but shock.  It was disgusting and didn't even had a seat.  About to squat I decide to check to see if there was tp.  Nope.  I get out and leave.   Boarding the bus, the driver said we weren't allowed to use the bathroom.  I just closed my eyes and fell asleep.  The bus was a hour late.  I missed my train.  Made the last available train.  This train was running slow, I would have missed my connecting train to Maastricht, but since it was the last one they held it back.  Thank God.  I couldn't imagine spending another night in a train station.  Thinking Im going to have to walk the 40 minutes or so back to the Guesthouse I'm not too excited.  However all the city buses are lined up.  I hop in one I need, and in about 2 minutes all of them take off.  It was the last round.    All in all France was a great time.  It ranks near the top of favorite places of been to.  Rome is still on the top.  London might be higher up, but I need to back one day and explore it a bit more.  The French were also a lot nicer than I was expecting.  Their English isn't that good, but they know some, where as I would not be able to help a French tourist in America.  Also there is something right with the French gene pool.  The French girls put the Dutch to shame.  Plus they have style.  Dont get me wrong, the Dutch have a certain style to, its just one Im not too fond of.    2 more week to go in Maastricht.  I've realized well that isn't all that much time.  Im starting to study and before I know it, it'll be over.

       Who looks like a 12 year old?  If ya guessed me, youd be right.  I haven't had a haircut in almost two months, which for me is quite some time.  It was really shaggy looking  I decided to go ahead and get it cut at this Korean place that is cheap.  Well seeing how English is there third language(not fluent) I guess I got what I should have expected.  Its real short, but it doesn't really matter.  It'll grow and I can always wear a baseball cap.  We got our grade back from the paper/presentation.  We did good.  Its funny looking over the paper, most of the marks came from the section the Dutch student worked on.  I don't care all that much because our grade was better than what I thought it was going to be.  What I do find funny is that I have hardly ever written papers using references and the such.  Still I had an idea of what to do.  During the editing phase the Canadian girl prefered her way of referencing.  Sure maybe it is a legit style, but we got marked off for it in every way.  This Canadian is so controlling and always thinks shes right.  Well she aint, but I am.  kidding    Tonight I leave for Paris, actually Brussels.  We are catching a 6 am bus from Brussels to Paris tomorrow morning so that means we have to take the last available train to Brussels from Maastricht tonight.  We will get into Brussels around midnight.  So that is a good six hours of doing absolutely nothing in a train station.  Why not take any earlier bus, like a Friday afternoon one you ask.  Well the reason is sad in all honesty.  Its because I didn't want to skip a class.  Since I've been in Europe I've only skipped one class, and that was the class I ended up dropping.  So guess what Im bringing to Paris too, a textbook.  Exciting times.  Im on a bus or a train long enough to get some reading done I figure.  Anyways Im hoping in Brussels tonight there will be some bums to talk to.  Im guessing we will try and find a bar and stay till close.  I think Belgium is out to get me, for it won't be the first time I have to sleep there without a bed.  Im looking forward to Paris, well mainly the Eiffle Tower.   I'm sure its just ok, nothing special, but I've always wanted to see it.  It will be a nice escape to get out of Maastricht for a bit before studying for finals kicks in.

      Today is a good day.  Our group just gave our presentation.  We were creative and made it pretty group interactive.  We made up a Jeopardy board (totally my idea).  It made for a late night preparing and everything.  In the morning our Powerpoint still wasn't exactly right.  It was difficult to coordinate each our individual sections.  We have a Dutch student in our group who was gone all weekend and couldn't meet up Monday till late in the afternoon.  Stress is a funny thing.  There's this Canadian girl who was in my group.  Nice girl and all, but a little bit controlling.  Then when things don't go the way planned, she freaks out.  Maybe if she was more flexible then it'd be okay. I was in her room helping her with her part.  We each chose our parts and she always thinks she has more to do than others, even though we all come to an agreement on who does what and make sure its equal.  So I was in her room, listening to her complain.  Jokingly trying to help her realize how small of an ordeal this, every five minutes Id be like stop bitching.  You're driving me crazy.  I'll leave you.  Which made me think about why I stress.  I was really relaxed about this paper/presentation.  I knew it would come together and quicker if she was calm and took everything in that needed to be done and do one task at a time.  It made me wonder then why I stress about my classes.  I am in control, I should do fine on my exams.  I've done pretty damn well in my four years of college.  Its just school too, wait till I have a career and a family.  Yet I still have my doubts about class, something I really need to work on.  Is my stressing over?  Unlikely.  I will work my best to keep it to a minimal.   So heres a helpful hint on presentations.  Prepare what you are going to say.  Really know your material.  Practice if need be.  Dutch girl went first, she didn't use paper much but kept on saying uhmmm and pauses.  The Canadian read her notes a lot, not looking at the group.  I was a combination of the two.  I spoke to the class not using my notes.  However when I needed to use notes, I would have to try to find them.  Wasn't the most suave way, but in the end it worked.  This was really the first presentation I believe that I wasn't all that nervous.  Another reason for the good day.  Im going to go grocery store shoppping.  Many would dread this, but here is what is in my fridge (no lie)  2 limes (left over from the previous roommate), a tub of butter, an onion, salad dressing, and salad.  Now this lettuce in a bag is kind of gross looking.  Did I throw it out?  Nope.  I think its just a funny thing guys do.  We leave it in there hoping that magically it will become edible.  The pantry isn't much better.  A thing of spaghetti noodles and half eaten jar of peanut butter.  So its safe to say I need to hit up the store, plus the one I like is suppose to reopen today.    Looks like Im going to Paris, its not set, but I am going to the train station to see if I can get the discounted student ticket for this weekend or next.  Maybe the reason the most important reason why its a good day, THREE MORE WEEKS.  Thats all there is left.  3 weeks.  Also one month from today I will see that ol Lone Star flag waving.

      Start with the bad end with the good.  European Community Law.  I don't like it.  It might be so much the material, no that is exactly what it is.  I am so lost in that class its ridicolous.  Refer to Article such in such, which then you will have to look up another article, but section three of that article.  Endless numbers.  Then we have to read these cases and because they are in such legal terms I have no clue what is going on.  I feel as smart as a chicken.  The professor doesn't help much either.  I can not understand him because of his accent.  Dutch, Spanish, French.  I don't know, but Im pretty sure its annoyning.  Yep thats it.  Annoyning.  Since I can't understand him anyways I dont care that he talks a mile a minute.  Im so confused that even if he slowed down I would still be lost.  I have so many issues with this school and Im looking forward to sitting down with the advisor back home and discussing them with her.  I am taking the same classes as Europeans and even other Americans who are 27 years old and getting their MBAs.  Hmmmmm does that seem fair.  I'd have to say no.  I am getting undergraduate course credit for a graduate level class.  Thats bull shit.   Plus my grades transfer on some messed up scale, that is if I pass the classes which honestly wouldn't surprise me if I didn't.  Easily over half of the exchange students I've met have dropped or failed a course.  I already dropped one, maybe I should fail just for kicks.  Except I can't allow myself do that and have been in the library basically everyday this block.  Good news or I should say random.  Talking to a German student in my class  he mentioned how in highschool he was an exchange student for a year.  I asked him where.  He said Montana, and I was like oh thats where I group up.  Told him Billings, he said thats where he went.  We ended up going to good ol West High together.  He was a senior there, my sophomore year.  However we realized we had some of the same professors knew some of the same people.  Biggest kicker was he was on the tennis team.  While I didn't travel with varsity, I was at practice everyday and so was he.  That is truly a small world.

      So I finished another book a few days ago.  American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.  I remember seeing the movie and wanting to understand it more, hoping I could get a better insight.   Well the movie was disturbing in parts and well the book was worse.  Plainly stated it was really gross in parts.  I enjoyed the movie more, which I believe is a first.  But if anyone has read it, I'd like to talk about it, because there was some symbolism and I am not able to grasp what it means.  The new book on the bed side table is Accordian Crimes.  Its an International best seller so it must be good.  Still it has stood there for a few days and has yet to be cracked open.    Other news. 1.  I ended up making tacos.  Not just beef.  Not just chicken.  But both.  I went all out.  They were good too, which surprised me because I was pretty damn skeptical 2.  I asked my professor if I could write in the book we are allowed to take in on the exam.  He asked what I had intended on writing.  So I was straight up honest with him, my notes.  He laughed, and then said no.  But I guess Im able to write some in the book.  I think Im going to have rely more on memory than text 3. I got my bed back last night.  Since my roommate is gone I have two beds Im able to push together and its great.  But eveytime some one has a friend over they ask if I can borrow one.  I really am not allowed to say no because then I would be a jerk.

      Randomness 1.  Services Marketing teacher told us today about 50% of the students fail this course.  Isn't that a kick in the pants.  Still, she is from America and I think or should at least hope she has some sympathy for me.  She said she doesn't like how classes are set up here.  Well in all honesty, no shit.  You don't learn much yet work outside the classroom takes up so much more time.  Another paper and a 2 hour presentation due next week.  Woo hoo. 2. I think I saw an A&M baseball cap.  He was coming in a door I was leaving and it caught me eye.  I would have said something, but I was surprised and it happened too quickly.  Or maybe I'm just a poor ag. 3. Im suppose to cook dinner tonight for 6.  I have problems cooking for myself alone, let alone 6.  Ordering pizza for delivery is tempting, but I think I'll go to the grocery store and see what I can make.   4. 4 more weeks

      One Month.  Four and a half weeks.  31 Days.  No matter how you look at it, my time here at Maastricht is coming to an end.  Am I counting down the days?  In a few words: yes.  I've seen pretty much all I wanted to in Europe, which in essence was the main reason I wanted to study abroad.  Ok, I should say I've seen pretty much all I can afford to.  Anyways its been a good time, and Im sure these next few weeks will be just fine.  Still I can't help but get a little anxious to get back home.  Living over here is fine, true I have issues with the restaraunts and the grocery stores, but its just I miss everyone back in College Station.  I've really been thinking how my college life is almost over, less than 8 months.  I just want to get back to everyone I've spent the last few years with and enjoy every minute of it.  Soon enough I will be  wearing the corporate suit working the 9-5(yes, I realize it'll be something like 7-8).  Still I can hope for that 8 hour work day.

      Random News: 1.  I saw the guy with the biggest mustache ever yesterday.   2.  I got an email from UCS, wanting me to talk to them about setting up an interview.  Supposedly I sent them my resume.  I really have no idea when, and in reality I don't think I ever did.   3.  I almost fell asleep in class today.  Sitting in lecture for two hours can get to you. 4.  In random interviews, usually seen in magazines, they might ask the question to a celebrity or famous muscian if you were stuck on a deserted island what five albums would you want.  I've been in Europe for over 3 months now and have 10 CDs.  While I still listen to them, they are getting old.  There is no way 5 could be enough.

      Well its been several days since I written.  I wish I could say I've been traveling around or way too busy to write, but in essence it is quite the opposite.  Its rather boring here lately.  But here's some news.  Monday our hall had a dinner.  I cooked my egg dish.  It was either that, pasta, or quesidillas.  Since I lacked the ingredients for the the last two, eggs it was.  Tonight Im also cooking up an egg dish.  I've been the biggest mooch.  The people I hang out with rotate cooking dinner, and I think I've only cooked three times for them.  That comes out to like once a month.  They like to cook though, and I do dishes.  Fair trade.  So today I went grocery shopping.  Finally found a stick of deodarant.  Not much to really choose from.  All they had was one brand.  In the same aisle I saw a husband staring at Maxi pads.  I felt sorry for him, he seemed lost.  If I was in his shoes I would have felt the same.  Still it made me smile, and shoot someday I probably will be in that position.  Ok, so getting to the grocery store, I have always walked outside and around the complex.  I figure there has to be a way through the complex, rather than around.  Today I discovered it.  I live in a hospitol.  Its really weird but I see patients walking down the halls every day.  Well I walked down a staircase and through some halls.  It was a whole new world to me, one in which I live in and never noticed.  I found an orthodepic shoe store, a blace called body imaging(I think it might be tanning salon), and many doctors offices.  Its strange, but in the end I have now found a shortcut.  It only took me three months.  Other big news, in my kitchen here I have one frying pan.  Yellowish, looks 70ish, and is hellish to clean.  Well basically all the teflon on the bottom is gone.   I have heard that you can get a new one at the front desk if you exchange it.  So I decided to see if that was true.  They were shocked when they saw the pan.  I said its ok, I was still able to cook with it.  She's like you're going to get cancer.  Walking down a hallway to a supply closet with her, she was like thats very dangerous to have been using that.  You probably won't get cancer, but you might.  Who knew that teflon was so bad for you. It wasn't like I was eating chunks of it.  I guess I'll be back here in 30 years to sue the place.  Random side note, there is a security guard walking through the computer lab, he makes sure we aren't eating, but he also turns off the Num Lock key.  Some other people have noticed this, and we think its to turn off the small light saving some energy.  If this is the case, it only proves how cheap the Dutch are.  It's ridicolous.

      Good news and could have been better news.  Good news: Parents come into today.  With only 40 euros left on me its a  good thing they come in this afternoon.  Earlier this year I applied for a Business Today conference.  Its an conference that brings in international students to New York where we learn some stuff on business.  There are many corporate CEOs and other powerful members of business.  Last year Ralph Nader was one of the key note speakers who I think would have been pretty interesting to listen to.  Anyways its a conference put on in November and is all expenced paid.  Flight, hotel, food.  Not a bad deal.  Heres where it could have been better.  I got wait listed.  I don't think that has ever happened to me.  I either make it or I don't.  Anyways they only wait listed 70 and are confident 20 of those will be allowed to attend.  It depends on there summer fundraising efforts.  Lets hope big business puts out some money because I really want to go.

      The Long Wait is Over  Last November I remember thinking what is going to be in store for me.  How will Europe be?  Am I going to like it?  What kind of people will I meet?  This and many questions ran through my head.  I couldn't wait to get over here and see it for myself.  No longer through photos and movies.  To see it through my own eyes, using all my senses.  By the time the month of May got here I couldn't wait to get back home.  If I knew what I do now, would I go to school here in Maastricht?  I'd have to say no.  I would have chosen an A&M program or more likey would have saved my money to go traveling.  Still I have no regrets.  And as the famous saying goes, so another chapter ends and a new one begins.  What did I learn over?  I learned how much I like Kabob sandwiches(thank God for the Turks), I learned just as you can't talk your way out of a speeding ticket in the US, you can't talk your way out of paying a fine in Budapest's subways.  I learned that Eiffle tower is bigger than I thought it would be.  I discovered that Rome is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  I discovered I can be oceans apart from home and still find a way to meet up with friends.  I learned(ok, Ive known this one) that I always doubt myself come exam time.  However I must add for these finals for the last 10 days I studied at least 12 hours a day, so I was just really prepared.  More importantly I learned quite a bit about culture.  As Dave Matthews says in a song "everyone is different, everyone is the same."  Its true, interacting with others differences can be quite noticable, to the way we dress, to how we eat (I still can't get over how the Koreans were always eating with their mouth open).  I learned no matter where you go you will meet some amazing people, and at the same time you there will be a few assholes along the way.  We all have hopes, we all have desire, needs, wants, we all experience emotions and thats what makes us humans.  I learned how much I value my friends back home.  It wasn't the fact that there wasn't ice in the drinks, or that I didn't hear English spoken around me, or that I didn't have a car.  Ok, X that last one.  I miss the driving thing, I hope Houstons freeways are ready for a lead foot.  I realized what I miss most about home are the friendships I have and all of the memories that have come from those relationships.  While one of the first things I plan on doing is eating some tex mex, drinking a margrita, I think I'll be on my phone calling friends before that.  It will be different these last 6 months back home.  Many friends have graduated, and many including myself will be searching for that perfect 9 to 5er.     My journey isn't quite over.  I meet the parents tomorrow and then through the next 9 days or so go to Munich, Bratislava, Vienna, Salzburg and Interlaken.  Then I get to experience one of my worst memories.  I will get back to the dorm just to check out and grab all my luggage.  I then get to lug this on and off trains and drop it off at the airport.  I fly to London, where a bench at Gatwick airport will become my bed for a night.  I then fly to Houston with a layover in Atlanta.  Flying home on Friday the 13th...oooohhhh SCARY.  Not so much.  Then in Houston I get to sit back and relax......at Hobby airport for three hours before my parents are able to pick me up.  They fly in later and to Intercontinental, shame on them.  I've been in Europe for over 4 months.  Doesn't quite feel like it.

Well since nothing that new is going on in my life I have no need to write.  Its been so long that the website has actually changed and I am unsure of how to post.  Need to get back to work.

      Females and fists....  This weekend, it was alright.  Friday night went to Northgate.  I really don't like drinking beer and have realzied that Long Islands are my drink of choice.   It was a game weekend and was I excited?  Not really.  I'm not the biggest football fan and add some heat and standing to the mix and you got a bad mood Aggie. Saturday night it was back to Northgate.   Alcohol can make people do different things.  It can make people be obnoxious, makes people talk louder, and can even give guys and girls confidence to approach the opposite sex.  It can also make people do stuff out of the ordinary.  So here I am going to a bathroom in a trough for two.  Theres me on one side, and theres a girl on the other side squatting.  She really had to go and wasn't about to wait in the girl's line.   I felt bad for her, here she was finished and can't find any toilet paper.  One guy offered her some newspaper, but it fell to the urinated beer soaked floor. I can't explain how disguting the bathrooms along Northgate are and how desparte we all become to use one.  Alcohol can also make people angry, and fights can errupt.  I don't know how it happened, but all of a sudden punches were being thrown pretty close to my friends and I.  People scattered and immediately some guys jumped in to try and break it up.  More people started throwing fists and the fight moved a bit closer.  Instead of getting out of the way, I wanted to help break things up.  One guy came running and my instinct was just to grab his arm.  Picture a deer in tailights.  Thats what I looked like.  For one full second I was staring at this guy's eyes and the my only thought was so this is going to hurt when I get decked.  He said something like your right, knowing that I wasn't in the mood to see a fight yet alone become part of one.  Best Buy still has my computer and I hate them even more.

      Technological glitches and crappy customer service.  Nature.  I love it and try to embrace it.  I also am very well aware that I live in a modern world where I have to have a car, be able to watch TV, and talk on a cell phone.  Alas I am middle class American with a background in suburbia.  Nothing to be ashamed of, but it can allow you to forget how fortunate you are.  When something is no longer there whether it be a friend, relationship, or material position you realize how much it can can affect you.   I am very dependent on a box with some components that move, beep and even light up now and then.  Its a computer and something that in the last two decades has found itself in common households throughout the US.  Basically my computer has stopped functioning.  It turns on and thats about all it does.  Teasing me with the desktop icons that appear but don't open.  A task bar at that bottom that can do no task.  Is it broken because its an Acer, its sort of old,  or that sweat shop labor wasn't up to par that day?  I'm not for sure, thats why I am having it worked on.  By the way, the last one was a joke and sweat shop labor is something that shouldn't have ever existed in the past and by no means should exist now.  Well this whirling mechanical machine has my college life on it.  Everything I've ever typed, downloaded, or scanned.  Its all there within the grey metalic confines.  I hate thinking how much I depend on computers, but in the end I do and that is just a fact of my so called life.  Best Buy has now had it for almost a week.  I could write many paragraphs on this subject alone, but I won't.  Im about to hop in the car and the public would be better off with one less road rage induced driver.  To sum it off they have crappy customer service and don't seem to be know what they are doing and do an even better job of not telling me whats going on.

      Trying to one up Pee Wee.  Everyone should have a big adventure now and then.  A big adventure doesn't mean going abroad or packing up the Volkswagen Minibus and heading for the California coastline.  A big adventure to me is doing something you've always wanted to do.  A yearly dosage of big adventure leads to a life of no regrets.  Starting to sound like an infomercial.    I have been fortunate in the sense that I have had the opportunity to do an incredible amount of things(I'm trying to think of a better word).  I've seen most of the US and after Europe, I have now been to about 16 countries.  I've gotten to ski in the Alps, to white water rapid in the Rockies, snorkle in the Grand Caymans and hitch hiked in Seattle once.  All big adventures, all great memories.  There is a list I have created that says "To do before I die."  It is possible that I could die tonight in a freak car accident and it is because of this that I will try to cross the things off the list sooner rather than later.  While not on the list because of its longer term commitment, it is still a desire and one I am now seriously contemplating.  Growing up in Montana you begin to appreciate nature and the cycle's in which it goes through.  My favorite stretch...winter.  True when its cold you're miserable, while driving you constantly have your hands on the 10 and 2 and your eyes on the road for you are fearful that next patch of ice will take you off road.  Winter however brings snow skiing.  Some of my happiest memories are me on the mountain whether with friends or on some desolate trail all alone.  I've always wanted the ski bum lifestyle.  Living in some crappy apartment with a bunch of roommates and the only thing on the floor besides half empty pizza boxes is GoreTex and puddles from melting snow.  Depending on the job I land(and this saying I land one, which I think I should) it is my hope that they tell me training will begin in June.  Now I'm not for sure how many corporations work this way, but I do know a few like to wait to train once the May graduates have finished their courses as well.  So to my future interviewer or recruiter, I want to work for you, I will give it my 110% minus 10% on Fridays but if you let me have December till May I might just be a happier person.   I should also have for you a few extra stories to tell around the fabeled water cooler.

      In the land of corporate backdrops and color coordinated polos.  Today was a long a day.  A day I spent 12 hours away from the apartment.  Days like these make me wonder about the long hours I will have to put into work.  I'm going to die.  I realized something though, I want one more adventure while Im in my 20s.  Some can see starting a career as an adventure, and I do have to admit to a certain degree it is.  However its not the adventure I have in my mind.  I want to head to the mountains.  Be a ski lift operator.  In New Zealand.  Now that would be ideal, but I would like to trade in the dress shoes for a pair of flip flops or ski boots.  So if any corporations are reading this.  22 Male marketing major seeks major corporation.  Enjoys bonsues, high starting salary, vacations, and creative work.  Dislikes egos, long hours, and cubicles.  Willing to commit, but not till June.    I went to the engineering career fair today.  Alas I am a marketing major, but as I have learned many times its all about networking.  I observed a few things at that career fair that struck me as amusing.  They say there isn't much diversity on our campus.  Well there is, and it comes in the form of engineers.  I feel sorry for those male students who are engineers because well its almost all males.  Now those who are girls have the pick of the litter.  Lots of options.  Resumes I believe should look professional and at the same time unique.  Engineers I believe do have a different thought process for the most part, one that emphasizes structure over creativity.  Which makes sense for the line of work that they are involved in.  It shows up in other places such as their resumes.  I honestly saw just a handful that weren't Microsoft templates.  So I guess ol Microsoft deserves a pat on the back.  Engineers really dont have the best social skills.  Realize I am not saying everyone, but the vast majority.  They also don't have the best business fashion.  I was surprised how many didn't even dress up.  The ones that do fall under two categories.  Those who wear their father's clothing from the 70's and those who are horribly color blind.  Social skills is a lot more than dressing up so I would listen to them talk to recruiters.  None of them seemed enthusiastic or knew how to sell themselves.  I have a ways to go, but when the guy in front of me starts talking to me about Encino Man out of the blue I figure I'm a little further than others.  I managed to talk to several companies.  Me fake smiling, them returning the fake smile.  They'd all have the same engineer joke, engineers are smarter or something along those lines.  I'd be sarcastic right back and point to my GPA and with a real grin say yeah I'm pretty smart too.  So some took my resume and said they would forward it in the right direction, most gave me a corporate website to go to.   I really had more I wanted to say about the career fair, but the thoughts have escaped me.  The classes in Maastricht don't have grades for them yet and now I wish it would stay that way.  Today I started the process and was happy with the A in marketing, but got a B for EC law.  I explained my reasoning for why I deserve an A, but he is pretty adamant that it stays a B.  Im sure it won't move.  I guess it was the only thorn for the day.  Blooming roses for the most part.  Later on, early evening I suppose, I went to the BCG presentation.  Its a company I would love to work for.  Its also a company that chances are slim to none.  Try hiring 50 students total from about 30 universities.  I'll still try, its worth a shot.  But talking to some of the recruiters one already has deferred entrance to Harvard.  How does that work?  Hey I want to go your grad school, but in a couple years.  Harvard says, "Sure no problem, you're on the list."  Must be nice.  However I did get to hang out with Jessica, and got a free dinner out of it.  So I can't complain.  Jessica and I are going to start are own company once we come up the perfect idea.  Anyone else want in on this start up drop me a line, we'll do lunch.....

      Dreams and why they shouldn't be interpreted.  I have come to realize how bizarre dreams can be.  Now and then they do relate to something I am going through or tie into an event or something I saw that day.  Last night doesn't fit into one of the two categories.  I was at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean.  The Titanic had sunk and the ocean was to be my final resting place along with thousands of others.  Here's what they don't tell you in the documentaries about this catastrophe.  Since the Titanic was so large it displaced a lot of water and created a huge dome of air over the wreckage.  No longer did we have mere moments before our death, but more or less 10 to 15 minutes.  People took out their frustrations at the bottom of the big ocean, many were being killed merely for sport.  Then for some reason everyone settles down.  There was a plethora of blankets and sleeping bags and I decided to go ahead and lie down.  I'm laying around joking with people I do not recognize and we are talking about our immediate fate.  Then all of sudden everyone stands up.  There's a submarine(picture the one in Disney Worlds 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea with a lot of windows).  Now I didn't think about this all that much last night, but no one decided to get on it.  In fact the people that were on it had come off to die the slow death with us.  I am now wondering how the submarine got into our air bubble.  Now I guess these people on the submarine were like the good ol boys, everyone stands up and applauds them.  A football team coming home for a ticker tape parade type of an event.   People settle down.  I am laying on my sleeping bag struggling to breathe but perfectly ok with the idea of dying.  Right as I take my last breath I wake up.   Dreams are most bizarre.

      Older kids, still the same playground.  Here it is, 10 AM and I am at work.  I'm pretty impressed that I am able to make it to work at 8am everday.  I guess this will only train me for the next few decades of a career.  So I'm sitting at my desk, it not mine per se, but hell I sit it in everyday I'm calling it mine now.  My work load has been pretty light.  I've been doing a lot of database entry, but now the new director isn't so sure how helpful it is.  He feels no new companies really needed to be added and after inputing data for over a thousand I lean more on the tend to agree side of the continuum.  Right now I'm at my desk shifting papers around, have a serious look on my face as if I'm lost in the assignment.  Truth be told I'm lost in thought......the thought being nothing.    One thing that never ceases to amaze me is office gossip.  Everywhere I work people talk behind others backs.  They want to know what is going on, why is that person being an ass or bitch, depending on gender of course.  The thought can't but help cross your mind, what do others say about you.  It's better to go through life and not worry so much about this, but be yourself.  One of the assistant directors brought me into her office to talk about somethings the director shared with her about her work.  I can't help but feel uncomfortable.  The director is a couple doors down, its your supervisor and here you are going off on him.  We are all adults, but when you look at how we act we still are very much the same kids hanging around the swing set talking about the latest happenings.  I'd rather be the kid on the swing without a care in the world.

      Dave thinking...."you know what its time to start writing in this again."    This is my last semester at Texas A&M as an undergraduate and most likey forever.  I call it my half victory lap.  I am taking 9 hours, and while I no longer have the dream Tuesday and Thursday only schedule I have amazing professors.  I am able to pay attention and more importantly want to pay attention to what they have to say.  I still have a class with 300 plus students, helps me remember that A&M still considers you to be income for the most part.  Since I will be graduating in December, this is the semester where I try to find a full time position.  Good luck with that.  I have the credentials, lack the motivation.  But at the same time I am on the ball and have been researching companies and dropping my resumes for companies coming to the Career Center.  There's many companies that I just don't care for.  Do I really want to sell plumbing fixtures to businesses?  Nope.  Do I want to be a store manager at the Buckle?  Not at all.  I realize you get more out of something if you pursue it.  You see the challenge and take it on with your own two hands and it is you that accomplishes a task.  I'd prefer a job just handed to me.    It's really crazy for me to think about that in three months I will most likely know where my first job in the so called real world will begin.  Now working in the automobile industry in Boston isn't even possible, but thats what I want.  Next best thing would be a job in the automobile industry or working in Boston.  Somehow I see myself starting off in Houston.  As long as I don't have to rely on I-10 to get to and from I should be alright.   The four seasons, the crispness of fall, the snow shoveling of driveways, and the other joys might have to wait.

      "You just want to be a kid...."  Thats a quote from a co-worker of mine today.  She guessed it right on the spot.   She is going for a Masters in HR.  The only aspect of HR that I find may be somewhat interesting is labor negotiations, such as the contracts that involve unions.  I know there is probably a lot more involved than compensation, salary, hiring/recruiting process, but the one part I know about and have no desire to do is the firing.  I asked her if she could fire someone, this someone being a good worker, not a slacker or a thief.  A worker who is going to suffer because the corporate parents would like to see the shareholders have a few extra bills in their wallets.  She said yes.  Maybe at some point I'll be a manager and may have to make the same decision.  I don't know if I could.  I don't know if I could let a mom or dad go who are working to try and support their family.  I don't know if I could crumble under the pressure of Mr. CEO who has his 20,000 square foot home(not to mention the Hamptons beach property) and vehicles that cost more than a decent salary.  I can't help but wonder if my boyish thoughts will someday fade away as I turn into a man with a gray suit and striped tie.

      The Ellusive 6 Pack  The Rec.  If you are an A&M student you have been there.  It is this large building filled with all different sorts of sporting and workout equipment and more importanlty boys trying to impress(or look at) girls, and girls looking at guys.  It's also a place I dread going to.  What is it about these natural highs?  Oh I just worked out and I feel so great.  Bull shit.  I just worked out and am sweating like a pig and smelling worse.  I then hop into my stick shift car and it feels like I have to put all my strength into just to depress the clutch, my calf muscle quivering with each gear change.  Then there's the stick, this little piece of metal that has to only move inches, but after a work out seems a good yard or so.  I get back to the apartment and am tired and don't have much more energy.  Then here's the kicker.  I burned maybe 600 calories, but now I'm so hungry from working out I eat them right back up.  A visicous cycle.  Yesterday I worked out for the first time in a week and a half (I usually try to make it 3 times..lately twice).  Anyways Im as sore as can be.  Is that a benefit of working out?  I don't think so.  Top 10 things I hate about the Rec. 10.  The water in the water fountains is always warm 9.    People who put there stuff in a locker, but don't lock it.   8.    Carrying around that stupid towel.  Sure it wipes up some of the sweat, but Im sure those foam seats absorb their fair share. 7.    People who don't understand the concept of working in on a machine. 6.    People who carry around their cell phones.  Can you put away that little piece of plastic for a hour or so?  Believe it or not there is something that is called voicemail where people can leave messages 5.   I will end here because I'm tired of thinking of different things.  My greatest annoyance though are people who camp out in the parking lot waiting for a spot.  Isn't the point of going to the gym to get in shape, burn some calories?  Because really, parking in Reed is just miles upon miles away.

      Chopsticks and Cosmonauts  I love space.  I love the idea of how it is still expanding and I love how I can't even then contemplate what lies outside of space.  The idea of the stars we see is light coming from millions of years ago.  There are no boundries and while our knowledge is expanding it is at the same time very limited.   I had no idea that the Chinese were going to send a man to space until I read it on CNN's website.  Good for China.  I realize just going outside the Earth's atmosphere costs a pretty penny and now a good size yen too.  I just feel that it is justifiable no matter the expense.  Who knows whats out there.  Inteligent life?...I'm sure.  Resources beyond our wildest dreams?  No doubt in my mind, it has too since we are just one solar system in one galaxy of many.    I'm a kid who will never truly be content.  My mind will continue to wonder and question.

      Four plus years at A&M equals nothing.  Highschool was a breeze.  I don't remember ever cracking a book.  The only exceptions were a paper I wrote for English and my Advanced Calculus class.  Other than that, everything just came to me.  The concepts were easy to grasp and I graduated at the top of my class with a full ride to a Montana State.  I've been told by parents and recruiters alike what they look for on a resume.  I honestly thought I had it down.  I have a 3.87 GPA, my electives went towards a Certificate in International Business.  Not too shabby.  Do you have any international experience?  You bet...try 6 months of it.  Work experience, not only have I tried to maintain a job the past two years while attending classes, I've also landed two internships.  One of them landed me in right in the middle of Manhattan in advertising the summer after 9/11.  An economy that was hurting especially in the Northeast and the respective industry.  Leadership experience.  Yep got that too.  I've been involved with many different parts of campus.   It's not restricted to business, but also community involvement and other aspects of the campus.  Last semester of my senior year and I am feeling pretty damn good.  Jump back to reality(now I got that Enimen song going through my mind).  I can't complain too much, I have had one interview and five more already lined up.  I am confident that a few more will trickle down.  Still there are many positions I have applied for through the Career Center that I wasn't selected for.  In addition I've been doing some job researching of my own using the Internet.  I've filled out countless personal forms, answered questions (technical & personality aptitude) with no avail.  What are these people looking for?  I guess inside connections.  It all comes down to not what you know, but who you know.  That's a shame.

      Aber and Crombie need to go back to fashion school.  Ok a couple weeks ago I buy some T shirts from that store so beloved by highschoolers living in surburbia around the US.  I'll admit, some of their stuff I like, hence I did buy two t shirts.  However I don't see how anyone could spend close too a 100 bucks on jeans that already have holes in them.  I got a 30 dollar pair of jeans that I put holes in myself.  Now thats a bargain.  What I really want to know is who works in Abercrombie's sizing department.  I am large with respect to t-shirts with any company.  Long sleeve, polos, sweaters, same thing all large.  Now here I am wearing a large Abercrombie T-shirt that is definitely on the smaller size.  It's suppose to make me look cut and if I wasn't in that good of shape(translates to not scrawny and not fat) I'd look like even more of an idiot.  Who do they think they are fooling?  Frat guys obvisouly as they are the common wear in the halls of Wehner at the bars of Northgate.  Girls sizes didn't escape in the inner workings of Mr. Fitche's money making scheme.  Girls might feel special buying a smaller size, but the truth is they are still the same size.  On a side note: I have read some of my past postings and I admit my grammar is not up to par.  It's just when I am typing I think I am using the correct wording, tense, punctuation, and so on.  So just deal with it.

      The world is a beautiful, amazing, and one fucked up place.  I love life.  I love everything about it.  The emotions we experience, the relationships we build, the sights we see.  Our lifes can range really from a couple days to 100 plus years if we are lucky.  I wish we all could be that lucky.  Today a suicide bomb went off again in the Israel/Palenstine region.  A country or area of the world that I truly don't know if it will find peace in my lifetime.  I can't imagine living over there and not being fearful.  My mind would constantly wonder about my personal safety everytime I hopped on a bus or saw someone who didn't look like an Israelite.    While I can't imagine, it seems to me America doesn't care.  This country is great.  We have freedoms, we are starting to embrace diversity, the opportunities are endless.  9/11 was a tragic event and it brought reality to many Americans(I am generalizing Americans from here on out in this entry, there will always be exceptions).  Its hard for me to think that this was the first time people really tried grasp terrorism.  Its been going on through out the world.  It's been 2 short years, and what is the country concerned about now.  Jobs.  Job market.  Consumer confidence.  Gross National Product.  Numbers, mindless numbers.  Everything and anything concerned with the business economy.  How easy it is for us to forget what happens and what is going on around us.  How easy is it for us to forget that there are soldiers still risking their lives in Afghanistan, Iraq, and really throughout the world.  America wanted to rid Sadam and his evil regime.   Most likely Sadam is still alive as well as ol Bin Laden, but America doesn't care.  They aren't voicing their opinions.  A country who was willing to go to war to end Sadams rule, the same country where no common man if asked would be willing to go.  Americans want to see what the Dow Jones is at, and if its not on the upswing well then it's a horrible day.  I don't forget about terrorism, starving children, landmines in Bosnia, missing toursists in Colombia, lack of medical treatment in the South East Asia.  I think about it everyday.  Every morning and when I go to sleep.  I can't forget because I don't think we should.  Even though I have these strong opinions, I am American as the people next door.  While I think about it, I don't act and there in lies my flaw.

      Southern Gentlemen and the Elusive Job Search  I've noticed one thing on the on-campus busses here at A&M.  The more the country the boy looks the more likely he will give his seat up.  All corp guys do too.  I've also observed how foreign male students never give up their seats and then there's the inbetweeners (me included), and then there's classic A&M country.  I give up my seat, but I really wish I could sit.  I do realize then I'd look like a jerk.  My computer is now fixed.  I also lost about 100 emails in the process.  I had some I kept that I always thought someday I would go back and read.  Have something to bring a smile.  Then there were a few job opportunity ones.  Those I wish I had.    The companies coming to career center do not excite me to the least bit.  I just look at them and think blah.  I can't sell.  I doubt I could sell a snow cone on a hot summer day to a bum for free.  Its just not my personality.  Interview signups have slowly started, and every week I take it there will be more.  I had the opportunity to interview with Wachovia Securities for an investment banking position.  I decided to decline because life isn't worth working 100+ hours.  I wouldn't survive, and I'd like to have a bit more fun.  There's a few buying positions that interst me, but right now it is the energy company positions I truly desire.  Me and probably every other Ag who is from Houston (so about half the student body).  I thought I would have a good chance of finding employment, but it's starting to look a bit different.

      Real Mexican food is in Texas  I have this list on my wall.  Actually I have a couple of lists pinned up on the bulletin board.  One list is titled things to do before I graduate.  I have a month left, its time to start putting some X's next to the items.  First thing that gets the cross mark, George Bush Museum.  Anything to say?  Not really, it is a museum and for the most part they bore me.  Texas, the largest state in the contiguous United States.  A state home to three of the top ten cities in terms of population.  A state that at one point was a nation itself.  A state that just so happens to boarder Mexico.  Mexico a place where the American dream lives and cheap tequila flows.  Mexico is only about a 5.5 hour drive.  5.5 hours for legal drinking age to be pretty much non existent.  A short jaunt where you can buy chicklett bubble gum and talk the little Spanish you learned in high school.  We are in Mexico, we need to eat Mexican food (but not drink the water).  I learned something America does better than Mexico.   Mexican food is like tex-mex but bland, one more chalk mark on the scoreboard for America.    We found a club where 8 bucks (10 talked down) could get you unlimited drinks.  This club had several floors, and a basement were you could forgo the steps and take either the slide or one of two poles.    The fireman in me always opted for the pole, except once where I had to give the slide a try.  Upstairs they had an outdoor patio, where low and behold was another check mark waiting for the pencil. The mechanical bull.  I've always wanted to ride one and what better place than Mexico.  The first time I got on, I pretty much got off.  It was harder than it looked and at 2 bucks I figured the bull won its match.  Later that night maybe with the drinks talking to me or the my George Washingtons itching in my pockets I gave in.  I did a lot better and rode it in true rodeo fashion with one hand raised in the air and a look of concentration on my face.    Other highlights include the power going off, meeting but not buying from Johnny the Mexican crack dearler, seeing an electric chair of sorts where if you can take the highest voltage you get your money back(it was closed, but still found it pretty shocking(no pun intended) that it existed).  We ended the night at the Corona club where the opening scene of Desparado is filmed if anyone cared to know.  An American girl came up to me and asked if I wanted to dance, and then apologized because she said I was in highschool.  I said I'm 23 and she didn't believe it and wanted a look at my ID.  With drivers liscense ready she was soon proved wrong and now wanted to dance.  Lesson of the story:  If you judge me by how I look you won't get your dance.    Crossing the Rio Grande late that night not only did I now have my rights as a United States citizen back, but also have a few more memories of my years at A&M.  As James Taylor sings in one of his songs, "Oh, Mexico.  It sounds so simple I just got to go."  I now have and my pencil now rests on top my desk, freshly sharpened waiting for the next adventure for that fateful X.

      Payless....maybe the should pay more on their facilities.  Yesterday I was in the great midwest state of Kansas.  Topeka is not only the state's capital, but in addition houses Payless Shoes headquarters.  I'll admit, I went there not too excited about the company, but I'm even less excited about the economy.  I guess Payless for me is a whole pride issue.  I've put a lot of effort to be the student I am today with the background I have.  I want more than Payless.    Anyways I went to Kansas to rack up some more frequent flyer miles.  I also went because I have an open mind and wanted to see what they have to offer.  Two negatives:  Don't give a guy who is slightly over 6 foot a Chevy Cavalier to drive for a hour and a half.  When my knees are doing the steering, I need more leg room.  Also don't put me in a hotel thats not that decent, but on the far opposite side of town.  I'm not so negative as not to realize that flying me up was an expense for them.  I am still grateful for having the opportunity to visit.  Upon arrival, I went into the lobby where I saw a few other candidates.  Blank stares all around.  I was the first person to actually break the silence and start talking.  After a short introduction, the interviews began.  There were 4 of them in a row, approximately 30 minutes each.  I felt I did just fine on them, but who knows what they saw.  My favorite interviewer was a lady with a great sense of humor.  However all of sudden she went off tangent and started saying don't trust anyone.  That there is office politics in this male dominated job.  I don't know if she looked across, but I am a white male, kind of fit the mold don't you think.  All in all, I really did enjoy the people I met and hearing their experiences.  After the wrap up I went to Lawrence to go surprise my Grandma.  It took me awhile to find her, but alas she had cards in her hand and playing a good game of Pinochel (spelling???).  Back to Texas.  So now I have a few more things going for me.  In a few weeks I will be in Michigan interviewing with Ford Motor Company.  I've always been passionate about this industry and I can only hope an offer is extended.  Also recently I have been informed I have made final rounds for Accenture.  Two of my top three I've applied for I've made it to finals.  As a Montanan just might say: I'm stoked.

      Big fish in a small pond or small fish in a big pond....How about big fish in a big pond.  When I came to A&M, I was number 468-88-9976 (obvisouly not my real social security number).  As I sat among hundreds in my classes I was just another name less face with a pen in a hand and a beat up notebook on the desk.  Years have gone by and not much has changed.  Classes have for the most part become smaller and interacting with the professors is now more frequent.  I've done well for myself with internships, high GPA, and extra curricular activities.  I'd say I'm a decent size fish.  Not the biggest, but definitely not one you would consider tossing back.  The number I now am, that question is up to the HR Recruiters and other managers I have interviewed with.  If you do some quick math my new number is probably around 452.  The number of people who I am competing against for the same jobs.  I'll be generous, give or take that number a bit.  I am competing for a coveted few spots at a few companies.  I am competing among hundreds of A&M students for a chance to have a second or on site interview.  Magic time machine takes us forward...WHOOOOOSH.  Okay, I'm now at the corporate office or at least a major center for their business.  I am about to go through multiple interviews.  Now not only am I still competing with the best A&M students, but now there are students from Rice, UT, and other schools thrown in the mix.  No matter how you do the math, the odds aren't in your favor.   Lets throw in a kicker, a mulitpler to increase your chances.  Wait a minute, that multipler does not exist for me because I am a white male.  I agree that diversity in the workforce is important.  I feel companies that ignore this have the potential to fail in the long run.  However when you are in the position of a potential hire or a potential reject, you may take a step back and feel things are unfair.    So lets hope the economy turns around.  Lets hope the GNP increases and that the unemployment rates continue to decrease.  Lets hope that corporate america is about to toss out their commericial size fishing nets, and me a simple fish gets tangled in the webbing and brought on in.

      Trick and tricks.  Halloween.  A holiday that comes around once a year.  Images of witches, pumpkins, and ghosts consume peoples' thoughts.  Man how it is changed throughout the years.  As a child it is a festive time, one wear cavities and sugar headaches dance around in your mind.  Then there's that pivotal age.  That age wear trick or treating becomes childish.  I wonder who ever started that.  My guess was just pompous 5th or 6th grader who never liked dressing up.  So from junior high through high school Halloween becomes costume parties or helping the parents distribute candy to kids who are just like you were a few years ago.  If you were like me, it might have meant doing a little egging or toilet papering.  Misspent youth?  Nah, I loved every minute of it.  Yes, when I am someday an adult and have to clean it up I am certain I will gripe about it.  Then I'll realize somethings just don't change.  College Halloween.  For the most part just plain dirty.  I've some real creative costumes now, from a guy who is a shower stall to a man dressed up like everyones favorite drink Jaegermeister.  These creative wears are usually worn by the male population.  Girls on the other hand resot to a different tactic.  Substitute creative for slutty.  A simple outfit like a Girl Scout all of sudden becomes a mid drift baring cosmopolitan drinking girl.  Dorothy from Wizard of Oz was a simple Kansas girl, raised on a farm and unfortunately swept away to a magic land by a tornado nonetheless.  Magic land now becomes Northgate and simple Dorothy is now ass hanging out cleavage showing girl trying not to get with the just the tin man, but the scare crow and the lion.  College Station has been home for 4 years now, and there really is no place like home.

      Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Hello Concrete Pavement  At 8:51 this morning I put my pencil in my backpack and put that bubbled in grey scantron in the test basket.  I was a free man walking down the stairs of the chemistry building and two thoughts crossed my mind.  First, damn it's cold outside.  Second, so I'm done huh?  The last 4 and a half years have built up to this moment.  Ok, maybe they really build up to actually walking down the aisle, shaking President Gates hand, and receiving the diploma.  However I know I passed my classes and I know in my heart I have received a college degree.    When I first started here at A&M, I'll admit I didn't enjoy it all that much.  College life was not meeting my expectations.  Today, my opinion of the place has not changed all that much.  I still feel this school has a way to go if it really wants to become one of the truly great public schools in America.  However I'd be lying if I said this school has not provided me with some amazing opportunities.  I've worked in New York, studied business in Europe, and got to meet some truly remarkable people all along the way.  Young and old.  Now even though the job market is supposedly still tight, I have several offers with 2 of them being in my top 3.  I am grateful.  This may just be my last post.  Still with either job I take, come on we all know it's going to be Ford, I might be laying on that hotel bed bored and lonely with thoughts running through my mind.    Still if I could leave any advice, unfortunately I'm too young for it to be words of wisdom, it'd be this: Never Settle, Always Dream.   Life isn't about getting from point A to B, just as college isn't from Freshman Orientation to Graduation.  Life is everything that happens inbetween.

      A manilla envelope or my fate.  Here I was standing (not sitting because I was too nervous) about to open up that plain looking envelope with David Hoffman typed in the center.  Was I about to receive an offer that most likely I would accept or was I about to receive a letter that would end up being the complete opposite?  Turns out it was the latter.  The letter basically said while they were pleased to meet me and have the opportunity to learn more about me, at the time they did not see a match with my experience and their opporutnities.  Funny thing about it, I was OK with it.  I wanted this job and if they called me saying that I received the wrong letter I would still be interested in the position.  Still overlooking Michigan from the Hyatt I was OK with it.    Is there fate?  I don't  know.  I'm someone who really likes to think that we are here on Earth and control our own destiny.  Still there I was really wondering if there is another plan for me, a better more suited plan.  I've had nothing but amazing experiences these last four plus years at college.  Maybe there was more than my own doing in respect to these experiences.    What I'm going to remember most from Michigan is not the facilities I saw, the case I did(which I really did love my answer), or the crash dummy tests I witnessed.  What I enjoyed were meeting a lot of different candidates throughout the US.  Utah, Arizona, Penn, New Jersey, Boston, NY, LA, and the list goes on.  Almost everyone I met also was a genuine person.  I was talking to students in their late 20's wrapping up their MBA to a student a Northwestern at the top of his game.  No one was really full of themself.  A simple descriptive word in everyone's college dictionary, they were cool.  Last night I sat at the loser's table, but as corny as it sounds felt like a winner.  Here was a group of 5 of us sipping on our expensive hotel drinks just getting to know one another.  As the night continued students retired to their hotel room or had to hit the road for the drive home and probably a longer one now.  We said our goodbyes, wished each other luck, and smiled.  As I shared an elevator with a Boston girl, we held the elevator door open long enough to say goodbye.  She said isn't this weird how we get to know one another and leave.  I said it's interesting, but makes life fun.  Really it does.  Here were these people that I only got to know for a couple hours, but have left a footprint in my memories.  Maybe like the tides of the ocean on the beach they will fade away, but it happened and I enjoyed it.  I hope I'll remember them, and if that Indiana girl drops her engagement and our paths cross again well that could be a completely different story.  As our hotel shuttle van drove to the Detroit aiport, REM's "Everybody Hurts" was playing softly through the speakers.  Everybody does hurt sometimes.  We would never know and appreciate happiness without the bad and dissappointing times.  Other opporunities are awaiting and I can already see the light underneath the next door waiting to be opened.

      T minus 4 and a half years coming to an end.  There is really two countdowns when you enter college.  There's the one countdown that includes the end of your college career.  The friends you say goodbye to, the town you might hate but have become accustomed to disappearing in your rearview mirror, and the memories, like polaroid pictures fading away after so long.   This will be an entry in itself when in slightly over two weeks I will be considered a college graduate.  The other countdown ties into it, but for me is separate.  The countdown till you work your first real job.  You go to college to learn about yourself, develop relationships, and basically mature to a certain degree.  However you wouldn't go to college if it did not lead to a job.   A career filled with hope, that will soon become just as cluttered as your email's inbox.  Let's go to the beginning.  I love cars.  Love them.  Trucks, SUVs, convertibles, sedans.  Love them.  I grew up with a 1930 Model A in the garage and a dad who could fix it.  I've seen several different vehicles take those oh so coveted garage spots, while older models baked in the sun and became snow covered in the winter.  I've driven from Montana to Texas alone.  I've driven to New York from Texas.  Shoot, I even even driven a vehicle in Europe.  I love cars.  I came to A&M wanting to design them.  Wanting to give shape to the next Corvette or the new Grand Cherokee.  Engineering classes broke my compass and in its place was a pen to work out the business aspects.  Still, same industry, still the same love.    I tried everything.  I've flown to Detroit to talk to representatives.  I've even sat down with a designer in his studio to share my aspirations.  I've mailed resumes, I've made calls, and have gotten horrilby lost in websites.  I also networked at my current job which in all honesty has now put me on a plane to Detroit.  4.5 years have come to this two day affair with Ford.  It's amazing that a college career consisting of 1640 days comes down to a measily two.  Now let's just hope I can answer questions intelligently, keep food off my suit and a smile on my face for the next 48 hours.

      Timing is everything, or so they say.  Have you ever looked at life in the terms of time?  We all have.  There are 365 days, 52 weeks, 12 months, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in a hour......Who created time?  In my opinion it was man, not God.  God did create the universe and this planet on which we live, but he didn't invent the clock nor the calender.  A lot of sport performances are about who has the best time or who scored the most in the 16 minute quarters. In business we create short term and long term plans that look at what needs to be accomplished from a corporations standpoint in the years to come.  Individually we have tasks that we know need to be done by a certain hour.  We carry around daily planners in briefcases and backpacks, looking at them because we know there is only so much time in the day.  I don't wear a watch because well the last two have broke(stupid Canal street vendors).  I like to say I don't have a watch because if you notice people who wear them thats what they do.  Look at their watch.  We should always enjoy the present and be content with that.  Still I am someone who remembers the past and dreams of the future.    Can timing be off?  Do you ever wonder what would have happened if you left on the road 10 minutes earlier.  Was it because you were delayed that you now you have a safe drive and didn't end up in a horrendous accident.  Have we already seen the person we are to marry and that right now it's not the right time.  Maybe it was a simple smile on a crowded street, and our paths are to cross again.  I think about this and wonder.  I've even shared two hour flights and really liked the person I was next to.  This being a girl around my age.  Maybe someday seat 13 F will have more in store and maybe it won't.  Life is about the unknowns, but life is also about taking risks.  I now and then wish I wasn't the practical minded person I am, and would leave for the Caribbean and open up a Scuba shop.    Sitting on a beach with the sunset in the distance...that'd be a good life, one worth not counting down the days and allowing myself to ignor those red numbers on an alarm clock

      "Something inside me is breaking Something inside says theres somewhere better than this"~Five for Fighting  The alarm clock.  I'd like to think who ever made this contraption had a horrible life and wanted others to experience the dread he went through every morning.  However, there it was with zeros a blaze in red like the devil's own eyes singing a tortuous song out the top of its head.  A song that is eerie, haunting and yet familiar at the same time.  Putting on my suit I can't help but wonder who is that kid staring at me.  Who is that shaggy blonde hair, green eyed boy, with a couple days facial stubble?  He's wearing a suit much like mine and a tie I too remember seeing in my closet.  It just doesn't look right.  Outside it is dark and quiet.  Lonely.  Motor city at this hour is still a sleeping industrial giant.  Its gears and pistons will wake up later, for now I am the one moving.  My car is covered with a layer of ice, much like the grime that builds on my eyes overnight.  With a little scraping it'll be removed.   It too, like eyes will take awhile to fully shed the extra weight.   The road is a combination of expansion joints and potholes with a bit of concrete in-between.  A back massage at this hour would be great, but one not this rough.   We live in a world as ants.  We are marching our little feet not really paying attention to what's around but only ahead.  The company checkbook is our queen.   If we don't sustain our queen we die.  We are greedy and follow what we believe is the road paved with gold.  We drive with our eyes gazed ahead with our worries riding shotgun and our dreams taking a back seat.    The backseat.  Where as kids we would sit looking out gazing at the exciting surroundings.  Now those same stores and buildings are nothing more than concrete and steel created for one use.  To put clones like myself in them, with a cup of coffee in one hand and a report in the other.  We strive to become successful all the while forgetting what defines someone as successful.  Glancing in the rearview mirror I catch the reflection of my own eyes.  There's still a bit of glimmer in them and still a bit of mischief.  It's not will power, it's just a slight turning of the wheel to the right.  In white painted font on a bright green rectangular background, the sign glows like a beacon.  Exit.

      "I can see clearly now the rain is gone"  Actually I can't.  Still very cold.  Still very overcast.  Detroit.  Motown.  The Motor City.  Also according to amagazine at BankOne(where I set up my account today) it is the most dangerous city in the US according to a poll that looks at murders, robbery, auto theft, rape, drug use, etc.  Oh well, I kind of figured that.  This city is more depressing than watching the movie Life is Beautiful.  Now being from Houston we were excited when we able to shed (no pun intended) the fattest city image.  Detroit now takes that honor along with the honors of one of the most illerate cities in the US.  Second to last from El Paso.    Now its not all bleek here.  I go about 30 mph over the speed limit on the interstates here.  Its not because I have a company car and feel invinsible.  It's just, well everyone else does, seriously EVERYBODY.  If that makes me a follower then so be it.  Then driving today trying to find a Target, I drove past a Texas Roadhouse.  That made me smile.  Anyone seen the movie 8 mile?  Well I live almost right on 10 mile.  So I'm just a short two mile jaunt from that now infamous boulevard.

      Can you judge a book by its cover?  We've all been there before.  We open those large maghony doors to a land filled with enchantment and wonder.  A land where young and old can find something they want to learn more on or simply dream about.  A place where imagination is a prerequiste for coming in.  Barnes and Noble.  It never fails.  I open those doors and right in the center aisle are the new releases.  Here they lay in some arranged order,  horizontal, vertical, diagonal....Some of us look for a book that was recomended, others try to discover if their favorite author is at it again.  Then there's the impulse buy.  We look at covers for something that catches our eye.  Something that screams out READ ME!!!  However how many times does the cover speak the truth?  I've now finished two weeks of training in Dearborn, Michigan.  I've now experienced two straight weeks of depression.  Some may conclude its the overcast weather or the groginess of Detroit.  A city awaiting for its pistons and wheels to start turning more rapidly, being able to bring it back to the importance it achieved in the 1940's.  Then there are the friends and relationships left behind.  I have to admit that this does play a role, but smaller compared to the main reason for my state of mind.  The job.  This job came in a manilla envelope that promised me rewards for a job well done.  As I read the back cover I was filled with joy, it was abou a job in an industry  I love.  It laid out benefits that any college graduate would want and more.  It painted a picture of a career, of a company hiring us to be VPs and not just entry level workers.  The Blue Oval shined and shimmered as it lay in my hands, but soon discovered was really just another emblem painted over hastily.    I leave in a few hours to once again board a plane.  Aisle or window seat, it doesn't matter.  This is one flight that I wish I did not have to board.  That is life.  Life is to be experienced and looked at with an open mind.  Maybe its only how this first chapter is written that has brought me to how I feel.  So far its no page turner, but then plots can change.

      "How many bags are you checking in?"  I don't know.  Technically two.  A garmet bag and a suitcase.  Still I am leaving to Michigan with much more.  I am bringing a bag filled with memories, no carry on could contain.  I am bringing joyous occasions, midnight conversations, and akward situations.  I am bringing 23 wonderful years of me to Michigan.  I've been asked if I am nervous about starting a new job.  Honestly I'm not.  If there's one thing I've taught myself is that I can achieve whatever I set my mind to.  Anyone can, and everyone should.    What my mind has been drifting to is the relationships I've made, the college year ones.  I've shared coffee and hugs goodbye these last weeks.  During these moments when we say see you around, I wonder about the future.  I wonder what will become of this amazing person, this person who has shaped and molded who I've become.  This person who is so influential will be over a thousand miles away.  I hope these people fade like a Polaroid picture.  Instead of becoming a distant memory, that the picture like our friendship will get stronger as bonds tighten, all it takes is a little shaking.    When visiting bathrooms in homes throughout the US, it seems above most toliets there seems to be that cross stitched quote, "Home is where the heart is."  Home is not Montana, Texas, or Michigan.  My heart is with friends and family.  You are what feels like home to me.  I love you all and will miss you.

      The lights go dim....  As the curtain is pulled back the crowd talking becomes but only a slight murmur.  This movie does not have the now ever present commercials, nor the 10 previews.  Instead of a title and the names of famous actors the scene begins with but a boy.  A boy fresh out of college with the world ahead of him who is sitting on the hood of his car laptop in hand pounding on the keys.  Wearing his suit he is sitting on a favorite old sweatshirt to avoid getting his pants dirty.   In front of him laid out like an empty canvas waiting for the colors from my palette to be chosen is the great unknown.  To this green-eyed boy what takes precedence and is more amazing at this moment is the visual spectacle and the vastness of Lake Michigan.  One finds it hard to believe to be a lake when you can't see another shore in sight.  Watching the sunset it conjures up memories of a California trip where I saw the same sun cool off in the Pacific.  The sound of water lapping and the cawing of birds awaken the senses.  A narrator begins to speak in an old gruff voice, but one in which you know has stories to be told and words of wisdom to be shared.  The narrator's voice is my own some 60 years into the future  "I was 23 at that time.  I was young and foolish.  Life held many uncertainties and it was wonderful."  It would be a coming of age movie, one destined to be a classic.  The movie would continue from this point.  This very point where I sit now looking out into vast unknown alone thinking to myself and talking to God.  This movie goes on to show the triumphs and failures of this one person's life.  My life.  It would show moments of falling in love, moments that when you go through you can't believe they are real.  Moments you wish you could store in a box and keep on your bedside stand.  There would also be moments of loss.  Moments that grip our heart with a clenched fist and only being able to truly recover when someone else at some point in time comes into our life when we least expect it.  The grasp releases its hold and again we our able to catch our breath and move on.  There would be moments when everything in his life would seem perfect and that he would pinch himself for not believing in how very real it was.  There would be more moments like the ones he is going through now.  Wanting to sleep.  Not because of how it helps the body recover from a hard days work, nor because the weight of his eyelids grow heavy as the day progresses.  It would be those short hours.  Whether it was 4 or a lucky 8 where he gets to escape reality.  Everything that isn't going right in my world ends at that time.  I myself am unsure of how this movie will end.  Whether it somehow transforms into an action movie with a life ending car chase or one that is merely a comedy tracking my most embarrassing moments.  This isn't a plot that can be written for what the future may hold. Yet is rather like one of those childhood choose your own adventure stories with many different possibilities waiting at the end of each page.  Which direction will our leading actor take is up to him.  That's life and there in lies the meaning.  It's worth living.  To the fullest.  In the meantime, it is time to fold down the laptop and take this all in.  The sun has only minutes before it will give way to a starlit sky.

      2+2=4  I have another equation for you, but let me provide you with some background information.  An empty highway or a city street lit up by lights at night with a favorite CD playing are moments I cherish.  There is something about an open road that I truly enjoy.  Driving with friends is always entertaining, but when I go alone it provides the greatest sense of freedom, I am able to think about what is going on in my life.  I am able to go back in time and truly think.  However there is only so much driving I can do.  The new Explorer I've been driving is no long so new.  It already has over 1000 miles on it.  Now that I am in my region traveling that number will grow only quicker.  Empty road, plenty of time, many thoughts result.  So just how many highway signs and dead bugs am I going to see on the windshield?  The engineer in me still does random calculations in his head.  800 miles a week.  52 weeks in a year.  So that is 41,600 miles.  Now lets say I average 60mph.  Highway speeds are 70 and towns are usually in the 35-45mph range.  So 41,600 miles divided by 60 mph is 693.33 hours.  24 hours in a day.  The number is now 28.33.  That is the whole month of February.  That is 28 days of nonstop driving.  It's 2am I'm tired I need to pull over.  Can't.  28 days of avoiding potholes, wishing for more CDs, sun in the eyes, truck stops, tailgaters and making business calls on the cell phone.    I'm not done calculating.  I can't emphasize how much time I spend thinking when I'm driving alone.  Now lets say you spend on average 8 hours sleeping, 1.5 hours eating three meals a day, and another 1.5 getting ready for the day or for the night.  So now the day instead of 24 hours is composed of 13 hours.  So taking the previous 693.33 hours and dividing it by 13 is slightly over 53.  So you can look at two months of every youthful year of mine is spent behind a steering wheel.  Not the most glamorous job.  But Dave you're making good money.  Maybe so, on the road lots of time another calculation.  Let's take out the added value of not paying for a car and insurance as well as benefits such as medical insurance.  The reason being I don't know what dollar value to assign to them.  I've started to calculate that I will be putting in 80 hours of work in every week.  80 hours of driving to my next dealer, time spent in the office, time spent at the dealerships, and the ever-depressing time spent in hotels alone pulling up reports.  Taking my salary pre-tax and dividing it by 4160 hours (80 hours a week x 52 weeks in a year) comes up to a dollar value of just slightly over $10.  Wow, I am living the American dream.  Truthfully, I want to live all of our childish dreams.

      What do you want to be when you grow up?  A fireman, a teacher, and the ever popular astronaut.  These are the answers, the words a child in elementary school would say.  The only two I can remember were a race car driver and an astronomer.  Never mind the space shuttle, just give me a telescope and a cloudless night.  Time would pass and my ideas of what I would want to do changed.  They still do to this day.  In high school I'm not going to lie, I was a pretty smart and determined kid.    Two subjects I excelled in were math and science.  Numbers and atoms can be proven.  They aren't subject to opinion, they exist, and they are factual.  With this in mind I would go to a top engineering school and follow my Dad's footsteps.  As a kid he would mention big words such as soil contamination and acquisition of refineries.  That's great and all, but when are we going to go sledding.  Now I was walking on these concrete steps about to follow suit a man I had admired and was proud to call Dad.  With a sweaty backpack on filled with pen and papers, I was optimistic of the future before me.  Notes to be taken that would lead me to ideas and help me excel in my career, and maybe change the world in the process.    My path changed and I soon switched over to business.  I'm glad for that switch.  Now I've been in Detroit for the past 7 weeks.  Surprisingly a quick 7 weeks.  Living alone has given me a lot of time to think.  My mind drifts to the thoughts of what I want in a job, in a company, and in life.  They'll change.  Everything does.  I'm 23 and have only just begun living.  Still I need a creative outpost.  This blog was to be a diary, a journal while I was in NYC, a place to put stories, past happenings, and ramblings to tell my grandkids when I'm bald, blind, and incoherent.  Now it is has become a place, where I can put myself out on the line and tell people who are important in my life what's going on in this head of mine.    What does this green eyed boy with a Bugle Boy Jeans and Z Cavarichi t-shirt want now?  I want to get back into advertising.  I'll continue to pursue this.  Surprisingly this is a job that has many characteristics to the worker I wanted to be in 2nd or 3rd grade.  It was a person with values.  A man who didn't have to be 80 years old to be wise.  He's an individual that shared words that I clung onto, and a person who knew how to listen.  It was a person who showed me life's little lessons.  A man that now and then seemed to know me more than I know myself.  I still remember what the picture looked like.  It was a guy with brown hair, a mustache, a blue suit, and one arm longer than the other carrying a briefcase.  His hair now has a little gray and his mustache has a lot more.  The briefcase has been replaced by a good read and the suits now hang neatly in his closet, yet he still carries all those individual characteristics.  He's my Dad.  It was the person I wanted to be, and is still the man I want to become.

      Technology takes away free time.   Here I was at a red light in my new car (take a guess...it's a Ford) on the way to the grocery store. Not even a grocery store, but one of those huge buildings that take up more space than needed where a wonderful park could be built.  Inside you can buy a lawn mower, get the week's office supplies, and a case of beer for the basketball games. One stop shopping.  Navigating the parking lot and the check out aisles it becomes a one stop headache.   It's cold outside and before I even get to the vehicle the doors are unlocked and lamps under the mirrors light up to make sure my shoes won't get soaked by a hidden puddle. Arms a shivering, I turn on my heated seats. Instead of adjusting the fan and temperature, I hit the auto button. The Explorer knows what the ambient temperature and adjusts accordingly. I am listening to a favorite CD coming through the 8 speakers, if I like I could hop in the back and flip down the TV and pop in my favorite DVD. Without a hitchhiker or a friend in the SUV, I decide not to explore this option. My cell phone is plugged into the charger and if it did ring all I would need to do is hit a tiny plastic button on the stereo with a picture of a telephone to mute the speakers.   I am now here at home typing on my personal computer.  Living in the basement I am cramped for space and the company laptop sits sloppily on the bed a glow with the Microsoft Outlook Inbox having more messages than needed. The laptop has a friend called a travel printer, buttons lit up neon green, but incapable of spitting black ink onto the white paper.  I guess the travel printer has racked up more frequent flier miles than I have and has taken a permanent break.  In the background I hear Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan talking on the TV.  Their voices, however, are overshadowed by Ryan Adams playing his melancholic songs through computer speakers.   Conveniences, pieces of black plastic with aluminum trim filled with circuits and wires almost as tiny as a human hair. We as humans become amazed and attached to these belongings. Oh how the buzzing sounds and beeps fill the air around us. Then they break. These things that become as important as a heartbeat stop functioning.  Like a heart attack we don't know how to react. We want to call for help, but are stuck, frozen. After we catch our breath we go back to our primitive past and hit the thing. After that for some reason we think its the day before Christmas and start shaking it likes a freshly wrapped gift. After the poking and prodding we become 3 year olds and complain vocally. We throw little temper tantrums and don't understand how something so expensive can become inoperable. We do all this because heaven forbid we pick up the pages stapled together titled "instructions."  Ten percent of the US population reads ninety percent of the books in circulation.  That 10% is the same 10% that doesnt have the VCR clock blinking 12:00.

      Relationships.....the only thing real in this world  Independance, the first time I realized that I wanted this was in high school.  I wanted to leave the hallways of West High.  Those long drab corridors plastered with 80's paintings and stories from the past but not forgotten locked up behind gray steel lockers.  I wanted to leave everything behind and start a "new life."  The journey would take me to Texas, a state that was a childhood memory and not much more.  I can still remember cramming for the exams that first semester, hating taking showers down the hall, and the days where I thought it would never get hotter.  What I remember more were the days eating in Sbisa alone or looking over a textbook and the only image coming to my mind was the past Montana life.  Years would go by and friendships would be created, these friends would become stronger and more influential than anyone I knew from Montana.  Except my best friend, who I am in contact with on what seems to be a daily basis.  I am thankful.  I became accustomed to waking up in Commons #308, where a roommate and more importantly a friend was just a few feet away.  They were there to grab a bite to eat, get my ass in the gym, or someone just to lay around in the living room and be random around or complain to.  Late December rolled around it was time to leave this behind, it was time to move on.  Again, I'm in a time where I have a clean slate, I can change who I am and what I do.  This time I don't want to.  I've become happy with the person I've become.    Being alone is hard, it's hard for anyone.  I like to think I can conquer the world, I can if I have the right people beside me.  I know that in Texas, NY, Kansas, and Montana there are people by my side, however I no longer am able to see their face.  Conversations and the meaning behind them become lost across the wires.  As humans we are emotional people, the lives of others affect us.  I would love to think that I can control my emotions but when it comes down to it, my emotions have a control of me.  I came across an interesting observation last night when I went to a sports bar with a group to watch the big dance also known as March Madness.  Out of all the people the one I get along the best with and have the same sense of humor with is an Aggie.   I guess there is that Aggie family, which I always thought was a myth.  Recently I spoke to a few people about relationships and one such exchange of words sticks out more than the others.  It was about moving on and letting go of the past.  It's something we can't do.  Photographs fade, but memories don't.  Now and then we get wrapped up in the moment and look back and smile.  Nights alone in bed or on long drives alone they come back almost to a haunting clarity.  The experience no longer a thought of laughter, but a thought of longing.  Emotions will fill the empty void and just as day becomes night we too change from one extreme to another.  The pattern repeats.  These emotions are a direct effect of the relationships and hence makes it more real than anything.  We can not taste, touch, or smell, but they are there.  Just as we can't see the wind, we can feel it and that makes it more real than anything.  There's that saying you don't know what you have till its gone.  It's true.  Still things happen for a reason, a reason that may not be clear at the time or even the near future.  I am not the most religious person, but my parents forwarded me a verse and I hold it dear to me, and I will leave it here.   Corinthians 10:1-13.    "So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall. No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it."

      RRRRiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnggg  The new school week has begun.  This isn't a classroom of periodic tables and the alphabet running the length of the wall.  There will be no teacher with those silly posters of cats hanging from tree limbs with copy on that bottom saying "Hang in There."  Now there are big blue Ford ovals.  The bright yellow school bus has now been replaced by a white Econoline van.  Pencil and notebooks have been replaced with laptops.  No longer is there a green chalkboard in front of us, but a white screen dedicated for PowerPoint presentations.      Still similarities do exist.  The faces surrounding me look tired and exhausted, with daydreams of weekends and escapes.  Questions are running through heads, but aren't said.  The clock drags on as if the batteries are running low.  Gossip seems to be the best thing to talk about.  The lunch room isn't a buzz about who wants to play baseball and who wants to play basketball.  The murmurs are the sounds of knifes being placed in others backs.  The laughter isn't because a guy got cooties from Susie, but a joke one feels they must laugh at.  An exaggerated viewpoint?  Of course, that is just how I write.  Training in big business America is filled with corporate ideologies and beliefs that once in the field don't hold as much truth as they as they should.  They say one thing and yet we witness otherwise.  We are young and want to change to the world, yet we follow suit while wearing suits.  No longer are the dreams of Slip N Slides and baseball cards.  Kiss lyrics to "School's out for Summer," are not being played.  We march to a new a beat, one that just happens to have 401 of them.

      The grass is always greener on the other side.    Many of you that have read this journal can pick up the feeling that I may not be the happiest person right now.  I've been miserable before and I know I will be miserable in the future.  I will experience grief, death of others, unexpected changes, and what will probably be the worst are the things I can't even imagine.  Still here I sit at my business desk in a Marriott thinking how great it would be just be around the roommates and have a conversation about nothing.  I'm not someone who expects to relive the college days.  I wanted out at the end, I was driven to accomplish everything I needed to.  I thought I was mature, but only now have I started to realize all the growing up I have left to do.  All the growing up I don't want to do.    This past weekend I decided to send out my resume to several aggies and several advertising agencies.  Casting the line I was expecting only a nibble.  Instead something struck the bobber quick and hard and it soon disappeared beneath the placid lake.  My inbox did compose of several non person emails...."thank you for your interest in Corporation A, we are delighted that you applied and will be in contact with you if a position arises that we see as a good match.  We also would like to inform you that we will hold onto your resume for 12 months and will look at it for future opportunities."  What surprised me were the emails that said please get back in touch with us, we would like to interview you.  Old co-workers saying to call them as they are in positions to help me.  A great dilemma now arises.  Do I act upon these invitations or do I wait things out?  I've only been here for a month yet my gut tells me that is long enough to know what to do.  Still Ford has put money and time into me and I would feel bad leaving them for that reason.  However I feel at the same time wouldn't hold them back all that much.  They make 15,000 or so for every Navigator sold and I haven't been paid that much yet, so whats one more SUV.  It's a lot less of an expense that their old CEO Jack Nasser aquired for the Fords and I'm just a lowly field rep.  I don't want to kick myself in several months wishing I hadn't given up on Ford.  I also don't want to kick myself when the May graduates graduate and fill positions that I have a chance at now.  Life isn't black and white.  Life isn't risk free either, but we all try to keep it to a minimum.  Here I am in Mishiwaka, Indiana.  I went to the mall this afternoon as my phone charger broke and needed replacing.  Looking at stores such as the Great American Cookie Co. or Radio Shack, I look at the employees and wonder how they have fallen into this routine.  How did they end up here out of all the places in Indiana, the Midwest, the USA, the world?  They are here working at a retail store in Mishiwaka, Indiana.  Did they chase love, did they not want to leave family, is there something that attracts them about their little store or this little town?  I don't have the answers to these questions.  I only have the thought that people settle, they don't strive to find what excites them.  They are content, they stay.  "This is your life Are you who you want to be This is your life Are you who you want to be This is your life Is it everything youve dreamed it would be When the world was younger  and you had everything to lose  dont close your eyes dont close your eyes  yesterday is a kid in the corner yesterday is dead and over"~Switchfoot

      The home remedy  I don't think many people realize this, but when we are kids there is a magician living in our house.  With a tall glass of Sprite always filled and a warm blanket covering our little bodies we lay on THE (we all have one) couch in front of cartoons.  Our sickness would fade soon due to this magician.  It's not David Copperfield or Sigfried and Roy, but rather our moms.    Now some years have past and we are on our own.  In college I never did get too sick, nothing a night of sleep wouldn't fix.  Here I am in a new job, in a new environment, and now on the road nonetheless and something has attacked me.  The first day I figured I can fight this thing, just go to bed early and tomorrow I'll be A OK.  The next day, same thought running through my head.  The third day maybe I should go to Meijer (equivalent to a Super Wal-Mart here in the Midwest) and see what kind of medicine they have.  After my own purchases and utilizing whatever the roommates had the conditions still persisted.  I had taken 4 different kinds of throat losengers (Halls and Ricola included).  I was taking them every 30 minutes, it became my crack and I was addicted.  Now I thought I would mix it up and take some Tylenol and DayQuil, not to mention just a general purpose multivitamin.  My "cocktails" so to speak proved to be ineffective.  In Grand Rapids I decided it's time to see a doctor.  So here I am in a new state with a new insurance card and not so sure what to do.  A co-worker told me of two places and gave directions to closet one.  The closest one wouldn't take my insurance.  Blue Shield/Cross from Ford Motor Company I thought would be a secure bet.  Now to the next place.  All I know is the road I am on and which direction is east and which way is west.   Fortunately the receptionist was able to give me directions.  She must be a local.  One thing is for certain, whenever I buy my next car I will be checking the navigation system box.  There is no two ways around it.    Today may have been the first day my health has improved, however oh so slightly.  Opening my mouth I can barely see that thing that hangs down.  That alone stalagtite attached to the roof is blocked by the swollen sides of my mouth.  Everytime I swallow it feels like someone is stabbing me with a knife back there.  As gruesome as that may sound I can't compare it to anything else.  Eating alone hurts and thats why yesterday consisted of a single donut and half a glass of juice.  My diet now mainly consists of Motrin IB, Tylenol, and a prescription drug.  I would take this combination more, but the labels have advised me not too.  I now feel like I am Bill Murray's character in Groundhog's Day.  Everday I wake up on the same day.  The alarm clock in a hotel bed and the rest of the room composed of all the same fixtures you see in Holiday Inns and Motel 6's.  Those paintings that I wonder where they find, the same brass lamps that are never connected to a switch mounted on the wall, and all the white towels a person staying alone would ever need.  Instead of reporting on whether the Groundhog will see it's shadow or running into the same people throughout town, my life has consisted of nothing more than the hotel room.  I wake up, roll over, grab the remote and turn it to HBO.  When I leave tomorrow for the next Marriott, Home Box Office (his full name) won't be joining me.  However he likes to surprise me, glowing at the foot of the bed of my next destination with movies and programming for me to enjoy.  He is a loyal friend.

      "With no secrets, no obsession This time I am speeding with no direction Without a reason, what is this fire? Burning slowly, my one and only Umm desire, desire, desire, desire  You know me, you know my way Just cant show me, but God Im praying That you find me, and that you see me, And that you run and never tire Umm desire, desire, desire, desire" ~Ryan Adams  I've come to realize, that while my entries relfect a tone of depression that is something I'm not experiencing.  When I wake up before dawn breaks there is an emptiness inside that I am unable to describe.  However as the hours of the day roll on this emptiness dissolves.  The emptiness is replaced by a longing to finish work and head on home.  One thing that keeps me going is to realize I have control over the situation I am in.  Will I like my job in a month from now?  I honestly don't think I will.  I am starting to believe that Detroit is a temporary paycheck.  One that will create a nest egg that I will survive on till I find another job.    I've come to realize my roommates are a little strange for different reasons.  Some are heavily into porn.  Now I would be lying if I said I never saw a pornographic image, but I guess those young curiousity days are long over.  Not for these 26 year olds.  If their DVD collection won't suffice, then there's always the computer upstairs.  Truly bizarre.    I am always up for the random roadtrip, my roommates safe to say aren't .  Every weekend I've bring up the lets go to Chicago for the night.  Every weekend I get the same response, "NO."  For some reason I have a desire to see the Sear's Tower and Wrigley field.  I think it would be fun.  So last night they weren't up for the 4 or 5 hour drive, so I asked if they wanted to go through the real slums of Detroit.  The whole city is in poor shape, but I want to see the neighborhoods with bars on windows of homes and drug dealers on the corner.  However they have assured me that it is just too unsafe to do.  I will always be curious natured.  Again with the roommates, it looks as if 3 of them will be moving out soon.  They bought a house closer to where they work.  Now they aren't getting rid of this one as it has become a side business for them, one in which I'm sure helps fill their pockets quite nicely.  A potential roommate came over and lets just say she's strange.  I'm not a big drinker, I've had a single beer since I've been here.  The other roommates drink more, but not by any ridiculous amount.  Still there are bottles on the counter and twelve packs in the fridge.  This roommate can't be around alcohol, because after a semester of school out of state she drank heavily and as she described went crazy.  Parents will always have a leash on us, and for good measure.  They do know what's right and wrong for the most part.  She came home and now knows not to be around that forbidden substance.  Again, bizarre.

      "Welcome to the fall out, Welcome to existance, Redemption is here, redemption is here, Between who you are and who you could be, Between how it is and how it should be  I dare you to move, I dare you to move, I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor, I dare you to move,  I dare you to move Like today never happened,  today never happened..." ~Switchfoot.  Music, it's a funny thing.  It's amazing how a song can affect your emotions.  Independantly Happy by Blue October is a song that no matter what mood I'm in always puts a smile on my face and changes my outlook.  Then I put in some Counting Crows or Jason Mraz and can't help but wish I was somewhere else or with a certain someone.  A song can take you back in time.  A song can make me remember a memory like it just happened only minutes ago.  I am able to picture laughs, Montana's mountains, tears, and Kansas's plains.    We look at lyrics for what we should do with our life.  We look for artists who sing songs about the same pain we are going through.  To hear such words, we realize we aren't the only ones.  We aren't alone.  Now and then we just try to find a song with a good beat.  What we fail to realize is that we are in control of our own lives.  We have control over the outcome.  We can make decisions, but live in a world of complacency.  We settle and never chase our dreams(seems to be an on going theme).  What's the point of dying rich or owning nice things if we aren't able to use them.  If I ever run for President of the US I will pass a law requiring all corporate offices to install a set of swings and one of those fun curvy slides.  It will be there to realize that we grow older, but should never lose our sense of wonder.  It's installed so we can realize it is the simple things that make life enjoyable and that no work should be stressed over.  Anyways I have a CD collection of 200+ and it will continue to grow.  I can't lie but I listen to music because of the lyrics too.  So for all of you music fans here's a list of Dave's must haves.  If you have these then your collection won't be half bad.  Better Than Ezra, Dave Matthews, Pete Schmidt, Dashboard Confessional, Counting Crows, Jason Mraz, OAR, Ryan Adams, Switchfoot, Maroon 5, Pete YornJohn Mayer, Pearl Jam, Matt Nathanson, Blue October, Sly Letter, Guster, Jackopierce, Matchbox Twenty, Howie Day, Graham Colton, Jack Johnson, Damien Rice, Matt Wertz, Dispatch, Five for Fighting, Train  "You sing a song While sitting at a red light You think of home While sitting at a red light  Too slow to roll Put your life on hold An open path With nowhere to go You start to wonder  While sitting at a red light  You can run a red light Give up at a red light You break the mold When running through the tolls Speeding through your whole life  A chance to breathe  While sitting at a red light You look around  reflecting on your life" Johnny Lang

      serendipity "The faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident"  It's also a romantic comedy staring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale I watched last night in my room.  It got me thinking are we suppose to look for signs.  Not only in love, but in life.  If so then Detroit is screaming at me to leave.  Friday, I met my main supervisor.  I don't like him.  He may be smart, he may be one of the best workers in the office.  Still I need someone with a personality, someone who will at least say hey Dave how's it going.  Instead I hope you are ready for work, we have lots of it(in the back of my head I was like no I don't).    Here's a wonderful thing about the United States second largest automanufacturer.  Ford the company that really created mass production wants you to become injured.  They hoped for more snow this month.  They said sales and sale of parts would be great if there were some more winter accidents.  That's the best attitude, I want to work for a company like that....oh wait I do.  The other day my book case came crashing to the ground.  Instead of trying to fix it and mend the pieces, I bought a new one.  It's better to start from scratch.  Should I be doing the same with my job?  The regional manager, the most important guy in our office just left without saying where.  He left Ford and left it at that.  I ate dinner with another girl who I've been training with and she is certain by month's end she will have left the company.  Hmmmmmm.  Let's be fair though.  Just like any other story, there is another side and one that shouldn't be overshadowed.  However, mwah, being the author gets to influence the plot and the direction it goes.  The pluses, Pac Man is still going to be hungry.  There's only two.  The pay and benefits is good for entry level marketing major.  Second.  Most of my co workers are nice.  I don't really work with them though, my interaction now is due to fact I am in  a shadowing phase.  Still they seem to be wonderful people.  I'm not done here yet, but I just don't know if this place will ever feel like a home.  I want to have that feeling again.  In the quiet hours when we are alone and there is nobody to tell us what fine fellows we are, we come sometimes upon a moment in which we wonder, not how much money we are earning, now how famous we have become, but what good we are doing.  A.A. Milne

      Below is a forward I received from a friend.  I feel it is well written and wanted to share.  Growing 20's   They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like.  You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the, people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you. You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't.  One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward. You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person. One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot doesn't seem as fun. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself...and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.   "Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away."

       urlLink    A blissful fall  We should all pay homage to our favorite scientists.  On random nights when there is nothing to do one should go for a drive in a convertible or hopefully a car that has at least a sunroof.  Admiring the universe and all it contains is something Galileo would be proud of.  Have you worked out and really noticed how your body performs?  It really is a machine and the accuracy to which Da Vinci sketched the human form is remarkable.  Today I decided to practice what Isaac Newton discovered.  Gravity.  The weather was nice this weekend and I needed to clear my head.  I am young and have much of life left to live...hopefully.  Basically accidents can happen, you just have to hope to God they don't.  Still as you may know I have this list of things to do before Death comes knocking on my door.  Today my pencil made another lead X next to skydiving.  My roommate joined me and I was on the road by 9:30.  We were on the way to Mount Pleasant, I was on my way to put on a flight suit and experience what living is all about.  After 15 minutes of instructions and 7 pages of signing my life away we were off in a plane.  That was the scary part.  This plane seemed smaller than a VW bug with wings attached.  Looking around I was amazed this thing would take off from the ground.  There were no seats except the pilots.  So in a single engine plane sat the aging pilot, two single skydivers, and me and the guy I was to go tandem with.  I was leaning on the side of the plane since again there are no seats and he tells me not to as it could open.  Looking at the tape that covered the inside of the plane I didn't doubt his judgment.  At 6,000 feet one of the skydivers made his jump.  My stomach dropped.  I am literally three feet away from this open window with no seatbelt and not attached to the other jumper.  If the plane rolled right and forward I would have fallen out.  Obviously it is safer than what I am describing for they have done this more than once.  Still the butterflies unraveled from their cocoon and my stomach turned inside out.  At 10,000 feet the door was to open again and this time I would be falling out into the sky.  I was strapped in and ready to go.  I knew if I was to think about what I was about to do that I would have gotten nervous.  1, 2, 3...and in less than a second I was going over a 100 mph.    I can't describe the feeling.  It is one in which stories retold only provide a glimpse of the experience.  Remember your first kiss?  It is a moment in our lives that we don't forget.  Go back to that day whether its junior high or later.  Your stomach tighetening, your palms sweaty, your heart beating faster than you ever imagined.  Just wrap up that nervousness, curiousity, and desire into one precious moment.   Then smile at what happened, for me that is what it felt like.  This afternoon I fell over a mile in less than 30 seconds and those 30 seconds seemed like 5.  I checked the altimeter, tried to maintain position, pulled the ripcord,  and automatically felt pain.  The chute basically stops you from the 130mph in the same time it took to hit that speed.  Long story short those straps around your legs(being a guy doesn't help this situation) and shoulders grab you.  Then we slowly drifted to the ground.  It was peaceful.    I'm not a fan of heights.  In NYC I would look at the top of buildings and dizziness would come over me.  Still I would look to try and overcome this feeling.  Today I helped squash that fear of mine.  As we were drifting back to the airport I tried to replay what just happened and in all honesty couldn't believe what had just happened.  We landed nicely and now I proudly own a certificate saying I have skydived.  Skydiving didn't so much teach me anything, but it helped reiterate concepts/ideas that everyone should take with them.  Risks are worth taking.  We don't know the outcome unless we try go out and take that fateful step.  We have been given this amazing time on Earth, but why waste it doing something you despise? Go out on a ledge.  You can look down if you want, but in the end you need to look back up.  Life is in front of you, not in the past.  Jump.  Make everyone of your living dreams a reality.

      Life, filled with many questions.  Its the answers that are hard to come by.    I graduated this past Thursday.  I received another lamb skin, another sheet of paper saying that this young man is qualified.  Another diploma to be surrounded by mahogany showing, bragging about an accomplishment.  I am no longer a Ford trainee.  I am a 100% certified employee.  100% dissatisfied employee.  The class I have been training with for the last two months sat at tables wanting to eat not wanting to listen.  Like every graduation it is time where one must dress up, look interested, and unfortunately sit patiently as a speaker drones with words of wisdom that we have heard one too many times.  Sure enough, a middle aged balding man with a bad tie and a worst jacket went on to tell us his career path, the importance of a work life balance, and his respect for the company.  A company that I too still have much respect for.  He then went on to talk about office politics and said you better follow them.  You can't advance in this company if you don't get a grasp on these.  I appreciate his honesty.  I know office politics exist wherever you go, but to the degree they are present here is shocking.  I'm not a republican, democrat, elephant, or donkey.  I am an independent with the government and want to stay one at work too.    Still part of his speech made my ears perk up, "Make sure you like the job you're in.  Make sure you have a passion for what you do."  I hate my job, but love cars.  I hate direct sales, but love marketing.  So from the beginning I've been in a situation that leaves me queasy.  Should I work for a company that has wonderful benefits, great pay, and security or should I be like Robert Frost and take the path less traveled.  I'm leaning towards the latter.  Two and a half months isn't that long to develop an opinion, but it is a long time to do a lot of thinking about what I want in my life.  I will be leaving for the office soon, this may be the last weekend where I do such a thing.  I have more interviews in Dallas and an open in invitation in NYC.  My vacation days for the year have already been used, which that fact alone is sad.  Pursuing either one of these I will have to terminate my employment.  I won't be on the other side of some table facing a guy with a comb-over and his two henchmen waiting for those words "You're Fired."  I will be a white sheet of paper with 12 point Times New Roman font explaining my reasons for termination.  I will drop off the car, the laptop, and other items and say goodbye.    I've been raised to be a practical person.  Not having taken any drugs, carrying no credit card debt, and with only one speeding ticket my run ins with the cops have been kept to a minimal.  That's a good thing.  Still there is this internal battle that goes on, from what society expects from us and from what I except from life.  Society tells me to stay with Ford for it is the beginning of a career.  I want to live on a beach or the mountains, read some books, do a bit of volunteering, and do a lot of traveling.  That is not going to happen either, so now I need to find that happy medium.    This week I started talking to others about the job they are in.  Some of them received positions in the office as a market rep, event planner, or advertising coordinator.  They enjoy the work they do, they are not looking forward to the day where they have a zone such as mine and are on the road alone through their twenties.  I've started talking to the other zone managers and why I thought my opinion was rare turned out to be the opposite.  Others started opening up saying they doubt they will make it to years end, they wish they didn't sign a year lease, etc.  One thing we all wish was a better description of the job at hand.  No where was it explained to me that I would need to sell tires, no where was it said that in order for me to become promoted I would have to track body shop information.  More importantly when I placed my John Hancock on those papers did it show that Ford has a career path in mind for me.  A path in Ford Customer Service Division.  It's the luck of the draw or so they say.  Well because of that I might just take my short end of the straw, throw it to the ground and leave all of this behind.

      Death of a Salesman...  Moving to Detroit I brought almost every material item of mine.  TV, Computer, Bedding, clothing, and the list goes on.  What I still have a hard time understanding is why I brought a shovel.  Still there it is, leaning against the side on the cracked painted house of 1900 Brockton.  It's your typical shovel with a large wooden handle and a metal spade with dried dirt on it.  After the first week of training I went to our small back yard and broke the ground with it.  With a solid push it broke the surface.  Some grass turned over and small pile of dirt started to form.  Weeks would go on and a good size hole started to form.  The pile of dirt grew larger.    I haven't liked my job from day one.  Whenever I buy a new book it's safe to say I'm going to find a NYC bestseller.  Like most people I look at the cover, whatever grabs my attention.  However there have been some books I've read where the cover didn't intrigue me, but the story that resulted was one that never had dog eared corners.  I was constantly turning the pages.  I knew I couldn't judge a job by the first day or the first week.  Still, time doesn't stop, it moves on and so do we.  As time progressed my opinion held strong.  It did not waver, but like a flag in the wind was outstretched.  My head was telling me all the reasons I was unhappy.  Leaving friends, leaving family, leaving a lifestyle I was accustomed too.  Still now and then we need to stop listening to our head and listen with our hearts.  My heart beats regulary and much like the life sustaining beat it tells me day in day out that this isn't the place for me.  Maybe someday in the future my heart will say Detroit and the automotive industry.  In the meantime it is beating to a different rhythm.  A beat I can feel deep inside me, a beat that I am trying to find the source of.    Two months have passed here in the Midwest.  Two months of learning.  This coming weekend I am following my heart.  I am boarding a plane to Texas.  I am pursuing a different career.  There is a chance that I won't get hired.  A very likely chance and that is a fact that scares me right to my core.  I am confident in what I can achieve, yet sometimes no matter what effort we put in the results come out to our disliking.    In the meantime you can find me in the backyard digging.  Every passing day the guilt inside me grows.  Ford will recover the financial cost of one David John Hoffman or company id dhoffm38.  There have been co-workers who have effected my life and now ones I have effected.  There is a trust relationship.  A relationship in which great work is expected now and into the foreseable future.  I have started to measure my future in weeks and no longer the years that I thought moving here.  The guilt is crushing me.  The longer I stay the deeper the hole.  I've dug myself deep enough that it's becoming hard to see the top.  This metaphorical hole is now 6 feet deep.  While I'm not dead, this guilt is killing me.

      That random two digit number followed by a letter A through F.  It's a combination that gives you, a several hundred dollar paying customer a seat on a plane.  Will you be in the aisle, the window, or the middle/shit seat in-between?  Flying alone in high school with hormones a raging, my mind would only have one thought.  hot single girl, Hot Single Girl, HOT SINGLE GIRL.  Almost every time denied.  Few times I was fortunate, but alas shaggy blonde shy kid I was a high pitched squeak hi is all I could muster.  However there was one time the hour and a half flight was filled with conversation and hanging out for just a bit in Denver's terminal.  Now the only thought on my mind flying is nap time, Nap Time, NAP TIME.  Flying to NYC, I wasn't so fortunate.  Not to stereotype the Jewish population I was surrounded by the sect that wears those wide brimmed hats and have curly sideburns.  Three behind me, two to the left of me, and three in front of me.  I was a button downed blue shirt in a sea of white.  This white population didn't give off the best smell.  I would have switched seats, but the flight from where I was sitting looked full.    I have been on flights to exotic locals such as Ft. Lauderdale to London.  I have been on massive planes where two jet engines lie under each wing to a plane with a single propeller.  I've been fortunate and have flown first class and been on budget airlines where only if you're an amputee would there be enough leg room.  I've flown on AirTran, American, ATA, Continental, Delta, Easy Jet, Northwest, Ryan Air, Spirit, Southwest, and United.    What I've learned from flying on all these different planes is 99% no matter how little time you have to connect flights you'll make it.  If a plane is going to crash there is no way that little belt around your waist is going to save your life (you're in a 300mph fireball).  That when the plane finally docks there is no point to stand because it'll still take 20 minutes for them to open the door.  That lost luggage is truly a pain.  When flying with parents you can usually get them to buy you an overpriced meal at the airport.  Even though there are certain complaints with flying, that the four hour flight beats two days of driving any day.

      And Guest  Two simple words written on an invitation.  Two simple words that imply a lot more than the size 16 French Gothic font would have you believe.  You know that font, the one where when a T is crossed and the slashes on the F become all curvy.  Yesterday in the mail I received two such invitations, one for a wedding, and the other a party for a wedding.  I can't wait till I get married, you get more gifts than Christmas.  Due to my current position, i.e. unemployed, these are two additional functions that I will not be able to attend.  I wish I could, but the cost is too high for me to leave Detroit.    Still I look at the invitations with curiosity.  Who would I invite?  I don't know, maybe no one.  A guest can be a friend, but to me that G in guest is the same G as in girlfriend.  The older I become and still remain single the larger, the more looming it will be.  I will be hiding somewhere in its shadow.  You see, I can count all the girls I have dated on one hand.  If I was in a freak accident with a combine and lost a couple fingers on that hand I'd still to be able to use it for this counting purpose.  I know its ok to go to these functions single.  Still there it is on that little manila card, words that society has put more behind than I care for.  Then I realize what effort do I put in to change this situation?  None really.  Right now that is a good thing, no need for me to start a relationship here in Detroit.  In high school I was too immature to date.  I was also like 5 foot 4 through my junior year.  Thank God the pituitary gland kicked over.  Then college started and I did it.  Took those exams, rode the buses, went to sporting events, hung out, had some interests never pursued them.    When I do go to old roommates/best friends' weddings this summer the only guest I will be bringing is my smile.  For now, that is good enough for me.  Yes, this is a corny way to end the post, but I lost my train of thought about ten minutes ago.

      And back again...  Much like a Doctor's appointment, a second opinion can be useful.  I now have a different view of NYC than several days ago.  I like the place.  In fact I absolutely love the dynamics of this city.  Here is an island several miles long by one wide and yet with each ascending subway staircase your eyes gaze on new surroundings.  That there are many different neighborhoods from the very nice Upper East side to the not so nice Washington Heights, and then where the bell rings down at Wall Street.  Where walking down 5th Ave. it wouldn't be a surpise to see a celebrity (I saw John Mayer giving a free show and somewhere in Timesquare saw a film crew.)  Not your daily happenings in the other cities that dot the US.  But back to the idea of living there.  Not yet, not right now in my life.  I wouldn't mind being there with a good group of friends or perhaps even a spouse (long away here), but something else will be needed.  Moolah (who says that anymore), I'm going to need more than an entry level advertising salary.    It was Thursday night and I am sitting across from the son of the COO of Cintas.  Listening to his parents' new 14,000 sq. foot home and having college courses with Natalie Portman his growing up differs from mine.  Stories like those just don't happen in Detroit and College Station.  After a nice (i.e. expensive) dinner we headed to his girlfriend's apartment on the Upper West Side where upon the roof views of George Washington Bridge and some of that famous NYC skyline were lit up under a dark sky.  I fell in love again with this city.  I'll be back in a couple weeks for another date with her.  Another interview.  After a train ride it was back on the road to Detroit.  I decided I would take the longer route and see Niagra Falls.  I got there at night and luckily they shine spot lights on it.  I would have been dissappointed if all it came down was me hearing it's roar.  Back on the road I was deteremined to make it to Detroit. 1 AM rolls around and Detroit is bumped out for a hotel.  One didn't appear for 30 minutes.  A frightful thirty minutes as I was truly struggling to keep my eyes open.  Then we add the fact that its raining, my windshield has streaks, and now I'm not a happy camper.  Then there's those signs in kilometers.  I was missing America.  But I found a place to stay and dropped a decent amount of money.  I needed sleep and it was wonderful.    On the road these last few weeks I've seen amazing sights.  I wish I could have shared them with others. I wish that gas stops would be comedy breaks where we try on funny sunglasses and hats.  That when a guy without a shirt on and has a mullet for a haircut drives by that it isn't just a solitary smile on my face, but laughter that goes on for hours and a memory that is created.  I wish that instead of me singing to songs or analyzing the lyrics that stories would be exchanged.  Learning of other's pasts and their hopeful futures.  I'm sure I will have more such drives in the future.  A friend in the seat next to me would be better any day over the CD case.

      Here we go again....  With a suit on, bag over the shoulder, and tired eyes in a line next to many nameless individuals I am waiting for the 7:31 train into Grand Central Station.  New York City, truly a mecca for many industries, a city so different from many I have visited.  But lets take a step back, I'm in Connecticut right now.  I am surrounded by 1000 dollar suits and three pointed stars for hood ornaments.  This place is incredible.  At dinner I notice a table of good looking girls.  Me in a shirt from a thrift store and hair cut by a barber and not some fashion stylist on 5th Ave., I doubt I could get the time of day from them.  The size of my paycheck and closet are much too small for their liking.  Right on schedule its 8:58 and the train comes to slow stop.  Let the race begin.  We all get into line and head out the door up the steps and out into the streets.  We are here to make a living, provide for a family, and maybe make a difference in this world.  My first few steps are shaky, it's been two years since I've been to this land of concrete.  But like riding a bike it soon becomes second nature.  My pace quickens, and I make my way through the crowd.  I am now stepping on others and getting stepped on.  I'm hitting shoulders and not saying sorry.  I am being a New Yorker.  Unlike Connecticut, New York is a diverse city.  Truly a rainbow of people, where the characters are more interesting the landscape.  Speaking of landscapes here I was in NYC.  I saw the Chrysler, Empire, Flat Iron buildings and it wasn't the same.  My first time to NYC, I was in awe of this place.  Now, I'm like yep its one big city and sure does smell.  Stupid taxis honking their horns.  Do I want to live here?  Not at all.  I left Ford realizing money isn't everything.  I arrive to New York realizing it is something.  Gas is over 2.10 a gallon, a roundtrip train ride cost me $26, and lunch, merely a quesidilla and a water at your average cafe was about $10.  This is one expensive city.  Two bucks a gallon, well its NYC, you don't need a car.  It's weird and interesting at the same time how everything you need is in walking distance.  How if you owned a car here it wouldn't be a luxury, but an inconveince.  The largest city in the US for me feels like the loneliest.  That would change in time as I met co-workers and others, but thats not then, this is now.  I am holding onto a subway handle, as to not fall into the others crowded around me.  4 years ago I went to Detroit with my Dad.  He took me the North American International Auto Show.  That was when I got my first taste of Detroit, I didn't like it then, but it brought me back.  Now only to spit me out once again.  Still I was there in hopes of talking to various people to see if they could provide insight on how to be hired.  I was nervous and had no confidence in myself.  Now I am sitting down with a headhunter somewhere between Park and Broadway on my own with out my Dad holding my hand.  I want a job, I might need help, but this is my own doing.  I'm somewhere off of Madison avenue speaking to a HR director of one the most prestigous advertising agencies not in the US, but the world.  Ask me a question, I'll answer it without second guessing.   A day ago I received a call stating I will not be selected for a position.  Dave Hoffman couple years ago would shrug his shoulders, oh well, guess it's not for me.  That Dave not wanting to break his comfort shell.  Now how about you give me a few minutes of your time and tell me how I can improve and in the process (in a nice professional manner of couse)  try to overcome your objections.  This weekend I will make the drive back to Detroit and most likely will still remain unemployed.  I've talked to my mom's cousin here in Connecticut and fortunately has provided much advice.  His daughters have received top notch educations.  Top notch, try Harvard and Saint Josephs, and are still unemployed.  This a tough market.  The last three months I've never been more depressed in my life and when you live in a 10x10 room in a basement with hardly any light from outside your outlook is hard pressed to be changed.  I'm going to do a lot of thinking these next few weeks.  I don't know what is going to happen, and slowly, very slowly actually, I am starting to realize that's ok.  Random things about my 11 hour drive 1. I-80 through Pennslyvannia is beautiful.  I want to see when the leaves change to the vibrant reds, oranges, yellows... 2. It seems where ever I go I have free hookups(places to stay) that I don't even realize till I leave 3. I absolutely love music 4. I love it so much that on these distances to entertain myself I will sing various songs with different accents.  11 hours behind a steering wheel is a long time. 5.  That I now don't believe in speed limits, I believe going the flow of traffic.  That being said New Jersey and New York provided some exciting times. 6.  That my mind often jumps from wanting to live by old college friends to trying to grasp the fact that even I did, it won't last forever so why start now. 7. That I think a lot.  There are some people right now I truly miss not having in my life.

      5 O'clock shadow and a couple slices of bread.  The life of being a twenty something and unemployed.  It's not the glamorous lifestyle of wasting time at the mall, eating out, hanging with friends, and week long vacations that we all hope it would be.  It's actually consists of countless hours searching the web for that perfect place of employment.  I went to Barnes and Noble and luckily there on the magazine rack shining like a beacon of hope was the one issue of Advertising Age I needed.  The one that comes out only once a year that lists all the agencies in the US.  I've spent most the days going to their respective websites where either an online form or email address is listed.  Then to my delight I get an automatically generated email that if you read between the lines states, "There are more qualified people and even if there is not we will only be interviewing people that are recommended to us.  So if you aren't a relative or a friend of a friend then please admire our present portfolio on www.ouragency.com and best of luck to you schmuck."  I then go to Monster.com where now and then a good position is posted.  Go ahead, be a Monster.  If I'm unemployed by the end of this month, you don't want to see the monster I'll become.    Now my day isn't filled with countless hours of TV, or reading a good book, it consists of this machine I am typing on now and the same mp3's playing over and over and over.  I am confident I will land a job, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit worried either.  I've almost exhausted my resources and now it's coming up to sit and wait.  Something in Texas should work out, but just as life is, nothing is a given.  I head to NYC next week for an interview.  A week ago I was stoked, I get to go back to the city of my most incredible summer.  Now I look at it as one huge expense.  X amount for airfare, X amount for taxi rides, X amount for food, X amount for getting pickpocketed.  Which sums up to a whole lot of cash that I don't have.  Unemployment isn't just a bottomless void of negative thoughts, technically I could sleep in.  Sleeping in for me though is 7:30, but I have to admit that is another two hours of blissful sleep I didn't get a month ago.  I don't have to shave which is something I really do like.  Funny thing and a thing I just don't get my facial hair is red.  Real read, just bizarre.     Living in Motown, a city that needs more town.  Maybe in several weeks I'll be able to call this place: Leavingtown, Hopetoneverhavetolivehereagaintown, and the list goes on.

      City Slickers is a good movie.  I don't know if many of you remember this early 90?s classic, but a character crossed my mind on the drive back to Detroit.  I don't remember the words or how it was even phrased, but Jack Pallance the old cowboy basically said life is about one thing and would raise his finger in the air.  Billy Crystal through his trials and tribulations would discover what this one thing was to him.  This one thing is your life.  You get this moment, blink of an eye quick stay here on Earth.  It is up to us to make the most out of it.  We live in a society where we try to push blame.  It's our job, its issues with family or friends, it's where we are in life.  Believe it or not, these are things we can have direct control of.  There are two modes of thought, one using our head and the other using our heart.  Unfortunately they usually are in conflict with one another.  One is practical and the other is that romanticism that lies in all of us often being ignored.  Our heart tells us what we want to hear, but our brain tells us what we should do and we follow.  I believe people think that this gray mass only provides answers at the beginning.  However, it?s not going anywhere that we don?t.  So follow your heart, our head will still be there to put the pieces together.    Case in point, I recently quit my job.  Was it a wise decision? Honestly, the answer is no.  I am now unemployed, don't have another job lined up, and as my parents continue to reference don't have medical insurance.  My head shaking no to the question with fury.  Another question needs to be asked, was it a good decision?  Absolutely, my heart answers beating strongly.  I was not happy with the type of work I was doing and would be stuck in the position for several years.  I am now happy and the pressure of the job now weighs on Ford and no longer my shoulders.  Of course there is a part of me that is concerned about being unemployed, but this is where my head comes in again.  I have a good one on my shoulders and it has helped me in the past and will continue to do so.   My Mom used to or I should say still does say to me before I leave on a trip or adventure, "Dave you get one life.  Don't waste it, be careful."  I agree with the first part, we don?t see eye to eye on the second.  I have gone skiing out of bounds now multiple times.  I was truly living.  I hitchhiked with friends in Seattle.  I was truly living.  I rode the subways at 3am in NYC alone.  I was truly living.  I jumped out of a plane.  I was truly living.  I take these risks and never look back.  If I was to die tomorrow I can actually say I lived an amazing life.  I don't want to grow old and be bitter about my past.  I don't want to grow old either and only reminisce.  I want to continually look ahead, I want to continually live this one life.  This one thing.

      I've heard it a thousand times from a thousand different people.  Don't worry it just means there is something else better out there.  There's a picture that neither I nor you can fully see at this point in time.  I'll give credit to my friends and family, there very well may be some truth to this.  I believe some things are meant to happen if only to teach us a lesson or help us appreciate life a bit more.  At the same time, I still like to hold onto the fact that we have a lot of control over our life.  God didn't tell me to quit Ford, my personal dissatisfaction did.  God didn't prevent me from landing one of the advertising positions I interviewed for.  The account directors and managers sitting across from those brown tables did.    Is there something better out there?  I would like to hope so.  I believe there are two reasons why people say this.  The first will be demonstrated by a conversation about being denied a position:  ME:  "Hey Dad, well I just got the call back.  It looks like they are going to offer the position to someone else." DAD:  "That's too bad son.  Well you better go apply to McDonalds because from here on out you are going to have one shitty life.  I just don't think things are going to get better."  A make-believe conversation of course, but if people were to tell you there wasn't something better then you would only slip further into depression.  The reason people say this is to try and cheer someone's spirits.  It's the same as saying rain on your wedding day is good luck.  No it's not, it's the opposite and people know this.  They just say this to comfort the newlyweds.  Then we can look at it from another angle.  Technically it is possible.  If I won the 10 million lottery, what would be better than that?  The 100 Mega Millions of course.  I get married to a girl on welfare, but am truly in love.  Love is pretty incredible, but it would be all the better if she happened to be a trust fund baby.  The cure for cancer.  Wonderful, now the same doctor finds cures for HIV, diabetes, and MS.  Now I'm not trying to be over pessimistic here.  I'm actually in much better spirits after my rejection than I thought I would be.  Again I have this blank canvas, clean state to start working on.  I have an opportunity to start a new journey.  I'm no Dorothy with a path of gold laid out in front of me.  This road will have it share of pot holes and detours, but it will be those obstacles that develop my character and will only make me stronger.

      Facts  1.	The heart beats approximately 100,000 times in one day, 35 million times in a  year,   and during an average lifetime, beats more than 2.5 billion times.  2.	The aorta, the largest artery is almost the diameter of a garden hose 3.	The human body has 6 quarts of blood. This blood circulates through the body three times every minute. In one day, the blood travels a total of 12,000 miles, that's four times the distance across the US from coast to coast. 4.	The heart pumps about 1 million barrels of blood during an average lifetime--enough to fill more than 3 super tankers.   What's more amazing about this muscle is all the stress that it is put through.  It beats to sustain life, it beats so that we may wake up everyday to take on the world.  While the above facts are interesting in their own right, there are other aspects of the human heart that never cease to amaze me.  We describe people using the word heart.  That guy sure is cold hearted, or she wears her heart on her sleeve.    This pulsating organ we rely on daily can surprise us with skipping a beat.  From a friend sneaking up behind you or looking between your skis on a chairlift and the run you are about to face, your heart stops for a split second.  Taking your breath away at the same time.    Discomfort can be connected to our heart and I'm not talking about the burn that can be cured by the pink bottle.  There is heart ache that no liquid or tablets can over come.  The reason for such pain differs from individual to individual: lost of a loved one, the breaking off of a relationship, or a flight back to Detroit.  Tomorrow I learn of my status on a job I desperately want.  This is the first time I have truly wanted a position.  I've interviewed with companies before and now after graduation, however I have never been as concerned about a position as I am now.  Chances of getting it, well technically 20% since I am 1 out of 5 they interviewed.  After receiving positive feedback and feeling confident I felt certain this position was to be mine.  Now I am trying to be realistic, and grasp the fact that there are things I have no control over such as more qualified candidates.  However it doesn't hide the fact that I want this job.  The desire penetrating all the way to my core, my heart.

      Since as far as I can go back they have always been present.&nbsp; Whether we can dot our i's and cross our t's or multiply without a calculator.&nbsp; Later on the IOWA basics become a once year deal.&nbsp; These mundane tests are then replaced with every highschooler's favorite bubble sheet, the SAT.&nbsp; The test that comes with so much built in anxiety.&nbsp; Burger flipper or College, determined by shaded in A's, B's, C's, and D's.&nbsp; I was able to go to&nbsp;the former, where the word test is erased from our vocabulary and replaced with the much more threatening exam term.&nbsp; Senior year rolls around and there are two main options to choose from: more education (grad, law, medical) or real world.&nbsp; Now the more education comes with tests that make sure we know where the hypotenuse lies on a triangle and to make sure our vocabulary is up to the&nbsp;Scrabble dominating level.&nbsp; These tests go by the name of GMAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT....&nbsp;   I chose the other route, the Real World.&nbsp; No lavish 3 story house in exciting cities or on the beach with roommates that become horny with the sight of a camera.&nbsp; Basement, Detroit, 80 hour work weeks.&nbsp; In retrospect it's good that I started there.&nbsp; I can only move up and I did.&nbsp; One bedroom apartment in Connecticut.&nbsp; From the outside things look better, but my life is more like a Monet than a Rembrandt.&nbsp; Get close to the&nbsp;painting and you soon realize my life isn't so clear.&nbsp;   I propose there should be a federal mandate making sure all college graduates are prepared for the real world.&nbsp;  Question 1: Are you willing to work for the next 40 years.....Hmmm thats a tough one  Question 2: True or false, at the young age of 23 should you plan for retirement?&nbsp; Sadly enough this is true and I'm starting to learn more about Roth IRA's and 401k's (I diversified in 5 mutual funds I researched on my own).&nbsp; 5 Mutual funds that the Ipod I want will have to wait another day.&nbsp; Day, no more like a few months from now.  Question 3: Can you really cook?&nbsp; Now this is a trick question.&nbsp; Yes we all can cook, some better than others (I'm an other). But after working from 8-6, do we want to.&nbsp; Hell no, we want to sit on that couch and watch reruns of Ross and Rachel, even though we know the outcome of those Friends.  Question 4: Are you sure you are&nbsp;ready to live alone?&nbsp; Cleaning up after roommates, having to wait for washers, showers, and stovetops the answer would seem obvious.&nbsp; Setting down the laptop bag on the counter and looking at my empty surrounding I wouldn't mind the hassle.  This and many more questions should have been asked upon graduation.&nbsp; Still even if it was laid out in front of us on 8x11 paper with a staple in the upper left hand corner we wouldn't know what to write.&nbsp; The experience is where the learning comes from.  Here I am with feelings much like in February.&nbsp; Yearning for friends, family, and a job I liked.&nbsp; It's not all gloomy.&nbsp; I've learned things take time and that happiness doesn't come in a Fed Ex envelope.&nbsp; It goes the oversea route aboard a ship.&nbsp; It can be rough and take time, but thats when you grab life by the horns and hold on.

      Detroit In the Rear View Mirror  What can I say?  Quite a bit.  My six month stint here has taught me so much about myself and what I want in life.  I've learned about sacrifices to never forget your gloves in February.  I lived like a person in The Real World without the extravagant house.  The cast composed of roommates with differences in gender, race, sexual preferences, and backgrounds (none in which involved keeping a house clean).  I want to keep this post short.  Detroit was an experience and one I learned from.  It was real.  It was fun.  But it wasn't real fun

      Today I started packing.  Where you get to try and find boxes all over town just to realize that they aren't large enough.  Where you go through a roll of tape about every minute.  Not necessarily because of closing up boxes but more importantly because it keeps sticking to itself or you.  In college we learn the art of moving.  We can fit a whole room into a four door car and still find room for food from a pick up window.  Who needs to see through the rear view mirrors anyways? We move from home to dorm, back to home, to a different dorm, to apartment, to place of internship, and the list goes on.  We become professionals and have a better understanding how to fit shirts, CDs, towels, and DVDs in a box more than what we learned in class the previous sememster.  Graduation rolls around and we grab our lambskins, say our goodbyes, and pack up a U-haul one more time.  When packing we realize there will be times in the future where we will move again, but it is our hopes that it is now kept to a minimal.  Next week I pack one more time, this time it will be longer.  I've actually signed a 15 month lease and am more committed by acquiring such state documents like drivers license and tags.  I have setup utilities under my name and will be a customer to a new bank.  Connecticut for life is not the likely outcome, but then again who knows where I'll end up.  My mindset now is the one I wish I had back in December.  I have wondered if I was to go back in time would this outcome have been different.  I can say the result would have been the same.  It's through these trials and tribulations that we discover our path and gain some insight in the process.  After tub after tub of clothes (while having too many I'm too reluctant to let any go) I came across the drawer.  The photo drawer.  Its filled with envelopes, but not the one with a stamp on the upper right hand corner of a duck or American flag.  They are yellow, green, white, and blue and are from friends such as Eckerds, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart.  Inside these envelopes is a key to a time machine that takes me back a few months to several years.  Surprisingly the thought of modern travel came across my mind.  Before 1900 you lived close or with your family.  Mass transportation was just beginning to take shape with the locomotive and decades later concrete snakes would span across this great nation due to the automobile.  You might have wanted to leave town and establish roots elsewhere, but you would never have been too far from home.  At 23 I am now about to live in my fifth state.  I am thousands of miles away from the people who have given me guidance and helped shape the person I am today.  A century ago I would have been a horse ride away.    I received an email from my sister out in Idaho.  Attached were my photos of my niece Emma and nephew Bennett.  Emma is darling or so I hear.  I've seen her only a few times and while she was a beautiful baby I haven't seen her walk or seen her bubbly personality that I hear about.  Bennett the newest addition is a child I haven't even seen and can only wonder when.  I can only wish the best and for now I will see them through pictures.    "There was nothing in the world  that I ever wanted more than to never feel the breaking apart. All my pictures of you." ~ The Cure

      Those words that bring about a groan from a Mom and the white knuckle grip on the steering wheel from Pop. Whether its off to see the Grand Canyon or visit everyone's favorite cartoon character Mickey Mouse, we've been there, we've heard those words, and we've said them. What I've come to realize is that we still say them, just the manner and words are different.  Our voices rise with anger and yet in this not so pleasant tone we say "I'm not yelling." We act as children, which is disappointing because children are at least innocent and have been exposed to so little. We push the problem. We throw it away like a fastball. We package it in a box covered with duct tape with no return address, hoping it never finds the way back to the source. Finds the way back into our arms.  Recently I've had an ongoing problem with receiving my washer and dryer from Sears. It's been going on for almost four weeks. What lies in my living room is one large box, but more importantly what I might consider the greatest appliance of all time. Tomorrow it is to be setup. Through this ordeal I talked to the Genes, Karens, and Deborahs of the call center world dotted throughout our country. I've dealt with employees at the physical store to management at our apartment. And in my putting together this puzzle (I'd like to substitute headache for puzzle) the root cause was never clearly determined. One person felt it was another, which obliviously then had a corresponding 800 Number where I would get to make my own jingle by punching in various buttons from a touch tone phone.  No one wants to be at fault. Including myself. We hate to be wrong. We like to think that we have the answers and we like to think that we aren't stubborn because of this. We do have the answers, but from time to time they aren't the right ones. We complain about environmental problems and drive our SUVs. The nation as a whole is not behind our President. Maybe its the situation in Iraq, his stance on gay marriage, or that he can't pronounce nuclear. If the economy was how it was in the late 1990's Mr. Potato would do just as fine behind the podium. Sorry, Mr. Gore I meant Potatoe (I found out it was Quayle who said this, but then it takes away from the joke). Instead we stand behind a man who cheated on his wife and then lied to us.  People need to understand its ok to be wrong. It's ok to make mistakes. You make a mistake, you learn. You fall down you learn how to regain your balance. You dont touch your sister, because Dad very well might turn the minivan right around.
