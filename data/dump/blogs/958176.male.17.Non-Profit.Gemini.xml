      Lindsey, We're 14, not thirteen. We're actually more mature then most girls our age. We're NOT drama Queens. YOU did say something and the qoute, 'Hello?! She's ruining one of my bestfriend's life and you expect me to stand here and do nothing?!' Yea, who ever said this, Yea, YOU said this, and Yea, *I* nor Leigh-Anne made it up. Yea, I'm the other girl on the phone, I'm sorry, but are we a level to be stooped upon just because of our age and grade level? That's pretty shallow. Leigh Anne's not mad at Rosie, nor at anyone, but i'm angry because of this, I did NOTHING. I was protecting my friend. I have dislike for you already Lindsey, but im not about to go off being a bitch about it all because I can't do that in here. Anywho I'm out of here.  Lily The Psycho Powered Goddess

      Just for the record... Rosie nor I said anything to Leigh Anne or whoever was on the phone.  We just said hello and they kinda took it from there because they asked where you were and I said you were in the bathroom.  I don't know where they got everything else.  All thirteen year olds are drama queens cuz they want their lives to be interesting and its not.  Sorry if she cried; she brought it upon herself.  And you don't help it much by tolerating her controling you're life.  But I'll stay out of it.  No more advice, etc.  Bye, Josh.  See You Monday.  If you want to get mad, fine.  If you want to sink to their level, that's cool.  Just don't bring it out on the DI team.  Oh, and we're about as happy with you as you are with us.

      Ok, some ground rules...  Any of my invited people who check the team roster will see some people that they probably have conflict with...so no conflict or I kick you. I might just kick all of you anyway, nothing personal, I was sort of planning for this to be just mine, I put all of you on in a mini-fit.   And now to the problem.  People are fucking retarded. SURPRISE! Look at the name of my BLog for God's sake.  I don't want to understand anything anymore, I'm getting sick of that shit. Understand  me ! Understand why the fuck I get pissed off so fucking quick. Of course nobody will, I'm supposed to understand first. And that shit doesn't make sense. That is so gay.  Everything is so gay.  I swear to God, she is pissing me off. AGGGGGGHHH. I wish she wasn't, too.   Dirt  by Alice in Chains  I have never felt such Frusteration or lack of self-control I want you to kill me And dig me under I wanna live no more  One who doesn't care is One who shouldn't be I try to hide myself from what is wrong for me For me  I want to taste dirty A stinging pistol In my mouth, on my tongue I want you to scrape me From the wall, and go crazy Like you made me  One who doesn't care is One who shouldn't be I try to hide myself from what is wrong for me One who doesn't care is One who shouldn't be I try to hide myself from what is wrong for me For me  You, you weren't so special You have the talent To make me feel like dirt You, you use your talent To dig me under And cover me with dirt  One who doesn't care is One who shouldn't be I try to hide myself from what is wrong for me One who doesn't care is One who shouldn't be I try to hide myself from what is wrong for me For me

      Um well...  There was another classic example of me misreading a girl. She was all mad because she thought I was going out with Lindsey, and I guess she thought we were ok, or something...  As the last part of the history said on my woebegone Tin Haven, "the present has a lot of potential", and it does...it's really weird.   I'm not saying it's all better. I'm just saying it's not worse.  This settles a lot of things with me, faith mostly, I've prayed a long time for something to turn out right, and perhaps I'm getting a second chance.  Maybe I'm luckier than I thought.

      Posted in Kenzie's BLog about five minutes prior:  Hiya Kenzie, guess what fucking happened....  First, this is the new secret  urlLink BLog . Tin Haven got deleted by Leigh Anne, and you'll see why in the rest of this post. Second of all, some shit happened. My friends had my cell at that DI meeting, Leigh Anne called and kept calling. At one point, I went to the bathroom, they said something  really  horrible to her, she started crying.   I think she hates me now...after everything, after I ALMOST fucking had it.  "I love you" she said last night. I was able to make her laugh for hours, I was able to do it all. I was perfect. And now this shit, and Leigh Anne's taking it out on me for shit they said.   It  amazes  me how pathetic my luck is. I just really want to take everyone I've met this year, all my friends and everything, and scream at them til I lose my voice, sleep it off, and do it all over again until I choke on blood and die. I really cannot believe how much my friends want me to die, thinking they're doing the "good deed" for me by ruining things with Leigh Anne. She's hurt me a lot, but these things are in the past, gone forever, I can forget about that weakness I had, I can forget the depression, but somehow the scars it created seem to come back and haunt me, the scars surface and they never forget how I treated people when  I  was in darkness.  Somehow it's fine for Leigh Anne to take everything out on me, when I have a bad day. If something bad happens to her, like she said, "If you knew what happened to me today you'd know that I really don't need this (being cussed out/whatever happened by Lindsey and Rosie at the meeting)", then NOTHING ELSE bad can happen. Even if it's not me but my friends. I'm supposed to take responsibility for my actions, like it's all my goddammed fault. Why is that, Kenzie? Why is it that she can only see the bad in me when we're not together, and she only sees the good when she's at her worst, and I'm at my best.  At some point, her and Lily put down the phone. I've been sitting here, waiting, listening to the silence, for the past hour and fifteen minutes for someone to pick up, because I want to sort this out and get on with it.  I FUCKING CANNOT BELIEVE MY LUCK. I CANNOT. GODDAMN.  Will something please turn out right and stay that way, please? Give me just one grant God, universe, nature, any-fucking-one, listen to my soul screaming and give me this.  The time for sadness is over.  And anger is in season.

      Welcome to the new secret BLog...  I can't believe I'd ever need another one. I can't believe my luck, it's incredible.   Incredibly fucked.  Tin Haven was deleted by Leigh Anne in a fit of anger, goodbye Tin Haven. It doesn't matter.  For now, I want to post all that happened in Kenzie's BLog. I'll put it here eventually. It just seems like I'm talking to Kenzie when I do it, and it's a lot easier than feeling like I'm talking to no one here.  Welcome to Antiphilanthropy, down with this wastrel existence.

      It's been a pretty nothing-doing day.  I played Counterstrike/was on the phone with Alex most of the day, I lost pathetically and was consequently made fun of. But who cares, the game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy too real, and  games  that focus on reality aren't even worth playing. Call me a n00b if you must, since I am, but I just like games that take the emphasis off of "get shot=dead" and more on "get shot a few times=use god powerup=RESURRECTION=get shot a few more times=run like hell using speed powerup=get hit by opponent's gun powerup=dead". Yeah, y'all get the idea.  I listened to POOR BASTARD all the way through,  Died  is a little mest in the middle, I probably won't reburn it though, it took forever to get all those songs together, and a little blip in the midst of the song isn't gonna change anything major.  Ugh, my earring ear is bleeding and dripping all over the place, heh. I felt a few drops on my shoulder just now and I was like, "Agh, ceiling's leaking freon or something" and then noticed the remarkable scarlet hue.  And Happy Chinese New Year all, I hope you're all enjoying the year of Yog-Soggoth......I mean, the Goat.  Because  I  am tired for some reason, caffeine overload.  Happyhappyjoyjoy.

      I remember that time I had mono, it was in seventh grade.  I remember I was at my dad's and one day there was a storm. My mom and sister came over and sat with me. I was running a berserk fever, 106 or something, she was putting a rag on my head and I was screaming at the top of my lungs. I started hallucinating at the storm, it scared the shit out of me, I threw off the blanket, I got cold, I put it back on, it was making me sweat, over and over again. I stepped outside for a while and felt good, and then it started to rain and they were afraid of me getting pneumonia so I got dragged back inside. Plus I was cold again. I shook like I'd never thought possible, trembling from head to toe, and painfully, no less.  And when it was over, it was over. I woke up one day and it was completely gone. But I was really weak for a long time, and I lost a lot of weight, like 20 or so pounds.  POOR BASTARD is the CD based off of songs that have influenced my thought over the past six months, some of which have been posted in Tin Haven or Bad Vision. And I just burned the CD so copies for everyone.  I dunno where she is, gone I guess.  And with that, the beginning lines of a new, and soon to be famous post. There was the "dark marks" one, there was the "thank you for being there" one, there was the very cryptic one at the end of November, "I'm not at liberty to say what happened, but just know that I am really confused right now,". I sounded like a child there. And now, this...  Is anyone out there? Is there anything good at all?  Because lately it seems that even the best made tapestries have to unwind, all the metals will rust, everything is going to die even as it lives and lives after its death.   It seems like some big cosmic trick, that somethings never last..."somethings never last they tell me, sometimes lies are what we are" I wrote for no reason once, and now it's beginning to take shape.  Everything I've ever written, no matter how inconsequential at the time, has come to being, has become reality, the feeling from the song takes substance and becomes my life, not just because I am hearing the song, but that the world is affecting it all, making it all spring to being, and the subject matter in the song becomes true.   My Solution  was the start of it, the feeling of cagedness, I tried to off myself once, I left it to fate. It was just after I wrote the song, I had my dad's pistol, I put it to my temple, I pulled the trigger.  And fate said, "CLICK", and no more. And since I have never thought of suicide as an alternative to ANY situation, because that is NOT the end of the road. Things didn't work out with Leigh Anne and me, and they really aren't right now, but that's no reason to make myself dead, because if I am, what can I do about the situation? What is the point in creating my death? To end pain? And then what, when the immortal soul carries on, I still live with that pain, but then, it multiplies because there is nothing that can be done for me, I am dead, and the living care not for the haunts of the dead.  So the points so far...somehow, I have known what was going to happen to me through my songs, and that suicide is no longer my option. I remember where I was going before this now...  The other songs have really come to be after that,  Bitter  was rewritten using the term "sunshine"; Leigh Anne referred to herself as "an undiluted ray of sunshine" thereafter, and the first lines of  Bitter : "Where did my sunshine go, I think it's ever-fade". I wasn't taken aback. The others songs have come true, why shouldn't this one take substance in some manner or another?  Red Flowers  came true,  Shut Up  came true.  Veil  came true, and still is. All the songs have come to life to haunt me. It's like harnessing a demon, the demon takes his toll eventually.  And unfortunately, all the songs have no semblance of hope, they only portend anger and fear, sorrow and the end of a dream, of a life, of a history.   The only hope I have is in the earliest version of the song  Oh Morose , because in that I was finally standing with myself, not trying to pick up the pieces of myself. And in the new one, it's about being beaten down by my devils...and it's already happened.  What the hell am I trying to say...   Is  there any semblance of good, of change, of things taking a good discourse from the norm?  Because the worst is reaching a brand new low for me now, and at the same time I am numb. Why?  What happened to me, shouldn't I be sad that I can feel misery?  But I answer, there is no misery left for myself, that is not the way to go.  In a way things are better, in myself they are better, and outside they are getting worse.  The winds of change are blowing again.  And my book grows thin of these pages.

      Ok, I'm WAY behind.  First, what the hell is poor bastard???  I HATE BEING SICK!!!  Rosie & Z, I don't fit the mold- I'm in all those "classes" that Rosie hates, even the prep & popular ones to an extent because they're all my middle school friends.  Not that I'm perceived to be in these groups by onlookers, but I'm there, just the same, whether I want to be or not.  Yall are my real group though.  Anyway, I MISS YALL!!!  And where's Lily lately?  I haven't gotten in my weekly bitch moment this week, and Lord only knows I need one (I'm just kidding.  I'm not really a mean person  Josh will even back me up on that one.)  I'll see you guys later.  Apparently I'll end up in the hospital if I don't go to bed RIGHT NOW.  God, mono sucks.

      POOR BASTARD LYRICS   Blood Brothers  by Papa Roach  Watch your back because the next man is comin' And you don't know if the next man is dumbin' Survival of the fit is what it is I got your back you got my back and that's the biz Blood is rushing through my veins I got the power Channel the energy and with my strength I will devour Sickening thoughts are running through my head That's when I realized I'm glad I'm not dead  Corruption and abuse The salesmen of our blood For the public's craving Existence in the dark  It's in our nature to destroy ourselves It's in our nature to kill ourselves It's in our nature to kill each other It's in our nature to kill kill kill  It was a dream and then it hit me, reality struck And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast Close to a buck fifty, we all stand strong In respect to the family in the times of Enemity, and through world of profanity I describe my dysfunction family Blood brothers keep it real til the end Deeper than the thought you think, not a trend  Corruption and abuse  The salesmen of our blood For the public's craving Existence in the dark  It's in our nature to destroy ourselves It's in our nature to kill ourselves It's in our nature to kill each other It's in our nature to kill kill kill It's in our nature to destroy ourselves It's in our nature to kill ourselves It's in our nature to kill each other It's in our nature to kill kill kill Again and again  Corruption and abuse The salesmen of our blood For the public's craving Existence in the dark  It's in our nature to destroy ourselves It's in our nature to kill ourselves It's in our nature to kill each other It's in our nature to kill kill kill kill kill Kill kill kill kill kill Kill kill kill kill kill Kill kill kill kill kill Kill kill kill  It's in our nature to destroy ourselves It's in our nature to kill ourselves It's in our nature to kill each other It's in our nature to kill    Pertinence  : The theme song of Tin Haven, of Rosie's depression fits, and my love life. The chorus says it all, "it's in our nature to kill ourselves". First utilized in a fit of extreme anger.    Hey Jealousy  by Gin Blossoms  Tell me do you think it'd be alright If I could just crash here tonight You see I'm in no shape for driving Anyway I've got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I ever had If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around  The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy Hey jealousy, hey jealousy, hey jealousy  And you can judge me not to think And not to sleep around And if you don't expect too much from me You might not be let down Cuz all I really want's to be with you Feeling like I matter too If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy Hey jealousy, hey jealousy, hey jealousy  Tell me do you think it'd be alright If I could just crash here tonight You see I'm in no shape for driving Anyway I got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I ever had If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy  Hey jealousy Well she took my heart There's only one thing I couldn't start    Pertinence  : Firstly, the Blossoms put me in a good mood all the time, and secondly, the line "If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might be here with you" applied to my struggles with Leigh Anne, thinking that I was an asshole before and that's why she hated me now.    Sorrowful Farewell  by Rotting Christ  Counting the time Waiting for the crime A loss of innocence A faint reminiscence I am into a light Surrounded by the night Their memory's been disgraced The scene is still unchanged  I praise the song of defeat I am the bottom, and he's the summit A sorrowful farewell Where does salvation, does salvation dwell?  I keep still I'm trying to feel The hate that's within you I'm going to win you I was mistaken I was forgotten Unbroken silence Absolute violence  I praise the song of defeat I am the bottom and he's the summit A sorrowful farewell Where does salvation, does salvation dwell?  The time is near The message is clear The battle will be fought Fight now, fear not  Counting the time Waiting for the crime A loss of innocence A faint reminiscence I am into a light Surrounded by the night Their memory's been disgraced The scene is still unchanged  I praise the song of defeat I am the bottom and he's the summit A sorrowful farewell Where does salvation, does salvation dwell?    Pertinence  : It was mostly a rocking song and I needed one badly at the time. The vocals suck ass, but they really preached to my anger. Also, the line "I am the bottom and he's the summit", probably a reference to some demon in this case, spoke to me as, "this is what you are, that is what you could be, this is how you can get there, and this is what it's going to take".   For Whom The Bell Tolls  by Metallica  Make his fight on the hill in the early day Constant chill deep inside Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey On they fight, for they're right? Yes, but who's to say For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know Stiffened wounds test their pride Men of five still alive through the raging glow Gone insane from this pain that they surely know  For whom the bell tolls Time marches on For whom the bell tolls  Take a look to the sky just before you die It's the last time you will Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery Hears the silence so loud Crack of dawn all is gone, except the will to be Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see  For whom the bell tolls  Time marches on For whom the bell tolls    Pertinence  : None, really. I picked up  Ride the Lightning  at the middle/end of December, and listened to it again, it reminded of the severe but serene loneliness I had when I first started listening to Metallica, so what A GREAT IDEA listening to music that depresses us. YES.    All I Want  by Toad the Wet Sprocket  Nothing's so loud As hearing when we lie Truth is not kind And you said neither am I And the air outside so soft Is saying everything Everything  All I want is to feel this way To be this close, to feel the same All I want is to feel this way The evening speaks, I feel insane  Nothing so cold As closing hard when all we need is To free this hole But we wouldn't be that brave I know  And the air outside so soft Confessing everything Everything  All I want is to feel this way To be this close, to feel the same All I want is to feel this way The evening speaks, I feel insane  And it won't matter now Whatever happens will be For the air speaks of all we'll never be You won't trouble me  All I want is to feel this way To be this close, to feel the same All I want is to feel this way The evening speaks I feel insane To feel so close Let it take me in Let it hold me so I can feel insane    Pertinence  : One of the few songs I think as beautiful, this song. It's haunting. I listened to it a long time ago, picked it up again in mid-December. And "You won't trouble me" was my favorite line when I started listening to it again, guess why...    Hold Me Down  by Gin Blossoms  So I guess I must have just been dreaming  When I thought I heard myself say no  Anyway it looks like no one heard me  So here I go  Cause when you're in the company of strangers Or just the strangers you call friends  You know before you start just how it's  Going to end   When the doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around  Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down   I can't remember why I like this feeling  When it only seems to let me down  Soon I find I'm searching for the exit  From the ground  If I think the room is turning faster  Then I think the music is too loud  By then I've lived another broken story  To let me down   When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around  When half the party moves into the bathroom  Hold me down  Or if you're at the tail end of the evening  And Dr. Feelgood comes around  Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down   Down if I want that part  Down if I've gone too far   Well I guess I must have just been reeling  When I felt myself begin to fall I realize I'm bounding down the hallways  And off the walls  If my bed was standing in the corner  I could just fall into it right now  And know that I'd just be staring at the ceiling  Going round   When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around  Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down  Down if I want that part Down if I've gone too far    Pertinence  : It's a happy song about drinking and partying. That's why it's so great. Picked up about the end of November, along with  Lost Horizons  and  Until I Fall Away .    Poem  by Taproot  Overbearing panic attack Entrenching my veins In an hour I'll be ok And pray this pain will go away Permanently someday  I've seen more than I should have to I've seen this on my own  This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass And move on into your own Your own  Reoccuring drowning effect Entrench my brain I hope you'll be ok someday So I can say That you moved on in the right way  We've seen this and We've breathed this and We've lived this on our own  This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own Your own, your own  Break  This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own Your own, your own, your own    Pertinence  : Well, their "pain" sounds pop-theme inspired, and that's how I always felt mine was, just drawing off things I've seen. And that's why I connected with this song. Picked up at the first of January.    Died  by Alice in Chains  I could climb until I reached where angels reside Ask around to find out where the junkie apply You just up and left me on this rock all alone It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died You died You died  I could drop until I touched a sinister side Visit all attractions slipping back at a slide Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died You died You died  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died You died You died Died Died You died You died  I could climb until I reached where angel reside I could drop until I touched a sinister side  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died  You died You died Died Died You died You died    Pertinence  : It's a cool song, it was the anthem of my headbangage at the beginning of August when all the weird stuff was happening. That was when the depresion first started, I think, and this song made it worse, but I listened to it anyway. And now's it just hardcore    Lost Horizons  by Gin Blossoms  The last horizons I can see Are filled with bars and factories And in them all we fight to stay awake  I'd drink enough of anything To make this world look new again I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves  She had nothing left to say So she said she loved me And I stood there grateful for the lie  I'd drink enough of anything To make this world look new again I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves  Turns summer trees to bones and ice Turn insect songs against the night With words we build and words we break I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves  Maybe I could use you To reassure myself I wouldn't wish this indecision On anybody else I'd drink enough of anything To make this world look new And when the sin smiles How can it be wrong  The last horizons I can see Are now resigned to memories I never thought I'd still be here today  I'd drink enough of anything To make myself look new again I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves    Pertinence  : Picked up the day before Thanksgiving, I was sitting there listening to this, driving by the Capitol park, and thinking, "what the hell am I doing to myself", whereafter things worked out. I credit this song with the inspiration to say all the right things.    Until I Fall Away  by Gin Blossoms  I wanna tell if I am or I am not myself It's hard to know how far or if at all to go I've waited far too long for something I forgot was wrong  I don't know all the answers Things that I'll find Won't have it within the time But it's all that I'll have in mind  Until I fall away That won't keep us waiting long Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away  My fear, pretend, that I'll never be in love again It's real to me, but not like these fools and not like this scene I won't find, or have it within the time  If it's all rusted and fade in the spot where we fell Where I thought I'd left behind And it's loose now but we could try  Until I fall away That won't keep us waiting long Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away  When there's no good answer To those new questions Another personal disaster There's nowhere to go but down  Until I fall away That won't keep us waiting long  Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away...    Pertinence  : UMMMM. Read the song again, please? Manic depressive central, holding on to a dream that's fading. Picked up at the same time as  Lost Horizons  and  Hey Jealousy , I actually did an acoustic cover of this song that turned out pretty good. The only song that ever puts my depression in words.    Chemical Tribe  by Jerry Cantrell  If I live so long To see 'em droppin' bombs Rather have you near Check out what comes after here Ah here What comes after here  Generation turned a chemical tribe Don't really care if we live or die Generation turned a chemical tribe It's a lie and it's no surprise, die  Let the black odds roll Why we can't tell Crawl inside Rolling over, is this hell? Is this hell?  Generation turned a chemical tribe Don't really care if we live or die Generation turned a chemical tribe It's a lie I can tell you why  No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reached the table Born in ending times Leaning more toward Cain than Able No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reach the table Born in ending times Possibly more truth than fable  Generation turned a chemical tribe Generation turned a chemical tribe Generation turned a chemical tribe Generation turned a chemical tribe It's alive, so say goodbye  No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reached the table Born in ending times Leaning more toward Cain than Able No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reach the table Born in ending times Possibly more truth than fable No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reached the table Born in ending times Leaning more toward Cain than Able  Bitchslapped 'fore you reach the table Could it be more truth than fable?    Pertinence  : It's a really scary song. I was listening to it in those dark endless days in October or so, when we all went to Firehouse that one time, that was about when I was listening to it. And it was killing me because it made me feel like dying, and got me really afraid for some reason, but I could never put it down. And now it just sounds cool.    Dam That River  by Alice in Chains  I clothed you in the canyon I drowned you in the lake You would think that I would tremble Only thing I'd not embrace  Oh you couldn't dam that river And maybe I don't give a damn anyway So you couldn't dam that river And it washed me so far away  I pushed and then you stumbled I kicked you in the face You stared at me so humble Got to keep that killing pace  Oh you couldn't dam that river And maybe I don't give a damn anyway So you couldn't dam that river And it washed me so far away  I burned the place around you I hit you with a rake You piss upon my candle So proving you're a fake  Oh you couldn't dam that river And maybe I don't give a damn anyway So you couldn't dam that river And it washed me so far away    Pertinence  : A hard hitting song, it came to me at the midst of August when I started having problems with my parents. There's nothing like listening to this song and kicking your door in, which I did. Plus, the line "You piss upon my candle"...wonder where I got it from now?    Mrs. Rita  by Gin Blossoms  I can see it in her letters On the paper with her pen Her response is getting stranger Think she's coming 'round again So tell me Mrs. Rita What's it say in my tarot Read my palm and tell me Why do lovers come and go  Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's coming 'round again  Well I've been keeping myself busy With my books and with my tapes And everyday's much better Since I've slowed my drinking pace There's no swimmin' in the bottle It's just someplace we all drown And I lost myself in sorrow I lost my confidence in doubt  Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's comin' 'round again  Get in the car and drive to town Down the block and back around Pretending that she's there with me, we drive Gone forever  Well my patience keeps me plaintive My high hopes keep me alone My lover's will is shakin' I wish she would just come home So tell me Mrs. Rita What's it say in my tarot Read my palm and tell me Why do lovers come and go  Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's comin' 'round again Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's comin' 'round again  I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round    Pertinence  : When I started to figure out, "hey, I dunno what it's like to love someone like this", this song came into play. Me wondering if I was doing anything right, and starting in on the depression again, looking for an answer when there isn't one.    I'm With You  by Avril Lavigne  I'm standing on a bridge  I'm waitin' in the dark  I thought that you'd be here by now  There's nothing but the rain  No footsteps on the ground  I'm listening but there's no sound   Isn't anyone tryin' to find me Won't somebody come take me home   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Won't you take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  But I I'm with you   I'm looking for a place  Searching for a face  Is anybody here I know  Cuz nothing's going right  And everything's a mess  And no one likes to be alone   Isn't anyone tryin' to find me Won't somebody come take me home   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Won't you take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I I'm with you   Oh, why is everything so confusing  Maybe I'm just out of my mind  Yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Won't you take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I  I'm with you, I'm with you   Take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I I'm with you, I'm with you  Take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you    Pertinence  : It's just a really peaceful song, the first time I heard it, it got stuck in my head. Yeah yeah, she's a poser, but the song is still nice. And I said it was going to go somewhere, I had a lot of space left over, so I stuck it in. Picked up about three days ago from this post.    Got Me Wrong  by Alice in Chains  Yeah, it goes away All of this and more of nothing in my life No color clay Individuality not safe  As of now I think you've got me wrong So I'm sure you run from something strong  I can't let go Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow Feel a tortured brain Show your belly like you want me to  As of now I bet you got me wrong So I'm sure we reach for something strong I haven't felt like this in so long Wrong, innocence too far gone from love That don't last forever Something's gotta turn out right  You, sugar taste Sweetness doesn't often touch my face Stay if you please You may not be here when I leave  As of now I think you got me wrong So I'm sure we reach for something strong I haven't felt like this in so long Wrong, innocence too far gone from love Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long Wrong, innocence too far gone from love That don't last forever Something's gotta turn out right    Pertinence  : Well, this song is about me, I think. "You've got me wrong", I think I was really misunderstood during the "bleeding months", like why I was killing myself over shit that was well within my control. And "reach for something strong", find another thing to solve my problems, like talking to others about it, to find that ultimate "answer". "I can't let go"...:Individuality not safe". A good summary of my changing personality during the last six months.   Happy Happy Joy Joy  by Wax  Happy happy joy joy...  Hello boys and girls, this is your old pal Stinky Whizzleteets, and this is a song about a whale! No! This is a song about being happy! That's right! It's the "Happy Happy Joy Joy" song.  Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy joy  Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy joy Joy  Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy joy Joy  I don't think you're happy enough I'll teach you to be happy And I'll teach your grandma to suck eggs  Now, boys and girls Let's try again  You are granted that we're all liars The little critters of nature They don't know that they're ugly  That's very funny  Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy joy  JOY Hey hey hey  Happy Joy Happy Joy Happy Joy  You are granted that we're all liars The little critters of nature They don't know that they're ugly  That's very funny  Happy Joy Happy, joy, happy Joy  Like a fly marrying a bumblebee I told you to shoot but you wouldn't believe me Why didn't you believe me? WHY? Why didn't you believe me? AUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH    Pertinence  : This is mostly for Kenzie, it's the funniest song ever. We were both sorta depressed and talking about cartoons, and I mentioned I had this CD with  Happy Happy Joy Joy  on it. So I went and got it, and listened to it...GOD. The end is the best part, the little "AUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH" is quite possibly the greatest part of any song, ever. We listened to it about 130495243750475294 times and were feeling much better after it. Picked up at the midst of January.    My Solution  by Stranglebox  Asylum was the answer The opened doors and let me in And told me time was not unmaking  They told me I could finally win I seek now retribution Raised my eyes and then I saw The steel and lonesome of my prison Bang my head against the stone cold floor  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away  Silence now my reason I sat alone inside myself I gave the all that I had in me They stole my life and gave me hell Addiction was the cancer And God, the price I paid And slowly dying I surrendered My poisoned soul as it fades to gray  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away, yeah  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that I've laid my life to waste My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away My solution, I'm gonna find out the only way to escape And my solution, that I break free from the cage    Pertinence  : Well, one part of the story is, I wrote it. And the other part is, it happened to me. This is the summary of rejection and depression throughout the span of these six months, and I called it  My Solution . It's about suicide, if you haven't noticed. Being trapped to one part of myself and finding no other way to leave it, knowing what is wrong for me, and doing it anyway. This is the song I wrote for just that, for just not making the cut, for just not being on the level to get what I wanted. And the only way to get myself away from it was to end myself.  The song was written in early September and finished in October or November. It took a few months of work to nail, and it was a really agonizing process. After that, we took a long break; we're back now recording  Little Rhyme , still getting it down, along with  Bitter  and  After Memory Has Faded . It should be finished sometime at the end of summer, there's going to be about a session a day then.  Don't ask how long this took. Suffice to say, HOURS.   Enjoy when you get it. I'll put a link in the template to this day so you can go back and read the lyrics in the future.  Whoo.

      Jeezus, everyone's got mono these days.  Umm well, what's new...  The future that was full of potential is now full of uncertainty, for a lot of reasons. I'm worried that Kenzie is turning in to me, she sounds  just  like I have the past few weeks.  I had a thought, you may think someone's tortures are pathetic and stupid, but be a human and help them. That was very philanthropic, but it seems like everyone who has a pathetic problem is casted off as such, and were we to do this, we would be no better than animals...I think it's time to change the focus a little.  Happy Chinese New Year's Eve.  I just got finished burning POOR BASTARD VOLUME ONE (AUGUST 2002-JANUARY 2003). And it is GREAT and REALLY different from the first intended, this actually encompasses a much broader scope than the end of August, it strectches into the really bad part of the beginning of August, lots of weird stuff happening, parental conflicts, et cetera, mega depressed, which is why the stuff at the end of August started happening.   There's a lot I haven't talked about yet. Ask me sometime.  AND NOW, THE FINAL TRACKLIST, lyrics when I feel like it, there's 17 songs.   POOR BASTARD VOLUME ONE (AUGUST 2002-JANUARY 2003)  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I. Blood Brothers - Papa Roach II. Hey Jealousy - Gin Blossoms III. Sorrowful Farewell - Rotting Christ IV. For Whom The Bell Tolls - Metallica V. All I Want - Toad the Wet Sprocket VI. Hold Me Down VII. Poem - Taproot VIII. Died - Alice in Chains IX. Lost Horizons - Gin Blossoms X. Until I Fall Away - Gin Blossoms XI. Chemical Tribe - Jerry Cantrell XII. Dam That River - Alice in Chains XIII. Mrs. Rita - Gin Blossoms XIV. I'm With You - Avril Lavigne XV.Got Me Wrong - Alice in Chains XVI. Happy Happy Joy Joy - Wax XVII. My Solution - Stranglebox (our current band name)  Vanilla Coke makes me depressed now.  I'll post a short description of the pertinence of each post with the lyrics.  And let's see if this thing posts, because my dad's computer sux today.

      Hey, Rosie, just a question.  Why do you care?  I for one am perfectly happy in my lack of social standing.  I have thought of this subject before, however, and have decided that I don't care.  And since when do I fit the mold?  I'm one example.  There have to be others.  Linds, maybe.    No smiling.  This I order.  ;( hehehe  ~Z  P.S. What interview?

      Hey people, SO Joah...why is it so important that you hate Gunter. Can you do me a fave and let it just be.  Have you realized how fake our society is. I mean think about it.....the whole world believes that everyone has there place and if they leave it......here comes the tidal waves. Crossing social barriers in BHS is next to impossible without whispers and stares. Is this what they call America, the most welcome country? Everyone plays to the role untill that role is all they have, so they stick to that role through life then pass it to there children. Ugg why can't people be themselves. Why can't people NOT fit the mold for once?  Smile all, life's great.  oh and the interview went well

      Well, not much to say.  Apparently Linds has mono...which really sucks.  I still can't think of anything worthwhile so I will leave you now.  See you on Monday but I will probably post again before then.  ~Z

      Agh, I had a huge post last night explaining about Poor Bastard 2 last night, then my computer froze. GOD.  I posted the new track list to Poor Bastard 1, which includes Gin Blossoms (a lot of 'em), Rotting Christ, Taproot, Alice in Chains, Metallica, Papa Roach, Nirvana, Wax, myself...mostly Gin Blossoms.  Now the second one, like I was trying to say, is going to have a lot of the stuff I left out the first time.  A few more from  New Miserable Experience ,  Cheatin'  if it's not on this one, and  Cajun Song . Plus one from  Congratulations I'm Sorry ,  Competetion Smile , which I typed down, and NOW IT'S GONE.  And Alice and Metallica, say  We Die Young  or something off of  Sap  or something really hardcore, and  Dirt , of course, for Alice, and  My Friend of Misery  for Metallica, say.  Definitely more Jerry this time,  Give It A Name , and  Dickeye . There are two others that are really good, but I can't stand to listen to them anymore, they get me really depressed for some reason,  Breaks My Back  and  My Song . They're good, but I'm not going to put them on any of these.  I posted Toad once, so I'll put that song on it,  I Will Not Take These Things For Granted . What a change from the other songs, it's... peaceful .  And the Avril Lavigne song,  I'm With You , and Soundgarden's  Outshined .  I wanted to put  Glory of Sadness  by Roting Christ on the first one, but it's long, four minutes of music, like nine minutes of silence, and a weird outro for about two minutes. So I'm going to find a way to cut it down and then I'll put it on there. Plus  Khronos , it's not a lyrically pertinent song, it just makes me feel weird when I listen to it.  If you noticed, the full title of the first one is  Poor Bastard Volume One, August 2002-January 2003 , so that's about six months or so. I probably won't wait that long on the next one, it just depends on how quick I find about sixteen songs that mean something. I really also want to wait 'til Alex and I get  Little Rhyme  recorded, so we can put one of our own on every one of these things... My Solution 's on the first one, the last track because it's SOOOOOOOOO special.  One will be ready as soon as I get to my dad's today.  Well, I was gonna post a ton of those songs and then it bombed, and I really don't want to right now, I have the whole night ahead of me, and it's a free period in school right now.   I will restate my threat, GUNTER I AM GOING TO FUCKING END YOU. You'd reallllllllyyyyyy better apply what you say to yourself before you say it. I called him a dickhead in first today, Rosie comes back and says he said the same about me last night. This dude has too much arrogance blinding him. At least when I'm being an asshole I figure it out eventually. This guy fucking  never  will. I'm not really concerned, it's just the fact that he called me as he did and knows absolutely nothing about me, firstly, nor have I done anything like he's doing. I know his kind well enough, plus his exploits equal asshole, so that's where I get it from.  Why the hell am I wasting my energy...  HEYY it's the 31st today, I thought it was yesterday...heh oops.  Well, I get to go home today and play Counterstrike, that should be fun. Then I get to cry a lil' more here, and burn a few CDs. And other stuff.  I don't have cable at my dad's anymore, him and his bitching about not having money left over after bills, what he has still gets him by, and  trust me , he doesn't NEED anything else, you can find ANYTHING in "The Hole". God, well, he'll get it back in about a week when he realizes how much he misses it.  "I Hate Myself And Want To Die" by Nirvana...what a great song title.  And with this, I bid you adieu.   Cajun Song  by Gin Blossoms  Well she's leaving today I do know So far away I'm feeling so blue and it shows In every single way Once that girl, she was mine For such a short time We used to spend every night Now all I do is cry  They say that you can't miss Something that you've never had So tell me why Why I could feel so bad  Well we used to walk down the path Just like lovers do She'd hold my hands and we'd laugh And I'd stare in her eyes, they were blue Once that girl, she was mine For such a short time We used to spend every night Now all I do is cry  They say that you can't miss Something that you've never had So tell me why Why I could feel so bad Why I could feel so bad Why I could feel so bad   Ok, a little corny, but it's a driving song.   We Die Young  by Alice in Chains Scary's on the wall Scary's on his way Watch where you spit But I'd advise you wait until it's over Then you got hit And you should've know better  And we die young Faster we run  Down down down you're rollin' Watch the blood flood to the muddy sewer Take another hit And bury your brother  And we die young Faster we run  Scary's on the wall Scary's on his way Another alley trip Bullets seek the place to bend you over Then you got hit And you should've know better  Faster we run And we die young   Whee, I'm on a roll.   Competetion Smile  by Gin Blossoms  Looking up I saw nothing but  Blue in the bluest sky And now it's creeping across my eye And falling down in my mind Down in my mind I'm high and I'm hopeless so Help me to get untied Fast asleep now I'm going blind And falling down in my mind Down in my mind just fine  Emulate the style A competetion smile  Now I'm running not looking and Opening up my brain Where it's easy to lose my name Looking dumb in the rain Dumb in the rain I'm hoping you'll notice that No one else helps me grow Oh it's not easy to let you know What I'm dying to show Dying to know you'll know  Pretending all the while A competetion smile  Now I've thrown something far And it haunts me like a curse I'm like a stone falling hard And I'm only getting worse  Looking up I saw nothing but Blue in the bluest sky And now it's creeping across my eye And falling down in my mind Down in my mind I'm high and I'm hopeless so Help me to get untied Fast asleep now I'm going blind And falling down in my mind Down in my mind just fine  Pretending all the while A competetion smile  I'm hiding high I'm hiding high   The story of my life in that song.   Hold Me Down  by Gin Blossoms  So I guess I must have just been dreaming When I thought I heard myself say no Anyway it looks like no one heard me  So here I go Cause when you're in the company of strangers  Or just the strangers you call friends You know before you start just how it's  Going to end  When the doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around Anytime the pickins look too easy Hold me down  I can't remember why I like this feeling  When it only seems to let me down Soon I find I'm searching for the exit  From the ground If I think the room is turning faster Then I think the music is too loud By then I've lived another broken story to let me down  When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around When half the party moves into the bathroom  Hold me down Or if you're at the tail end of the evening  And Dr. Feelgood comes around Anytime the pickins look too easy Hold me down  Down if I want that part Down if I've gone too far  Well I guess I must have just been reeling When I felt myself begin to fall I realize I'm bounding down the hallways  And off the walls If my bed was standing in the corner  I could just fall into it right now And know that I'd just be staring at the ceiling  Going round  When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down   They're so drunk, I love 'em.   My Friend Of Misery  by Metallica  You just stood there screaming Feeling no one would listen to you They say the empty can rattles the most The sound of your own voice must soothe you Hearing only what you wanna hear And knowing only what you heard You, you're smothered in tragedy And you're off the save the world  Misery You insist that the weight of the world Should be on your shoulders Misery There's much more to life than what you see My friend of misery  You still stood there screaming No one caring about these words you tell My friend, before your voice is gone One man's fun is another's hell These times are sent to try men's souls And something wrong with all you see You, you'll take it on all yourself Remember, misery loves company  Misery You insist that the weight of the world Should be on your shoulders Misery There's much more to life that what you see My friend of misery, my friend of misery  Misery You insist that the weight of the world Should be on your shoulders Misery There's much more to life that what you see My friend of misery  You just stood there screaming, oh My friend of misery   'Tis beautiful.  Motivation is cool.  And that, friends, is the end.

      You shouldn't feel shame, Josh.  At least one person will be standing with you...me.  I like Avril Lavigne.  No problem here. I like that song, too.  If you want ME to post it, I will to alleviate your feelings of shame.  I wouldn't say I'm shameless, but maybe more so than you in this case.  When will PB 1, 2, etc. be available?  I want one!  Or two or however many!  ;)  See you people tomorrow.  And what am I, Bureaucrat?  I think so.  I have escaped the vacuum that is Walt.  ~Z

      Heh, Switzerland is cool, my neighbor is from Switzerland.  At least her ancestors were.  I made a post yesterday, but it didn't come through. AGH, there was a great song in there,  Outshined  by Soundgarden. That was how I was feeling yesterday, I'll post it again, it needs to go on PB2. And...umm....  I've got a stupidish song stuck in my head that I'll probably post here (if I can choke down the shame) and put on the second CD, it's an....uh......Avril Lavigne song.....put those rocks down... I'm With You , I feel like I've heard it a long time ago, perhaps some song that someone else did that sounds a lot like it. Or psychic foresight.   I was really tired last night, I shouldn'tve had those two Cokes yesterday. One, en moderato, two, in x s. Sweet.   "Heya Gunter what's going on? crowbarSMACK" FIGHTFIGHTFIGHT  Josh sees the deeper surfaces........Rosie.........so be careful when you say  I'm  wrong about Asshole (capitalized to denote a person). Am I actually good about seeing underlying intentions and just don't know it? Hmm, maybe SOME PEOPLE have been giving me the wrong idea, "No no you're wrong,"...you know who you are.  Vincent? Might need to explain that one a little.  Time for  Outshined .   Outshined  by Soundgarden  I got up feeling so down I got off being sold out I've kept the movie rolling But the story's getting old now Oh yeah  Well I just looked in the mirror And things aren't looking so good I'm looking California And feeling Minnesota Oh yeah  So now you know Who gets mystified So now you know Who gets mystified  Show me the power child I'd like to say That I'm down on my knees today Ooh it gives me the butterflies Gives me away 'Til I'm up on my feet again  I'm feeling outshined Ooh I'm feeling outshined outshined outshined  Someone let the dogs out They'll show you where the truth is The grass is always greener Where the dogs are shedding Oh yeah  I'm feeling that I'm sober Even though I'm drinking And I can't get any lower Still I feel I'm sinking Oh yeah  So now you know Who gets mystified So now you know Who gets mystified  Show me the power child I'd like to say That I'm down on my knees today Ooh it gives me the butterflies Gives me away 'Til I'm back on my feet again  I'm feeling outshined Ooh I'm feeling outshined outshined outshined  (arbitrary "ooh"ing and "outshined"s for an interlude)  So now you know  Who gets mystified So now you know Who gets mystified  Show me the power child I'd like to say That I'm down on my knees today Ooh it gives me the butterflies Gives me away 'Til I'm back on my feet again  I'm feeling outshined Ooh I'm feeling outshined outshined outshined  Show me the power child I'd like to say That I'm down on my knees today Ooh it gives me the butterflies Give me away 'Til I'm back on my feet again  I'm feeling outshined Ooh I'm feeling outshined outshined outshined  Godddddddd, I would do  I'm With You  if it weren't for the shame of being in school and having everyone watch me look at Avril Lavigne lyrics. This doesn't happen often, but even still....while it is.  PURE TORTURE, I haven't heard it in about three days. So it'll be stuck for a long time. I have to quit cold turkey.  Simply not listening is like really weak methadone.

      Indeed I do remember that, Linds.  And even though I know very little of that story, I believe that there are some definite similarities.    Josh, I really have to say thanks for calling me "the wisest" earlier on in the lifespan of this site.  That was really sweet.  I have no experience in these kinds of problems, as some of my friends can't help reminding me about, so I will not get involved.  I have read the entire thing so far and I just want to be here if you need help, ok, Josh?  I shalt pass no judgement.  I am Switzerland, the neutral party in this war.    Okay, bad...metaphor? but get over it.  It's just my way.  See you all in Scumbucket tomorrow.  ;)  ~Z

[Disclaimer for Leigh's sake: Jackie is engaged so there is no possibility of there being competition.] This whole thing reminds me of her thing with Vincent.  Do you remember that, Elizabeth?  If you do, you'll see the similiarity.  [Second Disclaimer because I always tend to get things wrong: If Leigh happens not to like Josh at this particular moment, please don't bitch me out]

      Well here's the last post on badvision...  Lily was editing it at the library, Leigh Anne looked over her shoulder, boom. That was the end of it.  So let me say something.  Friends understand each other, they understand why others do things, and they are quick to forgive. Friends want friends around, and if they really don't, then they really don't want to be friends at all. Something, but not friends.  And friends listen to others. Perhaps the answers we're all looking for lie in the ones were ignoring, probably because they're right. I know this, I have found this several times.  I know who my friends are.  I know what I don't understand.  I know that if this understanding is to come, it's on the part of the thing not understood.  I have seen my mistakes.  I've tried to fix them.  I cannot.  Because they never die.  The funny thing about any problem I have is, none of them are bad at all anymore. The thing is, they're just so well timed. Things are good for me and suddenly it's a one-two punch and it all falls down again, I think it's not going to be that way for much longer, I see myself looking at these things as no surprise, and with no more surprises, they'll just stop happening.  I revamped the song  Bitter  for the third time see what you can get out of the first lines: "Where did my sunshine go, I think it's ever-fade"...if that tells you anything.  Play with fire and you get burned, though, that's the way the cookie crumbles, the ball drops, the bee stings, one two three whee. I should've seen this coming, if it's public access it's bound to end up that way.  But I hope you all know why I made the posts I did, I hope you all know why I do these things, and I think you do.  Because if not, just leave off of me.  And again I turn the page.

      Hahaha.  Remember when things weren't so complicated? That was fun.  There's fun in this, just weird fun. O well o well.  Je vais aller a la bibliotheque aujourd'hui, dans Nashville. Ce vais etre super, c'est la premier rendezvous avec la jeune fille qui a la nom Leigh Anne. Zut...je ne crois pas si je veux faire la rendezvous. J'ai peur. Mais, c'est la vie.  (I am going to go to the library today, in Nashville. This is going to be great, it's the first meeting with the little girl who is named Leigh Anne. Damn...I don't know if I am able to do it. I'm scared. But, that's life.)  Why did I do that, I dunno. I wanted to test mon technique de francais. I'm did for shit in that class last nine weeks.  And I get to meet Kenzie's friend that likes me, Laurie, heh she even asked me out last night, she's seen the "bird" picture, apparently, but she didn't know that was me when she did. So that's going to be fascinating.   But god, I couldn't believe it, how quick she was. "I need to get to know you better" and I knew it right then. And then later I flashed over to talk to Leigh Anne and I flashed back, and Kenzie was like, Laurie wants to know if you're available, and I was like, yah sure. I really hope she's not serious.  She's a redhead, I hear.  Godddddddd......  This could be a fucking  BAD  trip. Or good. But I don't know.   Do I ever?

      Let me start the second part of this long, long night with a song, because it IS going to be long, already.   Iris  by the Goo Goo Dolls  And I'd give up forever to touch you Cuz I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't wanna go home right now And I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life And sooner or later it's over I just don't wanna miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want to world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  (interlude)  And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am  I was thinking of this song because of a few things: I started thinking about Zoe's Blurty, and in that you can be affiliated with certain groups of common interests. One of them was for cutting and understand why they do it, and also to help them get over it. There were a few quotes from songs in there that relate to it, and one of them was:  Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive . So I thought about that. Then today, I was taking a nap and I remembered it and resolved to post it here. It sounds just like me.  I used to realllllllllllyyyyyy like the Goo Goo Dolls, I haven't listened to them in a while though. I guess I'll be picking that one back up soon.  Iris  shall be on Poor Bastard Vol. 2 (and yes, the first one's official title is Poor Bastard Vol. 1, Aug 2002 - Jan 2003, the list is a little different since Tinblogged got deleted and that was the only place I put it).  And now to the pressing matter.  It seems that one of Kenzie's friends wants to go out with me. I brought it up with Leigh Anne and she was like, "Well at least it'll get you off my back," and I said, "Oh no, you can't shake me that easy," and she was like, "Damn,". Ok.  But the thing is, it was really half-hearted, to the point where even I could take it that way, and second, when she's trying to shake me off, she'll use the phrase, "Just move on,".   I need some interpretations, by the way: "It's going to be really funny when you find out you don't care about me." and "You lied; you said you loved me."  Actually, I know what they both are quintessentially, "I want attention", the Leigh Anne fling. It's amazing how desperately she needs it.  But right now she's talking to Brittany, and Brittany has a lot of sway over her, whether she'd like to admit it or not.  It's going to be a long night. This would've been longer had she not called back just now.  ARGH.  I'm weird, but my shirt smells really good right now.  HeeHAW.

      okay. The little note of goodbye was what I did to xi. Deal with it. I didn't want to go in circles and I really seemed that you hated me and wanted me gone. I didn't want to "defy" you so I left, for now. You know the Xi story.   Anyway. Yeah about Gunter I get what you're saying. Gunter is out of the picture now forever. He's out of it too so don't take anything to heart.

      Ok Rosie, the biggest thing that pisses me off about Gunter.  The fact that you say you're all over him and so is he. And that fact that he says so and is being so fake...well...I just can't take fakeness, or arrogance, which he has in abundance. Like today when he called Alex stupid for not knowing a Calculus problem. He's probably the only geekass on the fucking planet that knows the answer to that. And then he jibed at him. Alex was just doing it for fun, but Gunter didn't have to react like he did, "I'm better than you because I'm a senior and I know more math stuff and you can piss off and suck me you underling". SO GAY. I wanted to fucking BLAST him today. And I wanted to throw the Gilgamesh box at you too for being all "HEHEHE" at him.  Yet I  know  he isn't over it (I was like him a long time ago, the "sutble flirt"), and if you're being all overly nice to him and trying to get into his head like you are he's going to take it the wrong way.  I can't tell you to stop, because I wouldn't listen either in that situation.  But I'm telling you to look to the horizon so as to prevent the present from closing in.

      To Lily (adendum):  Does she really? I really don't know.  Every time I bring up the point that you've said something along those lines, she's like "You really believe her?" and actually...I do. Most of the time I think it's just me clinging on to a crumbling ledge, but maybe you really are right. Idon'tknowIdon'tknowIdon'tknow. I don't know. I think she does myself.   But then I tell myself, that's just what you want to think, not what really is.   I wish she would just find one she could confide in, that would make things a lot easier for me.  But who said it was going to be easy?

      Well, here I sit again.  "Uh oh" you say, you go and grab a drink because you know this is going to be one of  those . You sit back and stare blankly at the screen, letting a bit of spit fall from your open jaws as you sort through this post and get the message: "I wanna bitch". It's the same one tenfold, but for some reason there's something new to get out of it every time.  I'm not intending for this one to be long. Which means it probably will be.  I want you all to know, especially Lindsey, that you all did  not  screw up my life. Let me see if I can retell this plainly.  Leigh Anne called back shortly after Rosie to ask for Brittany's phone number. After a while she handed the phone to Lily. Lily's mom picked up and told her to get off because she needed to use it, whereafter she didn't use it. But anyway, Lily put down the phone and forgot about it.  Meanwhile, I set up this BLog and posted that one at the bottom in Kenzie's, where, shortly after, I deleted it, for reasons that will become apparent in a few lines here.  I had a silent line for 93 minutes before Lily noticed the phone off the hook and picked it up, whereupon she said "Hello?" and I said, "Umm...hi,"...there was a round of laughs, then Leigh Anne was inspired to talk to me and say that she was upset with me and didn't hate me anymore. After a minute, she told me they were setting up a tent and that she was going to go and help them. She was trying to get away from them for a second by locking herself in a closet or something, and I didn't think it worked, because she eventually gave in and just said, "I love you," and hung up.  So that was ULTRA cool for me. I went and played darts with my sister's friend who was staying over, I won.  They called back shortly after. There were a few more Iluvu's in there, there was some sappiness, which Leigh Anne alleged would happen, and then she hung up at about 1:30, whereafter, Lily tells me, they went to sleep.  So the next day I guess Leigh Anne was still like that for a while. Things went bad at about 5 that evening. They got worse at 6:30. Then I went to my dad's house feeling generally pissed at my dying fortune.  And then that night she just asked me to forget about it again. That she wasn't interested in a relationship with anyone, that she needed a friend. There are some other things that were more personal when we were together that came up, but they eventually were also rescinded until there was nothing left but a big fuckin' gap of silence, whereafter I put down the phone and read your posts. I had said no arguing, I felt like there was some here, so I just decided to call the other people off. Plus Rosie's  ultimately  childish post of "Joah...God I hate you." As if I needed anymore of that stuff.   I posted it to see whom of you would stick by me no matter what. It really seems though, now that I look at it, that Rosie was reallllllllllyyyyy eager to give up on me...some friend :), well we've got things straightened out for the most part.  Then I woke up the next morning and felt stupid because I really enjoy the outside input at times, so I went back on it but it was a little too late for that. So today in fourth I answered Lily's post for the most part(there's more answers for her and Lindsey after this one, by the way), and I resent an invitation to join the BLog since Lindsey had backed out and was mad at me.  So that is the story. Last night things were pretty good for a while. But I really don't care. Actually, at one point, Leigh Anne had this horoscope thing on her cell and was telling me to think of a question and tell her...at one of them I just said, "Can I just keep it in my head?" and she said ok, and the real question was, "Will things ever work out with me and her?", and the VERY astonishing answer was a bunch of star alignment bullshit followed by the interpretation, "Give it time and it will work in the near future,". I was like, WHOA. She asked what the question was and I was too stunned to think for a second. Then I said something about if I was going out to eat or not that day.  She always thinks of something bad when I'm making her laugh, and she bring it up, after which it'll be a thorn in my side and I really can't be humorous anymore and she'll start talking about all these guys...I swear to god, this girl has no female friends, and the ones that could be considered so, she can't connect with them, or they're lesbians and they're after her.  So that's about it for now, that's the story so far.  Fucking story.

      Sorry, Josh.  I think I'm gonna take a backseat with this one for a while.  Screwing up your life was not intentional.  I promised myself I would never do what Paul did to me and I haven't yet; I just want to make sure I don't.  So if I start giving you advice or anything just tell me to shut up.  But there is something pretty important that I need to tell you.  Call me when you get a chance.  It's not urgent or anything.

      Well that's encouraging. The problem is wondering how hard to hold on, if it's really worth it at all to go so strong.  I did before and that was stupid. So I'll just wait for the winds to change.  That FUCK YOU post was really in angst against her taking it all back, that's just the lil' screaming child post coming to life. It's hard to stand strong when so many things are hitting you, like being an oak in a hurricane.  Pretending yes, as to how, I really don't know. I just like to conceal little things about myself.  And sorry to everyone for being an idiot and not calling certain persons back (you know who you are Lindsey :) ), some major stuff was up that night and I forgot about it eventually. VERY SORRY! I was kind of worried, though, as to what I would tell you anyway. So that was probably a part of it.  Gonna try and reinvite Lindsey, pick up the pieces of this BLog and all my friends and such.  Girls...  Argh.

      Sorry Joshies! I had to work the whole day today then i went swimming, it was an INSIDE POOL! Anywho, Josh, if you feel that way so badly why don't you just tell Leigh? *I* know she can be an ass sometimes, and I know how much you like her, I know she likes you too, she just has this problem of showing her actual feelings, I suggest for you to hold on a while longer, if she doesn't turn then I think you should forget her, I know how much you've tried and they'll pay off one day. She  REALLY  likes you, she just doesn't know how to show it. You've been pretending thw holw time? Josh, that's not very nice. I mean, I tell you the problems I have with Kenzie because I can't talk to anyone else about it, just let me in on a few things! I don't want you to pretend to me. Anywho, Erm..... I can tell Hua likes you to the point that she'll admit she loves you. She's just really secretive. Yeah, all girls/women are fickle. She'll turn around someday, but it's your choice if you want to hang on to her or not. I'm about to have a serious talk with Leigh. See you people around Later! Oh, and Joshies, I'll call you in a little while!  Lily the psycho powered one

      You're reading way too deep into this.  I didn't say that I never wanted you as friends, I just didn't want to be criticized for the things I've been doing, and I was getting that.  Especially from Rosie, unfortunately. I hope you remember your reaction at Lindsey's house on Friday. Because I sure as  hell  do.  I've decided not to remove anyone, that was Leigh Anne's wish that there be no one but myself on here, and it would be foolish to adhere to it, considering she'll never find it.  I really don't know what to find out of anyone anymore...I really want to see what's left after all that's happened so far. Perhaps last night's post was to test my real friends from the ones who really do use me and this plight as entertainment, and seeing as how I wasn't attacked directly, and in fact the matter at hand wasn't attacked, I really have found the ones that will stay.  Not that that was my preliminary intention; I know this probably did cause a lot of damage, but I cannot apologize, I had to know.  To understand me, you have to know that my world is made up of definites, and anything that goes against that will not work. My fear of commitment and God, all because they are not definite.   And the real me is a screaming little boy. He's locked away and huddled over and screaming his lungs out, he's cold and alone and he loves it that way, even though he hates it, because I could let that boy out but I am afraid to, because I don't know if he'll be the one to change from it.  Plus the fact that the things he wants to show all of you and tell you that he's seen. No one would like what he sees, he envisions the world as innately evil, and truly, he is right, but he knows the depth of it.  It scares me because the boy is cunning. He's something else...I could call him wicked but that's not what he is, he's been twisted by his thoughts.  He only comes out at my worst, he came out on the last post and did something that probably destabalized the people it was aimed at. But it's something he wants you to hear so that it will stop bothering him, it's bothering him that he could ever think that he was being blamed for something that isn't his fault.  Don't expect an apology, that post wasn't pure malice. That was the reality in my head.  To understand me, find me at my worst and learn.  But never judge.

      Joah. One time I asked if I knew you, really knew you. I didn't know all of you but most. What heck do you mean by acting like you are just now telling us that you pretend. You've been telling me since day one and you expect me not to try to find the real you? I've been trying ever since but apparently you don't see that. I never thought that we would ever fight over the true you or even Leigh. She was there for you, to help you but sometimes she wasn't there. I wanted to talk to her about that. I have no sorries to give. Leigh is as she is and I supposed that you see her life with yours. Enjoy. I cared about you Joah and since you never want us to be friends apparently I have to say bye.

      I'm taking all of you off. I knew it wouldn't work, it was a bad idea. Sorry, but if I can't have one of you, I won't have any of you. And remember, it's nothing personal, it's just something I need to do for now, I need to listen to myself and only myself. Trust that you'll be back very shortly. I'll give you all one last post unless I hear otherwise, attack me and not each other...although the rest of this post is going to be damned contradictory to that last part.  Why is it...  Everything I do is hopeless.  Everything I say is worthless.  Everything is just dead. I don't understand why things are so great one minute and ruined the next. Leigh Anne and I were together today, and all of a sudden, she decided to take it all back.  And it wonders me that I can't just let it all go and hang up the silent phone right now, the silent phone with that girl's bullshit as she takes back slowly everything and acts like she's all above it. Like none of this will ever come back to get her.  Believe me, when it does, I'd love to say I'd be the first one to point and laugh, but I know I won't, and the rest of you know it too.  It is ridiculous how much I punish myself...  But it is more grossly fascinating of how much strength I have. With this, I could conquer the world, and instead I foolishly spend it on a girl who loves me sometimes and is irresolute the next, one who I'll always come crawling back to.  After all, having her is a dream. You always chase your dreams, and when it's in your grasp, you grab it, no matter the consequence.  I need to talk to someone with an answer, not just good ideas. Not people at war, not people that look at the surface and laugh or get angry. Not any of you who mock and jeer when I'm down because it's all my fault in the end, everyone, whether you'd like to admit it or not, points the finger at me...and you should all be pointing them to the girl who said, "I think I'm in love with him", and twenty-four hours later, "Why can't you forget it?; I just take it back,"...you do for a while, you did, but your posts shine through that.  "Joah. God I hate you."..."We're about as happy with you as you are with us."...what friends I have, friends who will never look deeper than the surface, whether they like to admit it or not.  So maybe that tells me that I should really stop being so kind to all of you since you really don't deserve it. I've noticed I get struck when I can't defend, right here in this BLog. Doesn't it make you feel invincible? Do you ever think that I won't respond, I'll take it and be apologetic? Should I, anymore?  And the answer is: Yes, it does, Yes, you think I won't say anything, and No, I shouldn't apologize. I really didn't ask any of you to get involved if you noticed. My depression was my silent cry, but you didn't have to listen, I've borne it all on my own before and got through it. I was changed at the end for the worse, but at least I didn't care what was happening to me.  I want something to happen to everyone else all at the same time just so I can feel a little better, just so I won't be the hopeless, the lowman anymore.  I need something beyond me. I have a hope and it's dying, I still hold. I have a dream and it's fading, I still seek it. I have memories and they burn, they become real and they haunt me.  She haunts me, who is the one who will not let go?  She is a liar, and I am a fool.  Lily, I need to talk to you about some things seriously...we've already been over a lot of this before but I need to ask it all in a different way. So just give me a call as soon as you can.  Kenzie, I probably blame you the least for all of these things, but I won't forget some things...I forgive them, but I cannot forget.  Lindsey and Rosie...what can I say...I could apologize for some things, but I deserve it for others.   Elizabeth, I don't know what you think, and you are probably the wisest.  And Leigh Anne...  FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FOR EVERYTHING FUCK YOU FOR THIS FUCK YOU FOR TAKING ME AND BREAKING ME FUCK YOU FOR DESTROYING MY HEAD FUCK YOU FOR BOTH THESE TIMES AND THE ONES TO COME THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL EVER BE GOOD IS WHEN YOU ARE HUMBLED AND BROKEN AND I WAIT FOR THIS DAY I SEE IT COMING AND I LONG FOR IT AND I HOPE IT KILLS YOU LIKE IT KILLED ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I HOPE YOU LONG FOR AN ANSWER AND NEVER GET ONE AND I HOPE AT THE END OF IT ALL I'M THE ONLY THING LEFT THEN IT ALL STARTS OVER AGAIN THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE WAY I ALWAYS HAD IN MIND THE WAY THAT COULD HAVE WORKED THE WAY WHERE NO ONE WINS THINGS JUST ARE WHAT THEY ARE AND ARE NO MORE THAN THAT   Trust in this, because it is coming . If you put in too much it gets spit up at you when it can't hold anymore. I know that better than anyone, what comes around goes around.   To all of you...  See me for who I really am, not what I pretend to be.  And know...  I think I've been pretending the whole time.  Sorry.

      Agh, Nigel is gone.  We kinda decided after the fact that he's too feral to live here. For the first seven months of his life, he lived in the woods and under my aunt's bed, and would never get comfortable here, so...  Getting a kitten instead, in about two weeks.  SOB. He was great, I opened his lil' cage and moved his blanket, he BUSTED out of the cage and DESTROYED the room. It was SO AWESOME. I LOVE that cat. But he's GONE. FUCK.  Well maybe the cat shall be just as crazy.  I hope.

      Well, Nigel is here...  He's scared as hell and just sitting in his cage. His ears are HUGE. He's so awesome.  Chloe saw him a minute ago and hissed at him, then walked off and started smelling all his stuff. Chloe's out of the computer room now...  I don't know how well this is going to work out.

      YAY! I'm getting a new puss in a minute here.  His name is Nigel, he was abandoned, and my aunt takes care of abandoned cats and stuff...well, my dad saw Nigel a few weeks ago (say before Thanksgiving) and decided to take him...he's been "rehabed" shall we say, and he's gonna be here in a few minutes. He's REALLY black and REALLY soft and REALLY little.  I hope Puss/Chloe is ok with him.

It's just that since the main point of conflict has vanished (i.e.: Lily hasn't posted here in forever/the night of the DI meeting is, in part, forgotten), I thought to introduce some MORE conflict! Heh, well actually, she wanted to talk to Rosie about some things...not that those things matter anymore, nor do I know how any of this is relevent anymore...  Then again, I'm always jumping to conclusions...you'll see when she gets here, probly not 'til Monday.  But time will tell.

      Whee everyone, whee.  Well I have been explained the Herd. Sweet. I figured it was something along those lines.  To summarize the day after I got home...  Alex called and him and Steven came over, whereafter we pulled sticks from a fallen tree in our yard and battled. I took a few hits to the legs but I gave the point to Alex and Steven a few times. Then Alex lost the keys to his truck and we spent an hour looking for them in the freezing cold. After a while he found  a  key but not  the  key...he left, and after that I grabbed a flashlight and hunted for another half hour or so, but no avail.   And then I got home and started watching  Lord of the Rings , because I had wanted to all week, and drinking Vanilla Coke and stuff.  And NOW I am updating, because I haven't even posted in my own BLog in the past thousand days. At least here I have a computer that works and all.  Sick, Z? I had to play Speed with Will today in 5th, I got my  ass  kicked. It sucked a lot. Becca was in a really bad mood today and I tried to cheer her up the best I could. I know those kinds of days that she was talking about, I heard the same words I had said 1000 times in the past, "I just want to disappear", although in her case it was for the next few hours or so. She presses herself  way  too hard, I think. I hope she'll be ok.  I hope Rosie is having fun at the S&M party with five of her alleged six boyfriends, and I hope Bob isn't bleeding too bad. Heh.  What is this I feel...tired? Must I resign now? I feel to die of shame for this atrocity. AGH. I just had Vanilla Coke, this isn't fair. Especially even after I got some extra sleep this morning and everything. DAMN. I'll just do something to entertain myself for now.  Like rest my eyes.  I'll certainly be back.

      Awww, what Z is trying to say, but won't cause she hates mush, is that we'd miss you, Tao-Tao.  Life wouldn't be the same without you.  And Z, I won't be a legal adult when I go to college... I'll be seventeen, but you're right about the graduating early being a mess...too many horror stories out there for my taste.  And Josh, if you don't ask, one of these days when I'm really bored I will explain the herd.  As I said on my blog, I most likely won't be back at school or church next week.  Sorry yall.  Pass the word along to my other friends (and if you're feeling really generous, my teachers too.  Just the ones we both have.)  Hmmm.  I woke up about 4:45 this afternoon to find that nobody went to school today!!!  I was excited because that means that's one day less I have make up work for!!!  And Rosie, call me if things get too insane around your house.  Your calls entertain me.  And stick with interact...scholarship, remember?  And why take it all out on Will?  What did he do now?  Anyway, I'll see yall later.  I officially have my days and nights confused.  I'm what the zoos refer to as "nocturnal" currently.  But I am getting tired.  I'm going in for more blood work tomorrow to make sure they didn't screw up the diagnosis.  I hope they didn't.  Otherwise, that could mean a trip to the hospital for me to run tests to see what it really is.  Fun, fun.  So I'm going to go to bed now, I do believe.  See yall sometime this month, I hope, I hope. ~Linds

      I hope you don't, Tao-Tao.  I don't think that's the best idea...you'd still only be 16, right?  Or 17.  You wouldn't be a legal adult and it would probably be a big mess.  Anyway...that's all I have to say.  ~Z

      Heh Rosie, you crazy kook, chill out. Never thought I'd say that, but yeah, every day is d i  f f e  r e n  t , as much as they all may suck or get really great, but it's all changing. Chill out.  Graduate next year? Cool.  YEAH I ALMOST HAD IT. Actually, I noticed I missed 10:58 when I first posted it, so I came in, cut the text from the first one, deleted it, and made a new one. The school clock said 10:58, but Blogger said 10:59. Obviously, my frusteration.  So  that's  who they are. I was just curious. As for the Herd...hmm...I'll ask if I think of it.  Kenzie lost  Poor Bastard ...and all of her CDs for that matter. MANY TEARS ARE SHED. But that's ok. "Here at Johnny Rocket's we do service with a smile"...the funniest thing ever said by any man, I'll explain it later. We might go again this weekend, perhaps perhaps.  And there's the bell.  Good day all.

      Oh, 10:59!!!  So close!  OK, to explain: Ronnie is this guy that went to Woodland with me and Becca. He was part of the Herd.  If you don't know what the herd is, it's a long story, get Becca to explain.  He and Rosie know each other because they hang out at Chinese New Year.  Their parents know each other really well too.  Vincent is not important, but if you really want to know, he's Jackie's ex-boyfriend and a friend of mine, kind of.  He's not really important because he doesn't dare show his face at church very often anymore.  Anyway, Jackie still likes him, even though she's engaged.  And to even have a semblence of knowledge as to who Jackie is, you'd have to come to church, because she's just too complicated.  Anyone want to help me out on these explanations? Tao-Tao? Z?  Ok, I'll see yall later.  Oh, and Rosie, I want to see the car!

      Wow...you put Tao Tao.  The point of that name wasn't for your glorification, it was to make fun of you. Please don't take it the wrong way.  And you will turn over. Into a ravine and will blow up and DIE. Have fun!  Umm...I don't think I drank after ye in the past fifty days. Does thinking about it count? I don't think I thought about it either. O well, it doesn't matter, I'm getting sick as is. Have to take Centrum...that shit is REALLY COOL. You could probably take one of those every day and live if only it had some calories in it.   Who's Ronnie? Who's Vincent? Who the hell are these people? I'm confused in my own BLog.  This period is a waste of time.  Do note that I am intentionally posting at 10:58 (or closely whereabouts) to scare those of you who have noticed that most of my posts that do occur in the middle of the day, occur at 10:58.  I don't have a computer right now...damn. If I think of something, it'll be lost for the next few days. My mom works at home, and the state computer networking linkerupper thinger inside the computer is mest, so she has to take it in and get it worked on over the next few days. AGH. Can't do anything at home now. AGH.  O well, that's more quality time with which to read...  AGH.

      Oh, that makes sense (that was in response to my last post.  I keep sleeping through the answer only to find them later.)  And why won't the teachers let you out?  Just because of the whole "sick thing?" Coach King would get you for saying it's like a prison though.  Right Z? ;)  Oh, and I hope none of you drank after me in the past 50 days or so, otherwise, you're gonna be out with me.  I'm watching "The Diary of Anne Frank" on A&E.  Yes, that is just how bored I really am.

      Yeah, that's what Z and I said a lil' before that. Good that you're catching on, yo.  The horrid pull and expulsion of the diseased permeate my silent world. Yeah, everyone's really sick. My whole biology class was deadgone, there were about thirteen people in there today...out of about twenty-nine.  Plus, the teachers are keeping us in the rooms, under STRICT command to let none of us go during class for any reason.  It's like a prison...well it always is, we were always wondering when they'd take the next step, anyway.  Fell asleep a billion times during geometry, gonna go home and take a nap, if European History isn't too bad...and I hear it is, fucking DBQ writing schtick.   Although I probly won't take a nap, I'll get a Coke or something during lunch.  Damn am I stupid.  And nobody answer that either.

      Wow Joah, I knew I was pushing it when I posted the HAHA's but I never thought that you would get THAT mad. Sorry....I wasn't expecting that convers so I decided to let you know about it. Again sorry if it really pissed you off. As to your advise of cutting Gunter off, well it prolly won't happen but I'll try to not pay as much attention as he wants k?  The subject is really getting old.....It's history and if you hadn't brought up the fact that it might not be over, I wouldn't have worried about it. Thankfully all of us have brains so I say history stays there and we never study it again.

      O ok, he said I sounded like a moron.  Now I don't know what the hell Rosie told him, but he had the pointed forwardness to say I sounded like a moron when he has no  fucking  idea about me, living in his little shell of "the world is mine because I'm smart".  I can judge, why, because I've seen people just like him before, number one, and I've heard the stories of what he's done and how he's done things, and I must say it really isn't an impressive personality type by any stretch of the imagination.  Yes, Rosie really loves those resiliant, down-to-earth guys. That was staunch sarcasm, by the way.  When I said drop it, I meant the "HEY IT'S OVER" shit, questions about the past are cool :) ok, just making sure it didn't look like I was biting anyone's head off other than Rosie's.

      SHUT UP.  Rosie, for the love of god, you are  testing  my patience to its fullest. If it really is over, why do you persist in proving to me that it is? Can't it just be over?  There's something in one of you that's trying to say "it's over but it's still ok to act like we were when it was going on". Perhaps inadvertently; however it is superfluous trying to explain this reasoning to your ultimately ineffible logic.  Gunter will still be an asshole, why, because he judged me groundlessly, whereas I had every right to, considering I had all the instances to do as such.   Your insistantce in trying to make me see this eye to eye is worthless.  So is it with me.  So drop it.

      Wellll the NyQuil was a bad idea.  I had nightmares and drunken visions all night, I kept waking up. It was awful. Plus, I got sicker than before. My dad woke me up and sat there talking to me for about half an hour, trying to get me to focus. It worked, but my head still feels like it weight a thousand pounds.  I have a DI meeting today.  And after that I'm coming home, I'm going to do whatever the HELL I feel like doing.  Whee.  Catching up on sleep, probably.  Shit.

      A few things...  Has anyone noticed (especially those of us in foreign language that watch such films profusely) that Disney films still haven't lost their captivity since when we were kids? I just noticed today, we were watching Beauty and the Beast in French today, and even though we couldn't understand a fuckin' thing, I noticed how drawn in I was, and then, when looking around, noticed that everyone was mute with mouths opened. Disney is wayyyyyy too good at what they do.  The Greek language is awesome. I used to know how to say the alphabet in Greek...now I can't. I know a few words now... eu =good,  thanatos =death (thus,  euthanasia ),  khronos =time,  me servaso =something close to "sincerely"...it's a great language. Plus the fact that even though people take Latin, it's  Greek  mythology that gets studied.  And another Valentine's is gone. What a commercial ass holiday. Not that I'd be bitter for crying at home and watching Lifetime, I just hate to see these little sods going out and spending a thousand bucks on each other, only proving that no one is secure in their relationships. Keeping it sentimental with mentality just isn't the way to go anymore. It's more about the image, of course, everyone's succumbed to it, just about. People sicken me.  Die France. I'm REALLY getting sick of French. Fucking language.  Anybody know what "bok choy" means? It's some kind of Chinese cabbage. Just curious.  And all for now.

      Oh, and before I forget...  Leigh Anne tells me that Kevin (yes, the faggot one) tried to send me a Valentine...gay bastard. AUGH. And if it wasn't for her hating him right now, I could be holding a nice lil' red heart with mindless gay profanities upon it, myself braindead and bleeding upon the floor, a crunch-ed and broken mess of a human. HAHA YES, IT WAS RIPPED TO SHREDS. Thankyouthankyouthankyou Leigh Anne.  Why can't the faggots leave me alone?  And just what side of the tree is this guy climbing down anyway?  Whatever.

      Today is going to suck, but that's ok because I'm in a good mood.  No sleep, for one. Another, I have a test in Euro today, and I didn't do any of the homework. But that's ok. I listened to the  Sacred Song  with Kenzie a few times, then I talked to Leigh Anne, and Alex got in there eventually, and we listened to some Metallica ( The Call of ...well...you know), then I went to sleep (on the phone of course), woke up this morning, felt really sick, went to my grandma's, forgot to take vitamin C, but I did have these chocolate Ritz crackers that were awesome.  Last night I played  My Solution  about five times, trying to get it perfect and sing along with it. Why, because we're going for the talent show, and yes, we have a prospective bassist now...Alex wants me to play lead but I'm sure we could find a lead guitarist sooner than the day, which is early March. We have some time. For now though, we have to get some practice, haven't had a session since forever.   I nailed  Solution  by the way. It sounds soooooooo cool, I got some new distortion and a new way of singing the last choruses. Now if Alex can exactly replicate the recorded version when we rerecord/play it live, it's going to be the greatest song ever...plus a new song in place of the second song,  Deadgone , this one's prototype name is  Rage , since  Deadgone  didn't really have much substance, and  Rage  is completely finished. I wrote most of it in 7th grade for a project, and now I've finished it and embellished on it. Nice catchy screaming now. And I got the lyrics done to  All Fall Down .  This is gonna be the weirdest album ever.   If  ever.  I don't have a phone at my dad's anymore by the way, dumb bastard cancelled it to "get his debts under control", so I've got my cellphone...if anybody needs me I'll be there.  And here I am typing and I need to go do Euro.  What a fuckup I art.

So I sat up and looked at the bottom of the bed, and there they were, hung up of course, but also perfectly organized, like...straightened and stuff, right next to each other. How do I know it wasn't someone else? My door was locked. How do I know that someone didn't get in? My mother felt like shit yesterday, she was out at about 7:30, and my sister doesn't know where the key is. It was quite bewildering.   I also had a practical application for the "" today, we were making a program for  Les Miserables  that's going on at the school, and we had to type the name "Thnardier". She was trying to teach us menus and all the people in my row (the geeky tech people and me) were yelling "ALT 130!" for about five minutes until they shot us with tranqs. Ok, not really. But the whole row was bugging out while she ignored them through the menu tutorial.   I was going to send a Valentine heart at school today to Ben through Brooks, but I didn't have the balls to go up there and do it. Alex had a few quarters, we were going to send one for Steven from me (Leigh Anne...are you sure about the whole "bad influences" thing?), again, no balls. And one from Kevin Smith to Stephen Jones, just to scare the poor bastard. But, no funds/nuts. Plus, they wouldn'tve let us anyway, I don't think.  And it's the end of the week, and a long weekend. Saturday's gonna suck though, a bunch of people are coming over to clean up my dad's house once and for all. Which means  I'm  gonna have to do something. Augh. I dunwanna. But hey, I have Monday to compensate.   Friday's gonna be a busy day, too.  Could it be...life has become... interesting , I dare say?  No way.

      Heheh, YES it feels better ANUS.  So now, perhaps I should like...lay out what I do on this site most of the time. If I'm not just talking about random stuff, I'm whining about something, read some of these posts, they got me in BIG trouble. Heh, well, I wasn't expecting to get caught. O well.........the past is the past.  Well, now ye canst say what you wanted to Rosie, and all these people that read it, I'm not exactly sure how many, but I know a remote few. So that's about it. I pretty much use this to vent angst and post songs and kill a few minutes every once in a while, it's fun fun fun.   Sleep time. Well not really. Ok, I go up to my room every night and start reading and then I get tired...I don't  mean  to fall asleep when I close my eyes and put a pillow over my head, I just mean to sit there and think or something...but I end up falling asleep and missing certain persons' phone calls four times in a row. Not that there was a specific case as such...although there was, like, yesterday.  And um...let me think. If I ever say anything about the "dark marks" post, it's about one day when I was really depressed and made my first dark post on my old BLog that got deleted, about stuff that's happened that I overlooked at the time and was starting to see again, i.e. the effects on me from my parents getting divorced, ect. Then there was the weird Thanksgiving posts that were all happy cuz things starting working out, then there was the time around Christmas where I was getting depressed again, then the "letter" which you read, then the "is anything good" post, then  Poor Bastard , the CD made up of songs that deal with me and this website...that's about it, the biggest histoires.   And every once in a while after a few short posts I make a HUGE one like this, although it's never explaining anything like this, it's just me being a lonely old faggot (props to Kenzie for that one). "I want to die because (long list)", you get the idea. It's a great, bright, cheery place.  Eat  my  heart out?  That's all...oh yeah, and I end every post with a short word or phrase. It's tradition.  Sweet.

      Gotta be quick.  I got popped in the eye by Brittany today, it still feels like it's sunken in the back of my skull.  My hair is really weird, too...for some reason it got ULTRA long all of a sudden. Well, to me, anyway. It's everywhere and out of control. I have chronic hair stickage uppage disease (CHSU for short, say), it makes life hell with long hair.  Anyone notice that Black History Month is the one with the least amount of days? It's like saying "Ok, have a month and shut the fuck up," Heh, so what if it's prejudicial, there's no limited White History Month. I can bitch all I want at that blatant act of racism.  I'm not going to have a computer at home for a few weeks, so be not expecting any updates any time soon until fourth. Even these are gonna be short, because I'm really not as interested anymore, and I don't have much time, we actually  do  things in here, versus Mrs. Mallard's class, where we did JACK  SHIT .  Lonely old Badvision, once we knew you so well.  Fare ye well.

      This is a good day too. The annoying guy who sits next to me in this cklass isn't here today.  DI today, that should be a TON of fun. I had a Koke earlier, but I've been watching how long they work on me, and if I drink one right when I get in, I burn out about seventh period, so I figure I'll have an hour after the fact, but some of those strange Khinese foods I  always  am probably going to get over there may help...or s'more Koke or something.    Between Times ...I haven't listened to it today...but konsidering that that's all I've got at my dad's house, this weekend is going to be dedikated to Rotting Khrist. There is the komputer, but there's only so mukh you kan do with no internet. Plus, my dad's going to be  gone  on Saturday, he has a date. So I get to sit at home and listen to Rotting Khrist and other sukh tunes and play Unreal and EVO and other sukh games and watkh a kableless TV in a phoneless house. Sounds like a konstant stream of komplains, non? Well, at least, I'm away from the konstantky of my mom's for a few days.  "I think it's gonna raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain, oh, when I diiiiiiiiiiieeee" said Layne Stayley. Yes it is.  Goodbye all, until Sunday.

      Well, the day is over.  Result: not too bad. I kinda lokked horns with Brooks like I did yesterday. Kid's a fukking retard. It's really bad kuz he thinks he's the smartest person out there, when in fact he misses the point entirely  every time . It really pisses me off when I'm trying to explain to him that we need more information than just history for our Frenkh projekt, and he's waving papers at me, saying, "I've got the history right here dumbass, you're taking too much time, I kould do this SO much better than you," Then he went to the library this morning and fukked with the projekt, "spiffing it up", when in fact all he did was put a fill-effekt on the bakk of every slide, after I took about a YEAR to explain to him that it would look better if we kould find piktures of Lorraine, the region of our projekt, even  Franke  for god's sake. God, SO pissed at that asshole.  And I listened to  Between Times  five times when my mom got home with the K(C)D in her kar today. I was like, "YES!" and listened to it til it was koming out of my ears. And then I listened to  Exiled Ark(c)hangels  and  If It Ends Tomorrow  and  In Domine Sathana . GOD that last song is REALLY messed up. But mostly  Between Times .   I have DI tomorrow. That should be good. Then I'm going to my dad's and I'll probably go to Opry Mills this weekend and see Arthur...heh, "Here at Johnny Rokket's..." et cetera. The dude is HILARIOUS.  Gonna get  A Dead Poem  when I get my next allowance, just to listen to  Between Times . Little obsessed, ain't I? Where has it been all my life?  And I was thinking of great proof that sokiety has bekome ultimately shallow. Anal Kunt...they have an album called  Piknik of Love , there's a song kalled  Saving Ourselves For Marriage , and the lyriks as follows: "We just stood there, wondering what was next / But we knew not to ruin our love with premarital sex". Now obviously, this is a joke, after all, with songs like  I Lit Your Baby On Fire , this guy's an immortality nut, right?  That's  exactly  what I'm talking about, it says nothing about sex in that song, not that you kan understand anything he's saying. Most people just hear his skreaming and say, "Wow, that guy's just wrong in every aspekt. since he's saying  something  about lighting babies on fire, he must have blatant sex,"   Not that I'm denying it, after their song  Rape Women ...heh. Um, but yeah, I bet you took it at face value, you shallow bastard.  Me tiredisimo. Gonna listen to  The Fated Song  a little more and turn in.  Nice.

      Having an unusually good day today.  Kenzie started a language last night called "whahefukk", and I am proud to be a part of it. My new name under  this  language is Gaeshae Antonie Krikkopher Khandler. YES. Notice the lakk of "c"s. Well, sure, I was ranting about it. It was late last night, and we just sat there making up a language.  Yggil qaid dinngy. Bekause I  am  the apple. I'll post it all latr, when I can get to it. It's on a notepad on my Internet-unready komputer in my room. Sadness.   Between Times  is the greatest song ever, I listened to it about a thousand times minus 998 this morning. And I also listened to  In Dominae Sathana , which is also a good song because of the really amazing guitar work. And  If It Ends Tomorrow , and the beginning of  The Fifth Illusion , heh. "AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH,"...I listened to another on there, but I have since forgotten of the name of it, which is espekially gay when trying to put the names on a komputer database.   This day is just  unnatural , it's so good. Probably one of the best I've had in months. I got 100 on a geometry quiz, then I finished my homework in there, I got 100 on a biology quiz, I finished my homework in there, I got everything done for today in study hall, whikh is really happifying since I hardly ever do. Maybe that's the sekret to my depression, to finish all my homework  early  and not have any undue anxiety...  Nah.  A quikk random thing, the prinkiple of tires. Now, tires akt upon the funktion of gripping the road, mukh like a train grips the trakk. If you lose that grip (as I did during the last snow), there's no hope for you, exkept to hope to start gripping before you hit something. And in my case, I ran off the road. But that prinkiple of aktually holding to the road, as if we were on a trakk...awesome. And gay at the same time, I should know, since I did it, ran straight off the road, off a little hill. Some dudes kame and helped us push the kar out though, so it was ok.   Hope it keeps raining through the weekend, even though I'll be doing nothing at my dad's all that time, I enjoy the rain. Go listen to  Between Times  a few dozen times and drink some Kherry Coke and play EVO. Bones and ashes of my formerly komplicated life of talking on the phone konstantly.  Actually, I konsider this an evolution, since  while  being on the phone, I am also doing all these other things, NIK(C)E. Why kouldn't I see it before, exkluding my life from my sokiality probably would've ended me, had I not done something about it, which I did subkonkiously. I'll look bakk on myself one day and laugh.  Ha fukking ha.

      God,  Between Times  is sukh a great song. It reminds me of rain, and I view rain as quite sakred. I would post the lyriks if they could convey the intensity of this song, but I don't think I kould do anything to give it justice. Just go download, I'll  pay  you to download it...ok not really. But you just  have  to hear it, at least the intro.  This song is starting to skare me. Yet again, I'm going to go upstairs and listen to it and try to memorize the lyriks. They're really hard on this one. I mean, I got  A Dead Poem  about the first day I listened to it, and  Sorrowful Farewell  the first time I read the lyriks. The rest of the songs are pretty unimportant lyrikally...well, ok,  Glory of Sadness ...and there's also the opening lines to  Khronos  whikh sound only too terribly kool: "Origin of time / The fak(c)e of old flesh / Devours the earth / My feet and brain"...what does it mean, NOTHING, why is it kool, BECAUSE IT IS. the word "flesh" is awesome as is, they should replake the word "skin" with "flesh" permanately and for all uses.  The guitars and drums in Rotting Khrist are aktually pretty amazing work. The drummer is just inkredible. He's primarily a "machine gun drummer (of course, first heard in reference to Rotting Khrist)", but just to hear that level of ability...inkredible. And the fact that guitarist/singer Sakis sings and plays with songs like  Glory of Sadness ,  Lex Talionis ,  Coronation of the Serpent ,  Exiled Ark(c)hangels ...they're all really pretty fast. The bassist pretty mukh does what the guitars do, which is nonetheless outstanding. And then there's the lead, whikh is both melodikal and fast. What a kombo...now sometimes it's more melodikal, but  what's the differenke ?   How kould I ever kome to love this band with its demon shrieking singer and mishmash musik?  Heh, "mishmash" is a kool word, too.

      Allo kompatriots.   Another kool language is German, for the word  Oktoberfest , just because of that "k". I love "k"s, it's the greatest letter. I think I'm going to start replaking all my "c"s with them. So if you see a "k" where a "c" should be, you'll know.  This is quite a kondeskenkion (that's a hard one) of the English language, but I feel it kompletely within my kontrol to manipulate this konfusing yet komprehensive tongue as I see fit, so there.  Actually, the "k" is a lot kooler  within  the word...I would show you the thing, it was on the  urlLink Rotting Khrist website  but not anymore...but there's still kool stuff to see, like some of the tour spots: THESSALONIKH, YDROGEIOS, don't know exaktly where they are or whikh is the equivalent of a kounty or whatever, but there they are. The kommon "yd/ygg" tekhnique is pretty kool too, as in "yggdrasil".  Wait a sek...what the hell am I doing...talking about "k"s and other fun stuff. It's time for the depressing part. And surprisingly, it's not on my part.  Really, you know who you are, just remember I'll be here all night, and I'm pretty mukh awake all that time...I know some other parties will be upset, but...gods...sakrifikes have to be made, I guess. Wonder where my loyalties will lie...it doesn't matter...to whom it may konkern, if you need any help, you know the number.  My dad doesn't have internet or a fukking  phone  anymore, it's SO gay. But I'm going over there anyway. Youse guys know my k(c)ell and whatnaught. I'd hate to push another number on you, I know you have about a thousand of mine as is. Sorry my family sukks.  I have a new favourite song (did you like that extra "u"? I'm overhauling my entire language), what a surprise. This time it's Rotting Khrist's  Between Times . It aktually goes on my beautiful songs list...can you believe it, just the beginning, it's so deep and weird sounding that it kan be klassified as such. It's like  Khronos  (natural "k"!), it makes me feel weird...it's just that  Between Times  actually sounds nice.   I ordered  Khronos  the other day, by the way. I wanted  A Dead Poem , but my dad was ordering off of   urlLink half.com , and  urlLink half.com  didn't have  any  kopies of their  most famous album ...I guess it's kuz they're so rare as is that the most known one goes fast...uh, yeah, that was rokket skienke. O well, for the less analytikal.  That reminds me, Russian has a lot of "k"s.   Ok, that's enough. I swear, I kan't be serious when I'm dong a komplete vokabularian overhaul. Aren't I weird?  Yes.

      Wow.  I woke up today feeling like it was going to be the worst day ever. So I went on like that for a while, just moping around, and then came study hall in first. I took a nap and now I feel...incredible. A lot less sick than this morning, but still sick, but I can prevent it, I think.   But I feel really tired. Thinking I'm going to have to drink some poison/caffeine to stay awake tonight. God, I don't like what that shit does to me. But I love it so.  It smells like popcorn, this school is weird.

      And today...  A HUGE session, it lasted about five hours, during which we only played about 2 1/2... but  we finished  Little Rhyme , actually started on  Bitter . It sounds cool, but a little too slow for me.   And Alex has succumbed to the poisonous melodies of Rotting Christ. We were talking about "machine gun drumming" (the first time I'd ever heard that phrase was in reference to Rotting Christ), and I said, "The greatest machine gun song ever is  Glory of Sadness ," then I attempted to play it on guitar and failed, but got the point across. Then I just started talking about all of their hard songs, mostly the ones on  Khronos  (which I ordered this weekend, whoo!), and especially about the one  If It Ends Tomorrow . He heard it and was like "...God,". And then we sat in my mom's car discussing the fact that if the singer was gone, the band would be great. I argued against it, saying the lyrics wouldn't work if it all wasn't screamed like he did. For instance...in  If It Ends Tomorrow ..."If it ends tomorrow / If it begins / It gives me no sorrow / No tears fall to my lips"...or how about  Glory of Sadness ..."I was straight asleep / It was that night / I fell into it so deep / Then I saw the light"...it just wouldn't work without the screaming like he does. And then the suggested (my mom and Alex) that the words be changed. And I said no. They're Rotting Christ, you can't expect them to talk about anything else except touchy, mostly religious subjects and emotions of fear and sorrow. C'mon.  But Alex liked  If It Ends Tomorrow , nonetheless.  And I played Counterstrike and EVO all weekend. It was a lot of fun, especially when my cousin called (kinda surprised)...since his mom was over at my house this weekend and noticed me playing Counterstrike the whole time, she told Seth and he call, all excited that I was playing. So play we did. He showed me the coolest maps EVER, fy_pool_day, and battlefield_rush. He also talked about d_day, which I've looked at since but haven't played yet. I would this weekend if it weren't for DI...it's keeping me at home this weekend. Sadness.  I had a fun weekend.   But this week is gonna suck.

      Counterstrike is a fun game, did I ever mention?  I played with Seth today, and probably am going to again before the night is over. For anyone that plays,  the  map is fy_pool_day. It's the most fun I've had since owning Alex on Aztec last weekend.  It was the same scenario this morning as yesterday, I woke up dead, no NyQuil this time though. And then my dad asked me, "Want anything dude?" and I was like..."Yeah...get me some Crunch Berries," So the balance of my morning was spent eating Crunch Berries and reading a collector's comic my dad borrowed from this fanbody at his office, called  The Punisher , it was really sick, the last chapter was through the mouth of this guy getting some teeth worked on, a mob guy, and suddenly The Punisher shows up and knocks all his teeth out, it is SO sick.  Gross.  More later, Seth called back.  FunFUNfUN

      Rotting Christ once said, "It took an instant; the struggle was sharp...I remember what you had said: the challenger will prevail,"  And so it is true, in a many of ways, 'tis true. And  why  is this?  SECOND PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SECOND PLACE MEANS  VICTORY !!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND NOW...................  State, and this time, we have plenty of time to work on it. Today was a sweep for us, considering the amount of effort prior and our total improv times before...we actually ran  over  the time limit. But it didn't matter, we still beat out Centennial even if they did finish. Which means we can clean up at state with some work.  At first I had thought we were counted down on teamwork because of my showoffishness...then I remembered Franklin's "Harp Girl", who did almost the same thing. So I guess it was simply that we were first, and set as a standard against the rest. That definitely contributed to our downfall...well, perhaps that's too strong of a word. With our work, we could've had first.  I must say, "GO TEAM!", we were fraggin' GREAT compared to the beginning, where we figured we were going to be slaughtered and abdicated from a mere shot at state. So we won by default, we still got  second  and went  first .  So...Sarah, Will, Elizabeth, Rosie, even Lindsey for the first practice, and me too!,  HURRAH! CONGRATULATIONS!

      This is the day.  I feel a twist of nausea permeate the recesses of my box of a soul, filling the life force therein, corrupting the stuff of mortal existence with unescapable, tumultuous urges to vomit whatever went undigested from the past week or so. As I sit here at this monitor, being bombarded by light gamma rays or whatnaught, eating some leftover chips from my last meal at my grandmother's, and sipping a Cherry Coke with bemused fervor, I feel it, that twisting, serpentine hand of fear disassembling the scraps of my rationality, decaying the origins of my learning and assimilation of scenarios. I feel screwed.  Last night I was assigned to get duck tape for the DI team. Little did we remember, and my grandmother  did , that we are in the middle of a "fear terrorism" mentality and people have bought all duck tape and plastic with which to secure windows against the threat of viral warfare.  People, if the germ wants in, it'll  get  in, don't worry your poor, illogical, and incoherent heads.  With the two rolls given to me by my grandmother, and the one I found at the store while stocking up on  my  antiterroristic formula, caffeine, it gives us a grand total of SCREWED. The ones given me are strange...one is huge and yellow, while the other roll is...dirty. It has particles all over it.  Most likely, however, we have enough.  I woke to my  sister's  alarm clock, who, by the way, isn't at this house this weekend.  It's Getting Hot In Herre , the slut anthem of the new millenium, blasting through her open door, the new cat, Camille, scratching on mine. I was frankly overwhemled by this chaos...bombs really are louder in the morning, especially to teenage boys who  sleep . I rolled out of bed, scratching my frazzled scalp and rubbing the sleep for my eyes as I headed to the pandemonium out there, the Leviathan of noise called Nelly.   After five minutes of experimenting on how to turn off the alarm clock in the dark, and achieving my goal (worse, it happened to be my old one), I walked to the shower as slowly as possible, dreading the dire results of it ending. So, using your powers of deduction, one could ascertain that this shower consumed a quantity no less than that of the Nile's daily flow of water for five thousand years. As it ended the anxiety of which I spoke settled in on my shoulders and started shaking me, choking my being to mutate into a child of his disorder. Staving him is getting sufficiently harder with every glance at the clock, and seeing as how computer have said wonderful device  somewhere  on every screen, his iced grip colds my being with the seconds that wake.  The tick, tick, the incessance of the clock begins to drive me to chaotica, a state of complete euphoric insanity, humanity enveloped with the penchant to destroy in a mad and fearful wake. The tick is louded now, slower, it multiplies and divides faster than its amoebic kin (or is becoming as such at this point), I see my fingers smashing the keys at tremendous speeds, letting the blood from each repeated strike dance upon my lined, tired visage, my heart quickens, my brain begins thinking sans rationality, but with much in speed that the normal self would desire.  The world commences spinning out of control, the clocks are a wall of noise, my heart, on the verge of imploding on itself with its unending repetetions, the bag, once full of chips, both cheesed and plain, now on my head, suffocating my burning lungs, and the suffocation is a release from the madness, but soon becomes another twisted limb of its endless desire to give birth  again  to, to whelp  again , to create one new life in the masses of a sentient being   again  .   >   a<>> >>>i<>>>  F A L L S  into oblivion and their is much of stark contrast between the constantcy of fixed human shape and his now boiling thoughts. He is on the verge of  ! ! EXpl.......od###ing into pieces, or at least he feels as such, the strength accrued over the course of his now shortened 15 years drained and sucked dry in a matter of seconds, the vampire(DOTH STOCK YE) consumes his mind and again he  F A L L S  into darkness this time, and he feels the warmth of EUPHORIA, in nomine, ave euphoria, carry me away on your lusty back, your thoughts intuned to naught but contentment, the soul waits in purgation as the body, soulless but with none to control its spirit but nature  UNL EASH ES?  a veritable  Gotterdammerung  upon the nations of earth, moreover upon his house, now being pummeled by unquenched human REWOPpower as it consumes his form, even death is an illusion, even death is a puppet deathisminedeath is my lovesheismy lover and i am the king and OBLIVION is my servant and suddenly  I realize, it was from drinking caffeine this early in the morning. I pick up the fallen bag and throw the can in the sink, where it, like everything on the planet, will be washed and recycled in time. Nature prevails once again, she replenishes both herself and the spirit of those upon her. And for me, rationality has prevailed once again.  I, with rushing spirit and unconquerable indomitablity, and a MAJOR surge of caffeine, forth into the unknown, I ride the winds of creation into a new age, one of competetion not of feats of strength and show, but of the minds, where thought is the strongest weapon, and thoughts gauge themselves in power with each mind. Together, they are weapons of feared power, or they are unstable, as atoms, fickle bonds apt to split in seconds.  I feel the warm coils of my mentality slide back into place. Now with the surging thoughts and enforced spirit  I am  invincible .

It's as if I owe everyone something, as if there is no one else but them and I owe my entire lives to these people. And because of that, do any of you think I move anymore, do you think I breathe anymore, or live? Do I do anything? Of course not, I'm too afraid that if I do,  someone  is going to get pissed off at me.  And no, all of you "fickle Joshua" people, this isn't just about Leigh Anne. This is about Alex and Nick and Rosie and scores, LEGIONS of others. They all expect me to "their" Josh when in fact I am simply struggling to be "my" Josh. I don't owe any of you  anything  past my friendship and occasional undivided attention, and I make damned sure of that every single second. I don't owe you an expected personality, nor do I owe you what you are wanting to hear versus what I am going to tell you. By god, I'm going to say what  I  want. Because obviously the rest of you are taking these rights, and I have EVERY FUCKING PEROGATIVE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD TO DO THE SAME FUCKING THING. I'm not for you, I'm for me, just as is everyone else. I have thoughts, I want them to be heard. I have ambitions, I want them to draw breath no matter how foolish they are. I want  me . It's what I've wanted all this time isn't it? I wanted to be my own rather than a servant to my thoughts. It's becoming severely impaired as of late. If I think of or talk about person A then person B gets angry or starts prodding at me, and vice versa. Now throw about a thousand more letter combos in there, welcome to my life.   I'm sure Philip could attest, the poor guy, he has every right not to give a fuck about Becca or Rosie, either and both. He could just say "Goddamit, get  away  from me you fucking psychopaths," in not so many words, and I would applaud him and pat him on the back, and if he said the same to me I would just nod and walk away. Why, because Philip is exercising his right to liberation. Non serviam, do you all know what that means?  I serve no man . And that's exactly right. I'm getting fucking FED UP with this mental servitude, these shifting alliances. All of my friends hate each other foundlessly and SOMEONE AT THE FOCAL POINT GETS  TORN TO PIECES  because of it. I owe  THEM , no, I owe  THEM . That's what I felt like in the first post on this BLog, I just didn't know how to voice it, but now I see it so clearly that it sickens me to death.    TO ALL OF YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW: I  DESIRE  YOUR GOING TO HELL IF YOU THOUGHT FOR ONE SECOND I WAS YOURS TO COMMAND, IF YOU THOUGHT THAT I OWED IT ALL TO YOU, GO TO HELL AND GET THE  FUCK  AWAY FROM ME . How  DARE  any of you impede upon my right to live, how  DARE  any of you find my thoughts on people and things as false, HOW  DARE  YOU CONTROL ME. I'm sorry to death, but I have no pity for those of you who would look upon this post as a meer fit of rage. It's about time I woke up and started listening to reality. Lindsey, for instance, she NAILED one night when she called. I don't remember anything, hardly anything, but I remember it being along these lines, perhaps not intentionally but it got there to me. And perhaps that wasn't what she wanted me to get out of it, but it is what I  am  getting out of it.  So goddamned tired of feeling the fool for everyone else. I will not be yours.  Non serviam.

      The song  Non Serviam  is weird.   Comes from the album of the same name, it's just weird; traditional Rotting Christ, but weird. I don't like it.   So the deal is, DI is going to  eat  this entire weekend. All Friday, all Saturday, I won't get home 'til 1498247591275 o'clock on Saturday. And I'll be carrying about a thousand Cokes with me too. So I'll be completely psyched out for the competetion. It's going to be fun and stupid. Mostly since we're heading into almost certain defeat with nearly cheery countenances.  My family is a bunch of warmongers.  Again, I hear the corruption running rampant in my loyal coruptees. It's actually getting to be a guilty pleasure. And I know that those involved will use such prhases as "WELL! See if I (insert actions here) again!" Those actions are mostly "talk to you". And of course, in five minutes, they do.  REMEMBER, YOUR CORRUPTION IS YOUR OWN AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR IT, I DON'T GIVE ANY OF THIS SHIT VOLUNTARILY, I AM COAXED TO IT. SO SHUT UP .  My bum hurts. Stupid cats.  And PRAY for me this weekend. Just hope, at least, that I don't go mad from the anxiety. I neglected to mention to the team that I am a dunce in public competetions.  Whoops.

      Ummm, I just remembered something.  I was convicted with corrupting  another  girl yesterday. She's about the seventh girl claiming as such.   It really bother me since my dad was the same, and if any of you know anything about my dad, you'd agree that you really wouldn't want to be walking that path. It's interesting, true, but it sort of plays on my angel/devil complex at the same time. Yes, even I can have a sensitive spot towards formerly innocent girls whom I have turned to sex by any means.  Jeezus, makes it a lot worse thinking of it that way.  O wow.

      Today was also cool. It took long enough to get that way.  It was deemed, as I woke, that we would be two hours late. This is gay, though I, as I took my shower and sat around. I entered in  Khronos  into my WinMedia database and played some guitar, also took some time to listen to those wonderful satanic ballads. Then, our despair closed in as, despite a profuse and deep iced rain, they would not call us even and let us out.   So we were walking out the door when, for the fifth time that morning, we got a call. My grandmother had the guile to inform us that school was out. Preposterous, we said, we checked it just five minutes ago. LIAR. Although channel three was a black screen, and we assumed they were changing it so that, just secretly, we agreed with our grandmother that they really  did  close it. The first channel we came to said au contraire, still two hours late.   After much of this lollygagging, I just said, "Turn it to channel three again,", where we were greeted with the much-loved "Get the FUCK outta here!" sign/"School is closed for Wednesday, February 26, 2003" Powerpoint slide. That was enough for us.  I called my cousin, who was expecting us any minute and shouted the good news. He called back about two seconds later, shouting every blasphemy possible against the school system, with which I shouted all the ones he missed. Then Alex called and I put off the session, I suppose, at the very moment, as my mom wouldn't drive that far in the ice, despite how little ice it was. I went to Seth's to play the updated Counterstrike. We played that stuff alllllllll day, then we played Team Fortress and kicked ass/got our asses kicked on there. We cooked a pizza, and just as it was done, my mom called and says "We're getting Nick and Jerry's (or some two names, it just really good pizza that you have to cook yourself, youse goys know what it is), you guys want some?" And Seth was preaching the goodness of those pizza persons, so we put the cooked pizza in the 'fridge and waited for mother. Then we had some of that pizza which was really good, and I went home.  So I go up to my room and started typing a George Washington Carver essay, I got it done for the most part, and I started reading. Then I felt more tired than I ever have in my life, I think. I put down the book and passed out for about three hours. When I woke up, I hear the phone ring about five times. I didn't even budge, I just pick'd up the book and went back to reading. I went downstairs later, where I heard dinner was being made; then I took control of the computer and here I am, typing this completely pointless essay on my life. I just wanted to type a bit. I'm probably just going to go back to sleep in a minute, I'm serious. I think I have lethargy disorder; it was brought to my attention as I noted my nap from yesterday.   So *yawn* all. And tons of scary shit this weekend.   It makes me hope we lose.

      Today was cool.  I woke up dead. Then I walked out in the hall and heard "no school". Then I went back and laid down. Then I got a call three hours later, "DI".  Fuck.  So then I get back from that and go back to sleep, and then go to lessons only to find out I have no lessons. So I go home after waiting 1000 years for my sis to get out of hers. Then I go home and am sitting here tying this now. Kind of pissed off, if you realized.  I'm going to sleep, this week has been hell as is.  Sorry for lakk of k-age.  God.

      I met the koolest person through Leigh Anne last night. Her name is Rondel Linder, she lives in Australia.  Quite possibly the smartest person I have ever met...very, very cool. She gave me a few titles that I'm going to have to kheck out, mostly about European history and psychology. She's really analytikal and not judgmental at all, which surprised me quite a bit, konsidering the hordes of smart people I know that take everyone at face value.  I wish I liked making ultra-emotional posts now...I could make a great one, sinke today is sukking. But I probably won't. I'll just go home and suffer in silenke.  "Yeah, it goes away," says Layne Staley.  That's like the second time I've quoted Layne as the bell was ringing.  Weird-o.

      I got  Khronos  this weekend! Yes!  Well, it's pretty good. Now, I've got a little beef with this song,  My Sacred Path , it uses the lyriks of parts of the songs  Glory of Sadness  and  If It Ends Tomorrow ...weird. And the inside art work is...just weird. But it's a good album. I listened to  Glory of Sadness  first off.  But then I spent the rest of the weekend listening to  Between Times , and it's AWESOME still. Ok, getting bored with it a little. But, I kan't bring  Khronos  with me anywhere, konsidering the rotting, krukified Jesus on the cover. Shit.  Getting  A Dead Poem  next. I WANT IT.   Elftown is funny.  G'bye.

      Perhaps we're not so dead as we thought.  After sitting there playing the wonderful song about a thousand times in a row, I believe we have finally come to be a musical power, a force uncontained. I believe we are fully ready...I can hear Alex constantly insisting on our talent show dominance. I've been over here since after school Friday, think of nothing but this song, perhaps slacking off for long periods of time, but nevertheless, my brain is in these notes, my thoughts are in my voice screaming into that microphone decorated with a black ribbon and Rosie's bracelet, surrounded by a thin veil of the unused yellow duct tape from the DI competition. Everywhere I step there is rubber or metal, everything smells like machine or burning or oil or something to that effect, the smell of mechanization, the scent of our music, I suppose. It's invigorating, actually.  And after so much hard work, there is still so much to go wrong. Tyler goes to Georgia tomorrow, what if he becomes stuck there? What if I cannot pull off a prerecorded bass track before the time? My amp permanently shorted out today, so we're taking the Marshall...supposing, in getting it, we take too long and show up too late? We have up to 4:40 to show up, which means we must be gods in our speed, o Hermes, I invoke ye. Whatifwhatifwhatif...I think too much. Chances are things are going to go off without too much of a hitch and we either fail to get in or go for the glory. Sort of scared, I've too much confidence that we're going to make it...I have a lot of faith in this song, I always have. And now...  God, preserve me. I have so much on my mind.  Yesterday my dad came over, I decided to dump the woes of my agony at our finding Tyler inept. That was about the point I started screaming every obscenity I have ever known for the entire world. At the top of my lungs, with Alex and Tyler and my dad standing close at hand laughing. And after, so did I. And then, I foolishly accepted a shot of chocolate liquer and passed out drunk at about 11 last night.  No  alcohol tolerance. But that's besides the point. I was screaming as loud as I could, exactly the words  no one  wants to hear, and I have never ever felt better.  And this weekend, I have been more tired than I have ever been in my entire life. So much work...so much, and for what? To win? I don't think that's what I've been after all this time. I think it was all just to prove that I could do it, to get up on stage and stare down a hard-ass crowd. To prove myself. To prove to even myself that I can do it. And winning is simply an extremely necessary byproduct. To feel that adrenaline rush. To take in the crowd and make them mine. Basically, to feel that selfish and piggish desire that I'm better than everyone else because  I have a band and I wrote a song and I sing and play guitar, not the best, but shit  you can't do it  .  And that's what I feel like right now. Everything else is forgotten. Were you to call me right now, anything you would say would be answered by a line from  My Solution . "Hello, Josh?""BANG MY HEAD AGAINST THE STONE COLD FLOOR,""What?""Asylum  was  the answer,""What the hell are you talking about?""That I break free from this cage,"  Someone help me. Heheh, a pleasureful pain.   urlLink Nitokris nitokris . I dunno.

      Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them. The good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it is a grevious fault, and greviously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man, so are they all, all honorable men) come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice offered him a kingly crown, which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, but here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him? O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason! Bear with me, my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause 'til it come back to me.  Now, if I can do this in seventh period.  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them. The good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it is a grevious fault, and greviously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, (for Brutus is an honorable man, so are they all, all honorable men) come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought man prisoners home to Rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that at the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, but here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him? O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason! Bear with me, my heart is in that coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause 'til it come back to me.  Just practicing, not obsessed over it. Wish me luck.

      "Vague thoughts torture my head," said Sakis...right now he is correct.  The song  Between Times  has come back for me again, and now the words are getting to me, now that I understand them; after, of course, reading them on a website,  urlLink darklyrics.com , which includes the wonderful band Bal-Sagoth, with wonderful titles such as  In The Raven Haunted Forests Of Darkmier Where The Sun Does Not Shine And The Trees Eternally Choke The Light  or something to that effect, times every song on their album. But that is besides the point.  "The drums of time have stopped, the ecstatic quietude," and I feel it, this quietude that drove me to a strange feeling this summer, and over Leigh Anne this year, it is the force, the demon, upon my shoulders that tells me to keep fighting and to make things so much worse than they are. It is a strange fate for one that could want so much from people and, in the end, with his demon, leave little to be desired.  This quiet hasn't yet settled back in, but with enough time it will. It doesn't readily trouble me as of yet; rather, I feel its fingers and feel the breath of its whispers. It never hurts me, only it works on me until I forget who I am.  But mostly, I feel it because I see its poison working its way out of me and on to those around me as repercussions of my actions. Scorn, mostly, well deserved, but scorn nonetheless. To whom it may concern:  Whether or not your actions are deserved of my contempt are unbeknownst to me, simply I am the messenger of voices I have held back far too long, voices that I believe to be true, and not voices of my own conception, these are other people I have held back again and again. The conflict has dissolved to loyalties now, truly; there can be no middle ground for you and I, make well known this, without someone else's dissention. Be aware that there was a reason for the things I have done, and a reason for why I keep you away now.  I have come to a point in life where there is a parting of paths, "now that there is no good escape", the paths have forked, and now I sit at the crossing of the roads and wonder as to which I shall take now. And perhaps, to go back, and see how far I have come...or perhaps, not to go at all, as it seems to me that the agony is upon everyone else and not myself at this point...although the wolves stalk at the sun sets...or rather, I cannot stay in one place too long and be safe.  Over anything, I wish I could be the totally uncomplicated me, not this romantic prodigy, shaped by society and its nuances and projections of love, love, that tepid desire, oh greatest and most destructive creation of man, the want of other humans, that which finally did bring us out from shadow, the essence of love.  Love is actually not a human invention...the concepts behind it are, but as for the emotion, a product of (creation? evolution?) existence. And, sadly and sorrowfully, and especially for me, who would resist it as of now, it is inevitable.  And thus the sun sets on another age and my understanding of the nature of life goes blurry again, a wheel of color, and I, to focus on one color and see what it may bring, be it love, be it conflict with the world, be it conflict at home, be it the same color as before, and the story as of now continues, the neverending chronicles of a man stricken with nameless emotions that interferes with all that he does...or perhaps, a modified version of that tale, where he has control of his existence.  Sorry for all the symbolism, somehow it tends to well up in periods of intense thought, as I am having now, and later, when I read through all of this, I can at least make a bit of sense out of it.  Blurry, love, struggle, it all comes around.  Again, that is.

      The house is deathly quiet.  Again, and since the end of Sunday, the house has died early and was born the next day early, it is woken by light every morning now. Even the clouds are lit with the early sun. It's as if the entire world has changed.  But now as I have turned off my amp for the fifth time, I have unhooked the mic and taken it down, it being ready for the session tomorrow, the one that may decide my future, I can't help but hearing that definitively speaking silence, its slow and subterfuged voice calling out across the night and the overcast sky, across my deadbox room, into my brain, and there it pounds its strange drums and chants its strange tune and tells me now to write about it and compose a ballad for its continued life, and it says that after all is said and done, and the age of existence is over, he will reign above all, silence who is golden shall have his crown when the aeon of time is up.  It was this silence that motivated me to write this post. I stood from my bed, reading as I have the past few nights, and came to the bathroom, looking into the great mirror there for the first time in, it seems, a long time. Where hence has this face come from? The only thing that has remained the same of this aged face are the eyes that still call out even to me. They have stayed forever as a haunting testament to my person, that ever shall all know that once and before I am Josh and shall ever be. But this face...  The face that glimpsed this same mirror ten years ago and knew, "I am me," and thought none the different. The face that, only years later, would, tear-strewn, look into this same mirror as his most beloved pet died, as his aunt was pronounced dead in a hospital, and that he was subjugated to stay at home for the funeral, the same mirror and the same face that said, "Your parents are not each other's any longer", the same face that, upon a beach miles away, had sun-burnedly grinned into a sunset and drew hearts into sand with a girl that he no longer recalls, and three years later, to do the same, the same boy who had walked the streets of Nashville, bemused with the life of the city at night, the same face that, sitting on his grandmother's porch with his best friend, had screamed and cried out for An, for something, to avenge his deepest heart's betrayal, the same heart that was betrayed by his father and gave forth the same cry, the same heart you have seen now. The same face that has cried, has laughed, has sighed and fallen to musing, has raised its eyebrows in shock, and has given everyone anything it could.  And today, there was the face in that same mirror again, the mirror where all of this had started, and there I was as before. "I am me," it had said, "but I am more than that, as well. I am myself, and I am my friends, I am my lovers, I am my shadow, I am my music, I am  everything  that surrounds me, and still, and above all of this, I am me."  And somehow, despite the strange, long-haired ghost in that mirror, the pale-faced, sunken-eyed boy that stood and stared back answered, "And I am you, as well," and had smiled despite his terror at being insane, he did not care, the mirror smiled and he smiled back, and his mind had spoken to him and he had answered as if it were common, content with the answer, and had fallen silent. If there was one thing I have ever learned it is it:   the face above is as much as the face beneath   The face of my life is here as well as within. As if by magic, I am something else again.  But still I am me.

      Never mind that last post. I got the answer, albeit vague. Although I don't think that has  anything  to do with the general outcome of this situation.  Time to make a quick long post. The talent show is coming up on the twenty-first, as if I haven't made mention of it about a thousand times already. Tryouts are on Monday...with, quite possibly, the biggest cramming session in music we've ever had this weekend. Especially Friday, I'm going to see if I can somehow get out of it Saturday and go to my dad's...he was sort of upset last night when I told him I might be staying here for the weekend. It's terrible to have to be so torn over one weekend's decision, when after this I have all of my weekends freed. Now to decide where my loyalties lie...over a Coke, perhaps? Definitely.  And I still haven't had any sleep all week. It's because of the dreams, not horrifying to any degree, just constant dreaming every single night. Perhaps inhibited by the phone? For the past few nights, since Sunday, in fact, my nights have been plagued with these dancing apparitions, and every time I remember waking up and thinking about them, but soon falling back asleep and forgetting their purpose entirely. At first I thought it was the Cokes, drinking them and going to sleep straight away afterwards, but since I have come to find, as of last night, that they are simply there, perhaps thoughts waiting to be dissembled in my head, perhaps days waiting to be repeated. It's been a long time since I've been off of the phone this long...about six or so months. In fact, I slept just fine when it was with me, and now, sans plastic wedged in my ear, one would think  au contraire , but I suppose now.  And I'm already having an allergic reaction to this new acne medicine I'm on. It's a supposedly "less stomach irritants" form of the other pill, Minocycline, but this new stuff, Doryx, is causing even worse pain than the Minocycline, and I'm even eating something substantial with this pill, like I was supposed to and didn't on Mino. Even when I was on Mino and ate, it still got to me, which is why they, extremely quickly, cancelled my perscription.   It looks like a hell of a week.  Let's hope it stays that way and doesn't become hell on earth.

      Thanks for posting, whee! It's nice to have some company on here.  Well, what does Tyler know? That we want him, yes, but for the talent show auditions on  Monday ? How'd he find out?  And second...heheheheh. Ok, so I had a little episode on the bus whereafter I was given a little slip of paper by a kid which read "Mental Help Line, 333-333". Tomorrow, I'm going to threaten to beat him up because I was on the verge of hanging myself and instead I killed my cat, or something like that. It'll be so much fun, I've always hated that kid for some reason. But yes, I started screaming at the top of my lungs at the absolutely TERRIBLE songs on the radio. GOD I HATE NO DOUBT AND WHOEVER THAT OTHER ASSHOLE WAS I FORGOT BUT THEY STILL  SUCK .  And as for mentioning that website...haha. It's going to take a lot of explaining.   How'd you enjoy all these wonderfully outrageous and long posts, chock full of teenage hormonal ambition and such? Bet you sat there going "oh god" at the beginning of all of them, because I still sure do.  The end...sort of.

      So, joshua Anthony Chandler, it has finally happened.  I have finally read all your bloggs, and now I can finally RESPOND!  All i have to say is this:  Thank you for your insight into the situation of the death of my grandfather and the meanings of my feelings.  Also I would like to thank you further for FINALLY writing about le anne (and yes i know i spelled her name wrong).  You needed to do it for a long time, and she needs to realize that you still do have strong feelings for her, that you still love her, and that if she would just FUCKING STOP FLIRTING WITH A THOUSAND GUYS that you wouldn't feel so insecure, argue, and FINALLY be able to treat her the way you want to.  I would like to firther state that  ROSIE a.k.a. Tao-Tao is in fact a bitch, and that if she had not FUCKED with both of your minds you probably would still be together right now, maybe even had reached the graveyard, perhapes? (Yes, I know they both read our blogs; that's why I write this without fear.)

      Brittany posted today. Someone stop time for me to cry an ocean of joyous tears.  Well, even with an incomplete set and a song still 20 seconds overtime,  Stranglebox  is going to try out for the talent show. That would be myself, Alex Blonder, and the unassuming Tyler Schaub, who has no idea that he's in yet. Hahah. We're doing  the  practice this weekend, lasting from Friday to the end of Saturday, taking the Playstation 2 out of the practice room and locking the door, taking five minutes for a break every hour. And if all goes to plan, that should be a good twelve hours at least. I hope we don't crack under the pressure. We have to teach Tyler the part before Friday, and somehow cut 20 more seconds before the tryouts. Monday, Monday, Monday.  Today was the  day  of days. Mostly, it started in fifth when I was getting beaten up everywhere, the world was a flurry of blows and shouts of tumultuous laughter. It ended when I fell back into a wall and ripped one of Mr. Adams's posters a bit, with many a witness. Before this, there was a test in the class which I am nearly positive that I did horribly on, plus the fact that I didn't do the homework, sacrificing that for the last few months of lost sleep. But that was the start of it. After this came sixth period, where I found a bit too late of a quiz in the class, but knew for the most part. Moreover, I was becoming tired, and now I have forgotten most of what was said, a summary of a quiz for tomorrow's sixth period.  In seventh, we had yet  another  quiz I did not study for, only failing to pull an answer for two, one of which was left blank, the other, a drastic, last minute guess, and both answers of which I was unable to find in the book. Then I remember the book test on this book, which is  Monday , same as the talent show tryouts, and a report on plants  Tuesday , both of which I have failed to start on. And here I am making a BLog post, and after this, I'm going to bed. Surprise that my laziness statistic is going through the roof.  Then, I got to my lessons, where I was waiting outside for the wrong class, I had switched the times of the two and forgotten, much to my chagrin. So I got a shortened lesson on both of them, and did horribly on both of them. But somehow, not in an entirely terrible mood. It was, environmentally, a bad day. My skin jacket, affected, the box called soul, not. A wonderful day, in that respect.  I know tomorrow will be better, the days after always are. That was one out of the past four. And I always get one out of every week as a "bad day", at least one. Plus, I've been wishing on the clock for the past four days at 11:11 for good luck, and although it never does anything, I can always run into some unsuspectingly good luck and attribute it to this clock wishing.  And no philosophic posts tonight, at least for now.  I  know  you're all  so  depressed.

      To me, it's just another cycle of life, and whatever you  can  draw from it, you should. If you feel to get close to everyone, then by all means do. That will be a hellacious life, and I can already tell you that some will take it the wrong way, but if you think that is the answer to this short life cycle, then by all means take it.  What do you want to do with your life? If your grandfather's death is telling you this, then there actually must be something there that you're thinking about? A major change? A few smaller ones? I have no idea. The fact is, and for all of what you may draw from this scenario, that you need to live for yourself, and whatever you feel you need to get out of this, do, because, thankfully, it doesn't happen all the time.  But when it does, there's always a lesson to be learned.

      Ok, that last post was a little precursor to this one, which you wanted me to write yesterday...I ran out of time this morning.  This is about Leigh Anne, and perhaps I put it off because she didn't like it but it's time to reminisce. I've been thinking about this post all morning, the little nuances I was going to put in it.  My cousin Seth described his last relationship with his girlfriend Brooke, and in many ways it was like mine, in many ways it has ended in the same way. "Do you love me?", and he would cynically reply at the end, "More and more everyday..." and then look up at me as he hung up, roll his eyes, and try to suffocate himself with his own pillow. Somehow, I was the same at the end, perhaps not with the same words, but in the way I started to feel as she broke more towards my friends than me, as Brooke did.  This morning I was putting off waking up, staring at that same cloud strewn sky as the past three days, and suddenly I was intensely bemused, as I was thinking about our amazing but brief relationship that ended in such disaster, and all because of me, this time. But I laughed...laughed for all the good times, for horses that resembled amoeba, for random thoughts, for finding pieces of ourselves in each other that we had never thought we would see, to be more amazed by each other every day, and for all of that to end, for all the dreams and promises to die nearly overnight. I laughed because, after all, I'm just a litte human in the end, and losing this girl, as completely apart from the rest of the world as she is, these losses, this breaking of spirits happens all the time, and as it was caused by me this time, why have I to complain?   But I still remember them all fondly...perhaps a little too fondly, as they creep between my thought and make themselves apparent every once in a while in some process of life. Like doing geometry, for some reason that incubates these thoughts, or for sitting alone, which I have a lot of time to do these days, it helps these thought to permeate the shallower reaches of my ever-going mind.  It feels like it's not over, and I guess in some ways it still isn't, it takes time for everyone to get over these things. The only problem with me, is, I don't think that my thoughts are going to let me go on this one, for a long time. I really don't know what to do but to just let things happen, and if it really does end in us apart, then so long to yesterday.  And strangely, these bittersweet memories permeate again.  Oh, how I miss her already.

      josh do you think that my grandfather's death means something?  Like maybe i should be motivated to get out and do something with my life before it's to late.  Or maybe it means I shouldn't take things or people, rather, for granted.  should i try to get close to everyone i know, call all the time, set aside time to spend with everyone?  Maybe it means that we should all just take care of our selves.  Whatever it means, it could become a revelation for me.

      Another strange morning.  It's time to do something I've been putting off, for Brittany's sake, as she has been advocating me to write something like this, despite my best intentions, as much as I try to resist it, I think the time for it has come. I think I think I think. In fact, that's all I do, which is why I make such amazingly elongated posts.

      Tidings, all, and a Bon Mardi Gras, tout le monde.  Today was a great day, and it was all because of outside. The climate was simply stupefying, and it cleared up a lot of accumulated woe over the past few days. And it looks like a light rain tonight which should be nice, as long as it clears up by tomorrow.  And, I should be audioblogging starting this Sunday, if all goes to plan. I get my ten dollars allowance, nine of that goes to BLog and I get twelve calls a month at three dollars a month for three months. So I'll be set for a while. Then, with the next three weeks' allowance, I'm saving to buy Jerry's new album,  Degradation Trip Volumes One and Two , which features all of the  Degradation Trip  songs and eight new ones, including  Hurts Don't It? ,  Sidhartha ,  Pig Charmer , which is about Layne, whose deathday is coming up with Kirt Cobain's this April 5th, and others. It promises to be a great album, and I can hardly wait a month to get it.  To the thing I found fascinating tonight:  I was taking a bath just for the sake of soaking. I was ultimately tired and looking for something relaxing to do to ease my caffeine-induced body, and I happened to come upon the idea of taking a bath. It's been a while, but in I went, turning the water to a flinching degree of heat. I slipped in a sat for a while, then became bored and got out. Then I took the towel to myself.  The towel, that was the thing.  This was a new towel...at least, new to the upstairs shower. The main one is a thick, blue monstrosity, reeking of long-washed out cat urine as they had the gumption to find the towel fallen in the tub and somehow took it as their perogative to piss upon it. Past the ammonitic smell, it is also quite cumbersome and takes quite a long time to dry, so naturally every time it is used, the new towelee takes a goodly amount of time in getting dry, as the towel is already soaking. So, what a surprise to find this towel, one stictched by my parental step-grandmother for my mother ages ago, with half the personalization stitches ripped out by my mother for some reason or another ("MA", it reads).  But I took the towel about me, at first not noticing the difference, and then inhaling slightly...no cat piss. It was an oddity, but I chanced a downward look and found that all-too-familiar half-gone stitch of "MARY".   Another whiff smelled of cologne...what is this,  Grey Flannel ?  That Man ? It was my dad's old cologne.   It reminded me of warm summer days where five year old boys would wake up and waste that same day in front of a Nintendo-stricken TV, but nonetheless make the entire day worth it, because he was busy having too much fun to notice the outside. And all the while, his father next to him, only a few feet away, sitting leisurely in a creaking office chair with sunlight illuminating his face from below, pouring in through three windows in the room, and each was open, giving off a scent of tree and grass and sun and wind and sky, and his father was languidly staring at a computer screen, sometimes looking interesting, sometimes laughing at some joke of his son's, or one of his rantings about losing his Nintendo game. Then the evenings came, and the boy would go outside and the summer was suddenly around him everywhere he walked, and it was pure heaven to run in that slighty humidified but sweet air. It was summer, he was young, and the world was something else every single time.  And then, I turned the towel and I smelled the sea.  Sea salt, sand, it was Florida, and the same boy, although he was older now, his face a little bolder, his frame a little taller, and he was laughing with his cousin and sister as he ran into the waves, choking on rushing salt water and still wide-mouthedly howling with mirth. It was sunset, and here the boy found what he thought was love for the first time with a girl he had met there, and they drew hearts in the sand all the way down the beach. Eventually, the girl would leave and, in a trail of hearts, the boy was applauded by all on the quieting beach, cheering and wooping, clapping and general appreciation at the sight of young love, a sign that the whole world was just fine. He would never see the girl again for the rest of his time there, and three years later, when he saw her again, she remembered him with a shy smile and restrained glances, saying little and blushing much, staying near him but keeping her distance, and this time there was only one heart in the sand, hers, a farewell present to the boy, who, knowing this time, would never glimpse the face again.  And as the boy types he cannot remember her face but he can remember that day all too well, the day he figured out that there was something to the idea of love, something fascinating, that while it ends one day, while it is there, it is magic, forbidden and wonderful magic, the sort that actually  does  inspire men to jump cliffs and float all the way down, to run fire, skip sea, dance sky, slide earth, it moves him to hysteria, and in it he is content, and all around him are somehow not illed by this flagrant show of emotion, but somehow wryly enriched at seeing it; there is love, so powerful a force, so fleeting, but yet it strikes with the fury of colliding worlds and the quickness of cobras made of lightning.   What a strange fate to have had a towel and remember the two best times in my entire life.  It was warm, then.

      It was another of those mornings.  I kind of woke up and didn't, I was in "between times", the scattered, minus-human zone between sleeping and wakeness for a long while, floating in sleep and anti-substance, for what seemed like hours. In the morning I was blinking sleep and rubbing watering eyes, and for some reason knew that I had not slept at all last night, for whatever primal human reason I have not stumbled upon. I did not, and in front of this computer I feel as a mouse feigning a bit too much before the wheels of a dump truck.  Another little tap of caffeine at break this morning. It's a shame I have all these excess Cokes, they're giving me an excuse to drink them at any time...which reminds me why I didn't sleep last night. They were  calling  me with such cute, pert, uppity voices, how could I resist?  I'm trying to stave estranged looks from Brittany at my left, who is busy reading backlogs from Saturday (the Invincible one, the Charlie Brown one first, and pretty soon she'll reach the Hope and Day posts).  All for now.

      Well, that settles it. Look at the little icon above, did you click on it? Wasn't that great?  It's only three dollars a month, and seeing as how I make ten a week, I'm going to get it. Quite possibly one of the most ingenuitive designs ever: you call a preset number and it asks you a few questions, and after this, a little beep and some recording time, and your voice is BLog-bound.   The transcript of the above-call:  Hello antiphilanthrophists, this is Josh, I was just, uh, trying out the cool little doohickey because it's free and...hey, whatever and...ha hum...don't really know what to say, but this is me to all the people that don't know me and all the people that do: stay cool. Bye bye everybody.    Ok, now off to the present. A shaking day ended in a fine-enough manner. As I had expected, I was quite smacked about the face by Brittany for being a "fucking idiot", and I agreed with her every propulsion of hand and muscle. Overall, however, the bus ride was much more enlightening than the past few weeks of cloudy commune, and seeing the sun and smelling a semblace of spring was uplifting to me. I felt as if I lost another shroud of impertinence while waiting  on that ride.  Hope Brittany has something to tell me tomorrow.

      Sorrow and joy, I am both and torn, as well.  I have sorrow today. Sorrow, sorrow, I feel its soft and unbreakable chain tugging a relentless row about my frame once again, and this time Lady Sadness is unceasing, for I have created something that, I think, cannot be undone by any likes which I may ever posess, no matter what anyone says. What has happened, has happened. My sadness is incessant.  I have joy today. Most prominent in my mind: coming into this class from a brutally short break, sitting down extremely tired but nonetheless feeling a tingling of caffeine from an early morning fix, and with much joy, and much to my  extreme  shock, tells me I won the cover design contest for the school play, and most of the innards of the program. Considering the effort I put into this...my joy at confundling the masses with the greatest fonts ever, "Rage Italic" and "Blackadder ATI (or something to that extent)", comes to no end.  And I am with joy because of the sun...  This morning I woke to voices. It was early, they were in my ear, voices, voices, it was Vietnamese, and I couldn't understand any of it, and suddenly the phone clicked as I had expected, as it does every morning prior, and I happened to see the sky above my pillow-covered head...  (what is that, light?)  I stared at it uncomprehendingly for a minute, and just as suddenly drifted into a fiftul doze littered with haunted thoughts of that very night, the one that stimulated my sorrow. But again, voices (I hung up the phone, it's away from me), voices traversing the hall and through my (opened?) door, I heard my sister and mother talking at about 5:30 and could not help but sit and wonder at it all, what was wrong with this day, besides the fact that life may have permanently changed overnight? I looked  outside , I found the answer.  There, the sky was a light and billowing pastel canvas, the blue was a drape of cyan silk about the fleeting cloud-blotched horizon. And there was light, a light that I hadn't seen in days and days, knowing somehow that it will never come back, and knowing otherwise all the same. I could not yet see it, but I felt it, and I felt as if something was a-right with the world again, the gray days of February gone forever, into a spring with light, not the dull gray curtain that ne'er ceased to infect my soul with it bitter dirge of melancholy playing an incessant chord on my mind.   And in spite of everything that had happened last night and before that, for the greatness of the weekend, in which many things were found and resolved in myself, I hung my head and shook it back and forth, half joy and sorrow, throwing my burning tears about the window and the ceil with ragged gasps and sobs, only quiet enough so as to be heard by no one but me, I cried and rocked myself with my arms locked on the window ceil and felt as if I had one wing broken and one wing above all wings, and I sat, waiting to decide whether to risk flying or stay grounded forever. I cried and rocked myself back and forth, the sway a light breeze against my muscles, all taut and burning with long-surpressed anguish and despair, I cried and rocked myself and told myself that many things had been resolved, and that nothing is ever quite over, so long as one does not forget, I cried and rocked myself and made a vow with myself that I would never forget what had happened here with anyone, that I had learned somethings so bizarre and useful, and at such a price, oh what a price I have paid, and slowly dying I surrendered my poisoned soul as it fades to gray...does it sound familiar? No wonder now, why I wrote it, I felt as if there some venom inhibiting my ability to love and live, and suddenly I have found it, it was myself and my discontentment with imperfection...even in this discontent is complete imperfection, it is impossible to strive for perfect in this world. If it ends, it cannot be perfect enough.   I gasped a last time, I swallowed the rest of whatever wanted to inhibit my acting as a composed human, rubbed dry my eyes and walked out the door to the shower, thinking I would never reach such a low again, thinking that I can do better with myself, thinking that I will take control with the advent of last night, somehow, with or without what I had before I began this mad cycle of ups and downs in life. I turned on the water and inhaled the scents of a new morning and sighed long, perhaps theatrically, taking my time and letting the heat entrance me and fascinate my reddening skin, I inhaled the steam and the soap and the dew and the dawn.  And another day began.

      An ineffible hunger.  I didn't eat today, and when I began as such, it was as if I was a starved prisoner of war for some years, I could not be filled to capacity. Later, of course, my stomach will discourse upon that matter, but as for now, my appetite is only more whetted with each passing bite.  Today is March the second, and outside lurks a cold, dark abyssia, grinning its orai grin on a mass of powerless souls, such a puissant species, with so little power nonetheless. We are devoured by our insolence, have we no idea that this bitter and unending frost is of our creation? Two-hundred years ago, at this very spot, did the frostbitten winter months ever last this long? Nay, this cold is birthed by the womb of industrialization, a sadly necessary function of the new age of man, the man that does not think and has his machines think for him, the man that has forsaken love and home for his love of the world, to the embrace of nothingness, to that which shall never transcend the bonds of time, he gives himself to wasted causes, to countries, he serves the greater good, which is, of course, no good at all, because it is an idea, because society and government are ideas, and as such are powerless to the quaking gods of existence and time, of space and energy, the creations of man are illusion, and we are dust and shadows.  It is a strange fate to have hold of such power and to be so powerless, in the end. What is after death? Judgment? And what, then, happened to your worldly concerns? Is it not, that they vanished in a puff of smoke? Is that not the glory of death, the end of life, the end of the painful and trying realm of mortality?  The darkness of these endless nights with their lopsided, hellish grins are beginning to consume all of us by the night, as during the day the clouds enveloped not only sky but spirit, it saw so many upon the verge of personal destruction, it saw us a glum and powerless race, a mighty fire cut short in a great rain, only the rain took substance, and still the fire died.   And all of this, just a reflection of the morosity I have seen around me, the sorrow self-imposed by the seasons that have left us to be eaten by carrion death and dismay. I watch it and see the sins of the fathers and mothers imposed on their young, simply by the fact that sin is let to exist in the world, and there is no greater pain than watching that which is ourselves to writhe in torments so much greater than ours. The sins take such wonderful guises and times to take us, but they have. Sin, the black blooded vein that flows staight down our family trees and branches into all of us. For this to go on much longer, as I have seen it.  God help us all.

      This is an account of my last night, as told by myself, who would be the greatest source of knowledge on such a subject:  The car ride home was a four year old talking to his mother. My chatter was incessant, the fever of "hurdle-jumping", finally facing a long awaited day of judgment, still burning in my head. On and on about our performance, what we had done, what was truly brilliant, what I had done, every aspect of our victory, our miraculous performance; strangely nothing of the Instant Challenge past "it was impossible but we made it", thus securing my vow of secrecy.  And the ride ran on for what seemed like not long enough, there was still far more to tell about, a thousand thousand wonders not yet embarked upon rolling about my tongue, and I langoured to spit them all out and watch them dance about and to let everyone share my joy at felling the giant. However, considering that I would be zoned for Centennial had I not been cheating the Board, as I will be until the end of this year when they change the state to open-zoning, the ride was  ultimately  abrupt. A few miles straight down the road and I was home, still talking about "going to state" or "yeah, well the 'TT' on my back means...". I unlocked the door and burst inside, positively throwing myself at my two dogs anxiously awaiting their mother, and were not in the least disappointed at this surprising spasm of attention. After a minute of this, and calming mine and my mother's laughter, I stood up and went to the computer and typed several posts of our victory on the various BLogs to which I am subscribed that were appropriate as for such.   And then it all went down. The facade of energy and motivation for the day, the quick mind, the supple wit, the burning spirit, the mind intuned to one goal, all sank back into the dark places of my mentality and I was a common, fifteen-year-old boy again. Caffeine became a dull and worthless substance, I had just finished a Coke, and even after this and the one before I succumbed to sleep, I was  tired . I also gained a massive hunger, as the adrenaline faded into weariness and human need, as the "Id" took over, and I devoured some leftovers in the fridge, possibly faster than I have ever eaten, even in down times after Taekwondo tournaments when I was younger, and once I had believed that those were the most nerve-wracking feats I had ever undertaken.  I talked to my mother for a while as the both of us watched TV, a absolutely lurid show about mortuary school on Discovery or TLC, and remembered a song that I had not quite forgotten that morning, one which stuck in my head as I woke, one that abbated the primal urges to howl in fear and aprrehension, as a caged dog in a place of foul scents. I remembered that I had been singing what I knew of that song to myself and it made me stronger, somehow, a great wall against the deluge of Noah and his ark.   " I remember you...do you remember me too?...'Cuz I would give everything that I own, give you the skin and this flesh and these bones, the sun, the moon, the earth and sky, I never even stopped to wonder why... "  And I had a great desire to find that song and the words and learn it and play it and sing it to myself, because for just a few hours, the song had  inspired  me to do great things, and not even in physical manifest, but things inside myself that surprised even me. Things that made me sit and the awards ceremony last night and wonder, " How? This isn't like me ."  It took two hours, because the lyrics are a bit trite, and the internet is full of scamming fools and false promises and broken things long forgotten. When I did find it I nearly shouted, in fact I believe I did. The song is, of course, called  Everything , and the artist, which I somehow knew as I typed the words into the last search box of the night, is Lit. I ran up the stairs and sang to the chordings (which were simple enough for me to pick out in a literal fifteen seconds) until my fretboard fingers began to redden with blood. I put the guitar down and set to reading. Then the world rocked me a hazy blow. I felt the dark circles under my eyes and the emptied will, and, nearly throwing the book down, I slept.   Awake . A small needle pushed its way into my arm. I sprang into wakeness in an instant at my attacker, and again the primal survival urge kicked it, the want to be not eaten in sleep. But still, my vision swam with shadows of juxtaposing dark with dark, and the world was a stream of Stygian night, a devil's soul blackness. And then a sandpaper upon my cheek, now my lips,  scratch, scratch  it said. I knew what it was, then, I knew, but I had to turn on the light anyway, to sate my curiosity.  Camille sat on my chest with all claws bared, especially happy to have finally received recognition for her prescence. She flitted happily around for a while, and I was annoyed to be forced to content my new visitor, but I was nevertheless, forced. Cats have a strange way of demanding your attention and getting it, no matter what they do. But sleep in us all is stronger than the hand of Prime Movers Unmoved, and darkness overcame once again. This scene repeated itself multitudinously during the starlight hours, but eventually I shrugged her off to the point that her cat lusts of "mememe" died within her, and she curled upon the bed and slept.  I woke this morning to ragged thoughts of " If only... "...   If only I hadn't stopped Rosie from giving me the ring and went on with the skit. Better that than the alternative...which we got...   They died in my head pretty quickly. I felt like a great iron box had fallen on me from a thousand foot tower. I sat inert for a while, and after an hour I had the gumption to sit up and read for a time. I turned the page, the pain in my head subsided, I turned the page, my blurred thoughts refocused, I turned the page, I remembered the triumph over misgiving from the day before, and I was moved to grin, albeit wolfishly, or so I thought to myself. And again and again, a turn, a new sensation, until I was assaulted with the full of my humanity and stood, taking a shaky step away from the bed to the window, awed at the sunstruck horizon, the sun that had not passed my eyes for two weeks.  Later on I would be typing an earlier part of this post and looking outside. There, I saw the ground turn from it's now-common gray shade to illuminated beige and green, crab grass and the sweet, common blades that decorated the scattered pate of the planet, and I rose as if by magic toward the door, I was drifting outside, hoping that the sun would last for just another second, I saw the clouds assaulting her again, threatening to shroud that wonderful lantern of day. I threw the door open and stepped outside.  It was a world of brightness and wonder. Wonder, I wondered at the blurred sun piercing a thin veil of clouds and I was blinded, but I was rejoicing in the coming of the sun, a touch of this galaxy's organic lifeforce once again, the monkey-urges satisfied for a time, and despite the sordid drops of rain, small and wide-spread, smiting my shoulders sporadically, muffled, a  pop , and upon my still-duct-taped shoes,  plick, plick , the invisible droplets heeding the call of their master, the veiled sky, to attack the hopes of humanity, the faintest and somehow most important need, to see the sun, to see that their hope had not yet died and that the sun had not yet quit a dying age of humanity. I saw it and felt it, and somehow a part of me long dead sprang into being, as, I think, it did to us all.  It was hope.

      I woke up with my hair in my face, and I was no one.  It was a strange set of events that had led me to this point. Sweating, I realized I was being suffocated and pulled hard my oppressor from my person. Of course, the pillow flew away with no difficulty and I sat assessing my place.  The first thing that happened was that I looked at the clock, which read 11:07. The first thing I had done was try to remember who I was, and with some difficulty, did so. Thereafter, I tried to assess the day of the week, as a dull ache called  school  troubled me to keep my wits about me even as I drifted into slumber again. Sleep never came, which is why I am here.   Next I walked to the phone. I remembered that Kenzie had said they would call me from the mall when they got there. Of course, I walked to the phone (albeit shakily) and picked it up, thumbing the caller ID button.    No calls since six?  What time had I fallen asleep? The call on the phone was one I had answered before I had gone to my room and fallen asleep. I was gripped with some animal panic instantly because I had remembered something important: it was a Friday, at 11 o'clock, and here I am at my mother's house, with my father downstairs, presumably. I opened the door and looked out. The hall was black; strange, as Katie almost never fails to leave a light on. But the air was black as pitch, and I went back to my bed to sort out what had just happened. More than anything else, I was plagued by the dreams.  They have come back, dreams of unnatural disorder that haunts me, even in its smallest capacity, and each time I wake and lose another piece of myself. I forget my current purpose, I forget my name, I forget the last person I talked to, or what has happened in the past year, I forget  all  of it. Slowly it floods back, but the silent emperor of the dream stays enthroned, a spike in my mind. The dream sat as I remembered the details of the moment, grinning its orai grin, harvesting my soul.  I went downstairs, pausing at the top, and despite almost utter deafness to acute sounds, I first heard the muffled pitch of my father's voice, or at least thought I did. For a second, I waited for some confirmation, and seconds later, my mother answered him. But where were they? I trumbled down the stairs and was greeted by a dark living room. Even the computer, which is normally always sparked with life, lay still. I heard their voices again and moved toward it. But what is  this , their voices coming from the same darkened room? As if it wasn't enough that my mind was doing a tapdance on my soul, something else unnatural, my divorced parents in the same room, sleeping...and god forbid... together ?  I pushed open the door slightly and tried my powers of speech, which was successful but slow nonetheless, with fatigue and forgetfulness. My dad slept on a feather matress on the floor in my mother's room, and they were tiredly conversing about us not getting enough sleep on the weekdays. I inquired as to why we were still here, my dad justified this by saying I was sleeping and he didn't want to wake me.   But all the lights were on in my room, dad , I had wanted to say, they were, and the primal urges told me this was out of place. Most of the time, as I sleep before I am supposed, I awake and the lights are off. In fact nearly always. It was interesting that they had left both of them on.   I walked to the kitchen and was gripped by hunger, I ate some peanuts and a glass of Wyler's awesome raspberry stuff that is no longer in production, and sat in front of the computer now to inform all of you that, yes, and truly:  I am going completely mad.

      Self-help books.  I never thought I would read one. And here I am doing as such. The book is called  Rapid Relief from Emotional Distress , and I must say, this book is golden. I would suggest this to anyone, even those not under any mental duress: their technique in making you feel better is almost instantly effective. I've only read about thirty pages and I already feel so much different about everything. It works on you all the time, as well. For instance, I took a nap today after reading a bit of the book, and when I woke up, I had forgotten that anything was ever wrong. It was as if all the emotional disquietude I've been through in the past few months just evaporated.  This book has taught me an important concept: you are both directly and indirectly responsible for everything that you feel, and that you must accept reality before  anything  else. Experience the emotion, remember it, let it go. It sounds like a lot of psychological horseshit, I know, but I know they can't be wrong. How is this? They tell stories in there about failed relationships and insecurities, and guess whose they described? To a tee, my entire relationship problem in three pages, why I feel the way I do, how I react to it, what I should do against it.  The main problem I have, and the thing that it described that made me believe it, was its illustration of the want of the depressed subject to want others to change, or to want themselves to change, or their situation. Whatever the case, they want changes which they cannot have, and thus are more depressed against it. It was then they went into accepting reality and such as being the first step, and then making choices and acting on them, creating a vision of a goal and then making the necessary steps to get there. And if you ever get depressed again, they have a ton of thing to do to get yourself out of it and back on track.  I can't believe I could ever even consider the subject material within as relevant, ever. I would usually think of it as brain discoloring shrink jargon, but for some reason, this book makes things so easy to understand. And since I have about three people in line to read it already, you can tell how much I've been talking about it elsewhere.   Strangely, the best book I've read in years.

      I found, quite possibly, one of the best songs I've heard in a long time this weekend.  Of course, with my much overexaggerated announcement do you all know I got the album  A Dead Poem  this weekend, and with it came a sampler CD of the best black metal acts in Europe, one of which came from...right...one of those Baltic states, and one of the acts is called Sentenced, the song,  Shadegrown . It sounds just like the better parts of Metallica, Black Album-era, and even though I can't understand what he's saying, and no, it's not like Rotting Christ garbled, it's  just  like Metallica, and I mean down to the vocals, the lyrics are simply catchy. It's enough by this one song to make me by the album. And believe me, considering how much I like Rotting Christ, I was  ultimately  unimpressed by the first song of theirs I heard,  A Dead Poem .  As for other news, I'm getting the AudioBLogger in a few days. Here's the plan: those posts are going to be geared toward certain topics, and they're only going to be on the weekend, thrice a weekend, since those are the times I have no Internet, and they all have titles for the next three months, such as the first one,  Hello/The Names , which is the introduction to the audbloggings and discussing some of the names in here, and yes, I already have all of these written out. The whole catch is, only two minutes to each post. Which means I have to be  quick  in divulging the secrets of life, or harder, my life in general. The second posts is  The Dreams , talking about having a thousand dreams lately, about the most random things.  That shall be about soon.  Until then, keep it bitter, so to speak.

      Hehehhe.  Hahahahahhahahahahahahhahaha.  HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA.  Guess who didn't make the talent show? Yes, we found out as a group this morning. It's not so bad though; the most priceless judge's comment: "The lyrics were too dark for the talent show." They like us well enough, just not enough to take us. We were also boring, or so it was said, and too loud. It makes me weep with wonderous joy, knowing another few have been infected with the poison of loud music; not to addict them to such music, just to exert life from their ears.  So now I've to wait for the fundraiser for Alex's temple, and for Caf Express to open again in May. That means we can fill the long hours by figuring out the rest of our songs and putting them to life.  What a boring, boring wait.

      I  did  get  A Dead Poem  today.  And now the talent show tryouts post-slaughter report.  1 busted kick drum, which Kcin happened to kick through right before tryouts; we remedied this by giving him ours for lend. 2 bottles of PowerAde, given by a faulty machine after inserting one dollar into the machine, pressing the button for a water, and getting two PowerAdes 3 times  My Solution  was rehearsed before we actually went on 4 hours we waited to perform after our scheduled time; of twenty-seven acts, we were last 5 acts to go before I realized "hey, I've got to sing in front of these people", and started getting scared Ok, enough of this hard "by numbers" diatribe... 3 sets of strings bought in preparation for the talent show 1000: the number of times I wanted to punch in the face of the band before us, for being a dickhead 10000: the number of keys Rosie hit by the end of her piece 100000: the magnitude of my current headache 4 squares of toilet paper 10 ear plugs made from this toilet paper 1 long strand of TP that got stuck to my foot while leaving the stall moments before we were to go on 30 minutes behind schedule we were (of course, from the accumulated time, you can see that this wasn't such a bad thing) 3: current number of groupies, after the two in the hall talking about us jamming on Rotting Christ's  Sorrowful Farewell , they are officially groupies, and Rosie. And probly Kenzie and all of her friends and Leigh Anne and Lily. So more, althought they aren't signed groupies yet 96+: the number of decibles over I was the first two times we played  My Solution , which Tyler's dad helped us clean up 96-: the level of the mic, that was helpful 7: the number of extraneous songs we played, including  Sorrowful Farewell ,  Higher ,  Bad Religion , and  Little Rhyme  99999: the number of steps I took during the course of the evening 1: the number of times I expelled breath during the course of the evening 1/2: the number of times my heart has chanced a beat since the beginning of the evening 1 pair of shades lost to the ISS room 2 bottles of PowerAde fully consumed by the band -99999 as the efficiency of my muscles 1 wreck almost had on the way home by an asshole cutting in for a left turn as I was going straight, he going to a McDonald's, that lousy fucker One whole as the amount of Biology report I've yet to do 0 as my motivation for this and any other forms of work But 999999999999999999999999 for energy prior to this point, as I was in a combat fervor  It was really cool walking down the silent halls of BHS jumping to touch the low ceilings, laughing and doing whatever the hell we felt like. Mostly, we made sure we had fun before we went on: we watched a few acts, we talked about stuff, we made fun of the other bands, we practiced, we watched Rosie tinker upon the piano, we watched Michael Nixon and Chip Adcock playing an acoustic version of  In The End  by Linkin Park, we scrambled to get set up, we got killer headaches and lost half our hearing, but overall it was probably one of the greatest nights I've had since the DI meeting. And now the long wait until tomorrow, wherefore we see who gets cut...  God help us. Good luck to Rosie and Nick and his band.  And good luck to us too.

      Here's some sad news:  I'm leaving for Florida tomorrow and it's cloudy out there, and those clouds are probably going to chase us Charlie Brown-style to Florida, whereafter we will be rained with The Second Biblical Flood and never allow'd by nature to hit the beach. And it will really screw with my plans too, considering they consist of: wake up, take a shower, jump off the balcony and onto the beach for twenty or so hours, go back inside, sleep, start it all over again. For the next  week , by god, I  love  Florida; I should ask my mom to move down here to some obscure beach town, since she's always threatening to go to some secluded town in the midst of nowhere. Why not have a beach while we're at it?  Sorry for the "beach bum fever" the past few days, just incredibly excited to be going somewhere nice for spring. If I recall last year was spent in my dad's house, where I enjoyed an exciting week of rain and surfing the Internet. On the sunny days I was given the perogative to sit outside and read all day. It  has  occurred to me that there is no difference between that and this year's schedule; it's just that this year has a big fucking blue expanse of water stuck in the middle there.   Bon vacances to all you Antiphilanthropists, and a big wet sob to those in MLK and Warton having to go back while I langour in an endless bask for the next week, to all of Davidson for that matter.  .rtaL

      French...  Well it wasn't a total waste of time. Today I cooked "Quiche Lorraine" for Food Day tomorrow in sixth period. It turned out pretty good sans a few grevious errors; forgetting to put ingredience in the batter, getting absolutely devastated by a giant greasy blast of bacon and dropping the fork in the batter, forgetting the method with which to beat eggs: I fry mine most of the time, no violence involved. Then the bacon got a little done, but somehow that was "ok" according to my mom. Cheese, everywhere. Onions, everywhere: by the time I was done chopping them my eyes were watering terribly, and while putting them in the measuring cup, I missed entirely in some cases. The salt...I put a "dash" as I thought it had said; upon further inspection, the guide said "3/4 teaspoon". Great, I already applied the dash. And what worse, no three-fourths teaspoons. So I whipped out the good old third grade math and put those 1/2s and 1/4s together. It's baking now; I think it turned out pretty darned good.  As for me, I am tired. I went shopping. It was  hell . Actually, it wasn't that bad. I got a sleeveless shirt that is extremely comfortable, and it goes with all these shorts I bought (try, three pairs of those evil suckers). Plus this quiche, wearing me out, and I have about three years of European History to catch up on...and I don't mean in the book either, I have about twenty there.   I also did dissections in biology today, to a gigantic earthworm. In reality, it was about five and a half inches long, and made gross noises and Steven and I razor-bladed it and pinned down the sides. After the fact, we played with the dissect corpse a bit, and found that we had burst the seminal receptacles, where sperm is stored, and it covered the heart of the thing. We asked the teacher what the hell was wrong with our worm, is it heartless? No, she said, it's got jizz all over it. I was able to clear some of it away with my probe and we prodded at the arches a little bit. Then we prodded the gizzard, which is muscular and filled with sand, and it's really fun to poke. Steven tried to cut it open but without much success. Another kid came over and started dropping parts of the worm on our dissection plate: first, the skin on the posterior end, then, the entire intestine, then, a semen-covered ganglia, or brain. Thereafter we had fun with the lower intestine and anus, but I won't go in to that. As if I should have given all the detail I've already given. But it was interesting, Rosie was right. I won't have such misgivings tearing that little piggy fetus to bits. Except for the bones, gross.  Wow, from food to juicy animal corpses, aren't I a toastmaster?   And in other news, leaving for Florida the day after tomorrow! I'm stoked. Sunny days chasing the clouds away...   Oscar the Grouch is the greatest character on that show, by the way.

      Dreams again.  This time the dreams are about my mother dying and my being...almost apathetic. I couldn't cry, and no one could believe it, but all went on through the day knowing that my mother was dead. Even as my mother pulled up to take me "somewhere", she was dead.  "Mom, you're dead." "I know. Get in."  She drove me to a great house, and it was there that this great, black monster, the apex of my fears, began to chant out the very thing that has haunted me since the dreams began, a song of defeat, it tells me in the simplest of terms what I fear the most, and unfortunately for me, the simplicity strikes me at some odd level and I am moved by it, stricken by it.  I don't know why but I cannot say much about this dream. At the time I was under the influence of an antihistamine, that wonderful pink pill called Claritin, and I expected no dreams; however, this dream was one of the most clear I have had since they began. At first I woke and truly thought my mother was dead, that is until she opened the door, and I remembered that dead people don't wake you up when you sleep past your alarm, rather: she would probably eat me alive.   But something in my mind took the great ideas for the oration I had planned for this BLog and most of the minute details of the dream and tossed them to abyssia, where I have forgotten all that was important that I should have said here.  Look outside, the sun is gone again.  Another long gray and my soul is suffused with the black'd rain.

      Two is a band enough.  And honestly, go back as far as you can and look how many times I've talked about Stranglebox in here. I wanted to bring it up just to say that I did. I have a lot of pride in the fact that we're able to do what we have already.  What else is there to talk about in here, unless something happens? And since the days are getting slower, that flow of interesting stuff is slowing down to a hault.  Or perhaps I just don't want to talk about certain things.

      Did I tell everyone about my band's BLog? It's at  urlLink stranglebox.blogspot.com . I thought I would just point you in that direction, as I'm going to make this a quick post about said band.   Bitter , or my band's album, as some of you know, has undergone massive changes since the  urlLink TinHaven  BLog. There's two musical pieces now, one purely acoustic ( Goodbye My Friend ) and the other a full-set piece with accompanying piano ( The Color Black ).  These Chains  has been scrapped in favour of a new song  Sweetly Forgotten , which was more complete from its conception than  Chains . Also, the song  Deadgone  has been scrapped in favour of a song meant to go on the next one, and which has also been written since seventh grade,  Rage . It was strange using this song, since back then it was only a vision, I was expecting the lady at the Country Music Hall of Fame to take the lyrics and bend them to music, and suddenly it's a reality, in fact,  my  reality.  So that is the update, despite your unconcern :).   And briefly, as for yesterday, it was like slipping through a dream somehow. Time marched on, we had fun at the mall, sans de movie, and Zoe didn't show after some poor planning. But after it was over, everyone was taken home and the punishments were passed out for being so late, I was left sitting in the passenger seat of a car with my mother driving for what seemed like hours, listening to the song  Full Colour Is The Night  and lapsing into sleep, waking to  Ten Miles High , falling back asleep, waking to  Between Times  and sitting up, turning off the blasting CD player. I asked my mom if I had been snoring, because I had the vaguest impression that I had, and she said otherwise.  As I came home I went to my room, hit the pillow, and knew no more.

      Damned be this school.  Here this morning they build us up by telling us we're going to see the play during school; that got shot down as the announcements came on, telling us  au contraire  straight off. That wasn't very nice. It was probably some idiot kid's rumor though. "Nothing gold can last," so is said, and honestly, it's not as if it really matters. Sans de school is always nice, but if we have to put up with it, it's no big deal, considering this is the home stretch before spring break. And that will be  wonderful . And it will also be  one-thousand years . Massive crying on my part.  Still didn't go shopping. Surprise! Why would I? I had a ton to do this week. Going to my dad's isn't typically a great feat, however, and considering this was the last week I'll have the chance for the next three weeks or so, his house had to take the perogative. Although we locked horns this weekend over pointless matters, of which I came out the better, I'm afraid. It feels pretty lame winning a fight that nets you nothing, so I've found.  But it was a great weekend, and a great week. I didn't go to school Wednesday, I stayed the night at my mom's Friday and ended up waking in a stupor, I went to my dad's and basically ran around outside for the balance of the weekend, I kicked  ASS  at Unreal Tournament 2003. And then last night I wanted to crush some cans outside, just to have something to do, and the resident rug mounkeys, also known as my neighbors under the age of twelve who talk of adult matters (for instance, the words "sex" or "condom") with guarded words and sly grins, came over and helped out, whereafter they tried wrestling me to the ground and I  defeated  them utterly. It was a rout and a half. It was also yesterday that I listened to a CD in its entirety without stopping once. Even as the phone rang, and knowing it was for my sister, I left the room and closed the door, handled the call as fast as I possibly could, jumped back into the room and sprang onto my place on the bed, the side I never sit on, where I have found the wind blows the most. Tapping my foot to such songs as  Ten Miles High ,  Full Colour Is The Night ,  Nighttime Birds ,  The Millenium King ,  Shadegrown , yes, all those satanistic, wonderful and enlightening bands.   And today, going to a movie avec Lily and Zoe, the latter of whom I have never met, so woohoo! It actually doesn't bother me as to what we see, it's just nice to get out and do something. Ok, so it blows my allowance to hell, so no AudBLogging or CDs for me, but I suppose this is what my allowance was supposed to go towards anyway. In case Lily is reading this:   AFTER   2:30, or I won't get the call / I'll get screwed over by my teachers, and  that  won't happen since I put it on "Silent". So worst case is I miss it by three seconds and call you back thereafter. Talk to you then.  Thou art blind, be the law art thou as pride.

      Good day all. And a good day it is.  Ok, so not that good. From sleeping with the window open the other day, I have found that my immune system thinks it was a bit too cold that night, and let itself allow me to have a slight cold or sinus infection. I've been popping that Vitamin C though, getting ready for the big trip next week. And I'll have 'net access too, I think, so even though no one will be reading this during the break, there'll be a  ton  of backlog from me to you. Considering it a wonderfully belated Christmas present to all the readers. And as for this trip.  Totally out of shape. Darn. No promiscuous sex for me. Just kidding, of course. But not only in the bodily sense am I out of shape: I'm also screwed to the fact that I have done nothing in the way of preparation. Just yesterday, while wearing a pair I bore party to the flimsy button on the front POP its way from my shorts to the floor. I stood and laughed for a long time, thinking, "better than at the beach". So it's time to shop! I don't think I've ever said it on this site, but I  loathe  shopping. It makes me want to cry and vomit and drown in a puddle of my own tears and upchuck. Yes, it is literally that bad; however, necessity forces me to do as such, and thusly I shall produce some scuba gear to prevent from dying.   Five days and I'm gone. Five days and it breaks the years' long silence between myself and Florida. I've seen the place, it looks great. I can't wait to get there. I just hope the sun setting doesn't get me all sentimental, as it normally does, for some reason. Not that sentimentality is a bad thing. It's just saddening thinking of myself sitting there reminiscing on days gone by with a semi-smile on my face, and I am all alone. It amazes me sometime how much companionship matters.  All alone, what poisons do love from nature bring?

      Hello everyone.  It seems like its been a year since I posted on here, hasn't it? I thought I had lucked out when I got to Destin, there was an Internet caf down the street from our resort; however, it turns out it was closing the very week we got there, and by the end of the week, the place was ransacked and empty. I've been trying to retain all I wanted to say in this post all week, and I hope I get it all.  Stories...there are too many to start or end with: I saw a billion billion things there, and I could never tell them all. I can tell you I was stung by a sea wasp on the side and around most of my left ankle with a jellyfish tentacle, I was burnt on more than fifty percent of my body over the course of the seven days on that stinging sand under that eventually blazing sun. The blue flag flew the whole time, and the water was amazingly cold, but stepping within was a wonderful sensation nonetheless. I walked  everywhere , five hours straight the first day...and that was where I suffered the first burn.   On one morning the flag was red, and I, alone, stood at the shoreline and watched the waves roll in and collide; it was nothing short of majestic, they smashed together underneath that threatening gray sky, the waves rolled  from  the shore and hit the oncoming waves, and the resulting pillar was feet high. They crashed and rolled again and again, and there I stood for an hour watching them and listening, stricken with awe but giving no more indication than a wide-eyed stare, and later that evening, I did the same with the sun quickly dying, and as the tide reached its highest the ferocity kicked itself up a definite notch, the waters became monsters, the leviathans roared and pulsed their malevolence upon the shores, and, in all reality, took out a dune a few blocks of beach away from our own.   There are a thousand things I could say now, but truly, it was just a trip to the beach. I can put an upside-down spin on this whole situation but it was eight hours in a car, a few days at a beach, and eight days back. The end result though: it was something else, at that beach.  Surreality permeates my brain, and somehow it is blissful.

      Heh, another good run.  I got back a while ago, and so I ran in the dark for my mile and a half. I'm sweating like crazy; today I ran a lot faster than yesterday. It was really nice outside, and some houses were giving off some wonderful and strange smells...laundry perhaps? One of them smelled like the inside of the Nashville Main Library, and I like the way that place smells, so it was a nice run, overall.  And also, while running, I concieved several songs, one named after my partner in this run, thus the song is called  The Night . I also wrote a few more songs:  92 ,  Close My Eyes ,  Redblood ,  Hellshined ,  The Wailing Wall , and  You'll Never Know . It was something else, having such a creativity spree. There isn't anything quite like touching pen to paper and watching everything you want to come out, actually come out. Sometimes I'll sit there and fumble with words and ideas, never getting a clear picture of what I want. And then, there are times like these when it just happens, my mind clicks and everything is  right  for a second, and it isn't painful to write these songs. A few of those off of  Bitter  and mostly all of the songs on the proposed and scrapped second album,  Oh Morose , were ones where I sat in front of the pad wanting to yell because something in my brain sparks up and it triggers all my depression and unhappiness. These gave exactly the same dose of morosity and darkness of the other songs, minus the whole great payment part.  I'm thinking of calling this next project  Dust & Shadows , because it seems like the most prominent songs of this album were concieved under such circumstances; for instance, we recently had a window cut into a new room on the side of the house. The resultant sawdust landed on the ground in front of the garage and was blown around, forming a perfect 92 in the aggregate. Of course, the song has nothing to do with the dust swirl; rather, the time during which I saw the dust sign, and related its oddness to that point in my life. And shadows...I write most of my songs in the near dark, or work them out in my brain right before I doze off every night, or while running or sitting outside after the sun goes down, or while sitting under a tree and whatnot.  These new songs have a lot less to do with loss like the first set does and more with the feeling depression gives, especially  Hellshined  and  Close My Eyes . What a relief to know that I can still write and keep my sanity.

      O, I remember what it was that I wanted to say this morning.  My dreams have turned simply crazy. They've been really weird now, no deaths as of late, but the little shadow figure is still there. He makes himself other people. Like the other day I was a fugitive and he was the lead detective of the FBI, chasing me down. No death, no guns, but something about the pursuit was foremost weird, with an undertone of haunting.  I believe I resolved yesterday's mystery, but I can't be certain.  Somehow I became lead plot designer and an actor for the video project. I hate it, having a talent with voices, I can just hear them and do it, I can assimilate any situation somehow...of course, this time, it screwed me over. Having to write plotlines and whatnot.  And lastly, the God story is coming along just nicely, and wonderfully sacreligiously. Just wait til I get to the Jesus part, I'll bet a few of you will stop reading.  Happy April all.

      Begrudgingly, it's just one of those forgetful days.  I had something I wanted to type in here, but I forgot it. Of course it wasn't important, but still.  I'm working on a story for Elftown. I figure since I'm taking up space with my presence there, I might as well contribute a little, with the best thing I know how to do in the way of art...writing. It was a pretty crazy idea, but I came up with it in the shower this morning (as I do with all crazy ideas). To write the history of man through the eyes of God. Of course, God is a cynic and thinks all human ideas and religions have completely lost it. He toys with his power, he explains the concept of creation and reason for the world's greatest disasters: the Flood, the Black Plague, the Holocaust, and so on, he explains his own creation and the creation of the universe in the best way he knows how...which is, of course, not at all.   It won't be very long. Mostly, it will show coincidences between the plane of God and the mortal realm, and why God think about things the way he does. You might be thinking, "This is probably some staidly religious story, isn't it?" Let me assure you, if God isn't the way he is in this story, and more in the biblical vein of God, I'm going to fry forever. But it's a great idea, I think. Who'd have ever though of the story of the world from the vantage point of the one who made it...slightly twisting commonly accepted ideals about God, however that may be.  This might take a little longer than I thought, though. It's sort of hard to make God sound assured of his power without being overly cocky. I just need to make him sound like he  knows  he is badass, because he is.   And trust in this, it's hard to do it without lapsing into a few lines of God's laughing uproariously at humanity, because it sounds like he's on the verge of it in this story most of the time.

      Chloe was almost lost today. SADNESS.  My mom came to my grandmother's, where I stay after school, and tells me that the guest of the house, good ol' Puss, was missing, perhaps slipped out of a small hole in the back screen door, when, of course, the storm door was opened. I was confident that she would come back, never thinking that she could be in the house. Well, as we come home, I walk'd up the stairs, calling for Chloe the whole time, and Katie happened to say, "Hey, Cloe". It turns out, she was sleeping behind the TV all afternoon and happened to poke a head out to say hello, whereafter she came out and went to play with Camille.  I have rediscovered Alice in Chains. I put in  Facelift  today since I'd wanted to hear  It Ain't Like That , and I ended up listening to the whole thing. WOW. It was really good, so I listened to it again whilst cutting the grass. As for the grass...  The motor stalled twice on the damn. The grass in the ditch is massively grown from the great rains of the winter, I suppose, and our prolong-ed wait in cutting it. The second time it stalled, it also decided that had too little gas to carry on, which was probably the focal reason for its stopping. So I'm left with a mostly cut yard, all except for the stretch in the ditch, which is the longest part. How ANNOYING! I'm a completionist, things have to be done or I don't feel right. When I pull out of the drive tomorrow to go to school I'll probably look over and have a schizoid episode followed by a heart attack.  Diablo II is a great game, I've come to find. I've been playing it a lot lately. Level 23 Druid, I need one more level before I have enough strength to wear Plate Mail. Heh, as if you all cared.  By the way, who called my cellphone on Monday around noon? Give me a call or something, I got your message and it sounded like "Lindsey" or "Lizzie", and I know it couldn't be Lindsey Reid because of the time, Lindsey, my sister's friend, because she doesn't have this number and she hates me, to top it all off, and I don't know any Lizzies...at least I guess I don't. And if it was someone else, I apologize, I just couldn't make it out. Someone is talking at the end, and they say something like "who the fuck..."...I forgot the rest, but it sounds an  awful lot  like me. I played it for Kenzie and she said, "Dude, it sounds just like you!". We went through the list of suspects and couldn't figure out who it was.  GOD, curiosity, such bliss and suffering, you have bagg-ed your cat.

      Well guys, I tell you now: I am more tired than ever.  Yes, the dreams again. Still I've constantly got them. They feature people in my everyday-thoughts: it's just that as the dreams progress, they metamorphisize, something about them changes. They grow slits for eyes, they become dismembered. Either this, or they have subtle changes: their hair gets longer, their eyes change color, their height changes. Something always changes. And always, something in the dream is not as it is supposed to be; rather, it defies my everyday outlook upon these same people: for example, people whom I see to be talkative and generally like me become withdrawn and quiet, and it is these that change the most, first with subtlety, and then progressing. Others, whom I see to hate me are my best friends, I've had girlfriends I'd never thought to be as such in these dreams. And it goes the other way too: people I hate, I like them, and vice versa. People die, people get killed in front of me, there tends to be a little shadow that sits in other peoples' shadows and kills them when a conversation or events are starting to get really exciting or someone thinks that they're about to die somehow. And sometimes it's just quiet. And others, it's just standing around talking about random stuff while the people change and other, background people die, or arbitrarily stand there as I and the subject do.  Sorry for drawing this out so much, but these just have to stop. Everytime I wake up from one I sit there and think,  O, it was just a dream , at first, and then I start to think,  Was it? , and that's when the panic starts to set in, and I have to sit in place holding my head and staring out the window, trying to get it out of my brain. Last night's had one good one and three semi-bad ones. The good one had to do with kites and rain and people dressed strangely. The others had to do with that shadow killing off some of my best friends. Yes readers, to sate your curiosity,  all  of you have strangely died in these dreams, they've been going on for the past three weeks or so, and my brain has had enough time to deal a mortal blow to each of you, at least, the ones I know that read this. That, and/or you've been strangely disfigured as the dream goes on, and I must say, you all can turn into some  strange  things.  Cut the shit so I can get some sleep, guys, please? OK, so I'm kidding, it's only mines fault. Just bear with the next few posts, these will go on until the next thing happens, I think, and it always does.   It's never been long before, has it?

      I have a few things to say. Firstly, is parthenophobia. This is, primarily, an incurable fear of virgins.  Nextly is sexophobia, which is fear of the opposite sex.  And lastly is nihilism, less a phobia and more an outlook on life, epitomizing pessimism, which focuses on the idea that life is entirely  hopeless . Sounds like someone I know?  Yeah yeah, you can all put your fingers down now.

      Ok, so the shooting is over.  It turned out pretty good, I'd say. The battle scene was really fun, we had some AK death, execution-style, we had people trying to beat other people with sticks, we had Lightsabres, and it was really fun. And death, death,  death . Perhaps not the most realistic death ever, but death, nonetheless. This weekend we have to finish the mixdown and turn it all in. I hope we win, I heard the other ones really sucked this year. But the judges still got bribed really well, and I think they'll be fine, even if the movies really  do  suck.  Too cold! Filming was horrible! The cold kept making me forget my lines and want to quit, or get it over with as quickly as possible. And then I heard people talking about how the script sucked and the film was awful. Well maybe, fuckers, had you taken the damned time to help with the script instead of jacking off with the other morons outside making signs that were all torn down just yesterday, then the script and film could have aspects that you would like in it! Personally, they have absolutely NO right to complain, and it BURNS me to even think they could sit with such smugness in their infallibilities, never reasoning that the root of the problem could be in themselves.   I don't think everyone is stupid. O wait, I lied.

      Today is "Be Silent for the Gay and Straight Alliance" Day. If you actually believe that gay people, in fact, need this special rite, then by all means, why not be silent for the next 24 hours. And if you're like me and think that they're people just like everyone else, then laugh at the people that are being silent and talk your ass off. Either way, it's a day.  I get to dress up and shoot people and talk like a redneck today. What a suprise that it all happens in last period.  Fareyouwell.

      The day begins again.  It's looking to be an ambiguous day. Last night was fun, I played  Chrono Cross  for about an hour for lack of anything else to do, went upstairs, hit the lights, and knew no more.  Well, I talked to my dad first, and he helped to alleviate some of that emotional distress I was talking about yesterday. My dad's a good guy, he can't do anything but justify my problems, which, I tell myself, is just teaching me that all the wrong directions I'm taking in my life are the right ones; but somehow I'm able to get his real message and things turn out better. It seems like his old girlfriend, the one that made me all screwed up last year, has started talking to him seriously, and he told me some vaguely suprising stuff. That he still cares for her in the way he did before, he says not much has changed since he talked to her last. At the same time, it's not a surprise, considering how involved they were, despite that relationship's brevity. At the same time, she's married, but I speculate she has the same feelings. It's causing my dad some undue distress; and that little segment only took two of the thirty minutes, which can tell you how much we can talk about in a short time.  Time for me to go.

      Had a heart attack and died.  Well, I cut the bottom of the yard today, and the mower stalled about seven times, but after much undue toil and effort, I was able to get it done, albeit poorly. Afterwards, something in my head called me to go for a run, which I did; after the first lap, however, I tripped up the drive and slammed into the door, took a bit of the great ambrosial raspberry drink, sat outside, and recovered. It was a nothing-doing day thereafter.  Something vaguely troubling happened today. God, I hate dealing with these emotional struggles.

      Thieves.  It came to pass that after seeing  Phone Booth  with a few friends on Saturday, I went to a the best take-out Chinese restaurant in Nashville, Hunan Express, where I got a Hunan-style beef and two egg rolls. But that's besides the point. As I was driving home, my dad beside me and I at the wheel, I drove by "the car".  This car has been sitting here since two summers ago. It's an old blue car, it looks sort of like the Shelby from  Gone In Sixty Seconds , and it is in the worst possible position, half-way on the road at the veritable apex of the curve leading to my dad's house. As we drove by, I told my dad my plans for my sixteenth birthday in two months: I'm going to drive the car to the very place I was presently at in that road, take a crowbar, and bash that thing until it was little more than a crushed Pepsi can. Suddenly my dad became very somber while saying, "You could put that to a more practical use," We pulled into the driveway.  As we sat there, he said, "What's different?" After making several guesses about a change to the house, even being so optimistic as to infer that something had been done to the house: he said it was something bad. After further pushing, he told me: someone had stolen my bike.  I didn't ride the bike much, I was going to when I first bought it, but it needed a lot of work and no one was really listening to me when I said as such; plus, this summer gave me little incentive to do so: this of course, is the reason why I didn't notice it at first. Afterward, my dad gave me the speculation that someone had cut the padlock and taken not only the bike, but the broken padlock and chain as well. I was stunned at first, then I was angry, and almost backed out of the drive to start looking: my dad informed me that he had already been doing that since it had been stolen...  But the bigger suprise: it happened while I was in Destin, on Thursday, he even heard it when it happened and disreguarded it. It  was  a pretty quiet neighborhood, I thought as I walked inside. Of course, to add insult to injury, as we were watching TV that night, a white Cavalier was being pursued by three blazing police cars. My dad and I gave each other a look, whereafter he took his gun from his backpack, unbuttoned the fasten for the holster, put it down on the coffee table, and continued watching our  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  second season on DVD, woot!  That is a pretty good show, by the way.  Which is better: to be optimistic, or to be realistic? Optimism for comfort, realism for reality. Is reality such a good thing? Is it even necessary anymore? Humanity subverts its reality with TV and video games, with the Internet, they subvert their love with pornography, they subvert their beliefs with the good guys in the movie, they are serial murderers with a license to kill, they are puppeteers with the right to control humans as they see fit. It really leaves one to wonder if the world should be entirely optimistic, because, truly, their is no more reality to address.  We can make our own now, anyway.

      One more thing:  I had some dream last night, I can't remember what it was exactly, just that it was bombastic, fast, it was confusing, and I woke up bewildered but motionless two hours early, stared at the ceiling and drifted to the shower later on. Remember before when the dreams consisted of elements of life that weren't right? This was all of them combined, I think, the world simply wasn't right. A song set it off,  Numb  by Linkin Park. I fell asleep with that song in my head and it played through most of the dream, and moreover, the chorus. Look up the song sometime, try  urlLink here . I'm not sure why but it did.  Silly chronicles of life.

      They say that our skit was awesome. I'm impressed.  Although some things sucked. But o well, that's the way indy-produced movies are. I have yet to see it, cannot wait for seventh, which is when we might see it. The suspense is killing me. See?, I just died. Never mind me, I'm on drugs.  Time to get back in the studio, we're going to finish  Bitter , get some gigs, then start working on  Dust & Shadows  which, believe it or not, has all the work done for it already. Yes, I have no live.  The sun's out, thank god.

      Hi all.  Coach King said our skit was the "best, but the least technologically-endowed". That was kind of a bolster. We have a research paper in there, which was assigned our class on Friday; I've already finished it, mostly before I went to the DI meet...oh yeah, that.  I sucked. It was horrible. I died. We got second to last, we bombed the instant challenge, I sucked in the skit so there was really nothing to go on. I realize how much everyone was relying on me to shine in that thing, but I simply couldn't think fast enough. It was as if my brain was numb that day. After the fact I went and sat by myself for a while, I called my dad and talked to him for a while, I talked to my mom because I had before, telling her about how we blew it on the instant challenge, but just before I called her, as I was about to press the button to call her, in fact, I got a call from Rosie; it was a startling bolt of clarity in the midst of that depressive soup.  After the competetions were over, the team went across the street for pizza, and we explored a book shop next door, looking for a copy of  The Necronomicon  among other things, and swapping stories about the occult in the spellbook section of the place, located far in the back of the store. I came home and slept; what else was there to do? Moreover, what else did I want to do? I got into a few fights with my dad that day. It's starting to hurt me a lot, to have to fight with people. Lately, I've notice that I've been catching myself before I'm about to say something that'll set someone off. I can't believe I was so stupid as to think humanity was my toy. Sorry all.  It's weird, when I start fighting with someone these days; I just want to disappear, or cry, anything but start fighting. I can't understand it, it isn't like me at all.   Maybe it's just lack of sleep, maybe puberty giving way to maturity; whatever the case, it feel awful, and I hope I can stand up until it ends.

      HEYA all. I'm in Spring Day, and the practices were yesterday...well, one of them.

      Whoa guys.  Spring Day was great. I can't really say everything that happened in the short time I have with a computer these days...you'll just have to see the tape, if you can. It was incredible. The tape is really intense too, sorta. Not as good as when I was there. And the MOSH PIT. GOOD GOD. Short and sweet, some guy's mouth exploded where he got hit. Poor sucker, I salute him. And the stage, I was doing lil' jumps and trampolining off of it, I was sure it was gonna break; but no, it'll be ready for next year.  I sent some more invites, I wonder if they got through.

      I guess we've got this resolved...  I'm worried about Marissa...I have a feeling she's going to fuck everything up before I'm able to end this. Marissa really isn't smart, she's all mouth and no mind, and that's a huge problem. She has parrot syndrome, she repeats everything she says without thinking about its effects.   I just need to finish out my little thought processes about this whole deal and figure out what needs to be said. This doesn't need to go on any more, in any way.  I'm not studying tonight; I don't really care. How interesting, I used to be the little geek kid who would be spending his night studying; now I'm worrying about "social situations". Wish me luck Monday, by the way.  "Uh hello parents of Little Chin....Rosie Jiang, this is the police, calling to ask about Ms. Jiang about her involvement in crimes committed the first of May 2003 which, we think, she might have borne witness to, may I speak with her?...thank you....Hello, Ms. Jiang?.....HEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYY ROSIE HAVIN' FUN STUDYING HAHAHAAHAHHAA YOU THOUGHT I WOULDN'T CALL BUT I DID AND YOUR PARENTS FELL FOR IT WHAT A GREAT NIGHT IT'S GOING TO......."

      For fun, I never responded to it and it was an interesting thread. And I was really bored and lonely in the library that day.  Well antiphilanthropists, well......  It's all coming to a head. If you read my post in "The Blog" yesterday (which is probably when you'll be reading this), then you'll know what I'm talking about in this post. I really need to stress the pointlessness in having this get-together this weekend.  Let me put it this way, and I'm sure everyone can agree. If you thought for one minute that I would ever agree with someone else's opinion that wasn't entirely like mine when it came to this matter, you are wrong, dead wrong. If I had to pick a solution to this problem, I would take plan number one (mentioned by Lindsey), because if Rosie and Becca have some time to cool their jets they might actually be those adults we're wanting them to be and this situation will close like a storybook. If we let them have at it and try to interject, someone is going to say something they might regret, and it might just cause not only Rosie and Becca to fall apart, but the rest of us as well.   If you're really planning to follow through on this, please remember: one, try to keep your head; two, I am behind those of you who would do as such one hundred thousand percent, and will certainly be there when it happens; and three, no matter what I say, and no matter what is said to me, each and every one of you will still be some of the best friends I have ever had; I'm not quite sure anyone realizes what an impact each of you have made on what I've become, and GOD forbid I'd ever forget that.  And now that the sentimentality is over, we await the bomb to go off, watching the timer as it clicks down to total oblivion...or maybe the fuse is faulty; but in the end, only time will tell.  Just like everything else, only time will tell.

      Posted by Rosie on the 31 of January: (*don't even ask why I'm doing this*)  "Have you realized how fake our society is. I mean think about it.....the whole world believes that everyone has there place and if they leave it......here comes the tidal waves. Crossing social barriers in BHS is next to impossible without whispers and stares. Is this what they call America, the most welcome country? Everyone plays to the role untill that role is all they have, so they stick to that role through life then pass it to there children. Ugg why can't people be themselves. Why can't people NOT fit the mold for once?"  "Slowly all the roles we act out become our identity, and in the end we are what we pretend to be" said Jerry once. It's like being a pack of animals, people will find a common ground and build on it, and that's how we get our social classes. Unless someone is truly  above  all of this shit, and it would be sort of nice to be that way, but it's unlikely. Social distinction, just another one of those shit consequences of having to be alive in the New Age.  And an Elizabethan reply (from Z, of course) for this post for anyone interested, on the 31: thereafter I posted all the lyrics to Poor Bastard, etc., more whining, then some more whining, DI, and on and on....oh yeah, the reply:  "Hey, Rosie, just a question. Why do you care? I for one am perfectly happy in my lack of social standing. I have thought of this subject before, however, and have decided that I don't care. And since when do I fit the mold? I'm one example. There have to be others. Linds, maybe."  .Dne eht

      Ok, posting again because it's pretty boring in this library.  Nobody showed up...well, those that typically occupy the library at this time, and I'll be damned if I'm going back to Rau for the next 55 minutes.  The Biology gateway practice was a joke. If I don't get a hundred I'm going to bleed myself for slacking.   Umm, I had something else to say but I forgot. Heh. Suprise. Time to go back and do some Euro I guess.  What a boring SOB I've become. Augh.

      Ok, just checking.  Someone else's dream? Do you think so? It had occurred to me once that we might just be the figments of something else's imagination. Not limited to God, or "gods" for that matter, just that we are the stuff of dreams, much like the things we see during sleep.   It also coincides with the argument, "How do I know that you're real? I know I'm real, but I don't know if you are or not,"...speaking from one putting drastic emphasis on the falsity of the physical facade, of course. What the hell am I saying? Heh.  I just got done with my lil' review sheet for 5th, so I'm in contemplative mode, and it was a topic that I've thought about before. Whether or not you intended it to be that way is the question...and I'm guessing not :)  An hour and fifteen minutes to go...

      FUCKING BLOG. I was posting just now and the damn thing bombed on me and kilt my whole post. So let me try to remember what I was saying.  As a forenote: WOOHOO STICKERS I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE ZEM. And for the intro: Hiya people (and yes, this was the actual text of the first post, but that's about all I can remember).  It looks like Stranglebox is about to take off. We're hitting the studio tomorrow to record some new songs for the first EP, which once was called "Anorexia" and is now  Ignorance  (named after  someone  after a conversation Alex and I were having about it...that's the way most of these albums get named)... Dreamed ,  Somewhere ,  Guilty Conscience , and  Let Me Go . And in addition to  Broken Me , that's equal to five songs, which is the limit for a demo EP that some record guys have wanted. Interviews with record guys means  record contract .  Record contract  means   BONUS  !!!!!!! Finally, after all this time we just might nail that interview...and I had to write a whole new album for it......Christ, am I anal. But it was worth it...I can't see how we're even going to match this one, it's just too heavy....it's got elements of metal, and hiphop, and punk, and grunge, and alternative, and plain old fucking nuts, but the end result, even if you're not a fan of one of the aforementioned, is total ass-kickage. Where has this inspiration been all my life? How'd I ever think to incorporate hiphop into  MY  music, ME for god's sake, master advocate of  DOWN WITH FUCKING RAP . I blame Linkin Park, personally.  Tomorrow is the party for Will and I...and probably Becca. This is going to be FUCKED UP, team. Uhoh, I can see lots of problems there. But come what may......I need to learn to say that in another language, so it'll sound cooler.   Hope everyone's enjoying their CDs ('cept Rosie...I was up 'til one thirty making those CDs, and I woke up early to finish  YOURS  and test them all....thanks a lot....but Will has it now so it's all good), and be expecting the  Ignorance  EP soon enough....or LP, shit if I know these record terms.  Bedtime, starting early tomorrow. Eagh.

I'm excited.  And um, oh yeah.  I got a 90 on my math project.  Woot!  Anyway, just thought I'd break the silence.  I keep forgetting you're back.  But I'm glad you are.

      Sweet guys, came back from the ER just now.  I got bitten by a spider. Woowoo. I was sleeping, then I woke up. I ate dinner, and my chewing became harder and harder to accomplish. I went to the bathroom mirror, and there was a huge white lump surrounded by a red circle. The outside bite got pretty bad but stopped. The inside one kept going til it got most of the gum below my teeth. We put ice on it and it stopped eventually, then we waited for someone to look at me in the ER for an hour. They said it was probably a spiderbite, and I shouldn't worry about it unless it starts getting big and purple, in which case it's time to go back for gangrene treatments induced by black widow/brown recluse bites. Then they gave me a tetinus shot...I've never looked at myself getting a shot before, so it was pretty cool...but those damned things are painful...whoa.   I stole a surgical glove, an ear inspector plastic disposable mahicker, and a tongue depressor, and in the lobby they had a basket of stickers, from which I took a Scooby Doo one; Scooby's awesome head is now betwixt my pickups, along with a sticker from one of my sister's magazines, which is orange, and simply says "Maybe?" If you all have any more stickers, I'd love to have them, I want to make my guitar look awesome.  The two ss's in  Broken Me  are "I never thought that / It all would come back around". Looking at the lyrics right now. I didn't have a session today for obvious reasons, but I did rerecord  Broken Me ...the new one sounds a lot louder and personally, horrible. But I'll do my best.   This 5th situation is spiraling out of control, just like I predicted, nobody can agree with anyone else, plus the fact that we're always getting off topic...I think that's a positive thing though, if you forget about things like these, they really do go away.  "That heathen devil weed, marijuana!"

      Hmm, silent BLog.  Well considering there's been a new Stranglebox release, I guess I should post the lyrics, as I always do. This song is called  Broken Me    Broken Me  by Stranglebox  All wrong I know this ain't the right way Playing ping-pong Became the toy of my fate ss ss I wasn't thinking And all the sudden I'm down I'm like a fly trapped On a field full of glue My brain is ransacked All telling me what to do I'll never hear you Never ever again I'll make these words true As soon as I put down this pen  Hey hey, see me in between See this twisted dream It's just a seam Of what I might have been Hey hey, you're a broken lie To you it don't seem right To waste another day, it seems So loose the broken me who bleeds  So long I couldn't take anymore I guess I got strong And I walked right out the door You'll never hear me But you know I'll never care I had a vision Selfish, you blew it like air I'm just so tired I don't wanna do this again It's uninspired But I loved losing my head I'm going out there I'm falling into the trap Nothing left to share And it came to the point that I snapped  CHORUS  Something has touched me and I'll never be the same Something has touched me and I'll never be the same (bleed me out)  CHORUSx2  The end. It sounds so amazing, but I have to rerecord the whole thing because of a mistake, so it might be a while. Lots of rock-rap, kind of odd for me...but I sound ok. Uh, those ss's are where I forgot the words...heh, I was singing from the paper. And I screamed the whole second verse, in addition to rapping it...you guys  need  to hear this.

      Oh well...it won't really matter in a few more hours.  I had an awesome weekend...sorry for the optimism all, but it was great. First I went to the Renaissance festival on Saturday, which was totally cool, and then I went to a drivers' training course thing called "Driver's Edge", where they teach you to maneuver under extreme conditions :) Today was oversteering: basically, you spin your car out going as fast as you can, and then try to regain control. That was fun, we got to drive Camaros...god, those cars are bitchin'. Then, we went for antilock break testing and swerve control using a cone course and BMW 325is. I was the VERY FIRST PERSON TO GO. After the instructor showed us what to do (that is, gun it and hope the breaks work before you careen off into a ravine full of trees...no exaggeration at all, by the way, and grenading the breaks, then circling around and swerving to miss a wall of cones at top speed and mashing the breaks again...and then doing it a second time for good measure) I hopped out of the car screaming at the crowd to run away while they still could. Alex and a kid named Lonnie were in my car. They were just looking wide-eyed and the crowd was laughing at my yelling...I have no idea why the  hell  they would do that, I was  serious , I've never been so scared to pull a trick like that in my life. You think the Camaros are bad, and then...  So I got into the seat, and on the first run it's just to test if you can hit the breaks hard enough. I was good on the first one, though he made me wait a lot longer than anyone else to put them on. The swerving was fun. Then the second time, the narrow miss of the ravine. The only problem was,  I DIDN'T HIT THE BREAKS HARD ENOUGH . So he pulled the parking break and all was well. They said I was second place for the ABS Course trophy, and first for Best Screaming :) I got a T-shirt and a car maintenence kit. And it was all free too, care of manymanymany sponsorships, which were tattooed outside of a model monster truck sitting in the parking lot...this was all at the Opryland Hotel, by the way.  So there's my weekend, how about yours?

      *snicker* to Lindsey's post.  Uh, that would be awesome Rosie, it's been really bothering me as to the why of that.  Evil? Me?! *SOBBING* THANK YOU THANK YOU! My life's work is complete, I have been considered a being of debauchery and rape and scandal and can now die a happy, happy little blasphemous infidel. It's really early in the morning guys, so I'm totally screwed up beyond all comprehension. It's been a day. And I'm trying to write the essay and it's hard because it's a lot to put in and think about. A LOT.  I played Aetolia all day...an offshoot of Achaea. God was it fun, I forgot how fun it was since my old, awesome character got deleted.  I'm such an incredible loser it's not even funny.

      Hey Rosie.  I noticed you posted the greatest song ever ( Iris  by the Dolls, off the  Dizzy Up The Girl  album, track number eleven, and yes, I'm done) in your BLog.....cool but, why?  I think I posted it once....yes, I  urlLink did , it's a beautiful song just for the lyrics, if you haven't heard it yet, although almost everyone has, and it's even better to music. Ok, done, I'm sort of on a Dolls kick right now so it was pretty cool to read Johnny Rzeznik in thine place du postage.

      Will......  AsShOLe  . Heh.  Trust that if there was raping, it wouldn't be intentional, by any means. And, of course, there's a bunch of girls going and the majority of my immediate family. Last I checked, they weren't completely psychotic...but don't quote me on that.  Christ guys, you grow out your hair a little and look like a stoner when in fact you're just really Italian, and all hell breaks loose.  And the 100982095124571298347123 page essay tomorrow. And guys, it'll be great.  The best yet, I daresay.

      don't worry Rosie,  Lindsey's parents are just worried (unjustifibly) that josh and his friends would gang up on lindsey as the single girl and do some unkind things to her.  If they seriously thought he would rape her they wouldn't let her go.  Additionally, I think lindsey could take josh if she wanted to. . .

Let's ennebreate this a bit and say I have the worst luck of anyone in the entire world, and I have some people that can testify to that. And I'll publish the essay this weekend to celebrate my longest time without having a "woe fucking me" speech.   For now, I need to go record and stop my guts from fucking aching me to death.   Death, what a novel and wonderful idea.

      Sweet guys, just got back from the ER.  Sounds familiar? This week it was my mom, who cut herself on a running hedge trimmer thrice today and suffered severe bloodloss and a mild fracture. It's all my fault too...eagh, sitting in the waiting room last week, I said to myself, "why's this happening to me? why can't this happen to someone else?"...and so now, of course, that I've said that, everyone around me is going to die, and I'm going to be the last one standing...is that all for the better?  Christ guys, I hope this week shapes up because thus far it sucks, just like last week and the week before.  EAGH.

      Josh i put your cd in RealPlayer for Windows, and turned on "SRS WOW Effects" and the echo in Broken me suddenly went about three times as deep ( as in several echos, not pitch)  you should look into this I think it would make a great effect if you put on the cd.

      Oh yeah.....  I'm aware that the recorded vocals on the acoustical  My Solution  are pretty bad because I'm trying to put the rocking chorus on an acoustical song...sorry all, it was about twelve in the morning. So the next CD is going to have revamped vocals that actually sound fitting to the song this time, rather than butchering it as I did and leaving the lackluster result on the product.  Eagh.

      It's cool. There'll be more on there later that have been remixed and sound better. She refused because "I didn't have her in mind when I made  Broken Me  as a single". I don't think of some people for the same reason I don't tend to give Julian any of my singles: all he'll do is sit there and whine about how horrible it is, how the vocals suck, how the production was crap, how I can't play, etc. It gets to a point where I sort of know what to expect, so I just back down from trying to get people to listen and like something I do since I already know what they're going to say.  TWO NEW SONGS! Of course,  Little Rhyme  has been done forever, but in my room on recording day I wrote the chorus; the words in the verses have never been changed, though. The other song is  Let Me Go (The Tip of My Tongue) ...this song is just violent. I wrote it last night and in about three hours when my dad decides to wake up, I'm going to go upstairs, lock myself in my room, and record it until I die, or finish. This is going to be hard, for what I have in mind.  But, as tradition, the lyrics:   Little Rhyme  by Stranglebox  Father father, where'd you go Calling out to no one Empty, sullen, all alone Mercy to my mission Brother brother, moaning low Living ruination Crying crying, time is slow Sleep in devastation  CHORUS So I pray you'll be alright Cuz all my other prayers have died And I hope you'll turn out right Cuz you've been otherwise denied Now I say my little rhyme Little comfort passing time And you had every right to lie And so for that I'll say goodbye  Mother mother, no one knows Just how deep this chasm Sunder, plunder, I did so I produced this spasm Sister sister, I'd forego Anything to save me Killed it, killed it, bloody clothes Falsity depraves me  CHORUS SOLO CHORUSx2  See, these songs aren't too complicated, and that's what makes them beautiful. Next one...this song was originally intended to be a "rhythm singing" song, and has existed in some form or another for a week or so now, but it's turned into actual singing now, it's kind of eerie considering the rest of the song is screaming and such, and I mean  real  screaming this time, none of that  My Solution  sing-screaming stuff, full-out RC schtick.   Let Me Go (The Tip of My Tongue)  by Stranglebox  CHORUS Everything I see reminds me of you Every lie you paint a picture untrue Everything I've loved has bled me right through And no matter what I do you just won't (let me go) The cap on the jar of my pain is unscrewed Now there's nothing left in me I could do I used to be the one but I'm split in two And no matter what I do you just won't (let me go)  Condescention, never mention Everything left is lies and pretentions What I was and what I will be Doesn't really matter cuz it never was me I Sit back and wear the mask And never really take my turn When it comes to the fact I'm loathe to react Just wanna sit back and watch it burn  CHORUS  Verbal violence, that or silence Negative sentiment that day and since Used t be the bleeder and I took the whip But I found the gun so I shoot from the hip I Take out the time to crawl back inside And hide within myself Tiptoe on the faultline before it snaps And opens straight to my little hell  CHORUS  You've got a long way You're still so young But I've grown beyond my years With many songs been sung I wait and never relate The everything I've done But even with your hand on my mouth I can shout Cuz I've got you And the words on the tip of my tongue  LET ME GO x 8  CHORUS  LET ME GO x4 GO x 5  Angry angry angry! Whee! The "still so young" part is the calm before the storm, and then we bust it out and kill someone with the LET ME GOs; the drums are going to get really fast and the guitar is going to bottom out and sound like shit, which is just what any little metal junkie is looking for. I can't wait much longer to put this thing down.

      Today was very bad.  Not for any descript reason...it was just one of those days where I woke up and said, "O shit, today's a really bad day," Not that there was anything bad about it...more like, I had convinced myself that something was wrong with today, and the whole world went down from there. It's like...I ran out of Cokes, I tried writing and couldn't, I wrote huge responses to posts...and then rethought them all together and wrote one line that doesn't really say anything. You know the way these days go. It was a "stranglebox" so to speak.  I'm so tired for some reason. Kind of sad when I realize that it's summer, and tiredness coupled with summer just cannot reasonably coexist.   There's No "I" In Team  by Taking Back Sunday  Well I can't regret it Can you just forget it I started something I couldn't finish If we go down, we go down together Best friends means What best friends means  And I've got a twenty dollar bill That says you're up late night starting Fist fights versus fences In you backyard Wearing your black eyes like A badge of honour Soaking in sympathy From friends who never loved you Nearly half as much as me  Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to You don't believe me when I tell you It's just what anyone would do Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you It's something unforgiveable  Well I can't regret it Can you just forget it I started something I couldn't finish If we go down, we go down together Best friends means What best friends means  You never knew Well I never told you Everything I know about breaking hearts I learned from you, it's true I've never done it with the style and grace you have But I've made long-term plans Based on these mistakes  Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to Don't believe me when I tell you It's just what anyone would do Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you It's something unforgiveable  Is this what you call tact? I swear you're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back So let's end this call And end this conversation There's nothing worse (That's right he said, that's right he said it) I swear you have no idea The jealousy that became me thinking That you always had it way too easy  Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to You don't believe me when I tell you It's just what anyone would do Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you It's something unforgivable  Best friends means I pulled the trigger,  Best friends means you get what you deserve...

      Heh, well yeah, you could come if I was still having it. Not this weekend, I wanted to try and get sometime where I can get everyone at the same time. On a side note, why do you keep thinking I hate so you so much?   Where do I pull the lyrics from? As in, how do I write them or where do I get the inspiration for them?...although that is virtually the same question. Or do you mean, where would you find them...although that isn't the question, now is it? The lyrics to all of my  recorded  songs are on this page somewhere, in case that, in fact,  is  the query.  Inspiration is a very tricky thing. It's about taking pieces of negative and positive sentiments and putting them on paper. It's taking what I see and making words meld with it, and at times, it's very hard. Any lyricist will tell you, writing good lyrics isn't about thinking about the words involved, it's about getting a message across. If you're good enough, you'll know what words to use, you just need to figure out where to put them; it's hard tho, because it makes me focus on things I'd rather not think about most of the time...it's about depression and anger for nearly 75 percent of them, and the other 25 is about being ignorant so as to prevent hurting myself ( Close My Eyes ), letting go of something, learning something through pain ( Hollow feats make a man of the meek ) and the occasional death anthem a la Metallica, although it's been about three years since I wrote one of those.

      Ugh, guys...  I think my dad and his old girlfriend, the one that drove me to the point of psychotic break, are starting to get back together. And if that happens, I'm going to be really pissed off for as long as it lasts, or I'll get used to it, and I'll be a generally pissed off person. And then again, it might not happen. But I seriously doubt that shit.  I used to be really tortured by it, most of last year was pretty bad for me because of my dad...Rosie might have noticed during those little conversations during Aldridge, but I wouldn't think it likely.  I know you all would like to say that you'll stand behind me and help...but it really comes down to me and my dad alone in this house, along with her over the 'Net; when I'm all alone, there's no help to be given. So it just scared me that I might even be remotely encountered with this possibility. But I'm going to shut up now and knock on wood and pray I'll be alright, so goes one of my songs a bit edited.

      Read my reply to your last taunt-inspired post if you haven't already LilChi.  And the lyrics to the new song.   Close My Eyes  by Stranglebox  Hey you there are you listening? I won't be ignored again Outside here, it's a lonely place and I'm Trying to figure out where this began  CHORUS I'm apart and struck at the heart The whole world hears my cries And you thieved to the point of deceit But if you care, please close my eyes Another down, my pain is renowned The thorn is in my side Hollow feats make a man of the meek And if you care, please close my eyes  Hey I'm here and I'm thinking about Why I never went away I've been trying hard to live without Your sweet touch within my brain  CHORUS a few times, nothing special  It's so damned simple, but it's really awesome, minus the shoddy production job, as usual.

      Evil wench. I was supposed to have my car already, but the guy pulled back and thought he could get more money for it elsewhere, but that he would call us if that plan fell through. And you getting a license...HAHA. Another...well, several months I guess, three and a half, even? Compared to moi, who is holding it and has taped it to the screen where your post is so it can saturate your taunt with the sad truth: that you're still a damned kid, and that's all that matters :)

      Why thank you Will, and thank you everyone for your well wishes. It's been an amazing day.  The test....well, I waited about an hour, I got the forms, I sat for another two hours. Then they called me up. I took the vision test and got it perfect....20/40 perfect, that is. Then they gave me over to my supervisor, a one-armed man whose stump was incredibly versatile. It was amazing. But that's besides the point. He was really anal, and for that, I received two error marks...but that doesn't matter cuz it takes seven to fail. WOO, so I got it. It looks horrible, this new beige colour with yellow. But I got it, nonetheless. So I say to my mom:  "Mom, do you still have that check from Gran (pet name for my paternal grandmother) in your purse?" "Yep, sure do." "Ok, well let's go cash it." "Ok." "And then I'm going to go to Backyard Burgers." "Ok." "ALONE." "Oh...um, well...ok."  I went. I got the number one with tea, and I sat on the trunk of my car in the parking lot laughing to myself and be generally optimistic, answering any questions as to why I was so happy. Then I finished and went home with a CD blasting. I sat around, I went to the party at my grandmother's and got 90 bucks, which is  awful  considering I got 430 about six years ago. Dammit. And my grandmother gave me a little toy car and a keychain, "for when you get it, and there's something to wet your appetite with"...those a-holes. I got my cellphone back and FINALLY got to hear all of those messages, so if you called in the last five days I'll be getting back to you really soon...tomorrow. A few surprises actually. It's been a great day, just because of those messages. The fact that I got six was awesome, but some of the content therein was really nice, as well. I'm rambling.  That's awesome guys, I have a license and no tricked out ride to be mackin' my hoz with. Shiet biatch. I might get a car pretty soon, but I dunno. Even when I get it, I can't have people with me, says mother. But what she doesn't know can't kill her, right? At least for now when I don't have that problem.  Thanks again all.

      Like I said, you'll never find it.   Actually Z,  nothing  has happened. I don't even do anything on here anymore, I don't have anything to whine about, I put most of the band stuff on  urlLink Stranglebox ...mostly, everyone comes in and reminisces about how awesome Antiphilanthrophy used to be, and then they leave and do whatever. And yes, COLOUR! I got sick of the drabness and had to liven it up a bit.  Anyway, addressing the first line of this post...you'll never find it. I made it extremely difficult to near-impossible by not making it a public BLog. It's still out there, it just can't be searched for. And to find it, you would have to experiment with different website addresses. A worthless hint, I just wrote a new song and put it as the address of the website. And again, you'll never find it. HAHAHAHAHA. That was kind of the point though, so that I could finish it and then post it. I'm just not doing it here because of it's sheer size...and I don't want comments on the work in the making, because that would screw up most of the story line and I would be PISSED. Especially since this is taking a billion years to work out. There's mini-essays to sort through, lots of lyrics, conversations to remember, letters to re-read...mostly, lots of stuff to remember, sequence, and write down. It isn't incredibly hard, it just takes time to figure out which piece goes where...most of the year I took as a single strand of conciousness, and now I have to take that thread and unweave it into its most essential elements.  It should be done by the end of summer or so...ok, not that long. It'll take a long while, but I'll get a lot done this weekend...after the part on Saturday of course, and it should be finished before you know it. A lot of it, all of you know already, since most of you star in it in some way or another. Basically, if you've read this site and TinHaven on a regular basis for the last two months or so, and I have open communication with you, you have a part in it somewhere. And then, there's stuff that's been in the BLog before and will be posted as part of the story again (i.e.: the "goodbye" letter, etc.). God, you're all going to love it and hate me for some things you never thought I knew but actually did know anyway. HATE, I can taste it already.  GUYS IT'S MY BIRTHDAY HAPPY B-DAY TO ME. Surprised that I made it this far. Pray for me on the driver's liscense test tomorrow, I'm more worried about the eye exam than the test, but it would be nice to have support nevertheless. When I pull up to your houses by myself in a car tomorrow, grinning my cheeks off, imagine the feeling of sheer joy and excitement you'd get from knowing that you well-wished to a good cause.  Propaganda is awesome.

      What the hell are you talking about?  The big post is out there somewhere, if you can find it, congrats, but it won't be easy. I promise that it  will  be here as soon as I finish it...which won't be soon, it's in 20 parts with little side-stories, and I'm only on the first side-story, at the beginning of part four. I haven't been working on it enough.   If you happen to see it on the updated BLog list on  urlLink blogger.com's homepage  sometime, the website is called  An Account of Apathy, Concern, and Everything In Between .  Good luck on finding it. But otherwise, wait for it, wait for it, it's not even near done. Yes, it's that big.

      OK guys, let's pretend I'm not really fucked up for a moment and taking it all out on Rosie. I'm having some problems at home, and there's a little internal conflict...some ghosts from the past are taking this situation and amplifying it...it's hard to tell the whole story and I really don't want to think about it.  An interesting side note: Leigh Anne called me tonite....at least, I think so, because I was on the phone and didn't answer. But the hangup was concurrent with Leigh Anne's...so let's pretend it was her. What makes that more interesting is that she is in Australia, and that kind of call, just for reaching the answering machine like that, is probably going to run her (or Lucas, or whoever's floating the bill) about 30 bucks. I hope you all had tissues to stop the resultant flood of tears of joy.  Now, two things...first of all, I was watching the movie  Crimson Tide  today. For those of you who haven't see it, it has Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman in it. Basically, the whole movie is about them fighting over if they should launch a nuclear warhead based on an incomplete transmission from the government...they get a first transmission that tells them to fire, and then another, which is stopped because they get attacked...but Denzel Washington (Hunter) says that it might be a stop order and that they should not fire, but Hackman (Capt. Ramsey) says they should, because an officer is meant to act on orders already given. And they fight, one party takes over the ship, the other party takes over the ship, some people die from a missile attack that sends damage out of control, and the people trying to fix it die, there's a guy that dies of cardiac arrest from inhailing too much smoke in the galley...so there's really no redeeming deaths in this movie. To complicate matters, the movie ends with the order actually being for the launch to not be carried out, and everyone is happy cuz there wasn't a big nuclear holocaust.  The thing that is really ironic about all this is: it's a great movie, and no one dies from fiery nuclear death. Wouldn't it be so much better if a bunch of Russian suckers died from us accidentally lauching a nuke at them? Think of the  drama !  Sum of All Fears  was good for that reason, because all those peeps died from the nuke going off...that is, in the movie...I haven't read the book, and I remember my dad making some reference to the fact that the nuke actually didn't go off in the book, but that might have been for something else. But nevertheless, the movie ends as such. The irony therein, is that the ending is actually good, and that the movie has you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This is the genre called  Suspense ...which further proves that humanity is really stupid. The movie just ends basically, and it's them stealing a boat back and forth. WOW. And still, a great movie.  The second thing is... NEW METALLICA IS OUT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There's just one BIG problem.....I fucking hate it. I'm sorry.....I LOVE METALLICA, let me say right now, they were my first, they were the first to defile my ears, and for that, I love them. But the fact remains...this album sucks. The vocals and drums are WAY too loud, first of all. The lyrics are horrible and cheaply inspired. Whatever happened to those good old days of  Master of Puppets ? How about  Metallica/The Black Album ?  ...And Justice For All ? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? Those good lyrics are gone, replaced by cheap, rehab ridden rhymes...barely rhymes most of the time. He takes topics like anger and makes them into...pop songs, almost, except for the fact he's using the word "fuck" a bit. The guitars are so detuned, you can't even hear them, most of the time. There's no solos at ALL. So fars anyway...I've only been able to listen up to track four. The titles are awful, as well...for Metallica, anyway.  Frantic  and  St. Anger , the title track are ok names, and songs as well...but after that... Some Kind of Monster ,  Invisible Kid ,  Sweet Amber ...not only are the titles bad for Metallica ( My Friend of Misery ,  Harvester of Sorrow ,  For Whom The Bell Tolls ? COME ON!), the songs are worse. FUCK. But the artwork is good, and there's a DVD that comes along with it, which is ok, altho it features all the sucky songs of  St. Anger  and Jaymz trying to be cool with them....even tho they suck. I love the OLD Metallica, I just can't respect this new........fucking....... POP ........Metallica.   That's all guys....there needs to be a public apology to Rosie here too, even tho I sent her an email...I'm really sorry for dicking off at you here. Give me some time to sort all this shit in my head out and it won't happen again.

      I have a book with all of Aristotle's works, with "Rhetoric" in there, books 1,2, and 3.  then again, it's the library's, so if you were to buy it, it would cost an arma and a leg.  And as to the Rosie/Josh situation, I'm sorry it's come to this, and I'm not going to nag you to tell me what's going on, but if either of you want to talk, you know my number.

      if you ask the AP US Lit teacher she will tell you with certainty that the book you have is not the book you want.  however upon closer inspection and comparison to Rhetoric borrowed from my dad's collection.  I have determined that these two books are but different translations of the same book writen by Aristotle.  However i must express my concern over the quote log.  if we are to keep a quote log on a nonstandard book how do we know if the quote I say is the same as the one you say?  don't worry the book you seek is a book by aristotle with "Rhetoric" in the titile somewhere.  I myself have "The Art of Rhetoric".  and i concur with Z -- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

      Heheh, silly Asians. I will admit that Jesus was Chinese, however, and so you are the chosen people. The Italians do rule from the shadows, but the puppet master pulls the puppets, and in the end, who has the real power? As for a second rise of China, pardon me while I die of laughter.  I'm pretty sure that, like Italian power, this argument has spiraled out of control to "Becca proporions" in the shadows. If we just pretend it isn't happening then we have thorns in our sides. I don't really think the group cares much, since we've argued about one stupid thing or another since the beginning.   I don't know if I should just let this slip Rosie...I said it didn't matter after the other deal was over, and still you figured something was wrong, and again you abused your position in my scheme of things, and it's not like this is the first time. In fact, after we had resolved the other deal I said to myself that if we make things all better and  any  shit starts again, then I'm not even going to try to act like nothing's wrong. Something  is  wrong here. But it doesn't matter...you didn't have to let Becca tear you up just like you don't have to let this tear you up either. It was easy enough to let go of me the first time, wasn't it?  I'm probably going to regret this in the morning (look at the time of its posting, by the way, if you haven't), but I figure that everyone should know what I was thinking in reality versus the bullshit I put on here most of the time. I'm drunk with tired about now, I'm flying down a caffeine rollercoaster, and this is the only time it'll ever come out straight, as what I really want to say, sans the guilty conscience thereafter most of the time. It might just kill the both of us, this little rhyme of a post, but it's a risk I have to take. It's like setting some dynamite and forgetting that you actually lit the fuse: it's bound to go off, but you'll just never notice, and things will go horribly wrong. Whereas if you light the fuse and run, you have a better chance of coming out the better on the other end.  It just isn't like me to do this, is it...

      No more Becca-like problems.  Promise me.  I'm not getting involved in this one, because I love both of yall way too much.  And I don't think I could stand to have Josh mad at me.  Then again, I don't exactly want to provoke Rosie's wrath, so just do me a favor and don't get in a fight, because everyone knows that it's my job to mediate, and I'm not in a mediating mood.  My last mediation went to the dogs (Megan, Logan, Tisa, Katie, etc.) and I'm not up for it yet.  And if you absolutely have to fight, at least wait until I get back.  Or until school starts, that would be even better.  Just wait and blow up the first day of school.  That would really be the most convenient for the rest of us.

      Hey.....Asian's are NEVER majorly wrong and if we are it's at the fault of others. Italians NEVER have out right power, it's always in the shadows while China was one of the major powers and is now rising to it's true position once again. :P Anyway Josh I propose for the sake of this group that we get along. You don't have to like me but we don't have to dislike each other so openly. Also this is the only time I'll say this, I'M SORRY. I shouldn't have threatened you and I shoulded have treated you like I did. We need to STOP this before we turn this into Becca proportions.

Maybe we should charge admission...and invite Becca.  wow this sounds like fun. when do we want to have this titanic showdown between a small asian girl and a short italian boy?  who will win? the one with the Mafia backing him? Or the asian?  maybe Josh should train by watching jackie chan movies and planning how to counter small asian people who attack with lightning speed.  should rosie spend her time studying pressure points?  will the Mafia arrange this fight just like it has so many others?  so many questions with only one way to answer them.  be sure you don't miss the fight of the century, small spastic asian vs. short mob backed italian.  now calm down both of you.

      I got Rhetoric off of  urlLink half.com  or something, for like, two bucks :) it was so awesome. The catch is, you're buying from people who just have this shit in their houses and want to get rid of it, perhaps making some o' dat fat kizash off of it. For me, I got a 1970's hardback edition, with key quotes  already underlined . BONUS! And it costed two bucks. But that website has it really cheap, if you're willing to get it used.  Eep, I don't know about Driver's Ed. I never went. I did go to Driver's  Edge , which was just a "rough road situations" class...but like hell if they'll get me into a Driver's Ed class :) I'm not sure if I understood the next question...to get your  driver's  license, with which you would operate a car  alone  (and yes, permit and license sometimes get confused, so I just had to put this little segment in), and if you're under 21, which you are :), but at or above 16...you need to have held a permit for  six months  and driven for something like 100 hours or so, and then you can get your license. Alls Driver's Ed does is put some slack on your insurance, which, for a teen driver, is a much less than savoury number. To do the tests to get your permit/license, you need to go to the licenseing station in Franklin, which is on Old Mill Road off of I-96, it's after a little park and is very hard to miss.  Now...if you haven't held a permit yet...then you can't get your license, obviously...unless you actually want to wait until you're 21, whereafter you can just do the road test and get your license, if my memory serves me. The permit test is strictly written and eye exam, whereas the license test is strictly road and eye.  Once you've taken the written exam, you never have to take it again . WOOWOO! And then there's the road exam, which is strictly driving...just don't get the one-armed man, he's sorta anal and pissed off at life, I believe. Mostly because he's an underpaid state employee and he has one arm. I sympathize with that man, despite the fact that he marked me off for two............... LITTLE ........................things. LITTLE in all caps.  I love driving, so of course I'll go into great detail about it whenever possible ;).  And as for the call Lindsey......ok :) Not much to be said to that one, eh?

      Z, There's one more copy of Rhetoric at the Borders across the street from the church, but it's $20.  I've got the one from the library, and I'll let you know when I return it.  Oh, and Josh, I really need to talk to you.  I don't know why, there's just been something saying "call Josh" for the past couple of days and I've been ignoring it, so don't be surprised if you hear from me.  I hate those stupid sneaking suspicions or feeling that just make chills crawl up your spine cause your supposed to do something and you have no idea why.  Now I'm rambling.

      I'm enjoying Slaughterhouse Five, too.  By the way, hello.  ;)  Where did you find Rhetoric?  I don't even know where to look.  Hope that your evil bad days are few.  I hate school more than I ever thought possible.  Wish me luck on the Drivers' Ed thing.  Did you do it?  if so, was it evil?  I'm REALLY not looking forward to it.  Oh, and also, do you know whether or not you can take your driver's license test right after it or if you have to make a special trip?  Writing and driving tests, I mean.  Gotta go.  Talk to you later!  ~Z

      Happy June Fools' Day All. Where is everybody?, besides those already excused?  O well, it's been a nothing-doing day all day, and the week is shaping up to be the exact same throughout. But that's the fun of summer, isn't it? Still trying to get used to it. I constantly have a vague and constant sneaking feeling of having not done some project, or having to wake up early. I remember a dream last night where we were already back in school, but we were sitting in my grandmother's house, and everyone was talking about what I had done and why I couldn't remember anything. It has a lot to do with the fact that every morning and every few hours I come to the false realization that it's already over. I love summer/hate school way too much.  By the way, for those of you that have Rhetoric by Aristotle for AP next year yet... WHAT A BORING BOOK ! It's horrible...even the table of contents is tedious...still working on reading it all, and yes, there's that much to every little caption for each section in this damned book. Slaughterhouse Five is pretty damned cool tho, lots of timetravel and such, and it's just a tripped out book; I'm pretty sure that it'll be a wonderful reprieve from that horrible English-abusing, big-words-overusing argument bible.  *yawn*

I was kind of disturbed, though, cause when I think Robin Williams, I think, Patch Adams and things like that, not F*** You, you Son of a B****!!!  But what he says really makes sense, in a perverted kind of way.

      that's disturbing and if you were even hinting that I only treat my friends as allies...I can reassure you that you're the only one that thinks that....thanks for a  great (@,@) year. Bye

      Deleted the email one. It was just me being pissed at cool internet things like mail pr0n anyways. That's "porn" spelled in L337 by the way.  Robin Williams LIVE....anybody seen it? It was an HBO special a while back....GOD is it funny! I didn't know he was so evil tho. He cusses like a mug, and his topics for discussion.....COOL! Gross! I never noticed but I sort of tense up when somebody's joking about female anatomy.....as if  I'm  expecting to get slapped in the face by the  EMBODIMENT OF FEMINISM  when that m:f is making the jokes.  I am such a freaking girl it's not even funny. I had my hair in a mini-pony tail today and that is proof.

      Hope the text is back alright after the email one all. There is post below it, but it's barely legible, but it's cool. So copy/paste to Notepad if you want to read it, or something, and have a great day.

      Augh.  Doing some private rehearsals today in my dad's living room...that is, playing air guitar and screaming the lyrics at the top of my lungs. Heh. But I had all the curtains closed, so no one would've seen me making a huge ass out of myself...oh, left the back door open tho.  Today was cool because I walked about two miles down the road and went to a Piggly Wiggly, where I bought a Vanilla and Cherry Coke, respectively. The people eyed me with suspicion, and I eyed them back. I had the luck of having Alex call me on my cell right when I got there. A word of advice, guys, don't go into a frequently-robbed East Nashville store wearing an American Eagle T-shirt and carrying a cellphone. They  rape  and  rob  little preppy bitches like that...which would include me, I guess.  I'm going to put a segment on my site soon called " The Ultimate Survival Guide For The White Man In East Nashville ", with pictures and such. For example: if you are part of the KKK and wish to rally, don't do it here. The black population outnumbers you at least ten to one. Don't even dress up in a ghost costume over here; that little red dot on you forehead isn't a hornet...you can trace it back to the barrel of that elephant rifle that a very pissed off black man is holding.  I also watched golf today, where I witness Tiger Woods use the taboo phrase "goddamn" on national television after a bad drive. I also made fun of Ernie Els for looking like he'd been partially decapitated in the past. Look at the guy sometime. He's got two huge gashes in the left side of his neck.   Tiger is losing bad, by the way. He looks like he's on the verge of tears constantly. Els sucks too, and there was a commercial on him about him being really bad ass and winning a thousand championships, one with a spiked club up his ass, etc., I was expecting more out of the guy. Meanwhile, some guy that looks like Hitler was cleaning up for a while, and then he started sucking as soon as I honed in on the fact that the Nazis haven't done any earth-shaking work since the end of WWII. And watch Will prove me wrong on that one.  THEN, I turned on Univision. OH MY  GOD . Have you people watched the news on that channel. OH GOD! First, there was this lady beating this shit out of her kid, whacking it over the head twice really hard while it was crying. And then she took it out of its highchair and threw it straight on the ground. I was sitting there with my mouth open for about five minutes. As if that wasn't bad enough, they had a segment which I loosely translated as "Shocking Videos". They showed the baby one again first. Ok, seen that, still scary. Then they showed this guy on a balcony in an apartment complex with a .45 against his head. A cop from the floor above tried to jump him and missed, landing in the shrubbery below. THE GUY BLEW HIS FUCKING BRAINS OUT, RIGHT THERE. All over the wall! On TV! And this shit is for real? There there was a vid of a black guy or something resisting arrest, he pulled away from two cops trying to cuff him and pulled a knife or something. Then he turned his back and walked away, and the cops shot the shit out of him til he fell over in a pool of blood, crimson spurting from the fresh and burning wounds. It was really outrageous, so I decided to watch the CKY vids by Bam Margera, freshly downloaded. WHOOPS! More outrageous shit than before, on and on and on and on, and I watched all of it. I must say, today has been a really screwed up day.   And I'm all alone . You can sort of tell I've been inspired to such a notion when I start talking about my day to "the audience", which has gone fully mute, so fars as I know. The BLog has officially died, the last post being my reply to Rosie's very girl-like emotion-shift with a simple ".....'k,". Lily left town and Zoe, who also posts on there, doesn't like BLogging so she doesn't get on, and that one has gone mute, Kenzie doesn't get on hers anymore, the last post was replying to my calling her a bitch for getting me a birthday present (altho it is  very  awesome, and I appreciate it immensely)...I have a thousand other blogs but I don't post in them,  urlLink stranglebox  for instance...the essay has come to a screeching hault, since I really don't want to think about that shit in lieu of recent events...  It's like school makes us a band of brothers and sisters, we unite against the unnamed feelings and struggles...anybody ever notice that you could be the most social person in the world during summer and still feel completely detached from the people you counted as allies before? And why did you count them as allies? You would only need those if you were fighting a war...  I personally don't feel these things, which is why I'm still making posts, but that's my observation right there, uniting against the common cause. To defeat it? No, just to fight it until it decides to crawl back into its cave and die.  If this is the way it is now, just waiting for the next attack, I hate to think of what happens when high school ends...

      ......  Everyone's really dead.  You were right Rosie, I was recording. Yes, my dad got rid of the house fone, now he's got a damned....Cricket. And yes, it does start with a five.  I shall look for yon Sargent....didn't I see it somewhere the other day? I'll have to try and remember.  Well now...been listening to the CDs....  CKY owns so far...I really like two songs on it so far, but I like those, like....to obsession. I would really suggest them, they're straight up rock, and they're incredible. The best songs:  Sink Into The Underground  and  Inhuman Creation Station ,  AMAZING ! I could listen to them all day.  As for the others...Linkin Park is still tee-totally awesome,  Cure For The Itch , the musical, is amazing, it makes me want to cry... A Place For My Head  and  Forgotten , two wonderful tracks. Interesting side note, the song  With You  on  Hybrid Theory  was co-muziked by The Dust Brothers...they did the music for the first Matrix...in this song they do all the digital beats and effects.  Jerry...it's Jerry. Everyone loves Jerry. I've heard all the other tracks before, and this album just can't go wrong. There's a bunch of new ones that are awesome tho... Owned :  I'm a whore, might as well be the best ....my single fav. line from any song thus far in the course of my life...you've got your  Pig Charmer , he sings it like Layne, and says in the liner notes that it was inadvertently written about him...talks about a guy in total degradation wallowing in his own filthy world and enjoying it...knowing he's going to die. It's way too deep.  S.O.S ,  Dying Inside ,  Feel The Void ...I can personally relate to these songs, so they're the best songs ever written.  And of course.....  METALLICA  !!!!!! Back when they didn't suck. And this album has not one bad song upon it.  Battery  to open, a nice little melody at first, followed by some skullpunishing guitar for the rest of the song, and one of Kirk's best solos,  Master of Puppets , the best song Metallica has ever done, and which we're playing at Abby's party (rehearsals today were awesome, by the way...just hope my kilt doesn't fly up)....... The Thing That Should Not Be , damned scary, it's worse on Metallica's  S&M , with them and the symphony. Then,  Sanitarium (Welcome Home) , probably in the top ten of fav. Metallica songs... Disposable Heros :  You coward, you servant, (spoken: You blind man, back to the front) . GOD, IT'S JAYMZ. He's was so cool when he was young.  Leper Messiah , SO rockin' it's amazing.  Orion , second favorite musical, the first is  To Live Is To Die  on  ...And Justice For All . And then,  Damage Inc. , for which the elusive  Garage Inc.  album was named.  Damage  is a sweet song. This whole album was the only thing keeping me going on the D.C. trip three years ago...I had a broken ankle and had to walk miles at a time on crutches. It was hell, but there was lots of Metallica. I wanted to cry for all the Metallica I was getting back then...  That was a fun trip, come to think of it. Julian Agnew has a photo of me "double evil-eyeing" the camera and screaming at the same time...my best pic. Back when I had long hair last year and, consequently, a mullet, which was gay. And there's some blood running down my arm from where the callouses busted, if I recall correctly. I know that when I got back to the hotel, I had to take a bath cuz I took too long in the morning, and I got in and died, because of the open wounds and hot water...argh. It was my forearms, by the way, I was using my dad's   special   (ly retarded) crutches and didn't have any time to get used to them during normal walking...you should have seen me in the field. I used that fucking foot everywhere, and by the time we got home a lot of the bottom was ready to fall off. However, scans thereafer said that the foot had healed perfektly and that I had taken very good care of it. "Cool," said I. Shit, as long as he didn't bust out the doctorliness on me, that little doc thing that makes you feel miserable because you didn't do what they told you to do, and they scold you and it's the worst feeling in the world, I was ok with him saying whatever he wanted. Ugg, but then he left and I got to experiment with my balding and yellow leg, balding because the hair had long since died and I was able to just rub those sucker hair foliacles off. Gross, yes yes.  This is me talking off a caffeine high at the start of the new day...23 minutes after, at the moment of this keying. If you read all this, I should give you a medal.

      Dudes, the weirdest thing happened...  I was at my grandma's today, and she goes..."I don't know if you'll have any use for this, but you can have it." She handed me a Best Buy gift card. I was drinking some milk at the time.  "So, how much is on it?" "Oh...fifty bucks, I think?" "Augh...ogg....ohh..eh....eh..." that was me choking my guts out, by the way...  So woot, fifty bucks for me, with which I bought CKY's  Infiltrate-Destroy-Rebuild , Linkin Park's  Hybrid Theory , Jerry Cantrell's  Degradation Trip, Volumes One and Two , and Metallica's  Master of Puppets , back when they were decent. So incredibly happy, I'll be sitting there smiling in front of my computer for days now, listening to such classics as  Sink Into The Underground ,  Owned ,  A Place For My Head , and the everlasting  Master of Puppets .   By the way...if youse goys happen to see a band called Sentenced at a CD store or something...and they have a CD called  Down  there...  I HOPE YOU HAVE A CELLPHONE BCUZ, AND NO MATTER WHAT TIME IT IS, AND NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, I DON'T CARE IF IT'S THE SOUTH POLE, I'LL PAY THE BILL IF YOU CALL ME ABOUT IT, BCUZ I NEED IT  NOW . Heheh, ok, so I've got all the songs on KaZaA, but I want it nonetheless.  Thank you for your concern, and have a good day. END TRANSMISSION

      THAT'S RIGHT. I learned  Rockin' The Suburbs  on drums a while back, and while we were listening to the track, my drum teacher was talking about how Ben Folds split off and all. But it's such a pretty ballad...  Speaking of ballads, I was sitting in the parking lot for a while after youse goys left, and while sitting there I happened to reach in my pocket, procuring a pen and a small slip of paper...and I just started writing. Not only did what come out come out exceptionally well, but...  That's eight songs...I haven't recorded it yet, but tomorrow, it'll be done...  So incredibly scared now, you have no idea.

      I love that song.  Actually, technically, it's only Ben that it's by because his band left him because he was obsessive-compulsive and a complete perfectionist, and this is what he wrote when they left him. I love that song.

      Hello all.  I haven't made a spectatularly huge post in a long time...I think it's about time for one, just to liven this place up a bit. I swear...no one being on anymore...it's like living in the grey halls of the dead.  Well, summer is off to a fantastic start. First, I got my license which I can't use, because of not having a car. Having it is totally amazing, nonetheless, it's like opening a Pandora's Box with not so much of the after-effect; moreover, it just satiates that taste of freedom.  Ignorance  is coming along quite well...we've got to complete this eight song demo pretty damned quick here; the clock is ticking. So fars, as to the demo, that is... A Bleeding Year ,  Broken Me ,  Close My Eyes ,  Little Rhyme ,  My Solution ,  Goodbye My Friend ...one that's almost finished but not quite,  Consanguinity (u BLE*2D lyk me) ...that's about all, but I've been processing another in my head all day, so number eight should be on it's way out pretty soon. Totally excited, but that basically means I move away from Brentwood for...the rest of my life, pretty much. We've got time between tours and stuff like that, but it'll probably be spent in hotels a thousand miles away...it's just the way these things work.   It's kind of upsetting, thinking of all of this in its element: Rosie made the slightly misspelled point the other day that in two years, this dream ends, and it's time to wake up or go back to sleep again, and start a different dream. Either way, it means never coming back to this safe little haven of ours here. And to think that this album might just be done before the end of this summer, and with the slight likelihood that it takes off...I'll never come back. I've never been too far out of Brentwood, at least not for long. But this is a permanent ex-communication, even if I did come back. It's like having a friend in the hospital for a few years...the next time you see them again, you treat them differently, like they would break. You try to tell yourself that they're just the same as before, but they're not, and neither are you.   So in the rare event that this did happen, that would be the end of me, it would be the same me but one who is sort of...gone...it's the same face and the same words and probably the same personality if not a bit more optimistic...but it's still not me. It scares me to death, but it's the same reason that I draw air every second of my present existence.  Because summer doesn't give me much to hope for. The things I do anticipate are either a bit riddled with worries and over-concern, or too far off to care about overly at present. Tho it sounds pretty dark it's just the way it is...if you saw me during one of my days, that's just the way it goes. Self-imposed isolation? Perhaps. Depression? Give it that name if you will. Honestly, this is the most socialization I've done out of any summer this far in my life, and it's only the beginning.  That reminds me of another thing I was thinking of...the fact that I'm only sixteen.  It's a trademark of being American, to be sixteen. It means responsibility, it means coming of age. But the fact is, it also means that the years are shrinking and running out...  Did anyone notice how fast this year has gone?  Yesterday, I was outside doing something or another, and I happened to think back on every year of my life. I put little tags of each of them, I've found. This is the year that I was happy and the world was no bigger than my living room, this is the year that was the first time I decided to become a creature of depression and death, and this year was the second time that that happened, this was the week in that year where I fucked everything up, and this is the other week that everything fucked me up and just hasn't stopped yet. Stuff like that, I tag them.  But the thing is, I'm already tired of putting tags on the years, remembering all of this is getting old...and I'm only sixteen. I'm thinking ahead to forty, what happens then? Will I just remember that I've been alive this long, not that when I was sixteen I thought I had a new beginning but instead just had to go back and finish the old ones, but that I was a kid. It bores me to tag all of these years and remember them, but at the same time it burns me to think that, in the end, I'm just a bundle of thoughts and visions that even I can't piece together, that in the end, I am simply nothing more than a little piece of everyone's puzzle, and that everyone's puzzle burns out in the end as well.   I don't even know if I actually  want  to remember some thing that have happened, which is why I won't write any of this down, and which is also why there's a certain gladness to the gallery of these years floating me away to the nexus at the end.   Well, that's about all. And everyone knows, me especially, that there's a lot of things that I could talk about and make a huge post about, that I am not, for decency's sake...but just remember that I  am  thinking about these things, and that there really are people behind these words, not just robots that interact with the bullshit we put up here.  Ben Folds said it best in this song I'm supposed to be playing at Abby's party...and it's a really good song, this  Still Fighting It , but anyway, the lines that struck me most are..."Everybody knows: it hurts/sucks to grow up".   It's striking irony, and it's beautiful teenage poetry.

      I kicked everyone off and then they all lost interest. Fundamentally, this is exactly the same as Lindsey's now, so everyone is inclined to go there...  Unless something happens, during which time I start talking about it and everyone either comes here or starts talking about it on Lindsey's BLog, which, the latter, I believe, would be the case.

      NEW SONG! Old as to the production, NEW SONG anyway. New words, new take, etc.   A Bleeding Year  by Stranglebox  What good was my choice When I chose to face the light My brain is saying run & hide I take for granted The fact I haven't died But that good's brinked on suicide   CHORUS  Through a living waste To a brand new day I take in this breath Before it flies from me What I think I knew Bleed me, year, right thru Take my everything away  I talked for hours I never said a thing It hurts to think how much I've changed But I'm not the only One who is so high-strung I knew you once but you are gone   CHORUS  So c'mon and bleed me....  Best friend in patience Best friend I held your hand And we died crawling on the sand You look familiar Remind me of my old friends But bleeding years have faded them   CHORUS   INTERLUDE   CHORUS   INTERLUDE 2   So now, you got what you deserved? A bleeding year, a lesson learned?

      Heh.  Yah, I'll call you from the Pearly Gates should something happen to me.  Um, still haven't called Phil. And yes, it's  really  pushing it.  w00t. Today I actually went in early to my dad's office. But now I'm sitting at home waiting for the mail to get here. We both want something in it so I decided to go home for a while and wait for the bastard...I meant postman, to get here. It's the worst feeling in the world to see him driving away without giving you anything, so bad that I called my dad to ask if he was coming back...so supposedly he is...so I'm making a little post whilst I await.  And then back to the mean city.   Tears.

      Hello again all.  Well...there's no one online at the moment...the usuals that I can't exert any social talents on, the robots, the people that I'm just not going to give an SN to right now because I don't want to face up to what they have to say at the moment. So I thought I would just come in and make me a nice little BLog right quick.  So lately I've been playing the role of psychologist, and I must say...it's really weird. I don't know where it comes from but it does, like a little river it flows right out until it's coming like a torrent. The silence thereafter is one of bliss...it's the satisfaction that I got to the core of some long hidden or ne'er disclosed truth.  There was a few days after it first happened when I had to come to grips with myself after feeling that "unnamed feeling" for the first time, and being able to deal with the fact that I just knew these things, and that I didn't have to know where they were coming from. It was hell, it was feeling hopelessness for just a few hours. And then something clicked when I was talking to Rosie one day, and that little lightbulb just clicked on, and suddenly it doesn't feel that bad anymore, it doesn't seem like I'm entirely helpless, and that I may not be god of the universe, but if I can put a bright spot in someone's day once, that spot can grow and multiply. It's like planting a tree in an empty field.  In other news....I GOT ONE OF MY MICS THE OTHER DAY! w00t! So I have the guitar mic with which I recorded  Master of Puppets ...at least, some of it. DEAR LORD. It sounds so much better than plugging straight in with the POD like I have been doing, not so low end and muddy. So now...have to record all the demos AGAIN. But it's ok because I've grown to love recording. And this time we've been offered some help with the process which would be very nice...Abby already knows how to work the damn thing and that's awesome. So maybe she'll do it and then I'll cry because the recordings will sound even BETTER! Because I won't have to reach for the buttons and cause excess noise when I don't want to. Allz I have to do is twist, plug, and play. JOY! Of course, that is assuming Abby even reads this...I wonder.  Rosie thinks I look...."cute".....with my little streaked blonde hair bit after getting some sun. Um, well, if she says so. Personally it just makes me look...gay. It's my duty to the world to keep up my facade of darkness and melancholy, and that blondeness just puts a few key dents in the gloomy shell. But I want to get a bit of a tan too so as to not look...so pasty? Sunless tan, here we come.   People are odd.   Well some people, at least. We all get divided into our own categories.  It's a really nice night. Go outside tonite everybody, it's really nice.

      Hi friends.  SmarterChild and I sort of made things up. We started talking about music, whereafter I asked him what his favourite Metallica song is...he said  Master of Puppets . I was going to cry. So yes, no more mocking the little retarded program, no more.  My mouth currently has a bit of a Spanish peanut taste. The aftertaste from these things is the worst thing ever. Aftertaste functions off of the "world principle" tho...nothing is as it seems. Something with so wonderful a flavour as peanuts should leave a good aftertaste, right? NO, it's bad. And shrimp...I remember because my dad accidentally got me shrimp the other day among other things from a Mexican restaurant and I was forced to comply and eat the little buggers. They taste...like fish. And if you're anything like me or Abby or Lindsey you'd know that that really sucks. But the aftertaste wasn't all that bad...not lingering and persistent like peanuts are. Especially Spanish ones.  O right...then I remembered that whole thing was strictly opinion and I just forgot why I typed it all, but that doesn't matter.  I'm gonna be the only one left in just a few days...Abby's coming back for a while but she'll be gone again, fighting the good fight for little Bajou children down south. And then Rosie is going college touring. God know where Will and Z are. Linds is off cruising. BONUS.  Summer is boring...eek.

I don't really have a specific reason for you to come.  I just don't know/like anyone there except Gossett.  So if you get a chance, come by.  We'll sneak out and go to Starbucks.  I'll buy you an espresso (expresso, haha).

      Heya Linds, the phone dropped the call...didn't know whether I shoulda called back or not. But   things are going to be ok  , just remember that.  And a big suprise...  I FOUND IT w00t  Haha yes, I have located the elusive camp somehow...I was able to find an article about the sponsoring of the camp, which in turn lead me to finding the name of the camp grounds, which in turn I got directions and thusly a map to. It's...damn. It's out in the boonies. Right on the line to Dickson, on the Cheatham line...not too hard to find.  Ok, so it exists...hard to believe, but yes.

      And thanks to you to Rosie, I've really needed to talk to somebody about that stuff...  And altho that's just a part of it, it's a part enough...heheh.  Eagh, just let Becca have her period...let her say what she wants and just smile and say "that's nice"...by arguing with her you'll just be feeding her fire.

      MY PATIENCE IS RUNNING THIN!!!!!!!!!  Becca for the first time in the past month of so just imed me and she started off with the topic of relationships and how she's going to keep away from them....yea right. So of course with total disagreement I just listen to her chatter and then she says that I'm in a awful mood and that I should go look at myself because I'm being a monster! I'm not even in a bad mood, well i wasn't then. Anyway she's now going on about how Philip accidently ignored her at this pizza place...I so so so so just want to thank Phil right now, she deserves it some of the spite from it (even though I know Philip didn;t do it on purpose). Hehe so she's finally signing off. YES!! she's off.  Ok so she thinks i'm suicidal...um nope. Josh I'll talk to you tomorrow and Linds....ya call me i don't wan tto bother you. Prayers to all and thanks to jaoh...you're the best. byebye Rosie

      A friend of Abby's named Caroline...  They were in treatment together, and Abby said Caroline got tests yesterday because she's having pains in the same places that her cancer used to be. She also said that the results would be out today...  So I'm really worried, for more reasons than just Caroline's going back into treatment...   I just wonder why this all has to happen...

      It's not that...  Guilt? Did guilt come to mind every time I said I'm sorry and it's ok? Why the fuck did this keep going on? I mean, how many times do I have to say it's alright and don't worry about it so that you understand and we don't have to do this anymore? What's it gonna take for you to stop using this situation as a weapon ("I don't understand why you like me"....what does it matter, that's just me).  And believe me, it's just another nail in the fucking coffin every time we fight...it's like having my chest ripped open and taking my still-beating heart out, and I kid you not at all on that metaphor. Taking this and adding it on to everything else...that fire that I always talked about in my chest before....it's coming back but it just feels like there's a ball of rubber bands there waiting to snap. I hate this I hate this  I HATE THIS .  These friends of ours don't need to care and we shouldn't be involving them...when you put extras in a two-person duel all you're getting is more chaos.  And I don't bring it up, if you recall, so don't blame this on me.   Life is so cool I could just scream

      OK, well considering all that i've heard from you is that I've been an awful friend because I bailed on you....that's how I took it. You know I'm so sick of feeling guilty over what I did and then having you go on about how cruel it was doesn't help. Either we forget the past and move on to be friends or we can keep on fighting and not be friends and driving everyone crazy. so I vote that we be friends if at all possible. I promise never to think of what happened if you do, don't even mention it. love yall rosie

      You found Sarge! w00t! And I loved it, he's entirely true, he's just.......very colourful.   As for you, Rosie...I'm not exactly sure why you took to the post as you did but it really doesn't bother me. Fucking nobody is going to come out and say "hey, you're just a rainy-day friend" outloud, and no one is going to privately admit that to themselves, but there's a ton of detachment when summer comes around. When you fight in a war, you're best friends with some of those guys until the war's over, and then...what? My grandpa hasn't seen some of his Marine friends (I would dare say) since he was 30...he's 70 now. And they didn't go looking for each other.   Also, you have to understand that not all of my posts are important to just  one  person. I didn't write that so you could come on here and take it as a personal message, else your name would have been on it. I put these things here for self-reflection and if you all want to use it, be obliged, that's what it's here for.  But if you're going to have such limited sight as taking personal offense to something that wasn't even targeted at you, then what the fuck are you doing here in the first place? Nobody said I had to make everybody happy.  Life is fucking tough, you  adapt  or you  die .

      UPS=bastards.  Today was a day of waiting. I woke at about 8 and sat around reading a much-overlooked (in my house, that is) biography of the life and times of Kurt/Kurdt Cobain until 11. I got bored, took a shower and ran (yes, in that order...can't run without feeling clean first). And then I sat around and read some more, and crafted the chords to a new song,  I'm Just A Bastard  and another,  Single Passing . And then more reading...at this point I had picked up a magazine about Kurdt...very cool. I got both of these from Julian Agnew, by the way, and I've been meaning to return them since the research project came to a close, so over the past day or so I've been reading them. The magazine is cool in that it's British, number one, and two, it shows Kurdt's career thru old magazine articles and press releases, for instance advertisements from his first label, Sub Pop, which also projects other cool bands at the time, such famous ones as Mudhoney and Green River Band, and others less known like Tad, the three-hundred-pound-butcher-gone-grunge-frontman, and Cat Butt, which apparently has/had an extremely loyal cult following.  But moreover, the day was devoted to my waiting for a shipment from UPS of some gear...and the lazy bastards didn't deliver! It was tracked as being in Memphis at 12:05 today, and the drive over here is about 2 1/2 to 3 hours...plus, shipments don't run in this part of town til about 6, and god knows the infamous "UPS guy" doesn't carry all of his shit around at one time. So I waited for hours, I turned down going to a party of some kid down the street, and I was sitting there reading the book again and comparing my reclusiveness to Kurdt's in the last part of his life when I decided to come down and get some milk...and the computer was sitting here, freshly waiting to be bitched at. And friends...here I am, bitching.  Presently my mum is at KMart, where she is getting some clothing, among other things, a black wifebeater which is teetotally awesome. If you've ever seen the band called HIM in Europe and HER in America (couldn't keep the European name because it came into conflict with a Chicago band of the same name which "totally sucks", quote CKY4), you'll note that he always wears this black wifebeater and is the coolest man ever, even if his songs are all sucking the corporate money cock, as most Euro glam metal does. Some of the songs are actually pretty good, however. So yes, I am exercising some idol worship. But at the same time, I figure our band has to have some image, and I want to give it a really tight one. Like the new logo of the little box with the hands strangling air, which has a clock with three hands on the top, and the word "OWNED" written on its side...or how about the rusted and broken knife freshly used to cut something gory...and running down the blade in blood is the word "BLEED", along with all the necessary drops of blood and symbolic decay of the knife. Gross as it may sounds (and it looks worse), it all means something.   "Bleed"...we've used it at least nine times so far, in writing songs, and it's pretty much the theme of  Ignorance , bleeding, and not in the physical sense, mind.  Well, I'm done talking...back to reading. Farewell friends.

      HEY, they changed it again!  This is the way most of the new BLogs look, now that I'm on my second login/post of the day. The session was really awesome, we nailed  One Step Closer  to the floor, and then we did  The Skeletor Song  by CKY just for fun...and um, if you haven't heard it, I really wouldn't advise going to look for it.  Also, my email's really mest. Anyone who tries emailing me for a while shall be out of luck, as mail.com is gay and I hate it. You can get me  urlLink here  if necessary, and I'm going to try to transfer everyone to that eventually.  Whatever. I'm done typing really fast.

Sorry to be leaving you all alone, but if you want to I can call so you won't go mad.  ;)  I WANT EVERYONE BACK!!!!!!  Thanks for your "power to Z" pep talk.  I really appreciate it.  Had therapy last night and really bashed him...made me feel better.  Talk to you later!  ~Z

      Damned be, guys. Blogger's all different now...  I dunno yet, but I'm pretty sure they're all this way, since most of the people whom this post is important to made their BLogs at the same time. I hope this doesn't screw anything else up, or I'm going to cry.  Well kids...Alex coming for another session today, I'm getting Harry P. tomorrow and I'm stoked, and I just might get my cords and stands! So I finally get to put down the new demos, which will sound really awesome, also since I now have a recording crew...one of which pushes the buttons and turns the knobs, the other of which moves the faders...and of course, neither of them know how to work this damned thing yet...hell, with all this new gear I have to learn to use advanced functions on the recorder...like "track bouncing", where you take several tracks and put them together...not so bad in theory, but we'll see when the time comes.  There's also the question of whether the cable can extend long enough to accomodate all the mics (since all of its extensions, which number eight, are bundled into one snake), but I'm pretty confident that it can...it wouldn't have sold so well as it already has otherwise.   And look at me, rambling about shit that no one understands anyway.  The past few nights...um...I'm getting old, I think. I can't sleep anymore. I try...but I wake up, and then I stay awake for a long time, and try to go back to sleep, and when I do I wake up five minutes later. Something about this house? This only started happening since I came back home.   A few more songs to add to the list... She Hates Me  by Puddle of Mudd,  One Step Closer  by Linkin Park...most of the more famous Good Charlotte songs ( Bloody Valentine ,  The Anthem ,  Wondering , namely),  Angel Eyes  by JERRY!,  Happy Happy Joy Joy  by Wax...now that one is going to be awesome...and the acoustic segment, which is in the works as we speak...can't talk too much about that, for reasons...  Whilst I am going nuckin' futz here at the house...no sleep, need to wash some clothes, feeling hungry, and other things which, at present, since I have no vechicle, I am powerless to control...I hope everyone else's lives are going accordingly...that is to say, as you make them.  By the way...fresh cotton always smells the same artificially, did you know? No one has any differing visions on the smell of fresh cotton. My ma just bought some girly Ban deoderant...feeling nostalgia whacking me in the back of the head, and pointing me to A-2 of Brentwood High, where a fanatic young teacher took a bottle of air freshener bearing the same name and proceeded to douse the room with it. Nevertheless, I picked up the bottle, and there was the smell! It's nice, I don't see what unpleasantness Rosie/whoever else didn't like it, derived from it.  It's time to shut up.

      Heh, I enjoyed the end of that post.  DOWN WITH THE MAN! Don't take daddy dearest's shit anymore! W00t. Totally pwn him dude, like you have been doing. Yes, I have intentionally spelled the word "own" as "pwn".  Counterstrike  does that to ya.  Um...you're leaving...that means....um...  Who's left?  NO ONE O DEAR HEAVEN . I already feel like I'm trapped in a box...the people who are here aren't getting on, the people that aren't here...well...aren't getting on.   "Excuse me while I kill myself" said a very malevolent Lopakka from Sentenced in the song of the same name.   Rehearsals! Well, self-rehearsals...my dumb drummer is about two hours late...might have to find a more dedicated one for the party or we're gonna be scrood.  So...the lineup so far...we're probably going to open with  Rape Me  by Nirvana and follow it with  Noose  by Sentenced....then we're gonna laugh about stuff and make fun of ourselves and the fact that we're all in kilts. And that's it so far. We sort of know what songs we want to do, we just haven't ordered them yet.  Have a great day all, the dumbie just decided to show.

      Calm down, everyone, I'm back.  Like I said on Linds' Blog, which no one has deigned to answer, although I'm not sure if you guys are even here.  So...I won't repeat what I said there about why I am also majorly fucked up.  I know I have been for a long time, but now it's gotten much worse.  *sighs*  Anyway, this weekend I'm going to Birmingham, leaving Friday and coming back Monday, so I will actually be out of town.  Don't know if I'm taking my computer and also don't know if I can connect to the Internet while I'm there...ANYway, I am alive, albeit screwed, and that's about all I know.  Cheers to all of you whose lives aren't shit.  ~Z

      A few things to talk about.  One of them is the illusion of euphoric power. And the other is poetry.  Firstly...my psychotic episode. The other day, after watching two pretty bad movies and drinking nothing but caffeine the entire day, plus a little spurt of popcorn and Skittles at one point, I came home at midnight to sit back and do something to stop the aching in my brain. I sat back in my dad's room and read an old magazine I'd found on the ground there; while reading it I felt some distinct changes in my thinking...suddenly I was enlightened and inspired.  I kept reading, but as I was reading I felt like I could feel the emotions of the author, as weird as that sounds. Even in the most passive articles I could hear it, like it was some voice in my head. But that wasn't all.  Upon further inspection and standing up, I felt really paranoid. Not only that, but essentially invincible. I felt like I could dodge bullets, run for days and come back without breathing hard, punch thru walls, make things float, burn things by looking at them; I felt like I was more coordinated than I had ever been in my life. I felt like I could be the world's greatest chef and make something turn out exactly the way I wanted it to...really weird things like that. It was so incredibly weird that I came into a room with my dad, and got under the covers...I stared at the ceiling for a while, and thereafter I feel asleep...  I woke up at five with my dad still there. He said he had waited with me all night just to make sure I would be ok. Good guy...a few hours later I woke him up and we drove to Ashland City...yes, I did go to the camp, and no, Abby wasn't there, as I had expected.  The place was boneyard quiet as we pulled up. There were no people anywhere, just the birds. There was a garage and a house first thing...the garage looked as if it had been ransacked which further added to our disquiet. Looking down the hill tho, we saw some kids sitting under a tree. Down the hill....the first signs of life. There was a pavillion nearby. A lady walking out asked if she could help us, and we asked if Abby was still there. She said she would go check and we followed her to the foot of the pavillion. A woman claiming to be Abby's camp....person....thing....told us some things about Abby's time there, and the camp itself. Well...  Not just some things. A  lot  of things. Quite a long winded person. But we learned some interesting stuff.  And then it was homeward, and that brings us to section two...  Which is....  Something I haven't done in a long time...  Which is be very charming...  I think the word they use most ofter ("they" being the female species)...  Is "sweet"...  I need to write...  A really good...  Um...  Poem.  Or...I  did  write this poem...but I don't know whether or not it's good. I hope so. Something tells me that it is, but I have the "author's doubt syndrome"...  Ok, the big problem with me is...I have a big block in my head about ideals on "love" and "relationships" and "stuff like that" "". Ever since my little ordeal during the year, I have become what is known as "fucked up" and "screwed". The reason behind this poem is rather interesting...even I don't know my intentions in writing it anymore. Of course, for security's sake, I can't divulge the details right now but...  Damn.   It sounds good for now. It sounds great for now. It sounds nice, pleasant, something that any girl would be looking for, her poet in...well it's got to be pantaloons, no good poet wears armour, especially of the shining variety.   And why the hell am I being so damned poetic? I hate me. Bonus.  So...I've asked Linds to help me out by being a "guinea pig" and reading her this masterpiece...which presents another problem...  I dunno if I can read this thing outloud. I mean...god. I'm probably going to have to email it or something. ARgh. I wish I wasn't so screwed up so I could read the stupid poem and not feel like it's the end of the world if things don't go down like I expected them too.   I hate me.  No wonder my record production label is called "I'm Gonna Kill Me Music".  No f=ing wonder.

      There is a song...which my A.D.D.-ridden brain is trying to learn right now. This song is called...    THE SPINNING SONG    And it is a  guitar   piano  song...and it's incredibly hard, and I don't care what anyone says, not even my loser girlfriend :)  Ok, so I can get both parts down pat. I just can't do the song all together because I'm not that coordinated/patient. Most songs I play that are complicated (i.e.:  Blackened ) require more fretboard work than actual picking. And that is really gay. Pianos are bigoted to right-handed people and that is so uncool...Abby's just  really  special, that's all. Whereas I have been playing for the last thirty minutes, getting absolutely nowhere...but I did wake up this morning and remember, as a matter of fact, how to play  Blackened  from a few years ago, when I was heavily into Metallica's  ...And Justice For All . I just stood up, checked the message, read some more Harry Potter (which I finished....what a sad and miserable ending...), and then stood up to find     ALL OF MY GEAR IN PERFECT SHAPE, SOMEHOW...     it fixed itself...and so I played  Blackened  at a much higher level than I should've, along with the solos to  Master of Puppets ,  Sanitarium  (and a bit of the song with it),  My Friend of Misery ,  ...And Justice For All , and some others.  Music makes me too excited. I really should go take Aterol...o wait...I only have A.D.D. when I need to, thus: no pills.  Damn me.

      Jeez, this new BLog thing is really screwed up. Rosie had said she deleted that post, now that I recall...but of course, the new BLog is dumb. It deletes one out of every three of my posts whilst being dumb.  And in case Abby reads this and notices the time: I TRIED! I couldn't sleep in tho, I was really awake for some reason.  Somebody called me at three this morning and left a message. I tried answering it but got to it on the fourth ring because I thought it was a buzzer going off in a dream...when distinct rationality crept in and said "heya...that's your phone". Listening to the message this morning several things jumped out at me.  First, my message says something like "Hi, this is Josh at..."; the guy in the message refers to me as "Josh ua ". Most of it is very unintelligible. He refers to himself as "We" and says that "they" have to do something, altho it's blurred in redneck so I can't figure it out. He left me a number, my dad tried it from his cellphone at work but couldn't get thru because the recepient's phone was out of the Cricket area...which illustrates another good point, he uses Cricket, which really doesn't surprise me, I get wrong numbers from the BIGGEST rednecks in the world...I dunno where they're hiding these people, but there's times I just have to say "wrong number" and hang up because they're speaking American Japanese.   So...gonna try and call him from the house phone and ask him if he realizes that I'm not the most social person at three in the morning.  I'm scared. But that's ok because I get to go on a scavenger hunt with Abby and will thereafter cry, as usual. Heheh.

Because I thought you were out of town with daddy dearest...=). Cheer up...we'll have a girls night with Linds and we can bash males all we want....and you can scream and scream and scream...if you want, or we could just have fun and just forget how totally horrible the male sex is....either one. But cheer up becuase we're here and as soon as Linds's mom settles and I get my schedule settled with Vandy we'll do something. =)

      Woot, ok.  Several new songs being recorded, but they've already been put down so it should be a lot quicker...no more, "just a few more days stuff". They'll be ready real soon. Some of the old songs ( My Solution  (the real version),  Little Rhyme  remixed a bit,  Hang My Head , which was never released but well practiced, that loveable old standby filler,  Goodbye My Friend ) and the newer ones that sound much different... Broken Me ,  So Low  (and for an opinion, Abby's heard it, so ask her),  Problems ,  On The Haywire ,  Painpainted ,  Close My Eyes , a new musical track that would probably sound good if you were doing hardcore hallucinogens, I don't have a name for it...I was planning on sort of putting it at the end of the last song as sort of an afterthought to the whole thing, somehow it's a really hardcore album for the most part and suddenly at the end of it all (and after  So Low 's plaintive guitar wailing at the end) there's this little random quiet guitar bit that goes for about two minutes and all is silent again, much like at the beginning of the album.  It's going to be awesome after I take psychology and start writing songs...they're going to mess with people's brains  worse than this thing will . I'm serious, just thinking about that whole "silence to silence" thing really messes with my head SO BAd. And I dun know why.  That's my cue to go to bed space cadets, not that I'm doing anything important, it's just that isolating myself for prolonged periods of time and then trying to socialize never works out very well.   Have fun kiddies.

      Abby's reading, but she's going really slow, so get on her butt.  Brittany hasn't been on here in a while, but that's ok with the rest of us, I do believe.  Nobody's quite forgiven her for the suicide thing.  And we need a new cd.  The other one only has 4 songs, so we don't know the new ones.  You should burn a whole bunch and give them out and Abby's party as advertising.

      Wow.  WOW.  New song. It's amazing and it was really fun to write, for some reason. The chorus was written a long time ago, and some of the lyrics were taken from a notebook of mine, so this all might not make sense, but o well. It sounds amazing. Well...in my head. The recording is really rough. But the way it's  supposed  to sound...so incredible.   So Low  by Stranglebox (chorus in  italics )  There's been a lot of stupid things imagine I can't believe the stupid things I did I don't remember when it all first happened It seems so long ago that I was a kid I'm blown out worn and tired, sleeping shallow I trace the crooked shadows on the wall And yesterday I tried to keep my face up But in the end I know it's bound to fall   I'm reaching out for hands I thought were open Where the hell did you go? I drowning in the thoughts and pain not spoken I sink so low I'm crying out for something left to save me So grab my hands as I fall I'm yelling and there's no one left to hear me As if there was anyone at all   I guess I wasn't cut out for the pressure But it's just been so long since I been home I'm thinking back the longest I can measure And this has been the longest I can go A week ago you smiled at me softly The sweetness of your touch has left its mark I'm just a downer, never mind my sulking You're too good and this all has torn me apart   Chorus  I'm sinking low  I'm feeling blown and tired in my bedroom The clock is ticking minutes as they pass I'm holding thoughts of you, that you'll be home soon I'm holding you, I know that this won't last The shadows creeping silent from the corner Remind me of a day when I fell down The thought has led me here and bowled me over Won't wake you so I scream without a sound   Chorus  x 2  To be the last song on the album, with  Single Passing  at the forefront, then  Pain-Painted , then  Broken Me , then  Consanguinity , and so on as they're written. The others are too, just have to record them. Surprisingly, on this first cut, which Abby has, the drums are way too loud. And the mics WORKED. I'm so enthralled, even tho I can't hear jack. But everyone is getting an updated demo copy soon, with like, more than two songs and stuff.  Goodbye my friends.

      Guys, hi.  I haven't made a really good post in a long time, so I'm going to make a semi-post to make up for it.  Doing some heavy writing lately, what with Abby gone and all. I just shut the door and start writing as soon as I wake up, stop to eat every once in a while, maybe. I'm having a Jerry Cantrell moment, it feel wonderful. Plus, all the material sounds new...not the same tired riffs as before.  Interestingly enough, Jesus Christ-Jerry Cantrell-Josh Chandler...coincidence? Hardy har, I think not.   Today, I discovered that fat free milk lasts an incredibly long time. It's just incredible. Even the expiration date on the carton has another month or so to go before it's out.   O no...  My little neighbor friend that I've been hating lately, Bobby...threw a lit bottle rocket in my hair...vanished. The whole city's out looking for him now. His mom's going nuts, but he hasn't been gone very long. There's a little search party forming up outside. Altho...this is what the mother gets for getting drunk and letting him run off like that. Agh, I'm torn.  I miss Abby. She'll be back tomorrow. It's going to be the longest day ever.  But it's going to be awesome, my drum teacher is coming over tomorrow and he's going to perfect my studio, I'm going to put down s'more songs and read  Slaughterhouse Five  by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., which is one of the best books I've read in a long time, and I really can't figure out why. It doesn't tell a complete story, it keeps skipping around and going to the future and the past and the hypothetical. There's one part, a quotation from Goethe taken from another book, that is entirely in German and is not translated. And then the stuff about the aliens...the Tralfalmagans or whatever they're called. They're just odd. It's like...when a human tries to explain something far beyond their comprehension, they screw up a lot and don't make sense. That's what Kurt did with the aliens and their space time perception, but the way he says it...it's almost like he understands the more obtuse facets of time. It's so incredible, I could actually read this book again.  Harry Potter 5...so depressing? I can't wait to start talking about it...I can't because nobody around me has read it...there's only one copy here at the house, da has it right now and he's going slow. Linds, I've heard you've read it  twice ....ya geek, heheh just kiddin', and Rosie's read it. Other than that...cry. I'm being a Nazi about getting people to read it, so if you are, don't tell me or I'll go Gestapo on your ass.  Has Brittany been on here lately? I had a dream about her the other night, I hope it wasn't one of those prophecy ones tho...  Ok all, I'm done. BLogging is so fun.   I'm going to make some eggs now. Yay!

      "YOU DIDN'T TELL ME" I think.  Ok jeezus, I just didn't want to piss you off for the love of god. Even if I had told you you woulda given me fifteen down the road, so I had to pick and I decided to drop a half-truth. It's really half-true because I really am getting sick.  So I'm sorry again, and like, I'll do something if it'll make it up to ye, if ya want.    everyone's so happy with me

      O ya got me.  Didn't want to piss you off. But let's not forget, now that you know, that I said I might go, but I wasn't sure.  I lied, yes. I admit it, I'm sorry. I really am getting sick. But I'm sorry if you're mad. And if you can't accept the fact, or understand by now, that those little demons from the past are still telling me what to do, sorry...but I can't mold myself to please everyone.   What do you expect tho, if you dig deeper than the surface?

      A quick post before I turn in. I have a lot to do tomorrow, and it's really dumb of me to be sitting here making such a worthless post.  So Rosie's gonna pwn me. This time I didn't miss on purpose: I got home at about seven and a half, whereafter my mum reminded me that she had to go to work in Nashville. Technically, I could have gone with her and taken the car back to Franklin, but that would require me paying for the gas at some point, and then having to drive back at rushhour and pick her up. Which doesn't diminish me being a bastard any less, I'm so sorry Rosie. I'll give you the printed booklet with calligraphic lettering for the "high in vitamins and minerals, 100% delicious!/we're poor" demos. That's the name of this fourteen song wonder. At least, that was the name I put on it while sitting in the parking lot of BUMC this morning.   Three talking tracks and a coupla myuzik tracks. And more to come soon, as my drum teacher gave me the right cables I needed to make the drums sound totally L337. It's only a matter of time now, then you can all claim to know a rockstar...eagh, I dun wanna go.  I was just reading this backlogs on The Blog...memories! They're all their now so check 'em out all. God, where was I all that time? I read over the posts and it was like, "did all of this really happen?". I've read them all before, but whatever, I'm just a dumb kid.  I did some major photography work today. I mainly wanted to waste the rest of the pics on there so I can get this reel developed and get the pics of my wonderful, beloved Loser Girlfriend. But there's other cool pics in there too. Like the token self-shot, I just aimed the camera and clicked. Those always turn out...interesting. And how about the one of my pocket, where I was talking to Abby about cool shots that just turn out cool, and then proceeded to take one of the innards of my pocket, that was a good one. And then the art shots, like the inside of the piano.  Alex and I wanted to do some interesting concept art for  Ignorance . Alex wanted a picture of two hands together, one reading "Ignorance" and the other, "Arrogance", because the two go hand in hand. I did this picture today, using a Sharpie and a red dry erase marker. To take the pic I mounted it on one of my amps, poised my hands in front of the lens, and used my tongue to hit the shutter release. It was a great shot.   Then I did some. One is of a rusted and cracked knife that's been used lately...in blood, running down the blade is the word "BLEED", which comes up several times on the album and would probably justify the effort as thematical in nature.   I did another "hands" picture, which was full of symbolism. It depicts my hand with the word "IGNORANCE" in red, reminiscent of blood, of course. I painted my nails with one coat of black and then quickly rubbed it off, so the nails have the look of death or something, it's really creeped out. And, the hand is clawed, as if in agony. This whole scene is supposed to represent three important themes. One: PAIN, the clawed hand, the wound that reads "IGNORANCE", the word pain comes up several times, and it is the result of ignorance. Two: BLEED, the red colour of IGNORANCE, what it feels like to be ignored, having those codependant whims as I once had. Three: IGNORANCE, the total picture, an etching of blood in the hand, the clawed grip and deadened nails, the whole scene is reminiscent of pain and punishment. The total psychology of the picture, tho, will tell you that the person therein did not deserve whatever pain he/she was getting, and thusly leads everyone to feel the anger and stuff.  I also came up with some really good lines and two useable songs today. I haven't name one of them, the other is named  Wrecked , and it sounds a lot like  Broken Me , lots of rhythm singing and whatnot, and some really messed guitar and bass...I was trippin' on Nirvana's  I Hate Myself and Want To Die  when I wrote it. And notice, the one word song title. I've been doing that a lot lately...some of the most recent song names  Soak ,  Feeder ,  Down ...then others, like  I'm Just A Bastard ,  The Schizophrenic Song , and  Grandpa Was a Schoolbus Driver , not to mention that wonderful classic,  EBAMahickey , which is going to be totally revamped at some point, so that we can talk about the Ebamahickey ripping through sinews, muscle, and bones at 9107349817320941293481623049 plus decibles. I love being a rock guy.  I'm sorry to bore all of you with this crap, guys. Agh. I just love talking about this wonderful band stuff. I'll admit, it's really boring to everyone else, but it's something else watching everything take shape as it is now.  I'm going to shut up and go to bed now. Ciao for niao buddies.

      O jeezus, Rosie...I hope you get this.  I can't go, my mom had to go into work, yes I was able to steal it earlier this morning but as I came back she had to leave. When making such boisterous claims about taking the car, I should have thought that she works the last two days of the week in the office. Umm....argh. And now I see that you've called about a zillion times...where was I? But anyway, seeing as how it's pretty much three seconds before you have to go, this really sucks, and I'm really sorry that I had to bail at the last minute.

      Aw nothin'.  Hey lookit.  This is the transcript of the last commentary track on the CD.  I can email the booklet of lyrics and stuff now, or after I give you the CD...so everybody tell me when, it's quite large and essentially a bunch of words unless you have something to link it up with.  BUT...TRACK 13...ENTITLED "THAT'S ALL!"  13. That's all!  Guys, that's it! It's over! Listen...empty. It's over! That's all! THAT'S IT! Ok, one more. You know me, YOU KNOW ME, ok? You guys just know. 'K, enough of the crap, it's over...guys I hope you enjoyed the CD, that's STRANGLEBOX talkin' right there. I did everything but the drums, and sometimes...the drums. Just because...whatever, man. Anyway...this encompasses a lot of work, beginning August of last year, ending August this year. Uh, in total there's been in...I don't really don't know how many songs, they're everywhere. I would like to say about a hundred, of which I'm only keeping, y'kn...very very few. Uh, the music doesn't get written very quickly...nothing does, this band is very slow. Look, we only have a guitar player and a drummer, and the drummer's part time! So...that's about it. You guys know where I get the inspiration from...it's all y'all. That's right, you all are PISSING ME OFF. No, not really. I mean, you know, stuff. I just look at life, and like...life kicks me in the balls, I write about it. Um...it's so sad, so sad,  listen: FEEL THE VOID, FEEL IT. There's nothing left, there is...that's all. That's it, man. Whatever...whatever...m'kay it's over. 'K I'm done. But guys...it's been great. I hope you enjoyed the CD and my cutting in every once in a while...um...some tracks need names, kinda bad. But, whatever. I hope you guys enjoyed the CD, and I hope to talk to you soon. Check out our new album IGNORANCE coming out soon...many tracks, some not yet heard! Very good! Like PROBLEMS. Like PROBLEMS! SO LOW's on there, BROKEN ME's on there. [sharp inhale] Yeah! That's right! You like that song, doncha? Yeah! Yeah...it's probably not going to be on here because the current incarnation is very bad, and it sucks. So guys...thanks for supporting STRANGLEBOX, I'm Josh. I'm guitarist, I sing sometimes. Thanks for listening. Peace.

      I did!  It sounds better now tho, don't worry. Less vocals, more guitar noise. I don't like hearing myself way too much, but a little bit is ok. It's like looking at yourself in the mirror times 119283740293475912437, but if you look too long you get a little self-concious.   Listening to  So Low  right now. Yes, it's a bit late for such things, but I had lots of coffee...sorry Abby! What else is there, besides beer? Which I'm probly about to imbibe, anyway. And then there's sewage water and that's pretty much it.  I talked to my cats in a Sean Connery voice about the importance of the grilled chesse sammich, and how I was the master, yet still in training by my forefathers, those lonely old bastards cooped up in apartments, very single and very unconcerned, sometimes drunk for days and having a hankering for food, and what do they make, but grilled chesse and tomato soup? And what should I do but screw up BOTH. You wouldn't think so but I CAN. I'm good at screwing that stuff up. But then I had horrible canned stew after which...made up for it? And white chocolate raspberry ice cream, which I have finally all-consumed. That's it, no more good food. I'm screwed. I'm out of ideas.   So...  So...  This is my first good caffeine trip in a long time, and somehow, BLogging is so much more enjoyable here, in this little glow of insanity, sitting here doing nothing but thinking about consumption and what a bastard I am.   Lindsey knows all the devious plans now. War har har. PLEASE don't tell, PLEASE? It's a surprise and all. It's bad enough with her little convincing smile and pathetic voice, every inch of my being wants to surrender but I CANNOT! So please don't tell. Ok, I know you won't but I'm just making sure.   Ugh. It's been a couple hours since I started this. Presently, I'm working on the CD. It doesn't have nearly as many tracks as I promised, but there's some stuff that no one's heard, older stuff, and some special commentaries!!! Three songs that are newish.  Let Me Go ,  Close My Eyes , and  So Low . And I think  Rhyme  is gonna be on there, an early bass cut of  Close My Eyes , and little snippets of experiment songs called  Down  and  Scarecrowman . And commentaries! From me! I'm so dumb. But I think you all will like it. I know your up to your asses in  Broken Me  and since I deleted it, it's pretty much not going on there, unless someone can get me a copy soon. And only one person has the original cut of  My Solution  on CD anymore. But that's ok. You guys are sick of those, I know. I made such a big deal out of them and now it's all over.  Whatever. My breath reeks of disfermented hopps and I'm making CDs like crazy. I have my little case here, and if one of these happen to have either of the two glory boys on it, you all will be first to know. I'm just going to leave this post as is, fo shieezey. I'll be back in a few minutes.  HAHA I found a copy of  Broken Me . Woot, it's going on there next.  Ok so...the tracklist so far...  1. Introduction 2. So Low 3. Goodbye My Friend 4. Let Me Go 5. Enjoying the CD? 6. Broken Me 7. My Solution (acoustic) 8. Down (demo cut) 9. Scarecrowman (demo cut) ( very  incomplete) 10. Little Rhyme 11. Bass riff (early  Close My Eyes  demos) 12. Until I Fall Away (cover) 13. That's all! 14. Close My Eyes  This CD is sounding good. I just finished remixing  Down ...it turned out really good for having four parts in it. And I left one intelligible line in at one point, so you all get to hear what it might have sounded like. WOOT. Time to mix  Scarecrowman  and make it sound like I wasn't playing with the damned riff for the first time that day...which I was...it was the same day I got the recorder. I recorded  Scarecrowman  and  Goodbye My Friend  for the first time.     Memories  ....  Wow...I didn't remember, but I gave up on trying to coordinate the guitar parts on  Scarecrowman  without drums so I started soloing...it sounds mostly the same, or bad...but there's this one place where it sounds fraggin' AMAZING! I'm letting it master itself right now...  Right...just a few more to go. I'm going to start a lyrics booklet that I'll email, including the deleted lyrics, even the ones to the cover. And a transcript of what I'm saying during the little retarded commentaries. But not the subliminal messages. I mean, what good are subliminal messages if you know what they're saying? Duh!  Beer tastes awful, but I'm thirsty. I could never be an alcoholic. I dunno what my dad sees in this shit. Gross.  Here's the boring part. Waiting for  Little Rhyme  to burn itself. God...every time me and Alex play this, we both look at each other and groan and say, "this so is sooooooooooo long!" and then we play it, because we always do, right after  Broken Me  and followed by  My Solution . We're beasts in those sessions. Alex kills himself trying to doublebass and I just kill myself jumping off of things, hitting my head on things, throwing things, yelling things, screaming all the lines of the song, saying them backwards, saying them in Arameic while doing a handstand, smoking a hashpipe, and playing my guitar which is somehow infested with a swarm of killer bees. This friends...is the part of the evening where the caffeine wears off and the alcohol kicks in.  As you all know, I have no alcohol tolerance whatsoever. And while this is a nonalcoholic beverage, it can't help but have a bit in it, because of the nature of its production. It has less than NyQuil in it. However, I have no tolerance, and were I to finish this bottle I might be a bit drunk, and me drunk...that's a bad thing. I'm either tired or depressed, or sometimes I say really funny things and start crying about them. This is another reason why I will never be an alcoholic.  I just heard a pop. That means  Rhyme  is done.   The bass riff is done. It's pretty shaky at the end cuz I forgot the main riff. But you'll get a good glimpse into where the riff for  Close My Eyes  came from. Damn...that was a rough song. It took most of the year to work out the perfect words. And the music was impossible. So one day I heard this riff in storage, and something clicked and I nailed it.  Close  is the last song on this record by the way.  Pop.   Until I Fall Away ...I haven't listened to that track since Christmas, when I recorded it...or thereabouts. It's a Gin Blossoms song, probly my fav of theirs...3 on  New Miserable Experience ...if you haven't heard of the Blossoms, I really suggest them. They don't sound anything like my music, but they're incredible musicians and songwriters, and they're coming to Georgia and bygod if I'm not going to see them. They're from Tempe, Arizona...that's where we're gonna be, along with Tuscon and Phoenix in a few weeks, so I get to visit the home of the Blossoms! And get some Coodukx shakes that Abby was talking about...heheh...I can't remember the real name of that place anymore....Iji, I think it was....Captain Iji? I dunno, it sounds pretty close. I'm plastered. Pop.  The outro is done, and now the last and awesomeest song.  Here I go.  Alright kids. It's burning, but I'm gonna go now and as soon as it's done, I'm going to listen to it and cry. And then, I'm going to burn all of you copies of this wonderful endeavor, and I sincerely hope you enjoy.  Starting on the lyrics booklet/notes thing.  Ciao for now, friends.

      You said sammich, haha!!!  Ok, my vote: no dreds, and i've got  great  reasons. (yeah, right.)  1.)  Darren, Anne-Marie's old drugged-up boyfriend had dreds, and he was completely awful to her.  2.)  Abby would hate you forever.  3.)  I would hate you forever, not that you really care about that one.  4.)  You would look like a freak.

      Ok it's really screwed up.  Absolutely NO ONE is here. That really sucks.  Forgive me all, it's been a pretty bad/hectic day...got pwned on my fav. map, "fy_snow" on CS, I downloaded some cool upgrades for it but nothing works yet...apparently my proficiency in typing what they tell me to type isn't all that good. Whatever.  I did drive my dad's new car today tho. It's not so bad...2001 Oldsmobile Alero. It's a GM product, and that sucks really hard. But it's not so bad...ok, there's no horn. The CD player is really bad. And it smells AWFUL in there, no matter what we do. So if no one wants to get in any time soon, I  definitely  understand. It was hard to get me to drive it home because of that disgusting festering sheep corpse smell in there.   I finished a manual with all of the songs on  Ignorance  today too, this morning in fact. It looks really nice, presentable, etc. But it's just for looks, it has no real purpose yet...sell it for a million bucks on EBay in a few years tho :)  I went to Olive Garden after we bought the car today...god, that was funny. They gave us a table in the smoking section (first available seating, so hey, it happens) so that kinda sucked. But then I decided to act uncultured and started blowing bubbles into my Coke, making fun of the rednecks at the other table because they thought they were a bunch of wine buffs and decided to send the poor guy to get another wine to sample every three minutes, and the best part: mooing at my dish of veal when it got there and constantly referring to it as "baby hamburger". I named all three pieces too: Ignatius, Floyd, and Xander...I got full after Ignatz (his shortened name) and Xander, so Floyd is chillin' in the 'fridge, pun intended. On the way home I named the car GAM, or  Gross Asshole Machine  and blared  The Beavis And Butt-head Experience  on the CD player, which has some really good Nirvana and Megadeth on it.  Then I ran and got attacked by two dogs, TWO, count them. Tomorrow when I run I'm bringing something heavy to use on them. But hopefully I won't be running at 789274952734095720394572 o'clock again.  I'm going to go finish Floyd and braid my hair, all. Ciao for niao.   ONE MORE THING, NEEDS TO BE VOTED ON   I'm thinking about getting dreds, yes or no? And  GOOD  reasons for your decision, not little Rosie ones like "you would look like a freak".

      Bonjour mes amis.  Well...I did it.  I beat LOTR (Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers)  ENTIRELY . WOOT!  It only took...what...a month? Damn. But tonight I just entered  I AM THE GREAT MASTER OF ELECTRONICS  mode and totally pwnsaured that damned game. It's got the best replay value ever. For instance...you get ratings on every level, and if your rating sucks, well...too bad, you can do a redo, but who wants to do that? So at the end of the game, it lets you play every mission over with every character, and you get to keep the new rating. And THEN, you get an assload of cheats, and they don't affect your score at all if you use them. AND THEN, you get a new, secret character, which you can rebeat all ze missions with. WHAT A GREAT CONCEPT.  So now that I've pwnsaured that game I'm really screwed. I have nothing to do.  Tomorrow I get to help my dad pick out a new car...used, but um...yah, whatever. Bankruptcy loans are really hard to get, kids, don't be an asshat and get into debt up to you eyeballs like that asspelunker did. So I'm gonna do that, whereafter I get to take my dad's car ANYWHERE, that's going to be badass.   But even still (and I've made this argument with everyone), even with all this new-found freedom of "having a license" and "driving a car solo" and "going places" "" is really overrated...there's not much to do, really. You can hang out with friends, sure. But they'll get tired of hangin' eventually, maybe, if you act like an asshat and get out of hand when it comes to hanging out. And then there's money, which is nice, if you have any...you would need a job for that, and if you have a job, well, you can't just laze around with the car all day.  You could go to parks and stuff...that's what I'm going to do, go to parks and stuff. Try to finish Rhetoric, work on some songs, hang out, get a tan, perhaps? Tired of being pasty. Go to the library, the main one in Nashville is BADASS. Perhaps, go explore cool little rundown places in Nashville...like Issac Litton High? That place looks SO screwed up. And I could do some hanging out with my Nashvegas villains, and I could drive to B-hizood, too. So hey, I just discovered that having a car is going to kick a lot more ass that I thought it would, and that I actually have developed some semblance of a life. W00T!  I am SO hungry. I haven't been eating too much lately, but when I do, I can't seem to get full. Been makin' chicken sammiches at three in the morn lately, which is really fun.  Speaking of, I'm doing a cookbook online of my wonderful recipes, which include  Chicken Sammich ,  Ham Sammich ,  Chocolate Milk , and  Water  as of now, complete with pictures, supply list, and full commentary! Working on chicken right now...I actually sound like I know what I'm doing, and that is just wrong when it comes to the kitchen. Ask my dearest Abby Mac, poor girl...subjected to my horrible, HORRIBLE chefing once...OH GOD. I still feel so bad. I knew I wasn't watching that grill and that I should be but...agh. I should start memorizing pizza numbers for when we have company. AGH.  I AM SO SORRY ABBY, I AM AN AWFUL COOK, AND THAT'S A TOTAL BLASPHEME TO YOUR BEING, BEING AS THOU ART ZE MASTER CHEF AND ALL.  Speaking of which, Abby says she is going to teach me to cook a dish with a name longer than two words...that really hurts my head. I can make "Chicken Sammich" (and I know I'm spelling "sandwich" wrong, by the way), not "Butterflied Whimsical Scallopini Du Jour With Defenestration of Prague In A Light Tartar Sauce". But hey...I trust she'll know what she's doing, and perhaps it'll rub off? Ok, too hopeful. There's not a force in this damned world that can crack my thick-foreheaded, retarded brain, not even the most wonderful girlfriend imaginable.  I developed my pics today. Apparently they don't develop "art" anymore. THAT'S RIGHT KIDS! They eliminated my inner-pocket shot entirely! I mean come ON. It was ART! They KILLED IT!   This is me yelling really loud:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  I hate them I hate them I hate them.  But I feel accomplished cuz I beat LOTR so there. And some of the pics came out durned good, so I'm still stoked out of my mind. I have TWO, count'em, TWO pictures of ze Camillion (aka, Camille), my wonderful pusscat. And two of Abby, my wonderful girlfriend. And one of my black eye, and one of me at five in the morning. And one of Alex lighting a bottle rocket. And one of my hand holding a lit bottle rocket, poised to throw it at Alex, who is fleeing in the darkness in the background (that one went off in my hand, by the way...ouch). And several more of the cats and dogs, one of the inside of the piano, two or three of some writing on my hands. And I turned the cam on myself and randomly took a pic and it turned out really good. And my dad took a standing one of me, so I've got that. And I have some of my parents, and I have outside on my front porch, and I have one of a cool tree at the church.  I hope you're not reading all of that, but if you are, I really applaud you, because you are really bored, just like me.  I'm going to watch a movie about a gay drag bar now (The Birdcage). G'noight all.

      HI all.  Two things. One, there is a huge storm outside and I'm about to get totally pwned by it. It's really big. Pray for me, just as I'll be praying for the rest of you. Hope we don't haven't another repeat of that shiet before...I wouldn't have a chance of surviving at my dad's house.  Second of all, I can't believe how degraded the Jerry Springer show has become. Yah, it was bad back in the day...the constant cussing, the people taking off their shirts/pants to make a point, and sure, that's bad. But it gets worse...now the audience has become totally corrupted. When anyone asks a question (especially hot girls) or when someone gets into an argument, it's no longer "KICK HIS/HER ASS!", it has now become, "TAKE IT OFF!" They don't want to fight, they want an excuse to see some skin. I guess that makes sense, sure. But jeezus, what a level of degradation. Pretty soon, Jerry's gonna be just one big televised bacchanal, killing and raping on the twelve o' clock tube.  THE END IS NEAR, REPENT SINNERS. But while we're at it, let's enjoy ourselves by watching a lot of dumbasses beat the shit out of each other and strip down to their birthday suits and rub dubious substances on one another.   Ah...cable...

      Alex would like to say to all:  [nothing] [gives the finger] says, "Fuck off."  He is over here right now, and we are playing cool games, looking at pics of decapitated people, watching CKY, making really funny music videos (Alex is now lead guitarist, he is god), and eating good stuff. We were going to walk to necessary ten miles to Taco Bell, but chickened out due to the fact that we don't want to get shot real bad, so we didn't. Alex says we can go there tomorrow. And I agree.  Now, were going to do something else. Pus...I mean, Alex wants to go to sleep. It's only three and a half you fuck. What the HELL dude? You're such a woman. Only women go to sleep early. That leaves the men to sit around and drink and smoke expensive cigars/weed (at Alex's request). Ok, I'm going to shut up now so as to not get in trouble with women any more than I already will (especially with Abby...*tears* I miss her so).  Alright kids. G'nite for now. Wow, it's cool that I can type so good.

      Hiya dudes et dudettes.  Something's wrong with my body. First, I was doing some moving for a friend of my dad's so my whole body is sore...understandable. I also sprained my wrist while trying to do creative football catches. Also understandable.  The thing I don't understand...one, my joints are killing me, it hurts to move anywhere, I always moan a lot when I do. I attributed this to growing pains or something until the burns started...at the same places, there's these burns that make the skin on those places feel like it's going to tear in half. It's not visible either...it's like it's under the skin. But it's definitely there.  So that's kind of disturbing.  But anyway...god am I sore. Not only moving, there was the failed Flying Squirrel dive, the failed Buttbuster on the diving board (I hit my legs  hard  on the board going under), the bad dive for the football...that was really funny tho. It was all good until I tried to jump backwards for one and landed on my hand. Ouch, but it feels loads better now, versus then. And there were countless bumps and scrapes with furniture trying to get it inside and down THOUSANDS of stairs...at least, that's what it felt like. And I burned some skin on my knuckle. It was the weirdest thing ever, I got my hand caught a bit between a car and a drawer I was carrying outside, and it seriously cooked the skin on my knuckle. It hurt like a bitch too. But then I had some kind of strawberry-flavoured Sobe and it took my mind off it it.  That strawberry Sobe stuff is really good, by the way. I know it's one of those "cool people" drinks but they're incredibly good.  I ran at 11:30 today...it seems that everyone lets their dogs free at night, and leave the gates open and stuff, so that the dogs can come out and socialize. Unfortunately, Nashville dogs in their East Nashville environment have become more bellicose than most dogs. These dogs are killers. So needless to say, today's run was a great cardiovascular workout, and the expression "don't look back" is incredibly applicable, to emotional situations and otherwise. Scruffy and I learned that lesson very well today, he as the teacher, of course. And if anybody is watching these dogs trying to gore me, they sit there and laugh. Nevermind the fact that I'm just a kid, one that tries to reason with these dogs before they devour a part of my hand. They laugh even harder when I use, in a very soothing voice, the words "puppy" and "good boy". This often amuses the dogs too, tho to a different degree, I might add.  I haven't slept since Friday, and here I am up again, high on coffee (really late dinner) and reading about Drunks With Guns and Tad. The underground grunge movement was amazing.  Until til next time kids. "Ah, the joys of bathing."

I mean, you could rightly tell me to fuck off, (hopefully not in those terms) but I want to help if I can...or even if I can't.  Please, guys.  ~Z

I hope.  13 days till Abby gets home...  AHHHHHHHH!!!  Don't know how I'm going to tell her... she's going to KILL me.  Anyway, can you come to church tomorrow???

      Well...I'm not sure what my problem is.  I think it's that I hate my dad for what he did to my mom and me and also that I want some closure but can't seem to get it.  But I'm not sure...hell, that's why I'm in therapy.  Anyway, never said I wouldn't talk about this on YOUR site...;)  Hehehehe...anyway, if you guys are sick of my whining then you can read it in a more contained form on my site.  Perhaps tomorrow will yield a rather interesting post...My eyes don't want to stay open anymore, so I'd better crash.  Talk to you guys later.  And thanks for the wisdom, Josh.  I really appreciate it.  ~Z

      Still depressed eh...  You know...the best advice I ever got while being depressed came from that self-help book. I don't know if this applies at all, or if you're willing to accept it, because I have no idea about this situation, but the majority of the book deals with being able to accept the fact that we can't change people, only that we can accept ourselves. And I don't know why, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made until depression isn't really hard to deal with anymore. Well it depends on the dosage, and the time of day and how drunk I am. But whatever, I'd bet that book would help out a lot, if you'd like.  I was up until 4 this morning playing Snake 2 on my dad's cell and staring absently at the ceiling, listening to the storm outside, and beforehand, a series of booms that definitely weren't thunder because they kept answering each other, but sounding like it still. And of course, nobody else heard them. They weren't on the news. Fireworks, maybe? Those were some fireworks, just cuz of how fast they were going off. And considering that yesterday was...July 29 WOOT, what a festive day....  I was awake because I had become just physically addicted enough to NyQuil to become a tad impaired in the sleep department. And then I had to wake up at six to take my da to work. So blah, tons of morning [sic]ness. But I got over that fast enough, and we drove down Woodland Avenue to his office; I've never been that way before, but there's some awesome stuff on Woodland Ave. Like, awesome shops and stuff. It's awesome. So I'm hoping to get the car tomorrow and go check it out.    Casablanca  is SUCH a badass movie...but the ending! It sucks! RAGH! It's a freaking oldie, there's supposed to be only good endings on those suckers. WAAAAAAAAHHHH. That was me crying for the end of said movie. Dude, Humphrey Bogart is such a pimp. As stated on Linds's BLog, I am going to become him from now on. It is thus that you will see me about school walking around in Italian leisure wear, drinking lots of bourbon and smoking expensive cigarettes, and generally being a badass...and Abby's going to hate me, heheheh. But perhaps the suave charm of my being Humphrey will help her ignore the kinky haircut and alchoholic drool smell that follows me everywhere, and the poss and whatnot. Ok, I can't do it, so what. God knows I'm not charming. Nor can I afford a constant supply of bourbon and cigs, or be able to pay off all the teachers to allow me to intake such pleasures in their classrooms.   Well, I can always dream...  And kids, guess what...only two weeks 'til school starts. YIPPEE! I'm excited. Not really. My drum teacher had Mrs. Bayrd when he was in BHS...when I said I was taking AP US History, he asked the teacher...I didn't remember, he looks at me and says "Bayrd?"...I nodded, he gave me the "Shall I get the shells or do you have some in your pocket" look. So I'm excited, once again. Apparently he walked right the hell out of her classroom because he didn't like her. Hell yah JD. And that's what I'm probably going to do because, bygod, I intend to not work as much as possible this year and get by. Even tho I brought all this on my self. I don't care anymore, at all. I have lost every will to be better than anyone at anything, to stand out academically, to be renowned as smart.  I've lost it. And it feels wonderful.  I mean sure, I'll still go about respecting basic school rules and stuff. But past that, I don't care. Homework can go suck an egg. So can this dumb essay for that matter.   Wow, I'm going to fail, that's great.  Well...heheheh. There's a bit of work in store, I have a feeling that I'll be doing better this year, coming in with a lot less on my mind as last year. But I intend not to stress, and I encourage all of you to follow suit. Altho that's entirely wasted on Rosie but Lord knows I've tried.  Going to play some CS and clock out. Bon voyage, kids!

      Scary thought there, Josh.  You might have some kind of demon spawn in there.  That's a sobering thought, so maybe you'll get off the NyQuill.  Hope that you are feeling better.  I am...a little.  But I'm still kind of depressed.  Anyway, talk to you later.  ~Z

      HI all.  So guess who called while I was sitting here druggedly playing CS?   Alex. He wanted to know something about FFT and I was like, "Dude...you waste 9 bucks to ask me a question that you could easily have answered on the internet?" I helped him the best I could, but I was sorta preoccupied so I don't know if I told him all the right things. Plus, the NyQuil seems to have reached that stage where it doesn't want to wear off anymore. That means I'm addicted, and that really sucks. It's a good thing this shit is just beefed up Tylenol or I would have probably died of an OD.  It was funny when I had to drive my dad to the hospital for eye surgery today. I was pretty much cussing everyone, I missed the street a few times, I almost got killed a few times (amazingly, didn't almost cause anything myself), I went to Krystal for my dad and was wearing my evil-looking Aerosmith t-shirt...the guy behind the counter looked at it for a few minutes (a very gay black man, and I don't say "gay" as defamation of character), and didn't say a word after that. So that was really great, and when he doesn't even acknowledge me, it's everyone else's turn to gawk at me and see what I did. As if it's their business. I'm a long-haired, pot-faced teenager! What kind of shirts am I supposed to be wearing, Right to Life Ts? For crying out loud!  But after that I went to Richland Park with a notepad and listened to CDs and eventually got out of the car and sat on a bench and drafted a few songs. One is called  Shiver , the other is called  Acetaminophen ...wonder where I got the name to that one. I've said the word  acetaminophen  at least once in the last two of my posts. Altho I spelled it wrong... acetominophen . But whatever.  So then I go to a drum lesson and play a brand-new kit, and we discuss selling out, and he insists that that's what I'm going to have to do to get famous. Screw that. It almost makes me want to abandon music and go back into being an FBI agent. I was hooked on that for a while. Or a psychologist...or the other one, whichever doesn't use drugs. You can see how well I'm researching my future.   So now here I am, and it's past 11:10 tonight so it's all good, and I'm about to probably play CS again altho I have to get up mucho early tomorrow. It doesn't matter anymore. Time passes like ribbons on the wind these days, I won't even notice I lost sleep...except for the morning [sic]ness. I get morning sick. Yah, that's right, I'm pregnant. I don't know who the father is. That's the way these things go.  Actually, if that were so, I've been pregnant for the last five years, and I only get sick when I don't get enough sleep, or if I have to get up earlier than I'm used to. I think the latter is what causes it. But nevertheless, I'm pregnant! I must be incubating some kind of monster, considering.   I talk too much. That sucks. Why didn't anyone tell me? I guess it's my brain, which works really hard, just not in the right areas (i.e.: application of the remotest energies to school, thus resulting in  GOOD GRADES FOR A CHANGE )  I'm shutting up now. G'nite my special people.

      Heheh, you bet I'm trying.  Yours was really really bad tho...when I got it, it wasn't debilitating. Heavy meds, lots of freaking out, and a world of pain...whereas we figured you'd never come back, but you did so yay :).   I'm on drugs right now. If any of you wants to borrow anything or tell me exactly how they feel about me, now is the time...I won't remember jack. The fever's down cuz of more acetominophen (I would say Tylenol but...I'm taking Brand-X acetominophen) so that buzzing "monsters are eating my insides" feeling is down for now.  BROOKS WILL NOT STOP CALLING. What part of "FUCK OFF YOU FUCKIN' FUCK" doesn't he understand...and that's a direct quote, by the way, with all the will my dying throat could muster. ARGH. So if he calls again I'm going to invoke the sacred rites of Yog Sogoth, Black Goat with 1000 Young and have them eat his soul, yippee!  And I found the greatest game in the world to play while hallucinating. It's called  Meeklits , from the creators of  Snood . Anyway, it's really annoying at first, until you experiment a bit and figure it all out. And then it's even more annoying. But somehow it's a great game. I was reminded of the word "smertastic" while playing it, for some reason. Again, I'm blaming the 'Quil.  But anyway, going to listen to some Jerry and see if I can't calm down a little. The song  Pro False Idol  by this man is quite possibly the most beautiful song I have ever heard.

      Um, hi all.  Ouch. Sitting at the drop-off window of Eckerd's yesterday, I discovered I was getting sick and that I should probably do something about it...of course, I was too late, and in just a few hours it came to life.  I thought it was mono round 2 at first...the hot-cold spells, the feeling of parasite heat in my brain, the hallucinations (and yesterday I had some good ones, my dad was FREAKED)...but I'm getting better pretty fast so I don't think it's mono. Altho the letters are coming on the screen a lot slower than I'm typing them...actually, the whole world is kinda moving in slow motion right now so that might mean a new wave.   Rosie, I noticed you called earlier. I've been sleeping most of the day, I was asleep then, but you'll be happy to know that the phone ringing was incorporated into one of the most [sic] and twisted dreams I've ever had. I don't remember what it was, I just remember jerking awake and scaring the cats when I yelled.   Speaking of remembering stuff...I don't really remember today at all. I don't remember yesterday. That must mean the acetominophen is wearing off, cuz I can feel that little buzz of fever coming back in. I'm going to cry. I hope I didn't pass this to Abby, whatever it is.  I tried cooking yesterday...that was when the first hallucination hit. And since then I've pretty much been a vegetable, eating oatmeal-raisin cookies (my second fav, next to peanut butter) and watching  BUFFY: THE FOURTH SEASON  on DVD. That show is really badass. Altho I finished it today so now I have nothing to do.  And of course...Abby is gone until after school starts, and that's making me a very weepy chimp...but I have pictures now!, so that's a bit of a bonus. But I'm still a weepy little chimp. Alex is gone until the fifth, so no sessions, but I am going to do some recording when I get better. Brooks, whom I've been playing CS with a lot lately, is about to leave for la Floride...and I yelled at him today for calling back two hours after I told him that I was really sick and needed to get some sleep. He called again and I hung up on him...I think he got the point now.   Sorry for talking so much, everyone. I'm desperate for company but I'm not very pleasant in the conversation department right now...so I'm probably going to isolate myself until I get better. So if I don't answer posts/the phone in the next few days, you'll know why.  Well, my dad's back with some more White Cranberry-Strawberry Cocktail stuff now (it's the best Brand-X juice in the universe...on sale at Kroger   NOW  !!!!) so I'm going to go down some and try to get some more sleep.  Until we meet again.

      Quite a bit of stuff to say today, actually.  1) Good for you for quitting AP English.  That's the bum in me coming out.  Now if Rosie could just take lessons from you... 2)  Cody Blonder is in my homeroom...you've done some stupid things.  3)  I miss Abby, but I'm gonna be killed.  4) Kentucky is a cool state, except that everyone smokes, and caves are REALLY cool.  4) Rosie, what the HELL is going on?  But whatever it is, I'm sorry.  5) Liz, I love your livejournal, cause of the "song o'day" and the little thing that tells what mood you're in, especially.  6) Don't make fun of John Lennon's death.  It was a national tragedy.  I refuse to this day to read Catcher in the Rye.  7)  What does h4x4ur$ mean?  8)  Justine was actually there?  Does she have nothing better to do?  8)  Did you just say dawgs?  9) Jared just e-mailed me.  He's a sweet guy, slightly ADHD, but a good guy, all the same. 9) 1 month and 19 days till my b-day, but 1 month 21 days till I get my license.  I'm such a loozer.

      Perhaps...but you also have to take into consideration how much I care about school...that is to say, not at all. Plus, I still have 2 APs, and I could probably safely bet that that's a lot better than average, at least on a national basis.  I'm just a bum, what can I say? Plus I need to get a job (probably already said that) and stuff.  I always underestimate, it's like a part of me.

      Well thank ya Z, for your support in this issue.   I dunno...I guess I jez had my head in the clouds when I signed up for it. I have to put in a form on Monday to get it changed, and I hope that's all I have to do. It'll be mighty embarrasing coming into the class with no paper, mumbling about switching out. Crying.  I mightily pwned at CS tonite. I really pissed off Brooks, too. He wanted me to turn off the gravity, and most times people will assert their dominance on the game by telling you to do something, then killing you a couple of times until you do it, or you kick them off of your game. Well, in Brooks's case, I kept killing him and he kept telling me to stop, and I didn't, of course. So then he started insults, and I did some back, and Brooks found out I'm a lot better than him at it. So the worst he could do was call Alex and cry about it, whereafter Alex came back with the same nonchalant news of "Brooks doesn't want to play with you anymore". O, STILL, MY HEART. But really...people get so damn touchy...not about the game, about other people. It's like we can't even respect the fact that some people are new to the game, and sometimes things, like in real life, just aren't fair. That some people are better than others, things like that...yes, I even blame myself in this category. I still blame people as "hacking" when they're doing too good...but honestly, I'm right a lot of times...it's hard to miss h4x4ur$ easily.  I'm starting to sound like that damn book, Catcher in the Rye. Wow, somebody help me...I'm not kidding.  Anyway...I went to Seth's house today, he had a prelim vid of Shitfiend...two, actually. He had one called "THE BAND" that was of us and Alex playing  Freedom ,  Master of Puppets  (mostly), and  Santa's Coming , the CKY version. AND he put part that Chingy song that I think is so godly in there. Chingy is the greatest rapper, right next to 50 Cent. LOL J/K A-HOLZ.   And the other video was called  FIRE ...all of our fire stunts. Yes, that includes me getting my ass blown off my body, a couple of times, and Seth lighting himself on fire, and me filming fire really close up, and us throwing basketballs at Alex while he rides through a flame downhill on a scooter. And other stuff. And  Welcome to the Jungle  is playing in the background. It looks so amazing...the best part is, he says he didn't use hardly  any  of the footage. We have enough right now to put into a full-length vid, but it would be boring. So we're going to stretch it out a bit...shopping cart tryx in winter, fun with leaves and Halloween and skits about 'Nam in the backyard right now. More car stuff, more band stuff, more Chingy. More pool stuff if we can fit it all in. And some of us will probably have nicknames. Like, in the credits of the first cut of the video, Seth refers to me as "assrocket". That's like Art Webb 1986 or Raab Himself for those that follow CKY/Jackass.   I'm eating like a horse these days. I went to this little hole in the wall BBQ joint for dinner...it was pretty durned good. I had a cheeseburger and fries, the best fries I've had in my life, and my dad had a half-side of ribs (that a helluva lot) and okra and baked beans. And so we sat there and talked up a storm with the owners while they cooked our stuff, and they kicked out some homeless guy for the "thousandth time today", and some guy said he thought he knew me but he didn't. The place was called "Justine's Southern BBQ", and there's a teenage girl there named Justine...hence. It'll probably be sold and bought in a few months, it always is, but check it out, it's always some kind of grill joint or another. That was the first time in my life I've eaten there, it was ass-kick.  Well, crack a grin all, this may be the last one you get 'til hell lets out again.   Until such time as we meet, adieu.

      Aww w00t, I have a nail file here and I should really use it to deflate my head right quick.  Apple and cinnamon oatmeal is really good for lunch. I just had that, and I had a PB et J for breakfast. So my eating schedule is sdrawkcab but it's alright...I'm recording today and I deserve it.  GOD, how I hate and love recording. Especially since no one is here to help me...the problem is, my cables don't stretch far enough, so I can't set the console next to me. Which means, I have to press record, then do a dive to get over the drum kit and on the throne so I can start. Blah, plus, I haven't configured the mics to this new setup, so I have to keep stopping the damn thing, undoing it all, and starting it over til I get the levels all right. But considering no one cares about this wonderous incident in its text form, it's all good, once again.  I dropped AP English today...eep, sorry if I piss off anyone by this, I just might. But I figure, I really need to get a job, plus I don't understand what I'm doing 90% of the time while tackling the subject matter. But it's ok because I've already done the summer reading for Honours,  Pudd'nhead Wilson  by Mark Twain, which was a really good book, and  Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger, which was a really weird book. I could see why it would drive some nutcase to kill somebody...it made  me  want to kill somebody. But I finished that "classic" piece of literature and so it's all out of the way.  In other words, I'm set for school, who else is? No, don't answer, talking about school is too painful, I just remembered.  I miss Abby. But she'll be here in like, five minutes so **YE-AH**...not literally but whatever. But I really do, a whole lot.   Because you all really care...   Heheheh.  Well, have fun kidz, hopefully BLogger will stop being scroo'd and get back to the norm. Peace out dawgz.

      Oh no. They changed the format again. WHY? ARGH!  Anywayz dudez, it's really quiet over here and I'm lonely. Boo-freakin'-hoo. I've been keeping busy the past two days or so, and now that no one's here, there's a prominent and reverberating echo that follows me everywhere.  To sum things up...most of that time was occupied by  THE VIDEO .  Yesterday we went to Bi-Lo, where we filmed us defiling a can of peanut butter and putting it back on the shelf, and then looking at condoms and attempting to buy some and make it embarrasing as possible, all the while on film! We were throw out thereafter, tho.   So, thus pissed, we went to some nearby shrubs and did some damage. Seth jumped into them once and smacked his skateboard into the curb and fell into them...I did a stagedive on them, face first, whereafter I rolled out the front and was witnessed by a couple 'o people, but no cops. So we didn't get arrested and that was great.  We also filmed other stuff...it's pretty gross and I won't go into detail. But it's not us streaking (yet) so don't worry about it.  At home, Seth and I designed the logos for this production, which is called SF, which stands for either ShitFiend or StupidFriends, depending on the audience. But moreover, it can stand for whatever you want it to. We just like ShitFiend.   We also wrote a parody of Good Charlotte's  The Anthem  and a song making fun of Star Wars with an awesome porn music background. w00t w00t.  And THEN...it was the next morning, and battling a lot of rain, we managed to get Alex and Brooks over here. There were many preliminary stunts with fire...LOTS of stuff is flammable. Seth's hand, basketballs, his skateboard, the ground...if it was burnable, we burned it :) It was amazingly fun to watch; moreover it was a middle finger to the age old clich "play with fire and you get burned".  I  didn't get burned so HAH. Well, at least at this moment in the story.  Then, we had Brooks ride down the driveway on a scooter and got Alex to pelt him with a basketball. He had some impressive wounding from hitting the agregate. Alex did it to and we filmed it from a downhill perspective, with me, my sister, Brooks, and Seth throwing balls at him. He was also injured by this encounter tho not as much because he stuck to the grass. Mostly it was that getting hit in the head really hard part that made him wail.   AND THEN THE FIREWORKS. I had one more left in my house so we used that...I donned a new pair of jeans and took it in the right pocket, or so dictates tradition. We got it on film...it looks like I'm getting shot in the ass. I could watch it all day and never get tired of it. There's also the aftermath of me being on fire, where I take the hose and put myself out.   We later went to Brooks's house and got his MASSIVE box of fireworks. I said (very foolishly) that I would take ten in the back pockets. They argued my will to six, deeming me much too insane and wanting to preserve the lower part of my body for motor purposes...wheelchairs, people, wheelchairs, but they didn't listen...SO. Three in each pocket. Surprisingly they all lit and exploded...that it truly an assorted rarity in bunching bottlerockets.   Then, Alex threw one at me and it landed in my back pocket somehow...when it went off it streaked down to my ankle and blew.  And by the way...not any of that caused the burn.  The burn came from the last one. I told Brooks to give me one for the road and I filmed it myself. I don't know why but that one pwned me. I got a bit burnt so ouch. But it was all in the name of fun so "smile all" to quote Rosie.   And remember, if I die, I die smiling, and that's what matters.  We also have some really awesome footage of me and Alex performing  Master of Puppets  and  Freedom . Seth is a pretty wykd fotographer.   Anyway kids...that's about it. Just thought I would give an update and tell everyone how dumb I'm being so the rest of you can feel that much smarter.  Peace.

      Heheh w00t, talking longer than me in one sentence, NOT FAIR! In a few seconds here, I am going to devise the longest sentence ever, one that consists of much nonsense and other such entities of babble, and am going to stretch it out to the longest extent possible, perhaps so long that it may induce a comatose state in its peruser, perhaps an aneurysm or such other maladies, in which case I would feel exceptionally horrible because I was trying to be on top of the literary dung heap, and all it has brought me is death, chaos, and destruction, the three black goats of creation, christened before time and held only by the bonds of reality as we know it, the impermeable realm of what is considered as "true", until such times as they are needed, and if this sentence (which has become the longest sentence on Antiphilanthropy and, in fact, ever) does kill someone, we shall know that their services have been duly rendered on this earth once again, starting here on my humble 'net abode and spreading the whole world over as they have since man first interacted, O brutal agony.  That was the biggest bit of psychobabble I've ever heard, but I WIN! \v/h0 c|@ /\/\@|\|? i c|@ /\/\@|\|!   \/\/00T!  3L337 is ASS-BAD. Hoo-ah!  I just finished another song for the official demo! That makes two out of a necessary "eight", and hopefully a "ten", because I'd rather just hear them all now, instead of playing out in my head like they always do. But the newest one,  Painpainted  sounds rather like it did in my head... Problems , the other, is significantly close. There's lots of screaming in  Painpainted , it's amazing. It reminds me of Linkin Park, and it would make sense that I was listening to them a lot at the time of the authoring of this song. Amazing.  So I figure, since I've been thus turned down in English, that the only way to get out of it will be to not be here at all...that means, I'm going to come home every day and finish at least one song, and hopefully I'll get the tape approved, and hopefully I'll need to go record, and hopefully I'll go touring...in which case...G'BYE BENTW00D!   EEk, perhaps before I was a bit scared to go anywhere, but now I have some incentive (despite it being a bit juvenile), so I figure I'll just act on it and pay with a heroin OD when I'm 30 (I get to die later Abby, YAY!) and such.   But that will require finding someone that'll take us on, us and our "non-descript genre" selves. Some guy who listened to us the other day defined us as being "punk"...that's badass. I dunno what we are. It like...hip-hop, hard rock, punk, metal, etc., probly a thousand things and that's why I can't label me. Cry. But that doesn't really matter because the next album ( Into the Outside , BUY TODAY!) is going to be incredibly heavy and most of the songs are already in the works...more punk-ish. But that, friends, is for another day.  WOW, I'm jacked on caffeine and I just got done recording and sweating all over the place from doing it (drumming with no fans on, no windows open, closed AC vent...for sound quality, as abysmal as it is). YAY! And now I'm going to Nashville, so you troopers have a wonderful day and I'll see ya down on the upside.  Hoo-AH!

      Yes, I attest, because I told her, and I'M NOT DEAD!!!!  Just thought I'd share.  Actually, she took it really well.  She was just like "Lindsey, you know I'll support you in whatever you do." which I know already, but forgot, but she really does support me in whatever craziness I get myself into, except for when it comes to Ryan, then she pwns me, but that's ok, because by that time I need to diem, but other than that is very supportive and I love her to death, she's the bestest friend ever.  *Gasp* Thatwasaverylongsentence...

      Hell no he won't. Leastways I'll kill him.  With a gun!  I'm about to write my shrink's analysis on my psycho today. I was christened with my "Ph. D." for good shrinking skills, WHEE! So I bought a little notebook to analyse stuff like that and put other random stuff. For instance, starting today, in about three or four years, I could tell you what I had for breakfast... TODAY . I'll definitely be breaking that little clich in no time.  I'm seriously diggin' Psycho-logy because it has less to do with facts and more with gut instinct and personal thought, and for some reason it's a really easy class to connect with. I've only been in there two days and it's my fav. ever.   Plus I've been thinking of being a shrink for a long time, so that just ices the fragging cake.  In other news...I was almost finished recording another song ( Problems ) and suddenly my room decided to have a problem of its own in the matter of voltage...the room is f0cking dead. Well sort of. It has to do with messing up my gain structure...or how much sound I can get without getting distorted. So right now, I can get almost no volume and all gain. So for what you hear, it's a little fuzzy buzz in the background. And it was going SO WELL! The gain was  PERFECT  on the drums, all I had to do was some decibel adjustments and now they sound GREAT. And the bass went  INCREDIBLY  too, it sounds really nice and I got a good reverb (sort of shower room echo, that's reverb) on it too...and some delay (takes part of the sound and broadcasts it a few seconds later) which makes it sound even better. And THEN...the   ALMIGHTY RIFF   that goes in the chorus along with accompaniment rhythm. So I was about to do the heavy guitars.  Eh? Why's the little bar-mahickey not going up?  For those of you less educated in musical terminology, "bar-mahickey" refers to the digital readout of gain I'm getting from the source signal, in this case, my guitar. Now you know, fools. HAHAH JK  It was really cool in Mrs./Ms. (married? I dunno) Bayrd's class today because she was making fun of Confederations and she talked about one going on in the 1980s. She believes that these people should look at past confederations and see the mistakes therein, but because they didn't, Mrs./Ms. Bayrd let go a booming, "FOOLS!" and continued on. So from now on, when I'm slightly peeved at someone or trying to be annoying, I shall be using the terms "YOU CAN GET BACK TO WORK!" and "FOOLS!" at whatever juncture necessary. Along with "w00t" and "downer", as Lindsey can attest that I did today, to Julian for some reason.   Julian didn't point out the fact that  Downer  is, in fact, a Nirvana song, and I thought he was the biggest Nirvana-head ever. He made fun of my cKy pin today and asked me if I liked EMO...wherever the hell he gets that cKy is EMO...plus, EMO is badass anyway, yo. Taking Back Sunday, for instance. ASS-BAD.  So guys, that's it. I'm really long winded and I should be shot with a gun or bow and killed. Thank you for your time.  This is J-Funk-Killa saying "PEACE!"

      You have no idea how much better that makes me feel, but Rachel's back, so who knows what can happen.  If he finds out, he'll transfer back.  No, surely he won't, but still...

      I know I know not to but...just thought I would mention. He's a really incredibly psychotic kid. I wouldn't be surprised to find a copy of  Catcher  on his person, sumwharz. He's going to Middle College forever, so he's removed from the total picture...no worries. Unless I keep running into him at the mall. But yah.  Whee everyone's in for Firehouse,  bonus ...well, a couple o' ya anywayz. I miss all of you already...*crying*.  So anyways Lindseyreid (intentional spelling), Nosy-Rosie-Posie-Tao-Tao-LilChi-Jiang, Z, Will, Brittany (if you're on), and all of the wonderful viewers of this establishment...HAVE AN EXCELLENT DAY!

      You KNOW not to mention that name in my presence.  Abby will KILL you if she finds out you did, meaning of course, I have to tell her.  But is he going to BHS again this year, or is he in middle college?  Rachel's back from Alabama, yeah, she was in jail, and I'm scared out of my mind.  I'm in for Firehouse.  My b-day weekend again, or before?  I had 2 and a half curls too.

      Yo yo Bs and Gs.  Alex was over tonite and gave me dinner, what a good guy. I lay starving to death, and he called and was equally starving and tired as I was, so he brought some chicken wings and we ate them, then Alex narrowly missed a windshield while hitting a baseball, and all the while I shouted odd noises that echoed off of nearby houses and sang such songs as  Chinese Freestyle ,  Santa's Coming  (cKy version of course, "Is there anything you can do? YOU CAN GET BACK TO WORK!), and  The Skeletor Song . There's also a really cool dood down the street named Cody, he has an electric scooter and he was riding around helping us get the ball back when we hit it, and he brought up that he can play guitar, so Alex and I naturally looked at each other and watched each other's lightbulbs come on, and we ran over yelling "SCOOTER KID COME OVER!" He said he had to go, so I invited him to the session tomorrow where we will test him out. If he isn't much good, he can just do all the rhythm and I'll take the leads. I'm just happy to have a dood now, I dun really care how good he can play as long as he can play. He looks like a punx0r kid tho...so time's gonna tell on this one.  And also...Kenzie's not out of school tomorrow, so we're short one demi-bass player until this weekend, whereupon she has consented to learn the bass parts from me. Lily might also be coming to watch, so she can report back about the wonderful joys of a session. WHEE! Sessions are only good if we're hyper. Other than that, we just like hearing ourselves play the songs and making them feel good...hence the audience is bored. However, you should have seen the practice sessions for  Freedom , and look at the end result there. The sessions were boring even for me...that has a lot to do with the fact that I only did one song, tho, and I had to watch Joe tell bad jokes and try to sing rawk songs, the poor guy. But hey, I'm pretty sure that we were well-liked by all.  So w00t. I went to the mall today, for the second time this week...and consequently, for the second time this week, I've met Ryan Jones both times while walking out of Hot Topic. Today he was talking about being stoned and screwing...I had no idea what he was talking about. But he did talk a lot and I just sort of sat there and let the pot fumes permeate the essence of my being...it was HELLA STRONG. But yah...at least it was worth it, I found something cool in HT that is, in fact, incredibly cool.  But otherwise, this day has been a real downer. When I ran today I was so tired that I passed out when I finally got back. But then I watched BET for a while and Chingy was on so that made up for it. Then I redecorated my room a bit and got my pedal board working, after having it broken for the last, what, six months?, so I was excited. Then I put up my pics of Abby on my nightstand and admired them for a while, she looks so nice. My mom went on another date tonite, and my sis was at Colour Guard, so again, I had the house to myself.  Alex is now officially my bitch. He said if I let him take this combat knife I have and stab it thru my door he would play anything I wanted him to. In fact, I let him do it four times. It doesn't matter since we're getting new ones, and he knows it, but still. My door looks hella wykd now, it's got a kick mark at the bottom from where my foot met it once, the beginnings of a scratching of "Stranglebox" in the wood, several dart marks, four knife marks, two of which went all the way thru, and a punch mark where Alex got miffed and decided that my door was to blame. I beat him mercilessly for that one, that was before my mom goes, "NU DOORS, W00t!" But still. He f-ing punched a hole in my f-ing door. *cry* No more privacy for me, not that I'm really doing anything to warrant any mistrust but still...my piggy had two and a half curls on the tail...har har har.  That personality test, the one with the pig, told me that I was optimistic or a realist...meaning I'm no longer a downer...WHAT? What happened? Did something profound strike my manically depressed soul in the past few days?  Actually, yes.  Been doing lots of thinking, and I figure the past isn't worth holding onto if it's covered in spikes, and that not every situation is exactly the same...I had that prob for a long time, that and thinking that the world was yin and yang, a balance in everything...it doesn't. Some things are one or the other and the world is good with that, and after all, it your perception of a matter that counts, not whether the situation is innately "good" or "bad".   So that's mein philosophics for the day. Congrats to all the Latin/German peeps for losing Shinky, I'm crying right along with you, you lucky bastards! And good luck to all, and to me too, for this wonderful year.  And dudes...we have to do Firehouse again, who's in?

      BLAH, wellz every time I try to publish it gives me this weird error message and tells me the BLog is out of memory. Must be my LAN...it's also giving me the dumb publishing screen, where I have to press "Manage Posts", etc. when I want to look at another for reference. I have a feeling they do this when they're making some coding changes. But still...the other version looks fine to me, unless some peeps are doing really weird stuff with their BLogs and it's causing problems.  The Net is gay.  Happy Hellday all!  $|  Abby is coming home in practically three seconds, yay! That makes me incredibly happy, what after this downer of a day.   That's my two new words, "w00t", after the already-used and infamous word, and "downer", after the amazing Nirvana song of the same name, to describe the two ends of the spectrum of coolness.  I'm going to go run and kill myself now, peace aout dawgz.

      Yah Gunter really pushed the buttons this time.  In reply to Linds's post...well, to the one's that are directed at me:  1) aww woot, thx. And we know Rosie...never listen to me.   2) Cody Blonder? Stupid things?   3) I miss her MORE heheh, yes you are...well.....nah, I'll try to take as many bullets as I can for ya.   4) Entirely true about the caves, they're bitchin'.   6) No offense intended to John. A lot of people, actually, have been killed by murderers with a copy of this book, and I was serious about the murdering part. There was one part where Salinger talks about crushing someone's head and I felt really weird...so I wouldn't suggest this book to anybody, because there's really some unintended psychological effect that comes from it. Then again, it might be just some psychobabble placebo effect or whatnot.  7) "h4ck4ur$" is L337 for "hacksaurs"...actually, it should be spelled "h4ck$4ur$", I left out one "s".  8 (part 1!)) Yep, she was there, I think she quit high school or something and works there, she was really young. She was the cashier.  8 (part 2!)) That I did! That was me wanting to be black right thaar. And btw, Chingy is the best songwriter ever. The song  Right Tharr  has officially become my fav. song in the entire world and I'm going to be dressing in FUBU and speaking ebonics from now on.  (that is a  BIG  J/K for the slower ones of us)  9 (part 1!)) Jared for whom I have written a song? Good guy, he.  9 (part 2!)) AWW w00t frakkin' w00t. B-dayz=bitchin' no matter what, and two days of wait, bah. Actually, your b-day is on a Saturday this year, yes? So you'll actually have to take it on the 22 day because it's closed on Mondays. Actually I probably grossly miscalculated there...that's why I'm in Algebra II standard right now. Ya ain't a loozer, most of my friends waited a thousand years before they got their permits/licences (that was hard to spell)...look at Abby Mac, for instance. I got my on my b-day because I'm very anal about stuff that's cool. So yah.  Mine eyes hurt, all. I'm going to drink another Pepsi Vanilla (they're basically Vanilla Coke part 2, by the way) and pop in a movie.   And remember, "it's better to be pissed off than to be pissed on". Adieu friends.

Bold, italicized and underlined, of course of course...that's what happens when my ego balloon gets inflated to the point of bursting, I inflate everyone else's and we're all just a bunch of hot air, but boy, are we a happy bunch of hot air, heheh.

      Well Linds gave me an eight...C'MON LINDS! Thanks, but seriously...it was still a meld of all of the writing I've ever done and the "new writing" we're supposed to be doing...the kind that's very sure of itself and stupid, in my opinion. I mean, I just don't think it's right to opinionize on something and think of it as "true". What if you don't have an opinion one way or the other? Perhaps it's a hybrid of two opinions?  College=REALLY GAY. But Linds gave me an eight and I was incredibly stoked/a bit smug/highly disbelieving.    THANKS LINDS!!!!     And wow, on another note...I got PWNED last night...so did Abby and Kyndall and Chad, for that matter.  So here we are sitting in the park, fresh off listening to the worst jazz duet that hath ever drawn life into thine lungs, and the production is about to begin...for those of you who don't know, a troupe performs Shakespeare in Centennial Park every year. The whole deal is really huge and it's been going on for about sixteen years now. But anyway. I need to give a bit of background on the area.  It's a small, spraypaint constructed amphitheater...as in, there's a full-size, constructionized stage, but the rest of it is grass, except at the back, where there's some bleachers. So basically, you set yourself up within the confines of these spraypainted boundaries. These are set up so that the actors can walk down the stage, and so that they can store equipment in the audience and hopefully no one will touch it.  One of these pieces of equipment is a light display. It's a giant metal box connected to a skinny pole that has about two hundred pounds of lighting on the top. This, the stage lights, and another of the same kind of light at the other side of the area, allow you to see the actors.   In addition, there were some mounted power woofers on stands so that you can hear what's going on thru the power condenser house microphones on-stage.   Also keep in mind that the house mic is VERY strong and could pick up a cricket chirping a very long way off and make it sound HUGE.  So the play begins with the speech from the chorus, because it is Shakespeare and the play was Romeo and Juliet. Unfortunately for us, there's a big black storm rolling in from the north very fast. Not only this, the speech from the chorus is becoming increasingly more gothic-sounding as it goes to the point of fear. And all the while the house mics are picking up the most ghastly sounds of wind...I didn't know it at the time, but Abby and I both figured it was some effect they were using to make it more goth and stuff.  But there was a bed, and the curtains were blowing like no other. I thought it was a fan or something. Right before it all happened, tho, it got about ten degrees colder in about two seconds and I guess we all knew that the shit was about to hit the fan. It was  cold .  During recording, every once in a while, a wire will get exposed and create a distinct pitch of feedback thru every available speaker in the vicinity.   Remember those lights that I was talking about? At the end of the speech there was a torrent of wind like no other...the only problem was, we felt it as well as heard it, and in that same moment that little feedback came up and we saw the lights topple and fall smack damn in the middle of the crowd.  We were sitting pretty much next to them. The light wavered in mid fall and time stood still for a second, amidst the screams and monkey-panic of the moment. I think that someone got hit by the tail end of the light, or maybe they were just too freaked and passed out. But at least no one was crushed flat by the damned thing. But damn.   That's when we decided, "HEY, what a great time to leave,". I found out this morning that FIVE people were struck by lightning in the same area last night.  We had two choices, to stay in Nashville and duck it out, or to try and brave the interstate in the midst of the storm, and Nashville for that matter. Abby pointed out the fact that some people were heading to a building next to the Parthenon and it didn't seem like such a bad idea. But I figured we should just try and get through it all, like an idiot. Not that we died, it was just a trying experience.  So here we go down the mean streets of Nashvegas in pre-storm. It wasn't coming down just yet but it might as well have been; everyone was freaking out and driving like bums. So we whipped out the cellphones and got to it...we got separated from Kyndall and Chad at a red when I got trapped behind some bum in an Acura, and I would have pranced around the biotch and dashed the light had I not known Nashville drivers in general...altho running the light sort of would have made me one...but whatever, we were panicking, getting separated was really bad. So I called my dad and asked him what the hell I should do, he said stay on the street I was going on and turn right on the interstate. I was able to get over but first I got cut off...bastards.   I could try and detail the aftermath but I can't tell you in words about the drive thru that storm on the interstate...it was some fear I've never known. We had the radio on and it would flicker with every lightning strike, and the rain...I could have pulled over, yes, but I trust being stopped on the Nashville interstate less than I do moving on the Nashville interstate. I just follow the red lights in front of me and hoped to God we would make it.  I could attribute two things to my success. The minor one was Kyndall's incredibly sugared tea...it was really good. And I think the caffeine kept me just that much more hyped to avoid being pwned by that semi at one point.   And the other, and the major one, was having Abby next to me...suddenly she took my hand and I was moved beyond all reason with nerve and the want to defend her. I've never been so inspired to courage as at that moment...it was me feeling helpless and doing it anyway, because it was incredibly worth it. Not that we were going to die, but it was lingering about the doorstep at every second, you hear stories about it all the time. What could I say that could do justice to her in that moment, or ever? I love her.  So we made it and I was a wreck from all the concentration. I turned off the car and didn't put it in park, for starters. I had a Sprite when I got inside: it was ambrosia. Chad went out to the car and got the food we didn't eat at the park...none of it, in fact. Poor guy...it was his birthday yesterday, he wouldn't let us do anything. I offered to go get it, he refused, he said he wasn't going to milk it for everything it was worth...as if he milked it at all, for cryin' out loud. So that was really sad. Then while in the bathroom, the power went out. And thus begins another story. But not right now, for cryin' out loud.  For cryin' out loud.   What a great/weird night...I hope I never have to do that again, or if I do, I hope I have such good motivators.  I'm going to play the guitar now and write pretty songs about love and how good it is to be alive, and the next album has been renamed  Love Poem About Flowers and Rabbits and Sunshine , because one thing that that motivates you to live more than death is flirting with it and coming out on top.  And now that the mellodrama is done, I wish you all a fraggin' GREAT day. PEACE.

      Eek.  Today I had a Pepsi, of all things. I haven't had one in a few days, I've been drinking Crystal Light tea and water and chocolate milk, occasionally.   So today my dad said there were some Sprites in the trunk, if I wanted one (warm Sprite...gross, tho Sprite is pretty ass-bad, especially with popcorn!). I said no, that I had a Pepsi in the fridge and I was going to get it, since I'd remembered it. I drank it...I had a drum lesson, Katie went to hers and a lot of stuff got scrood up there (first we were too early, then we were too late, but she had the lesson anyway). But I eventually came home and DEAR GOD! The headache!  It feels like someone jammed a rusty knife up my nose into the left side of my brain, it's the worst I've ever had. So...  I think...  That's the end...  Of my caffeine drinking days...  YES I KNOW, IT'S REALLY REALLY WEIRD. What, me, master advocate of caffeinated beverages saying "Don't do legal over-the-counters, kids," But lordy, I shall never taste of this pain e'er again, so long as I shall live. So I give the brown stuff up.  Gunter was in our U.S. class yesterday, he came to say g'bye to Mrs. Bayrd last period, in case anyone really cares.  AND I'M AN OFFICE WORKER FOR MR. ADAMS! AWW W00t FRIKKIN' W00T! I get to grade all the little sophies essays and put comments like, "Gosh, r u dum, 0/9", and for all my little sophie buds (Trav-o, Jonathan, Sarah Heines), no matter what they put, I'll say "DAMMIT, i bow w/ supplication, 8107304912341/9". It's going to be great.  And for the essay in English today...what did you all argue? I said that it wasn't fair to blame the greater part of America for the lesser's sins.   Whateva. Peace bias.

      ALL WRONG!  I was reading Seventeen, all about hot guys and "Mya's Hot and You Could Be Too, If You Got Off Your Fat Ass!" and "Teen Sex Scandals: Three Hours of Labor In The Back Of An F-150". And other such nonsense! It was ASS-BAD! Hoo-ah! And there was an I-Zone sticky film advertisement where there were some awesome stickers for samples, one of which was "...in bed"...and that's it. I was going to honour my beloved fortune cookies and the Chinese culture in such a manner, but the adhesive wore out really fast and fell off while I was recording.  Hey, I recorded a song yesterday with the word "hoo-ah" in it. It was ass-bad.  LINDS, if you haven't all ready, don't tell Abby the "other surprise", I'm still gonna do it, I guess. And if you did, o well, it's cool.   I am SO TIRED all, I haven't been this wasted since...well, I've never been this wasted, I guess. ARGH!  Abby was at school today, YE-AH! That completely made my day to the fullest. And we saw Trav-o and Romeo tried to scare me but I yelped at him and he shied away, and I had a screamed conversation with Stephen Jones across the lobby, to the stares of some very scared froshies. And Mr. Kimmel came and shook mine and Abby's hands, it was so cool/weird. I saw him coming and I said, "Akk, I'm busted." But then he asked my name and hers and if I went to the school, I said yes, he asked how it was going and I lied, "Great," and he walked away with well-wishes. Aw w00t. P\/\/|\|3|).  I need to go record afore the sun goes down, friends. And if my secret calculations are correct, this shall be the last night of recording, as I have hit the mighty    EIGHT    mark, and that's enough for free pro studio time, w00t. I need to teach Alex all the songs tho. Downer. I'm going to try and lure him with beer, pr0n, and Mary J tho, so maybe he'll learn faster...thanks to A. Non E. Moose for this wonderful trick, heheheh.  And I'll have CDs (with cases, finally!) to give to all once I remaster and get a copy I like down pat. I LOVE IT AND I THINK IT'S GRAND. Some songs are like "whoa", other songs are like, "umm...you should really take some anti-depressants", and most are like, "this sucks". But the choices are up to you!  Until we meet again, here's lookin' at you, kids.

      Hoo-ah, boys and girls!  So...yesterday Abby and I set a goal that I would finish  two  songs today...a challenge! Tho it should be easy enough. So I woke up early, got distracted by some mags for an hour or two...yes, that was a slight impediment to the plan, and if you knew what mags they were, I would be that much more smack-worthy. But nevertheless...I went upstairs after that, I sat down at the set, I laid it out, and it was, for lack of a better word, and at serious risk of being deemed a poser, DIBBLE.   The song is a year-old conception once called  These Chains . Back then, it was a lot softer and geared toward the wonderful artsiness of  Bitter , but now it's been a bit revamped, it sounds like really old Soundgarden, but...  OMG IT IS SOOOOO L337! I couldn't believe it when I'd finished all the myuzik tracks, it just blew me away. So ass-bad, the only problem is the lyrics...I haven't written any I like. I tried sitting down and writing some, I couldn't, so I gave up and went into some kind of stupor for an hour and laid around and beed a bum, then something got me up and made me record again.  The next one's drums were done in three takes. This song has also been conceptualized for a long time and finally laying it down is a dream come true, even if no one likes it...even I don't like it right now (needs remixing), but it's amazing to hear the idea in the flesh, even if it is a bit retarded in its present state. At least the idea was true to form, that's what counts. So it needs a bit of redesigning, but after that, it'll be one more under the belt, one more towards getting that free stizudio tizime, and one more towards submitting the record to some execs that Alex's dad knows that have expressed at least minute interest in hearing what we have to offer.   The songs, in order of recording, are  Chained  and  New Dawn , by the way, and I'm going to go record another, if I can, in a few minutes...need to run first, else this gut get control of me.  So enough recording stuff, it's more fun when you're hearing watching/doing it anyway...  A point to make...everyone says not eating is bad because it slows your metabolism and will actually make you gain weight. Everyone's heard it and it sounds essentially believeable...it's logical to the biology of humans, anyway. What gets me is...anorexics don't seem to be having this problem. This is also the concept behind the word "starving", and the cartoon conceptualization thereby, where the character will tighten his belt to exemplify he isn't getting enough, if anything, to eat. So w00t, piss on science! This whole paragraph is just a reaction to the fact that I've lost seven pounds in the last two weeks and I have no idea why, heheh.  MTV is an awesome channel. Not really. There was a show on today about having "THE PERFECT BODY", which featured a bunch of prep girls and jocks that did inane stuff to get what they call "perfect figure". There were two guys...one was a bodybuilder, the other was a soon-to-be linebacker for Notre Dame. Then the girl, who was in a modeling convention where, honestly, she didn't stand a chance. One girl said, before the competetion, "I don't think they'll even be judging us on how we answer the questions, it's all about having a great bod, right?"   Right. One of the judges had the audacity to say "it's important that they answer the questions well and without hesitation". Oh, so is that why you made them walk to the awards ceremony in bikinis? RIGHT, their intelligence has a lot to do with that, etc. blahblahblah, and other cynicisms about this "pop culture" shiet.  But jeez, that show is really depressing. No one gets what they're going for...the bodybuilder guy placed third, he needed first to go pro, the girl didn't even place, the linebacker was thirteen pounds too light to match the smallest linebacker Notre Dame has had in the last five years. And the guy weights 280, for cryin' out loud.  The world is really gay, when you think about it. That's why I don't; consequently, this abscence of culture is good fodder for lyrical dissection.  That'll be one of those quotes that people will put in inspirational books for musicans, if not this line that you're presently reading, just because they're smartasses.  Anyway kids...need to go run. You've been an excellent audience as always, if you've made it this far, and if you skipped all the way down here, well, good for you too!  PEACE DAWGZ, AWW W00T.

      Ooh, I did the whole "drink chalk and x-rays" bit when I was about 4.  It's not fun.  But good job on the missing school part.  Abby had to get her blood taken between her knuckles.  Yuck.

      Whee!  Whee!  So yesterday we call the doc and my mom pokes me in the guts a lil' bit...they say ulcer, come in and we'll diagnose you. And they threatened some pills that would make me vomit up blood for about three weeks, during which I can only eat green...shit.   So today, I got in there right after school. Somehow I've become this uber-being doc model since I was last there...some sort of epitome of health...o except that hole in the guts thing. For some reason they ask a lot of weird questions these days, like GPA. They asked how old I was at least ten times, no joke.  But then...the doctor was prodding my guts and she happened to hit the very spot where it kills...it was a thousand thousand colours, it was incredible. So she said Upper GI (gastro-intestinal) for tomorrow...I get to miss school, yip!, well some of it...which basically means I get to drink chalk and get about three hours of X-rays in the process, so they can make sure I have something to talk about. And if I do, that means I've had an ulcer for the last six years of my existence, and I could see where that could have caused some of those stomach problems I've had over the couple of months.  NOT TO MENTION taking a topical medication that is highly inflammatory to the guts since about the same time! WHEE! So blah...I get to go to another clean place tomorrow, and I don't deal with doctor's offices really well innately. But then they say, "We need to get some blood work, 'k hun?" Little girly laugh after.  I haven't had blood taken since I was a lot smaller, before I was able to be stuck in the arm...and what worse, I don't take to needles more than I don't take to doctor's offices. And these people...for crying out loud...the blood room's in the basement, they already have Halloween decorations up...and they're the scariest frickin' things in the universe. And it smelled funny...much like places full of skin, blood, and piss samples will smell like.   But I have veins like tree trunks so it was all good. She stuck me with the biggest needle in the known universe, and get this: as soon as she started drawing the blood, I laughed. Sadist? I suppose. But I laughed out loud and she laughed with me, for some reason. And thusly shaken, I went to the bathroom and lo, what should be sitting there on the sink counter but a sticker! It's of a weasel, and it's from Canada! Huzzah for moi! Stickin' that sucker on the guitar as soon as I write my report here...ya know...the one for Calhoun that I never did...that's right kids! Doing it right now. I have to try and remember how many quotes per chapter, the length of the essay, and what it's even about...*cry*. But I just thought I should tell you all about my little experience and hopefully you'd all get a good laugh out of my fear of being impaled.  Bon voyage.

      Thanks for that, Linds.  I'm beginning to think that this whole Glen thing really isn't bothering me. Speaking of empathy, this has a lot to do with my resentments and inner quarrels more than that. My mother being there or not...there isn't much I can do about that. It's to the point that no matter what I say, I can't change a damn thing about her never being here, and I've come to accept that. It would have to come to the point of me failing a suicide attempt to get that attention. I know because...  Well here's where it gets tricky. I know this because of my  dad's  little deal back in ninth grade...he didn't give a shit either way about us in the midst of that wonderful rendezvous. When he broke up with that girl he even went so far as to  blame  me for it, to make me feel guilty and rub it in my face; that's how far gone he was...and that's a lot of reason why I haven't forgiven him entirely. This situation with my mom is reminiscent of that one; not that Glen is a bad person, but that my world is enveloped by him, regardless of what I think I can do about it, Glen is a part of my life and I refuse to accept him entirely...out of fear.  Out of fear of losing it again and going back into those wonderful days of rain and dark black and Slipknot and suicide and general fear of everything, want of love that wasn't there: finding a replacement love and finding out all too late it was the wrong kind.   I don't think it would be that drastic this time around...it's happened before, and I have some definite positive reinforcement this time around...but it's like being able to sense danger...it's an instinct. It's being able to feel the rain coming from a once-broken bone, to feel the hairs standing up on the back of your neck, to smell a gas leak and think "Peligro!" (en espagnol!). It's insecurity and it bugs the crap out of me.  But this is all going to go ok because I have Abby, who provides that love that so happens to be the right kind this time around, I have this BLog and all of it's wonderful inhabitants, and I have a self-assurance this time, I have learned that I don't have to kiss ass 24/7 just to have people like me: I have bad days like everyone else, fuck the ones who can't cope with the fact that I may just be having a pretty bitter existence at the moment.  I wrote all that because I was scared and I ran to the BLog looking for the answer...but the BLog can't come to the answers, only I can; we, ourselves, are the only ones that can answer our own questions and straighten our own affairs, we are the ones that need to decide the here and now. Advice is good for directing us at the right answer...but the fact remains, resolution is always better than vacillation.  JD (drum teacher) heard our CD today...well, mine. Stranglebox is genuinely falling to pieces. I'm pretty sure I'm letting go of Alex and trying to assimilate Nick...but that's another story.  JD first listened to  I'm Just A Bastard  after screwing with a few of the preliminary tracks, he just sat with his head down and listened. Then I started singing and his head darted up and he said, "I like that effect on your voice, man," and he looked like I had just started some f-ing revolution. He said to go to 4,  Painpainted , and noted that I was peaking out at first (that's a bad thing), but as the song went he started laughing to himself...he flipped out on this one. "Did you do the drums?...Yea?...They're badass...You're a really good vocalist, man...I'm digging those harmonies...You're an incredible songwriter..." and on and on and on.  And yes, I'm showing off a little. The reason this is really landmark, however, is that when he heard  My Solution  way back he was sort of unimpressed. He liked the way the song was written but it needed some serious work. This time he was bugging out. He about pissed himself during  Broken Me  in that cool little off-time drum section, and the part before the off-time drum section, and most of the song, for that matter. Altho he said it wasn't sonically "rockin'" yet, I'm pretty sure he was more than damned impressed by all of that. So maybe he'll produce us? That would be awesome considering the guy is a genius.  So I'm really tired and I hate making frickin' big posts, altho I know that every time I post I always make a huge one...sorry all. Kinda why I don't get on as much anymore.  But whatever. Here's lookin' at you, kids.

      I vaguely remember a friend telling me that  "...being a parent means putting up with some shit. Don't think for a minute that your mom (in your case, dad) doesn't know exactly what it's like; nor should you think that she [he] wasn't exactly the same at your age, because I'd bet nine of my own legs (and somehow I'd make that possible, but I'd win the bet anyway...keep reading) that she [he] was."  That advice really helped me out a couple months ago.  Thought I'd pass it back.  Otherwise, *hug* cause that's about all I can do right now.  I also have a slight bit of empathy for this situation, as all teenagers do, I must add.  Anybody that ever comes across this blog will be able to relate, because it's something we all feel, or have felt, perhaps not the same situation, but similiar feelings are derived, I have no doubt.  I got really depressed about that whole "giving your parents so much trouble" topic back in June.    As for the whole thing with Glen...there is not one thing I can possibly say to make that better, which is really odd for me, cause I'm usually good at that stuff.  I've never had to go through anything like, nor do I want to, but talk to your mom, I guess would be the best thing I could tell you.  Plan to take her out to dinner one night or something so that you have some time with her if that's what you think you're upset about.  Don't sacrifice your mother's happiness for your own, but at the same time, don't sacrifice your happiness for your mother's.  Get your feelings out there, or one of you will end up resenting the other if things do get more serious.  *Hug*

      You are perfectly right, Z. I could probably safely say we derive our angers from the same source, albeit in different ways, but it is all the same, nonetheless. But it should be ok...either you adapt or you die, whether you witness it or not.  But anyway..."pwned" is the L337 (a Counter-Strike language) version of the word "owned"...notice the "p" 's relationship in position to the "o". It was misspelled so much (and I probably just mispelled "mispelled"...eagh) that the kids adopted it. Thus, the holy word, P\/\/|\|3|). Some people are able to type whole sentences like I just spelled "pwned"  really frickin' fast .   So anyway...here's lookin' at you, kidz.

      So sorry to hear all that, Josh.  I can't imagine feeling like you do, but somehow I think I have some kind of fraction of empathy here somewhere.  ;)  If you want to talk, e-mail me.  By the way, what exactly is pwned?  I must have missed something somewhere during my leave(s) of absence, because I thought it was another strankuba typo.  ;)  Bye, all.  ~Z

      O not much Z...the usual insanities. Getting pwned / etc.  And now for something wholly depressing. And that is, not having a mother.  Well yes, I do, biologically, in that she, in fact, did give birth to me and still has a pulse and respirates.   But the problem lies in Glen, her "boyfriend", I suppose would be the term...akk not for my mother, heheh. But yes, that's the best term. So the dillio is, she's been going out with him every day for the last three or so weeks, not getting back til the small hours of the morning. The other day she had Glen pick her up and left me the car and her bank card, so as to get money so as to be nourished. Which I did, in having Wendy's, which was really good.  It started out nice enough, and then it just spiralled out of control, I guess.  It's not that I don't like Glen; I do. Not that I really know him, but I don't see anything bad about him immediately. He's got a lot of money, he doesn't call me "sport" (I said I would de-spinalize him if he did, right off, along with "tiger", "ace" and other such diminuitives), and he was the dumped one in his last relationship, when his wife cheated on him and his evil empire of money (well, not "evil", per se, but it sounded good) collapsed and he was left...not in the dregs of poverty, really. He had enough to start over and has. He's insightful enough, and moreover, he's not an asshole, and that's always a good thing.  So all that good junk, why am I so pissed?  It's not like I'm so dependant on my mother for everything, it's just the abscence therein that's causing me some pretty heavy grief, and it shows in the way I write stuff. This all came up when I was suffering PMS (Pre Monday Syndrome) yesterday, and sort of made me think of things the way they are for a change (my world is my own, a little euphoric bubble of unadulterated bliss most of the time), and I must say, I didn't like it.  One...my dad. And he's reading this but I don't really give a shit. It's mine so blah. He's been really sick lately, some kind of bug, he's having heavy debt problems, so much shit, and somehow I've never been able to muster much pity. It's been this way since Becca, I haven't been able to be kind with him for very long. My mom once said that "once someone's broken your trust it never comes back". I attributed this to why I was always angry with him until the day I discovered that I am the only one that can make my world better.   I never tried to, though, to make it better.  And yesterday I asked him to come listen to my CD in my room. He laid out across the bed while the first track was going, and I went downstairs to get some tea, then I came back up and stood in the doorway...he didn't hear me come in. He was looking at his hand and he kept flexing it and looking at it, for the duration of the song, mostly (5+ minutes, I guess). I came and sat down next to him after a while.  He then told me that he was "so blessed to have such wonderful children who would help him through all of this"...and then he cried, silently but I noticed, I always do, but this time....I couldn't take it, I just couldn't stand the fact that he referred to me as so good when I feel like I harbour such hate and mistrust all the time. And then I looked into his eyes and I saw the lack of sleep around them...under his eyes was a heroin-wasted purple and gray, like he hadn't slept in years, and the eyes themselves, bloodshot with tears and long nights awake.  That picture stuck with me, and his words...his unshakable faith in me, acting like I'm such a great person while I feel like I don't even give a fuck half of the time...all of this has worn me down to the point that I made a great long emotional post (been a while eh?).  I fear so much that I cannot control. I fear his dying, I fear losing my mother, I fear the school as much as I'd like to say I fight it and win all of the time. Most of that fear came with watching Linds feeling blown in fourth today, hearing the schedules she keeps up. Been having such  wonderful  dreams lately...one about Abby that was funny, other than that, I've been dissected and forced to watch, raped (that was a weird one), I've had to bounce around a city because every time I jumped gravity would lose it's force...the problem was the landing, which actually hurt in the dream, and that gut-wrenching feeling you get while being thrown around on a roller coaster to boot. The endless homework...it isn't bad but for crying out loud, I'd like to have a life...not that I'm going to do it anyway, but lives=good.  So now that I've been a post-adolescent baby once again, I feel a lot better...thanks for putting up with this as it comes all.  Ciao friends.

      Apparently lots of things have happened since I was last here.  Will gave me a 7 on the essay, in case you care.  I suggest that if you want to know why I'm so freaking PISSED--Linds, you already know--look on my LiveJournal.  Machinery sucks.  ~Z

      Why Will, not that I seek your blood...argh, no. I was just thinking the other day..."Man...where's Will?" And for all intents and purposes, thou wert dead. But now you're back and it's definitely you, with one of the better Rosie slams I've ever heard, I about had an aneurysm when I read the "make concessions" part and I still laugh out loud when I do read it...which unfortunately for me, since the cool "I can see the posts and make one" format of the BLog is up, I'm reading it every minute and drawing ever closer to said aneurysm.  There's a whole situation, really? Boy howdy, I'm feeling left out.  And Linds understands exactly what I meant when I said  97 Oligarchy Pie Amongst The Burning Corpsed Doo-Wah?  I swear, she's the only one left among all of us. And not a sarcastic cowgirl in the least. Heheh.  Guys!...  I'm pregnant!  Some background...I  hate  Papa John's pizza, I think it's really gross. And I  hate  Grape Faygo, I don't like grape carbonateds most of the time. So...guess what I had for din-din tonite? Some of you may need rocket science degrees before figuring this one out.  I'M PREGNANT! At least I hope so, for crying out loud. We went to get a movie (and I really need to give a note on that in a second), and there's a Papa John's right next door, and it smelled really fraggin' goot for some reason, and I turned to my dad and said, "Let's get some frickin' Papa John's" He hates it to, but he goes, "Ok," So we did.  And also...Gardetto's snack mix kicks major ass. And whilst walking around Sam's today with father looking for the most random shit in the world (baby wipes and ant traps...put down the hashpipe, dad!) I came across the LARGEST BAG OF GARDETTO'S IN EXISTENCE. So we bought it, and here I am happily indulging every rye chip I can find, and, of course, being a little candy ass and downing another great can of Grape Faygo.  I hate my life, it was a boring day.   But I wrote a bunch of new songs!  Gutter Ballad ,  Tainted ,  Asphyxiate ,  Into The Outside , and finishing work on Abby's song, which she has so tenatively titled,  Abby Song ...well it had a  The , but I cut it off for intrigue's sake...I hope she likes it, the song. It sounds nice...it's one of those like Jerry's that are really nice and I could sit around and play for a few hours and like it better each time I hear it. And that's weird from me, cuz I hate most of my own stuff after a while. Cry. And...I'm no poet so the words probably are really really sappy and I'll just sit here going, "Well isn't that nice, heheh."   Augh.  I'm so tired it's not funny. Here's lookin' at you, kids.

      that's a good question, why am I dead?  Why can't we kill Rosie instead of me?  I also agree that it would probably be best if Rosie kept her mouth shut, however I realize the  impossibility  of that and am willing to make concessions.

      Why is Will dead?  And has Rosie talked to you about that whole situation?  And if she has, she needs to keep her mouth shut. (Love ya, Rosie!)    Of course that made sense, Josh, why wouldn't it... I knew exactly what you were talking about...yeah...

We're the only ones talking anymore on zis BLog. Sigh.  Will is dead for all intents and purposes too.  Well that's alright, because  97 Oligarchy Pie Amongst The Burning Corpsed Doo-Wah?  If that made any sense to you, you need to get your brain recolour'd.   I said that because I need to get mine recolour'd too. Heheheh.  Here's lookin' at you, kids.

      O my, I didn't notice how flagrantly I said, "and because my mom will be marrying Glen sometime soon." Heheheh.  No, not really, but I figure as such by this point. I'm still puzzled as to why he hasn't gone and be'd a loser and sprung that shit up already. Not that we've met him...he doesn't even come to the door to get my mom, he calls from behind tinted windows on a cell phone. My mom says the reason we haven't met him is so that "You don't get too attached in case things don't work out." I mean...ok. We'll get attached, sure, because I have, let's see...no girlfriend? Nope, I've got Abby...no friends? Naw, lots of good friends...no biological father around? Hmm, I've got that too...so THAT, friends, is exactly why I would become attached to him and the separation anxiety would simply be too much for me and lead me to death.  ...  It's all just so dumb.  Well I didn't go to school today. Hoo-ah! I've been under influence of Quil du Ni all day, and it was wonderful. Great for dreamless sleep. I'm pretty sure I'm already biologically addicted and I'll die without it tonite, but I already feel pretty durn good, altho the acetaminophen takes a long time to wear off with me, so I dunno if I'm actually better or the drugs and doing what the bloody hell they're supposed to be doing.   I watched  The Two Towers  today...:in a word, "Eh." In another, "It's alright." And another, "It was ok." Perhaps another, "I've seen much better." Et cetera. Ok, all that BS to say, yes it was dynamic and huge and totally captured the feel of the book...shakily in places, as it always has done...but...the acting in this one wasn't half as good as in  The Fellowship of the Ring . Maybe since Ian McKellen wasn't around all of them at the same time to whip their asses into shape, because he is an ass-bad soldier. But eek...it was some rough acting. And what happened to the battle sequences? Yah they were large scale and heads rolled and stuff...but they still paled in comparison with the first one. I think that with this movie, they aimed for size, and boy-o-boy did they get it. If not anything else, there's a lot of frickin' extras in this mofo.  Well...I'm going to go do something else to waste my time.  Here's lookin' at you, kids.

      Diet? I wish, I wish. I'm seriously about to dip below 150 for the first time since I was in sixth grade...that's loco. And the best part is, I'm not doing anything at all. Probably another growth spurt. Abby can tell you the vocals have been cracking like a mofo. I just ate about a thousand pounds of cow, but I know that I'm going to wake up tomorrow and be 149.5.   Don't get ulcers or ulcer-like things, kids, they're bad and they make you want to take opiates so that you can eat without getting killed.  I set things on fire tonight! Boards and stuff! We did hardcore racing trixxx with Seth's 30+ MPH RC car. Remember those remote control cars that used to be so cool? Well they've been advancing the technology on these suckers...they can top at about 70 MPH now. The only reason they can't go higher is because the frames aren't strong enough...the torque twists them to pieces over a certain point. But it's seriously the coolest thing in the world watching a little RC going as fast as a street car.  They have races for this kind of thing, so Seth and one of his friends started the "L337 Racing Team", and I got drafted today, so I guess I'm in. And since my mom is going to be married to Glen sometime soon I'm going to milk him for all he's worth and get a real frickin' expensive top-of-the-line RC and just take it out on weekends and make some money with it.  Glen...  Rraugh.  Well, I won't be an EMO kid and trouble you all any longer. I was at Seth's and Abby called and I missed it, and now it's past 9:30 so I can't call back without getting busted...and I've caused enough trouble today....so I'm going to go cry in my room now and pretend that I don't hate myself.  cheers, mates

      I did again today...I dropped another pound. Wowwie.  That's really weird considering I've been eating nothing but junk the past couple o' days...it's been fast-food central. No mothers about to feed us. And I'm sick...allergies I think...and that really uber sucks. And I have to do homework, too.   Wow, life is cool   Well, except for Abby, of course.

      Well so fars...  The bloodwork says I'm ok...no malignant tumors or anything like that. That was nice to hear.  The X-rays haven't come back yet, or haven't been processed, or something. The doctors are liking to be lazy. But that's ok because...well I dunno why, but it's alright. I can't have any caffeine (sadness! not that I drink it, but sadness!) until the barium gets processed, else it hardens in my intestines and I die! W00t!  And also...I'm getting sick! And that's never a good sign! At least now it's reasonably safe to assume that I can drink peach tea again. And eat chocolate chip cookies...that's the staple food around here for the day. Hoo-ah! Altho I lost another couple o' pounds overnight pretty much. I was 156 with all of my clothes on...that's about 153 in reality. So today, with shorts on today I weighed in at 152.5...shoes and all. That works out to 151, about.   But enough about all that. I'll probably be getting the reports back on Tuesday, that way all of you can determine when to make fun of me for eating nothing rabbit food for three weeks!  Here's lookin' at you, kids.

      As are most days here recently.  I'll teach you piano.  I want to play guitar.  We can swap.  I'm dead serious.  I do want to learn guitar and I'll pay you by teaching you piano.

      And today too, it seems, Linds.  Welp...(as in "well" with a "p") It's all just really gay. It's not hard to notice that we're dropping like flies in front of this year. Think of the wowifical nombre of posts all the BLogs have been getting lately...HMM. I wonder why.  Man, I was reading the archives to all the BLogs the other day...what nostalgia. Good times, friends, good times.  So I'm sitting here and I'm really hot, because I cut the grass a second ago. And with me, I took a portable listening device called a CD PLAYER, and took the wonderful band LINKIN PARK with me. It was great, I haven't listened to  Hybrid Theory  in a long time. But anyway...I was listening to  With You  and I decided...I need to learn every instrument possible. I was listening to the turntables thinking, "Damn, it would be awesome to blingity bling on 45s," and all the sudden I was stricken with a fervor of, "Hoo-ah!" So's this should be fun. I really want to play a harmonica, but the piano would be nice, and I've been threatening violin for a long time. So we'll see.  But I have to start scratching soon...more about practice than learning, 'tis. Just to be proficient in every field possible. w00t.  Nonagons and nuptuals, friends.

      Augh, I get the cool BLogger in Nashville, I get the gay one here. WHY?  Aww well...whadaya mean I'm not an EMO kid? The long hair, the screamy, "I wanna kill myself because nobody likes me" songs, the generally nihilistic life outlook? I've been working so hard for the EMO kid just to get it all ripped away...SADNESS. Heheheh o well, I guess I can go back to being a little geek now.  I wish they had strawbaby flavoured schtick when I was a kid, I hated the grape...ugh! I think I mentally linked it with being sick and thus, cannot stand it, and I was sick a lot as a kid (if I remember right) so tharr ya go, arr.  This weekend was really weird. I hope it's the caffeine, but I feel really normal for a change. I'm normally feeling really panicky and thinking the world's going to blow up if I don't take control of every aspect of my life 1234897/7, but for some reason...hum. I got out of the car today and I thought, "Wow, I feel different." It's weird because it feels like I'm not going to be so freaked out over stuff anymore but at the same time, I'm afraid to not be panicky and paranoid and stuff, just cuz I've been doing it for so long.   And wondering how it's going to make me think about interactions and stuff. It all started with something my dad said..."I haven't talked to Laurie in a long time, since her mother died..." And that was it, but it reminded me of how I used to think of things last year, and so I asked him the questions I had always wanted to hear, and the first one was, "Do you hurt?" and then he answered, and I asked "All the time?", and he answered. And for the whole ride I tried to sort out his problem and it was so fucking hard...it reminded me of how I used to be, totally hopeless and living every day like it was a nightmare. That still carried on, albeit a shadow of its former self, until today.  I asked myself this weekend if the past was really worth holding on to, and if what I recall as the past was really, truly "the past", or just some pain-painted coverup my head made up. But the answer was: "What does it matter, it's not like it's coming back."  I feel so weird...I guess it only happened because I found out my dad was just like me, trying too hard to impress everybody...it works for a while but people figure it out eventually....else, they subconciously do and look down on you for it, either way. But it's my own father...  Eh, I dunno. I'm really torn about what I'm stumbled upon here and how it's going to affect everyone around me. It's not sadness...I've figured out how to handle that, and grief and loss and all those wonderful malevolents...it's the masked sort of fear that forced courage conjures up, it's conquering a new world even tho I've been there before.   It's confusion. It's knowing that I can be comfortable here and not being able to settle in, and wondering why I still have to beat myself up. There's you an EMO kid trait...the simple fact that I have a BLog bears testament to that.    My sister just said the following stuff and I typed some of it down, and I thought I should share   But then you're not thinking about it, it's just like, "Eh". She was like, "Wow, you type incredibly fast." Ha, Dusty, I have you in a body...block! The world is fucked, we're all gonna die! Josh, you're a loser! (after seeing that I was typing everything she was saying, and wondering why I wasn't talking back to her)

      Wow, my head hurts. I've been watching movies.  I was supposed to talk about them last night but then I got sidetracked by being pregnant...he's/she's doing fine, by the way. I drank two Mountain Dew LiveWires this morning...they taste suspiciously like orange freeze-pops. And I like them too. I was an orange fan, but never grape...something to do with a bad experience with Dimetapp.  So, the movies....   Basic  was the one I watched last night. Wowwie. That was a really frickin' good movie, you all need to see it. Augh...it really really screwed with my head. When the credits started rolling I was sitting there shaking my head going, "No, no...that's bullshit." YES! That's how good it was. And it has some pretty big names to overshadow the smaller ones, but the smaller ones do take some precedence...not that that will get them anywhere in their acting careers, but still. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, HOO-AH! It was really good, and if you want a movie where, at the end, you're shaking your head going, "No, no...that's bullshit," this is the one.  And today, just a few minute ago actually, I watched  The Animatrix . If I'm not mistaken it came on MTV for a while. It's a collection of  nine "cartoons" essentially dealing with aspects of  The Matrix , and there was a lot of shit said about it, but I don't know why...it was cool on about a thousand levels, two in particular. Firstly, it had incredible storylines, and as a sub-cool, they all dealt with aspects of  The Matrix  that  Reloaded  couldn't quite make clear, or other things that weren't explained. They explain programming errors like "ghosts" and "haunted houses" better in one nine-minute short than they did in the whole "anomalies" bit in  Reloaded . They also discuss a lot of things that were left to our imaginations after the first two movies...the machine's takeover is explain, that curious little line in the first one, "It was us who scorched the sky," is explained. It actually justifies the actions of the machines and the actions of the humans thereafter, and it's basically a classic tale of neverending eye-for-eye, still prevalent in ideals like "human rights"...nobody is happy with living the middle ground, they always have to be on top.  And the second level of cool that's worth noting...the animation styles. The first episode,  The Final Flight of The Osiris  is totally 3D, a la  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within . The rest are varying forms of Japanimation, which, if you like anim, you'd be in love with these. They took about a thousand different directors and put them on different projects, so that they could encompass a different form in every episode...it was totally cool getting all those different perspectives on animation...and yes, I am one of those little anim fanboys, surprise! O well...back to what I was saying....granted, the last episode is little more than a great big CGI experiment with a subplot of little relevance to boot, but in general, it's worth checking out. If not for the "Now I get it/ I'm a  Matrix  geek" bonus, there was some good story telling and pretty cool/gross animation.   And now that I'm done rambling you can ignore this post and pretend like I'm not a total loser with nothing else better to do than BLog about movies and be an EMO kid.  Here's lookin' at you, kids.

      Thanx Linds! Everyone has heard that joke and thinks it's dumb now, even tho I'm sitting here laughing really hard every time I think about it. Sigh. But you laughed and that's awesome.  It's Saturday, yah, but even that is waning, making life horrible.  Yes, I live with all girls, and in context, PMS stands for PreMondaySyndrome. It's massive depression marked by the onset of a new week, mostly on Sundays but auspiciously clear in the slow points of really good weekends.  My dad almost got robbed today. He was asleep and the back door was open, then he heard movement and screamed, "HEY!", and whoever it was ran out and slammed the door...nothing was taken. It's also all my fault since I took Katie to Guard this morning and, in our hurry, we left the door unlocked. I felt horrible, and still do, considering. Of course, da doesn't care.  He also just happened to come across a copy of the movie  Memento  on Friday, so we're going to watch that here in a second. Just happened to, mind, I didn't even tell him about Psychology, and suddenly he goes, "I got this movie called "Memento", it came out awhile back..." And then I told him the whole plot of the movie, the life story of the guy, his brain damage, his credit card numbers, and other cooler stuff, and dad was just sitting there going, "Uh...that's cool."  I drove about a hundred miles today, it was badass. I went to Opry Mills and bought a really cool toboggan, which happens to be really cool, albeit a plain, black colour. Guess whar I got it from.  And I heard CHINGY on the way home, and I cried when he said, "POKEchop." It, too, was sweet.   Y tu mama, tambien. OOH BIOTCH. Heheheh. That's the name of some Latin specialty movie I always see in the new releases at Blockbuster, even tho it's been out for the better part of two years. Just the fact that it says, "And your mom too" is really frickin' cool. It would be even better if "biotch" were attached on there, too.  And...the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza from Domino's is...eh. It's ok. It's a bit hard to chew. It also tastes weird, like...part pizza, and part philly cheese steak. It makes for an interesting conflagration. Not to mention my intestines are screaming for death cuz of all the grease thereby.  Caffeine ist bad. Reichstag. And other German stuff.  Farewell friends.

      Arr mateys, again. Heheheh. This is the bad joke that I wouldn't allow myself to tell on Linds's, but here it be.  So a pirate walks into a bar and he has a steering wheel sticking out of his fly. The bartender looks over and gestures at the wheel, saying, "'Eh there, you know you got a steering wheel sticking out of your fly?"   The pirate says, "Arr mate, I know, and it's drivin' me nuts!"  Arr! Heheheheh. I heard these on the radio this morning, in lieu of Speak Like A Pirate Day being revered by the Bob and Tom Show, and I had to share because I cried when I heard them. Plus, every five seconds or so, Bob and Tom would stop the show on account of a rousing bout of "Arr!"s. It was so [sic].   I'm eating some sort of nasty breaded plant and noodles. Oh, what is wraught in the name of sustenance.  Anyway, the weekend is almost over...this is kind of a bummer. Feel that PMS coming on already.

      The most random post on this BLog ever...the prize goes to Rosie. "CHACK?" Rhymes with "CRACK" which is wacha been smokin' RosiePosie...heheheh.  My hur ("hair" in Chingy speak) is in a ponytail, is very pretty, and smells vaguely of Herbal Essences.   Are there anymore vacancies in the "I Look Like Crap" Club? Because I really need to join. Imagine a train wrecking into a plane with a nuke going off in the center of it all, and that's how I look today. Not sleeping much and having to wake up hella early is bad, and makes one look like crap, especially the male side of the species since we don't tend to like to cover it up with such wonderful devices as "makeup". Of course.  Except Johnny Depp was *BADASS* with eyeliner and shadow...I'm seriously going to do that for the rest of my days. Look...Layne Staley did it, Trent Reznor (tho I don't like NIN but Trent is a badass too) did it, Johnny Depp being a badass pirate did it...I need to do it.  Abby expanded the triad of the godly hierarchy yesterday, from a triarchy to a quadrarchy. Jesus Christ, Jerry Cantrell,  Johnny Cash , and Josh Chandler. Hahahahaha. Abby has synapses firing like no other to have caught that...heheh, she's awesome. It's too bad that the Chandler one is going to fail at life and at school. Heheheh.  O man, I told y'all.    A GIRLY-GIRL. You dont have a lot of self-esteem and people are always bringing you down for being sad. What do they know, anyway? You feel like youre too mature for your age and are frustrated by the trend-followers who refuse to accept you because youre not like them. Your virtues: Intelligence, understanding nature, modesty. Your flaws: Lack of social life, inferiority complex, timidity.    urlLink   What kind of girl are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

I typed it fast and in fading sunlight, in a really akward position because the chair I'm sitting in is broke and it forced me to pull myself straight and stare down at the notebook which I wrote the sucker in, which is also irregularly placed, double-forcing my redesigned posture.

      Rosie, you're right, she probably did.  Linds, you're right, I did and it was good. MLK conjures up a lot of bad shit most of the time. Except it smells like popcorn in there constantly, and fresh popcorn is a really frickin' cool smell.  It'd be nice if our school could have more of the commodities that MLK has, like popcorn machines and junk. Altho ours looks a lot less evil, almost bleach white in comparison.  Speaking of...I wanted to post my "Truants in the Hands of an Angry Principal" lecture, and see the rest of y'alls too, this being a gathering of the most diabolical minds in all of the English classes, I would reckon. So, here goes...  "How is it that my untamed wrath could ever be questioned Behold!, I am the scourge of your kind, and you are but fodder for the machine of my dominion, the harvest of my malice, and the beacon to my hate. Your furthered existence within these halls is naught but a testament of my mercy, yea! I hold your souls from that precarious edge of expulsion as a debt to the gods of patience. But, weary my arm but a trifle, that closed protal that saves you from the perdition of exile and shame, and lo, shall I drop you and invite such demons of failure to feast upon your paltry, blighted souls. Think you, your purpose here, be it one of choice? Nay! Your time in my realm has been forced upon me, and may I be smote by the fury of the cruelest stuff of creatoin if I do not maintain the mask of my authority! It has been written: no flesh, no excuse, no thing of man or nature born may save you from the blood-blackened blades of my endless power, nor shall they lesssen the price of your sins. Hear my words! I am Logosian, I am both North and South, yea East and West, and every step erstwhere, I am your redepmtion and your executioner, I am the silent imminent in every conversation, every echo and bump when you may earnestly believe your solitude secure. And above all, my thirst for the flaying of young fleshes has yet to be quenched. Behold!, I am Principal Harshwords, demigod in my own accord, above all with the iron gauntlet of my reign bearing the contract of your soul tight within. Hence, let no man step forward, or may he ever be contained in the crucible (bonus points!) of my fury, ever a depiction of the eternal advent of my anger."  I thought it sounded rather dumb so I wanted some suggestions, if anyone would care to give them, and I want to read y'alls too so gimmie.

      Ok, so imagine a shaggy drowned rat.  Now superimpose that image on a 16-year-old with long hair and you have...a bizarre genetics experiment. But no, today I remembered why I hate recording by myself so much...I'm the only one to get pissed off when things go wrong, and TRUST ME, I get plenty pissed off. So I was absolutely screaming in between takes today while recording...something...and sweating like no other because the fan was off and the vent was closed...so as to prevent that wonderful audial entropy called "NOISE". But that still didn't stop the cords from getting crossed and making a wonderful 128+ dB hum called "FEEDBACK" that also qualifies as "NOISE", expect I was using "MIC LINES", and "MIC LINE FEEDBACK" is so much worse than, say, "AMPLIFIER FEEDBACK".  Sorry for the biting sarcasm all. This is me pissed off and trying to catch my breath.   Not to mention the wonderful waste at MLK today...trying to get my ring back. I didn't, if anyone didn't get that earlier post. So I was incredibly pissed off today, but I did get to see Chloe and Boy at my dad's so that was frickin' AWESOME.  Man...every time I go to MLK I lose a bit of my rational thought for a while. Like, right now I'm trying to remember all those wonderful phrases I normally use, but I can't. Like "OMG that is so L337". There's one, but still.  End result: I hate my life. A lot. And my anorexia is saying "don't eat anymore" but I'm going to, by golly, because I'm frickin' hungry.   Anyone who hasn't heard the band Cold hasn't come to be yet. You need to hear something from  Year of the Spider  and your life will be changed forever.  RAAAAAUHGGGGGHHH. So pissed! My cat is in the other room meowing his head off and I want to go and KILL him. And that isn't normal, friends, most of the time I just don't care. But today was a downer so there.  Bon soir, amis. YES.

      YES!   BLogger format has changed for a while...this always happens on Sunday. Huzzah, it won't be like this for long, tho.  So, I was looking around on IMDB and I found out that Jerry Cantrell was in  Jerry Maguire , with one line and everything. He was  Jesus at the CopyMat , or so  urlLink IMDB  says.    AND THE INFAMOUS LINE     "That's the way to become great, just hang your balls right out there."       JERRY!     That's all friends. YES.

      Damn.  Comcast ist being uber slow today so I can't see the pics for which toe y'all got. But that's ok, cuz I'll see them tomorrow, since I know I'll be on the computer a bit more, if not a lot.  You are almost correct Linds, he is the second cousin, only  thrice  removed. Well actually...in doing the research I had to wade through a lot of debate over who started it all, Wundt or Fechner, and surprisingly, it's pretty evenly divided. I think Gustav laid the foundations, Wilhelm built the house.   Gosh, you're right, it says "preschool teacher". Maybe I'd be a craaazy one like in Billy Madison and have all the kids put on tribal beads and do Hindi dances with me, so as to exemplify my in-touchness with emotion, thus not losing the EMO kid side, and also listening to Metallica while we dance, thus, not losing the rock side. It would be fun being a preschool teacher, four year olds are pretty cool. Kids are pretty cool in general, actually, unless they're not under my remote discretion and they're, say, in a library, and I don't have the right to go up to them and play with them or do something to make them shaddup. Then they're not really that cool. But I'm totally diggin' the preschool thing. That would be solid. Jive turkey!  I've been watching "I Love the 70's", and it kix major assor. But Abby and I agree the 80's are better. Think: big hair! Poison! Ratt! Sex, Drugs, n' Rock n' Roll: The Era! And on a more serious note...Metallica! Early Alice! That's really it to the eighties, music and sex. And lots of political fiascos. And Apple IIs, those things are the SHIT.  Well...a neighbor is selling their 1999 Acura Integra for 10 gs, so I stopped over to look at it, and it kixor assor. It's got a subwoofer in the trunk, and the guy said it can lay the track flat, if needed. Heheheheh. At least it has airbags, by god. But...mild structural damage, as in bad paint scratches. Judging by the people selling it, they probably won't haggle. But I'd try for 9.5 at the least.   Hey, it smells good in there too, which is a lot better than I can say for the last couple o' used cars I've been in, ala GAM, my dad's. It smells like butt in tharr.  Whoa dudes, caffeine is awesome. I haven't had any in a long time, but we ran out of stuff to drink so I perked some coffee...well, it was perked so I put it in the nuker and it was really good. Cinnamon crumbcake with hazelnut creamer. It's all gone now tho...HAHAHAHA. I don't know how to use that pot, thank god. But I think I'm going to go try and figure it out here in a second. HAHAHAHA. Caffeine is awesome.  So's...anyway...god, I hate that. Like, I'll be talking to someone and I can't think of what to say next, or else I've forgotten. I do that a lot, and it really suxor. DAMN.  Mega recording tomorrow, that should be funfunfun til our daddy takes the T-bird away.   Well, I hope you all had a good day (mine was good, albeit lethargic and melancholy) and a good one tomorrow too. Because life is puddle wonderful. Heheh.  Salut.

      You've posted a lot today.  I didn't know anyone influenced Wundt, him being the father and such.  Perhaps Gustav is the grandfather?  Or maybe the godfather.  No, the second cousin twice removed!!!  I'm going to have to give that one some thought.  It says you'd be a good preschool teacher.  Which is funny, given that you're other choice is a rock/emo star.        urlLink Which toe are you?

      Thank god Comcast is working and all.  I'm really hungry, and I don't feel like cooking, and I don't have a car, or any money, for that matter. This, friends, is the paradox of our time.  I was drumming a few minutes ago. It was really awesome. I also discovered that my room is warm no matter what you do to it, to the point of being unbearable. It's that wonderful yellow, God bless it. It just makes me so warm inside that sometimes it sets me on fire. So it was really hot and I feel like I just got run through a SCUBA gear-less tour of the Titanic. But it's fun pounding skin. So yes.  I think it's time for a nap all. Golly, do I love weekends.  Sigh.

      woohoo!  Doing some research schtick. This isn't very fun. Fechner blinded himself during his experiments, that's about the funniest part to this project, he was looking at the sun trying to "gauge the intensity of the sensation".  Thanks for eliminating yourself from the gene pool, Gustav!  Anyway, I recorded a new song last night, and I must say, my sonic skills are going up a bit. It's interesting that they are getting better, since I've haven't recorded since finishing the last song of the "really bad demo"...just been reading on it a lot and thinking of how stuff could sound really cool if I went just a bit overboard.  That would explain why I used about four different mics on one acoustic, and two on an amplifier (that's not so bad). But it sounds really good for an early cut...I'd go so far as to say, some of the better sonics I've ever done.  Woot! I'm going to take a break from stupid research now, because it's really gay and I hate it and want it to be shot in the face and foot simultaneously with a projectile weapon. And I'm almost done too, this guy is really frick'n popular. He influenced Wundt, if that says anything.  Salut, mes amis.

      O wow, I just noticed how incredibly complicated the world is.  I mean, you hear that's it so big all the time, but it never really occurs to you or pops out in your face. Like, you think that someone is getting murdered everyday, but you don't hear about it, you might even ignore it like me because, hey, people die, and others will be assholes and kill them...unless it's something overly shocking, like Tabitha Tuders or something.  But...I was looking through that list of recently-published BLogs today, I sampled the EMO kid non-professional ones, that have the ".blogspot.com" after their names. I read about a girl who's car was almost stolen and she was freaking out, I read about an overweight college guy with depression he probably doesn't know about yet, I read a lot of hate and brokenness. As much as we all are divided, I suppose we really are all the same.  And that is the extent of my insightfulness for the morning. And now some good ol' fashioned DEATH psychology, w00t! Gustav beckons.  Farewell friends.

      The song is called  Tainted , it's a nice pretty song with really icy vocals, until the breakdown screaming at the end of each chorus...hence the name, the "taint" kicking everything's ass.   And then there's the bridge part, where that starts up in the left earpiece, and then it's followed by a screaming reel after four times of the line. And in the other ear, the line is spoken, and then a nice rap reel. All the while, guitars chugging it out in the background, Alex is pounding our very skins off of our bodies and...I'm...playing the bass, as usual, but yea. We're really proud of this biotch, actually. It's in the CKY/We wanna be an EMO band genre.  Speaking of, on the way home, Abby and I saw a license plate in which the first three letters were EMO.  I am SO stealing that guy's car! Even if it is a horrid life-sucking gas guzzler!  Anyway, I'm going to record s'more right now. I have to pick up my sis at 12 at school so...yep. It's right behind me in the bathroom, I might as well.

      I like what you did with the line.  It doesn't apply to me as much as the other though.  What song is that going to be used for?  I like the whole "hey, look at me, I inspired a line of a song of a band that's going to be famous" thing.

      Wow, did you guys know spiders can buzz?  I just found that out. There's a huge spider living on my front porch, and as I went to run today (I just got back, so that can tell somethings about the darkness factor) I got caught in his web and he landed on me. And proceeded to buzz. It was the scariest thing ever. I screamed like a very little girl.  Well, that's ok, cuz my dad is coming back in a minute with new headphones! Yay! Get to work on a little acoustic side project I'm doing for my aunt...plus a few other songs here and there...that might come to light very soon.  Linds, I adapted your line...it has become, "The anger from without becomes the anger from within." It leaves a bit to think about, but it's part of a reel that's really awesome moreover. That's the screamed one in the left earphone, altho that bit is whispered four times before we break out the heavy shite. So, considering the rest of the song, the left side is the despair/screaming part, the right side is the aggression/rapping part. And they go together in my head and sound AWESOME.  But yes, the anger from without becomes the anger from within.  Hoo-hah! G'bye friends!

      That is true, I was thinking about it not being a solstice as soon as I got to school today, and thought, everyone is going to hate me. But it wasn't that bad, now was it?  And just kidding about that math major all, jeezus. I hate math, I'm just good at understanding it.  So if everyone couldn't tell, I'm in a bit of a mood, and that's never good. Most of the time, I develop these little things and they tend to bleed out on everyone else. So yah.  The rest of this post is going to be what is known as a "rant". Linds's BLog is called as such, and it reminded me that I haven't ranted or used the word "fuck" on this BLog in a long time. Not that I expect that anything will have changed by the time I have ranted or used the word "fuck"...to the greatest ends, no less...but I'm wanting to do this so that I'll feel better.  And again, I'm mostly expecting everyone to pass this part up, seriously. I mean, BLogs are really meant for talking to yourself, especially the EMO kid side of every BLog. Not that anyone actually does...what can you really say to these kinds of things?   So that is the disclaimer, and if you're going to keep reading (and I promise there's nothing special, and there won't be any names used, not that I'm pissed at anyone anyway), be my guest.  So...I hate myself. As hard as this is to really accept, I hate the way I've been wired, which is, in essence, myself. My family has a predisposition to the worst kinds of mental deaths, the least of which is depression, which is a constant and horrible knife in my back. It ruins every function of my life, relationships, grades, ambition. A couple of weeks ago, I was probably on Cloud 9 about this time, and a few weeks before that, I was probably sinking lower and lower as I took the labours of breathing.  The point is: I can't control it, and I can't understand it, and neither can anyone else. It helps my maturity and sense of humour, when I'm not in the middle of being depressed...other than that, it's a curse.  I can tell when it's kicking in. I'll always be in the middle of a sentence, and I'll start to trail off and lose interest in what I was talking about, or I'll be trying to say something I find funny, and just drop the reigns on it. Then I'll start to really loathe myself for how I'm becoming and it'll only get worse and worse as it goes.  Speaking of maturity, that shit drops off pretty fucking (that was the first one) quick. I make the dumbest connections to why I feel the way I do, and why people are reacting differently to what I say. Fuck (and that was the second one), I  know  why, but I still sit there and worry about it, knowing what the hell is up.  I like psychology because it lets me know why I feel these things. I don't like psychology for the same reason. It lets me know why and reflect on what a commonplace freak I am.  It's not the common part that gets me. It's feeling isolated and knowing there's a thousand people with the same damn problem...it feels selfish, and giving to that selfishness is something I have to do, but it makes me feel horrible nonetheless.   So I deal with it. I spend time alone with it, I cry about it when it's bad enough, sad as it is, I just don't know what else to do sometimes. Suicide typically always occurs to me, but not as a reality...as in, it comes up, but I never consider it in reality. And the saddest shit is, it happens everytime, and that's horrible. I hate thinking about it.  Honestly, life is really great right now, and that's another reason why I hate myself. I mean, everything is so even, I have the best girlfriend that could've ever been imagined, I'm doing ok in school, I have friends, I have a decent family.  Oops, I found out that someone is doing better than me in something, time to get depressed! Oops, guidance people say you need to get involved to get accepted into college, I'm not! Time to get depressed instead of getting involved and actually doing something about it! Start thinking, you're too stupid to get in on intelligence, you're not going to know what to do on the essay, you're going to fail anyway, so why not just quit and  kill yourself now  before the rest of your life does?  And THAT, friends, is shit. I don't like thinking that way, but inevitably, I do.  I keep waiting for myself to make some faulty association between two things and depress my brains out because of it...fuck. Just waiting and waiting, knowing that I should stop waiting but I can't. It's depression.  It's sad because, chances are, I'm going to be schizophrenic in the very near future...in case you didn't know, that's going to really fuck me over. It's happened in my family, it happened to my biological grandfather (who killed himself, by the way) and his grandfather (who also killed himself, if I'm not mistaken)...I'm a prime target for it, or something to that effect.  I mean, come the fuck on! I have a life to live here!  It kills me to watch these guys who don't care about shit, who langour in infidelity and debauchery, and they come away morally scot free. How the hell? A piece of me wants to be that whoring fucker that I detest so much, sometimes. I figure I wouldn't be depressed.  Then I get to be normal again, and say to myself, "That would be more depressing, living that way. And killing yourself is a bad thought, so I'll  never do it again ."   So when it does happen again I get really fucking mad at myself for having lied. If I were to tell a bit more about my past, you would find lying to be a great and murderous part of it, the likes of which I would aspire to damn from my being, but no...I lie to myself to make things better, despite my knowing that the fix is always temporary, no matter what I do. Just like anyone else.  I aspire to be my own person, and that's definitely dampening that. Imagine the struggle trying to recover a sense of self after Leigh Anne. Imagine the fear of becoming that lost self  again . It's terrorous, even. It's worse now because now, I would know what was going on before it happened and find myself not able to stop it, again. At least, that's what I think. But I'm in "pretty down" mode as of now and of course, every thought that comes out is a negative one.  Most of the time I write these things away...I can't this time, for some reason. It's like all the music was taken out of me, and here I am, left to die with these wonderful little chips of anger on my shoulder.  Just now, I typed, "I HATE I HATE I HATE" and deleted it. But that's just a part of my ID longing to come out, just like he did before, when I didn't really care.  I'm trying to keep this under raps guys, I really am. I didn't like what I was last year, and I'm fighting it with every single fucking bit of my essence. And that creates a lot of negative sentiment at the same time, which I am forced to fight with simultaneously.  I wish I could describe this all to someone, but it's one of those things you can't put it to words if it's true enough. It's like love, if you really believe it, you can't say it, you can't even show it, you just know it's there, and it's real, you acknowledge it and you deal with it the best you can.  But even those that provoke the best of my words (and there are no names, but you all can probably deduce, if you're still actually reading) couldn't draw all this out, I've made it too complicated and I'm fighting a war that shouldn't have ever started, against myself.  It's a horrible war, having the entire world on your side, every confidence you could have ever asked for, and somehow, just somehow you're losing that fight, you're dying fast, you don't know why, you won't. At first you think there's an answer and you go looking for it, but actually, there never was a question, so you're reaching out for something that's not there, and that's where your constant depression comes from. I've since staved that, now it just comes back in sprees when it wants to.  I just hate the way it makes me feel and interact with everyone. I feel it taking a toll on my life. As if everyone couldn't guess where my thoughts are now, going to that primarily important and strange and new aspect of existence.  It is my fear that this will take its toll. That only drives it onward.  So that's about it. What more could I say? I fight, by God, I fight, and I hope that some day I'll understand all of it. I'll keep praying for a solution, I'll try to hold on to my loves and passions without letting the depression taint those too.  I just hope I can stay true to that chivalry.   Wow, that's quite a lot. I hope you didn't read all that, because you'd be just as much of a loser as me for writing it all for no apparent reason.   Whining is good within reason. Hell, you're mind produces things typically horrible for your body, but does it with reason. We should all be adhering to that wonderous natural logic.   This is the end. I'm going to bed now. Goodnite all.  I feel much better, by the way, if anyone couldn't tell, or cares at all, if you were worried at the suicide part.

      And it's an equinox, not a solstice.    Sorry about the headphones dying, but yay! about acing (literally, as to boost your self-esteem) your algebra test.  You may be a little too right brained for the math major though.  I'm a big fan of Algebra II (in comparison to other maths, quite obviously), though NOT Ms. Stout, nor Geometry.

HOOAH! It's become my favourite diminuitive! So everyone, join the crowd and be a cool person!  I should be a math major, algebra is easy to understand. Geometry sucks, but o well.  So I need to go do some annotation. My headphones gave up the ghost as I was trying to record today. Sigh...can't be a good artist without good gear.  So that sucks, and life needs to be set on fire at times like this.  Bahamas dimes are really cool looking, I have one here and I should show you all the thingy sometime. It's BADASS!

But anyways...did anyone think about who the real loser is in that story? Morally, sure, the boy faces the guilt of losing the sheep. But what about the townspeople? No wool, no...other sheep stuff...all because they had so modified their outlook on the "boy" that they didn't bother to come check what he was bitchin' about.   Someone should redo that wonderful piece of folklore and tell about the massive economic backlash that struck the parentals thereafter. Sure, the kid's a biotch, but shouldn't it be their duty to come look if he says, "Wolf?" Who gives a kid a boring job like looking for wolves in a sheep pasture all day anyway? Who's to blame for that one?  Those stupid dingleberries. Heheheh.  ABBY IS SICK! I hate myself and I want to die...augh...such sentiment of depression therein. WHY, to her, of all people?  I'm sure she'll be better in about two seconds tho...lordy, am I an EMO kid. Heheh.  Farewell warriors.

That's good tho, that you in fact are 16 and have the quiz say 16. It shows, like...stability in your life or something. The fact that I got 6yo tells me: 1. I have some maturing to do, 2. I was looking for answers that I liked, not my real answers, which ties in to maturity, or, 3. I cheated. Since 2 is the most thought out answer, I think I'll go with that.  YES!

      Wow.  So what a strange yet wonderful week of suppressed e-conflict.  The only problem I see with BLogging is that it detracts from real interaction. It's so easy to just leave a message on the BLog and forget about it. It makes us live our whole inter-social lives right here.  Which, in some respects isn't such a bad thing. Hell, there isn't any noticeable emotion behind words, unless you're using the strongest kind ("I fucking hate you and wish you were shot"). Is it any wonder that I hate getting online, and thus, never do? Altho that doesn't stop me from BLogging, which is the paradox of our time.  BLogs are like the little journals I intend to keep but never do. Plus, they talk back, or at least, this one does. Getting perspective on any situation is good, even if it is a bad perspective. If there's one thing a bad situation can teach you, it's what  not  to do next time.  Or it can teach you humanity and how things work. Or both, mostly that, actually.  Or it might not teach you anything. Or it might teach you the right thing, but you go about learning it wrong. That's what happens when you get to be, what most people call, "screwed up".   What's really amazing is, though the ultimate goal (for lack of a better word) of life is death, life teaches so much before we go. It's incredible that nature would allow itself to exist when it will certainly die. Including God in this factor, and it's not surprising. But from the godless atheist viewpoint, thinking that nature would weed out the weak, it's surprising that nature didn't weed itself out long ago.  Maybe it expects us to do it for it.  How freakingly Goth is that?!? Did you notice I put it on its own line, for emphasis, too?!? So Goth!!! Notice I'm using more than one end punctuation?!?! WOW!!! NOW ALL CAPS?!? WHAT IS THIS?!?  I almost typed, "what is this shit?". Did you all notice that "this" and "shit" are the same letters all mixed up? I notice this because I was trying to type "this" and I had a Freudian slip and typed "shit" instead. Cool.  So after this largely irrelevent post, I must bid you all adieu. But I had to put that little irrelevent thought in my little irrelevent pseudojournal. How irrelevent.  I am irrelevently yours.

      So then the question becomes: how is he supposed to prove it to you?  And really, is it even necessary that he does?

      Will, thanks for the words of advice. Really.  Ok Linds. True I haven't met Michael and true I haven't talk to him. BUT I've seen how his actions miles away have turned you upsidedown. I really don't want to see that again...I don't think any of us do. That is why I'm so against you being with him. I know I shouldn't attack you...I tried for the past couple of weeks but I'm not exactly in control of how I feel. Anyway, basically sorry that I'm constantly attacking him. Oh yea...I don't trust him...not until he proves himself that he can be. Hope everything turns out ok...

      all you have to to is tell them you are under 17 and they dont have any more questions  Lindsey, I believe that you are the best person to judge wether or not you should trust him.  If you want to listen to other's advice that is your decision.  As for me I will trust  you , and if you trust him, i will too.    Rosie, i think you need to take the advice giving course again.  The best way to make someone do what you want them to do is not to attack them and cause them to defend themselves from you.  Additionally, that method causes people who might be on your side to back off.  Just step back and don't get emotionally involved.

      THANK YOU ROSIE.  I'm not really understanding the conflict here. To quote, even if this is a bastard thing to do: "...you know what I meant." Which means that there's some underlying conversation that has yet to surface.  I mean sure, it's hard for a good part of us to get over Michael-bashing. Just read the backlogs to the BLog. Hellacious. We tore the shit out of that guy.   I don't really know what to think of the whole thing. Half the time, it's like it was the first night all over again, remember Linds? I sat there cooking chicken, going, "No fucking way!" I still catch myself doing that sometimes.  Speaking of time...I think if we give this some time to ease its way out, it'll be much better.  And if it all comes down on a bad note...fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  And stuff.  I wonder if I take this fucking stupid 15 minute survey if it'll go away. This thing is really annoying for some reason.  UPDATE: It's not going to go away, and what more, I can't take it since I'm sixteen. I mean, I could. But I don't want to because this stupid advertisement won't go away even if I do, so I'd rather not waste the time. What would improve BLogger is if they took away the assholemachine 15 Minute Survey Thing. RAGH.  UPDATE 2: HOLY HELL. It did go away. I went to another BLog, and it's gone! YAY! I'm impetuous, yes. But it worked so HELL YA BIOTCH.

      You're right, Josh, there are reasons to look over my shoulder, and I do, to an extent.  I'm not completely blind as to what's happened in the past.  But, I think I know him a bit better than you do, Rosie, as does Abby, given she's actually talked to him before.  And since we both approve, I think it's ok.  Not only that, but I think I can judge for myself who is good enough for me.  But, if you would like to talk to him, I'll give you his number, and you can see for yourself.  That might solve some things.  Then he can defend himself and I won't have to do it anymore.

      ROSIE, you still haven't answered me. Bygolly I'm the administrator, YOU SHALL OBEY OR YOU SHALL FALL.   I like the word "atall", it's partially Ye Olde Englishe. It'se sweete! Helle yesseth!  As to being worthless, or good enough...I figure Linds wouldn't continue to date someone a thousand years away if he wasn't good enough, at least for her. Perhaps we have cause for misgiving, but that's no reason not to have a bit of trust.  My mom made a point the other day, that when someone breaks your trust, it's damn near impossible to get it all back. I dunno if I like the idea but it seems fairly reasonable on some level. Like, they may seem to get it all back, but you'll still be subconciously looking over your shoulder.   Unprovable, yes, very pessimistic, also a yes. True? I think so, as sad as that is. Trust is one of those things people look for to survive. If someone has stabbed you in the back before, what's to stop them from doing it again? Circumstance, yes. But should there ever be a great reason for us, doing no wrong, to be betrayed by those we trust in?  Rhetorical questions are awesome, but they haven't been effective since "give me liberty...". I think people have just become too smart for that kind of persuasion. Or too stubborn to think, rather. In any event:    This is the end of the post

      And he did remember, by the way, which surprised me.  So there.  Not worthless atall.  Yes, that was meant to be one word.  Atall.  Accent on the first a. So it's ah-tall.

      Will, abrasive as usual...heheheh.  Well...I randomly showed up at her house after school (after "assuring" her that the 30th is not a day of importance, tosh!) with her favourites...daisies, of course. And in three colours and three of each, of course. And I also gave her some chocolate covered cherries and blueberries from Starbucks. And then we had a "boring date" until I had to go and get Katie from Color Guard. It was an awesome day...she's so incredibly wonderful.  You never answered my question, Rosie...why are you "observant"?

      Rosie, she is allowed to date whomever she wishes, and her love life should not be your concern.  Please allow Lindsey too think for herself.  Additionally, I see no trace of the "HE'S SUCH A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!" anywhere in Lindsey's post.  (in other words shut your pie hole, Rosie)

      1) ok, as soon as I get enough time.  But I have to leave here in a few minutes.  But it's kind of depressing.  But it's my very favorite. 2) I didn't get to watch it today :( 3) I realized this after I posted.  Sorry I forgot.  Today is me and Michael's 2 month.  As if he'll remember.  Yeah...  So what did you do?

      Rosie, how are you "observant"?  And to Linds, in accompanying list format!:  1) I would like to hear it, since poetry rox my sox. 2) Wasn't it good? G-ma was watching it too today, it was thuroughly enjoyable, if at least to laugh at. 3) Aww frickin' W00T you have your license! YE-AH! Today was mine and Abby's 3rd month anniversary, that's why it's special.  Everyone dressing up tomorrow? It's going to be AWESOME! Umm...it's "belt and shoes match", right? I thought that was it. What about the tie, does it matter? I don't think I'll even read this again before you all see me, but I thought I would ask for future reference, or to laugh at myself thereafter.

      1) I've got a better poem, but I like that one.  I'll post it when I have the time. 2) Trading Spaces is awesome.  I watched the 3:00 episode, though. 3) Why is tomorrow as special day, besides me going to get my license?

      Hope everyone is enjoying Trading Spaces...it's on right now!  I have it on in the background, coupled with the smell of heat and running water. The heat in this house has a smell, and it's really frickin' nice. And Katie is running a shower and it has a really nice sound to it. So that probly means I'll be hitting the sack here in a second because I'm really tired...and tomorrow's a really special day.   If Abby happens to be reading this...NOTHING IS GOING ON PLEASE IGNORE THAT LAST COMMENT...heheheh.  Well, that's it for now friends, I hope you enjoyed the wonderful poem.

      Why surely, Lindseyreid.  I have rediscovered the greatest poem ever written, and I thought I should share it with you all. This comes from the greatest book of poems ever written,  Reflections on a Gift of Watermelon Pickle... , and the poem is called  Poets Hitchhiking on the Highway . Let's read, shall we?  "Of course I tried to tell him but he cranked his head  without an excuse I told him the sky chases the sun And he smiled and said, "What's the use." I was feeling like a demon again So I sad: "But the ocean chases the fish." This time he laughed  and said: "Suppose the strawberry were pushed into a mountain." After that I knew the war was on-- So we fought: He said: "The apple-cart like a broomstick-angel snaps and splinters old dutch shoes." I said: "Lightning will strike the old oak and free the fumes!" He said: "Mad street with no name." I said: "Bald killer! Bald killer! Bald killer!" He said, getting real mad, "Firestoves! Gas! Couch!" I said, only smiling, "I know God would turn back his head if I sat quietly and thought." We ended by melting away, hating the air!"  Wasn't that great? Life is really cool now.  Later, friends.

      "To say that the human spirit is nothing but mere calculation is to make the spirit something of flesh; while it is comforting to think that ourselves can be manipulated through the work of the physical, it is, as if to say, we carry our souls in our pockets and apply them as we see fit."  That's from my paper, and I thought it sounded really slick, so I posted it here, hoping that when I read over this BLog in the future I'll see this and go, "Man...that was slick."  I can't hear anything, I've been recording all day. Aaaah. But it sounds pretty good, except for the vocals, since I couldn't hear myself sing by that point.  I drove the Acura today, it was sweet. They gave me the owner's manual to look at, it's awesome. I going to bug my mom to death now. HAHAHAHA. I must have it. Even she said, "It'd be nice if you had you're own car," and I said, "Yeah, it really would, too bad I don't have a job," and she said, "Oh." YES!  And a Happy Antiphilanthropist Birthday from me to Lindseyreid once again, as I hath done on The BLog, and for what it's worth, since the name of this BLog basically entailed a "not-people-person". Whee, HBD!   It's time to go and do...something else. Until we meet again, friends.

      Nobody's reading Ralph, I don't think, except for me two weeks ago, and then I got bored. It's a really good book, conceptually, it's just boring as hell. I'm annotating the sucker for kicks, it's a job...but it's pretty quick, I'm thinking.   I thought you said you were, I was looking for you but...to no avail. Mind, there were about a million people so I didn't try incredibly hard, but I had my eyes open.  I'm thinking about a template change, not the standard ones that BLogger provides, tho.

      Better her's than, say...Huddleston. Fun!  Were you at the game, Rosie?  I must say...that was a horrible game. I remember why I don't generally go to them...because I jinx them. The last game I went to was a Vikings game. It went into overtime and we lost, just like we did tonite. My very first Bruins game, and a decisive one. We had that fucker in the bag, and guess what? Franklin pulled some shit in nine seconds. Everyone around me was saying, "Hell no, Franklin will never do it."   They missed the extra point, we got the ball first in OT. We were killed in the field goal, and then they kicked one and got it...their very first one of the night.  Everyone was clearly defined, teamwise, after the game. I was the one standing way up top giving Franklin the bird.   On the way out tho...I had calmed a bit. I was still fucking pissed off...hell, I still am. But I was cooling down, driving by the buses, giving the Franklin bandies the "evil eye", which they returned and being pretty amicable, in general. And then, one of the buses starts up the chant, "Bend over, Brentwood."  Fuck, I dunno why, but that was the shortest straw. I think it's just the fact that they're a bunch of redneck assholes. Maybe some latent fear of being anally raped?!? But all the same, the window was down, and I made clear my feelings on that with a mid-based finger. Someone yelled, "Franklin rules!" to which I yelled...something not very nice. I made up a lot of things too. I must give myself one thing, if not a lot of things: I am a proficient swearer. Tonite became the advent of so many interesting phrases, I could do verbal battle with a sailor and pwn his @zz.  So. I'm going to bed. Today was a really bad frickin' day, because it was raining. I ate lots of chocolate, but I guess the seratonin pumps decided not to work. David Stanley also made some pretty fucking horrible comments today about Abby...I'm playing football at his house on Monday. Rest assured he's going to fucking  die . I don't care if he's not being serious. There was a line, and he crossed it. And that was just further depressing, and more than just a bit angering. Like...I spontaneously combusticated because of the intense anger.  People on fire are funny.  Irrelevently yours.

      Hahaha. Well, good.  Aye, and US History. I have that done, for anybody that hasn't yet. Me being a big old overachiever finished that stupid packet in due time. So yeh. It's on the table.  Linds, if you read this again, remind me to ask you about something in English tomorrow. If you remember. I've been trying to and consequently, forgetting. So if you do, that would be awesome. It's not dire, by the way.  And even if you don't read this, maybe I'll remember making this post, and will thusly remember?!? Probly not.  I like the "?!?" thing at the end of sentences. It's really goofy.  Also. I have two songs stuck in my head that suck being there. There's  Miss Independent  by Kelly Clarkson. Which is bad but not as bad as the other one. The other...it makes me feel like a slut.  I Wanna Be Bad  by Willa Ford, or someone like that. It's a really slutty song. And everytime I think of it, I feel like a total whore. Go look up the lyrics if you'd care to divulge my pain. They'll probly be on some porn site somewhere.  Irrelevently yours.

       urlLink The most random post I've ever seen by any human ...go on, click on it! You know you want to. It doesn't make sense until the end but...for cryin' out loud. It's the longest post I've ever see, that's for sure. I got outshined by a longshot. And you'll know which one it is, believe you me.  Life has become pretty painful as of late. I got blood drawn today and they really tapped a good one, apparently...it's never good to hear a nurse go, "oops" when blood is flying out of an open vein. But I got patched up in due time...my hand is a little tingly, I'm hoping that's my hypochondria.  I missed more US History because of getting that ol' blood drawn, I'm going to fail.  I've been effectively cut off from my girl for a while. That inspired "the worst day since...all of last year", or so Linds will tell you. So if I seem like a limo wreck in the next few days, this is probably why.  I was effectively told, "We don't know what the hell is wrong with you, sicko," at the doctor today. They said they're going to do a test in two or so weeks, and if that doesn't show anything they'll be putting me on some new seratonin productive drug and giving me a pat on the back. But that would be ok because, 1: hell, it's seratonin, how tricked is that?, and 2. the test I have to take, which will take all of seven minutes, requires me to take opiates for the pain and some kind of "valium, which has hallucinogenic and barbituatory properties" (direct quote!), which will effectively floor me for the better part of the day. YES!  Then watch me wake up with an addiction to opium and I die from the strain thereafter. Hell, I took Nyquil two nights ago, I'm already addicted to it.  I had a lot to think about tho. That was another factor for staring at the ceiling til two in the morning. That's also why I looked like a limo wreck today, or at least a sport coupe wreck, rather. Not so bad as a whole frickin' limousine.  Ok, stepping away from the BLogger teat.  I am teatfully yours.  And did you all notice that "Rosie Jiang" and "Lindsey Reid" both have 10 letters? Don't ask me how I found this out, it would be too hard to put words to.

      And you reminded me of that little phrase as well as you got back together with him.  I suppose it does. I just have some of those philosophical qualms about the end of real human interaction, etc. Not that any of it matters in the least.  Well...sometimes when you log into BLogger and look at a BLog and leave without posting anything, it will make a post with nothing in it and post&publish it...and a couple of minutes later, BLogger notices the error and deletes it. But I think that Will was here and when he left it made an invisible post, which I bore witness to. Go to   urlLink the site via the Internet  to check if it's still there.

      So, good. One more week down. That's another line I can gouge off my calendar. Remember the ones we got from school? Weeks are being gouged off as they past. It looks like a zombie-thing, it's badass.  And I haven't made a long post in a while, so I felt compelled to do so. Let's begin.  Familial problems springing up again. It's hard to explain where they're all coming from. You think you have a feeling beat, but it decides to reincarnate and spring up on you. If I hear one more thing about Jennifer I'm going to kill myself.  School's ok. I passed US History, I can't complain. Barely, mind. But I frick'n did. The test damn near gave me a seizure at first sight, but it was alright, as well.  I had fun last night on a treadmill, and about made my heart explode. I even fell off at one point, I don't think anyone saw tho, except my mom who was right next to me. And I was simultaneously watching something really smutty on VH1, but I couldn't hear it since my headphones weren't working. It appeared very smutty.  But I kicked the crap out of a punching bag while I was there. And had fun with a medicine ball. My mother made me sterile with said ball, which wasn't too thrilling...she overthrew just a bit. At least I made a funny deflating noise as I was unusually castrated.  Altho today I was reminded of the little plastic baby I had to take home in 8th grade. You know...the ones that cry and you put the keys in their backs, et cetera...and I was forced to wonder if maybe it was a gift that I was rendered incapable of reproduction. But no. It didn't happen, nor do I hate children or not want a family someday.  My hair is annoying. I've been thinking about getting it cut a lot lately, but knowing that I won't. I just wish the bangs would grow a bit more so that 1. I wouldn't have to trim it to mullet length for a while so as to get bangs, and 2. so that I could have a ponytail, so that conversations and consuming wouldn't consisting of me spitting out hair every three seconds.  Yesterday was the 25 year anniversary of Pope John Paul II. THE POPE!!! In Stout's class today, someone wrote, "The Pope is Dope!" on the board, and Julian stapled a sign on her message board that reads, "Got Pope?" I have one of those signs, it's going in my room somewhere. I feel bad for John Paul...he's probably the last of the fully pious left, and he's about to buy the farm.   To the best of us...  I've been trapped in my room lately. Mom's on the phone all the time (a serious hinderance to Abby Time, by the way), and Kate's always on the computer until really late, so I never get to use it anymore. Not til the weekends, like right now.  So that pretty much means I sit in my room and think my insane thoughts and go crazy. Man, the last couple 'o weeks have been frickin' distorted. Seriously. I even scared myself with the writings that have come out of me lately.  Like, my mom actually came out and confronted me with being anorexic...that was some shit. I was going, "No..." But it would be just like me tho, wouldn't it? This is my struggle-free year, but this year I get to set myself up for the fall next year, plummeting into the depths of anorexia and madness. Yeh, let's hope not. A lot. I'm really not too keen on dying at the moment.  O well. I think I had more, but I thought about it too much, and have thusly forgotten it. I've been thinking of doing a gargantuan post all day, but this is the best I could do. Too tired. Too many dreams and "old man moments", where I wake up way early for no reason, and stare at the ceiling and think of random stuff til the alarm goes off.  O well again. Irrelevently yours. (and if you all would like to post about your current stati, feel free, it's not like we really get to much spill it anymore)

      David Stanley is a cool character. He says he wants to rape my girlfriend, "sodomizing with a telephone pole" among other, horrific and impossible atrocities. Abby knows, and she thinks it it quite funny. It is quite funny, most of the time, because I end up kneeing him in the guts. I kicked him in the head once, it was awesome! And in the chest, which was cooler, because he made a really weird "uuuhhh" sound when he was deflating. It was BASS!  I went to play football with him because...well, think about it. I would have got to kick his ASS! It's too bad he wasn't there. O well...have to resort to popping him in the face with my backpack like I did when he said something mean last week. That was pretty cool, I think he bled a little. At least...I hope.   Don't worry , this situation is well within the span of my control.

      We have it because, at the time, school was a really good idea.   Hell, back then? It was a great idea. They taught you what you absolutely needed to know to be "educated", one 'o them "smart folk", say.  Now, since America is such a communist state, manipulating the lives of all of its children, they've inducted this "policy of higher learning" used to make us "well-versed" in every aspect of knowledge. While it might be a good idea, some people just don't give a shit ( see, for reference : Josh Chandler) about that other stuff.   Teaching style has never been that great, either. They seek to teach, not to imbue, us with an idea. I find it to be the mark of a true teacher when you can apply their ideas to your own life versus reciting all the facts and psychobabble within each subject by rote.  That kind of screws math, but...it's math. It's all conceptual when you get high enough up in the ranks. Plus, I don't like it. I can do it, but I don't like it.  Irrelevently yours. What a post, just to one question.

      Katie's listening to a song upstairs right now, and I think it's Mariah Carrey or someone like that.  I actually like this song musically. It sounds really...epic. If I could, I'd like to write a song like this. One that just kicks you in the back of the head and makes you want to wail. Or maybe I'm the only one that does that.  Yeah, but I really would like to write an epic sounding song. Too much EMO kid in me.

So my conscience would suffer greatly for my gain.  Altho it did hurt like a be-otch. Or at least I think it did. I can't remember. The amnesic was really good. Could I throw in memory fraud?!?

Actually, doublesigh.  I wish I had a camera. Like, a good one. There's a shedding tree across the street and I really want to capture it in action. Lest I have to wait until next year.

      O sick! Ok then, I feel better. I tried to punch the doctor but I could only managed a feeble flap of the arm. That was in response to my thinking, "Shit, I'm about to choke really bad," but I couldn't do anything because of how under I was.  O yes, the amnesics. I actually remembered all of yesterday. The biggest rememberance was that of wanting opium. Fuck, I've really been wanting a hit all day. I told my mom, "no opiates" but nobody's listening to little old me. So now I'm addicted to smack with no obvious or forthcoming relief.   As to the amnesic: it's weird. I have little blank spots in yesterday, I try really hard but I can't remember what happened. Most of it is centered after coming out of the hospital. I remember burping a lot and stumbling off the curb once in front of a dumptruck. It was parked, so I can't give the "I almost died!" excitement.  That excitement should be reserved for the GI room where I died. It felt like dying, anyway. Or looked like it.   Oh. The opium. OH.

      That's ok, Josh.  When I had my surgery in 5th grade, I punched the doctor right in his gut.  He called me a "little slugger" and walked out of the room, probably to get some pain meds.  They have drugs to make you forget things?  I want one!!!

      Bah.  I feel simutaneously really good, and really really bad right now. The drugs! They were great!   But I woke up too early. God I'm tired. I don't want to type this all out, so I'll tell the lot of you, if you really want to know. I must say, I didn't know I could use the word "fuck" in so many simultaneous contexts. Not that I remember. It was all "Id". I remember waking up crying and calling the blood pressure machine a "stupid, stupid bitch", to which my mom, who was right next to me, smiled and agreed. Apparently I had been cursing everything quite profusely before the drugs wore enough that I was able to take control of myself again. I even looked up to the doctor and called her something to the effect of a "stupid fucking whore". She laughed. Doctors.  And right now, I'm feeling really out of it. I laugh at the most random shit. I can't think worth shit. The only things I can think are "eat eat eat", "pain pain pain" or "nothingnothingnothing". Well, I might be thinkin a little more than that, because I made this post.  The sad this is: they gave me an amnesic, to help me forget the proceedure, and while I did, for the most part, these things have an effect on my dad's side of the family of wiping our memory for the entire day. I feel like if I apply myself I might be able to remember what the hell went on today. But, chances are, I'm going to wake up tomorrow, get on the BLog, and wonder when the hell I posted the day before, or, for that matter, if there was a day before.  Alls I know is: drugs are really fucking good. Heheh.  No, really.

I should join the martial arts club for that one.  Having injury on the right side of your body is a constant reminder and testament to how right handed the stupid world is. Like when I tried to turn on my right handed shower and landed on my quite skinned right knee.  Right-handed capitalist pigs.

      Damn. Will and I pumped the bass and played some System of a Down...I believe there should be a recount on the "singing of the lady", simply because she was outshined by  Bounce .

It's just a really good game day, I s'pose.  I have a endoscopy test on Thursday, they're giving me lots of nearly illegal drugs to make sure I don't feel them ramming a big metal tube down into my guts. And if they say "Too much Coke" I'm going to blow myself away.  With a gun!  Well, not really. 1. For Abby, 2. I've been doing alright without it thus far.

      Kingdom Kong, right down the road from Kingdom Come, take a left at the trailer park and take the dirt road til you reach a rusty tin shed...there you are!  I think we cleared thisall out last night...well, for the most part. So let's just drop it. I enjoy being angry but I'm not too keen on the aftereffects.  Alex and them were planning on rolling us last night. I didn't know this, however, Alex told me today. Then they got lost. I laughed. That bunch of dumbasses...I really fucking hate them sometimes, I don't know why I hang around them anymore.  I know it sounds kind of snide and uppity but I really get tired of "let's work out!", "fast food, good!", and "we're trying so damned hard to fit in we're sticking out like a sore thumb!". FUCK! Alex really really enjoys gloating about what a great time he had working out, egging people (as he did last night, and he went on for about fifteen minutes), eating something of a sub-standard make, or having no life. And I get really sick of it, and being human, start to emulate it. He's been around a lot lately so I've been taking on pieces of him.  Sometimes I can't stand myself. And other times I eat cupcakes.

      Josh is right, Rosie.  Abby does not hate you.  I blame the majority of this on Scott, who slightly misconstrues all situations because HE HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CLUE WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT.  He never sees Abby, yet is constantly downing her, and taking you to his level of thinking.  Abby is epitomy of nice and just and fair and anything else that you could ever compliment her with.  Scott is jealous because Josh got Abby and he didn't.  I'm with Josh in that you're really reading a LOT into the situation.  If you'll notice, Abby never got mad.  She barely even showed annoyance.  I'm viewing this as your taking advantage of a minor infraction so that you can blow up at her, which you do not have the right to do.  Josh is most definitely justified in siding with her.  He loves her, she loves him.  Their relationship is not something you see every day.  That in itself justifies him siding with her, and I fully support that.  Abby has nothing on which to base a hate of you, and frankly I think that you're being a bit paranoid and slightly arrogant to think that she hates you.  She's met you for maybe five minutes?  Talked directly to you on the blog maybe thrice?  I know Abby than almost anyone else on this planet, and let me assure you that I know exactly who she does and does not hate.  Does she hate you?  No.  Does she like you?  No.  She has no information.  She has no need to like or dislike you.  The only thing she knows about you is that you have insulted me, and that will be held against you until she dies, most likely.  Other than that, she is, for the most part, completely apathetic about your entire existence.  You really don't have a great impact on her life, like it or not.  And continuing on what Josh said, you stick a knife in his back, you stick a knife in Abby's, and by doing so stick a knife in mine.  And it's me that's going to be pissed in the end, because Abby freakin' saved my life in 9th grade.  I owe her everything in my possession and more, and I will pay that debt if it's the last thing I do, by protecting her happiness and well-being, and that of everyone she loves.  And if you [that being a general you, not directed at you specifically] get in the way of that happiness, then by God if I don't absolutely rip you to shreds.  Josh, I apologize for saying to tone it down.  Perhaps you should stay at your own level.  I forgot for a second that this was Abby we're talking about.  You were provoked and you are justified in your comment.    This should be my last post on this topic.  I hope.  Cause I hate being angry.

      ok, stop take a deep breath, and re-read what you said to every-one else.  that means read your own posts and see if you still think it's reasonable.  Also think about exactly what was said by who and see if it seems derogatory.  stop the arguing and think.  Rosie, don't think that josh and linds are teaming up on you because they dislike you.  they are defending someone you attacked, wether or not she attacked you first is immaterial, you attacked her.  think about the think you basically attacked Linds over Michael,  i defended Linds not because she needed my help or because "I like her more" (don't you  ever  qoute me on that), but because you attacked her personally.  by the way if any of you post any more angry posts over that next few days i'm going to bitch slap you to Kingdom Kong and back.

      Wow.  If it looked like "ass" behavior to me, that's exactly what's going to come of it. I'm fucking not kidding, Rosie, "Why does your girlfriend hate me?" I'm sick of telling you she doesn't hate you!! What in the fuck is it going to take to convince you otherwise? And if you're going to act like a little kid and say, "too bad it offended ya" and shit like that, don't expect me to be all nice and civil...if not anyone else, I can just feel the poison behind what you said.  No one  was  attacking you, but again, and by God as my witness, you will stop this "you hate me so i hate you" shit or I won't have anything to do with you. I mean, honestly, has she actually come out and said, "I hate you you dumb bitch,"??? I want you to give me tangible, real, solid proof that this actually happened, or I want you to drop it. I can't believe you would sink so low as to judge someone on what you  think  they said. And also...you stick a knife in my girlfriend's back and you stick a knife in mine.  It sickens me to see the rampant level of unfounded hate and immaturity flowing through this situation. Immaturity is the best word for it. You said to me the other day, "C'mon, you can't seriously side with her?" or something to that effect? I just about blew my top when I heard that, Rosie. Denying all other factors, i.e.: being my girlfriend, and trusting her beyond most everyone...that's just crossing the line.   There is NO PROOF that anyone pointed the finger at you!! Absolutely none, whatsoever! I don't care what you assume, I don't care what you've heard from Scott, I don't care what the fucking President of Finland told you, unless I can hold and feel and taste the fact that Abby actually fully loathes you, then I could see that you were founded in your opinion...I wouldn't agree with it, but I wouldn't be calling you an ass for it.  It's time to stop being so damned bigoted and so highly placed above everyone else and grow up. It hurts me more than you know when you say the things you do about Abby. It hurts to watch you lash at her because of what you THINK. IT DOESN'T ALL WORK ON INTUITION; SOMETHINGS ARE  REAL  AND  FOUNDED  AND HAVE  REAL  CAUSES.   This is all about what you don't know. So stop it before we dig this any deeper.   And all of you know: I've only attacked back because I was struck first.

      First of all, NEVER INSULT ABBY. Ever.  Secondly, if we're going to stay friends, we should probably quit damning each other, especially when that person is my best friend's boyfriend.  You can get me upset really easily by insulting someone/something that is important to Abby.  Third, Rosie, you're right, you haven't antagonized me lately and I 'm grateful.  Abby also knows about that if that's what this whole thing is about.  But Josh was there last year when I was with Michael, and was really good about supporting me then, through the whole breakup, and is he isn't insulting me now (Thanks, Josh, that's really meant a lot.)  Will too, though he doesn't know all the drawn out details, cause I don't get to talk to him much, and when I do it's about math most of the time.  Fourth, Rosie, you don't know Abby either, and I can recall you saying some stuff about her before, whether good or bad.  Yall just need to stop all contact, it seems.  Fifth, no, Abby's not a big fan of yours Rosie, and I've told you for a while to watch your step.  But the way to fix it is not to insult her and not apologize for previously insulting her.  Please don't try to fix anything when it comes to Abby.  Leave that to me (and josh) and let it go.  When Abby gets mad, I advise you to run, especially if she's mad on the behalf of me (or josh), which she is.  She will not forgive you as easily for what you said to me about Michael than if you had said something to Josh about her, because you're insulting me not her.  Some holds true for me.    And as for you and Josh, just stop cussing each other out NOW and talk it out, cause it's only going to go down hill from here, if history is about to repeat itself.  Josh probably shouldn't have called you an ass, true, but you're going a bit too far.

      Exactly Josh...Damn you.  Thanks for calling me an ass and all when all I was doing was reminding your girlfriend that sometimes school talk on the blog is actually needed. I wasn't even complaining about school...I was reporting since Linds has been sick. I could have told her to shove it...I didn't. I really do like Abby but people that attack me and think that I'm wrong EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T KNOW ME just irk me a tiny bit. Yes I know I antagonized Linds...hell you would have too last year. I've stopped but she's the one bringing him to the surface lately...even before the zabeth's b-day. Linds doesn't expect me to be for michael so if I suddenly stopped...A check and make sure I'm alive and B if I'm rational. I've stopped antagonizing her and yes I know I was wrong. I even think I told her sorry...if I didn't Lind I'm sorry. I'm NOT saying I like him but if you like him...ok but God help him if he pisses you off in anyway. Josh...I don't talk to you alot lately but I thought we were friends so calling me an ass and basically telling me that I can't even defend myself is alittle bit off. Sorry but for some reason your gf doesn't like me and i thought I could kinda fix that. Apparently not.

      Augh. You didn't say what language.  I'm guessing it's Latin, and if that's the case, and thanks to a wonderful online Latin cheat sheet, it should be "to rub" or "to wear away". But that's probly wrong. In any case, that's my guess.

      I  did  understand it! That's true, that was the "ghey" week, altho that word has faded into obscurity...for now. And of course, the word this week is "kiitos". And "kylla" with two dots over the "a". That did make sense, actually, there's always only been one noted record a week.   FINNISH IS GREAT AND WE'RE ALL LEARNING IT. Man, is it cool.  Your Finnish word for the day is:   suomi  ....which means " Finland " in Finnish!!!! Kylla!!  WTF? What other reasons? C'mon Will, we're all open here.  It's true, Abby probably will have to call and remind me, and I'll make a feeble excuse about a butterfly, then mutter something else incomprehensible and non-sensical, and then, fly like a bat out of hell to the...church. Yeah. Redundancy is awesome.

      But before that you said "ghey" 2 posts in a row, so that's probably considered a record too.  So you have 2 records in a row, which is a record in itself.  Not bad for one week.  Congratulations if you just understood any of what I just said.

      9 posts, if you count the "oh, the pain" post.  Congratulations.  Have you noticed it's just you and me on here lately, though?  If rosie had been on, we would've been off-topic ages ago.  And you won't be late to your wedding because Abby will call and remind you to come.

      *bows in admonition*  Well, I dunno.  I saw Scary Movie 3 last night. All of you have to see it, immediately. It's the funniest movie I've seen in about 3000 years. And I wasn't even a wink in the gene pool's eye, by golly.  I didn't talk about it last night because I wanted to see how long we could adhere to one topic. I notice I jump around a lot, and I wanted to see how long I could keep one going. Obviously, not long. Thusly is my ADD.  Seriously, I'm one of those guys that's going to be late for his own wedding because he was too enthralled by a pretty butterfly hovering delicately outside a nearby window.   Doublesigh.

      Can we just STOP. Yes I think Scott exaggerated. No I don't think he's out right lying. Jaoh...since when did you become the perfect protector(it's a good thing). Linds....HI how are you...GO TO SLEEP YOU HAVE MONO.

      Sigh. It never ends.  I figure we're supposed to learn something from all this, but we won't if we drag the corpsed nuances of it all through the dirt.  And I think a lot of this has to do with Scott, so why don't we attack him instead? We'd probably feel a lot better, and we wouldn't be sitting here beating each other up and taking this situation more places that it shouldn't be. But that's just me.  And he deserves it. Y'hear that Scott (if you're reading this)? You deserve it. Seriously dude. You wanna talk about hypocracy and "sawdust in your neighbor's eye versus plank in own", you should really think more about who's eye the plank is in. And whereas Linds and Abby do have the rage but can keep it to a level passive enough so as to not make any damage, I cannot make such promises. I get unchecked pissed-ness. It annoys me when you attack me behind my back. It INFURIATES me when you attack my girl. Like the kind that actually hurts me until I catharthasize it. And contrary to popular belief, it feels GREAT when I do it.  So if ever again I hear this misinformation being leaked, or that you've been saying some un-nice things about my relationship with Abby, or her,  especially  her, consider yourself a house in the wake of a California forest fire. Kablam goes the last minutes of your feeble and feckless life.   On that note, an excellent night I wish to you all. I started my Poe essay early and the verbosity is simply tenacious upon my nigh-possessed functions. Har Har.

      rosie, just read everything twice before you respond, and we really are no longer interested in critizing you.  linds, you might want to make your point a little clearer when you are speaking, and read your post twice before you publish it as well, you seem to be jumping to some conclusions as well.

      Abby didn't comment on Scott.  She's never said anything about Scott.  That was my entire point.  Note the quote "Abby never said anything about Scott" in my last post.  Read the entire posts before you respond, Rosie.

      For the record, Abby never said anything about Scott.  That was me.  Though she may or may not deel the same way.  But I was not speaking for her when I said that.

      It's about as hard as Chinese.  Josh, sorry for completely attacking Abby. Yes I re-read the posts and yes I went alittle...fine really haywire. (Will never ever say that I actually listen to you for once.) BUT...and yes there is a but, I still don't think that Abby likes me. I would love for your girlfriend to like all of the group but apparently it isn't going to happen. I hate the feeling of a subgroup in a group. Oh yes...and tell her the comment on sounding like Scott was really offensive...REALLY.   Linds, I understand your devotion to Abby and I'm happy that she responds in the same. Sorry about Michael.  Will, don't you ever quote me on this: thanks for the good advice...I think you were the only one speaking without blatant anger, thank you. Your post calmed me down to NOT make an angry post. No I'm not going to listen to you more =P.  Zabeth...don't know where you are.  All: Sorry guys for going off the deep end. You've all known how I hate it when people hate me. Yes I know Abby doesn't hate me ... I knew that when I posted last but I also know that she doesn't particularily like me and I would like for that to change but it doesn't really matter since I never see her. Anyway have fun all. And Linds, you know how you  said you blamed it on Scott....don't...blame it on my insanity oh yes...and I do realize that he's jealous therefore josh, I don't like him. I can't stand people that say one thing and act out another. Sorry guys...Josh I dub you with the right to bring me down to earth if I ever completely go crazy again.  Oh yes, Abby seemed nice Friday. Needless to say, I didn't see the posts until today. Also guys what happened at DI.

      I just realized I said "we" throughout that entire thing without consulting the rest of the group to see if that's how they felt too, though I'm sure it is.  But just in case, substitute an "I" every place you see a "we."  Just don't to be putting words in people's mouths.

      All right.  That's a hard post to follow.  We really knew most of the stuff you just told us though, or at least I did.  We know more than just what you tell us.  Maybe I just picked up on it because I've been in a silimiar situation.  Obviously not the same causes or anything, but I've definitely felt something close to what you just described.  Anyway, all I really have to say is that nothing you can do would make us feel any different towards you Josh.  You're one of my best friends in the entire world, Abby or no.  Nothing can change the history.  The other thing is that you really needn't ask forgiveness from us, but if you need to hear it, we forgive you.  Clean slate, Tabula rosa.  Start again if you want to, but there's really no need.  We love you for who you are, Josh, whoever that is.  And if it's the person you were before, we support that.  If it's a different person, we support that too.  You need to do what makes you happy.  No one else matters.  Not me, not Abby, not Rosie, nor Will or Liz.  Take yourself into account first and worry about the rest of us later.  We'll support you no matter what you do.  We've all been through a lot of stuff together, and this is just another thing to overcome.  We're the closest-knit group of friends I've ever had, and nothing can ever break that.  Nothing.  We're here for you, Josh.  No matter what hour of the day, what day of the week.  We're always here for you.  Call me if you need me for anything. 473-2890.  You're one of the greatest people on earth, and don't let anyone tell you any different.  Don't let yourself tell you any different.

      I need to make this post.  I need to tell you all something very important, and you can do with it what you will.  There's someone very familiar that you all need to meet. I'll come back to that.  This thing with Calhoun did not start this, it only confirmed it.   Today, I had a really bad day. It wasn't the saddening kind that makes me think suicide. Quite the contrary. This was a day that is going to change my life, it was so bad. I was not depressed. I realized that I was fucking horribly mad. More than mad, I was homocidal. I joke about it a lot, but mark me, MARK ME, I was thinking about taking a baseball bat over to that stupid whore's house and finishing the job her ex didn't. And mark me on that one, too. This is all going to come to a point, I promise, but there's going to be a ton of malice beforehand. I said do with it what you will, and I hope that you'll do just that.  Actually, I didn't get homocidal until about a hour ago. Beforehand I was complacent, I was stoic. I sat back and got pissed but I didn't blow up. I always do that. Like I told Abby earlier tonight, I was just "on a low simmer". But for some reason this one just wouldn't stay there. I blew up a couple of minutes ago. I started banging things, and Katie was laughing and so was I. I didn't think I was serious when I was saying, GOD I'M SO FUCKING MAD. But then I felt great. Why?  I felt great because I accept the reality of my situation. I've been repressing it. I don't know why. I came down to earth and said what the mother fuck I really felt about it, and I embraced the godawful truth of it. It's that I am so fucking sick of being complacent and respectful to these dickheads that are going to fuck around with me, like that stupid whore, and like Julian, and this other kid I just heard about, pulling some shit.  I figured something else out. I figured out how much complacency I have with the cycle of abuses. You know how people do? First, things are going ok, you think it's all alright and whatnot, and you trust the person. Then they start to slip and pull some shit. And then...then they just come out and abuse openly, and they don't care what the fuck you have to say about it. And THEN, and here's the good part, they try to make up for it, and mostly, THOSE FUCKING CUNTS GET THE FUCK AWAY WITH IT!!!! ALWAYS!!!! And why is that? Because we all remember how good it used to be, and we figure they'll change, so we give them another chance, and another and another, and we convince ourselves that they actually are good people and that their bad, abusive sides really aren't what they are.   I'VE GIVEN IN TO THEM!!! WE ALL HAVE!!! I ALWAYS give in to Calhoun! I ALWAYS give in to shit, because I'm in love with the ideal, rather than reality!! I fucking hate reality! I don't live here! And therein lies the problem.  I've given up trying to exist in this world. I let the complacent side get the better of me. And I know I have, and so I have some apologies to give out later. But I gave up, and I let this dumbass motherfucker take over, this thing that I'm not. This thing that doesn't think for himself, he thinks for everyone else. He doles out advice but he can't ever adhere to any. I just gave up a long time ago, but suddenly, I'm back. Thanks, Calhoun.  And so, I need you all to meet this person I gave up on because he was too perverted, too coarse, too vulgar. He was the thing I talked about in that song,  I'm Just A Bastard .  He's me.  I've tried so long to keep him back, and I don't know why. Maybe I thought that everyone couldn't accept him, but now I know...everyone just has to, or they just have to leave me be.   So now: I need to tell the ones that have to hear this how incredibly sorry I am that I've been the one pulling the shit and blinding you towards the real me. I'll detail all the circumstances and then you'll know...perhaps you have known. Whatever the case, I need to tell you, the real me does, the one that has occasional and guiltless bad thoughts, and thinks that some shit really is gay, and really wants to take some people out.  And I want you all to know right here and now: I am not blaming ANY of you for ANY of this. I don't want to hear an "I'm sorry" over any of this, this is TOTALLY not any of your faults. This is something I have done to myself, entirely. It could be said that your actions influenced it...don't think that either. It's how I stupidly interpreted them. If there's one thing I can't stress enough, it's to keep being yourselves. I'm preaching it, yes, and right now I'm going to adhere to it.   Please, don't take any of this the wrong way. I've felt it growing like a tangible presence since...god knows when. But it's been there since I can remember, and I finally figured out what it was, and am in the process of dealing with it.  Linds was right when she said, "the longer you wait the harder it will be", but I mean more than just with Calhoun. I've been waiting so damned long and not admitting to myself that I have a pretty fucking bad problem that it's turned into a nearly-impossible-to-resolve crisis. But I'm going to handle this. I hope I don't scare any of you away.  I just can't keep him in anymore. All I ask is that you allow me to let him come out.  So tomorrow..."fuck her feelings". In case I get suspended or do something really stupid and not like me, you all will know why because...I'm telling you. If she's going to get righteous with me, then fuck-a-hootenanny, I'm going to get righteous and then fucking some. I won't get fucking pissed on again, ever. Mark that shit, too.  No more abuses. "I wonder when all the abuses became commonplace." It just boggles me how hard I was trying NOT to think about them.  I'm sorry for this post, and I'm sorry for what might follow. But I just can't do the way I'm doing, for fear of losing my fucking mind.   Please bear with me as I try to heal all this damage I've caused. I'm so sorry to all of you I've hurt by this, whether you've noticed or not, I don't know what I can do to make it better. Hell, I don't know how to forgive myself yet.  Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

      So, We know teacher's can be completely wrong now. Linds, I found my scantron and she's way off like 13 points off...that could hurt. Josh go talk to her NOW...ok well not now and prolly not with some of Linds' language but you do need to talk to her. To make her understand that you are really versatile in your writing...not even mentioning your personality. Also show her that she's only read two of your essay's at most so she can't possibly know your completely style. Also the Aristotle essay can't hope personality...it was very dry. SO...don't her write that on all you papers.

      Not a problem at all, Josh.  I just figured I knew what I was talking about more than he did.    But Josh, you've got to tell your mom or someone about what Calhoun did.  She hasn't got the right.  She has to have tangible proof before she can accuse you of plagerism.  You know you wrote that paper, and so do I, and I'll be damned if you get a C for a paper as good as that one.  Fuck her feelings, Josh, this is not only about your grade, but also about your integrity and dignity, and if nothing else, those are the things you have got to stand up for.  Be assertive, Josh, tell her what you feel.  Tell her you're insulted, that you're pissed, that you demand a better grade.  If she doesn't give you one, take it to the administration.  I'll go with you.  Abby will go with you.  We'll both go with you.  But you absolutely  have  to talk to her about it.  Abby backs me up on this one Josh.  Everyone knows your right but her, and she's the only one who doesn't believe it.  Stand up for yourself, Josh.  She'll just keep running over you if you don't.  I don't give a shit what she thinks; you're an awesome writer, and I won't have her discouraging that anymore.  Josh, this is a very important issue.  This kind of stuff goes on your record that goes to your next english teacher.  I'm serious, Josh.  You've got to take control of this situation.  Now get your ass into that classroom tomorrow, and tell her exactly what you want from, and be forceful.  Not disrespectful, but assertive enough to get what you want.  Josh, you're one of the most gifted writers I've ever seen, and I won't let her think otherwise, and neither should you.  Please Josh, if not for yourself, then for mine and Abby's sake, please talk to Ms. Calhoun tomorrow.  The longer you wait the harder it will be.  Call me on my cell if you need me.  I should be up to all hours of the night.  See you tomorrow.

      Sigh. It's raining, how stoic.  I don't really care this time, about Calhoun. Hell, I knew that was coming judging by the other marks and comments she's made on my papers. But, say we get that Poe essay back and I get a big goose-egg...  See, that's a problem. If I do get a zippo I'm probably going to go off on her, and they's just ain't no gray area in that respect. Actually, I'll probably puss out and sit there and whine about it and get red faced and have Julian sitting there going, "Well it doesn't sound like you, blah blah blah, let me talk out of my ass cuz I think I know what you write like." That little fucking fuck. That pissed me off more than anything. Thanks for the coverage, Linds. I was so pissed off I forgot to come up with that reasonable and obvious defense that would have made me feel a little better despite Julian's chiding.   Damn it. Two deep breaths, c'mon you assclown hypnosis tape, do your magic.

"Fuck it" psycho-focus My life is over, concerned? You're duly noted again  I drink too much caffeine And I don't pay any mind I'm move way too slow I'm always second in line In times feeling down I'd be the last one you'd call I'm fucked up and boring Scabby knees so I crawl I'm hating myself  For every second I breathe I'm trying to tell you Can't you fucking believe? You never would know it Til the time came to be I'm going to blow it Then you'll see the real me   Chorus   Wait!!!111   Chorus  to fade  Badass. I like that song a lot.   Chained  by Stranglebox  Tell me, you said And where do I begin Guilty? Hell yeah But who's to call it a sin Filthy past tense defines What I call self So kill me, cuz I can't Ever make this well It's not that swell  I'm sorry, I can't explain I'm sorry, I didn't say that I'm sorry, but I'm all chained and I am a fake and this is a waste  No more, no more I can't take it No more, no more I can't  Window portents The outside looking in It makes no sense But circles start to fin Timely forceps have Pulled this skin aside Bangs on, doorsteps And now I cannot hide It's do or die   Chorus   No more, no more...  Solo   Nomorenomore...   Chorus   These songs are really repetetive, non?   Painpainted  by Stranglebox  I have said a thousand times That everything is going fine Everyone's so fucking nice And all good, no between the lines So I have lied to make you reach And pull the darker part of me I don't know much, but this I know It's time that I was letting go  They force my head below the ground I scream in pain, they let me drown  My gray world is so Far gone, I don't know Pain paints all I've found (Just like the rest, the next brings me) Down  I have tried a thousand times To tell you that it's quite alright And all the while the parasites are Eating from my fucking mind So I will sit and bang my head And hit til me or them are dead I hate the way you've hurt me so And why you do I'll never know  They saw me open and let me bleed I scream, the pain sweeps over me   Chorus   My colour scheme is pain (All the world is black and gray)  If I could take it all back To the second that you Snapped me in half I wouldn't waste another second Facing any of that I know it's not right And I know it's not fair Blinded, walking through the shadows Razors, fire, and blank despair I wonder when all the abuses  Became commonplace The painpainted memories are never Leaving a trace of you resentment Or of your hostility Congratulations on the kill, And now we leave him to bleed  They're closing in, I can't escape They're closing hands around my face I whisper soft so not to breathe Such pain, to death they strangle me (x 2)   Chorus  x 2  It all brings me down  And that one is considered our heaviest nombre...I love it.  And more latr, bcuz my faingers be ti-red and I'm not sure which ones to put, really. Look, I didn't split an infinitive. Take that, Calhoun.

      Heheh, perhaps. JD (my teacher) took away the snake I was using to record with...not a real snake...and so I'm sort of in the dark. And what, with no drummer. I sort of gave up on the musician thing for a while, but Nick Bruey is out of band now and is going to help me record...'haps he will join?, or Alex will be motivated?  And you "typoed" a typo. Fascinating!  SURELY I SHALL! Now...I don't know which CDs you have. Abby has a copy of "the demo" that we sort of changed since then, so if you have that one, then I could post those. I could anyway if you get a copy, since I delete a lot of them that I just don't think I'm meant to do yet. But...  THE CLASSICS:  I'm thinking  Broken Me , and  Little Rhyme  and  My Solution ...what else was there?  Close My Eyes ?!? Those four right quick.   Broken Me  by Stranglebox  All wrong, I know this ain't the right way Playing ping-pong, I am the toy of my fate I shoulda known that it all would come back around I wasn't thinking, and all the sudden I'm down I'm like a fly trapped on a field full of glue My brain is ransacked, all telling me what to do I'll never hear you, never ever again I'll make these words true As soon as I put down this pen  Hey hey, see me in between See this twisted dream, it's just a seam Of what I might have been Hey hey, you're a broken lie To you it don't seem right To waste another day, it seems So loose the broken me who bleeds  So long, I couldn't take anymore I guess I got strong, and I walked right out the door You'll never hear me, but you know I'll never care I had a vision, selfish, you blew it like air I'm just so tired, don't wanna do this again It's uninspired, but I loved losing my head I'm going out there, I'm falling into the trap Nothing left to share And it came to the point that I snapped   Chorus   Something has hit me and I'll never be the same (2x) Bleed me out   Chorus  x 2  WHEE!!! I had fun recording that one.   Little Rhyme  by Stranglebox  Father father, where'd you go? Calling out to no one Empty, sullen, all alone Mercy to my mission Brother brother, moaning low Living ruination Crying crying, time is slow Sleep in devastation  So I pray you'll be alright Cuz all my other prayers have died And I hope you'll turn out right Since you've been otherwise denied Now I say my little rhyme Little comfort passing time Cuz you had every right to lie And for that I'll say goodbye  Mother mother, no one knows Just how deep this chasm Sunder pluder, I did so I've produced this spasm Sister sister, I'd forego Anything to save me Killed it killed it, bloody clothes Falsity depraves me   Chorus   and the Interlude   Chorus   Whee!! Alex played the drums on that one! That was the only one, out of all of these. And the next one...nobody's really heard the real version...except for Rosie cuz she was there when we did the talent show tryout. I lost the CDs. The only place it is anymore is on my computer upstairs safely tucked away in the harddrive. So you'd have to go there if you wanted to listen to it. And it SUCKS! So yes.   My Solution  by Stranglebox  Asylum was the answer They opened doors and let me in And told me time was not unmaking They told me I could finally win I seek now, retribution Raised my eyes and soon I saw The steel and lonesome of my prison Bang my head against the stone cold floor  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just Walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and  Fade me away  Silence, now my reason, I sat alone inside myself I gave the all that I had in me They stole my life and gave me hell Addiction was the cancer And God, the price I paid And slowly dying, I surrendered My poisoined soul as it fades to gray   Chorus    Chorus  x 2 Now that I've laid my life to waste My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away My solution, I'm gonna find out the only way to escape And my solution, that I break free from this cage  I haven't heard that song in a long time. And now, my personal favourite...well except for these two new ones but none of you have heard them yet, and they pretty much are not done. So...   Close My Eyes  by Stranglebox (surprised?)  Hey you there, are you listening? I won't be ignored again Outside here it's a lonely place, and I'm Trying to figure out how this began  I'm apart and struck at the heart The whole world hears my cries And you thieved to the point of deceit But if you care, please close my eyes Another down, my pain is renowned The thorn is in my side Hollow feats make a man of the meek And if you care, please close my eyes  Hey, I'm here and I'm thinking about Why I never went away I'm still trying hard to live without You're sweet touch within my brain   Chorus   Sololudethingy   Chorus , repeat the last line a few times, voila.  And more to come if wanted!

      Excellent you ask, Rosie Jiang. Here is the song, a nice little "let's make fun of myself" ballad, called   Cynical Sarcastic  by Stranglebox (it's been a while, hasn't it?!?)  I got pissed off so I wrote this song There's no new words so sing along Can you say "fuck"? Can you scream real loud? Cuz if you can do that, then you know just how Grandma's in the kitchen makin' s'ghetti and meatballs A little Taiwanese kid just learned how to fly And everybody's story is a story to beat all So here comes the chorus, and you can't beat mine  Half-past the cynical, borderline sarcastic Welcome to the chorus where it all comes back Maybe feign political, really self-slapstick This doesn't make sense, but you already knew that  So here goes the part where I first say "fuck" But if you've already heard us, then fuck stuff I don't have another Top 40 coming up any time And it's by the grace of God that I can even still rhyme Every motherfucker hearing "fuck", and going crazy I bet you'd fucking like it if I yelled some fucking more This might be the fucking greatest you've heard maybe But all I fuckin' know's, it's making my throat sore   Chorus   The End! And another. Ok, so the song is called  Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue) , but it isn't about sniffing glue...even tho it actually comes out and says that. It's more about wanting to be killed and stay a kid than to grow up and be everyone's bitch, and glue is the proposed remedy.   When last I checked, "fuck" was used very interestingly in this song, and without frugality. It's another pop-punk song, hence the excessive use of "fuck" and other four-letters. So lessgo!! w00tw00t!!!111oneone   Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue)  by Stranglebox  You tell me I am gonna be A really big star if I can be A superman, everything and more Than I am All society has pressured me To go and take a stand Where I cannot I make a lot of mistakes And more than half the time I'm on a repeat anyways I'm not gonna learn a stupid motherfucking thing So would you please shut the fuck up And go the fuck away  You have told me a thousand times But I never really seem to change I haven't got a reason or rhyme Cuz all I fucking feel is shame So let's cut the bullshit and get to the heart And that way we can find a real place to start Yeah, I don't really know about a thing you do Cuz all's I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (Hooah!!)  You talk about how great I am When I'm watching it So would you understand when I Say that I can't take anymore The teams ain't fucking fair And I'm the one with the losing score Gonna kill me a bunch 'o braincells Cuz all the bullshit that was simple's On a downslide to hell It's ok if I am only talking about  Fucking up, but when I do it Then it's time to throw me out   Chorus  Lude  Chorus  Yeah, I don't really know But hell if anybody knew Cuz all I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (YEEAAAAH!!!)  That stuff after the chorus in parenthesis is really in the song, it's a great one!!! This is the ultimate "Fuck conformity!!!" Anthem right here.   Hmm...looking thru Ye Olde Booke Ofe Notese, I want to post a more serious one. I've written a thousand since I started in on the demos. With such titles as  Norm Bakerton the Monkey Shit Shoveller ,  Cacophony ,  Churn ,  Grave  (which is actually going on the demo once we get it all down pat.....IF we do), and... Slump . I might as well.  It might take some thinking to figure out the last line of the chorus...sort of open to interpretation, but I'm sure you all could get something out of it.   Slump  by Stranglebox  I woke up early Saturday morning smelled like rain and Feeling blown and surly I thought tomorrow would hurt like hell I hope that I'm not right.....as I open my eyes  I took my time I drank a Coke and swallowed memories I lost the rhyme The reason soon thereafter followed I sink into a wall.....you're up, but nature says you fall  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use some new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  I waited outside Cold as hell the street was frozen I smiled as it shined And knew how quick it'd kill me If I gave it one quick try.....cuz it only lives to die  The drive was cold, it was 6 PM, December 21 And ten more days, I know Will be a new year, this has been The worst one of my life.....it sucks, but it burns to go outside  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  (little 'lude)  Oh it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the tiem, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all (repeat)  I've become a really odd songwriter lately. I don't write in any given time period (granted,  Slump ), I just write a whole lot of really really bipolar stuff. Sigh...sometimes it sucks to be on the craaazy side of the lefty fence.  And by the way...Jsoh? Can that even be pronounced?

      Dudes.  I wrote the two coolest songs today...they're called  Slump  and  Cynical Sarcastic . The first one is a serious one, and the other one is a fake punk song making fun of all the other songs I've ever written, and myself for that matter. I need to go get the lyrics to that one and post them.  Slump  is just cool because of how Nirvana it sounds, not that it's anything special.  But I just thought I would say that because saying stuff is cool.

      Someday someone will. There'll be some piano player and he'll be playing so innanely fast that his hands will explode, and they'll want somebody to take over. And then you'll be like, "Aww fruckin' crunk!!!111oneone" and merrily dance your fingers across the besanguined keys. I don't know if "besanguined" is a word, but now it means "bloodied".  Well cre. I'll be seeing the greater part of you bright and early  demain. I am weary with death and fatigue. It'd be really funny if I missed the bussi. Lord, but it would.  So. Males are evil. Of course we are. In general, guys are just more hellbent on self-indulgence and fulfillment. But from a more general perspective, and to defend my species, if it weren't for our being evil there wouldn't be a species. Lord knows it's the evil of man's heart that makes us kill, and try to stay alive, and procreate. You know if it weren't for some horny bastard deciding to take a poke at Cavelady Grunwelda we wouldn't have gone much past our roots, evolutionarily speaking. And I know the female part of the equation wasn't thinking on those lines.  Yes, the male species is evil...unfortunately, we're a necessary type. What a debacle it must be for the she-woman manhaters such as Rosie.  I didn't say that last part for any reason. I just wanted to use the word "debacle". Damn, is it crunk.  It's time to schleep!

      Eagh, yes, but I'm talking about a be-you-ti-ful song...it's got to be  Black . Lord knows I'd take an EMO collection, tho. I won't be able to tell the difference between all of them, tho, those silly, bleeding together EMO bands (disincluding me, of course).  Speaking of bands, read this, c/o Musician's Friend...the coolest thing I've ever heard:     "1973, apparently fried by a generous dose of angel dust, Keith Moon is unable to finish the opening show of the Who's "Quadrophenia" tour in front of 13,500 people at the Cow Palace in San Francisco ... all warmed up and ready to play, and wanting to make a good impression the first night of the tour, Townshend calls out to the audience, "Hey, can anybody out there play drums? I mean good. Any takers come up here on stage" ... 19-year-old Thomas Scot Halpin from Muscatine, Iowa, currently living in Santa Cruz, is in the audience at stageside with his hometown buddy, Mike Danese, who starts yelling to the security guard that his friend is a great drummer ... actually Halpin hasn't played in a year, but after promoter Bill Graham asks him if he can do it, he finds himself on the throne of his idol manning the sticks ... he holds his own for the final three songs, gets to party down with the band afterward, and eventually is named "Pickup Player of the Year" by Rolling Stone... "  How crunk is that?

      WRONG!!  Black  kicks  Last Kiss 's ass anyday! I haven't even heard it and I already know it. I like being a Rap kizid every once in a while, but hey...EMO is it. I don't listen to much, but I might as well be. Every song has such an EMO background to it.   Maybe just a grunge kid. Shit, I don't know what I am. Perhaps I'm nothing. That ain't so bad.  And as you all know, Sbox is sort of defunct. I'm not, but the collective is. Sigh. So...yes. We were working on Linds's drumming skills today. She learned the fundamentals of drummer's language.  DumDumBahtikDumtikDumDumPAHtitiTISSS.  I just saw Revolutions. Damn, what a fugg'd up movie. I need sleep.  Hm.

      Sure, Rosie.  Josh, I'm not sure that EMO kid descibes you.  But more than rap kid, so I'll tolerate it for now.  But I miss Stranglebox.  Much tearage.  Anyway, the best Pearl Jam song by far is Last Kiss.  So there.

      This has never happened before. I am the last poster on every BLog I am a subscriber to, at this very moment. What an odd sensation.  So. Pearl Jam is a great band. I've been listening to their CD  Ten , and I must say, it is eleven songs (contrasting to the album's name... ...) of pure genius. The song  Black  was a nice depressing ballad through the last couple of rainy days; there's a piano in it and it somehow reminds me of rain. And, my dad was playing this album non-stop during the carefree days of five years old...ELEVEN FUCKING YEARS AGO...and it reminds me of that, as well.  Rosie brought up today that this whole "I'm not being me" thing has happened before. I agree. I think that it's just a stupid and bad thing I always do when I'm met with new situations: I try to adapt to everything more than I need to, and I end up bludgeoning everything in the wake of aftermath, and knocking holes in everyone, not disincluding myself.   Lord, this remind me of last year, sitting here making stupid EMO posts for hours. Honeybunches of oats. That's my new curse.  And speaking of EMO...I started an EMO band care of Billy Bassett. We were talking about how I look like Cousin It with my hair all in my face, and then we were talking about how cool EMO is, and then I was like..."Dude...that's the name of my EMO band...Cousin It." And Billy said it was a great name. So. I'm going to start writing EMO songs now! Woo! I'm an EMO kid and I hate my life. And you dumped me in the fifth grade...so I'm gonna make me die.  That would be the name of my production company, too.  I'm Gonna Kill Me  Music, in case anyone wants me to produce them. Oh hell. I'm not really concerned with that right now. More, I'm practicing the piano parts to  Black  and listening to Jam. Hell yeah.  Yell heah.

      Eech. It doesn't work yet, they've told me.  Well. All I talked about was the..."wonders"...of the blood bomb, and how much I've learned about the absorbancy of feminine care products this year. I hate me a honeybunch.  I'm getting sick, I think. And it sucks. And to top it off, Abby was sick yesterday, and that is not cool. And then, Alex left early, and Linds didn't even show. It was a fucking great day, all cloudy and whatnot. It kept everyone pretty somber during Algebra, tho. I think they were listening to the rain and thinking, "Heymaybemetrogotoutthatwouldbecool." Spinks even came up to me and flat out said they'd look online and found out that Metro got out.  People...come on! Metro doesn't get out for shit, and never has! Especially for one day of off and on rain with little squalls here and there. Just because they don't have the greatest attendance record doesn't mean they aren't strict about telling peeps to come to school. Everyone knows Williamson County is the only one that lets out because the clouds "were dark" and "I think it's supposed to be cold tonite...that could be an indicator of snow in the near-future".  A lot of people=dumb to the fifth.

      Since we know how well that works. There has to be a rule that during fall retreat it has to rain the whole time to just before we leave. Grr. Oh yes, The senior and junior boys some how got a hold of water balloons during the trip. Last night they decided to bomb the Senior/Junior cabins around 12:30. SO around then they climb up to our area...seperate area safty thing...but they were seen by another cabin so to shut them up they bombed them. Then the middle school girl counselor told them that she would help them get us. She walked in (by this time everyone is awake) and asked us to go on a night adventure and to be careful. We locked all the doors and they pelted us with water balloons. Allie then tells Kara to open the door and see if the guys are still there. My bunk is right by the door so as they open the door i get this wonder full view of them screaming (high pitched) and running behind another bunk because allie got hit by a balloon in the mouth (Yes! Go boys!). Anyway the wonderful duo forgot to pull the door close so that the boys have freedom to pelt more balloons into the room. On busts on the ceiling and then dripped onto someone's bed. Another plopped itself on the floor and created a socking carpet. Another landed perfectly cradled on a sleeping bag of a counselor. The couselor grabs is a runs outside ready to pelt them...she's not fast enough. The girls are completely furious and want revenge so we hit them hard! Guys hate periods and pads and tampons... and we didn't have any water balloons so guess what the boys found? Ao we colored the pad and tampons with red lipstick and then soaked them in water...the rain helped.  Then we all snuck down to the boys cabin and found that Brian and some other guy were on the porch...we hauled A to get back to the cabin. After that we sent the 7 senior girls...juniors next year... to plaster then on the porch. We had planned to spell out U Lose but they didn't have time. Amber...really fast... told the others to run as she smacked a pad...very loudly... on the the glass door and threw a blood bomb (tampon...wet) into the cabin. Around 2 we snuck up again and found the guys cleaning up tampons and pads...i love counselors... Also it turned out the we pasted them on the frosh and sophmore side of the cabin so they had alittle girl education as the older guys watched. Phil already has something planned for next year... anyone have any ideas for the girl's come back? Oh yes... I'm running on minimal sleep because of them so I got to be grumpy all day...oh yes a suffocated phil on the buss too. I love retreats. THe speaker had dreadlocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's 28year old white male that has dreadlocks. He's awesome because he has ADD and made the whole Deut. 6:4 interesting. that's the verse on loving the Lord your God with all you Heart, Soul, and Might. Heart was about love and choosing while Soul was unconditional love. He's put off God for along time and he actually told us to lean into our doubts and explore. That way our faith is our own and we trully will find Chris for ourselves.  OH YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! We played football...or rather I watched. I forgot to bring another set of clothes and such. Anyway the Brentwood Bowl was won by the Girl Team named the Cootles...Anyone know what a Cootle is? The trophy was a rubber football with a rose on top while the guy's won a plastic moose...dear...buck thingy. They weren't sure. SO...retreat was awesome. 9th Hour was awesome too. they were the band

      Hahahaha. Another Aetolia gee...I mean, Aetolia head. Man, I used to play that game. I fucking OWNED!  I was in the Snakes, and let me tell you. I was the best of the n00bies. And I was a girl, a very flirtatious one (to the point of one of the guys "abusing" me, but I kicked his ass and laughed so it was ok), and I got away with a lot of shit. And then something or another happened, and I quit, which was sad because I was owning. But whatever.   I heard that, the typing better deal. I coulda locked up a good computer in my hayday...then I found out about the wonderous hotkey and macro functions c/o GMud (you'll find out what these are soon enough, or you could ask someone) and I was the Lord of All N00Ber Creation, but my typing kinda blew.   "st t  " "f" "f" "f" "rat". Hah. I just killed a rat. I can't believe I remembered that. What a loser I am.  But then someone else was playing it and they know how it feels once you get hooked. So I felt better.

Altho it does give you REM rebound cuz I had a dream that I got a truck for Christmas and my dad dislodged the house from the ground. And then I was trying to finish both English projects and the Psy paper in one night, and I was talking to someone about the consequences of not doing one of them, and how they would effect my grade. The house one was scarier, tho. It had a lot to do with open machinery...I  HATE  open machinery, almost as much as much, if not more than, I hate clowns.

      Wow. I like it when people put down two line sub-plots on the BLog and make no sense, and don't explain them, either. Everyone go do that, right now.  So yeah, I canned that monster and now I've got a 47.2. Philosophosaurus, he said.

      Males are slightly less evil now. Met this cute (in a weird way not like hot cute) asian at blair. First this lady came in and was trying to find him so of course after she's gone upstairs to find him he gets into a van. I walk out there (it's dark) and I was like, Hey I think your mom is inside looking for you. He's like erm Hi...my uncle just went to go look for her, she's my aunt and I don't speak english very well. I was like hey do you speak chinese and he's says korean so 10 points for Rosie looking stupid. Oh yes...phili is still boiling.

      1.  Shush your mouth, Rosie.  I won't be gossiped about.  And I'm with Josh on the non-sequitor.  2.  Josh, talk to Rob about Progressive dinner.  Tell him you want a friend to come or something so I'm not a third wheel, something, he'll believe anything.  I know he's not working then, so ask.  Also, did yall get anything at all done on that english project?  And how are yall's psych papers coming?

      What the fuck? Where'd you pull a "I'm letting go" in all of that? "But I want him to come to progressive dinner." "Maybe I'll go pay him a visit ;)"   I like instigation! That's a good start. But...a little more juice is in order, I think. UP, LINDS, UP!!!! Yes, I can tell. Level 6 is good. Look for Eisen, he might show up from time to time.  Ok, this is me doing the Dance of Disbelief. Rosie. There's a rule about non-sequiters and since all of your posts tend to be in them, I think we need to define a line as to how many pleas for real psychological help you can get.   I woke up early today. Last night was cool, Linds. Yeah, none of the list got used, but we had fun. Then again, the list isn't that great.   Blah. I'm still talking because I don't want to work on English yet. Hate.  Beautiful hate.

      Wow.  Today was a good day.  And here's my courageous moment of the day.  At the end of eighth period, Rob and I got up to talk like we usually do and I was talking about how I was going to the Choir Concert tonight, and he's like "Oh, I want to go with you!!"  Then this awful look comes across his face and he's like, "NO!! I have to work!!! Nooooo!!!!"  Kind of funny, but very nice at the same time.  *Sigh*  So, really it wasn't me, I just kind of instigated a bit.  But I want him to come to progressive dinner.  Oh well, he works all the time doesn't he?  Where does he work?  At some sportsplex thingy, I think.  Not sure.  Maybe I'll go pay him a visit ;)  Don't pray for snow till Friday night so I don't have to go to the Forensics tournament.  I need that day to work on my psych paper which, oh yeah, I haven't started yet.  Stupid Aetolia.  I love it.  Level 6 now, you know.  Almost 7.    Yeah, I really like that kid, can you tell?

      Ok better. Whew. You know sometimes you light the fuse without intending for the bomb to go off. That was the case there.  So...I'm going to Tempe in about three weeks. Everybody post lots so I can have something really cool to come back to.   Just now I went outside and did a snow dance, but I don't think I put enough heart into it. The forecast still hasn't changed. And the snow dance is 99.9% fallible too...oops, did I say fallible? Yeah, I meant it. Old Indian hoodoo isn't what it used to be.  Today was a really oddly good day. Today, I started following the trend in third period and began to sporadically "bust-a-move". So you might see me making some odd jerking moves pretty soon. Don't worry, it's no seizure! I was just inspired by Rob and the fact that everyday in third period, everyone but me is busting it out. So today I decided to break that trend and take the floor. Dancing is fun.  I hear there's dancing at the Progressive dinner?!?!? Dude. That would be killa. And I'll dance alone if Abby doesn't want to. But seriously, bust a groove sometime, you'll feel incredibly funny and well-liked, like the last pot of hot chocolate in the Starbucks in Antarctica.   Kapow!

      RRAUGHGGHGH.  I    HATE    IT.  FUCK .  sometimes i just hate stuff. today was one of those days. you know the kind. the kind when you just wanna   SCREAM  until it hurts. the kind that you get when you're really fucking tired and you seem to find  EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE WORLD IN A SINGLE SITTING. THAT  was today. i think it was just the repercussions of that other post i made a long ass time ago. i think it's the little pissed the fuck off side  TRYING TO MAKE A STAND BECAUSE HE IS PISSED THE FUCK OFF.  just now i read a really gay post some other blog made. it was about high school languages and why people take them. and of course they slammed  ALL OF THEM  but they slammed french and called all of the people in it gay. most of the time i would sit back and then reply with,  "hell fucking yeh i'm gay, and i wear my purple with pride, you stupid heteros."   but today was like  AAAAUGGGHHHH I HATE IT.  and so i sent an email that said:  FUCK THAT SHIT YOU FUCKING CROW TOKER I HOPE A BUS PRETENDS LIKE THEY DON'T SEE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF A STREET.  BAAAAH.  Actually, this post is quite sardonic in nature. It's was just meant to catharthasize,  because I love it . I dunno. I have male periods like no other. It's that being half-girl thing going on. I want to set stuff on fire...I say myself, but when it really came down to it, I would take the gas and pour it all over someone's house and watch it BBUURRRRNNN. And laugh my fucking tail off. I HATE IT.  RAUGH I HATE IT. Nothing works! God, I think it's my stomach. It hurts everywhere now. And I hate talking about it with anyone because of how fucking whiny it sounds. There are people with worse problems than me, or that have better stuff to do with their time. BUT I JUST HATE IT. It makes me PISSED. I yell at everything, and I think nothing is sacred, and I stay up late dead because it hurts the fuck out of me, and every time I feel it I get MORE pissed off, and it causes me to say, I HATE IT, and then it gets me to being pissed again. Hence, the cycle. We would simply have to remove the stimulus of pain, but that won't ever fucking go away, so, I LOSE!   BAH! I'm defective! There's nothing that can be found wrong, I was just put together wrongly or something. FUCKING I HATE IT. GODS! And so I feel like shit and so I start getting pissed the fuck off, and I HATE IT. I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS! I'M BEING REDUNDANT! FUCK!  Hahahaha. And again, it's all sardonic, kids. I really don't want to go to school tomorrow, so I think I'm going to get out of it somehow. God knows we don't do shit in any of those classes anymore. Or at least, I've been forced into a position of being blas because I have other things to THINK ABOUT. RRRAUGH I HATE I HATE I HATE IT.  Ok I'm done. If all of you would kindly just ignore this post, that would be cool. I couldn't go screaming with my dad today cuz mom's here busy whoring on the phone with Glenn. GOD!!!!! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. I just don't think I could convey how pissed off I got today when I told her she was going the wrong way on the road, trying really hard to get her to stop and then she speeds past three places she could have turned in and got to the place where we were going, then she pulls in the wrong fucking parking lot, thinks we're supposed to get out, I tell her it's the wrong place, she just stares at me blank-like, and THEN FUCKING THEN she YELLED AT ME BECAUSE SHE WAS FUCKING ON THE FUCKING PHONE WITH GLENN, AND FUCKING TELLS ME TO SHUT UP!  OH GOOD LORD, MY HEAD JUST MIGHT SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST. I can hear her right now, and it makes me PISSED OFF. Right, like you couldn't tell. God, I seriously need to get away from all of you before this all seeps through and causes lots of problems. God knows it already is. It makes me WEAK AND STUPID, and if not that, it MAKES ME SAY DUMB STUFF AND I HATE IT.  I'm going to bed. What the fuck am I doing?

      Yeh, whadafuk? About those 21 year olds. Hm.  Ok so...in lieu of recent mysticism, I'm making a rule that you can't have trailing, non-sequeter sentences anymore, unless you absolutely want to clue us in that you are having a problem and want to talk about it, just not on the BLog. Other than that, no more "So about that 21 year old guy.........."s and "Males are evil. I hate them."s and "There's something about how similar chicken and corn dogs are....."s. Except for that last one, all have happened lately! So, thus!  Because I am so cool I hereby do establish the   NON NON-SEQUITER RULE     Amen. And have lots of fun trying to find ways to violate it.  And as a first violation to this rule, please support Linds in this, her hour of greatest need...yeh not really, but that's just a fruckin' awesome segway into the aftermath of that statement.

      Of course I haven't told him about this site.  Mine either.  I think we're going to keep mine at least completely boyfriend free from now on.  Didn't work with Michael or Scott, so what makes me think it would work with Rob?  Anyway, I'm getting him some Steven Hawking books, cause he gets all his from the library.  and no wonder, they're freaking expensive!!!  And cookies, cause every guy I've talked to said I have to give him food.  That must be a guy thing.  And if you know what he's getting me, is this a good idea in that light?  Did that make any sense at all?  At this point, I don't care.  Studying for the English exam has eaten my brain.

      Hahaha. You got boxers. There's just something fundamentally wrong with girls wearing boxers, man. I dunno what, but there is. It's laugh-worthy. They hid a big old desk in my room, heh. Kind of an odd...way of doing it, but they did.  Hah! Penguins. They should have got you a real one, yo. That would be awesome.   Dude! I got my present from Abby tonite...wow. Wow. I love her. And man, I'm sorry for sort of not responding to any emails! Your email and mine have a problem communicating, it seems. I never get any you send. Hm...dude.

      Congrats on the car.  Was that what they hid in your room?  Whitney and I both got portable DVD players, then then we got a DVD recorder.  And cds, of course (Guster, Beatles, Counting Crows) and DVDs (all 5 seasons of Friends, Bruce Almighty, Finding Nemo, Ever After, couple of Beatles ones, etc.) and clothes.  Lots of clothes.  And PENGUINS!!! 6 to be exact.  2 stuffed (Hugsy and Fat Penguin) and then 3 figurine things, and then a penguin-shaped loofa thingy.  Kinda weird, but cute in it's own little weird way.  Oh, and Abby told me to tell you that I got penguin boxers.  They're from Aeropostale.  I got smalls, and they're huge.  I was like, wow,  small guy=big girl.  So what do the little puny guys do for boxers?  Cause there were definitely no extra-smalls.  Poor really-small guys.  And um, that's about it...   As if that wasn't enough.  Oh, yeah, a robe.  As if you care.

The only person that really knows what it is, is my dad, because he was watching me put it together over the past few days. It was late it coming, but I think it'll be worth it. It was finally finished around 10 this morning. Damn, shut me up. Check your email, B.  Merry Christmas, dudes and dudettes!

Damn, I love pictures! Dammit! I'm really serious.  I finished assembling Abby's present, Linds. To quote, "Boy howdy, is it neato!" I've actually been staying up til three in the morning with a purpose?!? My god!   Woo! Have fun, kids! And a Merry Christmas if I don't get back on, and considering that I think I'm getting some trick ass stuff, I'm thinking not.  Heh. G'bye for now, friends.

      Nod nod. I didn't think my first instance was correct, but I wondered.   Bleagh. I'm really downered. Yesterday I was coughing and I spit blood, which wasn't very fun (and yes Linds, Abby knows), and that wasn't too cool. And I'm just having a chemical imbalance in general from being sick. God I hate feeling this way. It's like being in a box full of rusty razors with no way out, ever.   Cough cough. That's why, right thurr. Fuck. I have stuff to go do. I just thought I would check and see how everyone else is doing.

      Brrr.  I was able to taste the tea until yesterday. Grr, I hate it. And now I've downed about two gallons and I haven't tasted the last one and a half or so.  Heh. Yesterday me, Spinks, and Alex were wrapping gifts at Border's for Habitat...that was really fun! The people were really nice, at least, they gave us really good advice on how to wrap stuff without giving us shit on how lousy we were doing. And even if they had, I would have just reminded them how much they were paying for it, and they could just take their shit and leave. It's not like we needed the dollar bills everyone was giving anyway. People are so damned cheap. But we made enough money so it was all good. It also reinforced the fact that I'm probably never going to hold a job if my life depends on it.   Oh, and one last thing, because it's troubling me.  I can't go into my room.  Yes, I know that's probably the weirdest thing you've heard all week. Supposedly, my dad bought me something for Christmas while we were in Chattanooga, and my grandmother and grandfather down there brought it up this weekend. Anyway, it's presently sitting in front of my door, in the middle of the floor...I've been told that it once breathed, but it doesn't anymore...I asked Katie if I could bring it back to life and she said no, but it would be funny if I tried. What the hell is it? And I can't go into my room! Grr! That means no getting dressed, no playing guitar/drums, no PS2, no...sleeping really. I've got the couch, and then the dogs are going to decide it would be fun to have a slumber party to their maximum comfort.  I'm scared. I don't like dead things in my room, or that I don't get to go inside until Christmas day in the morning. Or that my dad's making me leave for Chattanooga right after we get done opening presents. What kind of shit is that?!? He said we might not go. I hope he decides to "not have any feelings" like he says he does and keep us here. He said that he might not simply because he wants to "help me...play with...the thing in your room."  I hate Christmas. It's so commercial.  /Brrr.

      Okiie. I spelled okie with two i's. What are we, Finnish? Well, that's ok, but still!  I'm back! I lived the ultimate dream: heavy metal Love Shack by the B-52s on New Year's Eve in front of about two hundred people going, "What teh fook?" and the other ten or so going, "Woo, Hoshua is a sexy beast!!!" And David Romeo and Steven Jones were up tharr as well, they were instrumental to the end of the song. They didn't really know the words, but hey! We're all human.  It was lots of fun. I should tell you that further mail to myself, family, or Abby should be directed to Arizona as of about three hours from now. If only.  Time to sleep!, speaking of three hours, that's how much I got. Actually four, I was supposed to get three but I ended up sleeping in and causing problems! How much like the rest of my life eh?  Go aboot to look oot for them Canucks, eh.

      *bow* Congrats, finally. Well at least for now....yes, always, I am the addle-pated preacher.   Dudes, I fucking am so tired. I don't know what I'm still doing awake. I really don't want to sleep, is what...you know? I'm really tired and I think I'm going to die man, but it's just not in my card for me to go to bed yet. It's an odd, paradoxical feeling I thought I would share.  Anyway, my head is also buzzing with Arizona Raspberry Iced Tea (beats Peach Tea by a long shot...surprise!), which is manufactured in NYC, strangely. And also buzzing with Chester and his performance of  A Place For My Head . Seriously, palpatations, convulsions, spasms, laughing at the top of my lungs for about three hours since. My chest snapped as it constricted with Chester's awesomeness.  And dudes, what better, they're coming next month. I'm going, I asked Abby (kind of afraid of the pit...this is  a  pit, man, a real damn pit), we should all go. Damn, that would be slick. We would seriously all join the pit and get our asses kicked and love it. POD (big woop), Hoobastank (eh) and Story of the Year (who?) are opening. Damnit, I am excited. I should have never taken that CD when my dad put it in my hands. It's just too damn much. I haven't been this excited over music since I acquired my first old Metallica and wrote my first halfway-plausible song. It's that heavy. I'm going to shut up now, maybe it's the tea.  I'm going to bed, I think. Please forgive whatever the hell I said here, not even I know. I was needing myself to type some of the caffeine away. Farewell til Sunday.

      OK, I'll post, even though I'm about to call you and tell you what happened, just so it will be recorded when we're in college and look back at how crazy we were.  Anyway, so around 7:30 (like, right after Friends, which was incredibly convenient) he called, and there was the whole small talk thing for a little while, and then he was like "Look, I need to apoligize for something."  And playing the innocent, I go "Really?  What's that?"  And he's like "I'm sorry I've kinda been ignoring you and stuff (actually he used a word other than ignore, but I can't remember what it is, but it set a different tone which is why I'm mentioning it) but I do have a good reason.  When I was going out with Anne Marie, she broke up with me because she thought I was too clingy.  I just didn't want to make the same mistake and lose someone I care about."  Yeah, so after that he'd completely won all forgiveness and everything just because he was being so damn sweet, so I was like "It's ok!"  and stuff like that and then I said "But in all honesty, just forget everything Anne Marie ever taught you, because I'm like the exact opposite."  And he was like "yeah, I figured."  Then we set up a date for Saturday.  w00t.  Lots of fun, and I (semi) did it myself.  With a lot of help from Becca and Josh.  And I'm happy.  Which is really all that matters.

      Woo! I got ranted.  I think it's a big mistake having a middle man here, dude. If I had thought it would be a good thing, I would have said yes; but I figure if you're to the point where you can be gf/bf, this sort of mediation shouldn't be needed. And I know it sounds really parental and "Father knows best"ish, but I'm really of the opinion that no one can teach you things like this, and if they try to, you'll probably end up learning them wrong. I hope things work out OK in any case.  Some guy just came to the door, raising money for a wheelchair basketball team. I asked me how I was doing, I gave the standard, "Pretty good, you?" and then he paused, looked at me sort of ponderingishly, and said "Really good...actually." I thought that was a really cool answer, and I wondered what led to him being able to say that. I don't know why, I just thought I would share. We bought the book, by the way, and you should too. After all, my dad's disabled and  could  qualify to be on that team if he could shoot hoops and maneuver a wheelchair worth a damn. So buy it.  And Linds, keep on with your posts despite this, don't reply to that last part, pretend it's not there. I just had to put that down because it just happened and I wanted to record it.

      True, but remember who has set up the last (and only) two dates, who is the only one who has called the other (except for the whole directions thing), and the one to start the majority of the conversations in school.  You've got to talk to him.  I think I'm going to call you now even though I know very good and well you're on the phone with Abby.  I need to rant.  Congrats on being the rantee.

      I have no idea what his URL is actually. I just figured that's what happened...it's what I'd do/did. I'll roll some heads. I never really see Rob when you're not there. In the mornings he's playing Aetolia in the library. And yes, I could envision that to be a bit more than frustrating. I was, again, moreso unimpressed today than ever. I swear, he didn't even look in your direction, as if to see if you were looking in  his  direction, know what I mean?   I think the problem is that guys finding dating a girl to be really...I dunno, voliatile? I guess that's the best, albeit slightly offensive, word. We envision that if we do one thing wrong, it's all over. And we're very afraid to be pushy, too. At least some of us are. *shrug*  This is all from my perspective. You know what I think you should do, per your BLog; but that's never going to happen. I hesitate to say that it won't grow if he doesn't do anything soon, but I only hesitate. And remember, it takes TWO to have a relationship.  With extra emphasis on that last line, eh.

      I want the new URL!!!  If he's talking about me, I want to know what it says.  Not like I would give him my URL (you haven't have you?), by any stretch of the imagination, but still...  I vote you say something to Rob.  It's been a total of like two weeks of us being in school whilst dating and/or going out and/or whatever, and I don't think I've gotten even like a hug since then.  And everyone KNOWS I'm too much of a wimp to ever say anything.  *sigh* This is getting amazingly frustrating.  Roll some heads, Josh.  He considers you a good friend, so freaking talk to him.  Note: NOT while I'm in the room.  Talk to him when you see him in the mornings or something.  And don't tell him I told you to tell him.  You know the standard procedure.  God, I HATE GUYS!!!  (Not you, Josh.  You either, Will.  But that's probably cause I'm not planning on dating either of you in the next twenty years or so.)  But the rest of them are impossible to figure out.  He treated me more like a girlfriend BEFORE we went out.  He hasn't even bothered to set up a freaking DATE yet.  Such a puss, my God.  Josh, you thought you were bad... that was nothing.  Just talk to him please.  This is getting amazing frustrating if you couldn't tell by my little rant.  It's amazing how frustrated I can get at him and it still be impossible to get mad at him.  Even a little bit.  I think it's the dimple.

I mean, can't we add some interesting other word things in into it? Brr.  I think Rob changed URLs because he started talking about you on them, Linds. I was  not  impressed with Rob's behaviour today, tho I will definitely chance to ask what the hell "mirror flirting" is :), and if was  actually  relevent. He needs to start stepping it up or I'm going to cut some heads, bia.

      Yes, her husband cheated on her, ergo the nasty divorce.  Also, Josh, it was like the first thing he said to me.  Here's kind of how the conversation went.  Lindsey: Hey Rob: Hey.  (few minutes later) I have a question. L: I have an answer.  Let's see if they match. R: What's the answer? L: No, question has to come first, that's the way things work. R: I think we've come to that point in our relationship (blah blah blah)... Will you be my girlfriend.  Sorry about asking online, but I'm a wimp face to face. L: Of course, don't worry about being a wimp.  And then the convo took a turn so we weren't talking about that anymore.  And I was behind him on the way home and he smiled at me and made my day cause he kind of ignored my existence today.  I'm rambling, so I'll shut up now.  He hasn't posted on his blog in over a month now.  *Sigh*  Oh, well.  I'm off now that I've bored you all to death.

Did her husband cheat on her?

      Yeargh. I told ye so lass. Did you start him off, or did he just come around? In any case, salt in the wounds, and congrats!  I rerecorded some of the old classics at Nick Bruey's house today. Golly gee, that kid. I wonder if he's human. I really do. But we did some recording and got the musical backbone to  Painpainted  down, now are the excessively violent lyrics! There's actually going to be radio-edit of sorts so that the parentals can hear this masterwork.  But enough aboot me, eh. My mother has a broken ankle so we're having to fend for ourselves, pretty much, and for her, now that I think of it. But it's all good. We always have enough junk in here to sustain ourselves on. As long as I don't get fat, hey, I dun care what I eat. Not to say that I'm not fat, but still.  God, am I an egotist, I started talking about me again! Brr! Katie is being Katie. She got an MP3 player and is no longer listening to the family, so it's impossible to talk to her anymore. My dad's phone line is out, and he hasn't been heard from for the last three days or so. Hmm.  T-Mobile still being gay. I'm really hungry, surviving on Wendy's ( was surviving , it kinda ran out) and Abby's wonderful Christ o' the Mas chocolate chip cookizzles. And I think I need to go do some Sarah Bayrd. Now that you are all bored out of your skulls, I wish you all an excellent day.  Just read Rosie's post, so as a P.S.: he was referring to the car.

      Dudes.  So f-ing stoked about Spring Day it's not even funny. Hell, I don't care about the talent show, it's not like we're going to make it anyway...especially with Chimaira?!? But I think it's going to be amazing. There's a purdy clean Slipknot song I'd like to ask the dudes to do, and of course RATM (Freedom! Yeah right!) and other stuff. I think with one suggestion from all of us we could fill a purdy good set. And I don't think we'd get booted...well, that fast.  And for those of you who didn't know, Stranglebox has become no more. The new advent of that band is called  Choleric , but that one's sort of in the background as well.  So the present band is called  Pariah , an old project of Charlie Carr's and Adam Mauldin's that I happened to get asked into after that wonderful round of  Love Shack  in Arizona (Adam saw it and cried). And as of right now, Nick B. is in as well. It's going to SO ROCK IT HARDCORE STRAIGHT UP! Tell all your friends, Pariah ate your mother! Or something disturbing enough to grab attention just like that.  A happy rainy day and long weekend to all.

      Heya Linds. I hear it's all good now, and that's good to hear. And sorry for all the direness and shit, but it had to be done. "Don't kill the messenger," please? Rock, if so. Brr!, if not. I'll ask you what I needed to latr. And send the Stockwells my regards at the funeral; yeah, they don't know me, but I just feel really bad about the whole deal. I'm sure we all know the pain of losing something to death, it's far unlike other means of loss; it's really a moot point to go over that but it's more of a self-affirmation than anything else.  I am really hurting for rest. So I'll catch the majority of you cool cats laterways.

Nothing much crackin' on this side of the fence, so yeah. In closing, I read the ultimate "fuck you" Shakespeare-style in a book today.  "May your first day in hell last ten-thousand years, and may it be the shortest." Wow. If it wasn't so colloquial that would be an awesome thing to piss people off with.

Dude, everyone needs to go out and get Freschetta Oven-Baked pizzas. They cost a billion bucks but they are damn slick. I had that for din-din considering my mom is a cripple and doesn't really want to cook. It was that or another round of fast food, and my anorexia is suffering.

      Ours is some ghey junk about how life differed in the 1700s between the New Englanders and the Chesapekes, even though they were both English. It's sort of a tricky one but not entirely unmanageable.  Alright, as to the first part...hitting a latency stage at the moment, I just have to wait stuff out...wait for Eegee's to get here...go out to find that damn box...grr. I saw one with a picture insert thingy on top, but I don't have any pics to put in it, very sadly. Hmm. I've got plenty of time, tho. It's the first thing in about 16 years that I haven't procrastinated on, either, so I'm sort of happy that my motivation isn't being totally tapped. I don't see how it could, really.

      Gratze, dudes. It is cold.  Dude, Linds. I think I'm going to stop talking about V-Day unless you say it's alright. It's probably a painful subject on your end of the wire, so I'm going to cut it out. Plus, I talk obsessively about it, it seems, so no more.   I am really tired, and cannot wait for the stupid weekend to get here. Lord, let it come.  Hey, I did pretty good on the essay in Bayrd, I was pleased with myself. Our perios (yes, "perios", and Will can attest to the following) had really hard prompts. So I figure I'm almost set in that department. But as for English...stupid asshole Kelly...  Has everyone felt that extreme coldness that makes your damned fingers swell and you can't really do anything besides flex them irregularly? Man, that's me right now. I can't type either, and it's becoming annoying, so I'm going to quit trying.  Grr! and Brr!

I'm having problems with the box...the one I want is no longer about, and I'm really screwed. So we'll really have to see if that comes to be. Grr. But then I remember: a few weeks left. So it's all good. And my mom talked to the Eegee's people today, I think, so that's out of the way. All that's left is the dinner, the "after phase A", and the...um...parents. Eek, save me someone.

      I have a feeling she won't puke on your shoes.  Cry, maybe, but probably not puke.  If the jewelry box has drawers, I say leave it in the box inside one of the drawers.  That'd be the best way to do it.  If it doesn't have drawers, just do it separately.  I'm going to be out of town for Valentine's Day.  I just found that out.  I almost cried.  My one possibly good Valentine's Day...  Oh well, I'll be in Florida, but still.  I'd rather be here, me thinks.

Yes, I am damned insane, but I tried all the other places and didn't find anything I liked. Maybe I'll just scrap the boxes and leave the necklace in the jewelery box or whatnot? I dunno. And I still don't know what to do after "phase A." I've had some ideas, but eh.  I've known since I had the thought to even get the sucker in the first place from where I did, but wanted to make this all something special, because I love her. I may die, but it was all worth it. Heheh.  It's the least I could have done. Eh. I just hope she takes it and doesn't barf on my shoes and run home crying or something. And after "phase A," I'm not counting that out of the possibility spectrum. Heh, 'k not really.  Yazoo.

      You went to Jared!!!  I really can't believe that, Josh.  Are you absolutely insane?  She'll love it, but she'll yell at you.  You know she will.  She'll think you spent WAY too much on it, I can assure you.  And don't tell me you didn't.  If it came from Jared, you spent a whole freakin lot of money.  But she'll love it.  *sigh*  Yall are too cute.

      Naw naw, man. They're a bunch of Taco Bell-eating goners. Pariah is it, bia. They have hardcore drugs and cutting problems, that makes them the ultimate band. Not next to a bunch of loozersauruses jamming to old Metallica in some guy's yellow bedroom for about two hours, then going and setting off fireworks in said person's pocket.  Besides, I think it would be fun to be a full-time vocalist. Not that I can really sing, but that was never in the job description.

      Since the 13th of this month, no one but Lindsey and I have posted. What does it all mean? I don't know, but it's sadness, all the same. Not that I don't enjoy having monologues or talking to Linds, but it's just not the same, if you know what I mean.  But it's of little consequence. I've been with Abby for seven months today. Hasn't it seemed like about...I dunno, two? And a half, maybe? Aye. But nevertheless...she's still too amazing. It's hard to put out what I really want to say, I don't think there's any words for it.   Aye, I shan't trouble you with more o' my EMO kid rantings, no longer! Have a good weekend, everyone. I get to wake up early and bother rich people! And then, Antonio's with Abby, which should be very awesome. I have to think of something to do after that tho...hmm...And then...it's off to DKrik's Suicide Death Machine practice and SuperBowl Fun to the third power with Sethie, perhaps, on Sunday.  Arrivederchi for now, my kinspeople.

But he's not coming to church :(  One of his "buddies" (didn't tell me who though...) is coming over tonight to play video games or something.  Whatever.

      Eh, yes, I do know about the "you are such a GUY!!!" things, as a matter of fact. 'Tis a good phrase, that T-shirt is hilarious, if I wouldn't get pinned for being a total faggot I would probably buy and wear. MxPx has another good one along those lines, but it's more male-oriented, some girl pulling some dude's heart out...like, literally. It sounds gross but it just looks hilarious.  Why won't guys talk? I don't know. Do all girls want to listen? It's really a matter of some guys are different than others, some guys have learned or have been taught differently over time. Some guys just can't stand to hear themselves say it, because it just sounds really self-defeating and repetetive...I would tag any communication problems with that one there. Generally, we hate doing it because it means facing things we don't want to see, and going places we really don't want to go, and even if it's about facing them with someone you love and trust, we fear the depression that comes inevitably, we don't want to bring that on these people that we care about.  It's a really difficult thing, and honestly it runs a lot deeper than I know, and I live in it. But still...it's something I can more feel and outwardly talk about than to actually explain the schematics of it. Maybe he will come around, and maybe he won't. And maybe you'll get so fed up one day, that you'll tell him to talk and he will. Or maybe, it'll be the end of the both of you. Yes, it's back to those horrible concepts: time and patience. Things really just don't unfold like a picnic blanket most of the time...Abby and I did a lot of talking before we started going out, so it might have seemed like some instantaneous process, but it was a project in the works for some time. With you and Rob, you already have the relationship deal going, so you're trying to be the best you can for each other, and unfortuantely, that means putting up a lot of walls because you fear judgment. It's great that you all are going out, I think it could be fabulous for the both of you, but really, someone needs to open up here. Had we known things were going to work out this way from the beginning I would have said yeah, give it a couple of weeks before we decide to get things going...but it hardly works out that way, and didn't. So it comes down to, A. giving it time, or B. doing it yourself. Either of these have their strengths and fallibilities that I'm pretty sure you've already diagnosed or have known for some time now, mostly because we've talked about these before.  But again, the choice is yours. It's like the Matrix, man, "I can only show you the door; you have to step through it." It's dumb and over-noble souding to quote movies and all, but that one is to a tea. It's your reins to grab, here; or, to let go...but it's all as you see fit.

      I still want to read it, lamentations or not.  We might find something to do with it, you never can tell.    Yeah, the whole thing with Rob is kind of disappointing.  Sometimes I love him to death and sometimes it's just like an "Oh my God, you're such a GUY!!!" type of thing.  And that probably made very little sense to you because you ARE a guy, but it's really the little things that take us by surprise that we really love.  Oh well... boys are stupid, throw rocks at them.  I went to sleep when I got home and just woke up with that phrase in my head, so I had to put that one out there.  I just wish he would open up to me, you know?  It's been a month (and a day, not that I'm counting) now and I feel like we've just barely progressed from where we were a month ago.  And then there's the whole thing with what's going on in his life that he won't share with me.  I'm just so frustrated.  Why won't guys talk?  This isn't a hard concept.  Ok, I'm done for now and I'm quite sure you didn't understand half of it, but that's ok.

      Yes yes, that's exactly right. Messing with the masters, I couldn't have coined a better phrase. Not that I am a master, but it was the "master" copy and needn't be changed. Why couldn't we just write a new song? *cry* I have so many crappy little pop ideas waiting to surface!  Well, yeah. Um. Hmm. I'm glad that he acknowledged it and all even today, the day, uh, after. O wait, he didn't. Hahah. Sigh. A masterful letdown, I tell you what.  Well yeah again, and now it's four days and I don't think this letter is going to do it. I don't really write letters, I write stories when I do write...and this one is pretty much sounding like a story. The English is WAY too good, they probably won't believe that I wrote it. And I hate to be boastful, but it's really elevated shit...very educated and collected, almost colloquial at times. I mean really, who uses "lamentations" or "malaise" anymore. Lamentations, the Bible, grated. But "malaise," OLD OLD OLD. And I used it. And I can't do much about it now. So I give.  Let's all do a rain dance and hope to lordy we get out of school tomorrow! Hurray!

      I don't like the changing of lyrics from secular to Christian either.  Ask Abby.  At Breakthru and Lake Junaluska and stuff they do it and I'm sitting there shouting to the top of my lungs "NOOOOOOOOOO!!!"  Especially when it's a Beatles song... that REALLY makes me mad.  Why mess with the masters, you know?  Thanks, Josh.  Rather hard to believe he remembered, but there you have it.  He might just have a limbic system in there somewhere and we never knew it.  Ah, well, not like he acted on his knowledge, but close enough I guess.  I'm proud of you Josh.  Three days without Abby (without one of you being out of town) is hard.  And I'm proud of you for humbling yourself and writing the letter.  I'm sure you're doing the right thing.  Ok, enough mushy stuff, I know you hate, so I'll see you later.

      He actually did, me and Julian milked him for it, tho. Seriously, it was like, dead quiet in the room, and we were sitting there after he said, "Yah, it's like, one month today," and we kind of sat there yelling, "Hmm...I think he's on to us, Josh," "Yeah, you might have a point there, but it's great that he  remembered !" "Yeah, he suprised us all by not being a stupid dick for a change!" "Really!" Until Kelly shut us up. I hope he did something fabulous for ya.  So today marks three days without Abby...if this letter doesn't do the trick I think I'll have to bail Donnie out and see what we can do about the situation. And it probably won't because it's AWFUL! I sucked up the best I could, I just hope that's enough. And it probably won't be, I'll have to enclose a severed finger, three toes and a tongue for them to actually consider my lowly words...well, worst-case scenario. I hope they understand I'm not  actually  doing this because I give a shit about them a'tall. Grr. I want to be pissed really bad, but moreover I want Abby back.  I'm going to finish transcribing that letter and Christianizing  Painpainted  for the talent show. Come see us! Feb. 19 at 7pm in the Campbell Center! Well we haven't tried out yet, but if this song doesn't do it, then nothing really will.  We're having some problems, tho...mostly, Nick doesn't like Charlie, and Charlie doesn't like Nick...and sadly, I have to side with Charlie on this one. Nick is really trying to grab too much fuckin' harness on this one, i.e.: including Matt Leper...that's three guitars, um...a bit of overkill there. And Charlie could just as well "bring the Death" like we need it. So we're all rather pissed, sort of. Me, mostly cuz I have to change my damn song. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Christianity, I actually quite enjoy the idea, but changing lyrics...NOOOOOOOOO. No no no no. Bad.  Peace, homies.

      Congratulations.  You have just made a world record for shortest post ever made!!!  Anyway, apparently Rob had plans for Valentine's Day.  We were walking out to my car and suddenly he's like "It's too bad you're going out of town for Valentine's Day.  I had something planned."  So I asked what he had planned and he said he couldn't tell me because he was going to do it next Valentine's Day.  Thought that was interesting.  Not that I mind him looking to the future or whatever, that's good, just... I don't know.  Struck me as odd.

      At least I'm hoping so. My mom read it too, she was like, "If this doesn't do it, they have no soul." That's the third time I've heard that phrase today, and third time=the charm... so ...  Really scared. Not only that, but the tryouts tomorrow, probly other junk that I forgot. Honestly I'm going to have to create another personality to keep up with it all.  Farewell, friends.  Oh yes, and the movie was excellent, and I already toldja but there would be a big gaping hole in the BLog had I not answered. !!

      Hope the movie was good, Josh.   Yeah, so me and Rob are fine now.  See, the whole "non-confrontation" thing works.  And I told him the wholeish Ryan story, so that's all cleared out.  Now just to find out about him...  Anyway, the letter was absolutely amazing.  They McLemores are sub-human if they don't accept that as appropriate apology.  I'll get it back to you tomorrow so you can send it.  I hope you don't mind, but I let my mommy read the letter, and she says that you should send it and that the McLemores will understand that people make mistakes, but that you have breached their trust and that this is a good step toward fixing it.    So there you go.

      Dudes, the Wasteland is the trippinest poem ever, I   I just had a thought, speaking of (ramblings, if you'd like to stop now)...about "bringin' the death" metal. Now that I think about it, I don't really know why I like it...mostly, I just do. It really takes a special appreciation to be able to listen to it and enjoy it. Everyone, on some level of consciousness or another, knows that all it really is is a big wall of sound, some guy screaming until his vocal cords collapse, blaring guitars founded on the same three or four power chords (differently arranged for each song, of course, we need to look like musicians), drums...well...they're insanely fast, some bands, like Nile, you can't really tell they're actually keeping time, it sounds like he's just nailing the fuck out of the closest skin he can get to.   But still, I guess it preaches to those wonderful unconscious aggressions we try so hard to keep to ourselves. Perhaps our enjoying it is a facet of our expressing said aggressions in a passive way. Mostly all the real dmetal listeners I know are pretty placid with the world, since they purge the aggression each time they press the play button.  Just a little philosophical rant that had occurred to me on some level today. Peace, everyone.  And if you talk to me before, say, the beginning of next week, don't make fun of me. I sound stoned/really really old.

      To quote Billy..."mmmmm" pancake dinner. O yah they're great, I haven't done that in a couple years tho, so I don't know how it'll be. But if they have strawberry syrup then  OK  because strawberry syrup=the definition of ambrosia of the gods. I'll go if Abby goes, of course, so fill me in as it becomes appropriate.  I don't have a headboard! Har har har. I took it out a while back, so I don't think it's a problem. But if I did have one, it would be facing the door pretty much, so would that count?  OK, two slight yet very gay riddles. And Will, you can't answer, because you know. Let's see if ye gifteds can figure it out.   SO. There a guy who wants to get across a bridge that has a weight capacity of 245 lbs., and he weights 235. The only problem is, he's got three 5 pounds balls with him...of course, 235+15=250, and that's bad for him. So...the question is: how does he get them across? And by the way, he can't lose weight, cut off a limb, project the balls across the bridge, take another bridge, or use the boat, he has to have the balls with him when he crosses. How does he do it?   Someone asked me this one today and it took me forever to get it, but it came. And no major physics equations here, it really doesn't matter so much.  Woo!

      Man, I dunno, that game's publisher always has it so you can change roles (male and female of course). Then again, guys in Japanese games are pretty nerdy as a rule, they would be taking that old Victorian "ooh! *blush*" role that women normally do, either that or they cain't speaka no English well good. But 'tis discrimination, what if I'm a homo or a sexist and I must play with a same sex character? I could be a heterophobe or something. That would be a good court case if it could be believably justified. But at this rate, I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty of studs in the near future.

      Hell yeah dude, I'm sorry you couldn't go dude. What's a Zamboni? Are you serious?!? Heh. It's a little ice-smoother-thinger they use during breaks in the game. Basically it goes really slow and makes the ice look shiny again, and it's actually quite loud when you're right next to it. Gratz on Rob privileges man. Speaking of, if I can get some Abby privileges then all will be set with the world, man. Today/tomorrow is 8 months! It depends on how you consider February to be, and I figure March 1 is more like it. I dunno, I'll probably get yelled at for not calling tonite...grr, Blonder...eh. Man, I really need to shut up.

And we  won , thank GOD, it's the first organized sports event I've been to in a long time where the team I was going for actually won. And what a win it was.

      both ideas sound good, any time our moms spend hanging out is less time she can be yelling at me, and any new screaming methods will be appreciated because I can practically tell her what she is going to say befroe she does so and it's getting pretty boring.

      Here's a little rant, read it or not, I just needed to get it off my chest.  Parents are so funny.   If I was left alone I would probably get so much more done.  However everytime I start down to do something I remember how I was told to do it.  Whenever my mother speaks to me she uses a tone which I can best describe as the same tone one would use to a muddy dog whom just tracked mud throughout the entire house, including the vacuumed carpets and mopped floors.   How my mother even knows about these tones is unclear seeing as she never vacuums or mops.  And when I say every time I mean every time, such as "Good job, Will on your 99th percentile on (insert standardized test here)" and "Do you want to help me with scouts tonight" and who could forget "Fix [this computer that isn't working because I decided to try to play every game that I could find online and tried to get at least six trojans to detonate in less than ten minutes and no one but me has been on in at least two weeks so I am the only one who could have possibly caused these problems] NOW!!!" So after responding in kind I get screamed at for "yelling when I have not been yelled at" and "Never showing her any respect."  Would someone please tell me when it was that people felt that just on the fact that they have wasted more years of their life they deserve respect.  I have notice that lots of the people I have dealt with this year don't believe that respect is earned, but given to all "superiors" (people whom have less time left here because they spent it jacking off). So every time I start something productive that my mom told me to do, I grate at it continously.  How this is supposed to get me to do anything well.  It really does hurt my grades, think everytime I start to actually do homework or study or read or anything I just remember her screaming that I'm a spoiled shithead not worthy to kiss her feet and that my total worth is less than that damn non-existant dog that tracks mud on floors in other people's house.  What the fuck is her rational behind this god damn tone.  Well at least this has one up side, I won't have much trouble adjusting to college life, seeing as it can only be better than this hell. thanks Mom, really I'm grateful for you making my life one big living hell.

      PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE talk to Rob and Gossett about prom THIS WEEK.  I'm serious.  Abby and I are going to be EXTREMELY mad if this doesn't work perfectly.  This is her night to be treated like a princess and I won't have you screwing it up.  Get the message to Rob and Gossett, that applies to Amber and me too.  Here's what you need to do:  1) Talk to Gossett and Rob about splitting a limo (remember this is April 17), and then book it.  We won't need a stretch probably, just one big enough to hold 6 people.  It needs to be at my house at 5:30.  Make sure the guys know that everyone is coming to my house beforehand, around 4:30 for people's parents to take pictures, etc.  Yall can just leave your cars here and then after prom the limo can bring us back and my mom will have a "midnight breakfast" thing fixed.  The girls will spend the night and the guys will leave about 2:00 or whenever yalls parents want you home.  2) Make reservations at Carrabba's for six people at 6:00.  That will give us about an hour and 45 minutes to eat, so we can leave about 7:45 and have about 20 minutes to get to the factory so we can make a fashionably late entrance (we don't want to be the first ones there).  3) Remember (and remind Rob and Gossett) to order (wrist corsages for everyone is best) corsages at least a week in advance.  You will want to coordinate with your date's dress.  Abby's dress is hot pink, so you'll want to tell the florist that.  They're pretty good about helping you coordinate.  I'll try to get her to give you a swatch of the fabric to give to the florist.    4) Get measured for and order a tux ASAP (like, say, this weekend, since I KNOW you have nothing going on since it was going to be a DI weekend) because otherwise they'll be all gone and you'll be stuck.  Go with something pretty classic and you'll be safe.  Please please PLEASE don't dress really outrageously.  Now is not the time to be funny.  That's a great way to make Abby and her mother mad.    5) Relate all this info to Rob and Gossett.  And get ALL this done SOON.  If you wait any longer, there will be nothing available and then you will be left with three incredibly angry girls on their prom night.  It's not a pretty sight.  So please get everything done in the next week.    6)  If this stuff isn't done by the end of the month, I'm serious Josh, we are getting yall's parents on your case.  And don't print this out because it'll make me look like a real witch.

      Dudes, I am the best drummer ever. I went and jammed a few minutes ago...ok, 45 or so...and it totally made my house fall down with its obscene coolness. Now I'm waiting for my right arm to quit being mega-huge, so I thought, "how bout a post".   Linds, is she going back tomorrow? Looking at the calendar just a while ago the thought had occured to me that it's about time.  Hmm. My guts are ablaze, the meds have stopped working altogether. Grr. I hate me. I wish I could speak guts, because they're saying something really interesting right now.  This weekend was cool. I made spaghetti last night that turned out really well...we made a bit much tho, so da will be having fun with wheat and cow for the next three days or so, I'd gather.  Bleh, I feel really wasted. I think I'll blame Kelly.  I'm not sure about the shelter. You know about girls and guys with puppies...I get hit on a lot, it's not very comfortable. Eh, but I like the place so. I don't know. Maybe I can stand it since it's only on Saturdays, with the puppies and stuff. Why don't these girls understand that when I use the "girlfriend" word in context with the simple sentence and article, "I have a", it means it's time, rather than giving me your phone number, to walk away? Sigh. I don't know, this is a not cool feeling, and I thought I would be EMO and rant it here. Grr, I was just doing my job. Grrr. I hate people sometimes. Alright, now I'm cool.  Time to go get some markers! Peace.

<date>02,June,2004</date>
<post>

	 
      I don't think he does, at least not one in circulation,lets see;  penny-Lincoln Nickel-Jefferson Dime-FDR Quarter-Washington Half-dollar (no longer minted in any amount)-Kennedy dollar-sacajawea (don't care about spelling) dollar-susan b. anthony dollar-washington five-Lincoln ten-Hamilton twenty-Jackson fifty-Grant hundred-Franklin  look at that list, whom seems to be the least likely for people to actually recognize?  I think Grant and Hamilton possibly Anthony, the rest seem to be fairly recognizible.  I also understand why Hamilton is on the bill, he was the father of the national bank. and Anthony is a concession to feminists, but grant is the weakest link there.  it makes no sense.  Though, it might be that he made bankers so rich they decided he should be on their money because he helped them get it.  Who knows?

      Yeah, and has there ever been such a scandal-ridden administration?  Maybe that was the reason...  The only less qualified candidate I can think of is LBJ.  I think that Eisenhower should be on the fifty.  He was a good guy, and as far as I know he doesn't have a bill or coin.  But I may be wrong on that.

      ita vero means yes indeed.     but I would rather have Franklin Pierce on the fifty, or how 'bout some people whom might actually deserve it, maybe Wilson, Ike, Monroe, Teddy R., or anyone other than Grant.  What did Grant do to get on the bill?  (Seeing as no one else is going to know the answer to that.)  He signed into law a bill that devalued the currency and appointed the head of the commission that instituted these changes.  Oh, yeah, he also was a lousy guy.  Sounds like a great person to have on such a valuable piece of paper.  Bureaucracy is fun!

      hmm... because the dime is in circulation a lot more than the fifty, so it's not how much they're worth, it's how much they're circulated.    Thanks for livening the blogs.  The were dying.  What does ita vero mean?

      Jefferson is but it's an awful picture of him.we visited fort donelson (in land between the lakes, site of a union victory during the war of northern aggression) this weekend and watched the Nationl park service's little video on it and I quote "there come little moments in whcih the fates of countries rest on one man's decision, one such came after the first confederate assault, and the confederate generals bickered over the approiate course of action. but Brant, grant's moment cameand he barely waited a moment before he decided '(some blatantly obvious piece of advice that reminded me of 'let's use fedex')' I hate it when something is so blatantly biased against the area in which it is presented.

      Sigh. So tired. Katie left her alarm on so...at about 5:30 this morning Jessica Simpson comes wailing thru the hall and into my room. I didn't much go to sleep after that. I had myself convinced that it was Friday and it was time to get up, and then, navigating through ways how it couldn't be Friday, I finally remembered the play and putting up signs and disengaged the panic switch. But eh, 5:30. And bed at 1. I'm too old for this shit.  And Happy Tales just had to be mega-boring today...stupid Mainstreet Festival. God. There was practially no one there. I did three adoptions today...the last time I was there, I did twelve. So you can imagine what you have to do the whole time to keep your eyes open...anything, really. The dogs get tired and sit down, the ladies are all pretty old so they'll sit and talk about good old old people things, people will come in and leave pretty fast...blah. And now it's time for a good old paper. I hate this weekend. Yay for SAT IIs next weekend. Shit.  Raugh.

      Dude, I'm about to be a hardcore kid. I'm writing a lot of new stuff with titles that could really be hardcore names of songs. Random. Perhaps a renewal of good old Stranglebox? One never knows.  I should just make a band called Chandler Cult and indulge my ego therein. That would be a good name for a hardcore band, actually. I think I will.  xXwowXxxXhardcoreXxxXisXxxXawesomeXx

      Well dude, with a modest blush and deferential nod of the head, it was my pleasure. I figure if I could be there, I might as well be there, and so I was. And it'll be fun watching you own up, because those signs truly OWN (especially the bumblebee yellow-and-black one). Ask again any time man, I'll be happy to oblige...it's what I'm here for.

      I suppose. I don't take her for much of an overestimater, though. A tad bit of a dreamer, but that wasn't e'er a crime, so far as in my book.  Hmm. Well, what's been going on lately. I'm in a really EMO mood, so I should probably make a long post and tell you all to ignore it (but that actually means, read it thuroughly and tell other people that I'm depressed, too). Actually no, take it as you will; it's sort of like writing lyrics in the BLog, it doesn't change anything, but it gives a certain sense of...something. I really can't remember since I haven't posted any in quite a while. I might put down one of my newer works for the public perusal...it hasn't been recorded yet, but it'll pretty much tell you where I'm coming from.  Hm, well. So yesterday I sat on the phone with my dad talking about how apathetic I've become to everything, how nothing really seems to be doing it anymore. I started out the whole call by saying, "I wasn't asleep, just being dysthymic," and I guess that's how it all got started. I've been feeling it creeping up for the last couple of weeks...it's a scary feeling, kind of, but at the same time, it's really familiar and comforting. It's a honest paradox, but that's the only way I can explain it. I really want to get out of whatever this is, but I cannot.  It's horrible because...well, you all know me. I'm the type of person that says, "If you aren't willing to help yourself, then I won't help you." And here, all of the sudden, I try to help myself, and nothing seems to work. I keep asking myself why, and none of it makes any sense. I try to cover it up by doing a thousand things, but I really don't care. It's to the point of knowing and believing I have a lot of great friends to help me, but just not caring. It's like I'd rather be down here where I am, where everything around me is going to die or leave sooner or later.   Again, it's been going on for the better part of two weeks, probably before that, but I'm not super-crazy into looking back that far. I just haven't felt the same about things, nothing really gets me up, it's just flat, or it's sinking. I mean, how sad is this: I'm listening to  Glass In The Trees  by Dead Poetic the other day, and I couldn't help but just stopping the car and scream-crying at myself for about five minutes...god, this feeling.   I know a lot of things I can do to help it, I just can't right now. I really need some time off, first of all; second, I need to talk to Abby about a lot of things, third, I need to talk to my mother, fourth, myself...eh. Sometimes I wonder if any of this is going to help. Actually, all the time I wonder if anything is going to work. As I type this post I don't feel that familiar twinge of fear like I used to with Leigh Anne, I just feel flat...really flat, like a cardboard box with an elephant on it flat.   I guess this is better than being upset about everything...like last night, lordy. I felt like I was never going to get out of that, and like I would never pass out and just kill the pain for a while, until I could readjust the chemicals and wake up the next morning.   Man, that sentence I wrote in English today, I thought about it, after giving myself the guilt trip for making a stupid sentence (how predictable), and said, "man, this is what I sound like all the time now." Even my happiness is sad stuff. And the hardest thing is explaining it to anyone, because I'm really afraid of what might happen if I do. I think my dad took it alright, he's a really good guy, and he's pretty much been through it all, he doesn't think anything is weird or crazy anymore. But yeah...explaining this is a nightmare. It's like, first, let's tell the story of how it began, and then the story of how it really kicked in, and all the residual aftershocks from last year, and the obsessive thoughts, and the things I do to try and calm myself, and all the guilty thoughts and the guilt in general. First of all, does anyone really want to listen to this, and second of all, why? Not even I do. Then again, if I wasn't hearing any of it, I probably wouldn't be sitting here typing this. Sigh.  I think I think too much, that's what's causing all this. I just don't know. I really just want to sleep a long time and not face anything, just have it face me. Aie, this is suffocating.  It's nice to let it out though, it's something I rarely do anymore, I sort of save til the appropriate blow moment....it's sort of a bad idea. Hm. Well.  I'm tired, so I'm going to go to bed now. It's been a long time since I made a good semi-EMO post, and that was a pretty good one. Yeah.

      Hahaha, well that's not very nice, even if it is 100% true. Yes Whit, I have seen this nickle you speak of, it says "Louisiana Purchase" on it and has a tomahawk or something on it, right? I have a friend that found one and has become very, very proud of it...actually, it's kind of scary how much he cherishes five cents. I hope you had a good confirmation! Linds, why were you freaking out?  Wow, nobody posts anymore. Like, really, not at all. I haven't checked Linds's yet, but I'm going to go out on a limb and make a big guess about the status over there.  I hate me.

      Dude.  That seriously made me EMO tear all over the place, and I can't thank you enough. It's been...rough the past couple of weeks. Out of a possible two-hundred negatives I could have picked to describe myself at the shrink yesterday, I got 178. That in itself told me a lot about where I'm coming from, and the fact that I can't see through anyone's eyes except my own, and it hurts to do it. I really try to control these thoughts and think things differently, but every time I try I just get myself more down. I know this isn't a Leigh Anne situation, and I'm trying so hard not to put it in that light, but sometimes...it's hard to fight the past, especially when it's so close.  It's only been a year since I broke that off, almost literally. It was sometime in early April. One of the biggest things troubling me is the fact that some things that are troubling me, are. They shouldn't be anymore. But I have a lot of shit to work out in myself.  But really....thank you for this. And I'll try to keep my face...sometimes I just don't know how. "You're either manic and high or depressed and down," says Bright Eyes. Sometimes I feel like that, thinking that scares me into submission, too. But I really appreciate your being here. I just really hope I can make it out to the other end in one piece. What you said was perfect, I just need to take it to heart and try to apply it. God...we'll see.  And you know, I'll always come to these things, and I'll always be here, because you're there for me. Life hasn't been all so bad as I say when I think about it and all the people that have made it a million times more colorful than it should ever have been, and you've contributed so much to that. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

      Wait, I said that she'd lost interest in you? What?  Definitely not the biggest deal, let's focus.  Listen, Josh.  Abby loves you.  She may not be acting like it right now, but in all honesty, that's her deal.  Right now she's way too caught up in her own life to be able to see past it and into yours (or mine, but once again, not quite the point.)  Truthfully, I really haven't talked to her enough in the past month to really know what's going on, but I do know that yall are in love and that's just not something that fades away that quickly.    I do know that making a big deal out of Abby's lack of insight is not going to make the situation any better.  Just don't obsess about things that don't matter in the long run.  I promise you, girls think about things a lot differently than guys do.  With us, we can do anything as friends that guys would perceive as a "date" or whatever.  I promise you, Abby would never in a million years do anything she thought would hurt you in any way.  Is she in an incessantly bad mood right now?  Yes.  Is she able to see past her own problems right now?  No.  I've pretty much faded into the background the past month.  Remember her calling you and telling you that I was completely ignoring her, blah blah blah?  Yeah, right here, right now.  I haven't really talked to her in forever it seems like.  But she's still my best friend and I still love her.  I do understand the whole feeling of despair, though...quite unfortunately.  And I'm really sorry you're back feeling that way again.  That's sucks infinitely.  But listen to me: you aren't doing anything wrong.  If anything, you're doing stuff that is very right.  You've been there for me when even Abby couldn't be.  You've loved me when I couldn't love myself, and forced me to look at things from your persective.  You are the perfect boyfriend, the perfect son, and the perfect friend, even if most of us can't see it all the time.  You are my brother, Josh.  I look up to you and respect you more than any one else I can think of.  Your advice and compassion and support has gotten me farther in this world than I ever dreamed possible.  I don't know what I would have done these past couple of years without you.    But please, Josh, don't let this get you down into another Leigh Anne situation.  It really shouldn't- there's no Leigh Anne situation to pull you down, only your perception of one.  Every couple goes through rough times; this is just one of the rockier ones that yall will eventually either through and be closer than ever before.  Don't be ashamed that you're feeling the way you do- just know that not everything is exactly the way you think it is.  You are so awesome, Josh.  Thank you so much for coming tonight- that really meant a lot, especially since my family couldn't be there.  You have been so wonderful to me over the past couple of years- I'm not sure I'll ever be able to thank you enough or repay the debt.  Knowing you has changed my life, and I'm so grateful it has.    If you ever need to talk, you know I'm always here.  My door's always open, my phone is always on, and you are always welcome.

      It seems like it, she's still really tired though, and that never comes out on the other end well. Hmm but...maybe the Lindsey Reid prophecies came true and she just lost interest in me? I remembered yesterday when you said that a really long time ago...actually, I remember you saying that awhile before I met her, and I was like, "Hmm, pleasant...", not knowing what was going to come as a result.   Gr, what's with this residual Leigh Anne paranoia? I'm jumping from shadows in the middle of a sunny, empty field...I feel guilty about it, but honestly...how are you supposed to address something like that without making the other person jump at you, or feel guilty themselves, or generally just pull down your relationship in one way or another? And considering our present communications record....uhm...well.  Sometimes I hear about all these other guys and I flip. I hear that's what happens when you're dating a girl, all sorts of guys try to get up on your turf, so to speak. But jeezus. Like, one week, we had to cancel because of her sister coming over, and then the next day, when I was out of town, two guys come over to watch a movie...I was sort of like, "Well, alright..." and  then , the thing with Reiners (sp?) and yes, I know, I understand what happened, but it just kills me, it's all making me nuts.  God, maybe it's just all this end-of-the-year anxiety? I guess this is why I'm going to a shrink tomorrow, it's gone from accentuating the negative every once in a while, to pretty much every chance I can get, and with everything, especially relationships (not just the b/f-g/f kind, either). God. So long as I can stop asking myself "What am I doing wrong?," I'll take whatever they want me to. Am I doing something wrong? What the fuck.  So hey, let's brighten the atmosphere with some lyrics from your favorite one-man band, who has been very busy as of late, of course. I haven't made one of these in aeons, but hey, what are BLogs for besides huge EMO posts? Here's a good one. "I wrote this one when I was really depressed." It's called  Apart  and it's really different from stuff I'd priorly written, but a lot of this is, I've changed a bit since last year. So here goes.  I'm falling apart here Did you see the pieces? I wish I could feel this like you I hate the innocence that sleep gives A mask for all the traitors trying To quiet down their abuse  And so long as I cover this Maybe you'll stand with me And we can just fake that This world is wrecking me All I've ever wanted  Is to be perfect just like you And then maybe I'd know  Why I hold this guilt that I do not own Why the sharpest blow crushes all of the bones Why are we falling apart?  Decepted by this insolence I wonder what I haven't got to yet I wonder how I could be so enamored To this fate, instead of one that lives  I am surrounded by fakes and abandoners Turn their heads when the action won't benefit You have taught me that my every redemption Lives in this never-fade rift  Why I hold this guilt that I do not own Why the sharpest blow crushes all the bones Why are we falling apart?  ...and I'm pretty sure there was more, but hell if I know where the sheet is. There's a mount about 12,000 feet high of papers on my bed about now. Hmm. Somebody help me out here, I'll give you a cookie.

      I think she's doing better- at least for a while.  She seemed to be in a (semi) better mood when she brought over the swotch.  I don't understand what's gotten into her lately.  I really don't.

      Sigh. What a damned day. So apparently I find out the shit's hitting the fan in some respects or another. And coming from once being the Bad Girlfriend King, big problems don't even out well in my head. Bleh.  I just want to know where I stand in all of this, or what's going on that all of this is happening. And if it's bad, may it be relatively quick and painless.  Time for US History, hip fucking hip hurray.

      We had a puppy this weekend. Granted, he was a HUGE puppy, even being two months old, but he was a sweetie. I don't remember his name. But I do remember that he didn't get adopted, and that sucks. But he will sometime this week, I bet. People just can't resist puppies.

      Hmm. I really don't know how to start this post without saying "I'm really depressed." So here goes:  I'm really depressed.  This is the worst kind of hurt I could ever think of. I could seriously read back over the shit I went through last year and long for it. Nothing ever hurt so bad as right now. What am I doing that's making everything so weird? It seems to be happening with everyone, some more than others. Why hasn't anyone told me?  But I suppose this is my fault. I knew this was happening, I could feel it. It's those things I say that take every conversation down until you hit that really strange silence part, the "what do I say to that" portion of it.  I know that I have potential, but I'm really having a hard time seeing how to manifest it. At least right now. I'm sitting at my dad's house and wanting to scream, to do something. To find the answer that doesn't have a question. That's exactly what depression is. Or rather, numbness.  For those that don't know, I was diagnosed with severe depression the other day, and they put me on Lexapro...I'm still trying to adjust to it, and it's going to take some time. But during that time, they say, things are going to be worse. Boy howdy, they are. I seriously had to talk myself into getting out of bed this morning. I had to find a rubber band so that I could stop the horrid thoughts for a few seconds and figure out how to open my door and start the shower. You know, the rubber band approach. You think something bad, you snap yourself. Does it work? For me, sometimes. I guess it did this morning. I managed to leave my house and come here.   But ladies and gents...ah. The burn, I can feel it all over again. I woke up with it this morning. I know what it is now, but it still hurts more than anything. I wish I wasn't me.  I don't know what I would be instead, but if I could be something, this wouldn't be it. I don't have an identity. Or do I, and am I just so depressed that I forgot? I don't know. God.  I need sleep, so much sleep. I get insomniatic when I'm really depressed or stressed out. Hence, I haven't been having the greatest days lately.   Guys...I don't know. I think I really need to reexamine my relationships with everyone, I need to see how far this has gone. Actually, I think I know, so now, I just need to figure out how to change it. Please, give me some time. I know, I know, that's going to get old, I've asked everyone, I've asked Abby, I've asked my mother, everyone, but please, just wait for me. I don't know what I'll do without all of you.

      Raugh. Gaddis sure knows how to be a true asshole. I didn't really know it til he busted it out hardcore. It's one more reason to quit that shit, or splinter with JH, Andy, and Romeo, and start a hardcore/thrash/ska band. Either that, or go straight up hardcore with Palmer and just forget this. If only I could actually write hardcore. Shit.  Anyway, I'm so tired I could cry. They put me on Lexapro today, I really hope this shit works, because elsewise I'm going to probably die of fatigue or irritability at shit not working the way it's supposed to. I need a fucking vacation. AAAUGGGHH (brains hit the floor)  *whimper* Sleep. Fuck Bayrd. I'll worry about it tomorrow.

      Lordy, BLog's all weird again. But I like the post counter thing. Linds, you're beating my ass. Weird font. Augh. I'm supposed to be printing out Bayrd sources. What a slacker art I.  Well, this weekend hasn't turned out all that bad. I've done a lot of thinking about things, I think I have a start on what I want to say to Abby and my mom, I talked with my dad for a long time (5+ hours), we came to a lot of conclusions, tears, etc. It's a pretty cool thing walking in on two guys EMO tearing together. I drank Coke and sat against the security door, he sat on a chair across the kitchen and sipped some water. And man, all that from saying, "Can we talk later?" Something gives me the feeling that because of that, things are going to start to get better. And that simple phrase made the balance of 3 years' misery diminish and start to die. Well, alright, and there was five hours of talking, but the catalyst wasn't a total breakdown or anything. I think I like this method a lot better.  Hey, what can I say? Even I'm starting to feel a little better. I hit rock bottom the other day, sure. It's not everyday you almost break up with someone you love and are trying to get back to somehow. Finally, I can sort of stop the obsessive thoughts, I can rationalize my cognizance somewhat...rational-emotive, what a charm. I'm really hoping that life, after taking a big turn towards a tree for a while there, is starting to turn back onto the highway and pressing the gas to get the hell out of this town. It's just that these pills make me damn sleepy. Sigh.  Well...I don't know what to say. Today was a pretty good day. I was able to sit in quiet places and not freak for a change, I thought things through and wasn't totally catastrophic in all the outcomes. I may just be learning to trust people. It seems like such a turnaround, but I have a lot more to go, I know. But the turnaround gives me some place to start, thus: hope. And who couldn't use a bit of that now and then? I really hope things do turn about. God, I have a lot of catching up to do.  I really wonder why I shut up and let things slip by. Actually, I wonder what gave me away. Hm. Yeah, it's all sort of centered around Abby right now, that's one of the biggest problems in my head right now, but I don't feel hopeless about it for a change, I feel like we can actually make some progress now that all, or most, of the bullshit is cleared out of the way. God, I came so close, we came so close. I really love that girl, I wouldn't just let her go that easy. Linds has said that girls get into relationships looking to change the guy a bit...I could use it. That was random, I forgot why I put it (it had a point). Hmm. I just don't have enough time. Things need to be 100% now!  Ah well, I'll just do psychology tests in the meantime. Those things make me feel thrilled.  And I'm still working on that omelet, Linds. I'm trying to find a good recipe and some time to make it, but man, the goal is going to be fulfilled. And next, to key an asshole's car. Not for any mundane reason. I'm looking for an asshole parked in a handicapped space without tags or a window dealy or whatnot. I've always wanted to do that, and now I'm going to. I don't know what the city codes say about emus, but hell with it. They're too dumb to cause any damage, the poor buggers.  Go see Army of Darkness, it's the funniest movie ever!

I love you and so does Becca. Reach out to one of us please. Talk Therapy, though seemingly pointless, does affect how one feels. Smile alittle, the sun is out.

      I sometimes wonder, as I do right now, what the fucking bleeding hell I'm doing.  Here I sit clicking my life gone once again, ever acknowledging with each and every breath in the Turkish philosophy sense of the words, that I am dying this very minute, and that every breath I exhale, and everytime the blood in my heart delivers that wonderous life-giving oxygen to the rest of my body, every goddamned time, it's inevitably meaning one more stroke of the steel to the flesh, one more beat that causes this flesh irrevocable damage, the beat shall never return, the damage, however small, is leading us onward inevitably towards that black, aching pit called death with no light, no future, no sounds. Only silence and the grim realization that the past, just as the future and the present, are truly nothing. That the very whim of creation was to take life and let it make choices, mostly ones that would destroy it, and then lead it to black at the end of its time, from whence it came, and where it all will inevitably wind up.  Death.  It feels the same way at this moment, as it did when I put my mouth on the end of that 45 and dropped that goddamned baggage for a few seconds, the wonderous beauty of liberation, and the horror of clarity, that life is a pit, and we are the bastards deemed to find the bottom, in life or without life, but inevitably, we will reach the bottom; some of us will taste it before we meet it, and some of us will hit it before the rest of ourselves can catch up. Some of us just weren't meant to see the clear and the wonderful I hear about. Some of us are made to prematurely taste the bottom because nature says there has to be a balance. If the world were without people that weren't fixated on their own destruction, it would mean a race of people engaging nature and fully working against it, a species that would inevitably rise above the confines of nature.  They put the ones alive on the bottom here so that we are inhibited as a whole, not all of us will unite, we are the ones to show everyone else their own eventual damnation. We were put here to circumvent rising above nature, and nature does this by utilizing our most potent and, in the man-beast sense of the word, only tool: our very minds. Our minds were bred of destruction for survival, the art of survival is destruction. Some of us may only compensate for the full awareness of our inevtiable demise by cutting ourselves in the mental sense, thereby achieving equalibrium again: you cut, you rise back above, you sink back down. Balance through imbalance.  Yet nature doesn't take into account that its scales may be unevely weighted. Equalibrium comes with acceptance: we have a choice to accept this middle ground or not, which, sadly, a great few of us do not, and of those great few, there are varying degrees of non-acceptance. Many who believe themselves to be upon the middle ground do not take this into account, and thereby further incriminate and induce self-destruction upon those that cannot accept their constant exposure to inevitability.  I came into this world with a choice: the choice to live, or the choice to die. I have taken a long, subjective look at this world and everything it stands for, how it lives, how things work within it, how things are carried out, how we breathe, how we survive, everything about it I have surveyed for as long as I can stand, and I have decided that, though I continue and will continue to stand among the living, I choose death, because death is my fate, death is my perception, death is the only option to those who have felt the bottom as strong as I. Death comes with the sadness of grief that always hits a human with loss. I feel no relief, I feel only the comfort of acknowledgement, that my path is set, that I believe this, however morbid, that life comes to death and that this, like everything, is inevitable. Everything, absolutely everything eventually comes to it, your happiness, your longevity, your well-being, all of these things will be ruined by it. Why not let things slip away when you are already so attuned to it?  Goddamn this world for bringing me so close to the pit, yet leaving me still so far away.

      Oops.   I THINK this is my address because I'm pulling it out of my memory right now. Josh can correct it later if need be. Sorry Will, my mom has the booklet with the address in it but you've been yelling at me for getting it out. Oh yea, last nite was extremely strange...why did you start it?  Rosie Jiang (duh!) Governor's School for the Sciences Hume Hall 1911 Andy Holt Ave. Knoxville, TN 37996  Again that's from my memory of writing it twice about 4 days ago...so. but I'm about 70% sure that, that's absolutely correct and 98% that 80% of that is correct. Yea I know, strange.  Just whatever you two do, Don't put UT knox or Chemistry department because that will slow the mail down to about 3 wks for it to wk through the university system. Love you all... though only 2 are ready now.

      Three more days until I'm off and I'm so BORED!!! Josh did you get my message? It's on your cell. Will- Sorry about my mom...that was amusing after the fact but she's just pissed now about anytime that I'm not studying for my SAT II's. If you need/want to talk to me then e-mail works really well. The pool party is definately going to have to wait since Zabeth went to Mississippi today, I'm leaving, and, well, Linds is busy. Josh is free though; so is Becky.  I know I'm a worry-bug but can the two of you do something for me in the next month, especially Will. Josh, I know you'll be kind of busy, at least mentally, with Linds and that's great, honestly. Becky is going through a really low period...yes I know euphenism (sp?)but she's told everyone that no one can help, esp Phil and I but I also know she adores her friends. Can you by any chance just keep her busy so she doesn't have that much time to dwell on the problems and spend time with the truly good part of her life, her friends? She loves movie nights and just hanging out. Go the Recreation World, go swimming, go ice skating (she does love that and she's good) just keep reminding her that her friends love her. I would if I was here but I also think that I wouldn't be able to do much even if I was. I love her to death and would give up Phil for her but in her mind the choice has been made and that choice distances Becky from me, at least alittle, for awhile. Also she loves running so if any of you feel up to the challenge go for it. I think she's doing a Red Cross Marathon so.. train with her or something. I love you two!!! Thanks!!! I know exclamation mark crazy but I don't know if I really put how strongly I feel about this in this little post (yes, LITTLE). I never thought I would stab a friend like I have, in fact I never thought I would have to face anything like it. You two have seen the brainstorming of if I do like him and if not and if I would ever act on it. You've heard me mull over how Becca has felt over the months and you have seen me deal with it. I also know that you two love me and have put up with alot because of me. Thank You. I know that isn't much but honestly thank you. I don't know what's going to happen as much as I wish I could say but I do know this, friends are the world. If it wasn't for you this past year, acedemics and all, would have been more insane than it was. Thanks for the little waves in the halls between English. Thanks for the walks from physics. Thanks for the "NOTHING!!" screams down the hall. Thanks for your know-it-all attitudes...both of you. Just plain...I'm gald your here. Take care of a friend for me. I know Josh by now is rolling his eyes and going "Rosie, you know I would without you asking" but I have to. I have to know that she'll be ok; not only that but happy. I want it so badly right now. Take care of her for me, for everyone. She's such an angel. No matter how much she says she's stubborn, strong, ok, fine, and going to be fine, she truly is more fragile than all that. Thanks. Forgive the mistypes and the bad grammar (spelling, punctuation, ect.) as usual. Oh yea...and don't forget to smile, sleep, and laugh.  Byebye

      Hey Josh...Jaoh...it's been awhile.  Anyway I wasn't going against my better judgment call me at nite...3646110... and it'll be ok but I usually don't get in until around 12...that's 11 for you so yea. Leave a msg though. Ask linds to call if she wants to talk. How's becca? Will is in CO right now and he's pissed and you guessed it..phil. Becca told him what phil said when he called her a spoiled brat and "can be repalced easily" and he's furious. So I think she's repressing something about what she really feels about what phil said that nite. I'm not happy with what he said but she should also know that she asked for the true and open feelings and he gave it to her. You would know if she's truly ok. I don't want another shocker from her or for her to get out of shock when I get back or... basically I want her happy. you know infront of me she's going to put on a face that says everything is alright. One of the things that phil did that nite beside yell at her was to make her feel guilty. If we didn't date because of her she would feel extra guilty because right now she thinks that what phil really wants is me...We'll discuss that later...that's a whole different argument for another day. Anyway she actually told me that she would hate me if I hurt him...yea right. Take care fo yourself for me k? You know I would have bubble wrapped you before I left if didn't know you wold have killed me...after you popped it all. Just take care, hug yourself for me everyday and hug linds for me too. Tell will that I'm not a blind twit when it comes to phil and that no matter what I love him too. Linds... just bubble wrap her with a peguino in it...then let her out after she has popped. Hug becca and tell her that Phil loves her daily...actually space it out because she doesn't like that name right now. Josh, you know how I feel about cheating and how much right now that Phil could hurt me. I also know that you know that becca wants to become closer to phil right now and not really with me. If anything happens btwn them two, lemme know. Don't worry I'm not going to run home and go on a completely rampage, honestly deep down I would be extremely hurt and grateful that the thing has ended. I just want a heads up so I don't come home and break down. I love you!!! take care. byebye

      Heya Rosie. Yar, sorry I didn't call, I didn't want to get you in trouble or whatever (like you had formally said), and I thought you might have been going against your better judgment on my suicidal behalf. So I'll try again later, perhaps, if you say to.  Linds is doing alright, by all accounts, and that is excellent. She'd been having seperation anxiety for a while there: feel like you don't belong back home, I had it plenty. I should really let her tell what she will, but that's the jist of it. Things are calming down, the problems are falling in the sights of our long-range "problem-solving" rifles. I'm going over there in a minute, so I'm going to stop talking.  Have fun at guv'na school. Will ain't dead insofaras I know, I'll check if I can, however that may be. Peace.

      Ok now that I've got more than like 30 sec to post, I'm glad that you called Josh...nice to know that you're alive and all. Is Linds out? I thought she got out today...Wednesday. How is she? One of the things I hate about being here is that I'm not there to see her when she does get out. Give her a hug for me...or alot of them. Are her parents still keen on not letting you two see each other? How does she feel? Tell me k? Have you heard from Will...has he jumped off a cliff yet? I haven't heard from him except to tell me to multiply by the page number when I didn't know an answer. Smile I'm still alive thought if you want to report to Phil that I'm dead, pregnant, anorexic, psychotic, in love with someone else...I don't care. But smile k? for me? yea I know not huge incentive but I still love you too. Anyway gtg. BYebye

      I'm here! I was taking a break because life was raping me, and the BLog was pissing me off. I'm silly and I'm EMO, and these two things, my friends, do not combine well. It's like oil and water that gets mixed and turns into bullshit, if that makes any sense.  Anyway, tonite I saw Ms. Reid, and 'twas fucking awesome (for lack of a stronger and better phrase. You can't get much better than "fucking awesome"; actually, you can't get better than "fucking awesome". So now I'm in a good, less EMO, more xHARDCOREx mood, and that's what I like. Sorry about the "Death Is Good" post. Well, not really, but if it makes you feel better Ms. Jiang, if you can buy that, please do.  I am about worn out. I just took 4 of my beautiful trileptols and I'm dying. It's time to hit the sack and stare for a few hours (too many naps today).  Peace.

      I really don't know how to respond considering there isn't really a response needed. Somehow GSS has made me understand what I do to my friends back at home. A couple of months ago Linds yelled at me to just sit down with Becca and Phil and end it. I tried but somehow I still wanted everything to be perfect. I love trying to reach perfection and since I'm so damn stubborn I'm oblivious to what that does to everyone around me. Josh and Linds, you two are amazing with each other and everyone around you so it's our turn, and mine especially to return what you have given me, love and kindness. Thank God for both of you because Linds is right, you did offer me everything but she's also right in that I need to work it out to a finality. By the time I get home everything will be worked out, that's a promise I make to you two. This college trial period has helped. I wish I could understand, truly, everything you two are going through but I can't and rather than annoy you with trying to find out I'm going to ask you to remember this  until we're ready to try to bridge the gap btwn the worlds:  I love you two more than anything in this world  and I would give anything up for you two.  That doesn't mean that I'm throwing phil out that door and you're right, if that is the biggest problem than screw me. I've made my decision and Josh, thanks for the resolution.

      If you haven't read all the posts until this one, I'd suggest you do. Stop groaning, just read, and with an open mind, all of you. I can't tell you where we're coming from, but I can say very poetically, yet truly, that we come from a place that reeks of decay and fright, a dead fear of something we can't give a name to.  Ah yes, normal. A term used by the failed experiment called psychology to encompass an average. Who defines normal? It's the same people that define what certain words mean. Who defines what "pen" means? Did you all read "Frindle"? If so, you'd know the answer. It was a person, the same creature that breaths, fucks, shits, eats, just like all the rest of us, no different, no more safe from dying, getting lucky, or anything than any of the rest of us. It's someone that still has a seizure threshold, has to pay taxes, keeps a circadian rhythm, all that good shit. Normal is over-rated and pointless.  No one can see inside like this, we may be outcasted to some extent...so what? We already talked about this before, yet still, this might be good for everyone else to hear: why bleed yourself over someone that's going to think they're better than you because you have a "problem"? The only difference between us and those people is that ours has a given name in a failed experiment/psychology book. Someone who says they don't have problems is a fucking liar. There's their problem right there: denial of problems. If you don't have them, you will. If you deny them, you're fucked. Life is all about accepting their occurance and taking them as they come, depressed as one could be or no.  I say down with the distinction, I say fuck psychology and their godawful classifications, I say separate the diagnosis branch from the treatment branch, because its current incarnation is causing all within it quite a bit of isolation, self-doubt. It's in some people's nature to doubt everyone else, this is only making it worse.  Yet still, they will not, no one's really listening to me, really. All I can tell you is my two favorite words in the whole world when it comes to things like this: FUCK IT. Fuck them, sorry you all, but fuck you. If you don't like me, blow me. If you can't deal with it and shut the fuck up about it, even if you were my best friend before, then suck on my goddamn goads because you are a complete fucking retard. And people, that's just the way it goes, that last sentence may have been a bit abrasive, but that's what everyone really needs to hear: the cold, hard truth of it, just like life really is. It might be better for some of us to hear it that way rather than me just pussy-footing around it with demure, blas language than to tell it to you with all the hatred and anger I can conjure from myself, and I did. You need to hear that I don't care who you are, I don't care how many of you have to go before I get it all straight: if you can't accept it, then you're the one that has problems, you're not helping me and I don't need you, and more over, you're not helping yourself.  I can see the day people like that wake up and figure out: "oh my god, what have I done?" That awful, awful day you come to realize that everyone is the same, everyone's fucked up as you are, nobody understands a motherfucking thing, everyone's drowning in something. Yeah, we all are. But the fun of life is taking that next big breath, and if we can respect everyone's right to take it, and respect the fact that no one really can have real dignity while they're drowning, then it's all right.  Life is about the right now, it's about coming to accept that there's a lot of shit here, and the only way to make yourself happy is to do just that: MAKE. No one was put here to give you anything. You can choose your miseries and your elations, even if you're messed up like we are. We can fight the feelings, we don't have to be one way or the other, we can just be ok. I don't have to be manic or depressed, I can just be in the middle. It's not all brain chemistry. If that were the case, we'd never fucking be alright, no one really understand the brain all that well.   Humanity is better than every other species becase we have a choice. Life is about taking that choice and making the most of it, respecting everyone else's choices, and choosing the things that will really make us happy, maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but sometime. And in the mean time, we can life with the happiness of knowing that we made the right decisions. Everything can really work out if you know what your options are.  The secret is just taking a step, whether you know where it leads, whether you can walk or not. MAKE your way, and you can take another great big breath. Hell, one day you may even reach the shore for good.

      Normal- I'm not sure if we'll ever get back to normal.  We've seen the bottom of the bottomless pit and have wallowed about in it for a while.  We've been scarred by it and marked as "different" because of it.  Sure, maybe one day we might be able to survive the climb upwards and perhaps get a foot on a ledge long enough for us to peek inside normal for a bit.  But actually breach the border of normal, the border so loved and protected by society against people like us?  No, maybe we'll be able see into normal, and perhaps be seen by normal, but never again will we be part of normal.  Once you're this far out of normal, you'll never be brought back in.  Isn't that what is so great about being normal?  Seeing that there are people who aren't like us, and knowing that they are better than us for it?  About half of the people who regularly come to this blog are normal, the other half obviously are not.  I give everybody one chance to guess who's in and who's out.  Every one of you will be able to give the right answer, and have given the right answer before, just like the rest of society will be able to do in the future.  You are still welcome in the circle of normal people- we have been excommunicated.  You have to realize that we will never again be able to see eye to eye.  There will always be that gap between us.  Those of us not in that lovely little circle have to protect ourselves from it.  There are so many of you and so few of us- we could never stand and fight you, but together we are at least able to protect ourselves against the the brunt of your blows, those that you don't even mean to hit us with, and yet you do, for no other reason than you are still inside the circle and can't quite understand those of us who are outside of it.  Hell, those of us outside can't even necessarily understand ourselves, let alone the others on the outside.  We can understand them better than we can those on the inside, because some part of ourselves can relate to them.  Very little inside of us can relate to you now.  Maybe more of us as time goes by, but not right now.  This is basically the same thing Josh said: "I'm too tired to really understand anything but depressed people."    Yall are so busy with your own little problems that you can't take the time to see the rest of the world struggling; your problems are no bigger, and frankly, quite a bit smaller than the rest of the world's.  Think about it: anyone who has the time to mull over the same miniscule problem for three freaking years, even when she's sitting on the solution that she's had the majority of the time because millions of people have given her the same advice, but she still doesn't take it because she's getting something out of having this problem, then YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS.  God gave you that gift for a reason, it's not one everyone has, so for Christ's sake, find someone who has way more than their share and help unburden them.  Or find yourself a decent problem.  I think the former would be the way to go on that one, but hey, it's your call.    Congrats, that was all my response to Josh's second paragraph.  On to the third and fourth:  I'm right in there with Josh on this one (except the part about his catching a lot of shit from me- I was/am the one throwing it at him).  We have been through hell, and aren't really all back yet.  I'm not quite sure if we'll ever be all back, but that's another rant all together (see above and change a few words around).  Point of that being, we have seen and experienced things that I wish to God no one else would ever have to experience.  Moreover, we are sitting right on the brink of going back- it really could go either way. I'm probably just speaking for myself now, but I know that the smallest thing could completely put me right back where I was.  Like last night, my mom said something about wanting me to do more around the house, and I completely broke down.  So to go back to Josh's post, quit with the melodrama already.  Everybody knows that's all it is anymore.  You have no more of my sympathy, you have no more advice, you have no more people to gripe to.  I have had it with this situation, and I know Josh has too.  You have a problem, yes.  But it's not ours to fix, and we're not going to.  We have given you more advice over the years than it should have ever taken to fix this problem.  You are getting something out of having this problem, and I no longer have any qualms about telling you what they are.  You get the attention that you want more than anything, you get the melodrama you seem to thrive on, you get the feeling that things are bad and it's up to you to fix them- it satisfies your need to feel important, and you have your need to be needed fulfilled.  That may be all great to you and everything, but you are more than burdening us with this.  If this was something that lasted less than a week, we'd probably be right there with you.  But it's not.  Part of this is our fault for enabling you to keep this thing going.  I assume you know what that is, otherwise I'll leave it for Josh to explain- I'm pretty sure he probably heard the same rants I did in the hospital.  Quite frankly we've enabled every single person we know just about it to manipulate us and to put us in the position to carry not only our own problems, which are pretty damned heavy, but yours also- which honestly, are pretty light, but they add up quickly.  You will only get rid of this problem when you want to, so nothing I say here will really change what's happening.  But you do need to know that you have the means to solve this problem today- it's possible- or it can rot you from the inside out, but no longer do you have us to lean on.  I refuse to further enable you to take advantage of everything I have ever offered you: empathy, a listening ear which would listen to you ramble for hours on end, a place you could always turn to no matter how messy things got, and most of all a real friendship.  I can't be any of this to you anymore until all this is solved- it's bringing me down too hard, too fast.  Maybe when the disadvantages of this problem outweigh all the things you are getting out of it, you will have the motivation to solve the problem.  What I am doing now is the exact opposite of enabling.  I refuse to be part of this dysfunctional support system any longer.  This is the point where I might used to apologize for what I was doing, but not now.  Enabling a person to continue doing something this stupid is a curse I wouldn't wish on my enemies, and certainly do not wish upon you. So when you have fixed this problem, I will be right here- nothing will have changed, but enabling you to put yourself, Josh, and me into a situation where you will keep going down the same road you're on now, and quite possibly trigger our problems to the point that we end up where we came from- that is just not something I am able nor willing to do right now.

      I think Linds is abso-fuckin'-loutely correct, so fuck it. Man, don't  even  delete that post. Let me tell you why this is so good to be said: it's true. The truth fucking blows a lot of times (remember me yesterday, blank stare and opposition to your every words about my dad, true as they were?) and it's hard to swallow, but that's about it.  IF PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOING TO JUDGE YOU OVER WHAT YOU SEE AS THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION, THEN  FUCK THEM  . Sorry guys, you really have to understand:  Whereas some of you have come to an edge and taken a peek over, we have jumped our asses over, landed hard, now we're trying to get back the hell up over and rejoin what the rest of the world would call "normal." Chaos would be a great word right now. That's all the hell it is. It's a big fucking vortex of uncertainty and self-doubt, fear of the outside world and the inside, all that good shit you hear from Faulker and Eliot (if you interpret it right).  So basically, we have the right to be assholes and tell everyone to just blow us. Let's not all forget, and again, sorry to be an asshole, but I  am  a suicide kid, a very swingy bipolar, and I'm not all the hell fixed yet. It wouldn't take all that much to bring me back to the old nightmare called the unit. Life has been pretty docile so far...yar, I caught a lot of shit with Linds, but I coped, I didn't come out broken down again. I don't know if I'll be that lucky again, and, being blatantly honest, I NEVER WANT TO GO BACK, NEVER THE FUCK EVER. I would rather eat my own right arm than go back, so long as I got some oregano and a nice baste. Hell, not even that, so long as I didn't have to go back.  All I'm asking is that you please don't send us back, in effect: acknowledging the hard but entirely factual truth of Lindsey's post.  We don't know anything about this anymore, I'll really tell you that taking a very objective look at the whole situation, the thing has be cojoned with so much fucking melodrama it's since ceased to float. That is a problem. That is not my problem.  I'm glad to hear that you've come to some resolution, Rosie. If it were me, let's just say, I would tell Phil to shut the hell up, his incessant bitching about the way shit should be isn't making anything better. Sorry bud, but that's the fucking way it is. Yelling at someone, being pissed, these things don't help. People NEVER positively respond to anger! You know this on some level as well as I. You'd only respond to it bad if you were codependent, and even then, you'd still secretly hate it.  It really doesn't matter who hurt who, it's fucking over. The horse is fucking dead, stop kicking him. He really doesn't feel it, I promise. If Philip does go off and fuck with someone else, guess what? Fuck 'em. Do you know why? Because if he did, he would be a worthless asshole (and Philip, if you read this, and if you act upon this, you are a fucking worthless asshole, and you know it, otherwise, you're fine). So in that case, utilize my two favorite words and move on.    Fuck him    And that's all. I really can't help Becca, she doesn't want to be helped yet, and truly, I don't want to try with someone that doesn't want it. I can't help you because there's nothing you need, and nothing I can give you. I can't batten down your qualms, and it really doesn't matter what I say, you know. It's just your ability to grasp the tangible and the real has ceased to exist, therefore, nothing I say will reek of valid like it usually does. And really, I couldn't anyway, because that would require me to understand, and really, I'm too MOTHERFUCKING TIRED to understand much besides depressed people (Linds, my mom and dad, most of the rest of my family), which makes sense cuz I've been there, and manic people, which is no one but me, and even then, I rarely understand it, I just endulge it. It's the only buttfucking time I want to move to any great extent. FUCK BIPOLAR, TIS BRINGING THE GAY. It's going to make me fat, and I'm going to be pissed.  so really, that's it. i'm tired of pressing shift, so i just quit capitalizing. har har. if it really matters, i'll go back and fix it later. but really, just fuck it all man. i hope you find it in yourself to really not worry about this, i can tell that you don't, no matter how much you try. a lie never helped anybody, especially one to yourself. go look up the "serenity prayer," you may already know it, but it would be really helpful if you don't, and if you do, you would do well to remember it.  Linds, aye. Lordy, I wouldn't wish trileptol, and effectively bipolar, on anybody, especially you. It really brings one to be learnedly helpless. You get good, then you get bad, and it never fucking ends. You figure out that whatever you do, you're going to come back down, and it sucks. It also helps to be up so damn late like this :) It's time to start.  I love you all, but some of you are making me pretty fucking batty :) (all of my heartfelt on that last sentence)  And Linds, remind me to delete this too. I probably should. I read yours and just nodded in agreement. I more laughed because I'm really getting a kick out of this whole "I'm going to eat your soul, mafucka!!" bitchy phase. It's about damn time! The more people you own, the better you feel, so let's have assholes for every meal. Yar, it's really late and I'm really tired. Peace.

      Ok, so I finally have enough energy to post a bit, but I'm not exactly in the best mood, but it's usually a trade-off, so whatever.  First off, I agree 100% with Josh on just about everything except the whole mania bit, cause I'm not lucky enough to get that. (Good job for all of you who actually picked up on that bit of sarcasm.) I'm tired of the whole Becca-Philip-Rosie situation too, and if I hear one more thing about it, I swear I will have a reason to go back to that hellhole they call a hospital.  Second thing, which Josh definitely already knows about: For the most part, the reason I went to the hospital is because I didn't feel emotion- God, I love intellectualization- but they broke my mask, so now I am a real bitch to just about everybody until I learn to actually control this stuff.  I either don't feel at all or feel way too passionately; it's pretty much an all-or-nothing situation.  I'm also completely self-centered and don't care about anybody but myself, with an exeption or two others thrown in occassionaly, so don't load me down with your problems yet. Wait until I can get my own problems dealt with first.  It may take a while.  Find someone else to dump the crap that no one will care about in 20 years on- but not Josh, he's got enough stuff to deal with between the two of us. (yes, Rosie, that DOES include you)Third, the reason I haven't actually talked to anybody but Abby and Josh yet is because I've got a freakin' social anxiety thing that won't go away, and quite frankly, Abby didn't make things too much better in that department.  Remind me to thank her later.  I did finally make it to a restaurant today, which was a miracle, but all the same... Anyway, congratulations to anyone who had time to read this before I remember that I wrote this post and delete it.  Then again, my memory is not so hot these days.  These drugs have me fucked up [refer to Josh's post here] to an extreme.  Welbutrin is making me insane, Trazadone is about to kill me, and I get a new one called Effexor here in the next week or so.  I'm jealous of the Trileptol- that is one amazing drug.  Everybody but me got it- I almost did, but stupid Indukuri decided that it may not be the best thing for me, so I get Effexor, which is basically the same drug with worse side effects.  Look them up sometime, they're really fun.  Ok, now I'm rambling and the Trazadone has kicked in so these last few sentences have probably not been so coherent, but I don't really care.  I'm going to bed.  Oh, and Rosie, why are you showing people the blogs?  Josh, if I haven't deleted this by tomorrow morning or so, you may want to do that before I really offend people. Of course, you'll get a big laugh out of it first.  Oh well.  Good night.

      Josh, bro, call me. I love you and please please please know that with all your heart. I know what you've been saying about Phil is true. I have a guy here that just read that post (parts of it) and he said the exact same thing to me 2 days ago. I have to figure this out by myself. I have to know for sure that he's what I need and want in my life. I figured out here that I really don't need Phil to survive. I've found my circle of friends here and I'm comfortable. Yes I call him but the past 2 days I haven't thought of him...which is strange for me. I have to decide Josh but for right now I'm going to enjoy Knoxville. I love the people here and I love the environment. I'm not going to worry about what happens in B-wood for 3 more wks. I love you all but for me it's knoxville now. You've all told me to live...well I am. I'm going to stay connected to you but for a month Phil and I will seriously keep in on the DL. We've decided no matter what we'll stay friends and above everything else is friendship...number one forever. That's how it is now. Thanks for loving me but you know most of all I call the last one. I know I don't have a huge choice but I choose time. I choose GSS for the month. Love you.

      Let me tell you a little story about a man called Stability.  Well, not really. But the key word here is "stability." Embrace constancy, it's the nepethe for the human condition. Think about your body: it wants homeostasis, a point of norm. If you keep messing with your environment and deciding to change too much (or thinking you can, which is worse), no matter how good the control feels right now, if it's real or not, you're going to wear yourself out.  And moreover (and more importantly; no offense, but I  am  a suicide kid), it's wearing  me  out. Honestly, pick a path and stick to it. Remember what happened to the kid who wandered too far off the path because he thought he could come back without any problems: messily devoured by wolves and then peed on. I don't think, dead or alive, I would much like to have something urinating on me, would you?  This really has gone on long enough, all of you. You win, stop the guilt. It's either him or her, it's not both. Sometimes we get denied an option because not everyone thinks alike. That is NOT within the scope of your control. If Becca is going to be depressed and guilt's flying all over the place, I'm sorry. But that's nothing you can feasibly control. This may sound like an asshole thing to say, but think about it: even if you say, "Fuck off Philip, you gay!" it's still not going to make him like Becca, and you're not going to have him either. What more, she's going to think you broke up with him out of pity for her, and she's STILL not going to like you (and if Becca's reading this, aren't I right?!) because she's going to see it. Something has to get lost, it's called acceptable casualties. I wish just as much as you do that the world was colored pebbles and bunnies and lilies singing in the field, but since it isn't, we have to make the best out of a shit situation and forget about the rest. Things don't come back to haunt you if you don't let them.  It's our fear of the past that creates the problems of the future.  WRITE THAT DOWN ON YOUR LIFE. I think I'm even going to post that on all of the blogs and my Xanga for the hell of it. That was damned insightful, and true, what more.  But really, make a decision and stick to it. The more you doubt yourself, the more indecision you have, the more nothing gets done, the more you just hurt the situation til you don't have a choice anymore like you do now, get me? I really hope you read all this, really.  IF YOU JUST SCROLLED THROUGH, ROSIE:  READ ALL OF THIS RIGHT NOW, TIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. AFTER THIS PART, YOU CAN QUIT.   Alright, on to me :) I'm fucked up on trileptol. This shit is killing me. I'm a fucking walking zombie with some hot looking Chucks on. I swear, my head hasn't spun this much since the last time I stuck my head in a dryer...which has been...oh, let's see...never, right. I seriously want to blow up. I hate fucking being a bipolar, it sucks a fucking nut. I'm really really super-fucking manic about now. It makes me ultra-insightful and fun, but I really fucking hate it. I say fuck a lot, people tend to like me less sometimes when they say something that could be taken the slightest bit offensively. I seriously can't type "seriously," or anything on the first try, for that matter. And the worst part of it is: I'm out the fuck of fucking options. I have ONE LEFT: lithium carbonate, and that requires me to go stay in the FUCKING UNIT  AGAIN ! Fuck me! Like hell they'll take me back! AAAAGGH! I'm going to explode. I haven't had a moodswing like this since Linds...actually, this is worse than that. I really feel like my heart is about to start pumping so hard it's going to come out of my mouth, but that I'll enjoy it when it happens. I know, all of this sounds weird, none of you will understand what the fuck is going on, but that's alright. I would actually prefer if you didn't say anything about it. I can't explain it right now that you could.  It's just a whole hell of a lot of crazy energy waiting to come out. My heart is a caffeine factory and my brain is an amphetamined, angel dusted foreman. I'm the bipolar I king of the whole fucking universe. Yes, I typed bipolar  ONE . Something crazy is happening right now. I keep thinking about Picasso, the way he cut off his ear during mania. I think I could do it, but I wouldn't. Actually, I've learned enough to not be so crazy as to act on any of my shit ideas I get when I'm manic, but I really think some crazy shit sometimes when it's happening. It's all here. Don't expect any of the things I say here to happen, I'm smarter than that (and no smart-ass comments to that, or I'll eat you).   It sucks because I know that very very soon, I'm going to come down and bomb the fuck out, I'm probably going to get so depressed I won't know what to do with myself except sleep and think about nothing. That's what I do these days when I'm depressed: concentrate on abso-fucking-loutely nothing. It helps. It doesn't tangle my depressed stuff with my good stuff, it's not worth it trying to cheer myself up during depression, it's not that simple, and it doesn't work, so fuck it. I plan to keep my good memories in tact for mania and baseline so that there there in whole form and ready to be used as they should be, not as death-traps waiting to bring me down (although sometimes, as in now, they could be useful).  I think I just felt myself beginning to drop. You can't run a car forever without it stalling out and coming to a complete stop. I puff the last of my psychic gasoline and come to a screeching hault wrapped around a telephone poll but quite alive, just bleeding. Every time. What a feeling it is. That's the best description I could give, the best yet. I give on this post. It made me feel better, it filled the last half-hour quite well. If you actually read all this, I'm having your children, come to Unca Josh's right now. Peace out, y'all mega wonderous pals o' mine.

      Well, ok. If you really want to complicate things like that, geez. I believe that smartness  is , in fact, a word. And if it isn't, now it is, officially certified by me, at least on this BLog, and here, I have the absolute authority as such. So hereby,  smartness is now an official word and shall be used as much as possible. thank you for your time, please go and enjoy the smartness of the rest of your day   Heh. I'm a retard. I'm also caffeinated, and tired, and hungry, which would make me a caffetirehungretard. That's a word now, too, but nobody has to use it. I just sort of made it up because I was being retarded. And I really am trying to live up to my word potential.  Oh man, I just got struck with some EMO, I really wanted someone here a second ago. Mmh. Let me tell you about this person.  Did you ever know anyone that just defined the better parts of you by being themselves? I know someone like that. This person is like the best thing you've ever tasted and you can't get enough of...maybe a more abstract example, but it's like having a really bad itch, then scratching it: there's some really massive relief after the fact, this person is like that relief. A feeling of comfort, a constant source of joy and appreciation, a friend without limits to the bitter end and beyond, in the way that you'd really like to tell people about but you just can't describe, someone who you'd call on for anything because they'd call on you for all the same reasons. Someone who knows how you bleed and shares in it somehow everytime you do, not just sitting there and telling you to let it slide, that life's tough, whatever. It's a person that could say all the same right things anyone else could say, and yet, the way this person says them, they're just that much better. It's a person you would be happy to stand up and defend if all the world would fall on you if you did, the kind you would take a bullet for, an army's load of bullets if it came down to it, it's someone that would and has held my hand through everything that's happened for years now, that gave me a reason and a want to understand, that made me believe that I am something to someone, that still inspires me to remember the beautiful things in life, to remember that there is still love even when the world seems filled with black, that can pull me from the clutches of my very own ever-fucking prison if only for a while and remind me that they're still here, they're standing at the bars just outside, waiting when I'm ready to come out again. This person is life, this person is one I would lay down my very waking life for if only for five minutes with them.   I think the person whom (gram?) this is for will know it. I really thought of you a second ago, and you really just inspired me to type this down...I wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you, and I thank you for everything that you mean, and everything that you've done and will do. My heart will always save the greatest place for you.

      Yes, please leave the child-bearing to me.  I think I might be able to handle it a bit better.  Probably not well, but better.    Don't worry about the car- it would have only been worth guilting over if you had hit it, and even then, not really.  A car is not some unfixable thing, that's why God made mechanics.  I know I wouldn't want to live forever unless there were somebody from the "early years" (that I actually liked) that was there to live it out with me.  Even then, it would be hard- seeing everyone you love die can't be too much fun.  And try explaining it to people, that would be interesting.  Heh, love the irony in this.  A month ago I wasn't sure I wanted to live until the next day and now I'm thinking about living forever. Oh well.  Jane's a smart person, so everyone should listen to her. She kicked me out of therapy, thought, but I guess that just proves her smartness.  I don't think that's a word.  Yeah, I'm currently attempting to apply to colleges, so my brain is very much fried.

      Ok kids. So if you could live indefinitely, with the only harm to your longevity coming from external influences (i.e.: getting run down by a rhino herd, per se), would you do it? And if so, for what reasons? Sean Landis posed this question in his Xanga, and I decided to answer it. I really don't know if I would.  On one hand: you do get to watch the progress of human history, which is very cool in itself. You can actually find out if you were right about what's going to send the world to hell. You get to indulge all the new technology, hell, probably see space farther than our generation will ever know (most likely, and Steven Hawking is a douche, all of you that believe him are pseudo-intellectual pussies, and I bet half of you don't know what the bloody fuck he's talking about in the first place. Don't spout off his rhetoric, give me some of your own fucking proof, assholes...just had to get that out), basically, you get to live the stuff we can only dream about now. That would be super-awesome.  But then the bad. Well, first of all, I would have to live with being a bipolar for the rest of eternity, which is always fucking awful in general. Of course, that doesn't apply to everyone, so yar. But secondly, I would leave behind all of my friends, family, those that I love. I don't think I could really handle it...I don't think the rest of you could, either, could you? If you say yes, you have no soul, what the hell are you doing on this BLog you homewrecker? And if you say no, haha, you codependent, totally non-self-reliant, tagalong. I AM JUST KIDDING! Really. I'm seriously codependent, so there. Like, really. Sometimes it hurts. I guess that's what codependency is all about. But whatever.  Hmm...so the answer in my case would have to be no. Fuck living forever, that would suck. And if I had to, I would just go ahead and rope myself, since that  would  work, per this example. Egh.  HEY ROSIE! My therapist said something the other day that was quite interesting. She said: "If they're (the Phil triad, in this case) still fighting after this long a time, they're just doing it because they like it." Would you consider this to be valid? I would, actually. But, eh, it's not my big issue, and you have your own brain. We're (me, Linds, Becca, Philip) going out to eat tomorrow night. I haven't talked to any of ye'all in quite a while, so I'll see through them how everything is going, I guess.  It's tea time biotch! Actually no, that was five minutes ago. I finished it long before this post. Eh, I give. I'm tired, this is ridiculous. If you actually read all this, be sure to tell me to have your children, I'm serious. This is a real feat.  Actually, Linds is the only one that actually reads all of this, so Linds: I'm having your children. Man, what a braintrip to read in the middle of a post. Well, the end of a post. Man, I'm getting sick of typing. But I thought I would just type this much because, eh: I can. Anyway Linds, anytime you're ready, you can just infuse me with your children. It'll suck and all for a while, I don't know if guys are equipped to circumvent morning sickness very well, or labor pains. Hell, we can't even do breathing exercises very great. I think that's normally why our jobs are so limited. By the way, I'm sorry I got so close to your car last night when we pulled in. Yeah, I know it wasn't a big deal, and here I am guilting about it. I seriously need some help.  Speaking of, I'm fucking done.   the end

      Woohoo! Happy July Fools' Day! Perhaps a more coherent post later, I'm watching cool movies right about now.   I just found this button next to the Hyperlink one, so I'm testing it out. I guess we'll see what it does in a second, eh? Alright, then. You all have a good'un!

      Heh, I'm glad you enjoyed yee Wonderfule Englishe (the two "e"s on "ye" are intentional: everything has an added "e"). I really didn't mean to type "behaviour" like I did, it just sort of came out and I kept it. I think I'll do that with all the cool words as such. Like...um. "Saviour" and "behaviour" and um...well. Fucke mee, Ie don'te knowe anye moree. At least at the moment. I'm sort'o'tee-red (read: tired). I just ate din-din. This is the first time I actually got to the computer in the last three or so days! YES! Or two, I'm not very sure. I don't think it really matters.   Sir William, I hope you're doing ok. It really sucks about your aunt. I wish I could do more for you, but 1) I really wouldn't know what to do, 2) you might not need it, and 3) I'm still a suicide kid. I probably shouldn't be cutting back on sociality this much (i.e.: just Linds :) but it's all good, thou'rt good company Miss Lindsey of Reid) but eh. I should really do what I feel like for a while. Hmm. That sounds really assholeish. I don't know, it's sort of against my nature to not want to help everyone. I guess it's a problem in itself. Well, that's not entirely true. Nobody really ever weighted me down with everything they got hit with. At least, consciously it didn't. What am I saying?! It's madness! I think it's time to go to bed. Har har.  Peace, my rockers.

      I most definitely agree on both points.  1) Rosie, quit apologizing and do something about it.  Apologies are no longer needed, and in fact are getting you absolutely nowhere.  Surprisingly enough, this isn't directed toward anyone.  In fact, this is just kind of a rant.  However, I do highly suggest that people read this.  It's kind of a continuation/elaboration on Josh's post.  2) The unit SUCKS.  If you go there without a reason to be in there, you'll come out with one.  I think it'd be really funny to see any one of yall try to get into that unit- CRISIS would laugh their asses off.  Trust me, yall are nowhere near depressed, I promise- and you really shouldn't want to be.  I wouldn't wish all this on my worst enemy.  It's pain like yall will never have to go through- it's not something to take lightly.  I laugh every time one of you goes "I'm so depressed today," as if you know the meaning of the word.  You really don't, and fortunately for you, you probably never will.  At least I hope you won't.    But seriously, yall- come on.  The unit is no picnic- you've never been any place like it and never want to be.  This isn't some stunt for attention or whatever, and should never be used as one.  This is real- I don't think some of you get that- this is REAL.  These are our LIVES we are talking about here.  This isn't something that is going to go away. We can't just snaap our fingers and make it better- the hospital does not by any means, fix things.  We didn't just wake up one morning and say, "hey, I think I'll be depressed and go to the hospital to get it fixed."  It just doesn't work like that.  This isn't some broken bone that the doctors can just magically heal.  This is something that we might actually not get over.  I hope to God that we will because I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.  Point is, there is no guarantee that everything is going to be all hunky dory.  This is something that takes work- it's harder than anything I've ever had to do in my entire life.  We didn't come out of the hospital with all of our problems fixed, as some of you seem to think.  We're not "back to normal."  This is one of those things that changes your life, for better or for worse, but it has happened and we have to deal with that.  I'm not saying yall don't have problems- you do- but their not things that make you "depressed".  Just because you are sad or disappointed for a couple of days does not make you depressed.  Depression is something we will never be able to explain to you because you haven't been there.    I'm sorry if that makes you feel left out or on the outside or whatever.  We're the ones on the outside here, and I promise you don't want to and probably can't join us.  We appreciate your friendship and support, but we can't make you a big part of this, even if we wanted to.  There are some things that truly are beyond comprehension.  I really think this is the problem here- all of a sudden, we're in a whole different world from yall, and it's impossible for yall to join us here, try as you might.  You can't make yourself depressed, and even if you could, I wouldn't suggest it.  Even if we were to miraculously get better right now, we still wouldn't be able to rejoin your world, if for no other reason than we have experienced the other world.  Really, I am sorry that we've left yall in this position, but it's not something we would have ever chosen for ourselves.  But it has been chosen for us.  Unfortunately, we can no longer lean on yall as much as we used to, by choice or not, so we're having to make up for it by leaning on each other.  Yall are still our best friends, but you just have to understand- you can't always be there.  And Josh, I loved the British spelling.  Nice touch.

      I don't really know if you quite got it or not. We're really not looking for a lot of excuses for past behaviours, it sort of makes one look...dumb. Sort of putting on a face when it occurred to you to do it. Perhaps there's not a better time than the present, but had it happened before all this shit, we might have appreciated it better. All the same, it's alright.  What we're really looking for is your having no more reasons to need to apologize, I guess. Then again, it's about 1230 in the morning, and I'll have to go back and re-re-read your post.   Anyway, guys. A really quick word on summat. I don't, again, want to come off looking like a fuck for saying it, but if you really look at this, it's pretty sad. Case in point: DO  NOT  EVER   USE THE UNIT AS A LITTLE GARNER FOR YOUR OWN ATTENTION. The unit is for people that really need it, and chances are, most of you are not. Yes, something like this did happen already, I'm just telling you all in advance. You may think you're having a bad day and it's a really bright idea to check yourself in at Vandy, but I'll tell you, 1) it's not, and 2) it's just fucking NOT, man. I can tell you, you'll really regret it. Having talked to all of you at length, I can't really judge you as "clinically depressed" even on your worst days. So please, don't use this to draw attention to yourself when you feel lacking of it.  This post was NOT directed at anyone specifically on here, so don't be offended :) it's just a warning. I hate the unit, but by god if people are going to use it to be selfish sons'a'bitches.

      Wow, what some posts we have on here people, goodness.  Ok, so I'm leaving at around 8:30 in the morning for the Spirit Song Music Festival.  My mom's driving me 5 hours to Cincinnati.  I'll be home sunday around 1:00ish.  Sorry if you miss my pretty posts around here for the next three days, but I promise (or is it a threat?), I will be back.  And I want to see some major postage on this blog by more than just Josh, cause he'll get lonely since no one gives decent replies around here anymore (I do understand the rushed post, though, will.  We all do it sometimes.)   Anyway, so I'll miss yall, or those I see and/or talk to regularly, I guess is more acurate.  But even those I don't, I will be thinking about you.  By the way, Rosie, where do we get in contact with you via phone?  I'm not so good about e-mailing right now.    Ok, so I took a Trazadone and have more energy now than I did at 3:00 this afternoon.  That's kind of sad.  So I should probably go now.  I've got to pack dvds and such for the LONG trip tomorrow.  Call me and keep me sane, please!!!    I'll see you/post sunday.

      you might notice that her post on the blog is almost two and a half times longer than her post here, but at least she made some sense.  I've never seen Mr. Holland's Opus nor Interview with a Vampire, nor have I ordered something online.  I'm such a party pooper  and this is officially a rushed post, sorry.

      Eh~it's as good a topic as any, it must have been a very rewarding experience (in fact, I know it was). I won't be surprised if I hear in a few months that Mr. Holland's Opus became worn to the point of unuseable due to overuse a couple of months from now :) but that's the way these things go. The first thing I ordered for myself was a CD, long since broken...I don't even remember which one it was. But man, I felt like a million bucks, even if it was only $14.95 or something. Bitter irony.  Linds has it man (awesome job Linds). See, it's not that her post had any relevence...do any of them? Was there ever a specific topic line herein? NO. The point of the BLog is to post. It's like voting: you may not know shit about any of the candidates, but hell, you can say you voted by getting out there and pressing a couple of buttons! Well alright...that was sort of a bad analogy. But again, it's the principle of the thing. Just stir up a random topic, and voila.  I just watched  Interview With The Vampire . Man, what a great movie. There's you a random topic, in case anyone cares to talk about it.  Um...really, I can't think of anything. I could say a bunch about Interview but I don't think anyone would really care. Not too many people this day in age have actually seen it. I will say, though, it's a totally different movie now versus when I was 10 or whatnot. I understood the concepts in the movie the first time, but only on that purely rational level, this time I had that good understanding of why somethings were sad. Like, the first time, I was like, "Die Kirsten Dunst! You bitch!" but this time I actually found out that this might not be such a good thing, even if she was a demanding little whore in that movie, and she made me want to punch somebody 90 percent of the time (she didn't this time, strangely). Ok, fuck this. It's boring.  I don't have much time right now, but I'm going to think of a great post and get back on here later. A topic, even. A topic that everyone will care about, even if it sparks lively controversy and makes us all hate each other. Actually, if that's the case, I probably am against it to, but again, it's the principle of the thing. Bah. I'm rushing this post too much. These things suck if you don't take your time with them. You can approach them without a point, sure, that's alright, and you can be bored and skip all over the place, it's still ok. But man, if you rush a post, it doesn't make shit for sense.  The end. (good one on the posting, Linds...we should probably meet these people we know someday, they sound to be pretty cool :) )

      Well, since absolutely no one has posted on here in almost a week, I guess I'll do the honors. It's not like I actually have anything to say, it's just that the silence needs to be broken. Anyway, so let's see here. What can I talk about?   Hmmm...   Let's see...   Well, crap. Josh, you already know everything, and I don't really care if anyone else knows stuff. But I'll see what I can get out here.   Oh, I ordered something online the other day for the first time ever.  And then it came yesterday, and it was really exciting.  Ok, so I bought a Mr. Holland's Opus DVD, so I guess it's not something to be really excited about, but I love the movie, (I watched it twice yesterday) and the package had my name on it, so I was happy.    And... well, I don't know- I broke the ice, didn't I?  Someone else come up with something to say!  I'm boring yall with details of an online order, so somebody say something more interesting than that.  I promise it won't be too hard.    And Josh, I do know someone just like that.

       Oh PIMP!! This is so great! Now we can change colours and everything. And here I was about to make a depressing post and this cheered me up just a bit. So I guess for a minute here I'll be going on about how&nbsp;great this is...and it is. Ok, done. Let's change back to black and have done with it, then.    &nbsp;  Alright. So after having a day that pretty much was a mania, I find it no surprise that I've come to hit rock bottom. But I guess all the wonderful training has paid off. I guess...rather than letting it eat me up, I can just feel it, instead. But man, is it god-awful. I feel at times like this that something is about to kill my brain. Not me, just my brain. It's as if there's something very real to be feared right here that will definitely torture and kill my living thoughts. I have come to know what it is through the last couple of months, and this is why I am able to deal with it.  &nbsp; I guess I'll make a long post short. Right now, I'm thinking about my grandparents. Today, for the first time, I heard about my grandmother's first husband, Carl. He was a paranoid schizophrenic if ever there was one. Anyway, my grandmother can tell a story, and she doesn't even have to DO much. But all the same, she did, and it scared the living hell out of me. She told me the way it came to pass, how he began to fear everyone and everything, how he forgot what, who, where, and how he was, everything along those lines. I had never known any of this. &nbsp; Anyway, I guess&nbsp; the thing that kills me most is that she and Carl were helpless romantics when they met. That story has stuck with me, and every time I've thought about it since, I can't help but see me in that position, completely lost my mind, destroying everything I once knew and loved. I know it's EMO poetic, but I can see myself. Schizophrenia scares me enough as is, just thinking about the nature of it, but even worse: to see myself in it. And it doesn't help to be thinking  This is Not The X-Ray Room  by Clearing Autumn Skies over and over again: that song sounds like schizo, yeall need to hear it to know what&nbsp;I mean. Augh. It's killing me, and yet, it's not. It's really complicated. Anyway, it's not the "o god put me away" sort of depressed...mayhaps something IS getting better?!? Stay tuned to find out. &nbsp; Peace.

      You're in luck.&nbsp; There is no way possible that that is true.&nbsp; First, if you look at the picture, they have "implanted" the embryo in his stomach.&nbsp; The "live" sonogram and vital signs keep repeating themselves.&nbsp; And just logically, what hospital in its right mind would approve a study like this? Especially done&nbsp;on a human before trying it multiple times on an animal?&nbsp; The thing in Time is fake- there is someplace that you can put your own face on the cover of Time, just like you can on the Wheaties box.&nbsp;And the other link talks about sea horses, not about human male pregnancy.&nbsp; Sorry to bust your bubble, but this one isn't real.

      Please tell me this isn't real. And if it is, just tell me it isn't anyway. Actually, yes, do tell me, my bullshit detector is going off on this one considering some of their other "experiements," like a mouse with human intelligence, which is just a bunch of flash and smart macros, or a genetics detector you can do ONLINE, just put your thumb to the screen (?). Or how about nanotechnology...o wait, that won't be coming out for the next three hundred years or so.  &nbsp;  But this last one actually got press. I don't think the vital signs are real, nor is the sonogram, but it in itself might not be real. It says he'll be having the baby in private, so I don't believe it. And yes, you just read "HE'LL be HAVING THE BABY." This is fucking rich.  &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.malepregnancy.com    Now watch me look like an ass because I missed the one little line on there that said "PSYCH! Morons, joke's on you." But in my defense, I STILL can't see how this could be real.

      No one ever posts on this blog either.  This sucks.  Maybe when we get back in school people will start posting again.  But I don't want school to start.  It's too soon- I'm not ready for it to start yet.  Ok, so technically I will never be ready, but I'm especially not ready right now.  And I need to get a job but I don't want to do it.  I just want to sit around all the time and be a lazy bum of a teenager.  This is the first summer I've ever actually done it, and I definitely enjoyed it way too much.  I don't want to quit.  But we have 9 days until school starts and I have all the new clothes and everything I need, now I just need the will power to make myself actually go to school.  It doesn't quite look like it's coming.  This year is going to suck and we all know it.  We shouldn't be here- we should be in college now.  We have to take a whole year of school to complete the 3 credits we actually need to fulfull to graduate.  This frustrates me to no end.  I want out- I'm sick of this.   Oh well, I'm going to quit complaining now.  It's not actually getting me anywhere besides depressed so I'm shutting up.

       Well, I guess that just proves that we have a new reason to go out to breakfast.  Except that the only IHOP I know of is on Nolensville Road, which is quite a ways away.  It is really good though.  I quite enjoy it.  I hope everything went okay today and that you aren't too incurably crazy.  I suppose I'll probably be at the concert when you get this.  *sigh*  I almost don't want to go- I'm insanely tired.  I'm going to go take a nap in here a second.  Oh well, it'll be fun, I guess.  I'll call you when I get home.  It probably won't be any later than 11:00 or so.  We're not staying through all of Dave Matthews.  Oh, and hi to everybody else, because that was pretty much directed at Josh. Didn't want yall to feel left out.or anything.

      I agree on this point, but I haven't been to IHOP enough to really consider them one way or another. Mostly I go there and get burgers...heh. Again, defeating the purpose of the place. But hey, their specialty is "freedom" toast anyway, so I guess it's fine to eat something else, just like Waffle House is famous for hashbrowns, yet, is tenatively titled...WAFFLE...House. It beats the hell out of me.  T'was good seeing you today Ms. Reid, and I'll talk to you tomorrow (or today, depending on when you read this).

      Waffle House is wonderful, grease or no. Second only to IHOP, I do believe.  Besides, their hashbrowns are officially the best breakfast food ever invented.

      Hey all,  Sorry Linds, I've been reading the posts but responding... well it didn't seem like I needed to.  Anyway, I'm kinda excited about school. I'm about to face a challenge that I don't know if I can do, I hope I can. Emotionally, I think this year will be alot more stable than it has been in the past. I guess I have alot to be hopeful for. The only part of next year I'm not happy about is that I actually have to write stupid essays that will get me accepted or rejected from a college along with the academics and then Blair. Not to mention I hope I'll get into my student worship team. *crosses fingers* Just smile. I've kinda learned that a big part of our feelings is up to our mind. I know I'm in a slightly different boat but think of this year as FUN!!! It's our last good bye party ... that kinda lasts a year.  Speaking of party... Will when is that pool party. I have a suggestion. Next week is kinda in the air for me but I have a feeling that I'll be doing more college application essays. What if we did the party on Monday, the 16th... like after school? Would that work for everyone? Who would "everyone" at the party be? Is that going to work for everyone else in here since we're the "core" group? Opinions?  Will, I know. Linds said the exact same thing. I know you all have reservations with him but again, it's my choice. I have my reasons though they might not make sense to you. The main part is that I realized that I really don't need him to be happy. He just kinda tags along to make me laugh and vice versa. It's something that feels "right" for both of us.

      My dad was in the hospital because he had a HUGE fever plus the rash plus the fact that his throat was so sore he couldn't eat or drink or SWALLOW.  He had to be put on MORPHINE in order to swallow.  Period and sign.  It wasn't fun.  And I wouldn't wish that on ANYONE.  Ever.  I'll call you in a sec.  ~Z

      Josh- you just made my day!  The Old English always puts a smile on my face.  I love you guys.  I never thought I'd say this, but I REALLY want to come back to school now.  But noooooo, I have to be home schooled for a few weeks, then come back for only like, two periods at a time (I'll try to make it 5th as often as possible) AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I'm going to scream if I don't get out of this house soon.  Even the visit to the doctor today was a treat, and I'm not fond of doctors.  GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I hate being sick, and I found out today that it's going to be, not days, but WEEKS until I get out of here.  SAVE ME!!!!  People, get your butts over here and visit me!!!!!!  I'm not contagious!!!  I'm seriously begging you to GET ME OUT OF THIS TORTURE CHAMBER!!!!!!!!!  Wow, I feel better now.  I'll try not to do that again for a while.  I'm starting to count down the days until I'm back at school.  It's not looking good for now.  Instead of getting better, I'm getting worse.  This sucks MAJOR BUTT!!!!  Also, I could end up in the freaking HOSPITAL!!!  How much would that suck?  Oh, and Z, exactly, WHY was your dad put in the hospital?  It wasn't just the rash, was it, cuz I've got it now.  Luckily, I don't have much of a fever.  Only like the equivalent to about 100 degrees or so (for those of you who don't know, my body temp is like, 4 or 5 degrees below the normal temp.  Don't quite know why, though)  So, people, help put me out of my misery.  I don't know how, just HELP!!!!!!!  I HATE THIS WITH A PASSION!!!!!!  I'll talk to yall tomorrow.  I'm hitting the sack.

      Rosie-no one is happy with him.  Stay away from him.  I mean it.  Oh well.  I'm home again.  This is getting annoying.  I won't be back for at least a week or so.  Mono is not pretty.  I'm not quite sure how active I'm going to be on the blog, but stay tuned.  I will be back eventually.  I'm bored.  Call me at lunch on school days to cheer me up.  I just hope I don't land in the hospital...the doctor said it was a very real possibility.  Oh, I'm going to be in a home bound program for a while.  Even when I come back it's only going to be partial days.  I gotta go.  Even playing my piano wears me out, so I'm gonna go sleep for a couple of hours.  See you guys later, I hope.  Oh, and I can't go on Sonshine Retreat this weekend.  I'm NOT a happy person.

      Z, I don't care what you do outside my blog.  Wait, yes I do...But that's not the point.  The point is that I must initiate the "no-conflict-for-the-mostpart" rule, meaning don't rip throats out but you can politely nudge toward conflict.  Thanks for coming on board.

      Salve, amicas and amici.  I have officially landed.  ;)    I will keep you from talking to him, like I said I would.  You can count on me.    Anyway, is there a "no conflict" rule on this Blog like on Josh's because I want to know in advance if I can rip throats out verbally or if I will have to do it physically.  Just in case I have to and there is no other recourse for my oh-so-fragile sanity.  I think I might have my first one in mind.    Anyhow, gotta go and I will talk to you people later.  ~Z

      For the record...I do not want contact with Ryan and it is yall's job to protect me from making contact with him, whether it's by keeping him from seeing me or saving me from myself.  Rosie...You don't want to know him...If you think your mom hates Gunther...nevermind...Jackie & Bryan- You're wedding is already on my calandar.  I wouldn't miss it for the world. I'm so excited!!!  But Bryan, you better take care of her!  Z and Becca, hurry up and get on this thing.  Josh, I'm sorry about Leigh.  I'm not saying anything else about that though.  And I know all of you guys don't know each other, but at least you're not rivals like on Josh's blog.  Maybe if I can get Josh, Rosie, etc. to church or Jackie to visit BHS, it'll work out.  Speaking of, Jackie, you're out of school now, you better come visit me, girl.  Oh, and for all the guys out there, if you call, be ready to give me your middle name.  Ryan keeps trying to call like he did about an hour ago pretending to be Josh (sorry, Josh, not quite sure how he knows I know you) and so I've been kinda filtering the calls.  God, I want life to go back to how it was like three weeks ago.  Life without Ryan is SOOOO much better than trying to avoid all his shit.  Yall have to remind me of that.  And let's try to keep his name off this blog as much as possible (though I'll probably be the one to break that one) We'll deal with my other problems, and trust me, there are enough of them.  Love you guys.  Thanks for listening to me.  I should be at school tomorrow if I can convince my mom I'm better.  I really don't feel better, but I HATE make-up work with a passion.  See yall later.

      Yay!  Josh and I are all better I think.  But I don't think I'm helping him so I'm staying out of his life for a while;  I'll just be the spectator for this event, while Leigh is the opponentish type person maybe, but could possibly sometimes be on his team and while Rosie tries to be the referee.  Josh, the real you, no matter how bad, is better than a fake you.  Sometimes you just have to censor and discipline you real self a bit so it's socially acceptable.  I have to do that quite frequently, and I'm still not always socially acceptable.

      I'm not really as mad as I am upset.  I see my last year's self in Josh and it is like a terrible rerun.  And it hurts me so bad.  I have been through all this and it's hell, pure hell.  I can't put into words how bad the pain is and the black hole that just sucks your entire being into it.  And only Josh will know what I'm talking about when he reads it.    And I would rather be stabbed through the heart than see him go through this because I know how much it hurts.  But he has to find himself.  Josh, when you read this, take my advice:  find yourself.  Make time to be alone and find yourself.  No one can know the true Josh until Josh knows the true Josh.  Not Rosie, not me, not Leigh, not anybody.  It is hard as hell to break out of the little shell your used to living in.  Mine was the world of music; that may be yours, I don't know.  It's that thing that makes you feel better, but draws you away from the world.  That thing that sucks you in and doesn't let you breathe.  Whatever that thing is, you have to let it go, not totally, just don't obsess about it.  Everything in moderation, that's the key.  Josh, you're like the brother I never had and it hurts me so badly to see you going through all this.  Call me anytime you just need someone to listen.  Know your true self, Josh, and once you let that self out, things will just sort themselves out.    It takes trust too, in both yourself and in others who need to see the real you.  I lived (and still do to an extent) by the motto "trust no one and you'll never get hurt."  That's not all true.  Trust hurts, yeah, it really really does, but it also brings great joy if you let it.  Just be cautious of people.  Filter the ones that can hurt you.  Just remember that the ones that love you most also hurt you most.  It's a really overwhelming concept.  It starts making sense after awhile.  Just think about it.

      This whole thing with Josh is really getting out of hand.  It's just a freaking girl.  If I can get over my stuff, he can get over his.  We're in high school for Christ's sake.  It's not like we're trying to decide who we're going to marry.  Sorry.  Just my little rant.

      Lindsey, First, I'm sorry about Christy Stickney, next I'm coming down with something to, however I'll probably be in school.  Our DI team might be really screwed (you and Z out, me in a stupor, that leaves Rosie, Josh, and Sarah, nothing personal, but Rosie and Josh don't know much and I don't think Sarah can lead us alone)  most of the classes are coming to a near standstill because a third of the people are gone.  Sumner County got out on friday because of illness.  I hope you all get better soon.  see some of you on monday.

      Thanks, Josh.  Hate posting twice in a row.  Anyway, went for blood work today.   Definitely  not back at school next week.  Don't know what the hell is wrong with me yet.  Who knows what's happening.  Anyway, please say a prayer for my parents' good friend, Christy Stickney.  She has leukemia and just got a bronchial infection (which, most of you [except Z] probably don't know, totally lowers your immune system because leukemia attacks your blood cells and bone marrow.)  They were going to do a bone marrow transplant, but now she's so weak they can't do it.  She's probably not going to be with us much longer.  And that's about it for me.  All I do now is sleep.  On the bright side though, I have lost about eight pounds in a little less than a week.  Can't complain too much about that, now can I?  The best part though, is that I have a bet going on with my mother to see who can lose ten pounds the fastest.  I win!!!  Bad thing though, is that she'll probably say the bet is off cause I cheated by getting sick.  So, yall have a good weekend.  See you sometime in February I hope.  Probably can't go to my HUGE forensics tournament in Gatlinburg, which REALLY PISSES ME OFF, but I'm getting over it.  Slowly.  Rosie, have a good time at Mystery dinner tomorrow night.  And Elizabeth, I hear you're sick so GET BETTER OR CALL ME!!!  There's no excuse for lying in that bed bored when your best friend is at home in the same condition!!!  I'll call you tomorrow afternoon, though.  Hope to hear from yall soon, and yall BETTER HAVE A DI MEETING BEFORE I COME BACK!!!!  And Will, I'm expecting you [and Sarah] to organize and lead that, because you're the only ones who have done this before.  Anyway, I really am leaving now.  I'll let you know what the doctors say if you want to know.  Bye.

      Good morning, everyone.  This is the first time I've awakened in almost 24 hours.  Anyway, there is no way I'm going to be able to make it to the meeting.  And, bad news:  I most likely won't be at school next week.  I relapsed and have taken a turn for the worse.  So it looks like yall have a few extra days to enjoy the lack of my presence.  Happy Snow Day!!!  Yes, even I'm happy about it.  THat's two days of work I don't have to make up!!!

      Elizabeth-if Lindsay is up to it then the only one that would not be there is Rosie.  Sarah thinks we should run through the problem at least once and there is another type of Instant Challenge that they sometimes give that we need to practice.  My schedule is open just about any day except Monday, Elizabeth can't do Friday, Rosie can't do weekend, Josh said he was open, Sarah can do "nearly any" day, and I haven't heard from Lindsey.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok, I'm slowly and painfully getting over it.  And thanks for posting so much, yall.  Gives me a few minutes unboredness.  Rosie - it looks like yall are going to have to work the DI thing without me for a while.  Will and Sarah know what they're doing, so listen to them.  They just need to come up with some instant challenges, then have you play a little scum, but we really do need to break out "Taboo" (the game where you have to guess a word without saying certain other words)  Maybe I'll be feeling better by the weekend and we'll be able to get together.

      Snore snore all, what's up.  Just thought I should post in this fine but slightly sickened environment because we're suffering from the same thing.  That's right.  Boredom.  Heh, what were you expecting? I am bored out of my socks, and tired, I was up all last night and people kept calling me all morning 'til my dad got a call at about nine and I figured, there's no more sleep for me, so BLAM, I got up. Five hours is what I normally get anyway.  But more bored...my lack of energy probably contributes to it.  So ya, how's it going Lindsey? Still fighting the good fight I hope. Be expecting a call in fifth period or so tomorrow, slight chance I  might  not, my phone's battery is realllllllllly on the blink.  I hope you've consumed about 3593462457561053249132065137 cans of chicken soup by this point, that's what I do in about an hour. Chicken soup is AWESOME when you're sick.  Unless you don't have any guts intake this meager 3593462457561053249132065127 cans, which I must sorrily attest that I didn't.  God, mono sucks.  Patience and recovery be with ye.

      I know!  God, that guy gets on my nerves.  He thinks he Gods gift to the world.  * Oh, snap! *  ;)  Anyway, I spent today watching movies: What Women Want, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, Gone With the Wind, Dirty Dancing, and a couple of episodes of Trading Spaces. ( Z, you should have seen Genevieve - she started crying because this couple didn't do their homework!)  THis is getting old fast.  Call me, people!

      Depends on my mood.  I don't think so...I've discovered that I don't really feel as much animosity towards her as I used to.  It still hurts a little--it always will--but I don't think that I would do it.  Now Chris Slack...;)  But that's another story.  ~Z

      I'm glad mine's not that bad.  Maybe it's just a mild case.  Apparently 15 kids couldn't go on choir retreat because they were sick.  That really sucks.  Jennifer Powell called me last night right after I hung up with Elizabeth to remind me just how much fun I'm NOT having.  Anyway, I'll talk to yall later.  Oh, and Elizabeth, would you wish it on Bucky?

      Hey all...  In case you haven't noticed, something's wrong with the publishing on this BLog, i.e.: it doesn't go to the site, and hasn't since Sunday. I'd suggest changing templates, as the BLog genius has no idea how to fix this, or is too lazy, one or the other.  So there. DI, 5 to 7 tomorrow? Ok.  Latr.

      Goodness gracious, sounds like fun.  I hope you just  TASTE  the sarcasm.  Well, I dunno about Badvision, it doesn't seem to want me to reinvite anyone for now...I'll give it some time, but it keeps saying "404 Page Not Found" when I go to the invite page. *sigh*  We'll see.  Recouver-vous.

      Whoa.  Bad relapse.  No school next week, it does look like.   So, Josh, are we getting put back on Antiphilanthropy, or are we permanently out?  Rosie, call me if you want to talk.  I've spent the last couple of days watching the Westminister Dog Show on USA.  The Boxer came in third.  "Mick" the blue terrier one.  He was really good.  Yeah, well, you see what my life has come to.  So, what is happening with yall? I can't really say anything since my life consists of sleeping and watching dog shows.  Don't even eat.  I've lost an official 10 pounds now.  Don't really look that different though.  'Tis too bad.  I'll see yall sometime this month, I hope, I hope. Come visit me or at least call!

      Hey all, don't know why, but everyone got booted except the people getting invited and me, and every time I try to send a reinvite, it says "page not found". I'll keep trying...just wanted to clear things up a little.

      Ok, and he deleted my post...not that I can blame him, but still...freedom of speech!  So what's up with this?  Is Leigh Anne back or is Josh just pissed?  Rosie or Josh one, you better call me and explain.  I mean FAST, because my "frustration" level is rising quickly.  Will and Liz, hope yall are feeling better.  Fotgot that on my other schpiel, and I don't feel like editing.

      Ok, what happened?  Where's Josh's blog?  It was probably the whole rant about Brittany, but you know.  Anyway, so Abby came and visited me today.  She brought me a teddy bear that we named Howard and Abby-made chocolate chip cookies.  Yum!  Yall, I think i'm getting better so if you want to come visit me, just drop on by.  I'm not contagious unless you drink after me or kiss me ( ha hahahaha!!!!)  Yeah, like any of yall would do that.  Anyway, tomorrow I'm going to call Josh and figure all this out.  I probably owe him an apology.  Note:  I'm not good with those.  So, I'll see yall later.

      Thanks, yall.  Again, won't be at church tomorrow.  Will, REST.  Don't you dare go to school if you're feeling bad.  You'll just relapse or make yourself even more sick.  Liz, I hope you'll be back too, because make-up work sucks, but like I told Will, don't go unless ou are REALLY up to it.  Rosie, CALL ME tomorrow after you get home from church.  Hope you had fun at mystery dinner.  I want details.  I'll talk to you then.  It's late, so I'm cutting it short tonight.  Those of you who are sick, get better soon.  Those of you who are well, stay well.

      Ok, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse...   My homebound teacher came today, and after seeing I have done a big bunch of nothing, left shortly after.  But she had awakened me before my usual waking-up time, which is about 6:00 pm.  So I went to sleep, waiting for Whit to get home.  I woke up about 4:30, and she got home a few minutes later.  So we went downstairs to watch the Jubi tour video (Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat) and we were having a lot of fun just talking and stuff, when I get really tired, so I go upstairs to sit down.  After about an hour, my headache went away, and I started working on my History.  I worked for 2 hours, and got 1 section done.  Then I noticed that my shoulder was hurting really badly, so I felt it, and there was this huge lump on it.  I got my mom to look at it, thinking it was probably some random zit or something, but no, I can't be that lucky.  I have been bitten by a brown recluse.  Yup, that's my luck, so now I can hardly move my right arm.  I am tired, lonely, and in pain.  And I'm not exactly happy.  Good Night.

      Yeah, but I may not be able to go.  Still sick, and my mom is threatening me with maybe not going to Regionals.  May not even go to San Antonio for Spring Break, which would totally suck.  And my mom is insisting on staying home with me next week, even though she was supposed to go to Florida with my dad.  I feel like I'm screwing everyone's life up.  God, I shouldn't have gone out to eat last night.  I got so much worse.  Today I slept until 6:15 pm or so.  But I do know Algebra.  My daddy caught me up to where I should be.  Now I only lack Chemistry, Euro AP, Spanish, English, and Choir.  Yay.  And I can't even sit up for more than five minutes.  Sorry.  I'll quit complaining now.  It's just that I'm out of the loop socially and academically, and it's really frustrating me.  I don't know what's going on anywhere.  I'm a people person and the only people I have seen in the past month are my family and Abby.  I think I'm going to die if I don't get some social time soon.  Which could be a big problem considering I can't leave my house, especially since I went out for like 30 minutes last night and wound up bed-ridden.  Ugh.  Josh, thanks for checking the blog out for me.  Appreciate it.  I only get like 5 or 10 minutes on the computer every day because it's exhausting.  Yeah, I know, I know. I'm sitting down, so what's the big deal?  I don't know.  It just happens.  Anyway, so I don't want to spend all my time trying to fix something that I don't know anything about.  So anyway, I don't know if I'll actually see yall this month at school or not.  But you're welcome to come visit.  But yall have lives, so you don't have to.  I'll see yall later.

I'm the happiest person in the world, I do believe.  Ok, so it's just to a restaurant that I've gone to, like almost every day of my life, but you know, public is public.  La, la, la, la, la, la, sing a happy song!  I have on make-up and I feel slightly human again!  I'm sooooooooooo happy!!!  La, la, la, la, la!

      Heheh ok...um, I'd have to be an admin to fix this...if it isn't already, since the publishing problem worked out ok. You'd have to check inside your template settings and look for the text that's being used somewhere in the HTML, look for a number next to the text....  You know, I'm probably just talking out my ass. Most of the HTML I do know is because of BLog, and that has taught me very little but enough to get me by. As for this...  Whoa.

      Sorry, yall.  I'm not feeling well.  As most of yall know, no school for me this week.  Maybe next week, but then only 6th & 7th because I'm apparently very weak.  Then the weekafter that I'll add 5th, then the next, 3rd and 4th, then the next 1st and 2nd.  And Z, did you find out anything about choir?  Ok, I'm outta here.  Internet's been down for a couple of days.  Well, not really down, but it took my home page almost an hour to come up, so I figured it wasn't worth it.  Anyway, now I have a fast connection on  2  computers because my daddy is a genius.  And, Josh, can you fix whatever is wrong with my blog, because, if you haven't noticed, I'm pretty inept when it comes to stuff like that. I'll see yall eventually. Bye.

Ok, well, now it's after 11, but I ate breakfast.(grits and they take a while to make)  I'm happy...no school for me either, today.  My homebound was supposed to come, but she's not.  YAY!!! So, anyway, how are yall celebrating the snow day?  Have fun for me.  I'll be in my usual spot on the recliner. Oh, last night (at 2am, no less) I finished all my AP, all my Alg.II, and most of my vocab. Maybe all of it.  Does anyone know what lesson  we are on?  I'll see yall later.

      Sure, I think...not to sure about this format though...I can work with what you have, that is to say, there's nothing I can work with with this BLog format (the big blue blocks). So if you would be willing to change it, I could find one that would suit your purposes. As for graphics, you'd have to pay the necessary $35 to upgrade to BLoggerPro, and it goes back to the regular $50 in a few weeks here...not that you care :) heh, o well. There's other sites that function like this one, such as  urlLink blurty.com , but it doesn't have a team function...on the other hand, you can design the layout  however  you want it. And since you won't do this because you're using this  for  the Team function in the first place, it's just a little more extraneous information that makes this site what it is:  A rant site.

      Sorry, I didn't know if yall had done that yet.  But I just checked and it's fixed.  You're a genius.  I'm un-administrating yall now.  Oh, and I went out in public today.  To Whitney's school.  They were doing their DI thing, which I didn't get to see because I was sick.  They were REALLY good.  I almost didn't believe that they had written it themselves.  Anyway, Kelly Reedy and Julie Catterton came to visit today.  I learned how to play gin, which is ALMOST as fun as Scum.  Anyway, so I'll see yall Monday, I think.

Anyway, Josh, I'm sorry the school is sucking your brain out your earlobes again, Josh.  Just when I thought they had stopped... So, I guess I'll see yall Monday.  And Josh and/or Will, have you figured out how to fix this or if it's fixable?

WELLLLLL very groovy, cannot wait to see ye back in the Pit, this acidic, stinking, rotten cesspool of dismemberment and decay, this festering maggot heap that drags my entrails from my lifeless body and sucks my brains through my earlobes, big ol' AKA to all of this, school.

      Yeah, Josh did it. And now on to BIG newses.  #1. I'm 99.9% sure that I'm coming back to school (only 6th and 7th pds.) on Monday!!!!! (but I'm gonna TRY to see yall)  And the biggest news is #2.  I'm going on a cruise (yes, another one) to the carribean after we go to San Antonio... I guess that means more pressure on me to get well. So, I guess I'll be gone all of Spring Break.   Also, I MAY be @ church on Sunday, but definitely NOT at choir.  I'm seriously happy.  But, Liz, that does NOT get you off the hook from coming to visit me.  Yall, I'm SO glad I'm coming back.  I feel a buttload better, and I'm caught up in almost all my classes. So, I guess I'll see yall Monday.  YIPEE!!!!!!!  Wow, did that come out of my mouth...er, keyboard?

      Wellllllll.......  The thing is that this retarded little mechanism like to delete the oldest posts every once in a while to save room for the entire BLog server. That's why the story of Tinblogged is always a little unclear, because there were posts before the "dark marks" one that I had forgotten about, simply because they weren't there. I'll try and republish, but if that doesn't work, I dunno what will, soorrrrrrriiiieeee!!!  Okie.

      I'm trying.  I actually showered today without falling asleep within.  It was wonderful.  And I talked on the phone.  I'm thinking accomplishment.  And Josh, more audio blogs, please.  That was the coolest thing I've ever seen...er, heard, in my entire life!!!!!!  That's, what the second or third time you've been the "maker of my day"  Yesterday it was my favorite kid to baby-sit.  His name is Oliver, and we've been buds since he was like 2, but now he's 8.  Anyway, he heard I was sick and brought me 2 dozen roses cause they're his favorite, and like a dozen daisies, cause they're my favorite, and an Easter lily thing, cause they're his mom's favorite.  How sweet was that?  I think I'm in love....heeheeheeheehee!!!!!!!

      Well, she's definitely not Rosie.  Not even close.  Not half that loud or obnoxious.  Just kidding, of course.  Oh, and I got a package from my grandparents today.  I got $20 and Whit got $20.  I think she's glad I'm sick now.  I also got this HUGE bag of skittles.  I mean, we're talking buttloads of skittles.  And I got these two cute little stuffed animal things.  They are SO soft.  I don't think my grandmother has quite gotten over the fact that I'm not three anymore, but hey, I don't mind.  I like the cute stuff in life.  Oh, speaking of gifts, Abby got me the most gorgeous necklace I believe I've ever seen.  We're going to go to the store she bought it at (which is in Franklin) when I get to feeling better.  She also brought me two yummy chocolate covered strawberries and one of those fizzy things to put in the bathtub.  It smells really good.  I don't think guys really get the whole bath thing, but you girls know what I'm talking about.  Ah, the joys of bathing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going.  So anyway, I'll see yall later.

      Because she's one of my very bestest friends.  Only Z knows her.  Her name is Abby and she's one of the coolest people I know.  She's a gourmet chef and spoils me to no end.  Umm, she goes to my church, but she goes to FRA.  :(  I want her to come to BHS next year.  *crosses my fingers*  She's visited me like a million billion times while I've been sick.  So, we'll just have to wait and see if she accepts.  Oh, and yall be nice to her.

      Thanks, yall.  That makes me feel better.  I went to the piano and I bought some sheet music, and then my mommy took me and my sister out to Rafferty's.  Then I came home around 1:30 and slept until now.  It was a good day, but I'm very tired, so I'm going to go back to bed now.  Good Night, all.  Oh, and we may be getting a new blogger soon...we'll just have to wait and see.

PLEASE  come back, it's been weird without you there, it's getting weirder with that black space of empty desk in front of me/Z.  We'll see you when we do.

      Sorry, sorry, don't need the bass players anymore, we have two more potentials were going to try before I trouble you/anyone else with a possible job offer. As for wildness, it's something we could use, never enough wildness.  And tryouts are today....  Pardon me while I start crying.

      Um...I may know a guy who plays bass, but I'll have to talk to him.  I'll try to come to church next week or sometime so you can meet Gaddis, though.  He's a little on the wild side.

      Gaddis sounds like the better one...  Since most of our songs are electric...in fact, all of them are, except for the solo acoustic bit at the end of our set.  And we'll need a bassist too, since pauvre Tyler is gone after the talent show, the kid just doesn't know what he's doing...  Of course, that's just between us.

      All right.  I'll talk to Gaddis and/or J.H. You never specified what type of guitar.  And you don't have to worry about them showing off...too much.  J.H. can be really quiet, he reminds me a lot of you, Josh.  Gaddis (whose first name is Matt, I just always call him Gaddis) is a little wilder than those in your band.  J.H. would be a better fit I do believe, but he only plays acoustic, I think.  Gaddis can play like any instrument.  And then, if you want to teach me.... yeah, right.  Oh, and no school for me tomorrow.  Sorry yall.

      *sigh* SADNESS! Mine Yankness is done, therefore.  I know a lot, too. I'm just looking for one that's not a total show-off, one that would contribute to  the band  rather than  one's self ...si vous comprenez...new rule, no foreign languages, n'est-ce pas? Heh. But yeah, it would also help if I knew this person. The fabric of sucessful bands lie in their friendship rather than their will to jam. Most of those bands expire in a year or so; though we haven't had that test of time up to now, I'm betting we'll last for a long while. We haven't become sick of each other yet: moreover, we're sick of our NHS oppressors making us chop our song to little bits.   But after the talent show, I'd be willing to try anything. I'll come and check them out next week, if that would be ok (I was at Alex's all weekend).  Have fun with your weekend all, I have to start practicing :(

      All right.  This is my last post before I get on board the ship.  All yall staying home, keep up with the blog.  I  I'm leaving tomorrow at 10:00am for the plane.  We'll get there around 5:00 Florida time. (that's 4:00 our time)  We're leaving out of Miami Monday at 5:00pm, but I'll probably be on the boat by noon, since we've been on this line before a couple of times, so we're in the captain's club(which just basically means we get on first and get special treatment...kind of.  It basically means that we get on early and if we go on enough cruises then we get a set of chmpagne glasses.  We already got one because this old man thought my little sister was cute (in a non-perverted way...He was like, 80, and she was about 7) so he struck up a conversation with my mother, and he and my father worked in the same business, so they really got along well.  He had been on something like 25 cruises, just on Celebrity, and so they gave him champagne glasses, and he gave them to my mother.  He was so sweet; he would like kiss mine, my mom's and Whitney's hands when he met us, and would give a little bow when he saw my father.  He was the most gentlemanly man I have ever met in my entire life.  Anyway, I'm going off on a totally different tangent than I meant to.  I'll be back either Friday or Saturday, depending on what we decide to do.  So, um, you guys, get back on the blog, and get ready (I have a feeling) to laugh at loud at my wonderful Spring break.

      Heehee...Olde English...I love it!!!  Well, I am also packing, and loving it, which is saying a lot since I usually despise it.  We leave on Sunday, and get on the cruise on Monday.  The father hath spoken, however, and apparently, the only way I will be traveling (other than car and airplane) is by wheelchair.  Yay.  One of those, as my little sister so graciously pointed out, has one of those ten foot tall flags on it.  So not only do I have to ride in a wheelchair, but a wheelchair that just  screams  "Look, I'm riding in a wheelchair."  Let's just say I'm not happy about this.  But on a good note, I am leaving here in a few minutes to get a manicure and pedicure.  I hate going though, because the people will only talk in Vietnamese, and then they laugh, and I think they have to be talking about me, because otherwise, why would they have to speak Vietnamese.  Next time, I think I'll take Josh, so he can tell me if they say "doll" or "uncle."  Um, also, I bought 3 new pairs of shoes.  YAY!!!!  Not like the guys really care, but for Rosie's and Elizabeth's sakes, one is a formal white pair to go with churchish stuff, one is white, and made out of like this hemp stuff, and it has those like browny, neutral colored beads in it (that's for casal dresses, skirts, and white capris; they go with anything, and the other is a denim pair to go with my denim skirt and capris and stuff.  They have this little buckle type thing on the top.  They are so adorable.  And they all have really cute heels, but none of them are that tall.  Ok, sorry for boring you, guys.  Oh, my puppy is being so cute.  We got mulch delivered today so that William can put it out sometime this weekend, and she's trying to climb it, but she's not succeeding.  I think her feet are too big.  Awww, isn't that cute?  Ok, i gotta go.  See yall later.

      Haha, we'll I can see how this would be funny. Back when I first met Leigh Anne a lot of her friends started talking to me, and since they saw my picture they thought I  must  be at  least  sixteen, at LEAST. So they started hitting of me and trying  very hard  to be mature, to the point of causing not undue blushing on my part, but most of the time it was HILARIOUS to see these (what, children?) people talking so grown up as they did and not knowing that I would think a damned thing other than:  "Hey, I must be just a growed up as them."

      HAHAH, here's a funny story.  Josh ascended the stairs after reading The Blog, a site dedicated primarily to the vastly interwoven lives and troubles of a few students at BHS, an oppressed sort who really couldn't give a shit less what anyone thought of their methods. So it was that they started a BLog with Lindsey Reid as its leader, and therein their worldly and strange issues came to life upon the Internet for the world to see.  Weeks passed, the BLog was filled with odd topics: a strange tale of the boy Josh and a girl named Leigh Anne, the endless mental struggle of one of the sites lesser contributers, Rosie, and the endless wisdoms of the entity known as Will, who responded without fail where needed.  But it came to be one day that Lindsey was scheduled for a cruise, and through some twist of fate, she met Mitch.  Mitch was a confusing boy. At first, it was thought that he was a nicer sort, a calm variety, charming and appealing, but time has a strange way of breaking these confines and showing people for reality. It was that Mitch's ambition and stupidity bled through and together one day, and he began hitting on Lindsey, much to her and the rest of the Bloggers' knowledges, without much subtlety. As his forwardness wore on, the BLog was posed with an interesting question: who the HELL is this guy?  The question in Josh's mind, however, was "what is grind dancing?". He ascended those stairs to his sister's room, his sister, the dancer of years. Surely, she would know this strange sort of dancing.  "Hey Kate," said Josh, opening the door and looking to his sister, who was busily working on a project and talking on the phone simultaneously. "Hey," she said, turning her attention to the slightly-longer-than-it-should-be haired boy. It was an assorted rarity that he would ever bother her sister, and the abberation from the norm was actually welcomed in a nearly invariable life.  "Umm, got a question, I thought you would know," "Shoot," "'Kay, what is grind...dancing?" Her eyebrows suddenly shot up and she stuttered a bit, laughing nervously, as if stopping herself from blurting some awful truth. Josh suddenly felt embarrased and said, "Oh...it's " bad " stuff isn't it?" "Haha," she started with an orai smile, "it  is ,"  It came to pass that Josh became extremely wary of the Mitch person, instantly went out and bought Lindsey an easily concealable shotgun, which he loaded with  SLUGS , because he wanted to make ready-sure that if the Mitch kid were to put his "grind" moves on (and for those who haven't put the pieces together yet, take the name of the dance and apply it to two human bodies) that Lindsey would be well-equipped to deal with the perverted youngster with due finality. Though all applauded the boy's forwardness and utter "balls", they also jeered it, and laughed at him ever after, until they all had hemmorages and died.  Summary: I ask my sister what grind dancing is, she flips out because it's a "bad" dance, as in morally wrong. Uhoh. I thought he was an idiot, now not only to I know, but I can also tack on the adjective "horny" to that "idiot".   O ye gods, what shall you do? :) Hope you're having TONS of fun with this situation.

      Will, yeah, this is his first cruise, and this is like my sixth, and I've been on one with a similiar layout.  Josh, I'm flattered that you're thinking of me in Euro. :)  I'm not sure why I'm still talking to him.  Maybe I just need someone's head to play with, or maybe my subconscience is actually considering him, I don't know.  I guesss we'll see how it goes.  There is a internet cafe on board, so I'll definitely update you as we go along.  I'll get his last e-mail to you in just a sec...

      Wow, that got a response, which was all I really wanted, but yeah, I personally thought he was trying too hard, but hey, it's four days, what can it hurt?  I mean, he lives in Indiana.  Not like I'll ever see him again.  And it's not like I want a boyfriend that I knew for four days that lives out of state.  Anyway, thought you guys might like that.

      Heh WHOAAA.  I missed a little something here and there. HEEEYYAA everybody, I just got back, much too excited to start BLogging again. Florida was fun, but it gets repetetive. One can only stand getting their brains fried out so many hours and days. The left side of my torso bears testament to that. And my nose. And my feet. And my waistline. And the undersides of both my cook-ed arms. And on and on and on. It was  so  warm on those beaches though, and music sounds a thousand times better there. And it's  WARM .  It was really great until I saw a school bus passing by the resort on the way to the beach one morning, and it ruined my entire life. I broke down in tears on the streetcorner right there, leaking sweat and SPF 30 from my eyes, clutching my burned arms to my chest and drawing them away quickly as it hurt a world of hurt. And of course, this whole story, or as much as I care to tell, in poetic detail on my  urlLink BLog , and as I feel like typing it. I just want to read stuff and sit back and catch up now. TRUST ME, I'm getting my fill of that with all the DI emails and such.   Ciao mes amis, goot (yes, that is a "t") to be back.

      I thought of something else worthwhile.  I didn't have to ride in the wheelchair.  I feel SOOOOOO much better.  I'm wondering if it's because I actually got over it, or if it was because I met Michael...hmmm.  Doesn't really matter..I'm not contagious anymore, and that's all that's important.

      Ok, I'm deleting my last couple of posts, and once again there is probably going to be a new blogger here, if I can talk him into it, but I'll take a vote to see if yall want him to come on or not.  His name is Michael Burk.  I met him on the cruise, and he is the most wonderful guy I believe I've ever met in my entire life. (No offense, Josh and Will) He's from Indiana, and I miss him like no other.  I think I've cried for almost 18 hours straight now for lack of seeing him (You tease me about that and I'll kick your ass till you can't sit down).  Oh, um, in case your wondering, um, yes we're going out (took a real genius to figure out that one)  He plays football, dresses kind of like a prep, but doesn't act like one at all.  Hmmmm....what else to say...I don't know.  I just want yall to get to know him, I guess.  So tell me what you think.  Yay or nay???  And no "I don't cares" Vote one way or another.  I'm taking all the Mitch posts off of here.  In case you haven't guessed, I didn't meet him.  Met a better guy instead.  After I met Michael, I could not have cared less who I did and didn't meet.  I'll tell you more about the cruise later, if I can think of anything else worthwhile.

Ummm...Can't wait to find out about how this cruise goes, Linds.  And...when you get home, prepare for a LONG phone call...there's something I need to talk to you about.  Don't worry, it's not about you...it's about me.  ~Z

      1) I posted, and it didn't post.  2) What is ERS?   Also, does anyone want concert tickets?  Josh, it's a Christian band, and not "life metal" either, so you probably don't want them.  I'm going at six, but it started about 2 hours ago.  It's at Amsouth, so it's only the side stages that are playing right now.  Anyway, I'll see yall Monday. And DI people, check your e-mail.

      The Mellow Mushroom is a restaurant near Vanderbilt University. It's really cool but it takes atleast 20min for toe food to arrive because they cook it after you order it and since we had a big group it took like 40 min. It was ok though because I brought card and we played ERS. Zach Craft is fast!

      You're going to the Mellow mushroom?  Very cool.  Too bad about Riley not calling...I'm serious, because that either means that hopefully, he forgot, or more likely, that he'll call tonight when they're home.  Just make sure you answer EVERY incoming phone call.  Josh, no one is e-mailing Michael.  They're just kidding.  I'll see yall tonight. Over and out.

      Good luck in DI. While you guys are improving I'll be playing piano in the sevice then flying down to mellow mushrooms for dinner then to the Sportsplex so I can break some bones on the ice....kidding....Kinda. Anyway, yes the Curran thing was fun and I would do it again after the AP exam. Also Riley hasn't called yet to tell my parents what an awful student I am.....hopefully he won't. Gifted is going well as long as I don't fail the verbal part. That's my life in a nutshell. Bye!

      Ah yes Michael, you are correct. She goes to a different school, but everyone there hates everyone here, and vice versa. It was pretty hard to keep that relationship going long, first with the pressure within it, and what worse, pressure from everyone attacking everyone else. It was a battle for a hile there.  By the way, whom of these good friends keep sending these bastard emails about you and Lindsey breaking up? Jesus H. Christ, it seems like you're constantly under attack, and I'm positive you're a quality guy. It just bewilders me as to why someone would keep up this kind of an attack.  Why yes, Lindsey, Jackie only posted on here once, and it was about her and her fianc or something like that; it was really quick. And I shall be there, of course.  Have a  GREAT  day everyone, life is  SO  wonderful.

      Z, it wasn't Michael that knew about Witchblade, it was some other guy from Chicago whose I name I have forgotten, though I vaguely remember saying it was Michael.  I believe that may have just been a brain fart, though.  I'll see if Whit remembers his name, because it was her friend's brother.   All right, Michael is sending pictures, so I should have those soon. YAY!!!  Um, I'm trying to get Jackie on here to introduce herself, but we all know how often she shows up...In my memory, it is once, but you never know.  May be more than that.  Rosie and I went to Chik-Fil-A with Mr. Curran and Thomas (his son) today.  Lots of fun.  Also went to Cat's Music and Planet Exchange...good stuff at Cat's, not at Planet Exchange.  I do believe I could live at Cat's Music.  But they took the hippie store out.  I'm so upset!  That's where I got my Lennon shirt!  OK, I';m over, I think, but still, I liked the lady that worked in there.  Her name was like Rainbow or Sunshine or something like that.  Very cool.  Oh, well...Tomorrow is DI, so be at my house at six.  We'll do something for supper...Chinese takeout, maybe; don't really know.  We'll see when yall get here.  All right, that does it for me.

      Nice post Josh, i can defintely hear the voice when i read it.   Its recreational soccer, no competition, and i'm not that great.    Lindsey, the only spelling i care about is people's names, it's like calling me "weel" instead of will. the worst sound to a person's ears is their name said wrong, its the same with typing.  (by the way, the translation of this paragraph is it's fine when i do it but when someone else, especially Rosie, does it, its all wrong)

      Sorry Z, I don't think I have seen Witchblade, and don't worry about torture.  I live 8 hours from my lady love.  How much more could it hurt?  And if I did ever break up with Linds, She'd kick my ass. (not like I have any plans anyway)  I take it from some of the posts that Leigh Anne is the manipulative b**** of the group.  We've got some of those in Indiana.  I heard one girl say that she liked this guy, but he had a girlfriend already.  Her friend said, "That's not a problem, I can show you how."  Isn't that what friends are for?   Will sounds like my kind of guy, except for the soccer part.  Our football coach swiftly kills any word of a soccer team, and for good reason.  The former rival school added a soccer team, their football teams's record last year was like 1-10.  Hey Linds Why does that have to be a rhetorical question?  Maybe you'd better email me that answer................................................ Oh, and which one of your hmm, good friends, shall we say, told you to break up with me for April Fools?  That is the definition of medieval torture.  Love you too.

      Okay, okay, I get it!  No more threatening newcomers with torture.  Jeez.  ;)  Anyway, my second post was originally longer.  For some reason it didn't come out, and I just want to try again.  Linds said that you had seen Witchblade, Michael.  What did you think, and how much have you seen?  This show is my obsession...well, one of many, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on the subject.  As for the rest of you, thank you for making sure that Michael knows I'm insane.  Wouldn't want him to suffer from any false images of me.  Great last few posts, Josh and Will.  Talk to you later, and you guys, check your e-mail.  NOW.  ~Z

      (Sweet.)(That was a cool post.)(I feel like I'm whispering with an icy voice when I use parenthesis on everything.)  (It might have been a Leigh Anne ploy.)(Last night we were talking about being friends, which she sees as a definite impossibility.)(I don't care, click  urlLink here  to see why.)(She said Lizzy stole my number from her and called it; YEAH RIGHT, I surely believe that.)(Seth had more fun when he got home, as he called Lizzy about three more times.(I was on the phone with Leigh and Lizzy was talking to her on AIM.)(She was freaking out, it was the funniest thing ever.)(But anyway.)  (Yeah, can't you just hear me doing a lounge singer voice with this text?)(So cool.)  (Alright, I'm done doing drugs.)

      Yeah, Will's just the one who makes us the butts of his jokes.  No one hates him, except Rosie, but I do believe the feeling is mutual.  Oh, and Will, if you're going to make fun of spelling, you need to check your own (knoledge?) But seriously, you play soccer?  Yeah, you see how well I know him, and I consider him a good friend.  We all tease him, but we all (even Rosie, deep down) love him.  But yeah, he could teach the classes with all he knows, which, by the way, is more than the teachers (especially the Robo-bitch, right, Will?)  Wow.  I just looked back at my post.  I kind of went parenthesis happy, did I not?

      Rosie, you have not the slightest clue about medieval tortures and we all know it, quit trying.  Additionally,  Rosei , SPELL PEOPLE'S NAMES RIGHT!  Michael, not Micheal, welcome to the Blog, I'm Will, I play Soccer, correct teachers for fun, and spend the rest of my time sleeping.  I have a knoledge of medieval torture devices as well but I don't think Z needs my help and Lindsey is pretty good at taking care of herself.    ps I am not by any means strict on grammar unless it's Rosie who messes up.

      Sorry Z for my "sappiness." Ask Lindsey I was kind of in a down mood. Someone set me to thinking about how unfeeling I am. Sorry I guess but then again, why do I have to apologize for what I think?  Micheal welcome, Z is insane but kind and a great person to have proofread your essays but she also is well versed in medieval tortures. Look that up sometime, some of the devices are actually very efficient for what they were made for...extreme pain. Smile!

      Wait, so this is just another Leigh Anne ploy?  I'm vaguely remembering why I hate all MLK kids and Brittany so badly.  Why can't you just stay away from them?  That would make all of our lives a lot easier.  Tell Seth to keep up the good work, screwing with her and all.

      "You break her heart, I break your neck," said Vin Diesel in  The Fast and The Furious . That wast the the summary of the last part of Z's post. Vin Diesel is a horrible actor, but that line was fantastic in that movie.  Life screws everybody; I'm sort of a nihilist, so I have a belief that the basis of life is simply having problems. The second part of that, however, the non-nihilist half, says that life is also about dealing with and overcoming problems. Yes, it took me about...eight months now to formulate that belief, and a lot of emotional detailing and rearrangement and stuff, but it seems to be working very well for me.  Love is the last thing left? Tell that to the people  burning in hell . Muhahahahaha.  O yeah B-wood hoods, today on the bus, Brittany called Lizzie back and left a heathenistic message, imitating me. God, that girl. Thereafter, I call'd her and left a message. And then the shit hit the fan. I gave my cousin Seth Lizzie's number, whereafter he called and left a message confessing his undying love to her. Then she called me and asked if it was I who had left that message, I said no, she said, "OK, bye, sorry," Then, Seth managed to get the number from me via stealing my cell and taking the number off of it; he then left several messages asking her to get married, and eventually breaking up with her. Once he called the wrong number and asked some random lady out, via voicemail. He left his number on that one, and after it was over, I told him, "Dude, you just left your number," He just stared at me for a moment, and then called Lizzie back.  Uhoh, she was getting pissed after these, say, eight messages. She called my grandmother's and Seth answered. He started asking her questions, and someone Seth got our of her that  Leigh Anne was getting her to call me and leave these messages . So with a look of mild shock on my face, I tried to take the phone, listening in on Seth trying to get her to talk to me:  "So do you wanna talk to Josh?" "No," "Why?" "Because he's an asshole!"  Oops, everyone hates me. I picked up the next time she called and, while Seth was busy pledging his love to/breaking up with Lizzie, I was asking her how she got my number; through Leigh, who was asking her to leave messages.  I don't think she'll leave anymore though. She's getting really screwed up over Seth calling a thousand times.  Silly smart people at MLK, all full of themselves.

      Liz...BE NICE!!! I didn't bring him on here so you could scare him off.  Michael..Don't worry about her.  She's a little nuts at times, but you'll get used to it.  She's all talk; she'd never hurt a flea, but nobody's supposed to know that.  She's not too fond of Rosie at times, but she loves her really deep down.  Once again, she never carries out her threats.  She never gets in fights with Josh or Will though. I wonder why that is... I'm just kidding, Z, calm down.  Anyway, I'll see yall later.

      Oh, dear GOD!  Could you get ANY SAPPIER, Rosie?  Get over it.  I've had enough sappiness for a while.  Anyway, hello, Michael.  I extend you a warm welcome, even though this is not my Blog.  Do you prefer Michael or Mike?  Just curious.    Yes, you have finally met her, the one, the only...(drumroll) Z, the resident psycho, also known as Linds's best friend and Elizabeth to some lower-class plebians.  (No offense...you didn't know.)  I will probably be the only one who is generally correct in grammar and punctuation EVERY SINGLE TIME I POST.  I am also the resident Grammar Nazi, although Linds is fast approaching my fastidiousness.  And yes, this is how I talk much of the time.  ;)    Sooooooo...let's see.  I'm a good student, I love singing, I play handbells, and I love writing.  I hope that this thing with Lindsey works out.  Just keep in mind that if you hurt her in ANY way, I will be forced to use my extensive fondness and knowledge of painful, medieval tortures and you will pay.  Dearly.  Have a nice day!  ~Z

      Michael, I'll tell you about Mitch tomorrow when I talk to you.  Don't worry about him, I've never even met him. Not particularly fond of him either, I must say... And Josh, what have I told you about the yankee stuff...Not on MY blog, boy.  You've got your own.  Well, now yall have met Michael, and yes, I know he's the greatest guy in the world...You don't have to tell me.  Josh, guess what this means??? You are being dumped by your pretend "girlfriend" so now you can get back to the beloved Leigh (& gay guy and all of the rest of your fan club.)  I better go get the rest of the group to come on here so Michael doesn't think that we're all like Josh.  Hee hee...Naw, I luv ya, Joah. (*Note to Michael, this is not a typo but an endearing term to refer to Josh.  Used frequently.)  Elizabeth, I haven't read the Gladiator thing yet, but I'm getting to it.  Rosie, yes, be assured Curran wants you there, but if you can't come, I guess I'll just go with Lumley I guess.  That could be interesting...  Anyway, I better be going.  I'll see yall later.  I love you, Michael.

      Death threats, really? You'll settle in just nicely with this crowd, I get about a trillion a day from a few peo(ROSIE)ple.  OK, so I have no idea  who  exactly you are; that's the beaut of the 'net, though, we'll just get to know you through here and you could lie and give us the impression that your a charitable, wonderful star of a person when in fact thou art a blackhearted scoundrel. Heh, well I'd have to say you're a good guy, if Lindsey likes you, you must be pretty darned worthy, and Lindsey has finely-honed tastes in the selection of acceptable facets of humanity.  Don't worry about Mitch, he's just a name.  As for me, I'm the stupid one that everyone thinks they like because he's funny, even witty, I dare say, but in fact, are just laughing at him because he is stupid. And I would encourage you to do the same, if you feel so obliged, because it  fuels  me, hahaha. I would also like to add that I am the starkly emotional one, apt to whine about girls and how life is screwing me over, and just fresh off breaking up with a long-time obsession that isn't quite gone yet, mostly dealing with dreamsI've been having right now. Don't worry, you'll be as sick of the whining as everyone else is in about three hours, less depending on your "lil' whiny bitch tolerance level".   That's me, have fun BLogging.

      Hi guys, I'm Michael, Lindsey's new guy.  Yes, to all who care I am a prep.  I told one of my friends about the fact that evidentally us falling for each other is an earth-shaking event.  He said "You really are a prep in purest form."  Whatever that means.  So, I hear from Linds I've had a couple death threats.  Classy people.  At least this Elizabeth girl likes me, and Rosie.  Wow, I was just checking some of the history on this blog, but the one thing I want to know most of all is, who's Mitch?  Look, I don't really know any of you that well, so if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer.  I guess I should tell you about myself or something, like Lindsey said, I play football, I throw for track, I lift, I don't know.  I don't want to bore everyone.  I just know I met her Monday night/Tuesday morning a week ago.  Since 1:00AM Friday, I have been in a state of depression over the possibility of not seeing her again.  You guys don't know how lucky you are.  I gotta go, see ya.

      Ok, I'm gonna post this and youse goys are gonna probably stone me and call me an "X-Files freak" after I tell you about this, but I just  have  to.  I've been reading a lot about this little seen phenomenon lately. Everyone's heard of Roswell, you have your ritualistic alien sightings, you have Sasquatch; basically, your big myths. Well I was reading about one in this very informative BLog, click  urlLink HERE  to read it, about this seldom-seen natural phenomena as of a few months ago.  It's apparently a unit of the  Homo sapiens . It's a female, sub-phyla LINDSEY sub-genus REID. They say once in a blue moon you can see her waltzing into a fifth period European History lunch, but you have to look  REALLY HARD . And you guys won't believe this but... I SAW ONE TODAY . Didn't the rest of you? O saints, I flipped out! I saw it! Actually, you all did too, because this entire post is just a wheelbarrow of horsepuckey trailing back to the main point:    ~*H~*E*~*Y*~*A*~  ~*L*~*I*~*N*~*D*~*S*~*E*~*Y*~  ~*W*~*E*~*L*~*C*~*O*~*M*~*E*~  ~*B*~*A*~*C*~*K*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~    It was just like, "Whoa," when she walk'd in,  that  was unexpected. Well, I knew she'd be in at sixth, but JEEZ. Scaring us like that, what a welcome surprise. Welcome back to the grind Linds, at least a bit of it at a time, and good to seeith ye again.

      Yeah, yesterday was one of those days that nothing bad actually happened, it was just that, I don't know, mood, maybe, that makes it kind of a bad day.  It did turn around last night about 10:30, when Adam called.  For those who don't know, Adam is my favorite cousin, and I don't know...I practically idolize him for some reason.  Anyway, so he called and helped me with my Chemistry.  So I went to bed happy.

      I've been to that site that Michael was talking about. It's a bit impractical in that it takes words from what you type in and sets them to interpreting your dream, i.e.: raven, crow: preoccupation with death, a sense of haunting, or something like that. But it  can  make some sense if you let it.  You're right, yesterday wasn't a good day, and somehow today isn't looking so good either.

      I know a website that you can figure out what your dreams mean, go to Bored.com, there's a link to a site, I think it's called Freakydreams.com or something.  Anyway there are a lot of neat links, something to do during Study Hall.

      Ah, yes.  Michael and I were talking about how it was odd that the "h" and the "o" were in such different spots on the keyboard and yet you still managed that typo.  Anyway, sorry about 5th, yall.  I went home.  I think tomorrow I'm going to skip 1st and 2nd, and then go 3rd-7th.  I'm thinking that might be the best way to do it.  I went to sleep when I got home...some dreams are not pleasant.  I thought I'd gotten over that period in my life where like every dream is a bad one, but apparently not.  I thought for a while it just might be the mono, but now I don't know.  It's not like they're nightmares (scary) so much as just bad dreams (not good.)  All right, that's it for me.  I wonder if this post actually makes sense...

      That was one of the best concerts I've ever been to in my life, and everyone knows I'm not a big fan of Christian music (I think it all sounds the same) except for the Newsboys, who were there.  Ah, fire, smoke, and of course, CONFETTI!!!  It was all over everywhere.  Who knew confetti was actually more than a mess?  Anyway, lots of fun; Whitney got a T-shirt.  I was going to get the Newsboys one with Cap'n Crunch on the front (they have a song called "Breakfat, so it does make sense) but then I remembered that I was pretty much broke, so I didn't get it. It was really cute, though.  So, rosie, how was the 'shroom?  And may I ask what (and I quote) "toe food" is?

      JOAH! Stop it!   Everyone .... you did what you did at DI. It's good that we got to State without being last. Also considering what we were walking in with.....only 2 people that did improv before (compare that with Franklin that has done it with the SAME team ever since middle school) we did really well. We have an awesome team that will get even better. We know how to work with each other now we need to concentrate on how to work well under pressure which only putting ourselves under pressure will help. The experience will tell you how awful we can get. Now we get to look to better things. Cheer up all. I luv you all even though I act like I'm going to kill some of you most of the time. =). Congrats on living through State.

      No no, you remember what I told you at the picnic table right? I'm to blame for this; at least, I should be, because I might be the best, but I wasn't doing my best. There's something like a switch in my head when I have to do this kind of thing, and that day, it just wasn't turning on; I had a feeling as we were sitting in that hall that it wouldn't.  Not that it matters anymore, and I'm not concerning myself overly with it.   And thanks for quoting me :)

      We got 6th out of 7, although there were eight teams: a tie for 4th. Franklin  of course  got first and the Renaissance award, blahblahblah. An interesting side note: our friends at Hunter's Bend, the fan club, won and are going to Globals.   God, I sucked. But it's better to be numb than to let this eat us up.

I know he won't be onlne, but I'm still all, well, maybe he'll be there.  Whatever.  I didn't get your e-mail.  It wasn't there, so you'll have to resend it, or just print it off so I can look at it tomorrow.  Does anyone know what my english homework was?  I'm thinkin not, but its still worth a try.  Um...yup.  Peace out once again.

      Thanks for looking at the site.  Ok, the thing about the pants.  Well, I was reading this poem for english today, and one of the lines was like "I grow old...I grow old/ I shall wear the bottom of my pants rolled."  I thought that was funny and I wondered if it was true.  We also read a really random one about plums in the fridge.  It was cool.  Yup...anyway...fun stuff.  By the way, how could you not know there are drugs at Brentwood?  Also, speaking of books, do you still have Where the Heart is?  I don't need it, but I was just wondering.  And Julius Caesar...I think thats it.  Peace out!

      Ok, I looked through the ENTIRE website.  It looks  really  good!  The only thing I saw, and this is extremely nit-picky, but where it says "Multiple Sponsor      $70,000\number of sponsors" the \ needs to be a /.  That's it.  That's all I saw.  And I went in looking for things.  So, um, yeah.  I'm glad you and Kyndall got back together.  Heehee.  Oh, and one of my friends (Lindsey Baylor) gave me a book called "THe Perks of Being a Wallflower."  It's the best book I've ever read.  She said the main character reminded her of me, which, after reading it, I'm slightly offended, but still.  It's a little vulgar, and...um, descriptive...but it's REALLY good once you kind of get used to it.  I think Liz would enjoy it, and probably Abby, but I think it wouldn't be good for the rest of you, especially Rosie.  She's probably too...sheltered? I guess would be the right word... She didn't know there were drugs at Brentwood, for crying out loud (which is what a lot of the book is about, but still) anyway, Abby and Liz, I highly recommend it.  And Rosie, don't get all offended, it's the truth.  I don't think you could handle the book without having a breakdown.  Ok, I'm going now.

      Josh did great on his concert thing at Spring Day.  He sang "Freedom" by Rage Against the Machine, I do believe, but yall can correct me if I'm wrong.  Yes, most old people roll up their pants (trousers?  where are you from, England?)  I'm assuming this is for one of your plays, but I still feel kinda weird about this... Anyway, I'll be right back.  I'm going to go check out your website now that they've  finally  got it launched.  And Josh, I really do want a cd of your songs, I wasn't just kidding yesterday.

      Ok wait, did I miss something?  Josh what did you do great on?  Anyway, yeh, I was thinking about the Kyndall thing today, and she is pretty much the main reason that I am still at FRA.  If she and I were to, as you so elequently said it, Lindsey, "break up," I would have nothing left there, and would most likely go to BHS.  Just thought that you would like to know that, even though Kyndall and I are cool now.  Well, except for the fact that she couldn't go to the coffeehouse, and so I didn't go because I didn't want to be totally alone there.   Oh well.  I'm exausted anyway.  Just a quick question though...do old people roll their trousers up?  I need an answer, and then I'll explain. Also, I was designing a website for Habitat for Humanity of Williamson County.  I've finshed it now, and would appreciate it if you guys could check it out on your computers.  Please give me ANY feed back, no matter how harsh.  www.hfhwc.org   Thanks!   Two more days to see Fiddler.  Tell me if you want to go...in case its incentive, the most Christian guy I have ever met plays the Rabbi in it and he does a very cool dance.

      I'll try to go, but I probably don't have a ride (to the coffeehouse thingy.)  I probably can't go to fiddler tomorrow though becuase I've got tickets to 42nd street.  But I may come Sunday, because I really do want to see it.  I don't have any ice creams, so I guess we'll have to indulge in the Godiva.  Maybe before the coffehouse or something.  I don't know.  I have e-mailed Mr. Frag yet, but I will right now.  I'm just going to tell him that he should have listened to me, and that he's missing out on a great opportunity. Are you still kinda weireded out by the whole Travis/ T.J. thing?  Hope everything is going better with Kyndall.  If yall "break up", there's going to be practically no point in going to FRA next year...and there's all of us, and Travis at BHS... Hmm...  All right, I'm going to e-mail Travis now. Buh-Bye.

      Well, that's nice.  Well, I actually did go the play last night and it was really amusing.  It was good.  We need to go, either just me and you, Linds or as a big group with the other people on this blog...if they wanted too.  But no one has said they do...so....yup.  Me 'n' Kyndall had a fight yesterday, and I can't tell if everything is back to normal.  We haven't really gotten a chance to talk about it.  Boy, she really knows how to make people feel terrible though.   And the Travis thing.  Yeh...I don't know what I'm going to do about that.  I will call you when I get home this afternoon, but this evening  I am going to a "coffee house" at St. Philip's church in Downtown Franklin.  Anyone want to come?  I don't really know any of the details, but I will later.  I think.  Hummm..what  else is new?  I don't think so, at least in my life.  Won't be talking to Travis online this weekend....sigh...so sad...he's at his dad's house, which I should probably find out where it is.  How much you want to bet that he lives like right next door to me every other weekend, and I have no clue about it.  Actually that would be kinda weird...what if he knows and like, watches me?  Ok, now I'm just scaring myself.  Anyway...did you e-mail him?  Has anyone else talked to him? I'm sure he's  being pounded by everyone in the universe now.  Even my friends at school are like "where does he live?  We want to talk to him."  It's ok that you had to go last night, your mom sounded really mad.  How was your choir concert? Oh, wait you just said that it went well, never mind.  It's cool that you went out with your dad for dessert.  Did you get ice cream?  or are you saving up for the Godiva Belgian Dark Chocolate and Brownie Batter?   Um, does anyone what to come to the play Saturday at 7:00?  I might go, if anyone else wants to.  Tickets are $8, so I can pick some up, I just need to know how many.  What else is new in your lives?  Oh, if anyone wants to go the the Coffee House thing with me, just say the words.  The only person I will know there will be Carmen and she'll be waiteressing tables.  I don't want to go alone.  Do you know how pathetic that would look?

I'm not going (I'll explain later; it's spring day) because I need to know what's going on.  Choir concert went well.  I went out for dessert with my daddy afterwards.  I love him; he's really great to talk to.  I had a lot of fun with him.  He's really fun to be around when he's being nice.

Anyway, i need to modify the brownie recipe...it needs help.  Ummm...fragdaddy_t_liz@hotmail.com. i'm going to the play, i think tonight.  call me linds. we need to talk.

      Oh, yeah.  Before Abby I could cook scrambled eggs.  Now I can cook anything I want, with a recipe of course.  and then I can make up recipes, and modify them too.  BTW Abby, do I need to send in the Cooking Contest thing, or will you?  If I do, then I need the brownie recipe you made up.  Also, did we decide to do it in the desserts category?  I think we did, but just making sure.  Oh, and what's Travis's e-mail.  Something like iamfrag or something like that.  As for Travis and Gaddis, well...duh. Also, they kind of rhyme.

      Boys are stupid...no, he did not ask me out.  Go beat him up Linds.  Johnathon is going to talk to him too.  I got $2 in donations...Travis (well, duh) and Gaddis (another, well duh).  By the way, everyone, I taught Lindsey to cook, in case she forgot to mention that.

      I almost went tonight, but then I fell asleep on the couch.  Oh well.  Um, I donated like $10 already to the CF thing, but if anyone else was motivated by your inspiring speech, then by all means, give your money.  Um, yeah...I burnt my finger cooking a cold dish today.  I had to boil some water to liquify this gelatin stuff, and while I was putting the water on to boil, the guy standing next to me (who was doing nothing but getting in the way since I'm the only one in our group that knows how to cook) turned around and hit my arm right as I was putting down the pot.  Anyway, it had only been on for like a minute, but it was a gas burner, and it hurt.  A LOT.  And I didn't even cuss. (Not even a smurf, Abbs!)  And now they are having me do the poster that goes along with it, because apparently, I'm not busy, and because apparently I didn't do enough of the work yet.  What have the other people done?  Cliff bought orange juice, Meredith got pictures developed, and Ogetchi took pictures.  I'm definitely thinking this is even distribution of work.  But I had to do the poster, because 1) No one volunteered, except to volunteer me, and 2) If they did take it home against their wishes, then they either won't do it, or they'll do a seriously crappy job on purpose.  And that is how I got stuck with doing all the work.    So, did Travis ask you out yet, Abby?  If he didn't i'm going to really have to talk to him.    And, let's see, I've got that AP test to study for.  And the chemistry test.  And the Algebra test.  And the Spanish quiz... heeheehee...I'm going to di-ie.  Well, I betterquit procrastinating and actually start studying.  Hasta la vista, baby!

      Ahh, the wonderous joys of Wednesday night youth group. You know what I'm talking about Lindsey.  Well, I am really annoyed with Hotmail, because I can't check my e-mail.  According to the little men who control the internet, the server is too busy.  Yeh right, 4:45 on a Wednesday afternoon and the server is too busy.   So, my school service club is selling these Cystic Fybrosis things and I was wondering if any of you would like to buy one. You don't really get anything in return, you just get to give me money.  The upside is that they are only a buck, which isn't too bad.  If I sell 5, then I get to attend a pizza party, which isn't really that great because it will be Papa John's and I don't like their pizza.  So, actually, this is a really depressing way to sell something.  I don't get anything, you don't get anything...yup.  So, give me your money now that I've motivated you.  Well, I should go...church tonight!  Yay!

As for who is the minority...I'm not going to argue. But Latin and French  are  better. So I'll leave it to all of you to decide.  Chorus...BOO. Will...YAY. I don't have much time left, sorry.  Which is also why my "I'm just disappointed" post is not going to be in this one; but I  am  writing it down, and it  will  be great.  Thx for the "all of you are completely random", Abby. You should see us in person.  FREEEEDDOOMMMMMM, YEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHH. Just practicing all, don't mind me. Heh.

      Wow, I have to say that all of you are completely random.  Don't take me wrong, randomness is a very cool thing.  Anyway, Lindsey, if you want to come to the play, or anyone else for that matter, its at FRA, in the middle school, which is the first building you see at the main enterence.  It shows Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  The first three dates, the show time is at 7:00 PM, and Sunday is a matinee at 3:00.  So, if anyone wants to come, I don't know what date I'm going.  You guys can work that out and I'll get tickets and stuff.  Just tell me the date and I can do it.  Choir is a stupid thing.  I hate it.  I've never had good choir expiriences, which is why, Lindsey, I am not joining Sonshine.  And latin, well, I don't know much about it, so...yeh...well, I just got a Food Network Newsletter, so I'm going to be my incredibly geeky self and read it, and maybe save a few recipes. Oh and congrats Will, for placing 1st.

      I wasn't dissing Latin.  Great language. In fact, if you'll remember, I tried to take it, but the whole choir thing got in the way.  But yes, I am dissing choir.  It's the only reason I want this year to end.  Parts have been fun, but really, it's been a bit of a drag.

      Congrats, Will!  Great job.  Will was completely right about everything in his last post, so you are bad about dissing Latin AND choir in the span of what, three posts?  Grrrrr....anyway, I suppose I'll get over it.  Talk to you people later.  ~Z

      Will, I'm so proud.  No, really, I'm not being sarcastic, that is really great!  I told you he was smart, Abby.  So, um, that's really all I have to say, except that I hate choir, and I know Z is going to kill me for that, but that's how I feel.  I'm supposed to come home and take a nap everyday, but choir is definitely cutting in to that.  Oh, and the fact that we kind of got in a wreckish type thing today.  Since you're all dying of suspense, I'll tell you the story.  Lindsey Baylor, the girl that chauffers me back and forth from school, skipped 7th period today to go fill up with gas. On her way back into the parking lot, people were double parallel parked, and she thought she had enough room to get through, but unfortunately, she didn't.  Her rearview mirror smashed into her her passenger side window (where I would have been sitting, had I decided to skip with her) and the glass shattered all over, so we spent until almost 4:00 vacuuming out her car, and there are still glass shards in there (and embedded in my arms too, I might add) but it's better than it was. So, that is my only happy story for today.  Call if you want a sad one...heehee.  I don't have a sad one to give today.  Sorry. Oh, and for the people who know about the whole cousin (Megan) situation, she's probably back home now, but I can't be sure on that.  She added me to her buddy list, and since she didn't have a computer at her boyfriend's house, I'm assuming she's back home.  But you never can tell with her... My thought was that maybe she was at the library, but then it hit me.  This is Vinemont Alabama.  There ARE no libraries... So, I'm guessing she's home. TTFN (Ta-Ta For Now.) That's what my orthodontist tells me all the time.  He's so cute. (Like old man with baby-face cute, not like hot cute.)

      Rosie? Fluent? that's almost as good as Hoppy Easter everybunny, and seeing as, Latin is not dead, just immortal, which is a point for Z and I, plus latin has so many ways you can send people to heck I lost count. Additionally, we have to put up with Magistra Shinkarev and that should count for something.  Although there is a good song that goes something like "Latin is a dead language, dead as can be, first it killed the Romans, now its killing me", o yeah in case anyone cares i won the math contest today

      That's Will alright.  Clear, concise, and ever so sweet.  But Will, wouldn't Spanish be the second most popular language on here?  Cause 1) Rosie is practically fluent and 2) Latin is a dead language, sorry to say.  Don't get me on that one.  I'm just teasing.  Ahhh...well, I'm much better about the whole Michael thing.  Abby's got Godiva ice cream for me, so I've got to go eat it sometime this week.  It'd be awful to let it go to waste.  So don't be too mean to him anymore.  Josh, you can still "reason" with him if you're not too busy doing your usual nothing.  But, anyway...so, so-so, so-so-so. (Abby will get that one.)  Right. I'm getting off of here.  Choir at 5:30.  Yay.  You can see the excitement written on my face and the sarcasm dripping out of every word in this sentence.  OK, I'm out of here.

      Hi Abby, nice to meet you, just a few notes; My english teacher's name is Robichaud (pronounced ro-bo-bitch), I do not know the atomic mass of plutonium, spanish is in the minority on this blog (Z and I are Latin, Josh is french,Lindsey and Rosie are Spanish), and Rosie did spread pig guts all over me while I was breaking those ribs.

      Abby, i want to go see Fiddler.  It's like the best play in the world, except for Phantom.  And Les Mis.  Ok, so it's the thrid best, but that's ok.  Don't be too harsh on Michael.  It ended well.  At first it didn't, when I hung up on him, but then I IMed him, and things kind of straightened out a bit.  I'm much better now.  Done moping.  I finally got my 35 cards done in study hall, while the bell was ringing.  Anyway, I better keep going on this research project.  The more I read about Lennon, the more I love him.  I'm even starting to like Yoko, or at least understand the principle behind why he loved her.  I was flipping through stations while my mom was in the hospital and on the History channel was this documentary about famous murders, and that day it just happened to be Lennon, so I watched it. When I finished watching, I think I had gone through a box of tissues.  I never knew that I'd be that emotional about something that happened 23 years ago...hmmm...it's going to be hard to write about.

      Yo, Abby!  Glad to see you on the Blog.  Just wanted to tell folks that I am on the way to interesting revenge on the world's biggest asshole formerly known as Michael.  More info later, because I want to drag it out, and you can tell Abby if you want to, Linds, but I want to tell the gang in person.  ;)  Love you guys.    ~Z

      Don't worry Lindsey, when I'm done with Michael, he will be in pain, serious pain...of which some i have already told you.  Just remember that it's his deal now...and that I have that ice cream for you.  Of course, you can only have it if I'm allowed to have a couple of bites.    It's nice to know that I'm not the only person not in Spanish...if that makes any sense at all.  I used to live in Arizona, but that doesn't seem to help my Spanish speaking skills.  Oh well, whatever.  French would rule, if my teacher wasn't so annoying, mean and such a hard grader.  You know those people that ruin something for you, when you used to love it?  Well, that's him...totally killed french for me.  Luckily this is the last year that i have to speak to him!  Thank God!    Hey, if any of you are up to it, my school is putting on a production of Fiddler on the Roof.  A bunch of my friends from school are it, and so I'll be going quite a bit.  If  anyone wants to come with me and make fun of it, please feel free.  I can get more info for you later if you want to come...it should be good.

      Who, Michael or Josh?  Michael only torture.  I wouldn't want him to die a sissy death.  I want there to be PAIN so at least I get some satisfaction out of it.  Josh, well, I don't think I want him to die.  He was my best comforter today.  All that satire and irony really helps when I'm in a bad mood apparently.  I don't know, though.  Liz was really good about it too.  She gave me a hug when I really needed it.  Thanks, yall.  I know I was being a real witch today.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.  Depends on how things go tonight I guess.  I'll keep yall posted.

      Now now Lindsey...  Slightly psychotic? I'm surprised you'd refer to a friend like that. Everyone knows I'm a FULLY, 100% certified and registered psychotic. I just can't believe you'd undermine my position in life like that. God, I'm  weeping . Dear god, these wounds will never heal, it's time for me to die. Goodbye cold world.  Ok, so that was all BS, and now to the real, "j/k" version of me. Heya there Abby, me llamo Josh, and surprisingly, I'm not in Spanish, considering my vast vocabulary in that language...at least, my limited memory of the Taco Bell menu. Whatever.  Sarcasm is cool, it's good to have you here.

      It won't happen.  Anyway, hi guys.  Nice to meet you, in a way...yeh, I think that insanity is a normal, so no one should feel bad about what Lindsey said, or anything for that matter  (I still love you though!)  And by the way, everyone DOES love my sarcasm. Its a part of who I am, and if you can't accept that then, well, I don't really care.  I won't do anything about it anyway.

      Yes, Abby, everyone just loves your sarcasm.  Heehee.  anyway, since no one wants to introduce themselves, I'll semi-introduce them, and then if they want to correct me they can.  Unless they insult me, and then their post gets edited.  Ha ha.  That's what happens when I'm the administrator.  *maniacal laughter*  Anyway, you already know Elizabeth and you know of Michael, so I'll move on.  Josh is the...insane, maybe?...one.  He's a great guy.  Just slightly on the verge of insanity.  Just like Rosie, who is slightly psychotic. (are you seeing a pattern here?)  Let's see, I met her last year when she sat across from Liz and me when we were dissecting fetal pigs and she named hers after Will (her lab partner, who is also on here.)  Will knows everything.  I'm serious.  The Atomic mass of, I don't know, plutonium, right off the top of his head.  Seriously, he should be teaching Mr. Adams most days.  Probably Robashaud too.  Yeah, I just totally butchered her name, but I'm pretty sure Will doesn't mind this time.  You know Jackie and Brian too, but they never come on here, so that's ok.  Let's see, did I get everyone?  Oh, well, me.  Well, duh, you know me, otherwise you wouldn't be on here.  Oh, and everybody, this is Abby.  Um, like she said, she goes to my church, and FRA, but I'm trying to get her to come to BHS next year.  Who knows?  It just might happen.  Yeah, right.

      Yeh, Lindsey, stop with the jokes...you're really bad at them.  Just kidding...that was one of my wonderful jokes.  Well, ok, maybe nobody should make jokes like that.  They should seriously be banned.

      OK, I'm like, the in-between on this one.  I believe that we should be thankful for being able to talk about shallow things, instead of having to worry about sickness, or money, or food, or where we're going to sleep tonight.  But I also think that we should take advantage of the brain God gave us to use.  I heard a saying the other day.  It went something like "Small minds talk about people, Average minds talk about events, Intelligent minds talk about ideas."  Why are we focusing so much on the intricate details of this argument?  You're either friends, unconditionally (meaning you take the good with the bad), or you're not friends.  If you're friends, you should forgive each other and let that all be in the past, and then forget about it.  If you're not, it shouldn't matter what the other person thinks of you, and so you should, let's see...forget about it.  I mean, there's a choice there, but my opinion is that yall at least take a break from each other.  I think yall are spending so much time together that the bad stuff is far outwaying the good.  And there is lots of good in both of you.  But maybe yall just need to step away from each other for a bit, even if it is just to gain some perspective.  What I think I'm trying to say is that this has gone on long enough, and both of yall need to make a decision, stick to it, and then forget about it.  Well, not forget about it exactly, just don't bring up the issue.  And even if yall don't like each other or whatever, at least respect each other.  Ok, that was my diplomatic answer.  As I started writing this, my true feelings came out.  Above is what I thought I felt.  Below is what I really feel.    Disclaimer: The following are my true thoughts and feelings.  If you are easily offended, do not read this.  I can't help what I'm feeling.  None of you were there 9 or 10 years ago when all this was starting up.  None of you were there in 5th grade or in middle school when basically what is happening now was happening.  Do not yell at me for saying what I think, however, feel free to debate what I am saying with facts based upon experience.  Or feel free to support me.  Or just leave the whole issue alone.  Whatever.    If what rosie saying is true, and it probably is, the rest of us may very well take the same stance you are.  I've been thinking about that.  I mean, do we really want to be Becca's "fat friends."  I've known Becca a long time, and this just sounds like something she's say.  I think she might just hold herself in higher regard than the rest of the world.  It's just that I've been thinking latel about the past 9 years that we've known each other, and it always seems like the only time she wants to be friends is when she needs me to do or be something for her... I'm not trying to turn people against becca or anything, but I've known Becca to lie.  A lot.  And though I've known Rosie a shorter amount of time, she's always been really trustworthy.  And I especially back her on this one because I know how it is with Becca.  I've been through version of this fight many times before.  As I was writing this, I was kind of neutral on this thing but now I am getting more and more...I don't know, not upset really, just kind of...perturbed..  Anyway, though I probably shouldn't take sides, I really am.  I am siding with Rosie, and my full support is behind her.  It's not that I like her more than Becca (though right now I really do, but that's not the point) it's that she is right on a lot on things.  And I'm not advocating that anyone else take sides either because I don't want this little "group" thing to end, but I do think that this is one thing Rosie really is right on.  I don't know about you guys, but I don't want a friend who is going to ditch me at the first sign of popularity.  I don't want a friend who is always telling me I'm second best.  That's not a friend.  Josh says that friendship is unconditional, and I agree with that to a degree. But once a person starts acting like this, though, I don't think that person is your friend any longer.  Then they are just an acquatince, a classmate.  And if what Rosie says is true, and I believe it is, then Becca has just become a classmate.  And unconditional no longer applies.

      So, what if everyone went around every single day and completely ignored humanity?  I would like to tell you right now that some people find that there are problems in life.  There are stupid ones and there are not so stupid ones.  If everyone went around with their faces to the ground not looking at eachother, I can tell you right now that I would not be alive.  I am not trying to sound like a complete bitch or anything, but yes, most of the stuff written in this blog is incredible shallow.  But do you see how lucky you are to have shallow things to talk about?  For the past 2 years of my life I have been in and out of the hospital; recieveing drugs that would kill me if I had only a few grams more.  I would be terrified of someone coughing on me becuase I literally had no immune system to protect me against a simple cold.  I had cancer and everyday I had to deal with it.  The only thing that I wanted was to be normal.  To talk about boys and parties and parents.  I wanted to be a normal teenager, to be treated like a normal teenager.  There were people younger and sicker than me, who I never saw complain about any of the things that were happening to their body.  Yes, we are going to roll over and die someday.  Have you just come to that realization?  I almost died twice.  People make mistakes, several times.  But that doesn't mean they just stop "living."  They go on, they move on, I go on, I move on.  Why don't you keep on living like that?  I hope that you guys don't have to know what it is like to have the incredible desire to be accepted, to be normal, to be shallow.  I know.  And I can tell you that it is one of the worst feelings in the world.  That is why my life is not a waste.  It will never be a waste, because I know what I am supposed to do with it.  I know my purpose.  I hope that you find your life to have meaning.  I'm sorry, but I can't just sit here reading your complaints about how pointless the world is.  I could get REALLY Christian on you, but I won't.  I know that this is probably upsetting you, Josh, that I disagree with you so strongly and I'm sorry, but thats my opinion and it will never change.  I also know that this entire entry is stupid becuase I don't go to your school and deal with the same things, but I hate it when people give up.  I would not be here if I had.  Yes, there is one more person with hope for humanity and that person is me.

      Well, I'm glad everyone is having such a good day.  I managed to get to a computer this weekend; here I am at the library, the "library closing" warning is blaring every five minutes now, and I'm siting here shaking and trying to figure out what the hell I wanted to say.  You guys don't know how hard this is. It smells like Leigh Anne in here. I kissed her at this exact spot once, the very place I'm at right now.  I came home angry yesterday. I did it because I realize how much humanity is lost to itself. Take a look around you, everyone! What is the goddamned point? Perhaps nihil is right. So I'm going to go out on a wing and make a new form of philosophy: nihilistic socialism, and the theory is that everything will end in nihilism.  This morning I had something to say, and I still know what I wanted to say. I wrote it on a piece of paper when I woke up this morning because I had a dream about it, something that might just change us all into that thing we're all looking for; but I left the paper in the car on the way in. I really don't see a point in sharing it.  It's because humanity is a fucking waste.  We've just been missing it all along. Why should we settle things peacefully? Why have a friend when we could have a hated enemy? Why be constant allies with someone when we could shift our alliances at the drop of a hat? Why not let our demons eat us?  WHY SHOULDN'T WE LET THEM EAT US? It's alright, because they've been eating us all along! Consuming and digesting us, taking our innards and spreading them in a sick ritual of their victory. They got us, gang. Too fucking bad.  But it's alright, because somehow we'll get back up again, just like we always do. And then we're going to get into another shithole and the process of masochism is going to start all over again; just like we promised we would never again. I said I would never get into another Megan Flynn situation again: look what happened.  What I'm trying to say, all, is that I've achieved some kind of dark enlightenment.  Humanity is a waste. I am a waste, you are a waste, and all of us and everything about us is a waste.  Proof? Read this BLog cover to cover. Read MY BLog, cover to cover. What's the point, gang? We're all just going to roll over and die anyway, we're good at that.  I've tried to keep face-up this year, I really have. When what I called kindness was called "being a pushover", I shrugged it off. When you fought I tried to mediate it. I tried not to get angry. Look what it produced. More hatred, hate hate hate hate hate hate.  And yes, I have lost faith in even myself. I can't trust myself to not be jealous or upset. I can't trust myself to be a rock when I'm all alone and the only consolation I have is my shaking concious.   I hope you all get something out of this; let's just die because there isn't really a point to it. Some of you saw me upset for the first time on Friday, when I went off at Rosie and Becca. That was the last bit of determination I had to try and give all of you that enlightenment I tried to have. It was hope in humanity; and maybe I was the last person left with any real hope that something would turn out right.  They're kicking me out now. I'm not sure if I made the best sense but there's a lot to get out of this, if you can. This has been the hardest thing I've had to write in a long time.  It's all a fucking waste. Happy Birthday Will, have a great day.

      Will....Happy Birthday..... I'm only 12hours later than Linds and Abby........hehe. oops. Y didn't you tell us it was your B-day? Well... try to have a good one and if not.....I'll try to make it on the 17th wish YOU and better one.........What do you want...I have to go get Erika and Amanda something...so you might as well telll me since I'm not really good at guy presents...unless you really want a dress for you birthday.....that reminds me I HAVE to get that picture developed.....O:-)  Hey...anyone going to see Becky this weekend? How is she? Ready for a beheading? I'm not mad I promise.....Ok so I am. I'm just so sick of being the worst friend to her. The friend that steals all her other friends, the friend that is "jealous" of her boyfriend, the friend that sneaks behind her back......Ok that isn't me. I'm just so sick of that running through her head. What heck....maybe becuase we have common friends she thinks I'm stealing them....maybe though there is a reason......just maybe. Bet the second one. WTF. How in the world can i be jealous of some one I don't know. You all know that used to hold one guy above the rest (no groans please) and I doubt I would just settle to have a boyfriend like Becky so I don't know where that curve ball came from. Then about sneaking behind her back....of course I did. At that time I trusted Philip more. He's the kind of person that wouldn't give a crap about if so and so liked him unless he liked them back. He wouldn't treat them any differently.....and I also knew that he's shy of the girls he really likes so...if he had really liked Becky then by me telling him...he would have made his move. Unfortunately he didn't like her and they still remained friends....oh wait I stole him from her....nevermind that I knew him first. Bleh....and eventually I did tell her....thanks Linds. Then the Pechenko thing....ok whatever Becky, you already tired me out with the like love or I hate Phil routine so whatever you want to do. Then you pop Michael on me.....um ok good luck i hope you two fare well. Twoo weeks later, Rosie!! I hate him. He's to clingy...he worships me too much......um....ok then tell him to not worship me...but I don't know what to do.....Well then, just tell micheal what you want.....i don't know how....@.@ do you mind if I do then since i don't want to hear about this anymore...ok, finally i don't care if you talk to my boyfriend....um ok... BLAH I WANT TO TEAR HER APART. Now she blames me for tearing her and micheal apart.......bleh....when she got back together with him i told her to make sure that she wanted michael not just a boyfriend...and she said ok. So well hoped they had good luck. then a week later she says she hates his guts.......@.@ again....well tough it out...do what you want to...... And now it's my fault she broke up with the boyfriend she hates....but wait she didn't tell me her TRUE feelings about him....so she's been lying to me............so it's between bad and worse.......And the problem isn't that....it's that she doesn't know how the hell to treat her true friends.....sorry becca but almost every senior hates you. Erika thinks you're annoying. pedchenko (junior) thinks that you are a annoying and needs to grow up. Matt thinks you're melodramatic. CrazyChicken thinks that you're annoying.......um....yeah.....he really does but you aren't stupid so he puts up with you...i got that out of matt......really becca... think about it...all the whining you do and all the dramatics really don't get you anywhere with them....really...try acting like you can talk without whining.....yes i do whine but I do know when to stop and it's never about the SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER....it adds variety....you on the other hand......it's calculus this caluculus that....do I need to remind you that you CHOSE to take that class........really you did... i'm not joking. Plus all that work you out into it....guess what, NO ONE DOES THAT MUCH AND THEY STILL GET AS MUCH OR BETTER THAN YOU........really... calculus should be a major part but not til 12am every night...you're going to kill yourself. Really....oh and learn to use your brain as you use your mouth...you NEVER tell your friends that as soon as you've lost the weight you're going to switch over to the popular group. DON'T BLAME YOUR DESIRE TO BE ACCEPTED ON OUR FAULTY TREATMENT OF YOU.....we treat you as one of us....really we do....and ravenwood....go join them ....really please do....you can go take my spot so that way you can have friends that accept you.....but let me tell you.....that opening door thing, and the rapt attention will fade....sorry that we can't worship you like they do.........once you said that I was your best girlfriend.....after philip and pedchenko...sorry to bust your bubble but you've been getting on phil's nerves for the past 2 months and pedchenko....did he ever really like you...(hint: he doesn't say you're annoying because he's flirting with you, I promise) and ...well with me you're on the bottom of the list since Xi is starting to realize what that we're both wrong...I'm not saying that I've done everything right but I have been trying to tell the truth and be a friend.......how ofter have you mislead me......remember when you said that you wanted to build a sister relationship with me since your real sister was such a dud.....sorry not happening......we can't... we're TOO different. I have a balance that I'm happy with . I have my education and I have my friends....true some are the nicest but guess what...they actually care and if they have a problem they let you know. I've been dropping hints that maybe you might want adjust somethings that you do......honestly with no bias in this statement.....very few people can really like for long periods of time. You're loyal and have many great qualities but some of the awful ones are well......i just can't stand them.........really.......

      Oh, my god.  I am so sorry.  Don't ever hesitate to use the blog to rant.  It sounds like you needed it.  Badly.  I don't know what to say, but I am saying that your birthday is going to be celebrated at the party on the 17, and people, get the boy some decent presents.  What do you really want, Will?  It sounds like you've never had a really good birthday, and you are talking to the queen of birthdays.  I love them, whether they be mine or someone else's.  It doesn't matter.  Get a list together of people you want to invite.  I know a gourmet chef (namely Abby) that can cook ANYTHING you want, and it will be really good...wait, make that REALLY GOOD!!!!   Anyway, tell me what you want to eat, who to invite, what you want to do...This is going to be a party to remember!!!    If you need to talk, I'm here.  Don't ever hesitate to call or talk to me at any time.  I'm pretty sure I speak for everyone on this blog when I say that.  I know I speak for Abby because she's sitting right beside me, and agrees with me.    And most importantly, let me and Abby be the first to wish you (and I know we are because it's 1:32 am) "HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY, WILL WHITESIDE!!!!!!!!!!"

      If you don't like obsecenities DON'T read this. This week started off pretty good.  Block schedule, all my evil classes are split up and euro every day, my birthday is at the end of the week, i'm turning 16, we're going to pepo de buco (or whatever that new restaurant is), and X2 on saturday. sounds like fun. then I get into Robobitch's class and find out that the defense is not allowed to make a case because Mike has a clue and Mrs. Bitch's hand picked prosecution is worthless and incopetent.  ok im not going to let that get to me, then shinkarev for an hour and a half, fine its ok, still not mad.  Before I go further I need to describe the birthday situation for the last few years.  On my birthday we lose the soccer game sptaculary(don't fucking care about spelling), Im wished happy birthday only by aunts(except for the last 5 minutes before I go to bed then my parents finally remember), it always ends up that I get mocked by walt then one of my parents while the other one is yelling at me,and then Walt gets his presents before I do (his birthday is june 1 mine is may 3). and we have wretched ice cream cake.  ok having said that im going to go up the list, I'm going to go get my cake tomorrow(not one of the ice cream cakes that my parents are going to insist on) I got a twenty dollar stove a couple of months ago but the one thing I want is denied because walt is grounded and Once he gets ungrounded hewill refuse to play it with me because hes a whiny bitch.  one aunt has wished me happy birthday . . . i think. Ive already gotten mocked twice by my dad and walt and my birthday's not till tomorrow.  heres where it gets different instead of losing one fucking game this year I get to lose two and then get mocked by walt because he has a good team surrounding him and they win.  I need to start having birthday parties again, away from my family, maybe then people won't spend their time laughing at me.  by the way if I throw a birthday party, I don;t get to plan it or even get to chose who i invite( the list made out by my mom would include my best friend from elementary school who now spends his time making cracks about me, a boy I have'nt seen in years, and all of their friends, fun , fun, for everyone but me), and if by some miracle i do manage to get some people on the list that iv spoken to in the last year, they would have fun talking about the goings on at BA and then  a refreshing game of pin the tail on the donkey or some other nonsense like that.    sorry, lindsey for using your blog as a place to rant but im afraid if i didn't i might explode.  im also sorry to anyone who ive offended . . . o wait if ive offended you than either you don't like obsenities (which i do apologize for) or you are one of the ones at who manages to make my birthday the Hell on earth every time (in which i don't give a fucking rat's ass)  My dad just came over and told me to get a picture of me in a fucking indian costume rotated 90 degrees. yay fun!

      sorry this is sort of off topic  Why do parents think that only kids are "addicted" to computer games.  My mom just cited an article that said that "kids who spend more that 4 hours a week on a computer have lower grades and are more likely to get addicted to 'IT'"  my mom spends more than 50 hours a week on the computer, not working, but playing mindless games.  What's the difference? Why is her spending more hours on the computer than i do at school not as bad as me getting on the computer just long enough to check my E-mail and type this up.  I do this 7 times a week.  Does that mean im addicted?  I spend maybe 7 hours a week on the computer and 7 hours a day at school.  Where do my priorities lie?  She spends 50 hours a week on this very computer im sitting at right now playing mindless games such as Destruct-o-match.  I spend 7 hours comunicating.  Hold on a second, does this seem just a little bit hypocritical?  O wait, I forgot, no one is grading her on anything.  Let's hypothesize what her grade would be like if she was being graded right now...she would be in the 65-68 range, and she complains about me getting a 91???  Additionally time how long you spend on the computer just for the purposes of communication (E-mail, this, etc.).  You probably will be over 4 hours for the week.  That means that the second part of the study cited above is useless.  The only thing it says is that if you have a computer, you are more likely to get "addicted" to it. Sorry for my little rant, but I had to get that out

      Ok, pagans are like people who worship the devil, but Josh was wrong on his source.  The "3-fold Rule" is only applied to Wiccans, which is a relatively new religion, that worships a God and/or a Goddess (long story about the and/or part) and they believe that if someone does something bad, it comes bad times three.  Kind of like karma.  It really has nothing to do with different schools.  You're just sheltered!  But on to Michael.  Yeah, I knew about Erin, too.  I had the EXACT same reaction you did.  I was like, Oh...I'm so sorry (Josh was there.  He knows that's what I really did!)  But inside, I was like hahahahahahaha!!!! which of course, I posted on the blog.  Just to save Abby the time, I'm not going to say come to BHS because we already know where that's going to lead...

      Yeh..so, anyway...Michael told me about him and erin, then he was like, "i bet your happy now aren't you?" and i was like "oh, no...i'm so sorry." but inside i was screaming and laughing SOOOOO hard.  well, yeh he deserves it.  and i kinda like the fact that he read the letter and was surprised by it.  most of my friends at school don't believe me when i told them that i cussed...mulitple times.  you know what i'm talking about linds.  they think that they've corrupted me... hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  they only wish.  by the way, not to sound completely blonde or anything, but what in the world are you talking about?  pagans?  why are the pagans right?  who are the pagans?  one of the many dissadvantages to going to a different school.  this is where lindsey types "so come to bhs!" and then i respond "umm...no, sorry, but not going to happen."  and she says "but why?  i'm here , travis here...come here" and i say "i don't know.  i can't explain it.  i just cannot go there." and then everyone else, in unison, goes "awwww...." at least i hope so...please.   anyway, the bell is about to ring, so i'll talk to you guys later!  peace out and bya!

      Well the pagans had it right then...at least to a third of an extent: what you put in gets you back thrice over.  This should be pretty interesting, I think I'm going to take a backseat and watch it all play out.  Of course, there might be some third-party interference here and there...........................  Not on my part, of course.  Of course.

I hate how paper just throws itself away so often.  That used to happen to my homework all the time!  I told him I was sorry that Erin broke up with him, but inside I'm like Mwuhahahahahaha!!!!  I hate that I'm so vindictive. Well, nothing can be done about it... Oh, well.  I'm over it.  Go figure...

      Here's an e-mail from Michael.  Hahahahahahahaha!!!!   Sucker.    Hey  This should make your day, Erin broke up with me Monday.  She said, "I just don't think I'm ready for a boyfriend."  Which directly contradicts anything she has ever said to me.  She said too that if it was ok with me we could still be friends and all.  I said that was fine, the next morning I went over to her locker to talk to her.  I said hi, she mumbled something, slammed her locker, and ran off.  I was somewhat confused by this, after all, we were still supposed to be friends.  Later that morning, her and a group of her friends were talking (they were actually mutual friends, I didn't just walk over there) so I walked over and I kid you not five seconds later she looks over, gets this look on her face and runs in the other direction.  So, who knows.  I evidently suceeded in pissing her off last night at a track meet by hitting on another girl.  Whatever...  So that pretty much sums it up, she contradicts herself, and runs from her problems.  So that should give you a little bit of vindication or whatever.  Oh, I read Abby's email.  Damn.  I am afraid to open Z's though.  What do you think?  Michael

      No more reproductive organs, that I promise.  At least from me anyway.  I was just trying to get people to react so they would at least, you know, post once in a while.  It gets boring around here with just me and Abby.  But I think my Dante thing got that taken care of.  Go take the test.  I want to see where yall end up, especially Abby.  Anyway, I've got to go help my mom take a shower.  If anyone wants to come to my little sister's play, it's today at 6:00 at Brentwood UMC in the sanctuary.  It's about Jonah, and Whitty has a solo, so come see her!!!  She's really good.  Ok, that's it for me.  Bye-bye for now.

      Well, just finished reading the whole hell thing, and the computer didn't die.  Where'd you get this? It'd be awesome to take vacations in hell. "Visit the frozen depths of Cocytus, see the Eternal Freeze TODAY!" Have a picnic amidst the Fields of Purgation, what a lovely time.  I can help you with those links later if you would like. As to everyone elses' posts...this thing has one percent battery left, so I'll have to read these later.  Woo.

      Like you...heehee.  Well, at least he's not telling you what type of underwear he's wearing anymore.    Ok, I went to this site with linkage to a site with linkage to another site that had this really cool test about what level of hell you would be in, so of course, I had to take it.    It's supposedly taken directly from Dante's booky thing.  I thought it was pretty cool.  Here are my results, and the thingy that explains the results.  The bold one is the place I'd actually be, and the italicized ones are the ones that I got a highish score on.  The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to Purgatory!  Here is how you matched up against all the levels: Level | Score Purgatory | High Level 1 - Limbo | Low Level 2 | Low Level 3 | Low Level 4 | Moderate Level 5 | Very Low Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very Low Level 7 | Low Level 8- the Malebolge | Moderate Level 9 - Cocytus | Very Low   urlLink Level descriptions   urlLink Take the test  (Go take it!!!)    And here's what it means:   Purgatory You have escaped damnation and made it to Purgatory, a place where the dew of repentance washes off the stain of sin and girds the spirit with humility. Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.  (This is me) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 1 - Limbo Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 2 You have come to a place mute of all light, where the wind bellows as the sea does in a tempest. This is the realm where the lustful spend eternity. Here, sinners are blown around endlessly by the unforgiving winds of unquenchable desire as punishment for their transgressions. The infernal hurricane that never rests hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine, whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them. You have betrayed reason at the behest of your appetite for pleasure, and so here you are doomed to remain. Cleopatra and Helen of Troy are two that share in your fate. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 3 In the third circle, you find yourself amidst eternal rain, maledict, cold, and heavy. The gluttons are punished here, lying in the filthy mixture of shadows and of putrid water. Because you consumed in excess, you meet your fate beneath the cold, dirty rain, amidst the other souls that there lay unhappily in the stinking mud. Cerebus, a canine monster cruel and uncouth with his three heads and red eyes, dwells in this level. He growls and tears at the damned with his teeth and claws. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 4  Just before the river Styx is the Fourth Level of Hell. Here, the prodigal and the avaricious suffer their punishment, as they roll weights back and forth against one another. You will share eternal damnation with others who either wasted and lived greedily and insatiably, or who stockpiled their fortunes, hoarding everything and sharing nothing. Plutus, the wolf-like demon of wealth, dwells here.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 5 The river Styx runs through this level of Hell, and in it are punished the wrathful and the gloomy. The former are forever lashing out at each other in anger, furious and naked, tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth. The latter are gurgling in the black mud, slothful and sullen, withdrawn from the world. Their lamentations bubble to the surface as they try to repeat a doleful hymn, though with unbroken words they cannot say it. Because you lived a cruel, vindictive and hateful life, you meet your fate in the Styx. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 6 - The City of Dis You approach Satan's wretched city where you behold a wide plain surrounded by iron walls. Before you are fields full of distress and torment terrible. Burning tombs are littered about the landscape. Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 7 Guarded by the Minotaur, who snarls in fury, and encircled within the river Phlegethon, filled with boiling blood, is the Seventh Level of Hell. The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment. The stench here is overpowering. This level is also home to the wood of the suicides- stunted and gnarled trees with twisting branches and poisoned fruit. At the time of final judgement, their bodies will hang from their branches. In those branches the Harpies, foul birdlike creatures with human faces, make their nests. Beyond the wood is scorching sand where those who committed violence against God and nature are showered with flakes of fire that rain down against their naked bodies. Blasphemers and sodomites writhe in pain, their tongues more loosed to lamentation, and out of their eyes gushes forth their woe. Usurers, who followed neither nature nor art, also share company in the Seventh Level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 8- the Malebolge  Many and varied sinners suffer eternally in the multi-leveled Malebolge, an ampitheatre-shapped pit of despair Wholly of stone and of an iron colour: Those guilty of fraudulence and malice; the seducers and pimps, who are whipped by horned demons; the hypocrites, who struggle to walk in lead-lined cloaks; the barraters, who are ducked in boiling pitch by demons known as the Malebranche. The simonists, wedged into stone holes, and whose feet are licked by flames, kick and writhe desperately. The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves. Some wallow in human excrement. Serpents writhe and wrap around men, sometimes fusing into each other. Bodies are torn apart. When you arrive, you will want to put your hands over your ears because of the lamentations of the sinners here, who are afflicted with scabs like leprosy, and lay sick on the ground, furiously scratching their skin off with their nails. Indeed, justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.  (i don't really know why I got this one...I'm not a whore or a theif.  I think it may be the whole malice bit.) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 9 - Cocytus This is the deepest level of hell, where the fallen angel Satan himself resides. His wings flap eternally, producing chilling cold winds that freeze the thick ice found in Cocytus. The three faces of Satan, black, red, and yellow, can be seen with mouths gushing bloody foam and eyes forever weeping, as they chew on the three traitors, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. This place is furthest removed from the source of all light and warmth. Sinners here are frozen deep in the ice, faces out, eyes and mouths frozen shut. Traitors against God, country, family, and benefactors lament their sins in this frigid pit of despair.

      Sorry Lindsey about the genetalia thing....after hearing Riley should " I have the genetalia to back  that up" (back up the fact that he's male)....you just well don't react to that word after seeing Riley moving and shouting that word.....*throwing up* ok not really (abby: He's our chemistry teacher that is, to put it nicely, HUGE...think table) and for the 7th comandment...i have this cute finger thing that tells me the commandments in order so...yeah i know all of them...just one of the random things that suck to me. Alex helped philip... Philip did it out for teasing fun (*i think* becuase he told me that I shouldn't be mad...and that he didn't hate me, anyway) but alex honestly hates me. yeah...guys are jerks.  Um abby's friend....prolly but i won't see him much unless he's insanely glued to AP courses.

And the commandment thing, I obviously knew it was a commandment, but I didn't know it was the 7th.  Sorry to burst your bubble Lindsey.  Guys are jerks.  I agree.  AHHH!!!  I have terrible news!  One of my favorite guy friends is being kicked out of FRA!!!!  I'm so bummed.  I'm going to try to convince him to go to BHS.  He's very cool.

      Cute Will, on both accounts.  Rosie, no one is supposed to know that "Thou Shalt Not Kill" is th 7th commandment.  You're just not supposed to.  It's almost freakish.  The only other person on the face of this earth who might actually no that would be Abby...like I said, almost freakish.  (Just kidding.  I luv ya!)  Rosie, don't kill Phillip.  Then you'd have all those legal complications and such, and I don't think we're prepared to handle that right now.  Maybe senior year.  And what did Alex do???  When you post stuff, you're supposed to give background info.  And no one was apalled by "genatalia!"  I'm upset!  *Sigh.* I'm going to go watch Oprah.

He should be glad that the 7th commandment is thous shalt not kill and that I didn't have a loaded gun with me. BTW, Josh if Alex does that again...he's in the same pit with Philip. Guys are jerks. They don't know when to stop. Really, when Rosie looks like she's going to kill you....it's time to stop.

      In response to Lindsey's request, I am posting an article from a recent chemical journal.  New Chemical Element Discovered   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by investigators at a major U.S. research university. The element,  tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have one neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistant vice neutrons,which gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called morons.  Since it has no electrons, administratium is inert. However, it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally occurred in less than a second.  Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at which time it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that the atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.  Research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations, and universities. It can usually be found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.  Scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.

      Mwuhahahaha!!!!  The score is 3-0...Mwuhahahaha!!!  Abby, you know you're not supposed to kill people without me there to supervise and hold their hands behind their backs.  Anyway, Tony, Lindsey Baylor's boxer, came over and played with Brandy and Maddie today.  They were sooo cute.  Well, Tony and Maddie were, Brandy just kind of slept.  Hey, she's old.  She can't help it.   And, um, oh yes... I have *drum roll* ALL of my make-up work finished.  Done.  Complete.  I did 9 weeks worth of work in a little less than 3 weeks, which just goes to show that we are wasting precious time in school.  Hmmm, what else?  I've got say something because my blog is really getting boring.  How about this, I'll just tell yall what we (Josh, Liz, and Me, and Will, some of the time) were talking about in fifth today.  Josh was talking his dad watching Star Trek obsessively and how he would have to say something really weird to get his attention, like "Dad, I've hurt my genatalia!" (yes, I probably didn't spell that right, but in my defense, it is only due to a lack of practice) at which point I start cracking up, wondering, why not arm instead, but he wanted it to be outrageous.  Anyway, so from there we go on to talking about peeing on electric fences and from there to people doing odd things with their "genatalia" while they are drunk, namely putting it down fire ant hills, which is probably not a very smart thing to do, even for a drunk person.  So, there is my story to try to spice up the blog once more since no one is having any more crises at the moment, except for my little phone "competition."  So, post back, hopefully not about genatalia, because I think we've had enough of that in this post, but about something else, perhaps even more disturbing or interesting, or conversation startering, or something like that.  I gotta go before I make an even bigger fool out of myself, which I'm not quite sure is possible.  Anyway, I'll see yall later.  Oh, and also, I have not have ANY caffeine today, so this is ALL natural, which is kind of scary, too.

      Ummm...ok, I'll try to call Lindsey...when did this competition start anyway?  And when am I not right?  I heard about the mosh pit, I think it was Romeo who tried to push that happy teacher dude in.  He said something along those lines during "Sunday School."  I'm off to find a way to kill Deech.  Peace out  or bya.

      People,I have a grave crisis that needs attending to.  Lindsey is currently losing a competition with her little sister to see who can get the most phone calls.  Ergo I need everyone to call Lindsey as often as you are able to come up with reasons for doing so.  I thank you beforehand for your assistance in this grave matter.

      Heheh, as to the end of Lindsey's post: it's interesting what we get in the middle of at the most inopportune times.  Spring Day was amazing. God, how fun. I have to do it again; but next year it'll be even heavier :) Not too sure of the songs yet, but you can bet we'll probably die of cardiac arrest onstage next year. As for shock value, ask Z...I heard they tried to get Keidel in the mosh pit, and one guy said it was the first time he'd ever seen Keidel frown. I was stunned. It was kinda depressing seeing the pit going really strong for a few minutes, and looking up two minutes later to find it gone. But the ending was great, even I thought it was pretty damned good.  And more details today in fifth period, of course :)

      Yeah, well, you know.  Just don't finish it... No, just kidding.  If you can take the gay sex, you can take the end.  And Abby, didn't you know that deech has  always  been pure enough to be God's spokesperson?  You're right about Wynn though.  At first I thought it was just that he didn't like me anymore, but apparently other people are noticing it too.  My mom thinks maybe he's losing his job.  I don't know though, that seems like something Wynn would take in stride and tell our group "this is something we can learn from.  God takes care of all of us." but he's not.  Something is definitely up, though.  Well, 42nd Street was really good, but I almost fell asleep during intermission.  My mom was like, "well, that just shows you're not back to 100% yet."  I was like, sure mom.  But then I didn't have to go to church and I got to sleep late, so hey, I wasn't too upset.  And you're right about no one responding (you're just right about everything tonight!) ever since you came.  People are forgetting about me. *sob*  Actually, Josh doesn't always have a computer...but everyone else does, though.  Oh, well.  Not that big of a deal.  People get to it when they can.  Oh, and Rosie, what was up with your mom when i called today?  I said "Hello, is rosie there?"  And she goes "Rosie not available" and I heard you go, "But, mom!" And she goes "No, not available" and hangs up on me.  It was kind of amusing with the accent, but it kind of worried me, but apparently you aren't grounded, or you're going all "Lindsey" on me.  Anyway, I'll see yall tomorrow except for Abby, who I'll talk to tomorrow.  Bya.  (Ha.  Beat you to it, Abby! [She made that up])

      Where were you this morning?  It was really interesting.  We got kinda loud, and Deech walked in and gave us this really evil stare.  We apologized afterwards, but he was like "yeh, ok.  fine.  whatever.  God forgives you." He wouldn't let me explain.  Whatever.  I don't like him anyway, and now I'm even more on his bad side.  Wahoo.  Deech has issues that he needs to work out.  By the way, how was I sinning by being loud and how does he know that God forgave me?  When has he become so pure that he is God's spokesperson?  I don't get it.  I don't want to go to small groups.  Its really becoming boring and bad.  I don't really like Wynn anymore.  He's kinda a jerk.  But I have to go to tell Gaddis that I don't need his help with the canned food drive, because no one brought cans.  Well, how was 42nd Street?  And why isn't anyone else responding to these?  Right now it seems like I'm just having a really long drawn out conversation with Lindsey.  Whatever.  Peace out

      Oh oh oh!  I could go plan the Sunday School lesson for tomorrow, and I could frost the cupcakes!   YES!  Something else to do other than math!  My life is complete!  I sing to the heavens!  And now you're thinking that I am totally insane.  I am, I won't deny it.  But when you have to do a power point for math, then anything will make you happy.  And I guess I still am a geek.  I don't think that I ever grew out of it.

      Ok, yes.  I know that I am majorly procrastinating on my power point. This is the third time I've checked the blog.  I went to Target earlier, and then People came in the mail, so of course, I HAD to read it.  I mean, Matt Leblanc was on the cover.  It was too good to miss. And I remembered my Chem homework and that requires research, and so I should do it, that's only right.  And...um...yeh....I can't think of anything else that I can do.  Someone, help me, please!!!  Bummer about your computer, Will.  That sucks.  I would respond to other people's entries, but there are none.  Hummm...ok, fine.  I will go do my stupid math project, but I'm not going to be happy.  (Now is the time where I start cussing...in my mind, don't worry Linds).

      A power point for math??? ok whatever, I owned the mutiple choice but sucked on the rest of it  now, gather round and you will hear a tale of fear once there was a young CPU, and he was always picked on by the keyboard, it kept getting overloaded by the teasing of the keyboard,  one day it decided it would get back at the keyboard, so it sent a nice little pulse of energy at it,  but, beiing a young computer, it sent the attack down the wrong cable, the poor little mouse had no chance,  then it straightened up and sent another attack at the keyboard,  the keyboard met this attack with its own,  the two duked it out for days, eventully the Keyboard won,  and that is why im writing this on a 90 mhz computer with a 14.4 modem

      Anyone who wants cupcakes gets to come to church on Sunday.  Otherwise they will be gone forever...of course its not like I'm never going to bake cupcakes ever again in my life. (By the way, I took some to Crockett park for my school friends and they got very good reviews.)   Anyway, I hate math.  Please shoot me so that I don't have to do my stupid power point project on math.  I hate it and I don't think that I could be more sarcastic on what I'm writing in it.  It's way to amusing.

This is going to be a great week. I opened a fortune cookie and it said "Everything will be coming your way" this morning. To what extent?  I need a vacation.

      How were the AP tests?  I"m sure you guys did fine. Crockett park is a fun place, but don't go wading in the water. I've been thinking about this whole situation between you guys, and I think that I agree, to a certain amout, with Josh. But, remember, I have really no clue what you guys are fighting about, and am not involved at all.  I just bake the cupcakes of which there are fewer. Call me please, Linds, or someone who knows the Travis situation.  I just need someone whose good at giving advice.

      first of all I want everyone to take a deep breath,  you will do great on this, I promise, now relax, and plan what you are going to do once you get the score and you get a 5.  then start panicing  because its only 3 hours away.

      Oooh, cupcakes!  I want cupcakes...*sniff*  I didn't know until this afternoon that this was off, so...I'm sorry that all of this has fallen on you, Josh.  I would do it for you but things would probably turn out worse because of my mouth/temper and then where would we be?  Linds, will you bring me some cupcakes if you can?  I want some.  Having to do with the e-mail, I couldn't possibly care less.  If I get one, I'll either immediately delete it or read it, get pissed, delete it, and have fun planning retribution.  Sigh.  Anyway, divorce update, in case anyone gives a shit.  My dad wanted to turn our dinner tomorrow night into a "Z-sleeps-over-at-Dad's-new-place" night, which I am SOOOO not ready for.  So I basically told him to forget it.  So now he's all down in the mouth.  Mom says it's because he doesn't see me every day anymore, to which I responded, "That was his choice, and now it's his problem."  So, Tao-Tao, if you say, "Smile, life is great" before next August, you will most likely end up in my basement on my rack.  ;)  Because trust me...life sucks.  And then you die.  My old and new philosophy.  Yeah.  Stressing slightly about the big AP test.  Plus it's late and I'm tired and pissed.  So I guess I don't mean some of that.   But I am still mad at my dad and will probably be so for a LOOOOONG time to come.  Would you guys just bear with me?  I really need your support.  Valete.  (Goodbye)  ~Z

      Um, well, I baked a whole BUNCH of cupcakes before I knew the thing was cancelled.  So, um, yeh.  No one in my family is going to eat them.  If people still want cupcakes, they are up for grabs.  My house is still open, by the way, so whenever you need to work this thing out, just come on over.

      Ok, yall, the Saturday thingy is off, considering no one can come except for me and Abby, which is entirely pointless,considering Abby and I get along perfectly well.  Apparently what we've decided is that Josh will talk to Becca privately on Monday, and that will be that.  Everyone agree? Good.  On to the next subject, whatever that may be.

      Wherever anyone stands, my house (and cupcakes) are still open, so yeh....get directions from Lindsey because she knows where you live and she knows where I live.  Well, if you are just sitting back during this whole ordeal thing, Josh, and I have absolutely no involvement in it, except for the location of the war, you and I will have lots of fun.  I'll make a few extra cupcakes and maybe some of the "modified" brownies.  Bring my sunglasses and Sims, if its loaded, please.  I guess I'll be meeting you guys Saturday...I don't have school tomorrow, so if anyone needs to talk, I'll be home most of the day.
      
</post>

<date>07,May,2003</date>
<post>

    
       
      I'd like to point to a key phrase in one of Lindsey's posts: "...sit down and talk this thing out like adults, because that's what we are..." and also, "if we can't work little miniscule problems like this out, we'll never get any of life's other problems figured out". BIGBIGBIG.  Wars start like this, because people get too pissed and fight about worthless things. Nationalism, for example. War is retarded. In fact, it's just as retarded as this whole conflict. I'm not sure who is proliferating this argument, but it's ridiculous; I'm not even sure if this conversation is necessary. Friends work things out, and obviously,  very  obviously, if I might add, the two of you are NOT friends; dare I say, enemies? Yes, I dare.  Broken trust is, in fact, quite inconsequential to the whole deal anymore. Whether or not one of you betrayed the other is just one of those miniscule matters that doesn't need to be dealt with, because it happened, and whatever the case, it can't be helped now. It seems sort of pointless having this brawl on Saturday: all that's going to happen is they're going to rip each other's heads off for five hours, whilst I sit back and eat Abby's wonderful cupcakes with sprinkles, just for me :) : the point is, there isn't a damn thing we can say that will change any opinions here, life isn't like the movies, and this isn't going to work itself out peacefully, since history does repeat itself, and history has been a cold-hearted vagrant thus far.  I don't know how this happened, but it's really a terrible shame. After all, having a friend is knowing someone's faults and overlooking them, simply because you call them friend. Alex has been one of my best friends for years. We constantly knock the shit out of each other, call each other faggots, Alex is too conceited and he thinks I'm too melodramatic; and truly, we're both right. But instead of capitalizing on the fact that we're not the best humans in the world, we use it to our advantages and just laugh at ourselves for all the stupid stuff we've done; we laugh at other people; and in the end, whether there are problems with one another, we really don't fucking care, because Alex is my  friend , come hell or high water.  So here's my take on it: no one's going to give any ground for this, and if any ground is given, it will only be temporary: one will find something wrong that the other has done, it will resurrect all these long dead demons, etc.; also, the parties involved are too emotional about this whole deal, it's been  way  blown out of proportion, and we're arguing about the wrong things. And moreover, and yes, I realize I've already said this,  NO ONE INVOLVED IS GOING TO REALLY LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE .   Was anyone really looking for the good way out of this? It could have ended if the parties involved weren't so stubborn, it could have ended long ago, and it might have had a better ending. If everyone else actually truly believes we can get somewhere out of this soon-to-be debacle at Abby's, then I'm all for you, and I'll be at the front row just like the rest of you, catching the teeth as the competition batters each other to no living end, I'll be there until we taste their tears and make the anger our own and totally lose it and never speak to one another again, just because a little spat turned into a never-ending feud, everyone allies with everyone else, and there is no "circle" anymore, it's just loose confederacies as we all try to get the others to see it our way.  But if anyone can see at all what a bad idea this is to carry on with number three, then please back me up, because I'm sure no one can honestly envision any good end coming to a head at the end of that day. Look where all of our good intentions have landed us in this situation this far.

      ok let me put it this way, from 10:30-11:30 on Sat. Is my piano lesson then from 12:00-12:45 I will be in Nashville at my dance rehersal. Then that afternoon I have to finish a Research paper, do a conic and review packet for pre-calc, do so shopping for amanda's present, and prolly some gardening. On Sunday it's Mother's Day so I'll be at church from 7:45 to about 11:15. Then my dad will prolly take me to practice my driving and at 5pm I will have to go to church again for a dress rehersal that I can NOT miss. So if you can find a dot in that schedule where I can meet I would be happy to.   The weekend after that starts like this: Friday night I'll be at Erika's Graduation Open House and prolly will be there til 12 or so. Then Sat at 10am I will perform for the end-of-the-year program at Ekin. Then I will have my piano lesson and then start stressing about exams again but supposedly that is also when the will-josh-becca b-day party is. We'll prolly also have some kind of bible study gathering because it'll be out last devos week together before we break for summer. Then on Sunday church is 8-10:30. At night it's like 5-8 since that's our performance.   The weekend after that is Piano and then at 3-5 is Amanda's Grad. Open House. Then Sunday we'll have the usually stuff. That weekend I think is also the weekend before exams so yeah you all know me so my stress level will be around 99% full.  Yes I know I sound like I don't want to talk to her because of my busy schedule but honestly i wish i could do it but i'm not going to screw up the schedule that has been set for a couple of weeks now. She was a friend and i think that i need to get on with my life.

      Well, we have Abby's house Saturday at noon.  We all REALLY need to try our best to be there, because this isn't something that's going to go away on its own.  From the posts, apparently yall want to go with #3.  This is about our only opportunity, and we really need to take advantage of it.  We need to talk this out in person, and unless someone else has a better suggestion, this is going to be our only chance.  Besides, I don't know how long we can last without having this little conversation...

      I was close to doing that Will. This is her way of telling me that I wronged her. I know that we should talk it out but this weekend I have dance, piano, a research paper, and other exams to review for not to mention it is Mother's day on Sunday and we also have a choir practice Sunday night and we have to sing in the service. So I'm only slightly busy this weekend =).

      Thanks for explaining that Elizabeth.  It cleared somethings up.  And Rosie, I don't know you.  I don't think that there is anything wrong with you, but I've only been on the blog for like...not very long.  I'm just going to stay out of this problem, but I would choose choice number three.  It sounds like it would be the most helpful.  It will be hard, but I think that its the best.  If you need a house thats neutral territory, mine is always open.  Anyway, got Church tonight, so fun stuff right there.  Another lecture on what I'm doing wrong.

      Dear Goddess, see what happens when I don't post for a few months?  Everything goes straight to hell.    ;)  But seriously, folks.  I really don't know what to do in this case.  I've had a long heart-to-heart with Tao Tao (used purely affectionately, my dear Rosie *grin*) and I can honestly say that I'm on her side in this, too, but not as fervently as Linds.  I see myself as a Switzerland leaning towards joining Rosie's side.  Becca, to be quite frank, is pissing me off badly.  Those little jabs I've been throwing, well, they haven't been jokes even though I said I was just kidding.  After all, who can tell with me, anyway?  As far as my opinion stretches, 1 is not an option, Linds.  This has gone on for too long and I am sick to death of it.  We either take advantage of her offer in the written format or take advantage of the offer face-to-face.  It's up to you guys, but I will go along as long as 1 isn't the solution.  2 or 3 work fine.  And I agree with Linds's analysis of Becca's little letter.  Ouch.  But it's just another strike against her...and if she was playing baseball, she would already be way, way out.  Now, on to the other subjects that have been discussed.  First of all, I am SO SORRY, Josh, about all you had to go through this weekend.  I know that this is belated, but this was the first chance I've had to take a look at this website in FOREVER.  I hope you are feeling better and if not, that you will be soon.  Also so sorry about your kitty.  But (and this applies to Linds and Abby dearests, too) I am afraid that I'm not getting involved in this philosophical debate about whether or not life sucks.  I can just simply state my opinion.  It sucks.  My family is falling apart and not only is it tearing me apart, it is also planting the seeds of apathy everywhere I go.  I don't care about anything anymore.  I'm forcing myself to get focused for school but it just getting so damn hard.  My dad moved out this weekend and I haven't seen him in at least a week, perhaps more.  Not that that bothers me...I'm afraid that I'm going to try and strangle him next time I see him because this shit that he's caused has driven me to therapy.  That was mostly for Abby's benefit, since I believe that you guys already know about this.  Now, new subject.  I am also sorry about all the shit you've been through, Will.  I kind of know how you feel about birthday parties, but not in such a severe case.  My parties, though few and very far between, have been left up to me, so I could choose who I wanted to invite and who not.  Anyway, again I am very sorry about all of that, and what do you want for your birthday?  I'm probably going to get you something anyway, so tell me something you want to make it easier for both of us.  Whereas Josh is a complete enigma...and I know he doesn't want anything, or at least he told me that.  And don't get me started on Becca...  Anyway, let's see, what else...OH!  Michael.  That bastard.  So he was scared to read my e-mail.  Good.  Let him be VERY afraid.  Nobody does that to MY best friend and gets away with it.  I hope it scarred him for life.  Anyway, he responded to it and I responded to his response...blah blah blah.  In short, he got what he deserved, the prick, and I hope that he is haunted by this for a long while.  Ahhh...that felt good.  Now, as a final note to this post that is rapidly approaching saga length, I hope that everyone gets a kick out of my goofy humor in all the right places and can pick out my seriousness, however little of it there is.  Also...PLEASE don't scold me for any of the things I've said, about Michael or Becca or whoever the hell else that is pissing me off lately...like my dad.  Anyhow, it's a brief venting phase (not with my dad, however) and I think getting that out of my system helped.    Z has returned to the building.  Everything will be fine from now on.  ;)  Sure.   ~Z

      Wow.  That was the best approach to being mean without actually being mean that I've ever seen in my entire life.  Now, what are we going to do about this?  We've got a couple of options. 1) Completely ignore this and write it off as Becca trying to blow some steam. 2) Write her back and do exactly what she asked, which is insult the crap out of her.  And my personal favorite, 3) Go to somebody's house NOT at school, all of us (except maybe Abby, cause she really doesn't know anybody), and sit down and talk this thing out like adults, because that's what we are, and if we can't work little miniscule problems like this out, we'll never get any of life's other problems figured out.  We need to set up some ground rules and enforce them, and this needs to be done SOON, as in this weekend.  There are bigger problems in the world than out little group, so let's just settle this now, and get it over with.  I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one getting sick of this.  I know for a fact that things need to be said.  Let's get everything out in the open, because I'm pretty sure the heart of the matter hasn't been brought up yet.  And that's all I have to say about that.  What do yall think?

      You know I'm to the point of unfeeling when I got this e-mail from Becky. It's all been said but I honestly just feel like not talking right now becuase I don't think I can truly be nice for awhile.  Hey.    First off, nothing I say in this email is meant as hostility and  what I say is an attempt at being respectful-I'm not sure if you'll agree,  though.     Next, I realize you've repeatedly told me a number of things. ex1:  don't complain. ex2: you've said in the past month or so to tell michael  the truth. ex3: a lot of people dislike me.     Now, I honestly haven't thought any of it for reasons I'll keep to  myself. (you don't need to know them and I don't wish to explain them.)  But it hasn't been until recently that I've actually weighed them with  the type of measure that they deserve. (Plus, no one has been out right  mean to me in a while, and I thought it was just another one of our  fights.)    All I'm saying is "you won" so to speak. I'll rethink how I act and  try not to complain, I'll try to be a lot nicer, and I already broke up  with Michael. I know you don't respect me anymore and I haven't decided  if that is truly such a bad thing. (De Nihilo nihil... a latin saying  means from nothing comes nothing. ie, i can't screw something up that i  don't have.) All I know is that if other people are mad at me then  something must be wrong. I promise I'll try, and that's a promise I am  making to you all.     The only thing I'm asking of you is this: If I'm going to attempt to  change my ways, I'm going to need to know everything that I need to  change. I'm giving you a blank slate here... write down exactly what you  dislike about me or what you think I ought to change in order to be a  better person. If you don't tell me what to change, then I can't change  anything. I'm not asking you to stop being mad at me. I'm not asking you  to stop insulting me everytime you see me. I'm not asking you to stop  making the comments to Mike. (As is I don't like anyone. I'm sick of the  same outcome, and things will never change. Bf/Gf life doesn't matter.  period. And I'm sick of skirting around like a little 6th grader in  puppy love.)    So, basically, here's your chance. You can insult me. You can laugh  at me. You can tell people I like them, even if I don't, and I'm not  going to do a thing about it. You can spread rumors about me. You can  tell others lies about me. Fact is, I'm done being angry with everything.  It's not worth it anymore. God gave us friends to cherish them and I  didn't, so now's your chance to repay that wrong. I was wrong and all you  have to do is tell me more of how so. I hope things can change between  us, and I'll try to be the best person possible. Sorry for not  realizing it earlier. Bye.   I just love how she accuses me of spreading rumors about her.....I love her....oh wait I don't.   Smile all, Life's just peachy keen. *sarcasm*

      You have to understand that most of my really bitter posts are geared not towards something I actually believe in but getting everyone to think I believe in it and see how they react from there. I don't know if there is a point to life, but it doesn't bother me: whether there is or not, the important thing is  to live  instead of being concerned with the question. Basically, that other post was a lot of shit to see if anyone was really getting to the same point as I made therein. There was a lot of anger; I guess I was just getting tired of the constant "kids fighting a grown up war", tip-toeing around the real issues but spilling blood over the little ones which they heedlessly chose to fight about.  I was really more angry about my cat though...thanks for your concern, Abby, I'm ok. I really love cats, enough that there  IS NO POINT  when one dies. Alright, not really, I just really love my kittens :) And I can't hear anything, hardly, my ears are still ringing, so, to all, don't be suprised to hear me going "WHAT?" about nine times to everything you say to me.   What a year it's been...come, summer, come.

      Oh my gosh.  I'm so sorry Josh.  I really hope you are ok.  I guess I don't really know what to say except that I hope you and everyone else is all right.  I want everyone to know, though, that if you ever need anything...food, a person to talk to, anything, just call me.  Lindsey has my phone number and my e-mail is gourmetchef13@hotmail.com....obviously I'm good at the cooking part and my friends say that I am a very good listener.  Josh, I really hope you are alright.  And I hope that you still find a reason for life.  And, Linds, I need more people to put down as room-mates for choir tour.

      Sorry Abby, you have to understand that yesterday was the conclusive bad day to the worst day ever. Let me tell you all about it. And sorry to everyone else if I slighted you in any way, just hear me out first.  The day started out normally...sort of. I woke up after four hours of sleep, not being able to get back to that euphoric state of rest and feeling generally sluggish. I went and drank some really strong coffee. Then I took my Doryx, a face medicine. Without food, Doryx, in me, causes a chemical reaction that induces serious vomiting...that's why, when I was on my way to the movies to see XMen 2, I pulled over on the side of Ellington Parkway and vomited my guts out for the duration of fifteen minutes. Had I a simple cracker on hand I could have been safe. But no; I puked my guts out and sat down to breathe for another five or so. My dad pulled off (he took the driver's seat after this), and we had lunch with a friend at the Baja Burrito downtown, whereafter we saw X2, and it was wonderful. After it was over I got a call.  It was my mom. She said she had found my cat, not that he had been missing. It was that he was dead. I didn't really cry over it, but it got me to thinking about everything and it really seemed pointless. That's when I went to the library and, in those memory-filled surroundings, I composed that post. I haven't read it since, nor do I plan to.  I went home then. At home I sat around, I tried reading, I found my mind coming back to this post and the general reaction to it, I figured no one would really like it. I didn't care. My dad was watching TV, and he saw a commercial for Sonic.  "Let's go," he said, "see if we can get back before eight," to WATCH A TV SHOW.   The drive was quick, dad was over the speed limit at least twelve miles an hour the whole time, but we made it. The order was quick, and we left just as quickly.  Coming down Ben Allen Road there is an intersect with the I-96 exits. A Lexus waited, wanting to make a left turn.  Dad was doing 50, 10 miles over the limit on Ben Allen.  The car rolled out too far and stopped in the right lane, My dad changed lanes.  The car rolled into the left lane, which we were presently in, and stopped.  I heard the breaks screeching, I saw it coming and gripped the sides of the car hard. I had enough time to scream, "Oh shit." Then it was chaos.  The initial punch of the airbags was loud. It shattered my side of the windshield into a million piees and my open, screaming mouth caught a few, which I would be coughing up for the duration of the night. The belt caught me hard on the shoulder and tore it a bit; I had a mild lasceration and a belt-shaped bruise over my chest. I did not touch the bag. My dad, on the other hand, caught him full in the face; he got a bit of a shiner and his shoulder is beaten up pretty bad. And I got covered in vanilla flavoured Coca-Cola.   I managed to reach over and turn off the car, I could smell the transmission about to start on fire, coupled with the excessive sulphurous smell of the bags freshly deflated. The first thing I did was get out of the car, scream "FUCK!" to an audience of awe-struck people, and began kicking the car yelling the profanity until I remembered the lady in the gold Lexus, who was not getting out of her car.   Her leg was stuck and she had some diaphragm damage. The resultant ambulance and  five other emergency vechicles  were able to take care of her, not to mention the FIVE police men.   My dad's car was totaled, the Lexus had its axle bent in half, so the tire is like "/" that instead of "|" this.   There was a concrete island for one of the on-ramps, and I sat there, eating fries, reading Rosie's French dictionary, clutching my bleeding shoulder, and shaking my head as I looked up at the smoking wreck every few minutes. I read until the sun went down, and then I just stared at the wreck until they took it all away, I got into the back of a police cruiser, and we sped toward my house. The cop did  twenty over  until we got home. I got my mom to pick us up, I took two Benadryls, and I knew no more.  Jerry Cantrell once said "Dying a little bit helps you appreciate life", and I really think it has.  Sorry all, and excuse me while I go spit up some more glass.

      Lindsey...you're scarying me but I'm in a good mood too so I'll not run and hide. Apparently my mom thought really late was 12:30 so Gunter had to drop me home early...that was the only bad part about yesterday....I hate curfews....bleh. Laser Quest was great.....but the guys kicked the girl's butts.....take the girl's score times 2 and add like 5,000...yeah......Killing tyree....Anyway it was fun fun fun. Got to know some peeps better but guess what!! they're leaving soon...crap. Also pedchenko is now dating Haley woods....as Becca predicted and I confirmed so...be nice to Becky on that point. We first just bummed at Erika's house and then booked it to Laser Quest with the girls in erika's van and guys in gunter's car. Well...yeah they got there in like 5 min but we got lost. We had to call the place and ask for the addy but we decided not to tell the guys that we got lost....we had to get gas right? of course? but no....the guys running the place told gunter, tom, and them and @.@..they wouldn't shut up. So yeah they had their egos inflated for awhile...till erika beat them all on the second game....*smirk* then we stopped at Relay for Life...or what not...interest....really interesting....they had this talent thing going and wow...nails on the chalk board would have been better than some...bumped into Steven and Jason... they were going to sing but I wasn't going o spend my night waiting for them to go since they were last so we stopped at Block Buster for 8 miles....yeah don't smirk...my mom isn't going to know. We raced home...of couse gunter wins....erika never speeds that badly and you know that turn at franklin to concord.....see if there are any tire marks......let's just say that if we were in my explore....ouch! He almost went on to that triangle. *shakes head* what's with guys and winning.  So it's like 11:30 already when we get to her house. Her mom freaks out saying: i don't care that you're here but are you parents ok with it....of course we all nod our heads off. O:-) but them my mom calls at 12:30...bleh and gunter decided to leave because he has to drop by relay for life again. I don't think he made it though.....he looked pretty tired....really tired. Hope he's not dead in his car because he fell asleep at the wheel....kidding...he's fine....i think. Anyway happy birthday to everyone in the coming year...I suck at dates so don't expect me to remember. Really. Ok bye. have fun

      Lucky for you, I did not ever say what this project was, due to the fact that it is utterly stupid, and saying what it was on makes me feel D-U-M dumb.  We had to follow this baseball team (mine was the White Sox) and then do all this mean, median, mode stuff.  Yeah, I know.  that's from sixth grade, blah blah blah.  I get it.  But the point is, it brought my average up to and A.  A freaking A. In MATH.  ALGEBRA II, no less.  And Josh is getting a record deal, and the Becca thing is settled, and school is over in less than a week, and adam is here, and everything is just going right in the world for once.  I am a happy happy happy person... I'm going to bed.  Happy belated Birthday, Will, and happy early birthday Josh.  I love you all.  I love you I love you I love you...Yall are the best friends ever.  AHHHHHH!!!  I'm in SUCH a GREAT mood.  And Abby's birthday is in 2 months and 2 days, so happy birthday to you too.  And yes, of course you're better than I am, in most ways.  I'm much better at talking to guys for you than you are..heehee.  GOOD MOOD.  To quote both Josh and the guy on Billy Jack..."THAT HEATHEN DEVIL WEED, MARAJUANA!"  God, gotta love that movie (as long as Mr. Adams is there to comment.  The only time I would want him in the room.)  I love my life.  Oh happy day!  See yall tomorrow!

      Awesome, I was all for the white cake anyway.   I  have a teenage little sister, and I must say...if it's bad now, it's only  THAT MUCH WORSE IN PUBERTY . It's hellshine over here when Katie (my sister) is on her period...Katie also has a penchant for selfishness and a twisted sense of justice. She must always have her way or there is no way...and then the aftershocks therein: slamming doors, whining, crying, yelling, and my mom stupidly sitting there and just repeating over and over it's just the way she was brought up. Well mom,  YOU  brought her up, so why not just CHANGE something? LORDY. Sorry, but I've been ULTRA mad at my sis lately and the whole twisted sister thing just sort of brought all that frustration to mind.  Of course Abby is the coolest. Look at her feet, for Pete's sake. Look at her smallness in general. Look at the fact that she said "Boy howdy, are they neato" in her last post...I don't think I've heard that phrase since 1955, and my mom was, like, one then, if at all. And elephant socks, bonus. Okok, I'll stop before I get the "psycho stalker" brand across my forehead and Rosie gets too jealous again :)  YAY LINDS on the math projects, you posted something similar in my BLog and I figured this would be the first place you would go, so I'll congratulate you here. Umm....what was the project by the way? Heh, sorry if I'm being an ignoramus, I haven't been able to read much lately because of hellacious fourth period (my usual computer slacking time) drillings on PowerPoint, and recording sessions/visits to the ER/awards ceremonies eating up my time after I get home. And you probably sat there and told me a thousand times in fifth, and I was probably sitting there nodding my head and laughing when it seemed appropriate, all the while waltzing in that little exciting electric impulse world in my brain, somewhere out there.  Don't know about the rest of you, but I'm stoked for the party guys. It may be a small, informal gathering (and considering some elements therein, it could be chaotic) but it'll be great. I don't know what to bring tho. Suggestions, perhaps? I probably won't even read this until it's too late anyway...tomorrow, I wake up and hit the showers, then, with the towel still around my waist, run downstairs and open the door for Alex and a stand-in lead guitarist and try not to be called a fag for opening the door being essentially nekked, then I run upstairs and record for  five and one half hours , or until my fingers start bleeding, because, and mark me on this, we're going to get this EP done and cut a deal with the record company before summer is over. Alls we need is five songs, and if you read the latest BLog we've now got it. Ok sorry guys, this is boring, but I'm just stoked about everything so much I'm gonna pop. It's going to be an awesome weekend, der perfekte cap-off for a pretty lousy week.  Goodbye fair BLog and all the happy citizens who dwell within.

I remember when I was that young, there must have been like 20 billion people who wanted to shoot me.  Anyway, I'm better than you?  Wow, that's really sweet to say Linds.  You know all my bad qualities, yet you still think of me that way.  Awww....anyway, congratulations on math!  I wish I could say the same thing...yeh, right, like that'll ever happen.  Humm....yeh...I would say more, but there is nothing else to say.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  By the way, did you know that BHS was having the Relay for Life tonight?  I went for a little while, but didn't feel like walking for 12 hours, so I left, but I did get a VERY cool sash and medal.  Boy howdy, are they neato. Peace out.

      Ugh.  I usually love my little sister to death, but she is just being an absolute witch lately.  She's mad about and at everything.  She even got mad at her puppy.  How can you get mad at Maddie?  It's like getting mad at Josh...it just doesn't happen!  Everything I say is wrong and stupid and I'm always getting on her nerves unless she needs me to do something.  God, I do NOT want to see this child as a teenager.  I'm starting to be very glad that I'll be leaving home in a couple of years so I won't have to deal with all this brattiness anymore.  I know part of it is my fault for spoiling her when she was little, but this is way over the whole "I-want-it-give-it-to-me" brattiness.  It's the "I'm-better-than-you-and-I know-more-than-you-do-unless-I need-you-to-do-something-for-me-then-I'll-be-really-sweet" type brattiness.  That is one of those things that just gets on my nerves to no end.  NO one is better than I am, except for maybe Abby or Adam, and of course my grandmother, who's just practically better than everyone else on this planet.  But that's not the point.  She isn't a saint or a God, she's an eleven year old little girl who hasn't the decency to keep her mouth shut when she needs to.  I love the kid to death, and there is no way I'd ever start a fight over this, but I really needed to get that out so I won't scream at her.  Liz, don't you wish you had siblings?

      She hasn't tasted MY chocolate chip cookies yet... Anyway, I think Becca is taken care of, but I'll reaffirm that tomorrow with her.  I think Travis is ok, but, remember me last year?  That's who he reminds me of.  We talked about that and he agreed.  It was like talking to myself all over again.  So anyway, I resent the convo.  Oh, and people, what kind of cake do we want?  I'm thinking white w/ white frosting, cause that's what I like, but we're always open to suggestions.  What do yall think?  I need a vote here, cause Abby needs to make the cake tomorrow so she can frost it saturday.  I'm getting good at this cooking stuff.  You can thank my teacher, who wrote the post directly below this.

      Ok, um, slight problem.  Becca thinks that the party on Saturday is also for her.  In fact she was talking about it last night saying that she was so happy to be having 1/3 of the party devoted to "Becca Worship."  Well, ok, she wasn't saying exactly that, (in fact nothing close to it) but she still went on and on about her "third" of the party. Something needs to be done about that then.  We don't want an unhappy Becca.  Its not a pretty site.  Anyway, my cookies got VERY good reviews.  Kyndall (my friend from school) said they were the best chocolate-chip cookies she had ever had.  I'm not trying to make you feel bad or anything....haha.  The bags are just about done anyway.  And Travis is gone.  Please re-send the convo, Linds.  It didn't work.  I'm kinda worried about him, is he alright at all?  Peace out.

      I don't think so ma'am, pretty sure that she's not in.  Sorry for not coming last night, I would've made it but my drum teacher was showing me his new 2 million dollar studio which he bought for a quarter of that, about 480 thousand, and it took up more time than I expected. Eagh.  Whee, can't wait til Saturday.

      NO one is going to have ANYTHING come up, except Rosie, who is already excused, sort of.  But I couldn't come tonight, as I explained in your lovely e-mail.  The party is now 6:00-10:00.  PM, obviously.  And um, yeah, I think everything else on the invitiation was right.  Yall all know how to get here, even Josh, so that shouldn't be an issue.  Yes, it's this Saturday.  Remember to bring a snack, otherwise there will be nothing to eat.  Not chex mix, though.  I despise chex mix, and it is not allowed in my house.  Blech.  Puppy chow is ok, though.

      I enjoyed the spelling of "typos". Heh.  Why yes, the 17th  is  this Saturday. But don't worry too much, we all know everyone is going to have something come up and then no one will be able to go.  Eagh, at least I'll be 16, woowoo.

      So, if the Becca thing is over, that means you guys can come to the Church tonight to help me staple pieces of paper to 1000 bags, right?  (There will be chocolate-chip cookies involved, baked by yours truly.)  Anyway, I'm glad the whole thing is over.  Is the 17th this saturday?  I think I can come.  Does there need to be any major baking done for it?  I'm willing to do something.  Happy Birthday Will and Josh (even though its kinda late/early)!!!

      Because Lindsey has high on drugs, her invite needed some reforms so here they are....actually she just sent it to the wrong address for Josh.  Ah, Will poses a good question.  Here's what I'm thinking.    Who: In reverse alphabetical order by first name, because I've always  hated  the whole school system of things, here's who's coming: Will, Rosie,  Lindsey, Josh, Elizabeth, Abby.  Feel free to invite other people, as  long  as I know them and like them. i.e. not Becca, any of Becca's  counterparts,  or anyone else obnoxious like Jared or Lumley, but God knows there's  more  where they came from.  I'm thinking, Philip or Jacob or Julian  (heehee),  people from our study hall would be good to invite. What: Birthday Party for Josh and Will When: Saturday May 17, 2003 at 5ish-10ish (I'll confirm those tomorrow) Where: Lindsey's house, probably basement Why: Josh and Will are turning sixteen   Bring: Your own snack/munchie/food...whatever   I will confirm all but the obvious tomorrow. -El Presidente  Oh yeah...I'm not going. If Becca isn't going and I'm not and Phil could go see a movie with....yeah......he's not going to be there. Sorry all.  Bye Bye

      I'll see if I can, surely. Not sure because I have a lesson about that time, but my mom is just intrigued with my going to church so much these days :)  Abby just made the best case, and since that makes two of us, I think it's about time. Don't knock it til you tried it, I guess.

      Linds, you brought up a good point that I had completely forgotten about.  You guys have been there for me with this whole divorce shit, but Becca MADE ME CRY.  Let me say that again.  Cry.  Me.  Z.  The implacable.  Or something.  ;) And then again, she didn't really do it, but I was in such a bad mood to begin with that arguing with her and trying to prove how much pain I was in made me cave.  But I'm doing better now.  Honest.  Well, I think.  I also was upset for Becca at the time.  Obviously I know what it's like to lose people, whether they're leaving or dying, but I had no idea that this was some DISTANT relation.  For all I know, she really did care, except for Linds's testimony, but I can't believe that she would dare to think that an uncle, distant or not, is more important than someone's HOME LIFE FALLING DOWN AROUND HER.    I'm sorry if that was extraordinarily bitchy or mean or selfish, but now I'm really pissed off.  More so than I was before.  Linds was also right in the original sides thing.  Rosie, you really didn't turn me to your side.  I found out information, some from you and some from Linds or Will or whoever else, and that was what made me change my mind.  So don't feel guilty about it, Little China.  *grin*  Anyway, just had to say that.  Um, two things.  1) What did you mean when you said that Phillip's like me?  Just curious.  And 2) Those seniors have no idea what they're talking about, except for the biased story they've heard from Becca.  I mean, are they your friends, aside from Gunter?  If so, I don't know what you should do, but if not, then tell them to fuck off.  I'm serious.  They have no business getting involved.  Period.  Abby, I thought you knew me.  Kind of.  I'm not sure of that, but I thought you did.  ;)  hehehe  Also...if you don't want to hear anymore about the divorce, let me know, but I'm kind of using this Blog to get it off my chest.  I don't really have another place.  Anyway, this weekend my dad and I had bonding time.  ALL SATURDAY.  It was all right, but not really awesome except that I did get to see X2 which was REALLY GOOD.  Anyway, on Saturday I went to his new house.  Not to stay but just to look around.  It's in Mooreland, that place on Moores Lane on the way to the mall.  It's really little and WHITE.  It feels like a sterile environment.  I'm making him have my room painted.  Anyway, that's about it, but it was pretty hard to do it.  Don't think he picked up on that, so I guess that I'm making it through all right.  So, back to Operation Becca, just one question.  What the hell are we actually going to do about it?  Please let me know just so I have an inkling.    I feel like I should be really guilty about something or other right now.   Nah.  ;)  ~Z

      I've been reading all of these entries about the whole Becca/Rosie thing, and I know that I'm not directly involved.  But I think that you guys know what you need to do, but keep skirting around it.  In my opinion, it seems like you guys have "decided" to just stop "interacting" with Becca, but are scared to see what will happen when you actually say the words.  I think you know what will happen.  There will be tears, there will be yelling, there will be pretty much every emotion you have experienced and some you haven't.  It will be hard, but I think thats what you guys need to do.  Please don't take my opinion too seriously though.  I really don't know any of you, except for Linds, Josh and Becca.  This is just what I've deducted from hearing about the situations from the blog and Linds.    I know this might be a kinda bad time to say this, but I really need help with a food drive I'm in charge of at church.  On Sunday, I (and a whole bunch of other people) are handing out plastic bags with a list of food that the Nashville Rescue Misson needs.  I was able to get about 1000 plastic bags donated by Wal-Mart, but I need people to help staple the list to the bag.  If any of you could get to Brentwood Methodist between 5 and 5:15, (and maybe bring a stapler) I would be really really really appreciative.  I'll even bake some cookies, if that entices anyone.  Slight disclaimer though, Becca does go to Wednesday night stuff at church and most likely will be there at that time.

      1) We can't call a peace treaty if both sides don't sign. 2) We're not ganging up on Becca because everyone has different opinions. 3) Rosie did not turn us against Becca.  We did that ourselves, out of our own free will.  If you'll remember, Liz and I were originally on Becca's side.    What we need to do is what we planned on Friday.  Have Josh talk to her because he's on best terms with her, and well, nobody in their right mind can get too mad at Josh.  I've tried it, it's pretty impossible.  Then when she comes back in the room, perhaps we can talk it out rationally, but I'm starting to really doubt it.    There is not going to be peace again.  Ever.  But everyone is going to have to deal with the fact that a stalemate basically means that she's out of our little "group" and that we're more of acquaintances than friends.  Not neccessarily enemies, but definitely not friends.  Never again friends, no matter how much wishing.  It would take a change not only of heart, but identity as well, and everyone knows that will never happen.  Rosie, like I said on the phone, this isn't just a mindset.  This is Becca.  This isn't just some cover-up of insecurity.  She TRULY thinks that she's better than us, that we are supposed to worship her, and that her life, her problems, are much more important than everyone else's.  Remember the day Liz told yall her parents were getting divorced, and Becca told her that she didn't care because some distant uncle that I KNOW she's only seen once, like when she was four, was dying?  That was the biggest bunch of BS I've ever seen, but she truly believed that her distant uncle was more important than Liz's parents.  Let me ask you, how many times has that been mentioned ever again?  Oh yeah, never.  Whereas Liz broke down the other day over her parents (not to make you look weak, Liz, but to illustrate my point.)  I'm not saying Becca's problems aren't important, I'm saying that a good friend supports her friends, not try to make her problems look bigger than everyone else's.  And she definitely doesn't yell at someone who is on the verge of tears and antagonize them until they break down.  That is not what a friend does.  A friend hugs and listens, and dispenses tissues.  Do I dare say that Becca has NEVER been our friend?  Yes, I dare.

      Well...  Rosie, let me be quite frank with you, if you haven't heard this already, though I think you have...as to taking the middle ground. I think there should be some fundamental truths put on the table before I digress my point: firstly, we've been through a lot, whereas I've not with Becca. Second, despite how biased some of the accounts may have been, and despite all the bullshit floating around about this whole story, I'm inclined to believe against Becca, and this mostly correlates with point number three, you  are  my friend, and I'm pretty sure that I speak for all of us when I say that we certainly won't turn on you; and at the very least,  I  will not.   It's an interesting concept, Becca is fronting for the war and we're drafting the peace treaty. I can't really feel nice towards Becca since I feel like she's tried to get to me a few times...but I guess I'll put on my best face and try to do this painlessly. Slowly all the roles we act out become our identity, and in the end we are what we pretend to be. It may be that you've had a part in turning us, but we made the last decision to turn angst against her.  If there can't be peace, then let's call it a stalemate.

      Hey everyone,  I told Becca that we would tlak to her tomorrow. I'm talking to her right now and well....i'm comflicted. I honestly believe that she thinks that she's been the best of friends to us. Also want to choke her because she's managed to make pedchenko, marissa, and other people think that I'm the devil and that i'm the meanst person alive. She "tried" with philip but luckily he's kinda like Z....in more ways than one lucky for me. But also, she's bringing the whole documentations to prove that she's the nice one. I hope that you all don't turn on me like pedchenko did but then again you are closer to me. I love you all....even abby because it seems that she's worthy of Linds. Pray guys. Also...josh i don't think that you should confront her alone. Actually i don't think that you guys should confront her at all. you should stand in the middle all. she thinks that i turned you against her....and i pray that i haven't. please...if you want to talk to her...everyone be there in a happy mood to talk things out. i don't want fighting. i'm so sick of it.

      Abby...*sigh*  Anyway, no chocolate chips?  Why banana bread with no chocolate chips?  Chocolate chips on the side???  Chior is at 8:00.  I'll call you in the morning un case you don't get this in time.  Liz isn't coming to Ren Fest with us anymore.  But I just got home from baby-sitting, and got enough to cover my outfit and maybe my food.  Which is great, because the kids I sat for are  wonderful   Emily is four and Andrew is eight.  Emily fell asleep on my arm why we were watching Lady and the Tramp II (which was actually pretty decent for a sequel) and I had to carry her up to bed, put on her pull-ups and pajama pants.  By that time, I was so tired from trying to get her out of the knot she was creating in the sheets and from trying to move the cat from between her and me, that I just left her shirt on.  I told her parents, and they were like, yeah, they do that a lot.  I was thinking "Clue to an earlier bedtime?" but hey, that's their choice.  Anyway, the reason I actually came on here was to tell yall that it's just Abby, Josh, and me going to Ren Fest tomorrow.  Rosie, I have no idea how to get there because I've always hitched a ride. Call Josh, maybe he'll know.  Good Night, All.  I'm tired.  And Josh, no more posts at 2:00 am.  Go to bed!!!

      I have no idea how to get to Renfest.  That's why I'm riding with other people.  I'm sorry Linds, but I've been boating all day long, I couldn't call you from there.    Hey, if anyone is REALLY bored tomorrow, do you want to come to my school's graduation?  It will be SUPER fun.  And, um...I know this is WAY too late to be asking this, but what time do we have to be at choir in the morning?  Yeh, cause I have no idea.    Wow, so I just re-read my entry from last night and it is almost impossible to read.  I'm sorry.  I was a little hyper from about 15 cokes in a 20 minute time period.    I made cookies this evening.  And banana bread.  The cookies are for sunday school/small groups tomorrow and the bread (sorry, no chocolate-chips this time) are for my parents sunday school class.  Yeh, so I have nothing else to write.  Oh yeh, I was making these cookies and my dad came in and was looking for something to eat for dessert.  Well, he wanted a cookie, but I told him no.  So, he goes for the twix bar we have in the pantry.  He starts complaining, so I tell him that he should have the twix ice cream instead.  Well, apparently he can't have that cause it's full fat.  Aren't those two items the same thing pretty much?  I'm confused, cause neither is reduced fat in the first place, yet the ice cream has full fat.  Whatever.

      Woo guys, here I am. What a cool day, study hall was amazing. No, I'm serious.  We just sat there, with three people, and watched TV and played PS2 the whole time. And at one point we played monkey in the middle with a huge paper ball, and I didn't fail my French exam, HURRAY. And then Alex and I had a session and didn't get anything done, and we had Taco Bell, and it was awesome.  And right now, I made a new BLog so as to log the huge post...it's huge, and really weird...a lot of me talking in the past using my thoughts, random snippets of songs that I throw in here and there. It isn't a great idea to be writing this thing at two in the morn, so I'm going to put it off for a while and see what I can do tomorrow night.  Eleven sounds good to me. Dress up? BONUS.

I am totally dressing up...well, if someone else dresses up with me. And I'm totally talking like that.  I would like to be a Lady, I think...it just sounds cool...."Good morrow, my lady.  How dost thou fair this lovely morn?"  Ahhhhh...I loved playing dress-up as a child...all the wonderful memories.....(this is when i become nostalgic).....anyway...I'm looking forward to this entire weekend!  Tomorrow, I'm going on a boat all day long, Sunday, is graduation, and Monday I get to talk in an english accent for several hours!  Yay!  There are so many simple joys in life...and what time are we going?  Linds and I thought that 11:00 would be a good time to go.  So...yup...fun stuff...where is everyone, btw?

        For all of yall going to Renaissance fair, and actually want to  enjoy  the experience, here's the proper way to speak.  And are we going to dress up, Josh/Liz/Abby?     The Elizabethan language is flirtatious, joyous, filled with risqu double entendre and political gossip. Elizabethans loved their language and their words were well chosen. Have fun with it. When in doubt make up a word by adding " 'st" to a conventional word such as "fill'st my cup".  "Hello", best said as "Good Day!", "Good morrow!", "Well met" "Good Bye" spoken as "Fare thee well!", "God save thee", "I shall see thee anon". "Yes" be "Aye"  "No" be "Nay"  "You" are certainly "Thou" "You would" or "You should" rolls best off the pecking tongue as "Thou would'st" or "Thou should'st". "Listen"takes power as "Hark" or "Hark now"  "Ignore that" best be whispered as "Shun that"  "Come here" moves more feet as "Come hither"  "A Salesperson" barks louder as a "Hawker" "Beer" slides down thy gullet easier as "Ale" "A Serving Woman" is a "Wench" unless you've met a "Maiden" who demonstrates a desire to serve.  "Until later" - "Anon" "Days"- "Morrow" "Evening"- "E'em"  "Never"- "Ne'r"  "Often"- "Oft"  "Why"- "Wherefore" "Maybe"- "Perchance"  "Away"- ''Aroint"  "Truly"- "Verily"  "Thank you" - "Grammercy"  EXAMPLES OF FAIRE BANTER   "He lies through his teeth!" translation "He be a prattler indeed!" "He killed himself" - "He's stuffed a red stocking" "It takes more than Sex to Make a marriage " - There's more belongs to a marriage than four bare legs in a bed" "They're having an affair" - "They've mixed sugar and sand". "What an idiot!" - "Thou dried meat's wag!" "You perfect son of a donkey's tail" - " Thou great and mighty clumperton"  THOU INSIDER TRICKS:  Hawkers revel in the good fun of barter with Competing craftsfolks. Get into the game. Should a Potter call out to you "No fine pots in all the Faire. Witness their colors rivaled only by God's rainbow". Respond with "Fie thou sneap! Note thy crack in thou fine pot". Address people by rank, title, occupation or physical description. "My Lord", "My Lady", "Good Shire", "Good Wife", "Lad" or "Lass", "Lusty Bar Maid", "Fearless Knight", "Juggler", "Silly Clown", "old Sailor", etc. Unlike contemporary society. the Elizabethan's had a socially stratified society. They were constantly aware of their social standing and the social standing of those around them. From necessity, addressing people was nearly an art form. In order to feel comfortable at Faire, you will need to have an insight to their social level and yours (the character you deem to be for the day). Fortunately, Faire people wear clothing in accordance with their social standing. The addresses used are based on a combination of social standing and familiarity. Ergo, the Earl of `Rycrofft could call the "Earl of Worth", "Worth", "My Lord cousin", etc. But a merchant or peasant would call both men "Lord", or "My Lord", or "My Lord, Earl".  "Sir" or "Mistress" be always a safe wager for a personage that is not nobility, but so well dressed as to signify upper class.  To nobility "my Lord" or "my Lady" is safe if you don't know their name or exact title. The Queen is referred to as "Your Highness", or "Your Grace''. In the third person, the Queen may be called "Her Highness. Dukes and Duchesses may also be addressed as "Your Grace".  Office holders such as Judges, Constables, or Bureaucrats, Knights and Squires may be called "Your Honour".   And there you go.  We've  got  to talk like this Monday.  Should be fun,fun!!!

Wow...this is still really really really really really really really really really really really really really really boring.  I think I'm going to listen to some music, cause there's nothing else to do, and no one is online. I hope that we still talk when we go off to college and stuff.  That would be really sucky if we didn't.

Ok so for you next birthday imagine this: Riley.........spot light........"riding" a water molecule with you as the..........need I say more? Sorry guys i'm bored and slowly edging into depression.

      I just posted, and it got deleted.  Will, that was the WORST PUN EVER. And Josh, you may be able to use Abby's name, but I can also say, "yeah, but I'm her bestest friend, so there." And then I win the argument.  Whit graduated today:(  My baby's growing up! And Mc Nair got arrested for being stupid.  Grrrr... Oh well, he got what he deserved I guess.  Stars shouldn't get special privledges, except for maybe solitary so that they're not beat up by people who like the Raiders or something.  Hmmm, what else?  Oh, I just ate @ TGI Fridays for the second night in a row.  I'm getting sick of it.  And I'm really excited about Renfest.  And Josh, my mom didn't care that your dad was going because she said that he wouldn't be able to "protect" me from you...right.  My mom just called in here to give Will a very important message:  "You are welcome here any time as long as you bring the lobster stuff and club crackers." OK, so my mom is slightly obsessed with that stuff now.  It's almost gone.  Speaking of obsessiveness, in response to Josh's question, my mom sent these to me off a cross-stitch message board.  That's right a CROSS STITCH MESSAGE BOARD... *Sigh* Oh well, at least she's being civil again...

      Will that was awful. Sorry about that post, I think I was sniffing cleaning supplies too much. Yes, my room is finally cleaned, organized, shined, and basically sanitized. Yay!  Well anyway Becky has Driver's Ed on Monday so she can't go. *Smirk* Anyway I was just trying to say that I've spent so much time with you all that I needed time with my other friends. Between us, we've had too much happen this year. I need a chill out group that I can get to know again. You know how at the beginning of friendships they always are all happy, it's only when you get to know a person too well that the unhappiness comes. I need that constant happiness right now. Sorry. I don't think I can deal with too much right now. This year has been the worst with the grape vine and I'm just too tired to deal with all that. I hate gossip and I wish that it was alive so that I could torture it and kill it.

      i  agree with josh it would be nice if you would pronounce your typing a little better and not slur words together, take your time and form complete thoughts before you try to type.  and for goodness' sake at least force your partial thoughts to make sense.  oh and even though I respect Abby, if you try to use her name to win an argument against me you will end up losing that argument, trust me i'll find a way (because everybody knows where there's a Will, there's a way)

      It's nice to speak English every once in a while, Lil' Chi. :) heh.  Ummmmmmm.......I'm sure I could  easily  overtake and viciously rape all three of you  SIMULTANEOUSLY , with all those people around and all. My dad's gonna be there tho, and he's too cripled for rape, and if not him, my slightly gimp-ed mother will be there too. You should see my family assembled, me and and guts, which are killing me, my dad and his being sick and a born gimp, and my mom with her gray and blooded finger. And Katie. She'll probably be on her period and the motley crew will be even motlier. Er. Abby said so.  By the way guys, I have special permission to invoke the name of Abby every time I want to be right from now on, so if I use it to win a fight (and I will, trust me), I  WIN , since she of whom I speak has said that her word is natural mandate and thereby must be taken with the fullest of cares, thereby being respected, thereby meaning: BONUS, I WIN a lot more. God, what's wrong with my head? I blasted it on my headboard which I took down last weekend this morning and chipped a molar. And the blood! Good God! At least it's the end of the year. And I'm really sorry I said that, so I'm knocking the hell out of this wooden desk now.  That makes: me, Linds, Abby, Z, and my family...there's some Wharton and MLK people that are just going because it's the last day, and they'll probably stop me, but everyone's favourite person won't be there (in Australia tomorrow, I think), so it'll be ok.  Where'd you get all doze puns dood?  Word.

      I LOVE PUNS!!!  Here's some really funny ones.  If they're old, don't yell at me.  A man's home is his castle, in a manor of speaking.   Dijon vu -- the same mustard as before.   Practice safe eating -- always use condiments.   Shotgun wedding: A case of wife or death.   A man needs a mistress just to break the monogamy.   A hangover is the wrath of grapes.   Dancing cheek-to-cheek is really a form of floor play.   Sea captains don't like crew cuts.   Does the name Pavlov ring a bell?   Condoms should be used on every conceivable  occasion.   Reading while sunbathing makes you well-red.   When two egotists meet, it's an I for an I.   A bicycle can't stand on its own because it is two-tired.   What's the definition of a will? It's a dead giveaway.   Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.   A backward poet writes inverse.   In democracy your vote counts. In feudalism your count  votes.   She had a boyfriend with a wooden leg, but broke it off.   A chicken crossing the road is poultry in motion.   If you don't pay your exorcist, you get repossessed.   With her marriage, she got a new name and a dress.   Show me a piano falling down a mine shaft, and I'll  show you A  flat minor.   When a clock is hungry, it goes back four seconds.   The man who fell into an upholstery machine is fully  recovered.   A grenade thrown into a kitchen in France would result  in  Linoleum  Blownapart.   You feel stuck with your debt if you can't budge it.   Local Area Network in Australia: the LAN down under.   He often broke into song because he couldn't find the  key.   Every calendar's days are numbered.   A lot of money is tainted. It taint yours and it taint mine.   A boiled egg in the morning is hard to beat.   He had a photographic memory that was never  developed.   A plateau is a high form of flattery.   The short fortuneteller who escaped from prison was a  small  medium at large.   Those who get too big for their britches will be exposed  in the  end.   Once you've seen one shopping center, you've seen a  mall.   Those who jump off a Paris bridge are in Seine.   When an actress saw her first strands of gray hair, she  thought  she'd dye.   Bakers trade bread recipes on a knead-to-know basis.   Santa's helpers are subordinate clauses.   Acupuncture is a jab well done.   Marathon runners with bad footwear suffer the agony of  defeat.

      That's not true!  When you're in my room you clean unconsciously I do believe!!!  But yeah, everyone knows how much I clean.  Not much.  I let Lori take care of that.  I just kind of throw things in drawers so she can clean around me.  I'm excited about Ren Fest.  And Josh, you might want to bring another guy along.  Liz, Abby, and I may be able to overtake you and rape you ;) Well, the opposite is what my mother thinks, so why not?  Seriously though, if you don't want to hang out with just us girls, we don't mind another guy.

      I think I'm going Monday, I just need times and stuff.  Yeh...from what I know of Becca, she is really moody.  Don't take anything with her too personally.  By the way, I don't clean anything that isn't located in my bedroom, so sorry, but not a chance.  It's summer for me!  Boy howdy!  Anyway...yeh.

      Okay, dropping a bomb there, Rosie?  I kind of agree with Linds.  I mean, I certainly hope she's not suicidal.  I wouldn't want to hear that about anyone.  I might be acting bitter, biased, or just plain bitchy, but she brought this on herself.  Really.  And with all the AP's she's taking next year, I wouldn't be that surprised if she started feeling like that.  That's why I'm never taking that many AP's.  So if she mopes about it, she can get over it.  I am really sorry if that offends anyone or makes them think ill of me, but that's how I feel and you know that normally I'm pretty blunt.  I'm in one of those antagonistic, vindictive moods tonight.    Anyway, is it okay if I come with you guys to Renfest, Linds and Josh and aren't you going, Abby?  Linds I know doesn't have a problem.  I will need a ride, though.  If that's cool, fine, and if not, fine.  I'm going on Sunday anyway, so... ;)  But I would like to come with you guys.  I know we'd have a good time.    As for the cleaning thing...I don't ever do that...;)  ~Z

      actually how about you come to my room Abby. My mom has declared that since I get out early tomorrow I just have to clean my room and get it back the usual spotlessness. So if you just want to do all that you did today over, come one over =). I hate cleaning but I'm kinda like you. I'll go like a week where I clean the whole house and it all started with cleaning out my desk. Maybe my mom is trying to get me to clean the whole house since we have company this weekend. *shrugs* who knows. Anyway I'm prolly going to renfest on monday but i'm going to be with jacob and them with becca. She's been feeling low so i want to cheer her up and I know how you all dislike her. Sorry guys....I'm not choosing her over you at all...i just can't stand her moping. I'm still you alls friend and any other day I would choose you all but becca is....worrying me. You know how brittany said that josh was in the hospital due to suicide...i'm thinking that depressed for becca.k b ye

Well, I kinda ended up not only cleaning my backpack out, but I also organized my closet, cleaning out my desk and organizing under my sink in my bathroom.  I think that I'm obsessed.  Help me, please.  How are your exams going?

      So, I think that Josh has a new phrase.  Anyway, guess what?  I have an 85 in math, when I thought I had a 76!  I'm very happy, of course, thats without the exam factored in.  Aw...I just made myself depressed.  I hate exams.  A lot.  They are stressful.  I don't like stress.  I kinda go insane, as Linds will tell you.  And now you're thinking "when wasn't she insane?"  Haha,  very funny, well I'm one step ahead of you...ok, well, I'm not.  And now that I've confirmed your first thoughts, let's move on.  2 down, 3 to go...then SUMMER!!!!!

      Howdy buddies.  Nobody posting on the BLog? Amazing.  Someone has to have a problem or something random to say, right?  Well,  I'll  do it then. My dad is starting to screw around with his old girlfriend again, and  epiglottical tongue suture with a cranberry wax sauce . Problem and random thing. I have gone insanely mad with madness. Forgive this slightly odd post, but the strangeness of the emptiness of the BLogness is totalling my last semblances of normality.

Always nice to have more company on the lonely ol' BLog.  (note to this post: Megan posted before this one but it never showed up on the message queue (that white box) below; this is just  The BLog  being gay and deleting first posts again...but I swear I'm not crazy, she really did post something!)

Rosie what do you think he isn't telling you?  would you really like him to tell you everything?  trust me thats not what you want.  so if you want to find out something ask a pointed question not a broad query.  linds ive got to see the hair.

      Thanks again all...I posted this in my BLog, but I thought I should come here and say it...thanks for the well-wishes, being sixteen is awesome.   ABBY, I'm going to post it tomorrow. And thanks for the hand, in a manner of speaking. I just recorded a new song and I was gripping the hand in frustration because I couldn't get those damn vocals right again and again. Don't worry, I didn't break it, if it even bent out of place a bit I frantically put it to a side and beat the holy hell out of my head with the hardest and closest object possible for even thinking of defying the holy relic. Once again, I am done. Maybe I should start talking to my psychiatrist about my limb fetish? Wait...what psychiatrist?  LINDSEY,  I want to see your hair dude, that's amazing. Thanks for the song!  ROSIE, thanks for the birthday wishes both on the phone and here, despite your one-track mind about me not telling you something. God, I don't know what you want me to say. I'm pregnant? There you go. I'm pregnant. "Hello fetus, when you're ready, come out and meetus." Heh, I heard that on TV today from some guy talking to his baby in his wife's stomach. It was really funny at the time. And you won't find it, so NAH. Jeez, jez hold on to yer britches for another week or so and I'll pull the fish out of the water, 'k?  WILL, thanks for the HBD on  Antiphilanthrophy , very surprised to see anyone on there. Hope your summer is going great.  That's it for now people. I said I was going to have a party tomorrow but I lied. Too much organization that I haven't done yet. But I'll try to put it together again sometime later...maybe when everyone could be there, that would be nice. Jeez, you hit "lazy season" and everyone is parting to the four corners of the earth. What happened to the "lazy" in summer vacation? Hey, I don't do anything, and from my perspective,  YOU  shouldn't be doing anything either.  One more thing...I was thinking...I can take my songs and put them in WMA format and send them through the 'net, so there's no more hassle of CDs...but that would take space and time to get into your inboxes, and in the case of Rosie and Will, with the dialups and such, practically impossible. I just thought I would put that on the table and see what everyone thought of it.  G'bye friends.

      Happy birthday Josh!  I hope you have a good one, which I'm sure you will because you have my hand.  Anyway, I'll call you Linds on Monday.  I'm annoyed, but not.  Because my family is going to Eurpoe the day after home concert.  Yay!...But I won't be getting back until a week before my school starts.  Which means, I will have NO SUMMER AT HOME.  Seriously, I've done the calculations.  I had this week, I have next week.  Then I'm going on a beach retreat, camp and a mission trip.  Literally hours at home between those.  Then I have a week at home and off to Lake Junaleska (or however you spell it).  Then practice for choir tour, and choir tour.  Then Eurpoe and school.  Thats what?  4 weeks at home?  Boy howdy....and most of this stuff I don't really want to go too (not the stuff with you, Linds, the other stuff).  Well, off I go.  I'll talk to you guys on Sunday, or Monday...or something.  I don't know.  Whatever.    Happy birthday again!  Btw, I want to hear my song...haha.  Germs, my invisible dog is a song that I saw performed by a bunch of really cute little kids.

      I was thinking about that quote just a couple of days ago, Liz.  Adam was talking about how he didn't like the "el", which for those of you not familiar to the Chicago area, is the "elevated train" much like a subway, only above ground for the most part.  Anyway, so that made me think of it.  Oh, and *clears throat* *bursts into song*  Happy birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday dear Jo-osh Happy Birthday to You!!!  OK, never again.  I have fully lost all semblance of sanity and it's all the stupid summer's fault.  Grrrr...  Call me.  I'm serious.  I don't beg unless it is a real emergency.  Which this is, no doubt.

      Excellent, I'm glad to see that no one has lost their psychotic flair or penchant for randomness. The BLog has remained true to its intentions.  Welcome back Will, there hasn't been any good olde-fashionede Will cynicism in a long while it seems like...we were going to break down and cry. Well, I was going to anyway.  It's my birthday as of now. Happy me.

      Hey, Will!  Glad to see that you're back.  Didn't know you were going to Georgia but now that I think about it, it doesn't surprise me.  Good job on the barking.  ;) I promise to call you tomorrow, Linds.  What's with the "Germs, my invisible dog" thing?  Just curious.  I have a random quote that Lindsey should know.  "I wonder why people hate public transit."  ;)  'Member that one?  Boy howdy, is Vegas coming up quickly. *rubbing it in for Lil' China's sake*  Clothes packed today.  Grrr...more stuff to come.  Daddy Dearest just can't wait, apparently.  Good thing is that I finally get to wear this dress (whole group of people reading this gasp simultaneously...yes, a dress) that's been in my closet for eons.  It's REALLY cool, for the girls who care and even for the guys who don't.  Anyway, getting late...or something, so I'd better go.  Talk to you guys later.  ~Z

And Wal-Mart!!! We've got to quit missing each other!!! Grrr...  Anyway, people, I demand that you call me this week.  I won't be home until Next Sunday.  Not like 2 days from now sunday, but the sunday after that.  473-2890.  Screw the stupid psycho-killers who might get this number.  CALL ME!!!! I'm BEGGING you!!! PLEASE!!!

I don't think I will be able to catch up that quickly when I get back, but you never know.  Can't wait until tomorrow.  Wahoo!  Boy howdy!  Whoopie-ding!  Neato mosquito man!  Whoop-di-doo!  Ok, I can't think of any more really cheesy phrases that express sarcasm, so I'll stop now.  Anyway..find some more random quotes, Linds.  I'm ordering you to.

      No, close, but no.  "When I feel sad, I let my tears flow out like a Coca-Cola bottle when you shake it up" is the exact quote.  You definately need to come with us next year.  I think that Will is in Georgia or someplace like that...I don't know, I think thats what Josh said in an earlier post.  Anyway, so, I've already done all the things I needed to do today, so I'm really bored now, but what else is new?  Linds, I called some hair places and there were two places that sounded pretty good; Heads Up and Ben's Salontique.  So, hopefully I can get my hair done sometime really really soon.  Man, I am not looking forward to this weekend.  2 days of people critiquing me is not what I find enjoyable.  My aunt is so judgemental.  She and I don't really get along because she is always telling me what I've done wrong and you guys know how I am.  I am NEVER wrong.  So, yeh, this should be fun.  At least my cousins will be there...not that they are much help, but they are still really cool.    Isn't "boy howdy" the funnest phrase to say?  You can use it to express pretty much any emotion and people laugh when you say it.  I love it and I think that goes for Josh too, from what I've heard.    Germs, my invisible dog.

      Abby, you have made me realize that I really like the expression "boy howdy."  So cool!  Guys, whether you want me or not, I am definitely coming to Renfest with you next year.  Sounds like you had a blast.  Doubt that any of you could see me as a wench (go wenches!) or fairy or other mystical creature, but you have all seen me do the "Bend and Snap," so I suppose miracles can happen.  I will try to remember to call ya, Linds.  Wondered why I hadn't heard from you for a while.  By the way, has anyone seen/heard from Will?  He seems to have been absent from this Blog lately.  Packing for my Vegas trip tomorrow...enough said.  ANYway, better go, but when you see what time I posted you will most definitely realize that I have become a summer night owl.  Au revoir, all.   ~Z

      Yay!  I don't even really know if he's coming or not.  I have to talk to my grand-parents, which can be...interesting, to say the least...just ask Linds, she knows them.  And I want to see the song...this should be interesting.  If you're not going to post it, at least e-mail it to me or something.    So, today was super fun.  I enjoy hospitals and waiting rooms and needles and coloring books.  (Sarcasm, for the slower ones...)  Anyway, people call me tomorrow, please.  I can already tell that I'm going to be majorly bored cause my mom will be at Habitat, and my dad at work and my sis at school/work.  So, I'm going to be calling a bunch of hair salons and making little button faces all day long!!!!  Boy howdy, I CANNOT wait!

      In reply to Abby:  And boy howdy, I shall do it, if necessary, what with my foot fetish and all. I wrote your song by the way, about the Easy Bake Oven, it's called  EBAMahickey ...it's really random, and I'll post it at some point. Just imagine a song glorifying the immense burning power of an EBA/making fun of it, and that's the song. And it's really random. Like, really. But back to the main point, I shall "hang" with said "cousin".

      I'll call you this afternoon, but I have to take my mom to a doctor's appointment, then run a few errands to the grocery and stuff, so I'll call you around one or two or so.  And thanks to everyone for getting back on the blog.  Makes my life a lot more enjoyable.

      ok linds, what part of CALL ME do you not understand. I need to talk to someone.....like....hmmmm....maybe you? Josh....it's good that we kinda talked that out and which path are you taking......the xi path or your very own path of actually continuing to be my friend.....that would be nice. Anyway save me everyone....i suffer that ailment that Abby suffers, boredom though an interesting convers which phil cured that for like 45min. It's amazing what two bored people find to talk about.......not kidding. Anyway i was trying to reach those at renfest. You know those fairy wands with glitter in them...well lets just say that rosie was a sheet of glitter at the end of renfest....but i got everyone one first and they were worse that I. Only problem with all that is I STILL have glitter on me.....great Yes Z i know my grammar in this post was awful....i don't care cuz school is out and the AP essay is being pushed back by me. ok time for bye bye all -rosie

      "So times infinite!"  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!  I win!    Anyway, Ren Fest was lots and lots of fun.  We decided to rent costumes and Linds and I were wenches and Josh wore a kilt.  That was great. We kinda wandered around.  Linds and I got a turkey leg, which Rosie saw us eating cause she came over and talked to us (nice meeting you, by the way).  Um...I guess after that we went to the wax hands dude and we did my hand.  Josh thought I was suffering and all....it wasn't bad at all, I have no idea why he thought it was painful.  Um, then we went to the joust which was SUPER fun!  Boy howdy...anyway...after that, I think we just sat down in that grassy area and talked for a really really really long time, during which I became very badly sunburned on my shoulders, which goes to show that off the shoulder is not always the best look.  Oh well.  Then we went out to eat at T.G.I. Friday's.  Dinner was very good.  Thank your mother for me again.   So, yeh.  It really sucks when you have a ton of things to do in the day, but you are done with them by 10:30 in the morning.  Then you get to sit around the house for the rest of the day doing nothing and being incredibly bored.  Until, of course, you call Lindsey and talk to her. Yup, that was my day today.  Don't you wish you had my life?  Oh, yeh, I also get to go out of town this weekend.  Which really sucks. I thought I had made it fairly clear to my parents that I didn't want to go this weekend.  Its a family reunion of sorts.  We're going to someplace in Kentucky.  Man, this weekend is going to suck.  A lot.  Oh well.  It'll be a good time to suck up to my cousin who is working on a movie with some famous director (who he will not to tell me the name).  And, yeh.  Can't wait.  Oh, Josh.  My cousin could possibly be coming to spend some of the summer here, with my grand parents.  He will go insane if he just hangs out with them.  Could you possibly do stuff with him?  I'm kinda worried about how he'll act and what he'll do while here, which is why I need a "good" influence. (Haha).  He's 15, so its not like babysitting or anything.  I would really appreciate it if you would do this and so would the rest of my family.  I might even give you a waxed foot in return.  Boy howdy, what a gift.

      Whoa.  I was looking at MSN and they had a list of the top, like 500 schools in America.  And keep in mind that there are over 1000 schools just in Tennessee.  BHS was ranked #298.  So multiply 1000 times 50, plus and extra like 2000 schools for Texas and California.  That means that we're 298/54000ish.  Which means BHS is in the top 5% of U.S. schools, meaning SCHOLARSHIPS!!!!  Not only that, but we were the only Tennessee school, both public and private, on the list.  I think that means YAY BHS!!!  and I'm not exactly one for school spirit either.  I went and borrowed all the books we're supposed to read for AP from the library.  Have I started on them?  No way, I''m not that motivated.  Anyway, I'm going to my grandmother's house to try to help calm my cousin down a bit about this baby thing.  Or at least help her realize that she really  is  having a baby.  I don't think it's fully sunk in yet.  But it should be fun...er, interesting.  I'll still be on the blog and on my e-mail and stuff though, so nothing should be changing, but if you need me, call my cell, and if you don't have the cell, then call Abby or Liz and they'll tell you cause I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving my phone number out on the internet.  Anyway, um, that's about it.  I sat on my bum today and did a whole bunch of nothing, so there isn't anything else to say.  I'll let you know when something interesting happens.  Someone get in a fight or something so I can at least be entertained for a while.  I need entertaining badly.  Ok, that's it, it's movie night, so I gotta go.  It's Whit's night to pick, so it could be interesting...

      Sounds like you guys had a great time.  Sorry I missed it, really.  Got stuck with Dad all afternoon...sigh.  Still can't get my point across that I don't want to spend every minute with him, since I've never had that problem before.  Anyway, I want details on what you all did.  I had a great time with my cousin Gael and her friend.  He was so funny.  His name was Joel, or Joe L., or something.  Sounds like Joe L. but I have no idea how he spells it.  They went to college together.  But I doubt that you all care about any of this, so I will close.  SO glad to be out of school.  ~Z

      Yeh, I really hope that it doesn't rain tomorrow.  Of course we'll let you go next year...I think...I don't know, I guess that's not really my decision. Yeh, I'm excited.  And...yeah buddy, tomorrow's going to rock!    Yeh, so we went to FRA's graduation, and was it super fun!  Yeh, we got there and we sat down and we sat there and we sat there and then we got to do some more sitting.  But you know, we did get to stand once.  Yeh, at the end when all the seniors, excuse me graduated seniors, got up to leave, we had to give them a standing ovation and all.  Boy, was that fun or what.  Then I went around and introduced Linds to all my spiffy FRA friends...there was Brendan, Ian, Carmen, Dan, Mary-Catherine, Erica, Blake, Sasha...yeh, I think thats it.  There were other people there too, but I either don't know them or don't like them...more of the latter, I think.    Then we went back to my house and sat there...(I'm noticing a pattern) but then my mom wanted us to count how many pounds of food we got from the food drive at church.  Btw, I'm incharge of our churches food drive and after the services, we took all the food people brought, home.  My father thought it would be a really great idea if we measured how much we raised.  So he suggested that one of us stand on the bathroom scale while the other hands us food.  We then measure how much the scale reads and subtract persons weight from that number.  I thought "why do we have to stand on the scale?  Can't we just put the food on it?"  Besides, how much you want to bet that I would be the one on the scale?  So, all in all, we counted 1457 pounds of food this week, and 253 last week...totalling, drum roll please, 1700 pounds of canned and non-perishable food items, plus some open boxes of food and several cans of diet pepsi (which in my mind doesn't really count) and 1 bucket of laundry detergent.  Yeh, whoever brought the detergent is a complete and total idiot.    Well, that was a fun story.  I'm glad I told it, and so is Linds, cause she isn't paying any attention to what I'm writing.  She's playing backgammon with some Japanese guy.  (She told me not to tell you thats she's losing..."I'm not losing too bad.  Pretty bad, but not too bad." (That's a direct quote.)

      Yeah.  I can't go tomorrow, all.  But I went today and it was FUN!  Even though it rained.  Perhaps I will go with you next year if you'll let me.  A thousand people were dressed up.  It wasn't crowded.  The castle is cool, although kind of small.  Oh, and admission is $14, not $13.  Not a huge difference but might be to some people.  ANYWAY, have a good time, all and I will be there in spirit.  ~Z

      Hey, Abby and Lindsey here.  We're bored.  We're looking up how to speak Elizabethean.  It's quite nice, actually.  Thou flea-bitten bladder.  That's one of the insults we learned.  Hmmm, yeah, well, you're only taking me (Lindsey) and Abby tomorrow.  She has left over cookies in return for the ride.  They are VERY good.  Gaddis said Abby was his hero, and Romeo said she was the Messiah.  Yeah, like we didn't already know that.  Anyway, I'm sure Rosie appreciates the directions, given that she's NEVER on the blog anymore, nor is anyone else for that matter.  It's now the Lindsey-Josh-Abby website.  *Sigh*  Sadness (stolen from Abby, very sorry)

      Hey people.  Some people wanted some directions, so here it is the best I know. At Concord, get on the interstate and head south towards the Franklin exit, which is where you'll be getting off. Take a left off of the onramp, and you'll be on 96. Just keep going down thataway until you hit a hellacious amount of signs for the Tennessee Renaissance Festival, or if you see the sign for Newcastle Road, but it's a bit small, and blue if I recall. Then just go down the road til you hit a bunch of freaks in Renaissance clothing waving flags towards the parking area, and BLAM, there you are. Or you could go to  urlLink MapQuest  if you don't entirely trust me and type in the address there, which is 2124 New Castle Road, Arrington-Triune, TN...the zip code really doesn't really matter if it asks. OR, better yet, you could go to  urlLink the Tennessee Renaissance festival website , which is a direct map to the place. There you go.  Sweet. Whoall am I taking, goshgolly?

      Parents suck.  Here's my beautiful story that Abby already knows.  Ok, Abby wanted me to go with her to FRA's graduation.  So I ask my mom, and she comes up with at least ten different excuses for me not to go, including "You need to be at choir on time" (there is no choir today), "You're not using a nice tone of voice", (I said, 'mom, may I please go to FRA's graduation with Abby?'), "You've been treating me like a dog for more than two weeks (yeah, which is why I've done all the laundry, all the dishes, and aced all my exams),  "I don't want to take you" (Abby's taking me), and it all ended with "I get why you want to go anyway" (Um, to get out of the house, mainly, and so I can meet Abby's school friends).  So finally she says, "Ok, but you have to clean the basement before you go."  The basement was already really clean, so I took the vacuum cleaner down there and vacuumed the entire playroom and cleanedd out the closet.  So my mom asks my dad to come inspect to make sure I actually did what I was supposed to, and lo and behold, if there wasn't a popcorn kernal on the floor, meaning, of course, that I needed to clean the  entire  floor all over again.  So I vacuum.  Again.  Dad comes to inspect.  This time there is "baseboard dust"  I'm serious.  That's a quote.  What the hell is "baseboard dust"?  So anyway, I clean all that up.  Never quite knew what it was i was cleaning, but apparently I did ok on it.  So dad comes to inspect again.  Apparently I hadn't cleaned well enough under the foosball table. So I did that.  He comes back to inspect (you'd think that he's get tired of running up and down the stairs) and this time he's satisfied with the playroom, but now he wants me to vacuum the rest of the basement.  So I vacuum.  More baseboard dust, more worms, more popcorn kernals, blah blah blah.  So finally, after about 15 insepctions (by this time I'm feeling like an Iraqui) I finally have permission to go to graduation, and my mom is NOT happy.  I can't wait for Ren Fest.  One day of freedom.  Then on Saturday I'm going to AL to visit my grandmother and cousin, but then I have to go to Auburn with my family.  Not that I don't like Auburn, I love it as a matter of fact, but my mom...it's not going to be a fun ride.  I miss yall so much.  I miss school.  I just want things to be like they were about 4 weeks ago.  THings were a lot less complicated then...*sigh*

      Hey can anyone sew well here? You know how you all spent "tons" of money of renting renfest costumes? Well I found this site where they have patterns and stuff so if one us can sew...we can garb ourselves at a lower cost....since we don't want nobility style either I'm guessing. Just a thought....I'm bored. You guys know how I said I never get sunburn...well I did and now tanktops are my best friends.....wow i hate sunburns and this one isn't as bad as Sarah's. She can't move without pain and if Gavin so much and tries to give her a hug...she isn't too kind to him. anyway see yall

      Um, well, I would respond but there are no other posts, so yeh.  Funny how out of the 5 posts, 4 of them are mine, the other is a really short message from Rosie.   I have a hat, Josh, that you would enjoy, I think, quite a bit.  It's a duck.  With glasses.  I named it Zoolof.  And today has been fairly good. No evil people trying to kill me...yet.  But we do have people (the Batsons, Linds...wahoo), that I don't really enjoy.  Oh well...maybe I can go out to dinner with my sis or something.   Well, I'm off to Florida-land.  I'm kinda annoyed because Kyndall checked the weather, and it's supposed to rain the ENTIRE time I will be there.  Which kinda defeats the purpose of a beach retreat.  I'm almost done packing....just the stuff for the 10-hour bus ride left.  This is going to be interesting.  TJ and Scott aren't riding in the bus and they are the two people who will actually make it fun.  I actually have to be social.  YUCK!!!!  I will talk to you guys again, I guess on Friday/Saturday...depends on when I get back.    Don't forget.  Satuday, Baskin Robins, Noon.

      Wow, I must say that that is a really random song list, but I love them all.  This party, even though it's in like, 3 months, is going to be awesome.  I CANNOT WAIT!!!!  What should I be?  I'm thinkin like a princess or something, but thats always what I am.  I need suggestions.  Hum...Strawberry Shortcake?  That would be cool.  Perhaps Dorothy?  No, that's way too over done.  Maybe a chef?  Oh, wait, what's the point in dressing up?  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  I got it.  What about my Aunt Stephanie?  Then I could act like her, and make fun of myself and my party as much as I want.  But that would also mean not letting Josh play.  No, that won't work.  I think this calls for a trip to Joann's.  Or my costume box.  Or Performance.  Hummmm..shopping here I come!!  Well, yeh, I need advice also on what sorts of food items and games should be there.  For the people who care, I'm going to have a kinda "Blast from the Past" costume party.  Meaning foods and games that we played as little kids.  They are just going to be set up around the area, so that people can go over and start playing.  I already have a long list of stuff made by me and Josh, but we could go for some others.  Would you like the list?  Ok, here it is:   Food  Pigs "n" Blankets Puppy Chow The animal crackers things with the frosting stuff on top that are really good when you heat them up a little in the microwave Ants on a Log (Just for you, Josh) Gummy Bears Teddy Grahams (How do you spell that?) Kudos  String Cheese (That might be a little gross after sitting on the refreshment table with no refridgeration, but I'll work something out) Ritz Bitz (both cheese and peanut butter) Toasty Crackers And any others that you guys might think of... Plus the birthday cakes that I am going to make no matter what you say, Josh   Games  Finger painting Blopens Hula Hoops Various Bored Games Hopscotch Jump rope Skip it Any other suggestions??  Well, have fun practicing and tell me how it goes.  I'm sure it'll be interesting. Meanwhile, I get to sit here at home playing the piano because there is nothing else to do in this stupid house.

      *laughing*  I think we've got that sorted out. YOU SAW THE ONE-ARMED MAN! Didn't that just make your day in itself? But as for the driver's testing lady...you have to understand, she's an underpaid and hated state employee. Which, of course, gives you all the right to do as you did, but also makes her all the more pissy. Kill her next time, no one will care. Heh.  And now, the illustrious songlist....at least, what's being put into consideration.......for Abby's party. This is really rich, guys, I have to post it or I will blow up.  Beatles Stuff    Michelle    Help    Strawberry Fields Forever    Yesterday    Here Comes The Sun    Day Tripper    Can't Buy Me Love (I guess that's the name?

      Ok, Linds.  I did not forget about you.  I was going to call you on Monday, like I promised.  Thats when you told me to call you, remember???  And I called you after that too, remember???  Anyway, I'm sorry that Alabama wasn't much fun.  Relatives suck, don't they?  Liz, it's nice that your back.  I had no idea where you went in the first place.  But, hi.  Josh, I'm not limiting your coke intake today.  I told you that, like, 6 times.  Your phone sucks.  Get a new one.  So, I went to the library today, and got this book about birthday cakes.  You should see them.  They are amazing.  I'm going to make one for my party...still a while from now, but I need to choose one.  All of the pictures look like...I don't know how to describe it, but I don't know, like, they were drawn, that they aren't an actual edible thing.  So, yeh, if that makes any sense at all.    It's an ardvark-eat-turtle world.

      Interesting that you would post as such when you called me. And woke me up.  People, let's really think this one out for a minute. I'm 16. I don't have a job. It's summer. When would you expect that such a person would be awake and functioning? Say...7, right? 9, maybe? TRY 1 OR TWO....IN THE EVENING. So you should have seen the stupefied look on my face as the phone rang at 9 and 1/2 this morning, and I was sleeping there, thinking to myself..."That's the phone, isn't it? Man, I don't care. I'll pick it up if it's still ringing in a few hours." But then rationality crept in and, tripping over every available tripper in the house. I managed to get to the phone as it stopped ringing. I hate cellphones.  Abby would know this, as well. Not only did my phone suffer a 30:32 last night, it also went out due to one lightning strike, and eventually died because the power being pumped into it by the PLUG IN THE WALL was not enough to sustain the dying battery for a phone call. So I just gave up and called the phone a suckhead and cried. Heheh. I get to beat up lots of people tho, in the next coming weeks. Life is shaping up to be a bundle of roses.  I've had one Wild Cherry (doesn't that count as a fruit?) Pepsi as of this morning, and as I sank back into a caffeine-depraved drowse last night, I could feel myself dying for the next morning so as to have one. These things are like cigs. I LOVE CAFFEINE. There's no animosity towards that stuff at all. I just love it. loveitloveitloveit   SIN CITY , BONUS!  God in heav'n, the BLog is repopulated, you must love me.

      Josh, happy late birthday.  And the random cranberry wax sauce thing was very cool.  Sorry, but I've been in VEGAS, baby, yeah!  WOOO.  Even if it was with Daddy Dearest.  I believe that that is how I shall refer to him from this point forward.  Hey, at least he bought me stuff.  Linds, I just happened not to have my cell on at that moment when you called...and who had to call twenty times before she spoke to a real person and not voicemail?  Who?  Who?  Anyone?  Was it Liz?  Yep, that's right.  ;)  Just kidding.  Glad everything was cool with your cousins, and sorry to hear that you made everyone mad and that you left your cell phone there.  And you neglected to tell me that you CUT your HAIR.  YOU.  LINDS.  MS. "I DON'T CUT MY HAIR" GIRL.  So...anyway, enough with the caps.  A big enthusiastic hello to everyone.  Thanks for the info on the dog song, Abby.  Hope everyone else is having a bearable summer so far and unfortunately now it is time for everyone's favorite letter (Z) to leave this forum.  Valete!  ~Z

      Well, I'm back home early because Alabama sucks and I made everyone mad at me, basically, and I'm seriously doubting that Meg ever gets back on here, sort of like Jackie, so I don't care if she sees that.  Um, oh yeah.  Thanks for the calls yall...*cough cough* and a very true thanks to both Abby and Liz, even though I had to call and remind them to call me. Oh well, that's the way life goes.  I'm just glad to be home.  I hate Alabama.  And I left my cell phone there.  Grrr.  Maybe I'll be happier next time I post.

      Hahahahahahahahahah.  You have absolutely no idea how hard I'm laughing right now.  Man, you should have heard my end of the conversation.  I was just kinda sitting there for 5 minutes wondering "humm....there's nothing on the other end of the line.  What should I do?" Yeh, but it was a good thing you didn't call back.  My mother came in "check" on me like 10 minutes later.  She would have been pissed if I was still talking.  How are the cokes going?  Obviously you must not have gotten bored yet, or else I would be getting a lovely little phone call....or have you been bored and decided to have a coke anyway?    Wow, Travis really was catch, wasn't he?  Can't wait for mission trip, where I get to spend a WHOLE week with him and his cousin!!!  Boy howdy, that'll be fun.   So, my weekend sucked for the people who didn't know that already.  I'm not really going to go into any details. You can get them all from Josh or Linds.  Where is everyone?

      HEYA ABBY  Sorry for like, hanging up like that...my phone has 30:32 syndrome...the time is really messed up on it, and it like to skip around and do really random stuff. But everytime it hits 30:32 it cuts the call, no matter what. And I didn't call back because of how late it was...didn't want your parents to cut your head off or anything.  But it was so incredibly hilarious and random, and I was quite pissed to hear the dead air in the phone when it decided to die....   ...especially from one friend who is being really random... (laugh) Yeah...he.... Hello? Hello?   But o well, you were probably ready to quit anyway, n'est-ce pas? I'll try the three cokes deal...but I dunno. And your birthday is going to be awesome so no worries. And just think of all the fun you'll have this summer. Hehehehe.  Travis is awesome. Pardon me while I stop the river of tears that last statement just caused.

      you all know how happy I was when I heard I got a full scholarship..well...they didn't tell me that there were like levels of full scholarship and I didn't get the 1st level. I got all the History, Theory, and Acompanying lessons covered but my private lessons are only half covered 30min,....*whine* and that's the 2nd level, the 1st level would have gotten 45 min covered so the full scholarship 1st level still wouldn't have covered everything..why do I feel like killing the wording of full scholarship. Anyway this was a huge dissapointment so...no one talk about piano awhile. on the good note there were only 11 scholarships for all levels and I got 2nd...that's ok but still I should have gotten 1st..i should have practiced more....linds we should talk considering you're hte only one that cares about piano

Will...check your e-mail.  Josh...you'll survive. Linds...We'll be in touch and I think a girl's night is due...sometime when I get un-grounded... Zabeth...where are you, I think on the blog you would be considered as dead... how's daddy dearest....(sarcasm btw so don't shoot me)  to the girls....are you up for 2 fast 2 furious...i so so so so so so want to see it but not with gunter or anyother guy so...ya

Well, yeh.  Thanks again.  Wait, what about a movie?  I'm guessing that you went to a movie during the course of the week?  Gone with the Wind rocks!  I love it!!!  I guess it's ok if Alex comes in something other than a kilt.  Well, I'm really really really really really really really really really really really tired. I stayed up until 4 this morning and got up again at 7.  Then I got to ride a bus for 10 hours...on which it was impossible to sleep.  So, yeh, it was fun.  Anyway, I'm glad Auburn was fun, Linds.  I know you didn't want to go.  I think that...ok, I totally forgot what I was going to say.  I'm way too tired.  I'm just kinda sitting here in a daze, knowing that I still have so much to do.  I need to go, I can't really see anything anymore.  That's not too good.  I'll tell you all, maybe, about my week later.

      Rosie, that anecdote actually allowed my mind to focus on something else other than my problems.  Life has sucked, lately.  As we all know, my dad is such a bastard.  This weekend WOULD have been their 24th anniversary.  Mom was kind of down, so we went to a movie last night.  In case anyone's interested, The Italian Job is REALLY good.  Action, humor (big time) and a plot!  So...anyway, I hate my dad right now, again.  I'm also in Driver's Ed, which is kinda rough, since today was my first time behind the wheel since at least before Les Mis, so...but I did all right, I think.  If I pass all of this, all I'll have to take is a vision test @ some county DMV (hopefully Davidson since Williamson's sucks so much) and then I will be license bound!  But it's still a little nervewracking and I want to thank you for your support, Will.  Linds, please call me when you can on my cell.  I'll check at breaks and call you back.  I need to talk to you about something.  I'll see the rest of you tomorrow @ Fridays.  I'm assuming we're going to walk over to Thoroughbred, right?  If not, call me on my cell (you guys should have the number) and leave me a voicemail.  Anyway, gotta go zzzzzzz so I will talk to you tomorrow.  See you then!  ~Z

OOHHH, you can't understand how amazing that is. I just had to stop typing so I could throw back my head and laugh and stop the tears from drowning me. O god. No offense against you or anything, Rosie, it's just the fact that he said.....................THAT!..............and being Chinese and little as he is.............THAT!  And why in the name of the good god who has bestowed your brother with the sacred phrase were you up at 6...you posted at a similar time in my BLog.  HAhahah, I'm going to die.

Josh you are not to mess with my family's head..! Kidding.....notice I'm up and dressed at 6:52 in the MORNING...there is something wrong with that...ya....but cross your fingers...i'm going to ask my mom if I can go tomorrow....sorry for the addition but i feel it's necessary. :-P

      Yeh, it is. And Stranglebox is coming in KILTZ! Woot! Except for Alex maybe, cuz he has to sit down and he really doesn't want everyone checking out his shit and all.  Lucy in the Sky, not a prob. The only prob is....learning these songs in the next few months, and actually getting to playing them all, bcuz we tend to flow a bit heavier with the majority of the songs...even with the joke songs like DIE and Cpt. Coodukx...so we won't know where to put them and not screw up the karma of the show...and believe me, there is a karma.  DID ABBY TELL YOU WHERE WE MIGHT BE HAVING IT? OH, SO EXCITING.  Have to go download  Still Fighting It  right now. Sorto scared. Hope it's not too hard.  Ok, big problem: where the f is everyone? Even on the other BLogs that I'm on, which used to get about a thousand posts a day...no one's there. The reaper of summer hath took his toll.  Now Will, we shouldn't make fun of Abby while she's go-abbyisincrediblyshort-ne, that wouldn't b-likealittlefreakingthreeyearold-e nice.  WOOT Auburn, BONUS. Hope it was every bit as amazing as it sounds to have been.  Abby said 50 some odd, but it might be up to 60, I dunno. But bonus.   Haha Rosie, HAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Suddenly, all the people that never get sunburned...ARE getting sunburned. Alex, for instance, that Jew never gets any UV penetration, AND HE COMES TO THE Y THE OTHER DAY AND THE FIRST THING I SAID WAS, "NICE CHERRY VARNISH THERE BLUSH." CUZ HE HAD A MASSIVE SUNBURN! WARHARHARHAHARHARHARHARHARHAR.  I love it,  I love it .

      Ok, I've been gone forever to Auburn, but I had a blast.  Anyway, no to the respondsing to the past 21 posts.  To individual people.  Josh:  Could we also add Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to the song list? Also, we're going to have some cds going so you can socialize and play Skip it.  Abby obviously talked to you if you know about the whole ben Folds Five thing, and all that, so that should all be taken care of.  We (me, you and abby, since we're the planners of this party) need to get together to plan this cause it's going to be huge.  I think we have almost 60 on the guest list right now.    Rosie:  This is me laughing at your sunburn.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!  Now you know what us fair skinn-ed people feel like. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  OK, I feel a bit better. as to the sewing thing, I'm going to sew me a costume, and Abby's mom will probably sew her one, but they're hard to make, as well as expensive, so neither of us will probably do anyone else's.  I may do josh a kilt, because it's so worth it.  And then...I'm right here, where are you?  OK, I think that's it for you.  NEXT!!!  Will:  God, I love you.  Your comment just made the whole day worthwhile.    Liz: Hi.  You didn't post whilst I have been gone, so I can't respond to you.  Abby:  I think I'm going to be Scarlet from Gone with the Wind.  I think that would be fun, though it might be kind of hard to maneuver in...hmmm.  I'm definitely thinking Strawberry Shortcake for you.  Um, and what's this Baskin Robbins thing on Saturday?  That sounds fun.  And um... yes, Josh will definitely love Zoolof.  I'm sorry I left you without telling, but I tried calling and no one was home, and I hate answering machines.  And... i think that's it, but I'm being rushed off the computer, so if I think of something else, I'll tell you.  Go read what I told Josh, and that should cover most everything I missed.

      YOU KNOW WHAT JUST MADE MY DAY TODAY?  Phil is in bed and has been for the past 2 days becuase of an ear infection....hehe.  OK, so it sounds cruel to laugh at him but it was so funny!  I let that kid organize something for once (for our sunday school group) and he told me Sunday that he would tell me the time after his baseball practice Sunday night. SO, On Monday when I heard about Lindsey's mom and that she need Josh's number I called his house and his mom picked up and said that he would get back later.....so I figured that he was either out with Jill or more likely at Baseball practice for the upteenth time. SO I call him Tuesday to tell him that Linds's mom is ok and that he better call me or A.I'm going to think he's dead or B. He just accidently forgot that he's supposed to be planning this get together...either way he's already in trouble. I'm not patient...well not alot and it didn't help that I had Jessica going in the other ear "When are we meeting, Where, What day, What time again?" it sucked. Anyway I finally got to him today and it turns out the kid has been in bed sick...it was just too funny... he was to plan something for the first time and he gets sick...of course I was the friend that laughed but wished him to get well soon....AND he's got to get well to go to our summer camp Undone (with our church)(I'll be in on of the 8 colleges I chose to see) and CentreKid to be a helper....he's gotta get well FAST...so he basicalliy chose the worst week to be sick and it was FUNNY.  Ok so I'm a little mean. :-P  Rosie

      Well, for even more pleasant news, the blood clot runs all the way from her bikini line down past her knee.  Too make thing seven better, we just found out that if she had missed her doctor's appointment and gone on the cruise, she would have died, not could haven, but most probably would have died because it would have broken loose and gone straight to her heart.  And if it breaks loose now, which it shouldn't, knock on wood, she could die.  So I'm in a lovely situation here.  I played my piano for hours tonight, and I don't think I've quit crying yet.  I was a week away from not having a mommy anymore...

And I tried calling Abby but her phone is off as usual...not much reception to be had in Fumbuck anywayz...  Agh.  Agh.   How is all of this happening...    "kablam" says my head

      hey if Zabeth gets on: Lindsey's mom is in the hospital because she has a blood clot in her leg that is making its way up to the lungs so her mom's spending the night in the hospital. If you want to reach Lindsey call her cell, she's kinda switching between ok and not ok.

      Well that could be awesome...  The problem is, I can't find any good guitarist that wants to play this show, even if they are temporary...  The first one is now our sound guy, he didn't want to play in front of people, but he's awesome with sound works, and his dad is a big and famous session musician...so says the lady in Vintage on Bridge Street in Downtown Franklin.  And then there was JH and he decided he's too good for us and that he already has a band...tho Linds informs me that the "band" is more of a Nazareth-like cover band. So screw that plan.  I don't want Matt Leper because he's what we all call a "pecker"...too out there, won't stay on task, too much of a showoff, etc. ...  I don't know anyone else besides that. If this Phillip can jam and plays heavy stuff and wouldn't mind playing everything from Beatles to Bal Sagoth, we're willing to give him a try.

      har har Spider eh...  Well I won't tell him he's great, mostly cuz it's the position of the band to make fun of "rock" keyboard players unless it's in harmonic death metal, and that still warrants a chuckle.   Dark? That's awesome. Yes, you have daresaid.  Can he play the guitar? Now that we've lost JH and all.

      Hey linds, it's been awhile since i've heard from you but I might be going to see bruce almighty...you might want to tag along but you would only know like one person that's going except me..so it's up to you,  also I have somethings to talk to you about that the whole world doesn't need to know, I tried to call but it said tat your line was disconnected so....ya call me...apparently I can't reach you...btw I feel like something is wrong with the world....don't ask why it's just like a  feeling   Josh there's this guy that you should meet....reallly! He's one of the people that I've known for forever and a day, we went to chinese school together when we were like 5. Anyway he just joined this band to fool around and stuff but he's like their main singer and keyboarder and other random stuff...i bow down to this guys musical talents...just don't tell him that...he gets cocky, Anyway you two are like....alike but he's more comedian and less...dare I say dark. Anyway I think you could be a good influence on him and maybe help him on......he's like 5 months younger than me so...you could be like a big brother......his name is Phillip and he's asian...so yes he's s spider. =) gtg byebye

      Um. You guys...well, what's left of you...this is the message from Linds I had previously overlooked...  "My mom is back in the hospital because her stupid doctor didn't put her on the right meds.  He was supposed to give her an anti-clotting medicine, but didn't, just a blood thinner.  she's now had a blood clot go up to her lungs and explode, meaning that she was within minutes of dying.  And still the stupid doctor would not give her clotting meds.	  Anyway, he finally admitted her to the hospital, but she's closer to dying now than ever.	  Oh, and I'm in Alaska, cause I forgot to tell them that."

      Hmm...good question.  The one in question is probably the one that I put  Jar of Flies  and  SAP  on, along with a few bonus tracks of some unreleased and old AIC stuff. I combined them because...well... Jar  is about seven songs, whereas  SAP  is five, so with those twelve, also taking into account that AIC never was a "monster 72041873041943 minute long ballad" band, I put a s'more on there...such as  Died  and  Get Born Again , the two new unreleased ones...well, newish. And really old ones like  Chemical Addiction ,  Suffragate City ,  Queen of the Rodeo  and  I Can't Have You Blues !, all AIC classics that never really got their own album...well, they're from a famous bootleg called  Heroin  that met the wild some time ago; the songs are ultimately prophetic, pointing to "the rockstar lifestyle" as their way, with such lyrics as "I don't know much about heroin but I wanna try, just about everything once before I die"...from  Chemical Addiction , and how true it became.  But hey, JERRY'S still here! For a while, saw some pics of him at a private concert just a few months ago...uhoh. Jerry's getting really thin, those permanent deep bluish-purple circles under his eyes concurrent with massive heroin abuse. Bet Jerry'll get snatched before too long, and I will then cry until my lungs die or my heart explodes, more from effort than from grief. I mean, I love the guy but he's the one killing himself. But still... Jerry must be heard...how can he be heard when he's dead ? Answer me this! I dun want Jerry to die! But I'll still listen to his stuff so all will be well, I don't feel much like making a Jerry crusade as of now, it's humid and looks like we're in a fer a nice little night.  Question: spill what?

      Oh, God.  That sucks, Linds.  Hope she's doing better now.  Josh, spill.  Also, JOSH, since no one else is here...*fumes under her breath* I am going to Birmingham tomorrow and I'll be back Monday.  So...Now everyone knows where I'll be.  Also, check your phone voicemail.  I asked a question and I'd rather not repeat it here.  ;)  Nothing personal, just don't want to keep typing.  See you guys next week...maybe some of you will actually be back.  ~Z

      YES, everyone has.  We're so alone, we are forsaken by the hands that sustain us, they have cut the umbilical cord of our sanity and left us to die with the dogs in the gutter. O sweet and bitter revenge, heed us in this, our time of darkness.  Didn't that sound great? Practicing my poetics. Scared about this poem...scared...

      Well, in the immortal words of Mark Twain, "Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."  Yes, I live.  I breathe.  So here I am, Josh.  Life sucks even more than it did before.  Not only is my dad being bastardly, *takes deep breath to prepare for spilling guts and also preparing (hopefully) for sympathy* my cousin Gael just found out that she has cancer.  Badly.  I mean, monster.  She's smoked for a while but it started as skin cancer, we think, and spread.  Technically it's called "carcinoma without principle cause."  Which means that it's cancer that the doctors don't know how she contracted.  And she's taking chemo.   And I didn't know until TODAY.  And I'll give you two guesses as to which parent told me.  Yeah.  On the way back from lunch, my dad tells me in this fucking patronizing voice and makes me cry, making my mascara go EVERYWHERE.  And it just sucked, so when I got home, I practically jumped out of his car with barely a goodbye and ran into the house, where I just broke down.  I WON'T BREAK DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM.  NEVER AGAIN.  So, as I'm sure you can tell, today sucked.  Yes, I have been busy, but if I might ask, why hasn't anyone called?  No one ever calls me, I have to do all the calling.  I'd really appreciate a phone call every now and then.  Not too much to ask for the girl whose mental state is even more questionable than it was to begin with, is it?  Sorry if I'm antagonistic or just plain rude, but I've had the worst day I've had in a long time.  And I knew about Linds's mom.  Linds called me from the hospital that day.  I also talked to her mom the other day and she sounded good and she said she felt better, so kudos to Mrs. Reid!  Thanks for being concerned and everything.  Please, someone, e-mail or call me.  I'm actually begging here...and if I may ask, what's the deal with the Greek thing?  I didn't go very far back before I wrote this.  Anyway, see ya.  ~Z

      "Carpe diem", says Dead Poet Society. I've never seen it, Abby's told me about it tho...I'm always using it in reference to the horrible Metallica song of the same name, or the line of the Sentenced song  Neverlasting . Sentenced is a great band, all, in case anyone is looking for a great band...for some reason.  Gross, sharing is dumb. Don't give in!  Complete thoughts! W00t! Abby's right, I just noticed...I wonder why it took this long. It's amazing, congrats for passing the third grade Rosie.

I guess I'm on the computer some, and would prolly be considered a geek, but oh well. Computers are the way of the future, geeks just end up teaching the people that made fun of em ;)  Has anyone ever seen Dead Poets Society? I curious since its one of my favorite movies, yet no one I know has seen it. Well I have to go, my sister is yelling at me about some principal called, "Sharing"..whatever that means :p

      Yes, jeans, thank God.  It didn't take any begging at all.  I was like, "Mommy, what should I wear tomorrow?"  And she suggested khakis, but I was like "Well, me and Abby were thinking maybe jeans" and she said, "Well, it would be under choir robes, so I don't see why not" and so now I get to wear jeans to church tomorrow.

There is not a chance that I would ever tell them about that post...not that I tell them about any others...because they would get to excited.  "Yay!  Another way to shelter our youngest daughter!!"  Hey, has anyone noticed how Rosie is writing complete thoughts now?  It's amazing.  Hehe.    Yeh, Linds and I are going to the Lake that starts with a "J."  It should be fun...I guess.

      My mom wants to get me that keychain thing.  I told her she could get it for me if she bought me a new cell phone.  I'm getting the phone by the end of July.  And for all to see, it is Junaluska.  Just looked on my sheety thing that tells what to bring, etc.  Abby, we don't need towels or sheets, cause they're being provided, but we do need to take a snack.  I called Julie, and that's what she said.  Deech typed out the thing out himself, and as everyone knows how proficient he is at that, he left out many details.  Not as many as I would have figured on though.  Maybe next time... heheh.

      You bet I am overprotective. And you will be hearing about the keychain very soon. Heheh.  Abby is going to Lake J-something.  Heh, actually Scott, I don't quite know...I don't really use the computer much...I only use L337 (how I spell it, anyway) just cuz of how much of a bad rap it has, being the accepted 'net geek language and all. 90% of everything I say is based off of "how overused is this", and if it's trite enough, it becomes a part of my standard vocabulary long after it dies down in the mainstream.  Heheheh...well Linds...Abby can tell you about how the cooking went...a massive groan on my part. I was just distracted by my wonderful girlfriend and the suckers kinda...that's enough I think.  Happy fourth to all.

      Huh? Who is going to Lake J-something?  Josh...you're kinda, um, over-protective and yes, it is comforting every now and then but do NOT turn into the parents that everyone hates.  Amusing Story about over-protectiveness: This 4th the Chinese peeps gathered and had a little dinner thingy. Whenever my mom gathers with other moms it's like lets-talk-about-children time and it sucks because the children are in the next room and we can hear them. Anyway, every gathering starts with a "I can't believe how Rosie has grown" comment and this time it led to my protection and how I need to make sure that I have "good" friends, basicly how not to get raped. @.@ Some meddling mother suggests pepper spray keychains for when I get my car keys so of course my mom is estatic about it and wants to get one for me. *groan* It gets BETTER. Xi, you all know him, of course shows his face right then and overhears about the wonderful keychain and starts cracking up, I got him back though. I nailed him with a pillow (I wonder where I got aim) and he spilled his sprite all over himself. It was great, his yelp was classic. =) BTW, the Keychain thing will NEVER happen so I DON'T want to hear about it outside of this blog. thanks  Byebye, Rosie

      You know I'm just kidding Abby, at least I hope you do. I'm sure my "Scott-Bashing" day will come. Hope you guys had a great 4th, mine was ok.  Hey josh, quick question. Do you spell leet, as well leet or 1337? I didn't know you knew much "hacker" speak until the other day. I dont' know if I'll get to talk to you guys before you head off to Lake Jeune (guessing on the spelling)  Alaska . Yes I know its Alesca, but it should be Alaska...anyways, have a great time.

      Notice you didn't include Josh in on that one, Will, which is odd given that I'm more on his level most of the time.  Or included me rather.  But uh, kinda harsh at the end there, don't you think?  Anyway, VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT...  Yall know Elizabeth's cousin, Gael?  Famous for awesome jokes, puns, quotes, etc.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, maybe less, she was diagnosed with monterous cancer all over, basically, called something like "carcinoma without given cause" or something like that.  Well, she passed away a few hours ago.  They were very close.  She's the one that took Liz to Ren Fest every year and stuff.  Needless to say, Elizabeth is very upset.  She's kind of closed herself off from the public right now for obvious reasons, but might I suggest a call here in a day or two?  She's been wanting company for a while, as we all know, but now is probably the time of most need, so we need to make sure everything is taken care of.  Food, company, all we can do.  She's been through a lot lately.  Really, it is the least we could do to help.

      Welcome Scott,  I hope you're having a great summer.  Don't let Rosie scare you (we think she has some problems up there) that's just her way of being nice.    Rosie, What's this about you being the brains of the group?  Do you really believe that you are smarter than Z, Lindsey, and I.  I knew that you were egotistical and all (I'll never be prefect again, etc.) but to believe that you are smarter than Z, Lindsey, and me; this takes egotistical to a whole new level.  I have never met a teacher who could and would honestly say that they were smarter than this triumvirate.  And you seem to forget that the only reason Josh even appears to listen to you is to humor you.  Now that you've gotten me started,  when you attempt to communicate with some one, it is preferrable to use a languange that you both understand.  I spent ten minutes with your  ......hmmmm.....what happened to call me? Don't call me tonight....and finish harry potter now.  this has no more relation to english than does bad pig latin spoken by Migistra Shinkarev.  please attempt to make your writing more legible to  human  eyes.

      Hey, um I'm still waiting for my cookies Abby..and my cherry coke! I would have gotten it myself..but I can't stand to get it :p Thanks for having us over abby, it was lots of fun :)  Well it was good meeting you guys last night! And no Rosie, no one frightened me. Well..there was that one on one conversation with Abby's mom..but that's another story for another time.  We'll have to do it again sometime soon. Hopefully, I'll get to be part of the movie choosing process and I can meet everyone else.

      you're famous cookies... :) Josh, Like we've....well actually I've said, you're a fairy so...either learn to shutup about fingernail polish, skirts, and other girly crap or get used us teasing you....though i really meant what I said about you and the hoop skirt....it would be more than interesting. Oh yeah if you get lost Sunday just as for the Breakfast Club, we're upstairs. Zabeth..if you noticed i hung up rather quickly....that's becuase I was helping my mom cook and she was giving me evil looks and telling me to get off the phone, I'll call you as soon as I get i chance, smile (don't hurt me) life sucks but it'll get better...guys suck but there are some good ones...kinda Will..the essays are online, you just have to search for them like on dogpile.com, if you do that you'll get like tons sites where you can print it off. Liz...hope ur mom is better and if you ever get around to planning that study thing tell me. I'll help plan but we acutally have to form this so that we work and stuff. I leave on the 18th and get back on the 25..but i don't know how we'll do that since we're like taking 2 days to get there and they've only planned 1 day to get back...maybe we'll get back at 11:59pm....who knows Abby....Congrats!...i really really really want to know you better...really! and me and Josh have an...interesting relationship..i think all you've heard me say about him is mean but I promise I luv him to death in a completely sisterly way. If you EVER doubt that call me up and tell me...I'm not paranoid (maybe a little) about that but like....one of my better friends had a gf that thought he and I were too close to be just friends...i promise we were just that, friends..also I hope the best for you two....you're the only one that I've seen that hasn't completely screwed him over in the fact that he's not self-destructing...thank you Scott...don't know you but welcome...i've heard some nice things about you and I hope that my friends don't frighten you...or rather that I don't. I'm kinda the brain of all these peeps...though they're all smart..but I'm usually sane but I insane little episodes.. Will's...the other brain that just is history this history that, Zabeth is the writer and Linds is the peacemaker and Abby is the darling and Josh...is...well Josh.  Anyway gtg peeps but Smile...life's great *ducks* Rosie

      So, yeh...it seems that ever since Scott has joined, all we talk about are painted finger nails...speaking of which, mine need to be touched up.  I'm sorry that your father is so insecure with the pinkish color they were...maybe blue would be better. Anyway...yeh...not much else to talk about.  Please try to make it later, Scott, it'll be super fun...plus I'm making cookies.

      You got that too? A snide comment on your finger decoratives, I mean? I swear everyone thinks they're  SO  funny cuz they can make jokes about guys with nail polish. Altho some of them are serious about saying "nice nails"...which is rather interesting.

      Abby didn't offer to paint my toe nails, I think you have a feet-phobia Abby.  The best part of the whole thing was last night when we were out to eat, our waitress said, "Nice nails." After that, my dad spazzed and made me go buy fingernail polish remover right after dinner. It was great :p  Sadly I won't be able to meet you guys tonight :( Thanks for inviting me though. I have to go to Nasvhille to check in on my grandfather. I'll have to meet you guys sometime soon!

      Nice.  That's almost as hard to explain as the time a bunch of five year olds in a Christian group noticed my painted toenails while swimming and were convinced that I was the devil and would put a hex on them. Consequently, I abused my power greatly but it was a barrel of monkies.  I enjoy painted nails, I just wish my sis hadn't stolen my pretty black...  And here I am, a guy that could be vaguely homosexual having feminine product battles with his sister. This is the part where I shut up and let everyone make fun of me for being dumb and saying too much :)       Bonus

      Sigh.  Guess what guys...today's not Tuesday. Heheh.  I was so messed up from the goodness of today that I thought it was Tuesday and I went to my guitar lesson...very surprised to see my teacher ask me why I had come so early..."24 hours early, dude" he said. So amidst a row of supressed chuckles I grinned and walked out.  And I set up ALL MY TOYS. Yay! But one of the very expensive condensers decided that it didn't want it to work right anymore...so I have to send it back. Also...lots of sounds that didn't get through...like the drums themselves...and lots of other sounds that did...the air conditioner...the computer...the motor on the recorder...the freakin'  hum of the lights in my room ...any passing cars...my breathing...walking...bad placement of the stands...the dogs...these are the best and thus, the worst mics I've ever had. Tomorrow, I'm going to have a session, and I have a good feeling that the whole thing will be us setting up and trying to make things not gay and sound good.  I deleted the first cut of  Broken Me  for this thing. These are the final demos so everybody gets a copy reallllll soon...actually, probly the first day of school or something like that. We're a really dumb band but we're not that bad.

      Josh just got his toys from the UPS guy while I was on the phone with him and is currently crying so hard he couldn't tell yall about it, so I got the honor.  Liz's computer is down, and wants people to know that she's not dead, but to please call her.  She's begging.  Now for me, well, I was on the phone with most of yall all day, so I don't have much to say, except that it was indeed a happy day.  One that I've been waiting for for a while now.  Everything is good, for the most part, I do believe.  If things go well.  Scott's supposed to call again tonight, so I'll know whether things from here out are going to be good or not.  Abby's at his house right now, so hope they're having fun.

Heh yes, I am mildly fruity, mostly since I've consumed almost an entire pitcher of raspberry tea (from concentrate!) during the course of the day.

      Linds, if you don't watch it you'll end up with three to five little monkeys with emotions ranging from homicidal killing spree to blissful ignorance in your head all fighting for control, this condition is known as schizosimiasanguinariavsimiafelicitainprimuscertamenphrenia and no Z I don't think you can manage to translate that, though it is all latin.

Half of me is really happy, but the other is really depressed for no reason.  So maybe I'm a schizo-manic-depressive???  Had a nice long (hour and a half) talk with Scott...

I don't know how I should respod to that, Z, please do kill Rosie what ever she did warrents it, Rosie, Z has never killed anyone (that we know of) so what ever you did  will probably not get you killed, just thrown in a dark dank hole antd tortured with an assortment of midevil gadgets including, but not limited to, Racks, red hot tongs, iron maidens, and cats of nine tails, have fun.    will

You're still moving him to the place you had originally planned, right?  Hope he's all right with it now.  Anyway, I'll see yall later.  Remember soup kitchen on Tuesday. Please someone come with me.  (Rosie, hint hint)  I need to know whose name(s) to put on the list by tomorrow or Sunday.  We'll need to be at BUMC at 10:45 am.

My response to last night...."...". And just for the record, if you don't hear this from my voice first, I won the smallest boobs contest so piss on  all of you . Alex and I quite agree that girls are, in fact, the more perverted side of the species now, even we're not that bad, we just do crazy stuff like jump over mailboxes, expose ourselves, drink caffeine until we overload, watch  COOL  (and note that word in context) movies, and such.

We need help, so if you can make it, yay!!!  Camp still the same only now it's pouring the rain. :(  I think we'll live though.  Volleyball tourney's probably canceled though. :)  That makes me happy. Now I don't have to go pretend to be excited.  All right, talk to yall later.

But that should sound absolutely incredible, I think I would have a slight heart attack, seizure, and aneurism at the same time if I heard it. Good luck!...altho the next time youse goys (*woot i said uz goys, linds is gonna pwn me*) read this it shall be over and we shall hear your tortured tales of a nice, Christian-ly wholesome night of family fun. Yay!  Will Whiteside, you are incredible. I think you've been reading your Rhetoric, atlho slightly twisting the whole "no affronting the receiver of an argument" part, but whatever, yo. Tizotally bizongin', wizurd. Thanks for the sympathies. I would say more about it but I have to stop myself from laughing after reading that soliliquy of my defense, which shall last (the laughing, that is) for the next few days or so because I am incredibly bored, locking myself in my room as soon as I wake up and working out songs, putting together Abby's party, fixing my amps, playing cool video games ( Lord of the Rings , God curse it), jumping off the roof of my house (that requires unlocking my room, but it happens), setting things on fire, setting myself on fire, breaking stuff, going to Taco Bell, etc. It may seem very thrilling...   SURPRISE   !!!! It sucks!  I'm going to go back up to my room now and try not to break a limbsorryabbyiknowyou'llbemadbutitstoomuchfuniloveyouplease?.   Subliminal messages are awesome. I'm going to stop doing drugs now and leave you all at peace.

      Well, that's very nice to know, Rosie.  My friend Kyndall and TJ and Scott (who is on this BLog) and Chad are all Baptists too.    Anyway, what's up, you guys?  I'm at camp...still...the food still sucks, the worship services are still too long and we still have 4 and a half hours of free time left, during which time I plan to take a shower, sing some songs in a fictional language, raise some money for this guy who says if we raise $50, he won't shave his head (he has very nice hair) and maybe take a nap, and some other various projects.    This keyboard sucks majorly.    Well, what else have I to say?  I still have 49 minutes left on my little time card thingy for the cafe.    Tonight there is a "talent show" which, hopefully, our little group is going to perform Row, Row, Row Your Boat in Ubbi Dubbi in a round.  Thats only if Linds and Becca and I can actually get the last line up to speed, and then sing it in a round.  It should be interesting to say the least.   The speaker dude we have is a jerk.  I don't like or agree with any of his philosophies, and he talks to us like we are complete idiots who don't know what we are doing in life and all that jazz.  Yeh, so anyway, that's all I really have to say.

      THEY SCREWED UP MY BLOG!!!  As for the other posts, josh did go to sunday worship, it just wasn't at the baptist church.  He came to see abby off to Junaluska, not alaska, which is where i just got back from.  oh, by the way, there's an internet cafe here, $1.25/30 minutes as opposed to the .75/min on the cruise, so we should be on a lot.  anyway, we're having fun.  i guess.  No one's really here.  3 hour worship services with people who treat us like we're three.  Fun.  Gotta love it.  So, yeah...

      no not all of us go to Brentwood Methodist, though it does seem the vast majority do.  Josh I feel sorry for you, first your girlfriend leaves for Junaluska (thank you for the correction) and then Rosie finds out that you weren't at church.  you have my sincere apologies.    Congraulations RosiePosieTaoTaoTheRabbit,  you have learned to speak your mind clearly and pass fourth grade.  Why do you care if Josh misses church? What does it matter to you?  If Josh is damned to Hell for missing church, that just means you'll just get to hang out with him in the afterlife Miss "I'll never be perfect again".  And if Josh needs to "be shot for missing Sunday Worship"  I'm sure the devil will oblige him.  Why do you want to shoot him anyway?  Do you want to speed his voyage to Eternal Damnation?  Or will getting shot save him?  Is being murdered by a crazed Chinese religious zealot good enough to get you into Heaven?  Do you really want to find out?  Seeing as the answer to the last question was no, why don't you ask why he wasn't at church instead of threatening his life, it wouldn't piss me off quite so much, and it might illicit a more proactive answer from Josh.

We moved him yesterday, and he did ok, but we're going to have to bump up his "Care level" starting monday.  So anywho, I'm interested to hear your analysis of Drunks With Guns and I must concur that any Pepsi product sucks. I have decided that MSN messenger and ICQ are evil. I need to add that to my long list of things that evil. Whelp I'm off to go hang out with some friends, later peeps.

      Hey kids.  No one's left.  It is thus that I've resolved to make at least one short post a day on here, just to keep this mofo alive, and I'll probably say something extremely random as well, and I would encourage the remaining members (Scott, Will, Z (maybe?), as infrequently as you all frequent this wonderful establishment) to either make fun of me or add your own equally random rantings and whatnot.   And let it be said, that I am a lonely old man, struggling for attention using trite speech patterns (L337, anyone?), ridicule, and strange, borderline bizarre, analysises (trite speech pattern) of my surroundings and events that I predict  could  happen and be amazingly funny if this proverbial outcome were to be reached.   This is mostly because I miss my girlfriend, and I feel to vent my frustrations in a manner consistent with my innate retardedness: hence.   So...two things.  One: popcorn is really good. It would be better if I hadn't saved the wuss bag for last, the bag that decided to set itself on fire and burn everything within to a buttery crisp. But it's still good, even when accompanied with tasteless, horsepiss Caffeine Free, Diet Pepsi.  Second: there is a band called Drunks With Guns, and their name is painfully apt or so I've heard. I'm going to download some of their songs now and I'll give an analysis later.   Later, team! w00t!

      What, me, die? That's impossible.  I've survived being set on fire (several times, woot!), jumping off the roof of my house...altho my heel still hurts a lot to walk on, so I'm going to have to go get it checked...and then I've survived kickboxing on a half-springless trampoline and dangerous stunts in a swimming pool, the least of which involved me messing up a flying squirrel dive                  really                        bad and landing on my back...PAIN. And then being kicked off the diving board, being tackled by two people in midflight, dodging a high-velocity pool basketball, and THEN...cutting some people off, trying to calm down a really angry and large guy after he thought one of us was giving him the bird, and then racing on Concord Road. I won. Of course I won. And then we pulled up next to a cop car and played the Rage Against The Machine song  F*#@ the Police  which was  INCREDIBLY  funny, even more funny when the cop started laughing and gave Brooks (the one who was playing it) the bird and stuff. Some of that was yesterday.  And if I'm not mistaken, it's almost the end of the month...whereafter my cousin is having his birthday come about, whereafter he will be getting his digital camera, WHEREAFTER...  Many of these stunts...  Shall be repeated...like the "rocket in the pocket" one which I am still worshipped for by the ones who saw it, and many other, NEW ones, and skits, and live performances. With music from  STRANGLEBOX  (buy our stuff!), Homegrown, cKy, and MORE! It's going to be incredible.   But die? I don't die.  And if I do, o well, at least I died grinnin'. And that's the ultimate plus right there.

      Ok leaving like 2 hours so every have fun and stay safe. Jaoh that means no jumping off buildings...that kinda gets in the way of staying alive. Linds, Abby, and I won't be here to drown your boredom in so please please please don't jump off the roof and don't set yourself on fire. Will and Zabeht, we're meeting sometime after the 25th (that's a friday) at night for a couple of hours to figure out what the essays are saying and what we're supposed to say in the essays. Will, I think you have the wrong copy of Aristotle. It's supposed to be THe Rhetoric and The Poetics of Aristotle not the Art of Rhetoric. You can find the right version at BN.com, it's got a green cover and it's like $9. enjoy! Everyone keep safe please please please. If you absolutely need me or something has happened (like Josh just died) call Zabeth for my number, she has it. Zabeth, I'm counting on you to make sure Jaoh isn't dying.  Luv you all -Rosie

      A little transcription of one of the tracks on the now-completed CD! Woot:  5. Enjoying the CD?  Hi kids? Enjoying the CD so far? Just thought I would cut in and like...say "what's up?"...so, what's up? Don't say the sky or I'll kick your ass. I'm serious. Wachu think, I'm not gonna come over there right now and kick your ass? Whadoyou think, huh? Whadoyou think? Punk! A-hole! Heh. No I'm just kidding, you're awesome, I love you. I don't know who you are but I love you anyway. That could be homosexual. Bet Will's listening to this right now and just thinking, like, "Oh my God, I have a gay guy's CD,"...it's true. I'm gay. I'm GAY. 'K not really. But that is a very funny idea cuz...uh, yeah, whatever. I must say kids, it's...12 o clock in the morning. I'm sitting here making random tracks for the CD just cuz I wanna fill a-lots of space, and um...so far...d'I dunno. You probably heard...LET ME GO...and you probably heard SO LOW...they rhyme! And other stuff, there's gonna be a lot of stuff on here, mostly ideas I've had that didn't quite make the cut, for instance, the song called DOWN...I don't even know the lyrics, I can't hear 'em anyway so I cut 'em out. It's just a guitar piece and some bass and other stuff but...um...um...I...I hope you guys are 'joyin' the CD, I know I am! I like making CDs, I dunno why the hell I'm doing this but I like it anyway. So...enjoy. I know I'll be back at the end. Have fun kids.

      Frickin' WOOT.  Of course I know this, but HEY, it's the greatest song ever. And the second greatest band in the world (that's us!) can play it...ok-ish. Woot again!  Hey Abby, my phone's being gay, it's a bit storm-shy. Like always, right? O well...have fun at that place...thingy where the Mexicans are going to take me.  I dun have the car. I'm at my dad's making sure nothing decides to detonate and to keep the cats alive and stuff.   I never knew how much I drink until I came here, and there's nothing. All of the  caffeine-free and diet  Pepsis are gone, in like...two days. Not that there were many...of course I never mass-consume caffeinated beverages. And now working on some white cranberry raspberry something-or-other Brand X thing, and as soon as that's gone, I've got coffee, and I've got uno non-alcoholic beer, and they taste horrible so I probly won't be consuming that...yes, I know everyone is freaking out because I used the word " beer "...and water, god forbid. This is Nashville. Water here is basically sewage run thru a chlorine filter.  But that's enough about me, how about the rest of you?

      No kidding.  I've played video games if it counts when you move your little dude like a foot and it dies and the game is over.  That's what usually happens to me.   I forgot to mention that the diet, caffeine-free, room temperature coke is also watered down.

      Almost good that we weren't away longer.  We may have had an all out war over the best video games and soft drinks.  I know  absolutely nothing about video games, mostly cause I've never played, really (you can add it to my list, Scott), but everyone knows that Coke is the best "soda" in the world.  But burnt popcorn sucks.  That's about all yall talked about this week, which is kind of sad, but now I'm caught up.

      Well, this BLog peep is about ready to shoot anyone who sings.  Linds and I are back from choir tour and in a roundabout way of putting it, this week was an experience.  Yup...wahoo.  Fun times, fun times.    I'm glad to hear all the lively conversation on the BLog.  You know, very fasinating.    My mother loves burned popcorn, in fact thats the only type of popcorn she'll eat and she also will only drink caffeine-free diet and ROOM TEMPERATURE coke.  Talk about disgusting.  I, myself, as many of you know, am a hardcore Sprite drinker.  Talk to you guys later!!

      Aww dude c'mon. CS is the greatest game ever created.  It's the greats that never lose their touch and all, etc. Whatever, it was amazing. Last night I entirely pwned EVERYONE, which has never happened before because I really suck at it. But I finished 90-37, everyone else was negative. HAR HAR HAR. Ok enough loser video game kid talk...altho more on my BLog, for those who care, heheheh.  We (my friends and I) play CS on and off...like, we'll play for a solid month or so, and then one of us will drop out, and then another, and eventually we'll stop, and then we'll start again. It's start again time, except I've become a god somehow, which is great because it definitely deflates their overly-blown heads...tho why they get such joy in repeatedly killing a n00ber that doesn't even move when the round starts is beyond me.   But whatever, how are all the BLog peeps doin'?

      Well hello all.  I spent most of the day playing with heavy things, so that's why this post came a bit late.  Eagh, stupid, stupid. You think he'd learn after the thousandth time or so, "maybe I should decrease that time a lil' bit"? Well, I dunno.  Drunks With Guns. I've only found one song called  Pavement ...it's a musical, and I must add, it's very drunken. As is most of their music. It turns out, Drunks With Guns began in 1984 as a punk band and spent more time making up the names of their songs that actually writing them. The music is incredibly worthless, it's the same throughout the entirety of the songs, so I've now heard, after hearing the very wonderful  Punched In The Head  and  some other songs with pretty offensive names ...just go look for them if you really want to know.   As with any punk band, they broke up from internal dissent and began a legal battle for possession of the name Drunks With Guns. So it is. But they are very drunk, let it be known right now.   True, I'm more of a Coke person. For a while I was a Pepsi person, I dunno what happened. I guess Coke got cheaper and I started buying that again. But Coke is like...the Jack Black of the carbonated beverage world, whereas Pepsi is more the Turning Leaf Chardonnay. Take the caffeine out of it and make it diet, tho, and it becomes Sewage In a Gold-Plated Can, Calorie Free. Gross. And whatever happened to Pepsi One? That stuff was horrible too, but I haven't seen it lately so I wondered...  Eep, I dunno about MSN but I don't like ICQ...I used it for about three days and then I was going to cry and do something dangerous with a sharp object to myself. But what's so evil about them from your standpoint?  Sigh. Days are really slow lately...has anyone noticed?  Something incredibly random: your skin actually cooks if it's thin enough and it touches a sunlight-heated car surface. My knuckle will bear testament, it was really sporadic and incredibly gross. But anyway...no more wasting electricity on the stove, no sir.   Goodnite friends, have a flower-filled, sunshining day.

      Hello, Scott.  I cannot say that I have had the pleasure of hearing from you before.  Would you indulge me in telling me a little about yourself?  I myself am a severely disturbed girl who is extremely bitter about her father's despicable decision to divorce (great alliteration there) and am a sufferer of frequently fluctuating (damn, there it goes again) moods.  And sometimes I have to pry my foot out of my mouth, like yesterday, but at least (usually) I can laugh at myself.  Please check out my website http://www.livejournal.com/users/divamercury/ if you want to know more...my fingers aren't cooperating at the moment and I think I should stop for a bit.  Hello, all.  Talk to you soon.  Keep reading my website if you want to.  ~Z

      In order to prevent my somnolence from causing me to say something I might regret, I will content myself with relating only the following sentiments, Linds:  1) I am fully aware of what you said earlier regarding me, including the maybe.  Thus I didn't include everything I wished to say because I knew you would point your former comments out.  Remember my chronic paranoia these days...to say that I didn't trust people before all this shit hit the fan would be correct, but now consider it severely amplified.  Huge trust issues, so please bear with me.  Nevertheless, I'm over it all now. 2) Am I insane in thinking that I let you all know when I would be back?  I could have sworn that I posted or e-mailed or TOLD someone when I'd be getting back.  If not, then I apologize for my negligence, my being an ass, and the subsequent hindrance of your making plans.   3) Anything but those days that we're mentoring should work fine.   4) Please call me soon.  I've been trying to get in touch with you for quite some time but neither of our schedules have been working out favorably for that.  Maybe I'm a little testy, because I felt neglected.  Stupidly, I admit, but still.  As for everyone else:  Rosie:  I was glad to see you today @ The Torture Chamber/ Chasm Leading Straight To Hell/ School.  It's been a while.  Will: Again, glad to know you liked the postcard.  Your e-mail was definitely diverting and I enjoyed it.    Josh: You don't talk too much.  I liked hearing from you, too.   Now having dispensed with the formalities, let me please reiterate that I apologize for overreacting, if that was what I did, but I've learned that the only person I can really trust is myself and I'm working on extending that to my mom and to you all.  It is working pretty well...but hell, we all have setbacks sometimes, right?  Just tolerate me.  Hopefully this will be the last time I have to discuss the "D" word on this site.  I'll reserve that for mine.  ~Z

       Liz : note below where it says (and take notice of the maybe, explained as I didn't know when you were getting home.  If it was the day before school started, could have been a bad thing to wait on you) "And maybe Liz, when she gets home from wherever she is... Need to do it within the next weekish though."  Anyway, that's not the point...   Rosie : of course, I'm always right.  But I hope I'm not right in this case.  Hopefully everything will work out.  Hope it doesn't turn out like Ben or Xi.    Josh  : ha!  I made your name bold and italisized to make up for rosie's wrongdoing   Will AND Josh AND Liz :  Next Monday or Wednesday or Thursday are great days for me.  I know on Tuesday and Friday, both me and Liz, and maybe Will have mentoring.  What's best for yall?     Scott :  didn't want you to be left out, so hey, how's life?  Haven't talked to you in  forever  (right..)  Went shopping, bought hangers, thought you'd be impressed.  I also bought a lot of new clothes, so I may need more hangers now, though...  Am I leaving anyone out?  Don't think so...  At least, that's here...   *sob* I MISS ABBY!!! *sob*

      What Rosie, I dun get my name in bold? And what shock? Ain't nothing too surprising anymore.  HUMPHREY BOGART IS GOD. And I'm going to be just like him. Just watch as I walk in with a $1000 Italian suit and slicked-back short hair. Heheheh. I just got done watching  Casablanca ...what a badass movie...and I'll talk about it more on mine. But it was SO L337.  And I've heard a lot about said Last of the Mohicans, so I probly should join this limited frenzy and say "OOH OOH ME TOO". My days consist mostly of watching old movies...that was today's choice, along with old episodes of South Park, which has become the funniest and most disgusting show ever.  I'm a little better. But I'm getting really fat cuz I haven't been running (DRUGS!) so yah...I got addicted to NyQuil, it was a lot of fun trying to quit. And stuff.  Here's looking at you, kids. Tata.

      Oh, forgot to mention, Rosie, that Last of the Mohicans is R.  Don't know if that makes a difference, but if you don't like violent movies with lots of fake blood, then you won't like it, even if it is a great love story too.  No sex, don't worry.  That's about all I can say.  ~Z

      I feel your pain, Roseo.  My mom's yelling at me for not doing my summer reading but I SWEAR I'll do some tomorrow...unless I decide not to.  ;)  Anyway, you'll only see Mohicans if you come over here or if I go over there, because I'm not letting that DVD out of my SIGHT!  I love it!  It's great.  I bought the soundtrack.  I'm completely smitten, but I won't elaborate unless you want to go on my LiveJournal.  Aaaaaanyway, feeling better tonight.  Last night was hell.  I just tend to be really down after I see my dad.  It's almost like coming off a caffeine high or something...well, talk to you guys later.  ~Z

      Hey all,  Life sucks btw, my parents are being extra anal, lemme rephrase that, my dad is being extra anal. Apparently I'm not studying enough for him. =P  Anyway  Zabeth,  I've been looking for the DVD, The Last of the Mohicans. Any chance that I can catch a viewing of it too?   Linds , I think I'm going to kill you for saying that I'm going to drive myself from that guy. Erg but you're right and that is what sucks MAJORLY! I'm going to try NOT to do that this time. Did I tell you that he's awesome, kind, open, genuine, sweet, christian? OMG i sound like a gushing girl. I think it's time to shutup.  Josh, don't die of shock.

      I like the end of that post, Z. Heheheh.  Well as you can all tell, I'm again up way too late and drugged out of my mind. You should have seen me trying to drive in Nashville today...it's a really good thing I have a gun. It's amazing that Abby's parents trust me so much...heheh, ok I'm not that bad but still. Dumb people anger me.  So cool...I'm pretty much recovered, give or take my throat which still hurts a little...nothing some drugs can't help. Again, whenever thou all wanteth to partaketh in said event, I shalt await ye.

      Thank you so much Will.  You are doing your job well, I see.  I appreciate it.  Really.  As for the rest of you, I would appreciate it if you would keep something in mind: I WANT TO BE INVOLVED WHEN YOU PLAN SOMETHING.  Period and sign.  Even if you think I won't be able to come, ASK.  ALWAYS MAKE SURE.  This is a rule that I thought was already in existence.  I asked Will to help me out on this note, and if not for him, I would have been screwed because half the time I have no idea what Aristotle is talking about.  Plus, I know something that could help us understand one of the essays, unless you already know about it, but to find out, I'll have to be there.  PLEASE don't ignore me anymore.  I'm already insecure enough with all the problems in my life and I wish I could be certain of something: your friendship.  I will be back on the Blog regularly now.  My traveling is over and my computer is alive and kicking.  Don't you guys remember what happened the last time you snubbed me?  The movie thing last year?  Let me just say that my parents are much more relaxed with me now.  If I told Mom I wanted to detonate a nuclear bomb in downtown Nashville, my mom would say, "Sure.  Just don't forget you radiation suit and leave one for me, too."  Well, not really, but she is letting me do a lot more than I ever could.  Let me also mention that I can DRIVE.  No car yet, but that will change soon.  I'm really sorry that I'm raking you guys over the coals about this.  But I'm really, truly begging here.  I have enough things to worry about.    Sigh.  I'm sorry.  I had a meeting with Daddy Dearest and he is STILL refusing to get me a car until I "have more experience."  Well, he might be justified, but he's still being a prick.  I want to get more experience in MY car, not my mom's car that I will never be driving.  So.  Anyway, he got me a small tape recorder, which does make him better in my eyes, since it's going to (hopefully) help with my writing.  Sometimes if I say it, it works.  But then I forget it, and if I try to write it down, it doesn't work.  So...I need to get back to my kick-ass (literally) DVD of The Last of the Mohicans.  Sorry about the tongue-lashing again, and I hope you don't think I was over-reacting, but I thought I told you when I'd be back.  I know I told SOMEONE, not sure who, though.  But I'm over it now.  I just needed to release that into the cosmos so next time I can say you were warned. ;)  Someone please help me.  ~Z

      Hello 4143019 (that's this BLog's ID tag, in case anyone noticed).  Yes yes, I was up really late, I slept til lordy knows when (most of the day) so it took a while to get to sleep. It's weird...the past three days when I've decided to go to bed, every clock I seem to look at reads 11:10, one minute away from the almighty 11:11. Altho I never wait around for it. I'm drugged all.   O well...I have to go at the minute but I'll think this out a bit and tell you as soon as possible when it would be a good time, practically anytime really.

      Why are you still posting.  Go sleep!!  That's the Abby in me coming out.  She told me to make sure you don't kill yourself while she's away.  But, since you did post, when do you want to do it.  Can't do it Wed- Fri, but any time after that is fine.  And once Josh, gets better, obviously.  When's the best time for you, Will?

      ...  I can't wait until I'm better. I know like over half this BLog is probably dog devotees so the cat enthusiasts are going to have to put on a helluva intellectual show...  So count me out. Heheh. But I'll try my best.  Yes, Linds, let's go a la library...I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm not sure if you actually need that many, I thought it was a certain number per chapter. But I dunno so don't listen to me.   Schedules are supposed to come right before school, they should be here any day now.  That's about it then. G'bye all.

      Dogs are obviously the better choice a) dogs actully care about you not just the food and shelter you provide. b) dogs can communicate much better than cats,  have you ever tried to teach a cat a trick?  they don't seem to catch on very quickly (or not at all). this isn't because they think such trick are useless and stupid, it is because they cannot understand the signal you are trying to give them.  dogs, by their very nature, understand other living things better.  They regularly communicate with other dogs, all cats ever communicate is "get out of here" and "I like you".  which do you think is smarter a fly or a colony of ants?  a lone creature or one that has lots of friends to help it? dogs are therefore smarter than cats c) dogs are pack animals ergo better friends.   d) dogs can and will protect you and your house.  Have you ever heard of a cat that prevented a burglary? e) and most certainly the best reason, my mom is not allergic to dogs, as she is to cats

      Ok, couple of things.  1)  Just finished Aristotle along with quote log.  I have 94 quotes in all.  How many are there aupposed to be?  They range from 3-11ish per chapter.  2)  When are we supposed to get our schedules?  Note, when you get them, post them.  3)  Will, and Josh, when you feel better, do yall want to go to the library sometime and work on this freaking essay?  It's not that hard, just sort of long and tedious, just thought it might be better to do it with someone.  Rosie can't come, but maybe we can do it.  And maybe Liz, when she gets home from wherever she is... Need to do it within the next weekish though.

      Rosie, if that isn't witnessing I don't know what is...but please, not on the blog...this is my one place for un-deep conversations.  Please take lessons from Josh on this.  Talk about Cokes and video games, and all will be great.  No more religion, at least on the blog.  I've had about as much as I can take for a while.

      Aww woot, finally someone else has mentally imbibed the pure and wonderful knowledge of the joys of caffeine. I'M SO PROUD!  I have a Wild Cherry Pepsi sitting next to me. Not quite the same but it helps.  AND ANOTHER WOOT...strangely enough, video games and girls...such an odd combination. You girls sound like my mother when it comes to vids, heheh. I used to be the biggest Mario head ever, until Nintendo started sucking and making kids' games...MARIO IS NOT A GAME FOR CHILDREN, there's horrible, grisly death and obscenities in Mario if you look hard enough. It's like playing a The Who record backwards and hearing a demonic subliminal message.  Mario Kart is God's reward to kids for not screwing him over so much as everyone else. We were talking about  a  computer game (CounterStrike woot, or CS woot, as it is called (mostly by me)), but whatever.  GROSS as to the Coke.  GROSS ! But I've already shared my view on this (a three second UGH), but just so you all know...Abby's mother should NOT be an example as to how to drink a Coke. As a matter of fact, I'm going to demonstrate the proper technique on imbibing such drinks on my online cookbook, which is going to be out soon...it's not published yet, so don't even try. But it WILL be, kids!

      Hey All, I'm back and I don't want to be. I would love to have stayed there for awhile longer. I think I was running on will power on the last couple of days since I came home and slept from 1am-11am and then 2pm-5pm...I think that's around 14 hours of sleep. I think I can honestly tell you all that I've never done that before. (Josh I now know the power of cherry coke=energy) Anyway I loved my roommates and I'm going to miss them, the randomness of our songs, the pregnancies and births, the veggie tales, the red-neckness, and the FON's/ DWH's. Ask me sometime what those means....each has a story that I don't have the coordination to type out but they are amusing to say the very least. I have a stalker and so did my roommate. I met some awesome guys and gals in my mission track team. I now have my own body guard that is HUGE...but he's in knoxville and he's also a youth leader. That came in handy when I told him that Fletch the stalker was being too friendly.  I think I'm going to try to get in touch with Cityteam...my favortie mission track. they're a drug rehab place for Chester. Chester was the good part of town to be in they it went down so now you can't walk outside after dusk or bad bad things happen. But i loved it. God's love was so alive there. Here in Brentwood it's common for people to take God's love taken for granted but the ones that were saved in Chester, they had suffered much but they also knew the greatness of God and they worshiped with a passion that I find lacking in Brentwood. I went to M-fuge to partly test my faith and see if I truly did believe...I found instead that passion for living in Christ that I've been lacking. Most don't know but I've been a christian ever since I was 7 but I drifted throughout intermediate and middle school. Those were horrible years so I've never told you before what happened then. If you guys really search, I don't think you'll ever find that I've really mentioned my middle school years beyond the fact that I hated them, I went to FMS, and I knew Arden and Christina. Becuase of those awful years I started at BBC and I have worlds of thanks to give them. I found a loving and supporting group where I did get to know Him more and now he's my Friend. I can't wait for school to start. I've failed so many times and yet he's still willing to see if my faith lasts and I pray that it will this time through out the school year and beyond. I love you all guys.

      I'm sorry Rosie I was a little harsh Your essay is pretty good, though if I could change anything I would change the first sentence to "Webster's defines. . . " or something like that. the 'today's definition' is a little cheesy and not very descriptive and sound like you made up that idealistic junk.

I love meeting new people on the Blog.  You are so high in my book.  So I like flattery.  Sue me.  ;)  Thanks for the comment about the site.  Which, by the way, is my next destination.

      Ok info about myself:  I go to Clearview Baptist Church, I run sound and other multimedia stuff for my youth services and such (stop doing it for the church several years ago). I'm a junior, and I'm homeschooled. I think cats own dogs, I have two cats one of which is 20+ lbs and one that is a normal healthy size. We have one dog who is 14+ years old and it wasn't my decision to get him. He's a decent dog though :p  I have one sister, all my grandparents are alive except my dad's mom. Right now my dad's father has been in and out of the hospital, been diagnosed with allzheimers and has been moved to assisted living within the last two months. Someone has to go see him every day, but he's about 5 min away from us. Anywho, I guess that along with school is occupying most of my life at the moment. Oh yah my AIM is weezymidget and msn is weezymidget@hotmail.com for anyone that cares :p

      Hello everyone.  Sorry I haven't posted in ages, I've been sick, in school, and sleepy. Getting up at 6:45 every morning sucks :(  So anywho. I heard you guys were at the library yesterday and I think Josh said he saw me. Sadly I didn't see you guys, otherwise I would have stopped by. Hopefully your study group thingy went well and I'll get to meet you all some time soon. I was there picking up some stuff to read for school to take to the beach. Yah I'm going to the beach next week :)  Well I gotta run, I'll post more about myself later Liz. Nice site by the way

      Hey hey, I be back.  Anyway, I forgot to tell you a bunch of stuff yesterday.  First of all, wait, I forgot again...um...ok, skip--ahh, I got it.  The hotel doesn`t charge for internet if you are staying here!!!  Second, French people are really skinny here.  Like, seriously, I`m chubby here.  Dead serious.  Ok, now close your mouth.  Third, the people smell terrible.  There is no deoderant.  Well, there is, they just don`t embrace the universal "lets not knock each other out with our bo" concept.  Such a shame.  Ok, now for a little activity.  Look at your keyboard.  Find the "a."   Now move it to where the "q" is.  Switch the "w" and "z" and the "m" and ":."   Now you can`t just type a "."  Nope, now you choose shift semi-colon.  Then add a whole bunch of french characters, such as , ,  and , and you cqn imagine something close to the thing I`m typing on.  It sucks.  Majorly.  Well, tomorrow I`m off to Toulon, the city my sister lived in for a year.  It should be...interesting to say the least.  Again, don`t know if I`ll be back, but I`ll try.  After Toulon, it`s the night train to Italy.    I`m going to go eat dinner...it`s a 7 hour time difference here, so don`t think that I always eat so early.  Bye bye!!

      Ok, good joke, if you're conservative, but it does illustrate a good point:  Geroge Bush and a couple of his buddies are out fishing, and George hangs his line on a tree.  He simply gets out of the boat, walks across the water, unsnags the line, and walks back across the water back into the boat.  The next day, the New York Times's (a  very  liberal newspaper) headline read "Bush Can't Swim."  Ok, maybe not as good as I originally thought, but it's a lot for my dad to tell a joke, so bear with me.  Ah, going to get my schedule today.  Hope it's good.  Anyway, I guess I'll see some of yall at least today.

I`m not going to type much cause this keyboard is completely weird, but I`ll type as much as possible.  Having fun at school, Scott?  Josh, WHY DIDN`T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE SICK?!  Have fun writing your paper-thingy.  I don`t know if I`ll be able to update.  We leave here in about 2 days and then its off to Toulon and Venice.    btw, that was witnessing and dogs are ALWAYS better than cats.

Anyways kids, so now it's out on the table and that's a good thing. Of course, not really opened to discussion, still...H00-ah! Time marches on.  I would have you all know that my room smells of wonderful lavender; THANKS ABBY!   \/\/0\/\/! I'm going to drink another Pepsi now and jump off the roof! Or go to Nashville, I wish I could jump off that roof, it's a lot less of a drop. But you know how these things go...no pain, no gain.  Hoo-ah friends, here's lookin' at you, kids.

      Now Linds.  You know me way too well for me to be angry at you for going out with him.  Honestly...of course, I would have been freaking out too, if it had been me, so I guess it's all fair.  I'm going to check him out a little more, and then I'll give you my decsion...haha, it sounds like a court-room drama show.    Anyway, how's school going??  I'm enjoying sleeping late...yep, this morning I got to get up at 6:30.  Boy howdy was I happy that I realized it was mid-afternoon with my time schedule and therefore was no longer tired.  I then got to read a wonderful book, "Desert Solitaire" about a park ranger who lives alone in the middle of Utah.  I found out last night that the author was an environmental terrorist.  Boy howdy, he is so dibble.  It sucks.  Majorly.    I have food in the house now.  PRAISE THE LORD!!  (You need to say that like a 50-year-old Gospel singing black woman to get the full effect that I'm going for)  Therefore, I'm going to go eat some of it.

      All right, most people already know this because Scott and I can't keep our mouths shut, but for those of you who don't know, I've now told Abby (and am still alive) that I'm going out with Michael, and yes (*cough cough Scott, Josh*) will be going out with him for as long as possible if Abby approves. (best friends over boyfriends- we're gonna pwn j00 Josh!!)  So, yell at me if you want to, but that's the situation.  Just thought you might like to know.  Now I've got to go tell my parents...not half as hard as Abby, let me assure you.  But she took it   really   well.  I knew all along she would.  (Right...that's why I sat dying in the back corner of Ms. Calhoun's English)

And then you have to walk all the way to your kitchen!  I'm so sorry.

      Hi kids!  I just posted on every frickin' BLog in the universe so I thought I would stop in and give y'all a shout on said universal tour.  NO WAY Z, THAT IS SO L337! Enjoy rockin' the burbs in your tryk'd-out rizzizle.  Heya Scott, welcome back. You're right, it has been a frickin'ly long while.  I dun care if he sees it, not like there's anything too hazardous on said wonderful BLog.  Oh Abby...you've reached the dark enlightenment. Rraugh! Everytime I think about school....well, I was going to say I want to cry or be an EMO kid and kill myself, but I've come to the point where I feel like I can still do good without pressuring myself over it. So school isn't so threatening as it has been the last eleven years. But you are right, none of that stuff matters. If you really think about it, what's the immediate practicality in algebra? If you're going to apply yourself to that kind of career, sure. But it's not like you're going to use it to fill out your W2s or to go on a scavenger hunt at the company picnic with the wife and kids and have to find the mystery variable to locate "a pink frisbee" or anything like that. "Let sleeping dogs lie" as to history...it's Greco-inspired BS, I just can't see how it would be quintessential to human existence to have to know about a bunch of fumbling idiots screwing the future. And  Low Rider ...well, let's just say if you'd learned it on the banjo it would be a lot more worth it, heheh. But teachers are incredibly gay and hellbent on self-preservation..."let's keep that work coming so we can make enough to get a Happy Meal at McDonald's some day".  WOW ARE TEACHERS COOL. Like Mr. Bastard.  Mr. Adams's isn't giving a curve this year...I feel really bad for Sarah Heines and Jonathan (kid who rides my bus and a huge Stranglebox fan (w00t!), taking Euro this year). But he says he needs to weed the boys from the men. And suddenly I remember that I have to take AP tests again and my life became horrible. After all that BS about "haha skool is gay & i dun care no more". BLAH.  And as to the last posts (if anyone hasn't notice, I responded to them backwards from my last one) from Linds and Rosie...please just remember that you can only do so much before it's too much. When you feel like you've nailed it while studying or solving a problem or something then STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, that's all you can do. And remember what the seniors last year said about burn-out. At least wait til mid-terms before you do, in the very horrible event of its happening.  No joke it's hard, but it's only as hard as you make it, and you could apply that to the whole world if you needed to.  Here's lookin' at you, kids.

      It's almost 10:00.  I'm still doing my homework.  I've never had so much in my entire life.  Usually I work for an hour, take a thirty minute break.  Dinner was my first break at 8:00 tonight, and I scarfed it in like 10 minutes and got back to work.  Who knew that people were telling the truth when they said Junior year was hardest?  Good thing I picked classes I really like...

      I don't really care.    I hate school.  I forgot that over the summer and then today, I walked in and realized that I hate it.  Oh, I always knew I hated FRA, but school in general sucks.  What's the point?  I'm not going to be needing to know how to find the area of a triangle or who signed the Declaration of Independance or how the hell to play "Low Rider" on the vibraphone.  Yeh, it sucks and my teachers are stupid and pile on the homework as if last year never ended.  Yeh, I had 58 math problems to do tonight, plus an essay for English and a "personal timeline" for history.  Boy howdy and thats only 3 classes.    Congrats Liz!!  I wish I had a car...but I don't...yeh...  Hudgins deserves to die.

      yeah, school's really boring, except for the homework, which is long and tedious.  sorry about not having the link up, but it was getting late and my mom was yelling for me to get in bed, so I figured yall were smart enough to figure it out.  Especially Scott, who was so wise to post it for me.  (Don't flex.)  Anyway, now I have a question for yall, and don't yell at me, but Michael wants the address to the blog.  Is that ok with everybody?  He doesn't want to post, just to read.  If you don't want him to just say so, but I told him I'd ask.

I'm having to do some quick mastering before the storm hits.  And by the way all...that's it. I'm done, no more recording. Allz I do is kick the tapes and they say, "So, how about 10 million?" and I say, "How about 50?", and they say, "Done!" Heheh. I'll see you on MTV dawgz. HAHAHAHA not really. We suck way too bad for that.  But I need to go finish mastering  I'm Just a Bastard  and then I'll have it all done.   AWW w00t! Shaddup shuttin'up.

That's subject matter for my own BLog, sorry all.   But yes, Coke just reminded me.  ABBY WAS THERE, YAY! It made my day. We talked to Loukimmel and that was rather interesting. But it was a good lunch, or in my case, fifty minutes of boredom. Until David Stanley asked if I could father Alex's children, to which I just sat there and thought, "that is the most random thing I've ever heard in my life". O well, kids will be kids.  Gonna go record afore ze sun, she sets. Tata buddies.

      Abby came to school today!!!  I'm very happy.  Yes, Ryan screwed my life up a bit, so I have every right in the world to at least  want  his to be the same way.  Most of it I don't really mean.  I'd like things to get better for him...yeah, I do... Um, what else?  Stupid psych quiz tomorrow.  Guess that means we're actually starting the school year now.  Hmm... Anyway, I'm trying to put off doing my homework as long as possible, but I think I better go now.  I'd make this longer but my mom spilled coke on this keyboard and it's hard to use the top row of keys and it's getting extermly annoying.  I'll hit a key on the top row and then a key on the middle row and the middle key will "strike" first.  ok, enough rambling.  homework.

      When it comes to Ryan, we can be as mean as we want.    Someone shoot me now.  I'm totally screwed.  I have to read another stinking book by Thurs and write 3 papers in the mean time.  I also have to go to the all school picnic and play my stupid band songs.  Wait, I have to go in 20 minutes, why the hell am I telling you this?  Nice seeing you guys btw...or, some of you guys...

      Hahahaha!!!  Yeah, definitely not the sanctuary, heaven forbid!!!  He would burn for eternity... heheh, now how could we lure him in there?  heheheh...  anyway, yeah, we were dressed exactly alike, just about it...even the shoes.    It was kinda cool, kinda dorky, but we couldn't help it, so we enjoyed it.  Can't wait to see the bed set, it sounds really cute.

      Ahh, Linds you forget to inform the masses, or at least the people on the BLog, that you and I were dressed exactly the same for Kickoff.  Yes, and the scarier part, we hadn't talked since 10:30 that morning, with no clothing disscussion at all.  We came dressed that way by pure chance...or the twin thing we've got going.  I think thats a good sign that we spend way too much time together.  So, I got a new bed set!  It's really cute...well, cute is not a good word there, more, better than it was.    Technically I don't think Ryan entered the Sanctuary, therefore God's wrath wouldn't have been implored to him because that is the holiest spot in the chuch.

      Ryan was at Kickoff.  Needless to say, I was not a very happy person, as Abby can attest.  She got pretty pissed at me at one point, but she had every right to, so it's ok.  Freaked me a bit, obviously, but I think I'm ok now.  Just hope he doesn't come next sunday and start back or something.  That sounds really awful, I know, and Scott will probably not like me saying that he shouldn't be in church, but he shouldn't be... what happened to being burned by the holy water, anyway?

Everyone look in the Williamson A.M. if you would like to see it...oh yeh, it should be there on Friday.  It kinda caught me off guard to say the least.

      Tisa had her baby.  It's a girl, named Kayleigh, both mother and daughter are doing well.  She was 7 lbs, 11 ozs. Her father was there for the delivery, who would have guessed?    For those of you who know about Katie, she's doing well, recovering consciousness every so often, enough to open her eyes but not to speak.  If you don't know about Katie, I'll post it later, cause I'm in kind of a hurry now.  Megan is getting married to Blake in October.  It's official, and it officially sucks.  Baby's still doing well as far as we know, which isn't much, but she's told us she will not be returning home.

      Oh, and if anyone wants to share homework assignments (Josh, Rosie) please feel free.  And Liz, remind your mom that dogs live longer, healthier lives if there are two of them together, even if they are different breeds.  If anyone is confused, go read Liz's Livejournal.  Wow, don't I sound like one of those annoying salespeople.

Sucks I don't see you more often to actually, I don't know, speak.  ;)  *whoosh*  ;)  Anyway, physics does indeed suck, but hopefully it will be my last science.    Talk to you guys soon.  Oh, Hi, Scott!  Thanks for reminding these guys of my address.  I appreciate it.  Good job!  As for Michael, I don't give a damn.  People with that name are not scoring well in my book as of late, if you catch my drift.  ~Z

      That's pretty damn good. The max for both is an 800...and since you pretty much p-frickin-wned the verbal, just work on ze maths a bit and you'll be jammin'.  But yes yes, that is very goot. I took the SAT in 7th grade and got an 1100 or something and they were flipping out, even tho a lot of other kids did hella better than me.  I was Seattle, hoo-ah! If that doesn't complete the "die from a heroin OD when I'm 30" bit, I don't know what does.     Congratulations, you're Seattle, the Emerald City.

      Leave it to Robin Williams to come up with the perfect plan... what we need now is for our UN Ambassador to stand up and repeat this message.   Robin Williams' plan...(Hard to argue with this logic!)   I see a lot of people yelling for peace but I have not heard of a plan for peace. So, here's one plan:   1. The US will apologize to the world for our "interference" in their affairs, past &present. You know, Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Noriega, Milosovich and the rest of those 'good ole boys.' We will never "interfere" again.   2. We will withdraw our troops from all over the world, starting with Germany, South Korea and the Philippines. They don't want us there. We would station troops at our borders. No one sneaking through holes in the fence.    3. All illegal aliens have 90 days to get their affairs together and leave. We'll give them a free trip home. After 90 days the remainder will be gathered up and deported immediately, regardless of who or where they are. France would welcome them.   4. All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and limited to 90 days unless given a special permit. No one from a terrorist nation would be allowed in. If you don't like it there, change it yourself and don't hide here. Asylum would never be available to anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers or 7-11 cashiers.   5. No "students" over age 21. The older ones are the bombers. If they don't attend classes, they get a "D" and it's back home baby.   6. The US will make a strong effort to become self-sufficient energy wise. This will include developing non-polluting sources of energy but will require a temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness. The caribou will have to cope for a while.   7. Offer Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries $10 a barrel for their oil. If they don't like it, we go some place else. They can go somewhere else to sell their production. (About a week of the wells filling up the storage sites would be enough.)   8. If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in the world, we will not "interfere." They can pray to Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement or whatever they need. Besides most of what we give them is stolen or given to the army. The people who need it most get very little, if anything.   9. Ship the UN Headquarters to an isolated island some place. We don't need the spies and fair weather friends here. Besides, the building would make a good homeless shelter or lockup for illegal aliens.   10. All Americans must go to charm and beauty school. That way, no one can call us "Ugly Americans" any longer.    Now, ain't that a winner of a plan.   "The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying 'Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses.' She's got a baseball bat and she's yelling, 'You want a piece of me?'"

      I've got it politically...  The north had better established gov'ts...didn't rely on counties like here in the good ol' south, we have "parishes" north o' Kentucky. The merchants were the driving political force since they had all the money and bluster.  Altho that's hardly saying anything about what kind of system they had...but that's what I know, so I hope that helps a bit. I need to go read, speaking of.  Tata chilluns.

      I was just jokin sheesh :p  Ok, well from what I know about US history.   The northern colonies:  Ecnomically: Depended more on importaing/exporting, lumber, and fabrication of stuff as opposed to farming as the southern ones farm.  Regligously: Northern was more puritan and quaker, and I believe, also Rhode Island was the only colony to not have a "offical" religon.  Educationally: North had schools, first colleges up north, first primer schools, etc. The south has community schools where tutors were paid to teach communitys of kids (since plantations were far apart) or teach one kid.  Politically: Not sure, I think they had different charters and what not.  I hope all that info is correct, just a few notes that I picked up in US history this year. Anywho, good luck

      That is so sad...    No, not  the  AP test, just a chapter test.  Speaking of, can anyone help me with the essay question: "Compare Northeastern and Southeastern colonies economically, religiously, educationally, and politically"?  I was there for the Southeastern ones, but I skipped out (ok, doc appt.) for the Yankee ones.  I really really really need help on it, so if anyone knows anything about it, call me ASAP.  I don't care what time it is.

      Liz, couple of questions.  But first a comment: I hate not being able to post on your site.  Ok, questions:  1) Have you seen Boy Meets Boy?  Kind of like Queer Eye.  Mrs. Duer got me started on it. 2.)  Why are you staying with Sandy?  That's kind of random.  3.)  When are you going to get around to calling me? :(  Ok, so I could call you if I ever thought about it.    And one final question posed to all BHS kids:  Yall want to go to the library tomorrow and study for this AP US Historyt  test?  Please?  That would be great.  That's all for now.  Except for I missed you at school today, Josh.  But Julian, Rob, and I had LOTS of fun without you. Pthththth!!! (That's me sticking my tongue out at you.  I figure that's a good way to spell it.

      Your dad sounds like mine.  Anyway, my English summary thing is only 12 sentences long (341 words).  Is that long enough do you think?  I hope it is...I'm not doing any more on it.  I just spent 2 hours doing that much.  I read the book in an hour, so I figured it would take less time to write the essay.  That was a freakishly easy book.  I want to see the Two Towers.  I love Gollum.  Good luck on everybod'ys piano.  Mine sucked when I played at church yesterday.  Probably cause I was sick though.  I got strep, not the kind where it makes your throat hurt though, it's kinda weird.  But anyway, it's caused my mono to flair up, so even though the strep is gone, the mono isn't.  So I'm gonna go take a nap.  G'night all.

      I'm sorry Linds.  I know these weeks are going to be tough, but I know you'll go through them with flying colors.  Huh, have you ever looked at that phrase?  "Passed with flying colors"...what the hell does that mean?  How can colors fly and why does it mean you've passed?  Yeh, um, anyway, back to my inspirational post, you can call me anytime and scream as loud as you want into my phone, using code names, of course.   And the whole anger thing, you can be mean, I can be meaner.  That's all you need to know, so I know that you won't be in bad moods around me, now, will ya?   And for the heak of it, I'm sorry everyone for...um...not going to your school.    Oh, speaking of screaming, I got to scream today AND it was recorded.  Boy howdy, I was in a recording studio before Josh.  Now thats just wrong.  But I really enjoyed it.  Now, for all the rest of the people on the BLog who are incredibly confused now, I was asked by my drama teacher to do this skit thingy for a company that sent CDs of their products out.  It involved a very 50's "Leave it to Beaver" skit thing at the beginning.  I played Peggy Sue, the older, sarcastic sister to Wilber, the equivalent to the Beaver.  It was fun, although the kid who played Wilber is really mean.  But other than that it was super fun, plus I got money, so that makes it a THOUSAND times better.    I'm sick of typing, so I'm going to go.

      While we're apologizing, I'm sorry to both Will and Rosie for biting your heads off in Kessler's room.  I still think I'm right, but yall weren't the ones who should have taken the brunt of my semi-tamper tantrum.    And a note to everyone:  I'm going to be really on edge these next two weeks.  Not only is Megan coming, but I'm starting on Prednisone, which makes me really angry really easily, and I explode at little things.  In fact, yall may just want to steer clear of me unless you think you can handle me being really mean.  And I'm going off medicine that I've been on for two years starting tomorrow so that's not really helping things either.  Just an FYI so yall can prepare yourselves.

      Ok everyone on this Blog (I think everyone...well the regulars anyway):  YOU ALL ARE COMING TO MY HOUSE ON SAT. SEPT 13, 2003 AT 5:30pm.  Ok, enough of the caps. But really I was ALL of you there/here/whatever because it wouldn't be the same without you ALL. Dinner will pizza (for those that constantly ask about food) and snacks and whatnot. Yea I haven't really planned...except for the fact that it's from 5:30 to whenever. Oh yea, Silly string, if I can get a hold of a massive amount of Silly string I do believe we'll have some fun with it in my backyard. AND bring your favorite movie or movies to fill in as background noise or just fill time.  Oh yea, if you guys expect cake...well you'll be disappointed... SO don't look for it...unless I get mad and decide to bake.  Ok I think that's it. If I'mm missing something (and I prolly am) just put the question here.

My power went out this morning at 7:30 and has yet to come back on.  I would like to look slightly decent for school tomorrow, why, I don't know and so my mom and I are here while my sis is in Atlanta and my father in NYC.  Wahoo...sort of...a little...no, not so much...no, not really at all...

      Man...having a license is so clich.  For us poor folk, the natural social obligation, and rung in the social ladder, is to go out, get a job, get money, and work our way into the world because that's what everyone else does, or did about a thousand years ago when they were sixteen. And if you really think about it, it's nice having a car, but at the same time it's a lot of junk too, like maintaining it, foremost, then, like, when mom wants some eggs or mayo, and she chrows (as in, "throws") you inna the car and sends you packing to the store.   It's interesting how unsurprised the store people are when you come in really late and buy weird stuff, tho. That makes sense, I guess.  But that wasn't the point. Blah, I forgot what it was. Driving's lost its flair with me. My parents made me drive everywhere with my permit so as to put the fear of God into me, I can remember not driving TWICE with my mom, which is whose I drive 99 percent of the time.   But HEY, you might get the one-armed man. Abby and I have seen the one-armed man. I took my test with him, he was cool, albeit a bit silent. I think he hates two-armed people tho, and the fact that he has a very low paying job showing stupid people how they suck at driving, talking to him in languages he doesn't understand most of the time (and that's not bigotry, that's fact) probably contributes to his loathing of the human race.  I made up a really big story about the one-armed man and how he lost his arm and thus detests the race of man and plans revenge upon humanity, and it sounded really good, but: 1. I forgot it, and 2. He probably just wasn't paying attention and got it stuck in a grinder or something. Not so epic as being punished by the Mongols after he took his special time machine back to the dynasty wars to avenge his ancestors, or something to that effect.  It was cool.  I had caffeine today and it shows. I never really make lots of and/or elongated posts much anymore ("thank God!" breathed the world) since I quit burning out. What a loser I am.  I like being cool, boy howdy.

      There was a guy at Chili's yesterday with a shirt that said "ARRR.  September 19 is National Pirate Day."  Didn't know it was actually true though.  That's awesome.  Though I wouldn't suggest the rape and plunder.  That's usually looked down upon.  And everybody check your e-mail ASAP.

      Ne'er do they grace the divine pages of this book. I had to say that Will was dead "for all intents and purposes", and have that translated as a death threat before he actually allocated a comment to the BLog.  Tomorrow is "Speak Like A Pirate Day", kudos to wonderful, talented Abby. So I expect everyone to be full pirate tomorrow, because I sure as hell will. Just watch me bust out the parrot and eye patch and cutlass and rape and plunder and everything. It'll be AWESOME!  Hoo-ah! Congratulations!

      I don't think it's totally a mind thing.  I eat  ALL  the time.  Most of you should know that, if you know anything about me.  And I DO NOT need to gain any more weight.  I'm proud to say that I reached 100 and plan to stay there, since that is almost the weight I was at 3 years ago.  So, there.  Of course I was being sarcastic.  Seriously, what did I say in one of my first posts on this blog?  THAT I'M SARCASTIC!!!  Michael wants you to call him at 8:30.  Yeh, so $300 in makeup?  I just got some new stuff, but it was, like, a buck.  Yeh, thats my family for ya.  And, its rubbing off on me.    I don't like Dr. Phil.  He's too opinionated for me...that sounds so wrong...

      It would make sense....also because I watch that show...indirectly...every...day...but yes, these people like to associate alleviating their pain with the pleasures of indulgence...hence they get really big and they can't stop themselves. The whole ancient conflict of not knowing what's really good for us. Blah blah blah. Dr. Phil has a pretty good show tho, he understands the hows and whys of people screwing themselves up, which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of "by the book" psycho-docs out there.

      Of course she was being sarcastic.  She feels about the same way you do about her and Holly both, with a little more hostility towards Holly than Becca, however.  Sorry about not coming tonight, Abby, but I was busy having the best day I've had in a while.  And Josh, sorry about not coming to MLK too, Mom said no, and I couldn't find you anyway, so... I didn't go, but I called your cell.  Anyway, best day in a while, yes.  Ok, so I went to my second favorite place in the whole wide world (first place being Abby's house, obviously.  Or on a cruise.  Definite Tie.)  Anyway, so second favorite place is the mall, another obvious one.  Mom surprises me with a makeover at the Clinique counter and $300 worth of makeup.  Wow.  Guess I should take that as a hint I guess, but whatever.  I'll wear makeup for a makeover anyday.  So if I look all spiffy tomorrow, you'll know why.   Then we went to look at stereo systems for my birthday.  Very nice.  I'm either getting a 5-disc changer Panasonic or 3-disc changer JVC.  I don't know.  Maybe something else just as nice.  Then we went out to eat at Chili's, where I had a lovely conversation with Rosie (by the way, don't let me forget to take you home tomorrow.  Meet me by the Campbell Center.)  And then I came home.  So I forgot my problems for a little while.  Oh, and I got Dr. Phil's new book about weight loss.  Turns out that for my height and bone structure, I'm the right weight. w00t.  Abby, you need to gain some weight fast.  Whit is gaining on you.  And Rosie and Liz, yall are obviously fine.  As for the guys, I have no idea.  I didn't look yall up.  Ok, so no word on Meggie.  Keep Praying.

Well, I'm going back to Nashville Rescue Mission to present them with yet another $1000 check.  Man, I thought I was done with that whole food drive thing.  My parents think that they might offer me a job sometime soon.  Then I go straight to handbells.  Wahoo, what fun.  An hour spent with my 2 favorite people, Becca and Holly.  I can't wait.  Oh joy.  Please stop me before I explode from the excitement.  Yeh, at least Emily, Betsy and Frances are going to be there.  That should make it a little better.  Then the service (haha, I NEVER go to that anyway) and youth group.  Please come Linds.  It'll give us some good "catching up" time.  We have a lot to talk about.  Then home.  Food.  Homework.  Bed.  Yay.  I cannot wait.    Any word from Megan?

      The only thing anyone can do now is pray.  And yes, I know how weird that sounds coming from me.  Dear Lord, we have tried everything in our power.  But she's 18, and even if she wasn't, her parents won't let us do anything that might make her mad.  My Uncle Dennis (not her dad) literally tried to kidnap her once, but even that didn't work.  Don't think we haven't tried.  We have.  We've done everything in our power.  That's why she was here.  We didn't exactly want her here, but she was welcomed with open arms because we thought it might help.  We've literally gone from one extreme to the other and back, from taking a firm stand against her seeing him and all that, to completely not caring, hoping that it was a control issue, and we've tried taking middle ground.  None of it has worked.  She's back with Blake and she didn't even want to be, really.  She just wanted to go home before she went to Tisa's.  And now she may never come back.

      Dear lordy.  I know this isn't any of my business, nor am I expecting someone, especially you, Linds, to get involved in any fashion, or more than you expect of yourself, rather, but it doesn't sound like this is safe being let alone. Speaking from familial experience (and I could go on for days, being more long-winded than I normally am...and  that's  an accomplishment), this kind of thing can continue and escalate until it's less a crisis and more a disaster.   But again, I'm only throwing down the seeds, not trying to cultivate a crop. Really, it seems well nigh impossible to actually do anything about the situation from here...I thought I should just bring it to the table and see what we all have to say about it.

      Blake took Megan last night.  She agreed to meet him for dinner, and when her dad came back to pick her up (they took away her car a long time ago) she was nowhere in sight.  So he heads to Blake's house, and they're riding down the road in Blake's truck, with Megan crying in the front seat, and Blake's dad (a convicted child molester who has also put a $10,000 life policy out on Blake and his brother and then hired someone to have them killed) was behind them to make sure Megan didn't get out.  When my uncle got there, she had been beat around pretty bad, but she wouldn't come with him.  We think he threatened her pretty bad.  He's really mad because Tisa (the other one who just had a baby) saw him at a football game the other night and embarrased him in front of his friends and because Megan left without his permission and wouldn't talk to him and stuff.  We have no idea where Blake took her, nor do we know if she's still alive.  So yeah, my family's really screwed up right now.

It was kind of hectic though, cause no one had the same legislation, so we had to debate about what we were going to debate about.  It was insane.

      Man, and the BLog was all alive and craaaazy for a couple o' days there...  Oh...ghastly death it be, what for to be shell'd within a ennui-filled perdition. Staying with the G-Parentals isn't ever on the top of the list, especially for more than a day...well, at least my craaazy redneck ones down south, YEEHAW! My grandmother is frickin' nuts, and it makes me want to, like, SCREAM AT HER, "STOP BEING SO DAMNED PSYCHOTIC!!! RRRRAAAAAUUUGGGHHH!!!!" Heh. Eagh, please survive Abby Mac, only two days, two days, two days.

      So, yeh. I'm not so sure I like this whole "parents-being-out-of-town-so-i-have-to-stay-at-my-grandparents" thing.  Its not so fun, but whatever.  Not much I can do about it now.  Oh well.    Good to see that people have posted lately.

          My inner child is sixteen years old!    Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Aww w00t.      My inner child is six years old!    Look what I can do!  I can walk, I can run, I can read! I like to do stuff, and there's a whole big world out there to do it in.  Just so long as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my three best friends with me, of course.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    And here I was worrying about being old...not that I'm not, but that's a really good morale booster tharr.

      5 points to Ravenwood.  According to the scoring of football, I'd love to have seen how they would have pulled that one off.

      So, where can I buy the new Barbiedolls?  Wal-Mart?  or Dollar General?    And, yeh, so, anyway.  Deech is an ass-hole and that's about it.  Although I don't technically have to beat him up myself, I still would like the glory of it.  How about a nail-bat as weapon of choice?  Oh, and by the way, Linds.  We get to beat up Pat too.  I'll explain later.    And I don't want to take a 15-minute survey, thank you very much.

So if anyone would like to see me bust my ass/head on solid concrete, come to the B Hall before school! You can't miss us! I'll be the one screaming at the top of my lungs (like I do every morning) with long hair and an EMO kid, marijuana-like-induced, drawl!   Yeepin, tomorrow is going to pwn azz0r. And as for Abby...I'M SORRY! I shouldn't be talking about cool slacker stuff for those of us who aren't going to be in on it. In her stead and defense, "nobody posts anything relevent on here".  DI, w00t. When are we starting?   And   That   Is   All   Man, I'm really abusing my HTML privlidges and I have no life whatsoever. I just got back from running so I feel like I can move at about nine million miles an hour, which I am, in fact, doing as I type this post, at only a slightly decelerated rate.

      Heheheh. That's all pretty accurate. For the Dickerson Road there should be more about crack and smack, and STDs. The one they gave cooresponds more for Ken.  If you've ever seen a Dickerson Road whore, you'll know what the Barbie version really should look like. And you've probably laughed really hard simultaneously. I know I do everytime my dad and I pass them.

      Don't worry, the both of you. While you all sit back and enjoy a drink compliments of the Ringside, I'll be killing Deech with projectile weapons and other such nuances of much-deserved abuse. And of course, I'll hold him down and let you all have turns with him for being a stupid ass, with a weapon of your choice, and suits to prevent his befilthed blood from spoiling your clothing.   Good job Deech, you really screwed with the wrong group.  Abby, don't forget culinarily-endowed, Spinning Song-etiquetted, and brilliant. The rest is also absolutely correct.

You know, I'd rather not talk about it anymore.  I'm strangely not that mad today.  So, yeh, but Linds, you might want to be there the next time I see Deech, you know, to hold me back from beating the shit out of him and all.  Happy day-after-your-Sweet-16, Linds!

      *blush*  Thanks, yall.  I really figured I'd feel all different now, but I really don't.  Got some really cool stuff though.  Whit got me a Brentwood Bruins afghan, which is completely cool, and my parents got me insurance, and a 5-disc cd changer for my room.  It's JVC, and it's the size of my dresser.  It's one of those 3-piece sets- it's got subwoofers and everything.  I just learned what that was today, so I'm using it as often as I can.  And then Abby brought me MINI MILANOS!!!  How cool is that?  She is so sweet...  All in all, this has pretty much been the best birthday ever, except for the whole psych paper.  And the thing at youth tonight, but that's another story that Abby can tell if she wants to.  And so, I'm going to go read the Scarlet Letter *cough sparknotes cough*  I can't help it- I'm lazy.    Oh, and Reiners got tickets to the Guster concert on Friday, so I'm going with him.  SWEET!!!  Hope Michael doesn't mind that one...Oops.  Oh well, it's not a date, so it doesn't count.  w00t!!!  GREAT birthday, all.  GREAT birthday.

      That is very true.  Using my masterful arts of subterfuge...or autism, depending on if I took my meds or not...I'll...be sneaky?!? Notice the "?!?" ? That means I have no idea what I'll do. I've been practicing on the bus with my sister in the mornings. I'll pull my hoodie over my eyes and say, "Am I incognito?"  And she's like, "Yeh, but I can see your hair."  CRAP .   So   yes.  We  shall  see,  friends.   That's cool, Rosie, w00tw00t to !|\|73r@c7! Have fun!

      Truly, somehow. Using the "black hooded" disguise. And apparently, this will be a task requiring all my guile and effort.  Why would I want to go to a game at my own school? One of no significance, no less?  I agree, who  does  give a real shit? And if you do...\/\/|-|@7 @ 100z3r$@(_)r(_)$! That says, "what a loozersaurus!" in L337.

      That does make sense, Abby. And I hear that, Linds. But I dunno. It's the laymen's pianist taint, especially if you know how to play "Heart and Soul", and that gets transferred umbilically through the womb, I do believe.

      Actually, yeah, it was in their basement, finished basement, but basement all the same.  But it wasn't really accessible to play for a while, and none of the family knew how to play, so only company ever played it.  So it kind of makes sense.
      
</post>

<date>06,October,2003</date>
<post>

    
       
      I totally agree.  Except on the whole "Heart and Soul."  I think its more an occasion for, um...well, I don't know, but you know what I mean.  Linds is probably the only person who could tell me what song I would play if I saw a piano, and I didn't tell her what I was going to play.  Does that make any sense whatsoever?

      New ones are incredible. I still can't believe the whole "yah 10 hours ever" deal. Wouldn't they see it while walking by and want to screw around with it? I mean, c'mon, a rousing bout of "Heart and Soul"? What, was the guy keeping it in his broom closet?  And many more irrelevent questions that don't need to be answered, or much less pondered to any extent.

      I got a new piano a couple of minutes ago.  It's a flat black, 6 foot, 1981, baby grand Kawai.  It is the most beautiful thing I've ever laid eyes on.  It has the best touch; kinda stiff, but really it just needs to be broken in.  It's only been played 10 hours in its whole life.  It'll be here in about two weeks.  I love my Daddy.  He paid a buttload for it.  Oh, and if anyone wants an antique piano, ours is for sale for $1000.

      A separate escalator for your cart?!? (using Josh's signature punctuation there)  This I have to see.  And because it seems to be the trend to say so, even though I already have done so a couple of times, Happy Birthday, Liz.  And brown is a mix of red and green.  Black is the absence of color.  White is all colors together.

      That is very true. This quiz is especially malinformed. I mean...brown...for Abby...and the implications thereby...really frick'n off, it's like shooting yourself in the foot with a target a foot in front of you. If that makes any sense. And I got yellow, which is...god forbid...Joy. Because while eminating bitterness and resentment of self and environment from day to day, I always take a minute to smell the daisies and give off an aura of energy and happiness. Nay. If there's a brown one, let me be it.  I used to be black, anyway, and blue (I think that was melancholy, or pensive, I can't remember) at one point. They've changed the questions waaay up, tho.  Tho I did enjoy the evil quiz, because all of my little stati things were slightly over the evil side, except for the "blackhearted" one...in which, I was a crutch-kicking, baby-candy-taking, pilfering vagrant. Leave it to a bunch of second-hand psychologists to exploit the evil in man and then make him enjoy it. Or to exploit the not-true in man and make him believe it. I actually thought I was a creature of sunshine for a moment there.   Bah.

      It changes with every "important" word you put in.  Words that, according to their equation, equals 13 (or a multiple of) or 7 (or a multiple of).  Or it could be that you didn't put in the web address.  You have to hit "Analyze another site or passage" and then type in the web address to this site (www.lindseysrants.blogspot.com) to be able to see the real "evilness."  Right now we're at 76% good, 24% evil, which is kind of disappointing, but still better than Josh's.

      I went to Kentucky- sorry about not telling yall about that.  Good memory, Josh.  See, you're not so old.  Oh, and I fell in love with UK, so I may be going there.  Got the possibilities up to three now:  Auburn, Georgia, and Kentucky.  Wow.  Biggest Pro: Michael can go there if he gets a schoarship.  And here's how easy it is- I can get a scholarship.  You only have to have a 3.3 GPA and a 28 ACT or 1240 SAT, which both of us have.  w00t.  Mrs. Luchsinger taught us how to play bridge last year in Study Hall.

      Aye lad, that's true. It was quite a random and "ummm...."ing sort of post.  I was the only one who posted this whole weekend. How irrelevent.  I'm sorry Abby! But it's not that cool. For the majority 'o us, it'll be spent reading supergroovy books and doing nothing. Linds was at...a college. I hesitate to say which one. It was in Kentucky tho...I think?!? Stupid selective memory.  I dun even know how to play Bridge. But that is awesome. You tend to whup up them in everything. Don't you think they'd learn to quit? Abby always wins. And four digit numbers always give me the "wow that's incredibly high" complex, so tharr be a double bonus.   It's ten 'o clock and I'm tired. Hell...it's horrible to be old.

Wow, playing bridge with my grandparents on a saturday night.  Now, thats living.  (Besides the fact that I whipped my entire family's ass while playing -- 1030 points to some other lower scores.  I won.  How sad is that?)

      "What is this feelin' takin' o-vah? Thinkin' no one could open tha doah..."  Kelly Clarkson...ah, friends. Yes, this is really random, perhaps vaguely homosexual. Actually, it  is  homsexual (I'm sorry, Abby! heheh). But she's blaring away upstairs, and has been fo-eva, fo sho, at least all weekend, and all week. So I'm pretty much a Kelly Clarkson aficionado at this point.    Ok, that last line really scared me. I'm going to purge this vile sin of pop music from my veins now. And now that really whorish "I Wanna Be Bad" song is playing.  Life with a 14-year-old diva aspirant est tres bad.  Thisall post was entirely irrelevent and not intended to have any meaning past killing braincells (a lot, I'm thinking). I don't even know why I'm making it, come to think of it. I don't know why I'm still making it.  O, yeh. It was the Cherry Cokes from earlier. HAHAHAHA.   Irrelevently yours.

      HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!  Yeah, definitely don't look up dingleberry.    Don't worry, Josh, I have acid reflux too.  Did the whole "eating a camera & drinking chalk" thing when I was four.  It sucks.

      Oh CRUNK! Dingleberry est rad! They really need to put it in the dictionary. I'm going to look it up right now...  HAHAHAH. My my. The dictionary is full of wonderful things. Don't look it up, by the way. Just don't.  My god. The prognosis is acid reflux to the extent of death, pretty much. Remember how I used to talk about the "burning" that I would get around my heart when I was upset, back in the EMO days of, say, 12 months ago? It was actually acid creeping in during times of stress. So getting rid of it will, in effect, get rid of a lot of depression problems (they gave me Nexium, the little purple pill...everyone seems to know it when I say "the little purple pill", so hopefully that will help).  It also explains why I'm such a liquid Nazi, especially when it comes to Cokes. Every time I drink one, it stops the burn for a few minutes. Altho I sort of took it to the addict level. And the acidics in the Coke made the acidics in the pit worse. Hence, seriously, no more carbonation.  Speaking of addict...OPIUM.   I think that's all that need be said to that effect. Sharing...hahahahahahhahahahaha. Oh, my. It's a good thing I'm/we're not (a) druggie(s). What a confusing grammatical psychobabble. Today was "it's time to stop being high, faggot" day. That means I had to come back down and touch earth. Damn.   The drugs apparently didn't work because of all the caffeine...I drank so much Coke that I've stimulated my body to tolerate heavier substances. I don't blame them, but I wasn't too keen on the getting the hell ripped out of my throat part because they didn't know what else to do with some kid gagging to death. Shit, they acted like this had never happened before.  And I got my just desserts for Helen Kellering. Aye.

Josh, I can't believe you woke up.  That has got to be traumatizing.  You deserve more drugs just for that.  Sharing is nice too ;)  Rosie, I wasn't  going to say I told you so, but then I figured I may never have another chance to say it. In light of all that, I told you so. And also, they shoved a camera inside of Josh to see what's wrong with his stomach.  Scott, Abby was being sarcastic.  It's a little too early to assume Rosie's mom might be turning her into a girl.  And just for Josh's and Abby's reading pleasure, I was reading a book last night, and it used the word "dingleberry" about 10 times.  I laughed so hard I cried.

Ok so Gunter needs to become unpig-ish and Josh needs to get of the durgs. People that don't really know me need to stop bad-mouthing me and talking about putting drugs in my food. Zabeth needs her voice back and I need my sanity.   Josh get better...NOW. So what's up with the drugs?  You know how my mom has said that I'm not going to prom...I think things have just changed. She ot me a dress last week...she got me another one yesterday...hmm... I think she's trying to turn me into a girl...

      Yeah. It was a load of fun. I just wish I could go back for more.  And if I could put that last sentence in very small letters so as to denote my sarcasm, I would certainly do it.  If you want to know at least thirty more reasons why I should never have any opiates, you should have been at Vandy Out-patient today. The first thing I said when I woke up was, "I need s'more of that shit."  Actually, I said that more because I woke up during the proceedure and all the meds wore off. Oops! I don't think there is a pain quite like the feel of a giant metal tube in your guts. So, of course, they had to give me more to counter-act my waking up...heheheheheh. So I've been sleeping all day and am probably going to go back and get s'more right now (sleep, that is).  gnite for now, all

      To tell you the truth, and I am now probably going to be killed, I could care less who wins the World Series.   I mean, yeh, I wanted the Cubs to go, but now that that whole saga is over...In the words of the great Cary Grant/ Rhet Butler: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."  Short, sweet and sarcastic.  The story of my life.    Welcome back Will!  My aunt and uncle should be about half-way to China now!!!  YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!!!

      The Cubs thing was seriously pissing-offing, but...considering the number of "aww, that was close"es the Cubs have got in the last, say, 20 years...sadly, almost no surprise.  I think it's the fact that I'm so freakingly high-strung and blitzed on adrenaline all the time, Abby. And being a staid pessimist helps, too. We had to answer questions in relation to their happening in the last six months, or probably happening in the next six months. And I was able to check both boxes for most of them, so double the pointageness. Double my pleasure, double my fun!  I don't feel stressed too much. I still interpretive dance to  Break On Through  by The Doors during Al the Gebra (which was a great book by the way), and do massive cartwheelage during lunch! And I breakdance and freestyle in the mornings, when necessary. So I feel I even out the other stuff, like never doing homework, never studying for les examens, and the like.  And to everyone, even in horrid, horrid places like FRA (SO SO SO sorry, Abby Mac...getting the reinforcements in there soon), interpretive dancing is  the solution  to the dour, life-sucking gloom of the classroom. That rhymed, "gloom" and "...room". Rad. But yesss, I know everytime I "break on thru to the other side" or "come on baby, light my...fiiiiiiiiyuuurrr" I feel psyched up.    A lot of the English stuff is subjective. You have to think like they do or you are killed. Ass-rat SAT BS. It should be shot in the face with a large gun and run over by a herd of cattle.   I got hurt pretty bad a few minutes ago and took some pain killer. Ergo, randomness.

      I actually didn't stress too much about the PSATs.  But that could be because I'm on so many drugs right now.  I haven't felt much of anything since we got back from Kentucky.  What subjective stuff does the PSAT have that the SAT doesn't?  And welcome back to the boards, Will.  Abby and I were just talking about your "being dead" again.  I wish the Marlins would win, but I doubt they will.  I really wanted the Cubbies in it, though.  It broke my heart when they lost.  I was on the phone with Michael when it happened (almost in tears, btw) and he was like "Hey, it's just baseball.  Don't cry.  No, I'm serious.  Don't cry.  I'm really bad with that.  Please don't cry.  Please?!?"  So I waited till I got off the phone ;)  Ok, so I didn't cry, but I came close.  I was very disappointed to say the least.  My mom actually did cry.  My dad may have too, but he's in Chicago, so I can't tell for sure.  But his voice broke when we were talking about it, a sure sign that he was indeed crying.    But, now that they're out, I'd rather a semi-southern team beat a Yankee team- wow, who would've thought they would have been so creative with naming the team?  And again, Abby, whoa.  I can't believe it's Samantha.  We were so right!!!

      I had a 730 on the stress thing, after the little reduxi we got to patch in (it was upwards of 900 before). I'm probably going to drop dead any second according to that.  2-story Kroger?!? I'm telling you man...B-wood=the VERY short end of the stick, when it comes to mass marketing. I guess they compensate by putting two of the same store three feet apart. And sure it's not the same, but hell...we would be simply groovy and rad. That should be a part of the new 7 Wonders of the World, then they could have pictures of it and I wouldn't need to keep thinking about it, I could just stare at the both of them and be amused.  Woo, scratching head befuddledly, there's my spot of autism for the day.  Linds, it's prolly purdy obvious, but for where wert ye today?

      Actually to explain all that. I had to take art last year and one of our projects was to draw an animal where we couldn't use brown or black. I did a fox so for the ears and the tail I had to mix my own "black" out of color pencils so...that's how I know how. Some of the coat was brown so I had to do the same for that.  Yes Josh...my stress level in Psych was 530. Andrew Bryant's was like 10

      Chinese food  is  really good. Along that line, I don't think I've ever seen a Chinese restaurant that has MSG in their stuff. Perhaps they do and just say they don't; they probably do put MSG in, actually. In any event, it's all still really sodium-filled and 100% Dee-lish!  Altho I just had pizza and I'm really full. Thinking about food at this point would make me sick.  Thought processes on display...interesting?!? You can find out a lot about someone by how they think. Altho all Rosie's told me is that she need a life, and she needs one FAST. And I think she called someone a "fox"; quite antediluvian, only contributing to the "you need a life" deal. And she's overanalytical. I mean, it's black, who da hell keers whether it's more purple or not. But if that is true, I think I'll be setting my wardrobe on fire. Or just enjoy it, seeing as how ghey I am.  I find it more fun to think about endlessness or nothingness. Since it's not remotely humanly perceivable, it gives me a really whacked out, "whoa...life is awesome/ghey" feeling.  Sweet. I'm going to go think about nothing now...literally. It's going to be whacked out. I said I was going to experiment with fingerpaints and I wasn't kidding, and now I'm going to have fun thinking about human-planarly impossible stuff.

      Wow--Rosie's thought process, on display for your own viewing pleasure.    Happy Birthday Liz--cause in my last post, I never actually said it.  And its probably late now.  Happy Belated Birthday Liz.  Unless it's not late and everyone was just considering it a "Birthday Weekend,"  in which case, it could be today.  So, Happy Birthday. But if its a "Birthday Weekend," then it coud've been yesterday, which would make it late.  Happy Belated Birthday Liz.  I suppose, also it could've been Friday, because that's when Scott's post was, which makes it really late.  Happy Really Belated Birthday Liz.  Man, I want some chinese food.  Yup.  So, college life is fun.  I played cards with a bunch of people last night until about 1:00 AM, then got a movie from this really creepy guy, watched some of it and then decided it was really stupid and made no sense whatsoever.  Then I went to bed about 2- 2:30, something like that and got up today at 1 in the Afternoon.  And thats early on a Sunday to get up.  Seriously, my sister and I were walking around and there was like NO ONE there. It was weird.

      well aren't we a happy bunch...  ok here we go,  Rosie, Abby disliked your harsh method of showing your disapproval of Lindsey's private life.  All I ask, and i think Abby will agree with this, is that you express you concerns, not attack the person.  Also I believe that Abby just didn't want to have to deal with school here and at school, she wasn't attacking you, as your reaction would show, but just reacting against school. (by the way its The Souls of Black Folk: Forethought;  Chs  1-5;  Chs  8-10;  Ch  14;Up from Slavery: pgs 1-50 (Chap 1-6)  and Ch 14 , if you're going to give her assignments at least give her the right ones)   Abby, I'm not really sure how to, or even if you need to, calm you down.  Rosie has backed off on her anti-Michael campaign, and if her reaction (to basically nothing) seems overworked, it's probably not you, it's probably something else.  so... if that covers it all, go back to you lives citizens  PS Rosie, if you really feel the need to get mad at someone, why don't you get mad at someone you communicate better with.

      I don't remember being mad...but you know, I was on so many drugs at one time, that I just don't have the same memory anymore.  I used to know a bunch of French cuss words.  But I'm not in that class anymore, so I like to forget everything I learned in there because Mr. Climer needs to go away.  Not that I learned cuss words in French class...oh, wait.  I did, but thats besides the point.  My sister taught my them and I don't like to have anything to do with French anymore cause I never have to take it again in my life.  Maybe.  There's always college.  Yuck.  I don't really want to go to college.  Because after college, there's work.  Lots of it.  And then you die.  Yeh, ok, sure there's retirement in between the work and dying but, not much because to be able to retire comfortably, you have to retire old, like mid-70's/80's.  Which assumes I'll even be alive then.  I'll probably die from like a heart attack or something during the Master Chef competition.  Talk about rambling.

      It's all the same no matter what I do. I don't really ever do that so perhaps you understand the wonderful underlying emotion.  Plus, Finnish cusswords are ghey. They're more geared towards representing bad things like "monkey's behind" rather than just coming out and saying, "apeass".  Hahaahahah.

      Wow.  What happened?  I missed something completely apperently.  Namely where Abby was offended, never saw that post.   Rosie gave me the assignments I asked for (thank you by the way, saved me a lot of time) and then we started talking about Abby's thumb (hope it's feeling better, btw).    So what happened?  I'm going to fix this real quick.  Abby, Rosie apologizes for whatever she did that upset you (You were mad? You've got to tell me these things when I talk to you!) (And Rosie, it wouldn't hurt you to actually apologize.  I'll respond to the stuff on the other blog there, cause I've definitely got some things to say there.)  Rosie, Abby accepts your apology.  Josh, we're not supposed to call friends "ass"  Use something more discreet like "butt" or "donkey" whichever you meant it to be.  Or call her something in Finnish.  She'll never know.

      Aie, Abby Mac! You've told about thisall, but still. It's not everyday one talks so lightly about steel-imbued paper lopping at one's unawares thumbs. I know, it's hard to, like, even play Tiddilywinks with any more-than-mediocre injury. And it's excellent to hear that you're ok! Just remember: no matter how much it doesn't hurt, that green colour doesn't mean beansprouts are popping up. Altho it would be weird/awesome simultaneously, if that were to happen.  Man, crimeny.   I think we have a flexational on Wednesday, Linds. Yes.   Makkara, miksi?

      NO SCHOOL ON THE BLOG!!!  (especially for those who don't go to BHS)  I've decided that it's really hard to do a lot of stuff without your right thumb.  Try it.  Seriously, like every time I use it, its like pain, so I don't.  If  you want hard, try playing the vibes with a latin beat and no thumb.  Yah...  Oh, um, the thumb, yeh, yesturday I was in the mall volunteering at the Vandy Children's Hospital display thing and it was really ugly, so I decided to make it not ugly and was re-arranging stuff when I looked down at my thumb and there was a large gash from which blood was coming out.  I was kinda like "oops." And went to my mommy, who for the first time in my life, didn't have a band-aid, so I had to go to the lady who was at the little cart rental place, like, 5 feet from the display.  She was really nice.  I've never seen a more well-stocked first aid kit.  Come to think of it, I've never seen a stocked first aid kit.  Kinda defeats the purpose,  doesn't it?

      Well, the hole hast devoured yours truly.  My ear is, like, constantly blocked now.  And it was doing better earlier...go figure.  I was practically useless at choir sectional tonight, but...yeah.  So, anyway, my dad has gone to new heights to show that he is a prick.  Want info? Ask me later.  And keep your eyes peeled on the LiveJournal.  I agree about the holes.  I have one black sock with TWO holes in it.  I always say that I kicked a vampire in the mouth.  ;)  Yeah, so if you see me tomorrow, unless I tell you differently...try to talk into my right ear. Laters!  ~Z  Who is MC?  This post is nearly identical to the one on Antiphilanthropy, because posting here didn't work at first...oh, well.  Laters.

      Yeehaw MC. That stupid prude.   I'll give her one thing: she's the perfect example of a person that needs to be shot and run over by a herd of mutated spider beasts with knife-feet and dripping iodine glands.  Past that, she should just be shot and run over by a herd of mutated spider beasts with knife-feet and dripping iodine glands. And degraded, pointed, and laughed at. If nothing else, at least the last part. Doesn't everyone know by now? She's Abby. MC isn't proving anything by taking the part, she's just 1. wrong, and 2. shotgun fodder.  Kyll! Hn on tyhm ja tyls! Ruma laiska likainen kassi!! (which says, "Yes! She is stupid and boring! Ugly lazy dirty bag!!")

      You know, I've not had the best experience with holes.  They are always there, never going away.  Expecially in socks.  I'll get a pair of socks and, like, the next day, there'll be a hole.   Ok, so I've actually never had a hole in the sock.  I just thought a story like that would be appropriate for such a subject.    Ok, so I'm going to turn strange on you guys again and become really perky.    Hey y'all.  (Yes, Linds.  Y'all).  Wanna come on out to my schools production of "Rumors?"  It's really neato mosquito man.  And the makeup is spectacular!  It would make me so darn happy if we could sit in the back cursing MC for taking my part!  Yeh, after reading that, it's not very perky.  Oh well.  I tried.  Sorta.  Kinda.  Ok, not so much.  Yeh, not really at all.

And speaking of god...Abby is fricking pwning that right hand and shall be pwning the left in due time. It's only the most complicated thing I've ever heard in the span of sixteen years....that's why I'm a rap-rock guitarist.    Speaking of thorazine....everyone, find me some before I murder my English teacher in ice cold blood. She makes me want to set myself on fire...well, no. She more make me want to set her on fire.  And for those of you that don't know, I'm under suspicion of plagarism because my writing in one paper is "not like the others," and my speech was "antiquated". What the hell?!? Somebody must not be reading my schtick very well. And anyway, since her stupid "find me a cheater" machine didn't turn anything up, *the bird*. I really don't even see where she has the right to say that...as if I care. I'm just there for the grade. Bottom line is:  I  wrote it, so  fuck this .  Yeh I'm pissed. This is the second time this has happened to me, and last time I was the one leaving with a black eye...three of them, numerically. But I passed that class and by the good lordy if I don't pass this one and laugh my ass off when I do.  RRAUGH. Done.

I will, I just needed to rant.  Speaking of auditions, I'm working on those piano pieces (I think only Josh and Linds know about this, so everybody else, be really confused.  Right now).  And I think I finally have the beat down on the right hand.  Now I just have to tackle the left.  Wahoo, what fun.  Handbells tonight.  Even more fun.  Please, make me stop jumping up and down in pure excitement about seeing ALL my favorite people tonight.  Please.  Seriously.  Make me stop.

      What's really sad is that I understood what he just said.  I wrote 6 pages, too, though, in the end, and I knew about it, so I guess that makes me defiant and not just uninformed.    I'm not so fond of sunflower seeds.

      Damn that woman. I'm sorry, but damn her. You just can't write Poe without being verbose. Hell, his words are so damned long. I could stint on ennebreation and emulsify one utterance in complex verbalization that would elongate the sentence to no end, using but a trifling of the massed, nigh-tangible intricacies of the craft. That sentence was only big cuz the words were about three miles long apiece. Damn her.  Wish I had known before I went and wrote about six pages beforehand. Oh well, it'll give you all something to look at and go, "We knew it all along" when they institutionalize me.  Damn it, I like sunflower seeds, they are excellent.  ( These morsels of flower that long only for light and natural benediction taste as ambrosia, tantilizing and enthralling my sense of taste with their Promethian benipulsification . Damn Poe. I just made up a word, if anyone noticed.)

      Yeah, what he said.  Only not as sadistic and gory.  How bout just a plain old "Please try out for the part, if not for me, so that you can shove it in MC's face?"  Yeah, that's nice.  I'm going to bed.  Poe wears me out. (English assignment for you non-BHSers out there)  I'm 5 pages, which is 3 too many, but she can get over it.

      Really. Is it worth longing after the part if ya won't even go for it? And imagine the look on MC's face if you make it...I would pay...ok, not too much at all, perhaps five cents if it happened to be on hand, because she is worthless filth?!?...but there would be money and a Polaroid all over that one. And a shotgun.  "I can't believe it! Mr. Compton, there must be some mistake!" (pale and aghast, eyes filled with over-pouring tears and malaise) "No mistake you whiny whore, Abby's it for this part...I don't even know why I kept picking you all this time, I think you must have put drugs in my drinks or something, you sound like a cow in heat being eaten alive by a pack of rabid chihuahuas, and your acting reminds me of the last time I went to the monkey cages at the zoo. Abby's hitman boyfriend, come take out this trash." (looking up from butchering Jerry, a clicking of shotgun shells) "Hurray. Fun." (with absolutely no expression or tone) (laughter resounding thereafter)  And if not that, we could always take to being verbose about everyone's being stupid, especially ________ (insert high school career-dramatist/gay liar drama department guy here).  So I would say yes, Abigail McLemore, it's worth a shot.   Ha ha ha. Shot. Someone's in a sadistic mood tonite.

      Not for me, thanks though.  MC is the girl who is able to conform to any theatrical part ever invented.  Let's see, she played a little serial killer women, a young jewish girl, an insane cook, and some other things that are too hard to describe.  The amazing thing is, that all of her characters seem exactly the same.   AND we're doing Guys and Dolls for the musical, and guess what?  In my hallway eves dropping it has been determined that MC will play Sarah and Anne-Marie will play Adalaine.  Yeh, so basically, the two leads.  Whats the point in even attempting? Wahoo, makeup here I come.

      Skipping back a post, yuppin, I remember Indiana kid, Mitch. Meggie, in this instance, is said while thinking about walking through a puddle of hydrochloric acid and glowing mutant snails from outer space.  Hmm. It's times like this I remember why the south still has guns en masse.

      O shit, married (shocked disbelief, not checking your spelling)?!? How did you all come across this fact? And I'm assuming nothing's changed in which person it is. There is only one word for this. Well, three. " what the hell ". Not as a question, either. I'm just saying what the bloody hell.  More than pissed Linds, fothermucking about to KEE-UL somebady. That is some shit if I've ever heard it.   Hell. I forgot what I came here to do. Check email, that's it. And the BLog always happens to follow.  So...I've got guns. Who's up for a nice trip to Meggie's?  *click*

      People with loose morals, like say... my boyfriend?? Yeah, probably not yet, but you can never tell.  Anyway, yeah, let's get off that subject.  Like, fast.  But with the whole grinding thing, you realize that was the week before I met Michael?  I met Michael instead of the other guy from Indiana who brought up that discussion.  Anyway, the real reason I came on here to post was because guess who got married tonight?  Yup, Megan.  Guess who wasn't invited.  My family!!!  w00t.  Yeah, so slightly...pissed, shall we say?  Yeah, not too happy over here.

      How did we get on masturbation again?  I would presume people would do it alone, but some people with loose morals would prolly have some type of reason to not do it alone, instead of doing something else with someone. That's just my guess.

      Man, it was really weird when I read Linds's post first and say the word "masturbate". And then I scrolled down.  KABLAAAM, went life. And then some little guy came along and pissed on the shattered remenants of that once glistening pyre to the flame of existence. And then there was a gas leak and the shattered remenants were instantaneously ignited.  I haven't read "Such Were The Joys...", so that's not what I meant, but I could see where such a thing could be gathered, in that semi-non sequiter comment 'o mine. That really would be weird, considering what a dumb and random thing that would be. Don't get me wrong, I'm on the top of that dumb and random heap. But there's just some grounds that just don't have a reason to, or need to be crossed, and that there is one of them.  It's true that you might have another person there, but they might not be consenting. And if you keep, you're just fucked up, or you're a rapist. Both. Yes, both.  Aah. The damage has been rendered. Any more contamination and the system will not survive. Sure, the IDs are screaming, " f KILL u EAT c MATE k REPEAT " but the sheltered kid superego is like, " Mother wouldn't like that, now would she? " And I can say that, too. I didn't know what "grinding" was until last year, you know. See this BLog for details!!!111oneone  I need to go dunk my head in a vat of cyanide.

      Don't most people masturbate alone?  I mean, there really wouldn't be a point otherwise.  You've got another person right there...   Wow.  Why am I talking about this?  Time to get Michael on the blog, apparently.  He can't contaminate us anymore after that.

      The only reason that a married-in prince can't become is because he would be over the Queen in authority. When a princess marries in and becomes a Queen, she is still below the King in authority. So it makes since.   Not like the Royals have any power anyways :p

      So, speaking of black circles around your eyes...this won't make much sense unless you've read George Orwell's "Such, Such Were the Joys..." but I'll give it a go.  Yeh, so according to Orwell, black circles around your eyes means you masturbate.  Alone.  I hope that wasn't what you meant, Josh.  It would be weird.    I have to go to an Amy Grant/Vince Gill concert next Friday.  And, btw, Stephanie called last night and wanted to talk to me.  It wasn't too bad, actually.  She talked mostly about Alex and his organs.

Completely changing the subject from Disney characters and Finland, though, I went to a Lyle Lovett concert for those of you who know who he is.  Pretty good, but he didn't do enough of his old stuff.  And Francine wasn't there.  She's getting old.  Oh, well.  Good concert anyway.  See yall later.  I'm going to bed.

What a place. I haven't been over my Finnish in a while. I think a lot of it has to do with those pure black circles under mine eyes.  And I'm sorry if the last post was too caustic, Abby. I really wasn't arguing to make a good or valid point, or to make a point. As always, there is lots of talk and not much thinking, as BLogs will do. But I'm sorry if I sounded bitterish. At least that's what I thought. Then again, I am an EMO kid.  And thus: how I get into trouble for running my mouth.

      Ouch, that was a deep wound.  Well I won't argue the royalty bit, since I don't know much about it past the deal with Elizabeth II and her dude (obviously).  Yes, Maid Marion is mostly human; I was arguing in her defense on that one, and yours for that matter. And, wasn't Maid Marion was already a princess before she married Sir Hood? Probly just a slip-up.  And as to Belle and the technicality of being a princess, I did say: "I guess you could say she's one since Beast is a prince-thing if I recall, and that would make her a princess, marrying as such."  So, not a generalized justification, but it is a small justificiation nonetheless.  And again, here we are arguing about Disney characters. Hm.

      Well, if you want to get really technical.  Here come the random facts.  In Britain, a "commoner woman" can marry a prince and become a princess.  (Ex: Princess Diana.  A school teacher marries the prince, becomes princess.)  Then, when the King andQueen dies, and the prince becomes King, the princess (his wife) becomes Queen.  BUT, if a "common man" marries the princess, he will become prince.  Here's the fun part for all the girls.  When the princess becomes Queen, the prince (her husband) can't become King.  Its against British law.  How cool is that?  Maid Marion wears a dress and stands upright and plays badmitton, isn't that mostly human?  If Belle isn't technically a princess, then neither is Cinderella.  Or Maid Marion.  We're talking after marriage.    Wow Josh.  I'm sorry, I just really shot you down in that post.

      *bow*  Altho Maid Marion doesn't really stick to the whole "human" deal since she's a fox in the movie. So..."nine bipedal/almost human princesses".   Hell, it doesn't matter. That's nine, and right now, I'm going to shut up.  ... .

      Well technically animals can't marry. Also, even if a princess does marry a king, she's still a princess, at least by Britain's monarchial standards. And there's plenty of perfectly human ones so Nala isn't even necessary.   Black Cauldron girl was...dammit. No, not "dammit". The guy's name was Taran. Um...the girl's was Eilonwy. I have all of the Prydain Chronicles to back me up on that one, s'don'go thur. It's sad about that movie...I read that it was a disasterpiece in the box office even tho there was some animation innovation with that movie that made it ultra-mega-spiff-lookin'.  And let's not forget....Ariel! That's nine. Jasmine, how about?!? Since Belle really isn't a princess, she gets lumped in with then tho. I guess you could say she's one since Beast is a prince-thing if I recall, and that would make her a princess, marrying as such.   So that's like a billion. Woohoo!  And no hate crimes against the queer that mopped up the rest of the Disney princesses, now.

Belle (Beauty in the Beast) 5.  Pocohontas  6.  Maiden Marion (Robin Hood) 7.  Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)  Umm... Abby, help me out here.  Rosie, we're coming up with 9 Disney Princesses in the classic (when we were kids) animated Disney movies.  And according to Abby, they have to be human, because I tried to get away with Nala.

      To break the silence (and because it's so funny) here's a really great joke that Scott will probably hate me for.  >A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he  could hardly speak.  >After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.  >The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about  getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka  next to the water glass.  >If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."  >So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the  beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a  drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.  >Upon his return to his office after mass, he found  the following note on the door:  >1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.  >2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.  >3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.  >4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.  >5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.  >6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.  >7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred  to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook.  >8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out  of him.  >9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off  his donkey,don't say he was stoned off his ass.  >10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."  >11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he  said, "Take this and eat it for it is my body." He did  not say "Eat me"  >12. The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the  Cherry,"  >13. The recommended grace before a meal is not:  Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God.  >14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest  at St. Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.  Taffy's.

Meaning the blog is back in action and this is the official announcement as to my addiction to the internet.  I've been home approximately ten minutes.  Translated: long enough to put my suitcases in my room.    But I'm hungry, probably shouldn't be, we ate SO MUCH!!!  (Including Josh!!!)  so I'll go have a nice rabbit food now.  Lettuce, not the pellets.  Ok, yeah, I need sleep, and someone give me the answers to those stupid Beloved symbolism quotes.  *Sigh*  Still so much to do, and tomorrow is MONDAY.  Stupid mondays.  Stupid Ms. Calhoun.  Stupid Beloved.    So much for the euphoric Biltmore feeling.

But yeh, let's not to back to the death of all things good and sacred if we can help it. And anyway, the operative word is "deleted", meaning "no longer able to be retrieved".  Booyah. And Chingy rox to the fourth my sox to the fifth, just to say that, not for any real reason.  And Linds...kudos, perro. I'm waiting for you to call back right now, and it's been about fifteen minutes and I wanna know right now, not tomorrow so I'm absotoutleloutely nucking futs waiting for the blasted phone to ring. Bleargh. I don't know how you would pronounce that, I just said it because I'm making filler sentences. I figure at some point here, karma is going to interfere with this post, and I'll type some key word and the phone will ring....yeah, the phone was supposed to ring when I typed that, but it didn't.   RAUGH, I HATE waiting for stuff, almost as much as losing and people being assholes other than myself.   Tick tick tick tick. Bleargh, again. NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW. I want to know, NOW! Je veux savoir, maintenent! Desidero ora sapere! Deseo ahora saber!   YAY!!! And then it rang, three languages later. And I heard some craaaazzy stuff. It was illin'.  Linds (and Abby will know as well, if she uses some mondo Schnooksums reading skills), I couldn't with my own! I mean, you just don't give the nuclear power plant operator's job to Janitor Jos. I am now going to conquer some Gardetto's and pretend like I'm king of the world for a minute, because that's about what it's going to take to make me believe any of this.   I'm still a firm believer that it all begins with one's self. Sure, you may have set down the fire, but I had to keep it burning. The more I say the more I dig the hole.  Keep in mind this post was a great euphemism; it isn't meant to be understood.  A Happy December Fools' Day to all. Now let's go and sleep it off.

      It's all true, but man...there'll be blatantly sexuality everywhere even if the AF monster is totally destroyed. I'll bet a good majority of the male population (for instance) hasn't seen the catalogue, and we're still damn heathens.

      Oh, he did it!!!  w00t.  Ok, here's an article on something that I've hated for years: the advertisement of Abercrombie clothes.  Finally somebody besides me is seeing this.  Anyway, read and enjoy, and if you don't, don't complain.  In all honesty, when I looked at the catalogue, I was apalled.  This is being merketed toward my little sister.    Abercrombie & Fitch to your kids: Group sex now!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted: November 14, 2003 1:00 a.m. Eastern    2003 WorldNetDaily.com    Forty-five specific portrayals of sexual imagery in the first 120 pages, advice to the readers ... this is how the new Abercrombie & Fitch Quarterly titled "The Christmas Field Guide" begins its new quarterly magazine that is targeted to your 10- to 13-year-olds. The 45 images include overt portrayals of group sex, lots of teen and young adult nudity, men kissing, and teens /young adults frolicking in a river engaging in sexual activity in multiple group settings.   Did I mention that the actual clothing doesn't begin being advertised until page 120?   Abercrombie & Fitch are not new to this game and they are taking a huge bet this Christmas season. The wager is ... you won't care enough to do anything about it.   For the last four years a handful of concerned parents and citizens have been waging a miniature war on the popular teen clothier. Each year, the clothier has made hollow gestures at trying to "reform its act." But these attempts are not only insincere, they are laughable. Laughable  but they are not funny.   Each year, thousands of children across America beg their parents to get them the latest t-shirt, jeans, jacket or underwear from "A&F." (Yes they even market a line of thongs for 8- to 10-year-old girls made to stick up out of the "low cut" jeans they also sell.) Many of these parents, completely unaware of how "A&F" goes about marketing, plunk down thousands of dollars around the holidays ... and Abercrombie & Fitch continues to profit.   This year will be different. Thousands of consumers are being put on alert as to the marketing methods of the clothier, web-log writers are going to be commenting on it, church and para-church groups are organizing protests, and this year we will even advise investors via direct links to popular business Internet sites like CBS Marketwatch as to the marketing methods the company is willing to use.   After all, they do say, "We don't just sell clothes, we promote a lifestyle!" And what kind of "lifestyle"?   Well, in this year's issue in the "sexpertise" column on page 279, a lady presumably qualified to be referred to as a "sexpert" states that kids going to college this year, "shouldn't be looking for someone to marry." Nope, when it comes to sex, kids should be "focused on getting experience." The "sexpert" is also asked about and gives advice concerning the issue of doing "sex for three." She also advises readers to be willing to "go down" on a date at the movies, "just so long as you do not disturb those around you." And, of course, what kind of column would a "sexpertise" column be if it did not address the issue of self-stimulation.   There is also a comparison column for the hormonally driven young men in the "A&F" readership comparing the "fruits" of biting into "fresh apple right off the tree" vs. the "store-bought variety that sit on the shelf wrinkled and bruised from the handling." This column is not comparing fruit at all but the benefits of teenage men sleeping with perky school girls vs. "sexy" older women, even married ones.   So the plan of action?   This year's is multi-fold:     Read this column and forward it to everyone you know.   Dial the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families (toll free) 888-877-7723.   Add your voice to the growing list of parents, teens and citizens who wish to see sexually transmitted disease rates reduced, and less teen pregnancy by signing the letter of protest at Stop A&F.   And by all means spend no money with Abercrombie & Fitch this year. (American Eagle, H&M and a variety of other clothiers provide clothing that is equally fashionable to the style of Abercrombie & Fitch  but without the unnecessary nudity and sexualization of Americans aged 10 to 18.)   In a day in which more parents than ever are concerned about the likelihood of their daughter getting pregnant, their child being sexually active long before they are mature enough to handle the consequences or the rampant spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the "younger than 20" demographic today  it's time to stop Abercrombie & Fitch.   Abercrombie & Fitch is wagering you won't care about what they do, so they've rolled the dice. For me, my money is on the decency of you and the hope you have for the future of your kids.   So ... I'll take that bet!

      So, I was going to make a really long post so that it would be hard for Josh not to post a long post, but then I decided, no, I'm tired.  But before I get done, I just wanted to say that my psych paper is done!!!  w00t.  I'm very proud.  Also, did anyone else get their Youth Leadership Brentwood forms back?  I got in, w00t!! I know that Lumley and Jacob did too. Ok, so I haven't officially read the letter.  None of the rest of it interested me.  I just read the "Congratulations,  welcome to Youth Leadership Brentwood" and let my mom take care of the rest.  This should be fun.  I hope our English project is ok.  *Sigh* Poor English project.  Poor computer...  And I'm feeling much better for Josh and Abby, who I'm sure are wondering.  I think I just needed sugar.  Stupid hypoglycemia.  Oh well.  I got my psych paper done early, and now I'm going to bed, w00t.

      Hah, in that case, I'm going to own at college.  Judging as that my vocabulary has expanded far and beyond the standard impositions place upon more plebian (for nonessence of a more fitting vocabularial choice) minds, I should procure no trouble in engaging my pedagogical endeavours with due vehemence and lack of the irksomeness commonly associated with delving one's mind for a word more befitting of such a "holier than thou" sentence as the very one you are perusing.  And I already know how to get beer, call collect, and get crepe-paper stains out of PJs. College is going to blow. Thank god for the beer to make the monotony die a black death.  Sigh...Purity Iced Tea gives such drawn-out, worthless thoughts to life and consideration.

      So, this is us in a few years:   College by Dave Berry   College is basically a bunch of rooms where you sit for roughly two thousand hours and try to memorize things. The two thousand hours are spread out over four years; you spend the rest of the time sleeping and trying to get dates. Basically, you learn two kinds of things in college:  1. Things you will need to know in later life (two hours). These include how to make collect telephone calls and get beer and crepe-paper stains out of you pajamas.  2. Things you will not need to know in later life (1,998 hours). These are the things you learn in classes whose names end in -ology, -osophy, -istry, -ics, and so on. The idea is, you memorize these things, then write them down in little exam books, then forget them. If you fail to forget them, you become a professor and have to stay in college for the rest of your life.  It's very difficult to forget everything. For example, when I was in college, I had to memorize, don't ask me why, the names of three metaphysical poets other than John Donne. I have managed to forget one of them, but I still remember that the other two were named Vaughan and Crashaw. Sometimes, when I'm trying to remember something important like whether my wife told me to get tuna packed in oil or tuna packed in water, Vaughan and Crashaw just pop up in my mind, right there in the supermarket. It's a terrible waste of brain cells. After you've been in college for a year or so, you're supposed to choose a major, which is the subject you intend to memorize and forget the most things about. Here is a very important piece of advice: be sure to choose a major that does not involve Known Facts and Right Answers. This means you must not major in mathematics, physics, biology, or chemistry, because these subjects involve actual facts. If, for example, you major in mathematics, you're going to wander into class one day and the professor will say: "Define the cosine integer of the quadrant of a rhomboid binary axis, and extrapolate your result to five significant vertices." If you don't come up with exactly the answer the professor has in mind, you fail. The same is true of chemistry: if you write in your exam book that carbon and hydrogen combine to form oak, your professor will flunk you. He wants you to come up with the same answer he and all the other chemists have agreed on. Scientists are extremely snotty about this. So you should major in subjects like English, philosophy, psychology, and sociology-subjects in which nobody really understands what anybody else is talking about, and which involve virtually no actual facts. I attended classes in all these subjects, so I'll give you a quick overview of each:   ENGLISH:  This involves writing papers about long books you have read little snippets of just before class. Here is a tip on how to get good grades on your English papers: Never say anything about a book that anybody with any common sense would say. For example, suppose you are studying Moby-Dick. Anybody with any common sense would say that Moby-Dick is a big white whale, since the characters in the book refer to it as a big white whale roughly eleven thousand times. So in your paper, you say Moby-Dick is actually the Republic of Ireland. Your professor, who is sick to death of reading papers and never liked Moby-Dick anyway, will think you are enormously creative. If you can regularly come up with lunatic interpretations of simple stories, you should major in English.   PHILOSOPHY:  Basically, this involves sitting in a room and deciding there is no such thing as reality and then going to lunch. You should major in philosophy if you plan to take a lot of drugs.   PSYCHOLOGY:  This involves talking about rats and dreams. Psychologists are obsessed with rats and dreams. I once spent an entire semester training a rat to punch little buttons in a certain sequence, then training my roommate to do the same thing. The rat learned much faster. My roommate is now a doctor. If you like rats or dreams, and above all if you dream about rats, you should major in psychology.   SOCIOLOGY:  For sheer lack of intelligibility, sociology is far and away the number one subject. I sat through hundreds of hours of sociology courses, and read gobs of sociology writing, and I never once heard or read a coherent statement. This is because sociologists want to be considered scientists, so they spend most of their time translating simple, obvious observations into scientific-sounding code. If you plan to major in sociology, you'll have to learn to do the same thing. For example, suppose you have observed that children cry when they fall down. You should write: "Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists between groundward tropism and lachrymatory, or 'crying,' behavior forms." If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will get a large government grant.   EDUCATION:  Like sociologists, educators want desperately to believe that they are scientists and that there is something involved in teaching which is esoteric, above and beyond, one person telling a group of people things to memorize. I once sat through a class in educational techniques where the topic of the semesters was The Need For Openness In The Modern Classroom. We memorized the need for students to be free to express themselves in class both verbally and physically without restraint, as we sat in neat rows repeating exactly what the professor, and other educators had agreed we should memorize. Another example: if you want to say at a particular student is lazy and need to have his butt kicked, you must translate as follows: "The paradigm established by the environmental constraints imposed on the student by an autocratic, patriarchal, and thereby outmoded system of values, has created an apathetic mode of response on the part of the student which requires stimuli be applied via a systematic outcome based approach with a goal of enriching the student to alternative multiculturally based, non-violent methods of self actualization"

And it snowed at the beginning of the break, that's a sign of goodness. It's been sunny the last three years on the first day of break if I recall, and then there's a lot of gray and no tangible whiteness.   Tho I know my Western folk ain't looking forward to a White Christmas...that crazy bunch. I'm going there too, so bollocks to the snow, then.  Whatsay about whatever this weekend, Linds?

My grandpa had a clog in a vein in his neck once, and there was some lumpage after they operated...they said not to worry about it unless [insert unnatural non-homeostatic condition here, i.e. unusual fatigue, throbbing pain].

Well, that didn't exactly phase Whitney, so she rummages around on his desk for a while and finds them under a coffee mug and a pencil pouch. Needless to say, I am very much indebted to her.

I figure one o' those will get me an all access pass into the Fat Man's house, whereafter I can have a field day.  The rhinocerous was the desire to have an unusual and large animal. Frankly, I'm more surprised that no one mentioned the fact that I wanted an astronaut. As in, I wanted to keep a human being in an astronaut suit in my room. Eh, I would have thought it was cool when I was a kid, I was maldeveloped.  If only that was all.  Goodbye to all, I'm going to fraggin' AZ.

      Keilei just had to be flown to Birmingham.  She's having tremors in the whole right side of her body, probably because the umbilical cord was tied around her neck. Blake, his dad, and my Uncke Keith (Megan's dad) went to Birmingham with her because Megan is still recovering from surgery.  We should know by Friday what is wrong.

Even if they were shit-faced they wouldn't be able to resist the wonder of this really cool stuff they were...well...being forced to see, I guess. It's like regular school with more, less "stuck out like a sore thumb" psychology. I would be a sneaky little monkey about being Freudian.  Hmm...so between this, and the Biltmore, I'd say I'm going to need that recording contract pretty soon. It's going to be tight, but I think I can manage.

      Hey, everybody.  We're back.  I feel like crap.  I've got a cold or something, and my eye is doing something funky.  I think I scratched my cornea.  Anyway, I was feeling decent last night and Rob came over.  That was fun.  We watched part of Spiderman, part of Little Nicky, and all of Iron Chef.  Not that we really paid attention or anythingbecause we kept talking about the most random stuff...  Anyway, nobody except Abby really cared about that, so I'm going to go now.

      Wow, I'm insanely tired, but I just had so much fun I had to post.  We went over to Las Palmas (Abby, you KNOW it's your favorite restaurant!) with the Harmons, and Holly had her boyfriend, Matt with her, so Rob came (I ate in front of him!!  We're really getting somehwere.)  Then we (minus Matt) went to the Harmons to watch the game which we lost.  Oh well.  We had fun anyway.  Rob really blends well with the family and god-family.  He was really sweet tonight even though everyone was acting like their normal, embarrassing selves.  I don't know, I guess I didn't expect it to go so well or something.  This might actually turn out to be something.  We might be like a "Josh and Abby, Jr."  That would be so cute.  He actually mentioned that the other day on the way to the pep rally, which was kinda weird, but I can see where he's coming from.  I think we've gotten through the major "hurdles" now, thank God.  This might work.  Wow.  Who would've ever thought.    Wow, you have now just read my innermost thoughts.  Congratulations.  That's what happens when I'm this tired.  I actually fell asleep on his shoulder during the last four minutes of the game.  When I woke up, he was like "Are you INSANE???  That was the entire game right there."  Yeah, like I cared.  I'd just spent like 30 minutes asleep on his shoulder.  OK, I'm going to bed now before I give you intimate details about the rest of my life.  Oh, and Keilei came home last Monday.  I think I forgot to mention that on here.  Maybe I didn't, but it's almost midnight.  And Abby (nobody else bother reading this; it won't make sense):  No rule of three.  Sorry.

And everyone needs to go and get Linkin Park Live in Texas. I have never heard a human being scream as Chester Bennington did on  A Place For My Head .

      Hey hey HEY! What about the female species? I was highly offended by that "mister" just now, "miss"!, that's discrimination. So. This is a post. I would like to talk about Glen. Glen is actually pretty cool. He can make a mean prime rib. He has lots of money and makes really annoying jokes when it comes to money or the lack or overabundance thereof of said substance. He has a really annoying laugh and uses it like a nine-year old. Like, he's watching VH1, and someone just made a joke about Jenna Jameson being a dirty whore (porn star, but I hope you all knew that), and he laughed his ASS off. He squeals better than I do. He drives a Concord LXI and is saving up to buy a Mercedes SLX, convertible, no less, in cash. I have seen him no less than eight times in the last twenty days, topping any records of actually glimpsing the guy by a long shot...try: ever. He's a likable dude, tho. I think they're seriously planning on getting married. Which isn't any problem, I just wish they would come the hell out and say it.  So there's a post, by dammit. Woo! Let's all talk about Glen and ask questions so that I can really figure out if I hate him or if I just want his money!  Or we could talk about "mirror flirting" for a while...see   ANTIPHILANTHROPHY   for details. I was almost going to get on line, then I got tired. Rob better improve or he might find himself poised below the long end of my booted leg. Ja, ja, he's a sugardaddy, but I think he can do better. A "hi" would be mighty, mighty impressive at this point. I say make him really embarrassed, and then tell him you're doing it intentionally until he pays more attention, that'll confuse him and make him clean up at the same time. I'm serious, you could be direct as hell aboot telling him your intentions and he'll be really confused as to why you're telling him, but he'll still try to improve.   But that requires a little not-Lindsey work, so we're not counting aboot that one, eh. I guess it's the boot.  Heh heh heh.

      Dudes, Addagios are hardcore on the guitar. Just a sidenote or whatever from one school of music to another. And fugue = incredible if you get the right man to play it. I listened to Ynigwie (ING-vay, long "a") Malmsteen play some, it changed my life.   And do note that most classical pianists were heavy into guitar sometimes, surprisingly enough. Bach did quite a bit if I remember correctly, I have the music to a song of his in my room, and it's really rockin' it hardcore when played correctly.

      Yeah, I'm doing a Chopin and another guy I don't remember.  It's an Adaggio, so it's pretty, but they're both really short and easy, so I didn't really even mention them.  I'll post the other guy's name when I feel like looking it up.

      Fugues are hard in general. Grace did a Bach fugue and it was like ok....do that in slow motion. It sounds really hard but I didn't like it mainly because she did one with alot of clashing cords...don't like a whole piece of those. The Beethovan Sonata, those are fun! The dynamics are like wow I love those. Ok Chopin, prolly because it's like Kay's and LiLi's fav composer. Mozart...I couldn't care less for. I mean he's great but I think overload int he beginning. Also the fact that the variation and the polonaise sound similar it's really not...what I want in audition set. Anyway enough piano. Byebye

      I'm starting a Bach fugue and a Beethoven sonata today.  I'm really looking foward to doing them.  Patsy says they're insanely hard, but it's about time.  She had me on easy stuff all last semester.    Chopin's not bad.  Just wait until you finish, then you'll really love it.  You've done more Chopin than I have most likely, so you know all about that.

      not extremely low. Mine's somewhere around there. can you give me some of that desire for piano? I just played around 1.5 hours and I'm so tired. Also because it's liek 10.35. anyway the point is I'm doing a Mozart Variation and a CHopin Polonaise and they're getting on my nerves. I just started them in Jan. around 10 days and I'ma bout to kill this variation...it's SO dull!!

      Is it possible to be addicted to playing the piano?  It seems to be the only thing I want to do lately.  That usually only happens when I extremely happy or really depressed (as in depressed, not sad) and I'm really not either right now.  I mean, I'm happiER, but not HAPPY exactly.  I've had too many fights with Mamita to actually be HAPPY.  But I'm definitely not even close to a little bit sad.  Or mad.  Or whatever.  I just want to play the freaking piano.  ALL the time.  Literally, I've been on it almost five hours and then I come in here and work on homework or post on the blog or eat when my arms get to tired to hold their own weight.  I have really low blood pressure.  110/70.  Isn't that weird?  Rosie should understand that one.

      " nescio quod " (I don't know what in Latin), but I think we should do the DI thing and I know I could go.    What happened at "Woompty House"? or is it one of those stories that no one wants to know?  And now it's a trilogue, which sounds a lot like trilogy in some messed up fashion

      Rock n' roll man.  Aye man, I'd like to know about that thing on Saturday, too. I'm supposed to go jam it old-school avec Pariah.  " Je ne sais quoi ," means something to the effect of "I don't know what"...that's the phrase in quotes right there. Remember in Austin Powers 2 when Dr. Evil was discussing his evil plan in the Starbucks tower and he said, "What the French call a certain...I don't know what," he was actually referring to that phrase. But mostly people laughed because it made him look stupid and ignorant, and we all love a stupid and ignorant person.   Weehee!

We just have to pass one for my stomach to start doing flips.  Are we doing the DI thing on Saturday or not?  I would post this on the DI blog, except the whole no access thing kinda sucks.  Je ne sais quias, all.  I don't know if I spelled that right, and I know it doesn't mean what I want it to, but it's the only French phrase I know, and since Josh and Abby use French all the time, I thought I would too.  And now we're a dialogue.  w00t.  And yes, you diid spell monologue right.

      Good day again, friends.   Well, hmm....it's sort of becoming a monologue (sp?, fer crying) in here. But that's ok because one day, someone's going to get back on, and read these posts and wonder:  what  was he smoking, again, pray tell?   So, I think it should be said that I wish everyone a good first day back to Hell tomorrow.  I embraced the joys of Waffle House at my mom's request today, and now I'm paying Yazoo, Mississippi for it. I think my stomach has developed its own culture and diverse ways of life with all the grease I took in today. I just thought I would share since one of the cultures growled a "may it do ya fine" to all the BLoggies just now.  Bon chance until latr, companions.

      Eh, it's more fun with people anyway!  Naw, the PETA can go suck an egg. We decided against that one anyway, I think, just cuz it's sounds like a grindcore name, and for those of you that don't know, grindcore sort of sucks.  I'm about to try the new tea, I've waited all day. I really don't know about powder-based green tea, but hell, anything's worth a shot, as long as you don't bleed very badly thereafter.  Pariah is an Indian word coming from the caste system and whatnot; it means something to the effect of "ruffage". Pretty much, it's the lowest rung of the ladder in society, you're crap, you're nobody, you're worse than a slave, you nothing more than a breathing sack of organic compounds. The M-W definition is: 1 : a member of a low caste of southern India 2 : outcast, altho we've found that it's a much stronger word in context. It comes from Tamil, and the translation is "drummer," which makes NO sense. Or maybe it does. Now we see why everyone hates the drummers in bands so much?  That colon means you've been being hypnotized by Kelly too much. Take the day off tomorrow. Stupid Socratic seminar. How about those of us who don't like to be useful in class, or fear saying something stupid so they hardly say anything when they can help it? Stupid Kelly, stupid. The lady is the most even-tempered and agreeable person, but honestly, someone needs to drag her ambitions of being a good teacher to pasture and have them shot. Aie.  Tea time! Have a good day off tomorrow, dudes. Yes, you heard me. Well, some of us (sorry Abby!), perhaps (never give up the hope, etc.). I'm going to do the Snow Dance right now, and damned if it isn't going to be painful. Arrivederci.

      Ok, here's a thought: what's a Pariah?  (What does that colon symbolize to you?)  Let's not do Moose Carcass.  PETA might get after you and you'd have to hook a disclaimer.  So the whole name would be more like "Moose Carcass (disclaimer: no animals were hurt in the writing or performing of this music)" and that's just a really long name.  Good luck with the new tea.  Sorry for interrupting the monologue.  I know you were having a lot of fun being the center of attention and all.

      Monologue, awesome. No sarcasm, I'm serious! It's really weird not having people post, so to a poster (myself at present) in such a situation, it's rather interesting. Yes, it's a complicated feeling.  So...hm...we had a band practice on Snow Day...dudes....we totally owned everything within at least a three mile radius, and the ownage tremors could be felt several counties over. Presently, and because another band is called Pariah ( urlLink click here and throw rocks at them! ) already, we've changed our name...to what, is not certain. It could be Daniel Krikorian's Suicide Death Machine, it could be Moose Carcass, it could be Cousin It, and it could be Trapeze Act. We don't really know as of yet. All we do know is: we BRING the  death  to the death metal. Excitement overflows.  Hoo! I'm really wired I believe. Wyler's just put out some green tea with peach flavour and I'm sort of anxious to try it, so I think I'm going to, but before this I was having Purity tea, which is the BEST of the non-flavoured teas, and caffeine+me=REALLY PERSONABLE! But that tends to get old. So...I wish you all the best until next time.

Oh, and I learned how to peel an apple correctly.  Apparently I've been doing it wrong all along so my mommy had to teach me to do it right.  It takes me about 5 minutes my way.  It took me 18 her way.  But I got to eat it, so it's all good.  With peanut butter too, yum.  What the hell am I smoking?  I just went back and read what I just wrote.  Wow.

My mom and Glen gave me two when I got my car, and I was like..."Uh...yeah, great," when I got the second one. And kind of the same reaction on the first one, to be honest.  Quilts are nice! Well, I enjoy them.  And really, females seem to have better taste in clothing than men, so if you all want to buy the ties and socks....that's great. But no pink. NUH-UNH, NO. Pinks socks are fine cuz no one's  really  going to see them. But that's only if there isn't another color. And really, who's going to say no to a bathrobe? They're awesome. O no, let's wear jockey shorts and be real men. Real men=the biggest damn babies you've ever seen, they'll be in a bathrobe faster than you can think a short phrase.  But remote controls are very cool, and replacements...ahhh.   Alcohol is alcohol. A real man would drink whatever the hell is there. And no, this does NOT make real men alcoholics...well at least that much.  Hahaha. No, no rope. Get us a rope making KIT, we would go apeshit (rhyme) over it (rhyme again, both of those were really unintentional, but I had to go back after typing them and point this out). It instills a certain sense of pride, procuring the grass, weaving the grass, pulling the grass, using the grass. And really, wheelbarrows are for gardeners. And no real man is a gardener. Absolutely no logical fallacies on that last statement, a'tall. Stepladders just don't reek of that thrill of danger so much, and so now you all know why.  Hey look at me! I'm bored!!!!

      This is sure to brighten someone's day.  Lord knows we all need it.     Gift Buying Rules for Men.  Rule #1:  When in doubt - buy him a cordless drill. It does not matter if he  already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain.  As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.   Rule #2:  If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word  ratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words. "Hey  George, can I borrow your ratchet?" "OK. By-the-way, are you through  with my 3/8-inch socket yet?" Again, no one knows why.   Rule #3:  If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car, a 99-cent  ice scraper, a small bottle of de-icer or something to hang from his  rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.   Rule #4:  Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes.  Once I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he  wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.   Rule #5:  You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn  out. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the  little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips,  and flips....   Rule #6:  Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in  a cupboard for 23 years. Real men drink whiskey or beer.   Rule #7:  Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or  deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.   Rule #8:  Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple  of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. "Socks. Shorts.  Cups. Saucers. Door. Lock. Sink." You get the idea. No one knows why.   Rule #9:  Never buy a man anything that says "some assembly required" on the box.  It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.   Rule #10:  Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, ParrLumber,  Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire.(NAPA Auto  Parts and Sear's Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It  doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. "From NAPA Auto, eh? Must  be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane?  Wow! Thanks.")   Rule #11:  Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue.  Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the  gas line leaks. "Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?"   Rule #12:  Tickets to a Seahawks game are a smart gift. However, he will not  appreciate tickets to "A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts." Everyone  knows why.   Rule #13:  Men love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you  don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a  label maker.   Rule #14:  It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension  ladder. Never buy a real man a stepladder. It must be an extension  ladder. No one knows why.   Rule #15:  Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least  the Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8" manila  rope. No one knows why.

      I think I have to stick up for us americans here.  This is (could be, who knows) an actual letter sent to a man named Ryan  DeVries by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, State of  Michigan.   Wait till you read this guy's response!   SUBJECT: DEQ File No.97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County Dear  Mr.  DeVries:   It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that  there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of  property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor  who did the following unauthorized activity:   Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream  of Spring Pond.   A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A  review of the department's files shows that no permits have been issued.  Therefore, the department has determined that this activity is in violation  of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and  Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being  sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compile Laws, annotated.   The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially  failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and flooding at downstream  locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and  cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist  all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow  condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream  channel.   All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 2002.   Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a  follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.  Failure to comply  with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result  in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate  and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.   Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.   Sincerely, David L.  Price, District Representative Land and Water Management  Division ___________________________________________________   This is the actual response sent back:   Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County.   Dear Mr.  Price,   Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson,  Michigan.  A couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of  constructing and maintaining two wood "debris" dams across the outlet stream  of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their  dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their  skillful use of nature building materials "debris." I would like to challenge  your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any  place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no way you could  ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity,  their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.   As to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first  fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity.  My first dam question to you is:   (1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers?  or, (2)  do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam  request?   If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the  Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other  applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued.  Perhaps we will see if  there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the  Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the PublicActs  of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws,  annotated.   I have several concerns.  My first concern is - aren't the beavers entitled  to legal representation?  The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute  and are unable to pay for said representation- so the State will have to  provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department's dam concern that either one  or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing flooding is  proof that this is a natural ccurrence, which the Department is required to  protect.   In other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than  harass them and call their dam names.  If you want the stream "restored"to a  dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers, but if you are going to  arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter;  they being unable to read English.   In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their  unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water  flows downstream.  They have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy  Spring Pond.  If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental  Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural resources  (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams.).   So, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred  for more elevated enforcement action right now.  Why wait until 1/31/2002?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no  way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.   In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention to a real  environmental quality (health) problem in the area.  It is the bears!  Bears  are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be  persecuting the defecating bears and leave the beavers alone.  If you are  going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step!  (The bears are not  careful where they dump!)   Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you  on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office.   Very truly yours, Ryan DeVries

      Here's something sure to liven your day.    AN ANGRY LETTER FROM ENGLAND Actual British complaint letter. The piece  suggests two things    1) Americans and Canadians are not the only ones who get poor service from  their ISP, cable and/or alarm companies. (NTL is a cable operator in  Britain).    2) The Brits probably write the world's best letters of complaint.    ====================================    Dear Cretins    I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for your  four-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, telephone, and alarm  monitoring.    During this three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service  which I had not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and  stupidity of monolithic proportions. Please allow me to provide specific  details, so that you can either pursue your professional prerogative and  seek to rectify these difficulties -- or more likely (I suspect) so that  you can have some entertaining reading material as you while away the  working day smoking B&H and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your  office.    My initial installation was cancelled without warning, resulting in my  spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your  technician to arrive. When he did not arrive, I spent a further 57 minutes  listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more annoying  Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful website. HOW?    I alleviated the boredom by playing with my testicles for a few minutes --  an activity at which YOU are no doubt both familiar and highly adept. The  rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later, although  the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools -- such as a  drill-bit and his cerebrum. Two weeks later, my cable modem had still not  arrived. After 15 telephone calls over four weeks my modem arrived, six  weeks after I had requested it -- and begun to pay for it. I estimate your  internet server's downtime is roughly 35% -- the hours between about 6 pm  and midnight, Monday through Friday and most of the weekend. I am still  waiting for my telephone connection.    I have made nine calls on my mobile to your no-help line and have been  unhelpfully transferred to a variety of disinterested individuals who are,  it seems, also highly skilled bollock jugglers. I have been informed that  a telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that I will  be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is  available (and then been cut off); that I will be transferred to someone  (and then been redirected to an answering machine informing me that your  office is closed); that I will be transferred to someone and then been  redirected to the irritating Scottish robot woman. And several other  variations on this theme.    Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a  thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore and also another one of  those crucially important testicle moments to attend to. Frankly I don't  care. It's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustrations in  print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me,  therefore, if I continue.    I thought British Telecom was crap; that they had attained the holy  piss-pot of god-awful customer relations; and that no one, anywhere, ever,  could be more disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to  delivering service to their customers. That's why I chose NT and because,  well, there isn't anyone else is there?    How surprised I therefore was when I discovered to my considerable  dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless shower of bastards you  truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of distended rectum, incompetents  of the highest order. BT -- wankers though they are -- shine like  brilliant beacons of success in the filthy mire of your seemingly  limitless inadequacy.    Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and foolhardy quest  to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that you cease any  potential future attempts to extort payment from me for the services which  you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to deliver. Any such  activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and disbelief and will  quickly be replaced by derision and even perhaps bemused rage.    I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my cat's  litter tray, as an _expression of my utter and complete contempt for both  you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not become  desiccated during transit -- they were satisfyingly moist at the time of  posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did not  experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them the  very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL and its worthless employees.    Have a nice day. May it be the last in your miserable short lives, you  irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twits.              May you rot in Hell, Robert Stokes

      Heh, well as long as the smoke isn't too carcinogenic, I suppose it's all good. I still wanna see the penguin.  The Osbournes is perhaps the most repetetive, yet neverendingly hilarious show, that has been created in a long while. It's one of those shows that make you appreciate the English and the diversity of curses one can procure...it's astounding.  Umm well...I figure, the peel comes off, the job is done, but that's just me. But then again, I use the "procure-wash-indulge" method of eating apples, so I can't talk.   Pllaal. Does anyone know what that means? I was thinking of what to type next and I typed that, as you see it right now. Pray for my sanity, or insanity, depending on your viewpoint. And also notice that I used the word "procure" twice in this post, so I suppose that is the word of the day.  Hope everyone is having a good weekend. And have fun with coffee Linds.

      thought the psych students would like this.  Essay by Freud on Seuss                  a book review by Josh LeBeau   (copied from the Koala, UCSD's humour newspaper, which has no  copyright notices in it anywhere)   The Cat in the Hat is a hard-hitting novel of prose and poetry  in which the author re-examines the dynamic rhyming schemes and  bold imagery of some of his earlier works, most notably _Green  Eggs and Ham_, _If I Ran the Zoo_, and _Why Can't I Shower With  Mommy?_  In this novel, Theodore Geisel, writing under the  pseudonym Dr. Seuss, pays homage to the great Dr. Sigmund Freud  in a nightmarish fantasy of a renegade feline helping two young  children understand their own frustrated sexuality.   The story opens with two youngsters, a brother and a sister,  abandoned by their mother, staring mournfully through the  window of their single-family dwelling.  In the foreground, a  large tree/phallic symbol dances wildly in the wind, taunting  the children and encouraging them to succumb to the sexual  yearnings they undoubtedly feel for each other.  Even to the  most unlearned reader, the blatant references to the  incestuous relationship the two share set the tone for Seuss'  probing examination of the satisfaction of primitive needs.  The Cat proceeds to charm the wary youths into engaging in  what he so innocently refers to as "tricks."  At this point,  the fish, an obvious Christ figure who represents the  prevailing Christian morality, attempts to warn the children,  and thus, in effect, warns all of humanity of the dangers  associated with the unleashing of the primal urges.  In  response to this, the cat proceeds to balance the aquatic  naysayer on the end of his umbrella, essentially saying,  "Down with morality; down with God!"   After poohpoohing the righteous rantings of the waterlogged  Christ figure, the Cat begins to juggle several icons of  Western culture, most notably two books, representing the Old  and New Testaments, and a saucer of lactal fluid, an ironic  reference to maternal loss the two children experienced when  their mother abandoned them "for the afternoon."  Our heroic  Id adds to this bold gesture a rake and a toy man, and thus  completes the Oedipal triangle.   Later in the novel, Seuss introduces the proverbial Pandora's  box, a large red crate out of which the Id releases Thing One,  or Freud's concept of Ego, the division of the psyche that  serves as the conscious mediator between the person and  reality, and Thing Two, the Superego which functions to reward  and punish through a system of moral attitudes, conscience,  and guilt.  Referring to this box, the Cat says, "Now look at  this trick.  Take a look!"  In this, Dr. Seuss uses the  children as a brilliant metaphor for the reader, and asks the  reader to re-examine his own inner self.   The children, unable to control the Id, Ego, and Superego  allow these creatures to run free and mess up the house, or  more symbolically, control their lives.  This rampage  continues until the fish, or Christ symbol, warns that the  mother is returning to reinstate the Oedipal triangle that  existed before her abandonment of the children.  At this  point, Seuss introduces a many-armed cleaning device which  represents the psychoanalytic couch, which proceeds to put  the two youngsters' lives back in order.   With powerful simplicity, clarity, and drama, Seuss reduces  Freud's concepts on the dynamics of the human psyche to an  easily understood gesture.  Mr. Seuss' poetry and choice of  words is equally impressive and serves as a splendid  counterpart to his bold symbolism.  In all, his writing style  is quick and fluid, making _The Cat in the Hat_ impossible to  put down.  While this novel is 61 pages in length, and one  can read it in five minutes or less, it is not until after  multiple readings that the genius of this modern day master  becomes apparent.

      I have a new... second cousin, I think is what he would be to me.  He's my cousin's baby.  Anyway, Jacob Wayne was born this morning at 7:45.  I'm really really happy.  And the best news of all?  He's LEGITIMATE!!!  It's the first legitimate baby we've had in 12 years.  The last one was Whitney.  Everyone else (there have been 9 since her) were either adopted or were illegitimate.  How redneck is that for you? Oh well, I'm excited, and he was named for my daddy (Wayne is my daddy's middle name too), so as to continue with tradition (every second male child in the family is named after my daddy.)  Anyway, I gotta go.  I'll tell you more later.

      Oops, completely forgot to remind yall I was going to be in Florida.  I was in Flordia, there is your post-vacation reminder.  Anyway, I came home immensely disappointed today.  We heard on the news all weekend that it snowed like 8 inches up here and we get back and there is not ONE FREAKIN' FLAKE!!!  And I was really excited about getting out of school, too.  *sigh* Ah, well.  Hope we didn't have homework.  That could be bad.  Oh, and big ol' W00T cause Abby called me and we talked for like an hour.  She is off phone and computer restrictions so we have the communication up and rolling.  Life is (semi) good again.  I was really going through some major Abby-withdrawals.  But it seems we have come through it okay.  Maybe I can actually SEE her sometime within the next week. That would be good.  I missed her.

      Hell, man. Well if it's any consolation, I think coming might have been more of a brain frap. Granted all the tests got cancelled because of the snow (except for Riley, but you don't have him of course, and he's  gay ). 50 point essay in Kelly among other things; it's about e.e. cummings, so all you really have to say is, "The guy's fucking cracked," and that should about do it. I can't believe she almost sent you to school and bitched about the whole speed thing. Well, yeah actually, I can believe it ("baseboard dust", remember?), but I think it's horseshit. And it's your car so bygod, if you want to bust the living shit out of it, they should say "Go right ahead dear," or "How heavy do you want the sledge to be?"   Did you get a "thx!!!11" for picking her up? You could have just...not, I'd have loved to see that. And I'm sorry about Christy. I think your mom just gave the orders out of desperation so man, I hope you didn't follow through. But it's alright, because there's a good weekend or so to recover, and me and Will are planning on having mental health weeks come next, and man, we'd be happy if you joined us.   Eh, I hope you have a good weekend man, to make up for the shoddy-suck day.

      Disclaimer:  This is just a long rant about my crappy day.  You don't have to read it.    Yeah, so for those of you who didn't notice, I wasn't at school today.  Yesterday was a really bad day and quite frankly this morning wasn't much better.  After I got the phone call saying that we weren't going to Gatlinburg, Mom suggested that we go to the mall, which I was kind of hesitant about because we always stay there forever and I had a lot of homework and studying to do, but she said it would do me good to get out of the house, so we went to the mall.  Ok, so that was fun and all, but we didn't get back home until 8:30.  Now I have about 4 hours to completely learn a chapter in math (thank God for Becca) and do all the homework for a month in there, study for a Psych test, an AP US History Quiz, and a Spanish quiz, and do Spanish and Anatomy homework, none of which I knew anything about.  Realizing this, I promptly have a panic attack and make myself rather sick.  After I calm down a bit, I call Becca and she stays here until past midnight helping me with my math stuff.  Then I stayed up until around 3 to try and finish my math homework, but I'm quite unsuccessful.  Mom finally comes and makes me go to bed, and then wakes me up this morning at 6:00 or so and I was like "Can I take a mental health day?" which I've never done before, and she was quite set against the idea, but she said to call my daddy, which was a mistake on her part, because I'm Daddy's favorite.  After a couple of tears and me explaining the situation with a few "Daddy, I love you"s thrown in there for good measure, Daddy takes my side and argued with mom for me.  Needless to say, he won, since I wasn't there today.  So mom goes to take Whitney to school and after about 30 minutes she isn't home and I'm kind of getting worried when the phone rings.  It's mom.  She's got a flat tire and I have to go pick her up.  All the way home, I'm going about 5 under the speed limit and she's like "Lindsey, watch your speed.  Lindsey, I'm going to take the car keys away from you.  Lindsey, I thought you were going to bottom out on that speed bump" (I was going about 7 mph) which wasn't annoying at all.  So we get home, and mom starts her Bible study for the day and gets sick.  So I have to take care of her.  Still haven't gotten much done.  I sit down and eat a little bit and get to work.  After about 3 hours, I'm finally done with math.  Another 2 hours and I'm done with everything else.  So I come up for lunch and see mom crying and asked her what was wrong.  Apparently a close friend of the family's(Christy Stickney, the one with leukemia, who I've asked yall to pray for quite a bit) cancer has spread to her brain and the doctors are giving her about two weeks to live.  Then mom left for Ruthanne's house with commands for me to clean up the entire house even though Lori came two days ago.  *sigh*  Not a good day.  I don't think it's done much for my mental health.

      Man, that is straight-up bringing the gay, I am sorry man. This is going to sound like a really dumb question, but I'm a bit confused so I'll ask...was that one for Forensics? And if so, do you just postpone it til some other time? But I bet it's not for the team or whatever, but I wondered.  Dudes, not to sunshine on the funeral or anything, but the most random thing happened today, some lady calls and informs me that I'm the "Mayor of Smashville" at the Preds game this Saturday...it was really random. She called and said I put my name in a drawing at some Sofa Connection somewhere and that I got tagged. The interesting part is that the last time I was at a Sofa Connection, I was nine years old. So, today's lesson, kids: the wait is well worth it, especially if it involves a zamboni ride (which it does!!!!111oneoneoneeleveneleven).  Alright sorry, I'm done.

Sounds more like psychodynamic tho, and the things really didn't do anything besides tear shit up...then again, what else are they supposed to represent? Oh, I know, having sex with your mother and killing your father, because after all, that's all it boils down to anyway. There, the Freudian/Jungian analysis is complete.  I bet Freud got really tickled every time he used the word " anal ytical".

And for my dad's friend in General Services, he died of pneumonia after a huge and essentially lifelong immuno-deficiency battle the other day. Again, a *sigh* should here be input...please keep the families in your prayers.  On a lighter note: Kitties! Butterflies! Puffy white clouds! Waltzes in the springtime! Warm summer nights! Snuggling up with a huge glass of hot chocolate and a blanket and watching Lifetime! Woodstock (old, peaceful hippy Woodstock)! Hugs and kisses! Blah blah blah.

      Right you are there Josh.  I'm feeling kind of what Whitney likes to call "Iggy."  My mom just left, and I'm really glad because I have over a week to just relax now.  On the other hand, I feel guilty that I wanted her to leave and I'm concerned about the whole safety issue.  Because, you know, I could really protect them or whatever if I was there.  Anyway... bad part, though, is that my parents hired a freaking baby-sitter.  She was writing out what I needed to do while she was gone and what Katie (the baby-sitter) was supposed to do, and looked at it and goes "Wow, this is kind of pointless.  I'm paying her to sleep.  You're doing everything else."  I was like 'hey, good job, mom.  only took you a month and a half to figure that one out.'  So she almost called to cancel, but then was like "I think it's illegal to leave someone under 18 in charge of another minor overnight."  So the baby-sitter still stands.  But she also said I was in charge.  Whatever.  Anyway, I gotta go get dressed.  I'm going to build-a-bear.  Why am I so excited over that?  That's kind of sad...  Oh well.

      Now that is truly the feminist movement at its best.  I don't even remember kicking that little boy- apparently I repressed that memory.  I Just found out about it about a year ago.  Josh, don't hate prom, that's not nice. Abby and I will help out if you need us to.  And you call Rob and Gossett.  I don't want to tell my own boyfriend how much he's going to be spending on me, and Gossett is really mad at me right now.  Just call Carabba's right as it opens and get reservations.  The good news about it not taking our reservations is that they won't take anyone else's either, so it's ok.  You never did tell me about the limo...

Damn prom, it's making my ears bleed just thinking about it. But yes, it be time to finish things up. And sorry to break topic, but it was sort of urgent so I had to interject.  Ooh one more thing....there's no reservation making at Carrabba's, you have to call on the day of, they don't take anything in advance.....I hate prom. HATE HATE HATE HATE. Heh, peace all.

      anytime.  So you're saying that if I want to make him stop doing that I shouldn't beat the stuffing out of him, I should duct tape my parents to the nearest wall and be sure they never reward him for being a bum ever again?  YAY!  good, kicking people is perfectly alright, I'm sure the boy deserved it.  I think Walt is just a strange one.  I believe he bit three differnt people in knidergarten, just a little out of the norm.  and thank you, I thought it was quite effective in my use of it.

      YAY!!!  Big post!!!    Anyway, answer to question: Because it has worked before.  Like Coach Hart says, if the behavior has been rewarded before, it will most likely happen again.  Meaning, of course, that every time he goes crying to your mother and she makes you get off so he can get on, she is rewarding the crying, stomping, biting?!? that comes with it.  Answer to poll: I never bit anyone in kindergarten, but I did kick a boy in first grade.  I like the unplugging the monitor idea- Julian does that to me all the time.  It's very annoying and very effective.

      Yes, there is indeed a reason for this topic.  I was on the computer checking my e-mail and blogs and my twelve year old brother came up here and told me to "get off, I have to do homework" ths sounds like a reasonable request; until you realize he had been on the computer for at least three hours already this evening (we had gotten home approximately three and a half hours before this point, and the half hour not accounted for was dinner) and for at least two and a half hours I watched him play games on the computer.  So anyway, he comes up here and demands the computer again because he forgot to do something, at this point it's approximately 6:30, giving him at least two and a half hours before he has to go to bed, plenty of time to get back on the computer after I get off in less than five minutes.  So I tell him he can wait the five or so minutes it takes for me to check my blogs and respond when I think it's necessary.  He then goes berserk, crying, stomping, whining, screaming, temper tantrum, runs to mommy dearest, and demands she make me get off.  She then yells at me for "being a computer hog" Anyone whom knows my mother will find this extremely funny because she spends at least ten hours a day on said machine.  And he proceeds to run up here and stick his tongue out at me and generaly look like he won. At this point I'm to this blog and I decided to start a topic about him.  so he tries to get me off for several more minutes, in which I type the message, go to all games free, play several games of collapse, etc.  I finally decide his frequent kicking, screaming, and biting has become annoying and decide to allow him to do what ever it is he's spitting about.  So he sits down witha smug look on his face to print off whatever it was, then he proceeded to go to Big Cheats or some sort site. This I decided would be an ideal moment to unplug the computer.  I didn't; but I did unplug the monitor and make it look like I unplugged the computer.  He then attempted to kill me in that abmisal fashion in which children think their punches actually hurt, but then I put my foot in his face (not kicked him, just put my foot on his nose) and he decided this wasn't a fight he was going to win, so he stormed off. At which point I plugged the monitor back in and shut the big cheat window and went back to what I was doing.    My question is why does he think he can get away with this?  What exactly is it that makes him believe that he can ever get away with this? and BITING? is this kindergarten?  Oh and I have a poll, I want to see just how special my brother is, How many people remember someone biting another person in kindergarten?  thanks

(This question only applies if they were B-wood cops).  Also, As I Survey the Wonderous Cross is absolutely amazing.  Must commend you on that version.  You would make wesley or whoever it is that wrote that song very proud.  (Quite frankly, I like your version better.  The other goes REALLY slow.)

      Hell no he won't beat you up, and if he tries it'll give me an even better reason to make meal out of his face. And yes, I'm not such a big guy, but he is fat, and that's all that needs to be said there. Heheheh. And a slick "hell yah" to ridding the evyl babysitter from your household.  Well...to make a long story less long...after the pageant we had a little mini-concert in my garage with another band called Stutter. We played our set (sucked more or less) and then Stutter got on and played one song. The parentals knocked on the door to inform us that we were being shut down...simultaneously two cop cruisers pulled up. The cop got out and made some remarks on my makeup (but was being really cool about it), asked if there was any drinking (no). J.H. brought a Gene Simmons mask and the cop asked if we had all gone to the show when KISS came here, a chorus of yeses and nos. He asked who was playing Money on the bass a couple of minutes ago, and said that Pink Floyd destroys all. Keep that mask in mind, by the way.  So, here I am in a mild state of confusion, feeling pretty tired and suddenly I see Gaddis jerk around in the garage (I was a little outside) and put his finger to his lips. I listened and heard someone playing the drums. The door from inside flew open and out comes my mom hissing that the cops are right there in the front yard. I ran inside and yelled, "Moron, the cops are looking right at you!" And the IRONY: it was a  cop  playing the drums! He asked one of the guys how to do a roll, and he was really good at it. Then, part two: the first cop to come in asks if he can wear the mask. Scrambles to get a camera. My mom got a camcorder.  The drumming cop gave us a little speech about how he can only ask us to stop but he can't enforce it because Williamson has no noise ordinances. He asks, "Ready?" We shout our approval, the one cop, now fully masked, and the other cop who just gave the speech, turn to face the camera with Gene Simmons tongues a-loll and devil horns straight at the lens. Needless to say, the aftermath was armageddoneous roaring...I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. Then they bid us a good'n and left.  The video is absolutely amazing, I'll have to show everyone.   Alright self, breathe!

Take that, evil baby-sitter!  Wow, congrats on 2nd place!  Don't be bitter about Fredi's boobs.  They're implants.  It's part of the gender-reassignment surgery. Don't ever tell him I said that.

And the coolest thing ever happened last night, Gaddis had better tell you or I'm going to blow up his house, it was just that cool. And I'm sure he will. Raugh, alright, tonite has been crazy and I'm freaking the hell out like no other. It's time to do something low-energy. If anyone reads this, tell the boys of Badmoon that I won't be there, I have to make up for the fact that the cops came out here last night. Yeah.   Alright, peace.

And my sis can cover the frosh (under my influence of course, this is "let's overexaggerate Josh so he can transfer his sway to Linds's campaign"). And the juniors, I'll get the ones you miss and what not.  Your campaign slogan should be..."Lindsey Reid...it rhymes with seed." heheh Or, "Lindsey Reid, I have guns, and I'm willing to share!" I'm sure the psychos will love you. Or "Don't be a feeb, vote Lindsey Reid!" hahah, I laughed out loud on that one and one of the Mexican dudes (I'm at Glen's) came and asked if I was alright. I   I'm gay...April Fools. Either that, or the EMO is getting to me...and it'll be finished Friday so stay tuned.  Is it just me or do I smell snow outside? Wasn't it just spring a couple days ago?

You're my best friend and I need help!) can come over one day (before April 23!) and help me make 8 posters and 2 8-foot banners to campaign.  I also need help convincing people to vote for me- just to get the word out there. Please please please help me.  I really want to win this election, but I need yall's help to do it!!!

      So, Josh, PLEASE tell us about your self-titled Cousin It album coming out in a few days.  We're dying to know about it.  And we all know that you would never take off Abby's Barbie's head.  That would be cruel and naturally we would be forced to beat you up or something.  Also, you WORK?  Oh, and Rosie and I got our "defying the social norm" project approved.  For those who don't know, we're going to McDonald's and eating with a random family there.

      Well man, I'm glad I didn't miss so much...I don't have a computer so if anyone is trying to get to me...not the most effective method in the world. I'm actually slacking at work to type this. And yes, this should be in my BLog, but considering the massive amount of not-posting that's going on here, I thought I would heavien (as in lighten, except the opposite) the load a bit. I'll talk to them.  I haven't bit anyone in a long time. However, a couple of days ago, there were two blueberry muffins left, and Mrs. Mallard took one, and was about to reach for the second...I felt strongly to bite her hand in that moment. God bless that lady. And Abby, I would never take the head off of your favorite Barbie,  ever , and that's an "I'll bleed on it" promise.  Everyone ask me about the Cousin It self-titled album coming out in a few days so I can drop clues and be reclusive about what I'm doing! Rock on, EMO children! Peace.

I've got a little research done, but I haven't even started writing it.  I hate not having a laptop.    I'm heading to AL tomorrow morning, but I'll be home around 8:00pm or so.

      So, is anyone coming or what?  I kinda would like to know, so that I can look for you afterwards.    Linds-- last night after the show (which was amazing and a packed house) we went to Waffle House (theater tradition...but gross) and the BA kids showed up.  I was annoyed cause Alex wasn't there.  I asked this one kid why not and he was like "Oh, Alex like ran out after we were done."  I was sad.  (Giving pouty face).  It's Michael Nelson's birthday!  YAY!

So yeah, in case anyone wanted to send an email, that's where I'll be checking.

      Good lord, Skee. The man has voices talking to him, and that's no joke. Like, does he do that thing with his hands? You know? I think he's trying to bat away demons or something. And he has this volume fluctuation problem. He's sounds like a kamikaze pilot that can't decide whether to die or not.   Keep your eye on the prize, man, that's all I'm saying. Skee really doesn't matter past money, and he doesn't furnish much of it anyway, so forget him. And Adams...that Adams. The guy is just crazy, it's because he's getting to be senile early since everyone wants to be friends with him. I don't know, it's just one of those weird things in nature or whatnot. But hey, maybe Skee will have a sudden random hand spasm while driving one day during the summer and the council minus Skee will fall under the control of Bayrd or Adams or someone cooler.  Yarp. Um, wow. Apple pie is really great, I'm going to pay for this later, said the Anorexia, but it's worth it, a lot, said the Mindless Self-Indulgence. Balance, she is a tricky sort.

      Mr. Adams forgot your name?!?  That's awful!  He probably didn't remember mine either when I went in for speeches yesterday, but he didn't talk to me, really.  Just kept winking and smiling while Skee was berating me.  That man is a freaking jerk.  He's the reason I semi-don't want to be on Student Senate.

      Well Ms. McLemore, that's why we were going to set up the chant! j/k  So.....what's everyone doing the 14th of May?! Hopefully you're coming to Spring Day, because there's a band there that's so heavy, that, to quote Mr. Adams, "I remembered you were a student in my class, but you were rocking so hard, I forgot your name!" Tryouts were superawesome, and we had the whole soccer team and the band before us as an audience. Dude, it was hardcore heavy metal. Ooh, and the band before us with Tyler Rothamel in it (for Abby: they all look like the biggest EMO kids ever (and are)) are doing the song  I Believe In A Thing Called Love ...for those of you that haven't heard of The Darkness yet, for shame! They were pretty good, but no one's going to hit it like the real thing, of course, but still. I tried to convince Nick to do that one, and he was like, "Eh," so I guess it's better that that never went off.  Wow, I need to stop. I'm getting so excited and it's about a month away. We still have to do APs before then, and I need to do the research paper, I'm at the library and I'm supposed to be typing it, but surprise, am not. Williamson Public is a cool place, it's a really nice place, the grounds are really pretty. They're right next to BGA, btw. Hmm....  Alright, so. Time to get started! Peace.

      How did it go?  Oh, show is Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 7:00.  Sunday at 3:00; $8.00 at the door.    Yah, got home last night at 10:30, and still had to study for a Jerry test...which I think I failed...night before at 9:30...tonight probably more like 10:45....tomorrow, only God knows when.  Man, all I can say is "I feel pretty, oh so pretty..."  So, yay.  BUT I do get to have a headset thing, and look really cool and official and stuff...even though nobody really talks to me, but whatever.

      Aye, but I have Spring Day Tryouts at 3:15, so...can we hold off a couple of minutes? Hell, you could come to the tryout or something, I don't think they're really going to do anything about it. And then we'll get on with it.  Tomorrow is going to be awesome, and if we make it (and we probably will, all that has to happen is Leper shows off a bit) Spring Day is going to be cool. Did you know that Kyle Jones is an amazing pianist? Lord, that kid. He laid out the song  Mountain King  like I've never heard it played before. We were like, "Calm down Kyle! God!" I think he's replacing Shaun for Spring Day (aww shucks for him), and then, everyone might actually enjoy listening to these 27891326498716237169324 minute musicals they're planning on.   So woo, I need to calm down. I really laid it out today and I was feeling mighty by the time I left. Nick said my face went past purple and into black when I was screaming "FREEEEEDDOMMMM" today, and that's always a good thing. I'm accomplishing more and more as a vocalist each day.  Wait, what am I doing? I should be ranting on my BLog. Lord, between this and EMO posts, I'm probably going to fill this BLog for all that we haven't over the past school year.  Peace.

      Heh, why sure, I can fit you into my really tight schedule of doing nothing. Yarp, I'll try to see what I can do.  Well yes, I think we can officially declare the body of each of our BLogs, cold and rotting. And it's really sad because, man...these things have history and drama and action and promise and all those really good things that make life worth living...yet, there goes its magnetic appeal. I guess nothing can last forever. Then again, this is me at 3:30 in the morning typing a post because I really have nothing better to do. And I haven't been on in like...forever. I didn't have a computer, but now I do. Isn't that a conundrum. Yes, there was no question mark on that one because if I had said it, that's how flat it would have come out.  Anyway, I enjoyed the Prom, party people. Hey, we'll have to do that again some time. Hey, what do you know? I  do  get to do it again some time, as in two weeks some time! Well that is exciting, this is cool. I have to go get measured out again so I can get another penguin suit.  Wow, 'tis cool making long EMO posts. But hey, nobody reads it anyway, right? So it's fine. I just feel like that if I quit here, I'm not going to have anything to do, and then I'm going to fall asleep, and that would be badish. I'd rather do something cool like make a really stupid random post that, if you're actually still reading this, starts to make no sense. Hey, if you are reading this, you are cool. You're getting in touch with the Josh C. about a year and a half ago. Actually, most of those posts started out like...  "Well, that's it" or "Fuck" or "So I guess I don't really know what the hell's going on anymore" or something to that effect. Ah, the good old days of self-destruction. Did you all know that suicide is actually a method of self-preservation? It's been bugging me that for a survivalistic race, people have the ability to commit suicide, and then I read in that book Ordinary People (it's awesome, if ye all haven't read it) an explination on how it was a means of self-preservation, and I was astounded. Lord, am I rambling. Ooh, I have a good ramble that I really need to make.  The shit's really starting to hit the fan with my mom. I guess that's a lot of the reason why I've become such a self-critical, not myself jerk-off the past couple of...months, I dare say? Yea, I dare. Man, when we go at it, we go at it. There's talk of me moving in with my dad until I graduate, and her...raugh. Like, the other day, she was yelling at me because I had to go and get Julian to film our project, he lives a little ways away, so she was upset at him at first, and then I said I was going to go get him, well...wasn't too happy. But here's the best part: she went, "I'm paying for this gas in this car!" and I was like, "Well no ma, I filled it up this morning with my own money," and then she went "I bought you this amp just now!" and I said, "I told you I'd pay you back for it, you said to not worry about it!" and then she said something about being ungrateful...that really gets me. I know that a lot of the time being...I dunno, over-grateful makes me look like a loser subconsciously, I tend to draw out my thank yous and sorries, and mostly, I blame myself for damn near everything, even right now I'm blaming myself for that whole fight, and for everytime that I went EMO tonite, and sadly, that all just accumulates and screws me over even more the next time I have to do anything...overwhelming guilt. So anyway, she accused me of being ungrateful, and I basically screamed back that if she didn't want to provide me with the things she does, that she didn't have to, because I'm not asking for them. She's always saying that I'm such a nice kid and so grateful most of the time, but I swear, when I put her out enough to shake her nerves a little, god in heaven, I'm suddenly the bastard child of the universe. It sucks because I know I have to work it out, and I don't know how, I feel like I've forgotten how to talk to her, maybe even how to talk in general, I don't really know. I mean, I talk a lot but I don't really say anything worth it.   I'd really like to know how all of this started sometimes. I mean, I'd even like to go back into yesteryear and figure out when the hell my head got so screwed up. It's scary to think about how normal I was right before ninth grade started. And now I'm this crazy bipolar paranoid fucking nutcase with a moody penchant and a tendency to either ball it up inside or let it all out to the point where I don't even know what the hell I'm feeling that's real or what I think I might feel that's real, if that makes any sense. I'm seriously trying everything I can to stop this but everything seems to wind up stupid. I feel like some things work for a while, but then they quit and leave me screwed again, til I can pick up some new addiction and curb the burn for a while. Wow, I don't even know why this all came out. I think it's because I've seen all this happening, and I can't stand it. I guess that maybe I think of all these people I see that are just like me in this respect, and I guess they sound so fake that it makes me sick. I really need to stop talking so that you guys don't institutionalize me (just yet).  Well, on a lighter note, while trying to type people just now, I spelled it "oekieke". Beats me where the hell that came from. Sigh. I guess I'll find something else to do. Sorry for being so damned EMO once again.

      I think mine may be allergies too... who knows?  Yes, I was at SATs, but not IIs, just the regular one.    And it's not that he stood over, but that he was telling them who to vote for.  They are supposed to stand over in case someone can't read well enough to hit the "VOTE" button.

      Abby M. as well, altho she describes it as "allergies". Were you at SAT IIs this morning? Am I that blind?   Exactly, whoever can tell? I don't think Cary should get all the blame for this, since I doubt he was being serious. Robbie stood over mine, I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to (wonderful Australian ballot)...not that I care so much. But hey, who knows....  Glad to hear that you're betterer Lindseyreid.

      Who's the other sick person? (By the way, I'm doing mucho better now)  And did they announce the original winners?  Or did they just let yall know that Cary screwed with the votes?  I can't believe that he did that.  According to Tao Tao, Cary was standing over the 1th grade thingy telling people who to vote for.  I seriously doubt that people will change their votes, but who can ever tell?  I still say that Catherine wins.

      Dude...we shoulda taken the trip to that doctor...don't say I didn't tell you so.  HEY, good news! Cary McNamara screwed with the votes somehow so they're re-doing the whole election by paper ballots! I didn't hear exactly what he did, but it was something serious, Keidel came on and talked about it, and then Cary came on and made a school-wide apology. And this morning, all the Student Body Leader People (Robbie, Cary) were walking around going, "Dude, something big is up, they won't even tell us what's happening." They called all the candidates back in this morning, and by the time I got back, they straightened it all out. So hey, here comes another shot at it. And this time I'll tamper with the polls.  I'll have a piece of strep with a slice of bronchitis and some inflamed lymph nodes on the side. Get better, sick people (numbering two as of now)!!

      Wow, I'm really sick.  I stayed home today.  Hope people didn't think I was a big loser and stayed home causeI lost.  Oh well.  Anyway, I have no idea what I have.  I think it's just a bad sinus infection, but Daddy said it may be bronchitis.  Again.  Isn't that wonderful.  May have a side of strep, too, but no one really knows.  That's what happens when mommy isn't here to take me to the doctor, and Daddy's ego gets so big that he thinks I don't need one.  Anyway, I'll probably see most of yall at the SAT tomorrow. Josh, hope you had fun on your French adventure.

      That would have been awesome. Hey, if you had done a striptease too like Catherine probly did, that ho. "YOU BASTARDS, I'll be the best damn secretary this side o' the Mississip!" Discharge dual Yosimite Sam pistols at any time during this segment.   Dude, I think that you would have made a great secretary, and um...I guess we could all pretend that you are, if you really really need that sort of consolation. But that's really up to you. :)  Man. I wanted to see the speeches, too. And I'm not going to be there tomorrow and something great is going to happen. Like, maybe Kelly is going to break down and confess that truly, deep down inside, she's a black-hearted bitch that wants nothing more than rampant debauchery all over the world, but at the very least, she likes to subtly screw with people's (self-pointing) grades. Have fun in the sun for me! And I'll be enjoying snails!  Oh, and a chant tomorrow if I see you. But I'm telling you, if you didn't get one, no big. They're a bit overrated.

      No chant... *sigh*  Catherine Mcdonald got one though.  Kinda.  They just clapped real loud and "woo wooed" a lot.   Unfortunately, no guns or violence mentioned, and just a bit of prostitution.  Ok, so not too much, but it carried over from Kelly's class.  For the most part just boring.  Especially the second time because I'd already seen it once.  But I guess the first time I saw it for you, Josh.  And no damnation!  I wish I'd thought of that.  "I'd be honored to serve as your student body secretary.  Damn you!"  Eh, not quite.

      And technically it isn't eating it, yet sipping...yeah ok, that doesn't make it any better, but it's one of those things dying to be pointed out. And normalacy is so over-rated, anyway, so that could be a compliment.   Man, I know three Jerrys, one is a dick from the best that I ken, one is a rocker and consequently, my ultimate idol, and the last is a gay guy who gives a mean haircut and can draw Tina Turner like snapping his fingers. (random)  So suddenly I realize I'm not going to be there for the speeches...I beg your pardon! But it's ok, I'll get Rob and Alex and Julian to start up the chant without me. And I'll be around Thursday so my vote's in. Speeches are about the best part of the year, and here I am about to miss it. Talk about guns, prostitutes, and violence that need to be eliminated, that'll get their attention. And if not you can go J. Edwards and preach damnation. I know watching that happen would get me going.  Jesus, I need a vacation. Fair night, all.

But good God are they good- too good to call them "pureed fruit" and get away with it.    Anyway, so speeches tomorrow.  I'm oddly not as nervous as I should be.  I'm going first, which sucks, but at least they'll have nothing to compare me to, and at least they won't have been bored out of their minds by everyone else going before me.  *sigh*  I hope it goes well.  Vote for me!  Ms. Medlin doesn't want me to run, though.  Oh well.  She can get over it, I'm sure.

      Dan played Sky.  (For Linds, who knows who he is from Rumors...the one who yelled a lot in the show...)  Friday was just bad.  Thursday and Saturday were really good and Sunday was absolutely hilarious.  So, it's all good.  Maybe now I can go back to my normal routine of doing nothing.  God, now I actually have to see my parents.  Before, I was able to go days at a time without seeing them...or seeing them very briefly.  It was nice.  Anyways, class is over, so I suppose I should head to Jerry's room now.  Wahoo.  Yesterday he made fun of everybody because of what we ate (or didn't) for breakfast.  I had a smoothie...he'd never heard of those before and determined from my description that no normal person would eat pureed fruit.

      Heh, it was a funny show. The lights people had massive ADD and sort of played with them however they wanted. And Sky Masterson...well, whoever he was...made a rousing performance, mostly since every time he hit a note, it was so flat everyone woke up. God bless the guy, he tried hard, and that's all that matters. Well, at least it looked like he tried hard. But you never know.  We were looking for you. I took Jonathan Thompson and Billy was there (eventually), but no dice. But it's all good. You could see Abby if you looked really really hard. I did, and Jonathan said he did, but he's just such an agreeable guy, you never know. Hm.   Yeah, I'm really stalling for time here. I don't want to do this stupid paper. I went to the Mainstreet Festival with my mommy, I cut the grass, I shot the shit with Alex for a while, I'm on here, I've checked my email a couple of times...anything except doing this stupid paper. O well. It's alright because this is the last one for this entire year! Woo! Isn't that scary?  Ok ok, sense of duty just kicked me in the pants, I'm going.

      You should have just printed that out as your project.  I'm sure you could have come up with some kind of BS to explain why it was related to a modern novel.    Abby, sorry I couldn't come to any of the shows.  Trust me, I would have much rather been there than where I was.  Firday actually wasn't too bad, I went to lock in, but I got no sleep.  I was actually planning on coming that night, but mommy made me go buy my grandmother (KY one that you met) a birthday present.  Then on Saturday, we went to my grandmother's house for her birthday and we didn't get back until 10:30 last night.  And then today I had to write this whole research paper about Vietnam and my mommy is going on a cruise so I had to see her off.  I would come tomorrow if you had one.  That would be a perfect time!  But you don't... :(  I'll come to the next one though, ok?  I'm sure yall did great even without me there.  Everybody vote for me on Thursday!  I probably won't be back on here before then.  Things are sooo busy!!!

      Hey, folkses.  Just thought I'd drop by.  Wanted to comment on the ridiculousness of the election thing.  I was laughing hysterically in my head.  I hope that you win this time around, Linds.  The officers that run the election had better be watched like hawks this time.  I wasn't loomed over in my booth, but if I had been, I would have cried foul immediately.  Voting is private, and you all know how I like my privacy.  Anyway, talk to most of you folkses tomorrow.  Hi, Abby!  ;)  ~ZZ

      La la la. I'm sitting here with my dad, he wants to say "hi all". He's on oxycontin right now, and he's laughing hysterically. I really shouldn't be making this post, considering he's under the influence. But still, he says "hi". And he says KTHX! to Linds for being at the hospital yesterday, and so do I, again. Linds is awesome, everyone of us (even me, especially me) should be giving her money! He says: "It really helped to see her smiling face after the fact." He remembers most of yesterday...whoops! But I don't think he's going to remember much after he comes up from this. He's actually on oxy codone , which is percocet. Not that anyone cares, I'm just rambling.  Yeah, I think he fell asleep. I'm going to stop now and make sure his heart is still beating.

      If anything, give me the EMO kid award.  I only have so many average words because I think way too much and actually think that everyone cares what I have to say. I  know  that ninety percent of the time, most of my giant posts go unread, which is ok, because most of it is for personal benefit, and the rest of you can derive what you want from it. I also think it's important to get every thought down, no matter how contradictory or irrelevent, or in some cases, near psychotic. That's just me for ya.  And coming from a kid who wrote a small book in two years, and who's blog on a 56k connection (dial-up, for example if you don't understand in those terms (but you probably do, dear reader (but I'm thinking too much))) takes well over fifteen minutes to publish on bad days, and ten on good ones, this isn't really surprising. But I shall take the award with all the honor and respect that comes with it. I'd like to thank the Academy, and all my adoring fans.  *kiss kiss to the world*

      Thought this was kind of funny:  Will writes approximately 59 words on average per post between the blogs. I write approximately 61. Josh writes approximately 182.  Essays that I had to write in middle school had to be 135 words long.  In essence, Josh has tripled the number of words Will and I write per post, almost doubled the number of words that Will and I writed combined, as well as written posts longer than essays that I have written.  Let's give the boy an award.

      HEY!!! It's been awhile I've been in the pool for like 13 hours this weekend. I was wondering how I would get sunburned....found out. Nice to hear from you but I thought you were going to call. It's weird not having you at my ear for a wk O:-). Anyway somehow I'm writing a gossip column for GSS... yea... oh well it'll be juicy. I don't know who all knows this but my RA, Lisa, wanted a GS couple in her group...well we found one! Satomi, this really cute Japanese girl, is pairing up with this guy from MLK...this same guy that I danced chinese with. It's so cute. I also get to tease her so much...you think I'm oblivious to some jokes....she missed a pool noodle joke... smile! Anyway I gotta go and take care k? Love ya and see ya soon. Oh yea and WRITE ME!!!! I'm starting a letter wall....send a pic too so I can put it on my webpage. Love you again O:-)

      Omg, dudes. I just started playing with the profile thing on BLogger, I am such an EMO kid. I think we've all made more posts than anyone on the whole network. I was just looking around at these wusses, 23 posts ever by that person, 2 posts there, maybe 54 there, next to my massive, and truly EMO  eight hundred seventy three  (after this post) posts! That's sick! I've written enough words for a really goodly sized novel in BLogs (160,000+)! I'd really like to hear about the rest of you, but setting up the profile and all is actual work, albeit not much, but all the same. But if you ever get around to it, let me know.  It's just sick, but it makes sense, the last four on here have been mine. And I run at the mouth so damned much. I shouldn't be freaking out, I should be nodding my head in confirmation, with a confirmatory look on my face, eyebrows down, mouth locked in an "I knew it" or "I just ate a lemon" pose.

      Nothing, man. I just got back from Chattanooga today, pardon me while I upchuck with the excessive glee. Actually, it warn't so bad, and I was talking like a dayum redneck for the longest time! And then I came back home to my Yank family. Sigh. It sucks not being able to say "ah-raht" and "wont" (there's no "a", seriously) and "ain't" (as a commonplace). And they had some mean potato salad.  Anyway...my meds are screwing me up. When I'm awake and walking around, I tend to get depressed, which factors out to tired, and when I lay down, I start to get ultra-ultra manic: mostly cuz I have lots of time to think, so therefore, I can't sleep. It's a vicious, man-eating cycle, but you live and learn and then get Luvs.  I really feel like making a really EMO post back on my blog, and I think I will. No use defiling " The  (notice that) Blog" with filthy rantings.

      Well, I'm home, finally. Colorado was fun. Florida was not.  just in clarification, it's actually my great aunt, and she's the one who came up to help my mother when walt was born.  My great uncle seems to be handling it well. but we really don't know because he really hasn't been alone since her death.   Additionally, my uncle decided he didn't need two cars, so we got his subaru impreza. here's a description separated for easy reading. Girls: Small green hatchback, 1997 model, working air conditioning, Guys: 2.2 liter V4, 230ish Hp, 4WD, 30,000 miles, effortless 90Mph, Power steering, ABS, Power windows/locks, Keyless entry, With pretty good off-road capabilities now that I think about it, none of you really cared about the guys portion, oh well  It feels good to be home again.

      Wow, what a wholly, morbidly silent, and depressing place. Hm. Well. Not too sure my generally unending negativity and gloom will brighten anything, but eh. A stir of life every now and then would be nice, eh? That's the second time I used "eh" in a sentence, once as a question, once as a stand-in for a period. I must be turning Canadian! Cool. Maybe I can be a Mountie. I hope they give me a huge stick, either that or put me on artillery/rock thrower. I really wish I knew what the hell is wrong with me. Actually, I can hear my dad laughing himself to a hemmorhage in the next room, that's probably fueling the fire. I don't know.    sometimes it's just better not to ask   Rock on, all.

      Agh, Will, I'm sorry dude, my condolences. I hope this wasn't a crushing blow to the Will of Whiteside world. Peace out brother, I'll be talking to you soon, and take it easy in Tallahassee (hard as such may be, death is a tricky sonofabitch at times).

      well I don't have much time, (check the clock on this one).  but as of six hours ago I was in colorado, we got a call this morning (Saturday) that my Aunt Anne died and so I'll be in Tallahassee in less than 18 hours (2000 miles/24 hours) so that's where I am. I probably won't check my e-mail but you can call 1-615-830-9683 and leave a message for me. If I don't respond don't take it personally, it's my mother's phone and she's clueless and will probably delete the message before I get near it.

      God, son. In and out faster than bollocks with a fly. But I suppose it's well-warranted this time.  To Linds, I shall say: eh. 'Twas a look. Will of Whiteside really has confirmed it. I'll bring a camera sometime and take a picture of you. It's been a while since this thread ended, I know, yes, yes. But that really needed to be commented upon s'more. It's pretty much got me out of the ass-detonation business (at least to the extent that I'll share with anyone more than the people who are there to witness :):):) i  Peace, buds.

      Linds, I'm gonna have to say you most likely had such a look, seeing as I've been on the recieving end of it a couple of times,   I hope you two had fun, Becca and I were a little bored at crockett Park, but we found kessler so it was alright.

      I had no such look...mostly.  Besides, you went out once. You could have blown up your pocket or whatever then if you had really wanted to- I wasn't watching.  And the second time they went out was for only about 5 minutes because then Seth left with his dad.  So it's not my fault you didn't blow stuff up.  I just kind of guilted you a bit so that you would make the decision I wanted you to make... that's not too bad, is it?  Besides, there's always next year.  Or even this year I suppose- they're still selling fireworkss and stuff over on Granny White or somewhere like that.  I'm glad you got home ok, Josh.  You left and I went into the living room and my mom was like, "yeah, there's a whole big line of storms heading this way.  I hope Josh gets home all right."  Yeah, thanks mom, big comfort there.  But you did get home, and everything is good, so I'm shutting up for now and going to post of your blog because the last post was almost a week ago and it's getting lonely.

      That was the most "but I"s in one paragraph I think I have ever read. Power mirrors are the SHIT! You ever wonder why they call them "power" mirrors? There isn't much "power" behind that. But I guess "moving" mirrors doesn't have all the KAPOW! that " power " has. Fucking psychology for the ignorant.  I couldn't, Rosie. Linds was there when there were bottle rockets. She said I could go ahead, but I would have felt bad. She had that, "Fine, but when you do I'm going to hate you" look in here eye. So I didn't go through with it. Man! That would have been the shit! Hopefully Seth will have sm'more! I will cry.  It's storming like a bloody motherfucker out there. Lordy, this is scary. I'm going to shut this machine down. Peace, brodas. Stay alive.

      I found something else that I didn't mention, it has power side mirrors, I found these quite fun when I was parallel parking, I couldn't see the curb so I stopped and moved the mirror and got a good view of the curb.  and my power locks aren't much fun as most, they don't have a switch, they're just linked directly to the lock on my door, but I do have a window lock, but it doesn't make the cool stereo Klick sound.  but I don't have a cd player, o well

      Well, goddang, son! T'ain't ev'rday somebody just comes home with a really nice Subaru. I was going to say "Eh? The power locks stuff is for girls." And then I remember I still play with mine when I'm bored. So I guess you nailed it.   And you do illustrate a good point. We are the only two classifiable males on this whole damn thing (me probably being more estrogen than androgen, but let's not get into that). That's pretty cool/sad. Not really sad. Just sort of odd. Eh.  In times of doubt...say, "eh". Halleujah! Welcome home Will E.

      Dudes. I would publish mine but I don't have it here. I do know that I have guitar first period, and english 2nd. And chemistry 3rd, I think. I don't really know, it's not here in front of me. Last period of second semester I have guv'ment.   Yes, Linds, I know I'm supposed to be in bed, but I got a trileptal buzz and I can't do it. Har har, this shit is great. And while I'm in such a weird mood, I wanted to let you all know that I got a 5 on the English AP exam, so eat it&nbsp; :)&nbsp; j/k. I'll never do that good again. But yes. Very strange, that. It's a very strange night, I'm going to regret being so boastful in the morning. Not trying to, but...you know. Sometimes these things just happen. I thought I'd die on that one. Eh. Actually, I thought I'd die on U.S. history, but I got a 4 so it's all good. I'm going to shut up now and find some place to fall over, peace all.

      Ok, Abby is now off the blog and there is a new URL that you can see if you look at the settings under publishing.  If yall don't like it, I might change it because I have several ideas.  In fact I may change it anyway if I start liking another one better.  Oh well.  Somebody post, my god!

      ok, since Will has a good point, I'm going to go ahead and take Abby off, since I [obviously] vote to take her off, and I'm pretty sure Josh feels the same way, so there she goes. I am going to wait a little while until I get more feedback before I put Becca on. I still need ideas for a new URL when you people finally get around to checking the blog. Or maybe yall do check the blog and just not post. In that case, please post. It's getting lonely around here.

      Ok, so I was just thinking, and you don't really have to say yes, it's just an opinion thing. (Wow, can you tell I have self-esteem issues, geez.)  Two questions: 1) What do yall think about putting Becca on the blog?  She does seem to be a rather big part of our lives, and quite frankly it just might liven up the blog a little bit.  2)  What do you think about taking Abby off the blog?  She isn't exactly contributing anymore, and I don't know about yall (ok, probably nobody else but Josh) I don't like her being able to see everything that's going on while she's in this little anti-Lindsey mood that she's currently in.  I also wanted to note that the URL of the blog will be changing here in a few days as soon as I get some inspiration for the same reason.  Anyone have ideas?  Ok, just wondering.  Please post your opinion ASAP or it may just not get counted.

      well here you go;  something  there I said something. but anyway,  I feel miffed, you didn't invite me to spend the night, see if I help you with calc, econ, and stat.   :-P   Oh well, that aside, the back bedroom is clean so you can just start living over here, josh don't get jealous, she's not gonna leave you for me.   anyway, after pissing off lindsey and josh, i guess it's rosie's turn, but since she doesn't seem to actually be here...aw well as if that has ever stopped me before.  you're just setting yourself up to be hurt, but you're not gonna listen to me so I don't know why I'm even saying this.  now I don't believe I've left anybody out, but if I have just start screaming at me and I'll rectify the situation.  wow, I just read back over my post and I came to the conclusion that I'm a jerk, someone throw something at me.

      Ok, seriously people, someone say something.  This is one seriously boring blog.  And let's not even start on the subject of Josh's poor blog, which has been neglected for almost a full week.

      Hhahahahahaha, I laughed, I cried, I made the guy sitting next to me very nervous. Vurry good, I'm going to have to remember some of these, and I say remember because I still don't have internet, and the guy next to me, I don't know, of course, being that I actually did go to the library today to look for some directions. Woo! Going to Kentucky Kingdom, the Thrill Park, biotch. Represent. You ready, O Lindsey of Reid?

      Ok, this is my 4th post in a row, but that's ok, I guess.  This is the "unique rabbit" jokes that we were talking about at O'Charley's the other day and I wanted everyone to remember them because they are just so incredibly awful.  I can't believe that I posted this in February of sophomore year.  It seems like yesterday...we're going to be seniors!!! *tear/evil laugh*  I'm sure this was the reason I didn't die from mono- my god, I 've never laughed so hard in my entire life, which I guess looking back on it now must have meant that I was very sick.
