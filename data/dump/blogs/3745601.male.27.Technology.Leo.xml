       Took the personality and looks test for match.com, here are the results.  The thing that I find most interesting is that it says that I like blonde hair.  I have never dated anyone with blonde hair nor do I find it especially attractive.  My friends say I don't like blonde women.  I prefer hispanic\latino women.  It also says I like mainstream women...    You're a hidden prince  You bring real passion to your life. To you life is about connecting emotionally with the people in your life and trying to make a difference in the world around you. You refuse to settle long-term for a boring job or doing something just because it's expected of you. Love is the same way. Despite your natural charm, you can't pretend to care for someone if you're missing a deep connection. You know what real love feels like and you'll accept no imitations! You're ready and able to experience romance and a powerful "spark" with someone special.    Do women like your type?   Notice that 43% of women are generally attracted to your personality type. 2% say they are VERY attracted. 1% say they are turned off by these traits.   How unique is your type?   Looking at over 10,000 men who have taken the test, about 75% have very different beliefs, values, and habits.   What's dating all about to you?   Falling in love is a spiritual experience for you. A truly loving relationship helps bring meaning to your life. You try hard to make your date feel comfortable and have a good time. You're good at anticipating what other people need and giving it to them. You're constantly trying to find the "rules" for successful dating but often find they don't work.    Favorite Qualities  Your choices suggest a woman over 30 may be a little old for you  Mainstream, lovely women  Sharp, narrow chins  Wide and angular "diamond" or heart-shaped faces  Blonde hair    Favorite Looks  There's something about the energy and youthful appeal of "Cheerleaders" that's hard to resist. We use this name to describe a group of women who's facial features combine feminine beauty with a "tomboy" flair. They usually have blonde or light brown hair--cut short, small button noses, and wide smiles. These aren't "perfect" beauty contest winners. But their vivacious personality comes across even in photographs and makes their overall impression one of dazzling beauty.   There's a reason why you can't keep your eyes off a beauty pageant. We describe a lot of the women you also found attractive as "Beauty Queens," because of their flawless beauty and winning smiles. These women usually have long, shiny hair setting off a face that is either rectangular or heart-shaped. They have very feminine features like thin noses, big eyes, and full lips, conveying a strong, confident look rather than looking delicate or fragile. Even though they look like the "Girl Next Door," they tend to look mature for their age and lack the "cutesy" appearance of more "girlish" women. Although very popular to look at, most men are sort of intimidated by this type, which is probably why only 1 in 3 (31%) say they specifically seek out these women.   Favorite Face Type  You especially liked a pattern scientists refer to as "Ectomorphs." Geometrically, they are similar to triangles, because they are widest at the cheekbones and then narrow to a relatively pointed chin. Women Ectomorphs tend to have long, narrow noses and prominent cheekbones. Historically, these faces have been viewed as delicate, and combined with the typical lean build, can give a very feminine overall impression.

      You know, Moore is being lauded as an intellectual, but he really just sees his point of view and doesn't want to look at the truth.

      After I complained about not being able to find any of my old friends, Murphy's Law kicked in.  I was contacted the other day by one of them.  I'll keep you updated on my continuing efforts to find them all.

      And some more from the 'wonderful' match.com; too bad they can't find a cute single girl in my area.  Is it me or have all the cream of the crop already been taken?  It's not like I am looking for Ms. Perfect.  I do have expectations.  I'm not going to just jump on anything that comes my way.  On the bright side, my hairstylist is very attractive.  The downside of this is that I know she at least has been married.  I don't know if she is separated or divorced. (Hopefully the latter)  Maybe if I know her a little better, I will ask her out.     urlLink          urlLink          urlLink          urlLink          urlLink       With reviews like these, how could I be without a girl?  Try doing a search on available women in my area with whatever online dating service you prefer and you will see. (trust me, I know I have searched them)

      You know, my personal political opinions are just that... Opinions.  I don't presume to know the thoughts or directions that my pick for the presidential election has or is going.  As a matter of fact, I am so riled up about this, I am probably coming across as an uneducated redneck hillbilly.  What I would like to see is one, just ONE 'intellectual' actually point out all the negative traits that their pick has.  You know what the problem with that position?  It would require the person to see the truth.  Let us get a couple of 'truths' out in the open.  Kerry is about as trustworthy as a serial child molester being your babysitter.  Bush is about as competent as a kindergartener at rocket science.  This is the choice that we have in our next election.    Personally, I have no idea what either has for a platform.    Kerry has put more advertisements on t.v. than Bush.  However, he must think that people from WV are idiots as not a single thing has been said in them.  They are the 'feel good' type that say nothing about where he stands on issues.  Of course, if you could actually pin an issue on him other than LIBERAL, I will give you a cookie.  Doing some research on my own I have found that Kerry has voted for almost everything I support...  That being said, he has also voted against everything I support.    In the infamous (almost correct) words of Forrest Gump,  " John Kerry  is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get."   (substitution of  John Kerry  in place of  Life  is mine)  For each day that something new comes out about the Bush administration, I am astounded at the lack of leadership ability of the man in charge.  Sure we all knew that he wasn't the brightest bulb in the bunch by his speeches when he was first elected.  I would assume that someone at that level would know their weaknesses and surround themselves with people who were the best at their jobs.  Apparently, Bush did neither.  As for his platform... I dunno, raising money?  Bush = Gump

      Have you ever tried to find people from your past?  There are a couple of old military buddies that I have been trying to find for years now.  Other than the 'pay us a million and we ensure you results' online rip offs, I've tried everything that I can think of to try.  It's really unfortunate as these are guys that I would love to see where they are at in their life.  It would be like a high school reunion without the people you don't want to see.  You know, I don't think it is possible to find people without hiring someone.

         Warning-- This post is pretty long.&nbsp; I don't expect anyone to read all of it, but it is here as a resource if you want to read it.&nbsp; The first section with the links is just there as reference material for the last section that has the costs association.&nbsp; Scroll near the end to see the actual cost    &nbsp;       &nbsp;  *Edited:&nbsp; 07/17/04*   I've decided to document a couple things about the two people running for President here as a way of centralizing the research I have found on both parties.&nbsp; Today I'm going to post my research on Kerry and  next week I'll do one on Bush .&nbsp;&nbsp; I think my favorite is about Kerry promising to break his promise.&nbsp; At the bottom I have posted the cost, as I could find them, of the promises he has already made.&nbsp; What I find interesting is that he promises to lower our taxes and also spend more... that doesn't make cents.&nbsp; He says that he is going to get his money from taxing the rich.&nbsp; How many rich people do you personally know?&nbsp; How much money can he possibly raise by taxing a couple people?&nbsp; Now I know it is more than that.&nbsp; Somewhere along the lines of 3 million millionaires with about 38,000 having more than 10 million.&nbsp; What you have to compare that to is the 350 million of the rest of us working joes.&nbsp; By the way, those numbers sound good, but you have to take away 1 million of the millionaires if you want someone who actually has that much in cash.  urlLink Source  Also next week&nbsp;I'm going to talk a little about food.  &nbsp;    Hispanic immigration plan   urlLink Source   &nbsp;  Expanded college access   urlLink Source   &nbsp;  Kerry Promises to Break His Promises   urlLink Source   &nbsp;  Kerry Promises to Create, Keep Jobs in U.S.   urlLink Source   &nbsp;  Kerry promises closer relations with Latin America   urlLink Source   &nbsp;  Kerry promises, if elected, to lift ban on immigrants with AIDS   urlLink Source   &nbsp;  Kerry promises to be president for all   urlLink Source   &nbsp;  Sen.

       Haven't updated in a couple days and I apologize to you reader(s?) out there.&nbsp; I have had a boring couple of days.&nbsp; I'll update you on my life at the end of this post.&nbsp; First, I've a topic that I found interesting.&nbsp;  urlLink Gator  has a post about men getting women's phone number.&nbsp; She feels that we view the number as the trophy.&nbsp; While I can understand her angst at not being called by the young gentleman, I would like to attempt a rebuttal.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Asking for a number isn't like a trophy.&nbsp; The trophy comes when you actually get a working number and not Taco Bell.&nbsp; The problem is that most girls don't have the guts to tell a guy that she isn't interested in him.&nbsp; This leads to mixed signals.&nbsp; You gentlemen out there can will have no problem agreeing with me when I say that the less mixed signals that a girl gives you the better.&nbsp; Ladies, it's not like men are known for their perception; nor their understanding of the opposite sex.&nbsp; So in this scenario, she is shady with him.&nbsp; Now, instead of just being rejected, he has been duped.&nbsp; You've doubled the pain.&nbsp; I normally weigh the signals&nbsp;the girl was giving.&nbsp; I base my decision to call the number she gave me on  if  she seemed interested.&nbsp; I still get the occasional number of a friend or a restaurant.&nbsp; This comes with the territory.&nbsp;       My Life     I forgot to call my sister and my brother on their birthdays.&nbsp; They were born one year and two days apart.&nbsp; What really stinks is that I had been looking forward to calling them.&nbsp; I let life get into the way and didn't set my priorities right.&nbsp; I would have completely forgotten had I not received an e-mail from my step-mother.&nbsp; So long story short, I need to get up a couple hours early tomorrow and call my brother and my sister.   &nbsp;  My mom called me day before yesterday.&nbsp; She hadn't heard from me in a couple weeks and was missing me.&nbsp; As you can tell I have been dropping the ball on my family.&nbsp; I think this is something I need to work on.

      I have had a busy week.&nbsp; My sister is getting married this Saturday.&nbsp; Penguin and my cousin Tank came over this week and we hung out for a couple days.&nbsp; I had a lot of fun, but I didn't get anything done.&nbsp; I had planned on getting caught up on my laundry as I was down to one towel.&nbsp; I also had plans to finish my research on President Bush.&nbsp; Finally, I wanted to join a gym that I had found about two blocks from work.&nbsp; It wasn't much to do, but once again, I allowed life to run me around in circles.&nbsp; I didn't get one thing done.&nbsp; So this week, I am going to buckle down and get things accomplished.&nbsp; Tank's dad is going through a divorce.&nbsp; It is heartbreaking to see.&nbsp; Divorce is... I hope I never  ever  have to go through one.&nbsp; My mom has been divorced three times.&nbsp; I have seen first hand what kind of damage happens.&nbsp; The people that go through them are never the same.&nbsp; I'm going through withdrawal symptoms.&nbsp; I haven't read a book in about two weeks.&nbsp; I haven't even had time to go to the bookstore and look at them.&nbsp; I also haven't been to a movie since seeing Spiderman.&nbsp; I promised I would write something about food this week, and since I didn't get to research Bush, I figure I can at least write about food.&nbsp; A really good friend of mine, Popeye, called me yesterday about 11am.&nbsp; I hadn't went to sleep yet so I hopped up and answered it.&nbsp; Anyway, I ended up having lunch with him.&nbsp; We went to&nbsp; urlLink Uno's Chicago Grill &nbsp;in Teays.&nbsp; Our waitress was fairly attractive and I was running late to meet Popeye, so when she asked my what I wanted, I told her to order me her favorite.&nbsp; She brought me a dish called Rattlesnake&nbsp;Pasta.&nbsp; It's sauteed chicken and penne in a creamy cheddar-jalapeno sauce with a dash of&nbsp;tabasco.&nbsp;Anywho, it was one of the better dishes I have had from there.&nbsp; She said it was supposed to be spicy, but other than the couple of jalapeno's, it wasn't hot at all.&nbsp; I ended up talking more than eating.&nbsp; But, this just left me with some leftovers to put in my refrigerator.&nbsp; Well, with all the talk of food, I am now hungry.&nbsp; I'll post as soon as I can, but until my sister gets married, I won't have much time.

      I know that I have promised you a day dedicated to anti-Bush articles as I have dedicated one to anti-Kerry.&nbsp; I keep putting it off.&nbsp; It is not for lack of trying.&nbsp; My main source of references have been found by using meta-search engines online.&nbsp; In my anti-Kerry entry, a vast majority of my references were from respected institutions like the washington post and the new york times.&nbsp; I have been searching for anti-Bush articles without much luck.&nbsp; The only entries I find are from people who have a definate chip on thier shoulder about Bush.&nbsp; I don't know if this is&nbsp;a lack of media coverage for Bush or a lack of credible information.&nbsp; With Kerry, I did not need more than several hours to find the information that I linked.&nbsp; But fear not my friend, I have not given up the search.&nbsp; I am determined to find what information I can about the President and compile it here.&nbsp; I am hoping to have it within the next week. Though, if I continue to have the same luck, I have no idea when it will be done.&nbsp; My goal is to have two sections dedicated to the two candidates so that I may compare and contrast them at my leisure.&nbsp; I am trying to find information on what Bush did prior to Sept. 11th in his first year compared to what he did after.&nbsp; I do not agree with the way Bush has handled the issues put before him, but I would like to give both him and Kerry a non-biased chance to get my vote.&nbsp; Eventually, I would also like a section detailing the positive traits of each candidate.&nbsp; I feel the media gives us enough biased negative information.   My sisters wedding was perfect.&nbsp; I swear she looked like one of the models that you see in the wedding magazines.&nbsp; I did not avoid the "When are you going to settle down?" question.&nbsp; My great-grandmother (bless her heart) posed the question to me&nbsp;as soon as she could at the reception.&nbsp; She then followed it up by a quick "Don't worry, you have plenty of time." pity statement that all people tend to give singles.&nbsp; I agree with  urlLink Maisy Day  in this entry of her's that being single is not a disease.&nbsp; It is not something that can be 'cured'.   Tank stayed with me again this past Monday.&nbsp; I am really glad that I am getting the chance to hang with him before he goes to the  urlLink Art Institute of Pittsburg .&nbsp; The guy is so talented it hurts, but so humble he doesn't know it.&nbsp; Penguin did not come by this past week.&nbsp; I did see him on one day, but I think I picked on him a little too much.&nbsp; I was agrivated at a percieved slight and took it out on him.&nbsp; I had a really great lunch with Popeye this past Tuesday at Applebee's.&nbsp; It was short, but helped me see the bigger picture with what is going on in my life.&nbsp; The service  and  the food were great.&nbsp; Popeye said his steak was not as good as he has had in the past.   I am currently doing a little light reading of some works of  urlLink C. S. Lewis .&nbsp; I have come to the conclusion that he  is  a great thinker.&nbsp; I know it is not news for many of you, but I am not one to take someone at thier word.&nbsp; I have to research it and see it for myself.

      I just realized how long it has been since I have last posted. I have been in a funk for a couple weeks. I think I just needed a vacation from thought. I had been too involved with the whirlwind of life without taking time to live it.      Recent news ...   My company landed the contract I have been working on for the past nine month. My grandparents have finished moving into their new house. One of the 'three amigos' from my past has come into town. He is moving to  urlLink Perth , but wanted to say his goodbye's to us. He has changed from going by Don, his given name, to his new nickname Dax. I have a high school reunion next month.(if anybody knows anyone up for a free meal to be my date, drop me a note) I just received a call from a coach to play in  urlLink WV's amateur soccer  league. I can't wait.  This is really, really funny.  urlLink http://jibjab.com/default.asp    I need to find a place other than Uno's to hang out.  If you guys have any suggestions, I'm all ears.
