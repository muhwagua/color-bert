       I've been kinda burned out lately. It's just that I feel like I have too much to do. You see, on friday I went on a field trip to the Collage of the Canyons.(a community college in Valencia) THEY seemed less stressed out than me.  These are college kids! I guess because they actually get to CHOOSE what classes they want and when to attend. Why can't those of us in lower grades like middle school get to at least choose our class times? I can understand not choosing what classes, but I bet that plenty of teachers( as well as students ) would love to wake up at least an hour later. I know that I don't function well in the morning and would actually prefer a noon class so that I would  at least be awake for school. Now I find myself going kinda down in my grades 'cause( besides being under pressure to keep up my 4.0) I have been told that in my gifted classes, any grade that I get actually counts as one grade higher. so if I get streight b's, it would still be a 4.0 average. I'm willing to get streight b's, but I just feel a duty to myself to keep getting streight a's. That just is tearing me up bit by bit.

                " I hate linkin park "  not me, it's just a quote from one of my friends. She can like manufactured pop, but not soulful, expressive, literate music? There are more of you out there. I bet not a damn on of you can give me a good, honest reason why. Anything that you can say to show me that linkin park is a bad band, I can turn right back around on you. Here's just a few examples:                         #1- LP sux because they set a bad example for our children w/ their bad words and hateful words.                                                                                         reply- y single them out? If they don't learn this stuff from a song they WILL learn this stuff from other places. And what about them is hateful? Excuse me, but is there not a war going on right now? Aren't there hate crimes going on?  Where do you think they will learn hate from? Not from these things and not from a band that they may not even understand the lyrics to.                                                                                         #2- they are only a good band because they are on MTV                                                                                         reply- You could say that for any band or artist dumbass!!!!!!    like I said, just give me a reason and I WILL reverse it! That is a guarentee. I cannot believe that some of you LP haters can bag on linkin park, yet like manufactured pop. Now don't think I am a hypocrate for saying that a certain type of music is bad. I unlike you freakin' LP haters DO have reasons for hating the songs.You want to say that linkin park sets a bad example, How about saying that britney spears sets a bad example? Have you seen a few of those outfits she has worn? This is what the nations girls idolise. An impossible image like that will make any girl want to diet, vomit after eating, and work out like a gym junkie. so shove THAT up you're ass!!!!!!!!!!!

       Is it just me or does reality T.V suck? I know it was fun at first, but now it's just a load of crap. Who wants to see some idiots be" married by america" . Thats not entertaining to me. It's just a constant reminder that T.V producers have run out of good ideas. It might be a tough job to come up with something original, but when you just have a few families to compete to see which  should get their own show, thats just not trying. hey! I just had a thought! * people in shock *  how about just having people tell producers what they want to see? so that way you people in the T.V buisness don't have to rack you're brains to think of something entertaining. Here's another idea!  *more shock *   Don't be afraid to put more money into something that people want to see. You're gonna get that money back from the raitings aren't you? If no one wants to be on you're show, tell them to go to hell! Then do some open casting. Just don't make another crappy show about it! Now to tell off those who want to be movie stars. If you're an aspiring actor, be a GOOD actor!!!!

       I am so pissed at a few people. A few days ago, I was talking to some of my ffriends and all of a sudden, some jerk came up to me and said" hey kid, didn't you hear? wrestling is fake!!!!!" so I'm about to go all out on this guy. But I controled my temper and asked him if he had ever actually even taken a bump. Naturally he said no. so I asked him what compelled him to say that wrestling was fake if he had no experience in the wrestling world. I don't claim to know whether it's fake or not, but at least I don't claim something I don't know for sure. I just get so angry thinking that anyone would claim something that is really uncertain to them.

       I'm here today to talk about a disease that has been deteriorating my mind for some time. I want to talk about little kids. Not that they are bad, it's just that I have seen this thing on T.V called kidz bop.Uuuuuuuugh! I want to destroy those children of satan. Apperantly, this is a copellation album which holds many popular songs. The twist is, kids sing the songs. This makes me sick. Songs are a form of poetry, am I right? These artists pour they're hearts and souls into the songs they write to express themselves and have they're thoughts known. But the kids of the world, for the most part, are unaware of this. To them, music is just cool sounds and " interesting " lyrics. For example, when I ask my little sister if she knows what the meaning of a song is, she says" can I hear it? ". So I put the song on and at the end of it she says ( let's say that the song is hit me baby one more time ). She says " Oh, it's about a girl that's getting hit " I know that people are allowed to have different opinions about poetry, but when you take the content of a song literally without thinking about any of the symbolism and metaphors, that is just missing the point. And I'm sure that at least half the kids on those albums ( probably more ) are just like her in taking every piece of lyrical content literally. That just makes me sick.

       rain is good!!!!!!!!!!!!! its so moody and relaxing. The only thing that ccomes close is taking a bath in the dark. Thats where ive thought about what to type on my blogs. That is, until it started to rain. There's just something about it that is really soothing and calming like a silky bunny. Especially when there are floods everywhere. Damn i wanna go swimming now. I think i have become one with the water in recent years. ever since i did a moonsault into the pool i never wanted to get out. As soon as the pool opens, i will be the first one in there. Mabey, its not the rain thart relaxes me, but the water that the rain brings.  wow. im dedicating my blog time today to rain and water. how sad for me.

       this may piss off a lot of my friends, but i need to talk about pokemon. it started off as just 150 to memorize. I really hate those shows that exaggerate the powers of things, but those things are just so fucking adorable. After the indigo league ended, thats when everything went bad. Its just like the power rangers. At first everything was going good. but then they chenged the things around just because they couldnt think of any new story lines. All of a sudden they started the orange and johto leagues that just sucked. And is anyone else sick of hearing about pikachu or what? i think they paid someone to say: pika pika.....................pikachu. and then never talked to them again I bet thats what they did. there is only one show i could tolerate that exaggerate the powers of their charachters. any who...............i'll let you people lement on how you so eagerly enjoyed wasting money on you're damn pieces of paper you cal pokemon and yu-gi-oh cards.

       I gots to talk about some stuff. A few months ago my friend Royt decided to tell my friend Jenny that he liked her. Unsure of what would happen, he decided to ask me to tell her that he liked her (trysaying that 5 times fast). So I did and people got suspicious of my level of friendship w/ her. This only lasted a week. Anywho, she gave him a note saying that she did not feel the same way. Roy wanted to know why. So once again, here comes Eddie walking up to Jenny and the rumors of a relationship between the two of us. After struggling to get an answer out of her, she cracks and gives it away. As it turned out, she did not like Roy because.............. he was (dundundun)...UGLY!!! That was the most fucked up thing that I have ever heard.And I've heard some pretty fucked up stuff. I never thought my friends would judge who they liked based on how they looked.And that was even more wrong seeing as she was no prize herself and he did not care.After a few days of pain anguish ,and anger Roy wanted to at least stay friends. so on valentines day,as usual, he gave candy hearts to all his friends. He gave one to Jenny as a token of friendship, only to recieve a crude response "Roy, I do not like you. I will never like you. Stop stalking me!!!" what a bitch. He said it was just to be friends, and she gave a mean reply that was completely unneccesary. Now he is asking me if there is anyway to get her to like him. well just tell me one thing...............where is the guy in the middle supposed to go when he needs help? I know you have your problems but so do I. I'm trying to keep 2 people as friends and not become their messenger boy. I should back out of it, but they will never forgive me. I know this because I know them. And after countless attempts to explain to them both that they are idiots, but they don't get me so i guess i'll just have them sort this out themselves.....no matter what happens.

       I need to get to high school. At least there I will be able to express myself more openly instead of being confined to reveal my inner thoughts in this little box. I know I can just as easily write a poem or sing a song to show how I feel, but instead of thinking of one of those things, I'm going to just blurt stuff out:  I've been going to bowling club after school every thursday for the entire year now. At first it was just for fun, I think that is what won us the first place trophy(go team 15). Now it's just to get away from the tention of school and home. It's not like I have a lot of crap going on, It's just that I have nowhere else to talk about what DOES go on around me. Now I seem to be bowling backward games. I start w/ strikes and the next frame only gets me gutter balls. I truly believe that this stems from what I have stated above. My stress test has revealed that I only have an 8% stress level. Yet I sometimes feel like ripping my hair out, super glueing it back on, and starting the whole scalp deminishing process again. So there must be some other form of stress or another thing that's hurting my brain and causing me to need this little box to talk to.

       Apperently I am going to be in a play that I never even auditioned for. I just got pulled out of class and rushed to the auditorium. I didnt even know what I was doing until I got to the auditorium. As it turned out, I was taking part in a safe schoool program and we were showing what NOT to do at school. My part is to sexually harrass a girl and to fight w/ some guy I dont even know just for the hell of it. I know this is supposed to be good for the school, but they should have asked me if I wanted to do it 1st. I guess they chose me because I am good at acting (so i've been told) , but it was still pretty rude to pull me out for the thing. Especially since they had a whole week left to get a person. I know that there are tons of people in the school who are dying to get up on stage and get noticed. But hey, this counts as school service and I need some, so I guess I can't complain. The rest of the play is funny as hell.some girls get in a cat fight that looked so real at rehersal that the sponsor broke it up. then there is going to be a scene where this guy an dgirl are approched by a group of other girls. They think that she has been talking crap about her them, so before it gets ugly, the guy w/ her broke them up. The leader of the girls says " hey ...............hwo dis yo?" so the girl says "that's my boy ya stinkin queefer!" So they're about to go at it when a girl in the audience goes" oh you did not just say that! That is  my man and if you think he's yours than you got some problems girl!" I think you can tel what will happen. Anyhwo, the rest of the show is really funny. Just wish my 10 readers could see it.

       We finally had a uniform-free day at my school!!! I was happy because I was tired of putting on the same stuff for almost the whole week long.You'd think this was the greatest day ever, but as usual, good things don't last too long. It turned out that all of my friends pay attention to Joan Rivers. I had worn this really comfortable Old Navy stuff that I always wear. EVERYONE had on jeans and a t-shirt.Or at least 500 of them. That's more than one-third of the school. So I was like who cares , since what matters most is comfort. Almost everyone was commenting about clothes. That is the worst conversational subject I could think of. There are tons of stuff going on that affect the way we live. Yet people chose to talk about things that don't matter for anything at all. If you were stranded on a deserted island w/ only 2 outfits to choose from to conceil your shame, would you rather wear the latest fall fashions or some sport pants and a really comfy shirt of some sort? Only the queen of crappy talkshow Joan rivers would choose the fasionable piece of shit that is probably dry clean only and would get dirty on the sand and dust of that island. And if you are going to talk about, eeeeeeeewwwww.......fashion, then at least have the decency to not put down others for what they wear.  Why make others feel bad because they don't wear what's hot. Call that what you will, fashion inspection, clothing review. All I see is another form of segregation.

       I don't know why some people( mostly girls ) have told me that I am " such a guy " . this gets me so pissed. I mean I dont tell dogs " oh my good u r such a dog. what a bunch of stereotypical bull crap. If some guy likes football, so be it. if you find a guy talking about cars, go ahead and call him a gear head. But don't say they are " such guys". Because not all guys know about cars and watch football. And besides, it dosen't hurt to know a thing or two about these subjects. They can help to interact better w/ people who know about these things. And car know-how can help greatly if u r ever stuck w/ out help. Anyway, I know more girls that know about this stuff than guys. Would it b fair to call them men? I don't think so! Another thing, I have noticed that on some on-line tests, ( a gender guessing test ) that if there is a question such as what number do you preffer, they give you two choices. What if you don't happen to like any of them? are u supposed to just pick one? That could damage you chance of having the right sex picked. And any way, if you pick everything that would judge you as a member of the opposite sex should they say you are that gender? That just seems stupid to me. The only way you could tell for sure is by checking your birth records. I think you all get my point by now.If you don't you're either incredibly narrow-minded, or an idiot. so till next time.........keep an open mind .......please. Mabey I could finally get out of this little space I'm surrounded in if the people around me did just that.

       i dont wanna say that 6th graders r horrible people, but if u went to my school, i'm sure you would agree w/ me in saying that most scrubs ( as we call them ) r a little out of it. its mostly the guys during P. E . How many people do u know that go around sniffing other guys to "test " how tough they r. I really wish i were exaggerating in saying so. and another thing. why would anyone go up to people saying: wat .......u want to spank me dontcha.. yeah u know u do. just like watt i did to jo mama last evening." it was bad enough that they didnt have the guts to insult me directly. But if ur gonna talk wannabe street, at least have the decency to end ur sentences like that. wat idiot goes around saying " last evening" how disgusting is that. then they all say ' yo lets go jack off each other" i really hope they dont know what jack-off each other means. if they do ...im afraid off wat will happen to America's future if they're it. I have plenty more things to say about these kids, but I'm not sure most of u are ready to hear this, yet.

       so yeah, i was walking to class and what did i see? some 6th graders making out....eeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww!!!!! how grosse is that. people were staring too   i think one oof the teachers was watching. wats more, they didnt do crap about it. i know this is the time our horomones burst out in a rage of....... anyway, wat im trying to say is, that girl could have done way better than that. i mean who wants to see some pimpled-out retainer wearing ass scratcher kids  actually getting some action off each other. and that brings me to my next point, stuff like this just makes us dateless single wonders feel great about ourselves. this is wat lowers our grades because we start to think of how we dont seem to be good enough for anyone.                                          so in short ........11 yr olds getting some is wat lowers our test grades and makes our schools turn to $#!t

       Numb-Linkin Park  I'm tired of being what you want me to be. Feelin so faithless, lost under the surface. I don't know what you're expecting of me. Put under the pressure/ of walking in you're shoes.  (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you. (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)  I've become so numb/I can't feel you there. I've become so tired/so much more aware. I'm becoming this/ all I want to do, Is be more like me/and be less like you.  Can't you see that you're smothering me? Holding too tightly,afraid to lose control. Cus' everything the you want me to be has fallen apart/ right in front of you.  (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you. (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) And every second I waste is more than I can take.  I've become so numb/ I can't feel you there. I've become so tired/so much more aware. I'm becomiung this/all I want to do Is be more like me/and be less like you.  And I know,I may end up failing too. But I know, you were just like me  with someone dissapointed in you.  I've become so numb/I can't feel you there. I've become so tired/so much more aware. I'm becoming this/all I want to do, Is be more like me/and be less like you.

I'm breaking me apart again. You all assume I'm safer in my room.... Unless I try to start again.  I don't want to be the one the battles always choose. Cus'  inside I realise that I'm the one confused. I don't know what's worth fighting for. Or why I have to scream. I dont know why I instigate/ and say what I don't mean. I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright. So I'm breaking The Habit, I'm breaking the habit ,tonight.   Clutching my cure,I tightly lock the door. I try to catch my breath again. I hurt much more than any time before. I have no options left again.   I don't want to be the one the battles always choose. Cus' inside I realise that I'm the one confused. I don't know what's worth fighting for. Or why I have to scream. I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean. I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright. So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaing the habit, tonight.  I'll paint it on the walls. Cus' I'm the one at fault. I'll never fight again. And this is how it ends.   I don't know what's worth fighting for. Or why I have to scream. But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean. I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright. So I'm breaking the habit , tonight

I can't separate  myself from what I've done.  I've given up a part of me, I've let myself become you.  Hearin' you're name the memories come back again. I remember when it started happenin'. I'd see you in every thought I had and then, the thoughts slowly found words attached to them.  and I knew as they escaped away I was commitin' myself to em' and every day I regret sayin' those things/'cuz now I see that I,  took what I hated and made it a part of me.

       Just felt like I had to add to what I posted earlier. I just hope you all actually read the whole thing about which care bear I am before you go thinking I really AM a stoner. As it turned out, my little sis is a thug bear! HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! She's like 8 years old! btw.....I had some really good popeye's food today. I had that mardi gras celebration deal. Which was just like 3 spicy chicken strips w/ fries and a biscuit. I know it doesn't sound like much, but I got really full. I was basically a glutton. I don't care though. I had a good fucking meal and it felt good as I walked home w/ a stomachache. The only bad part about it was the horrible farting afterward. but hey, its a natural thing. So who cares?

       Guess what..................................more 6th grader bashing!!!! That's right! Lets see, where should I start? I guess I should begin today between 1st and 2nd periods. Some kid was showing his peers some journal of his. They began to read it and started to laugh at him. I saw him again during lunch and he was still being taunted. I was sickened and disgusted by that. That little 6th grader had the courage to show his thoughts and feelings at a time when its considered fruity. Those little pieces of shit obviously have no compasion and heart. If you don't care for what someone feels, why laugh? I bet those kids will end up talkin to a psychiatrist about how they have repressed their feelings ever since their friends decided that sharing thoughts was gay. Yet the little kid that individuated from the boundaries his peers set for themeselves will lead a normal life. He will have an easier time talking to others about his problems and if he's smart,better friends than those.   This is a lesson for all to learn from...................................Be brave enough to be yourself. If you're not, we'll all be robots,and robots are boring.

       Man I'm lucky. I'm probably one of only a few guys that can contribute greatly to any conversation between guys or girls. I can talk about girls to guys and vise versa. That seems pretty cool to me. One thing that seems amazing(especially in my school)is that I'm not considered homosexual. I have seen guys talking to girls for a matter of minutes and be placed under suspicion of homosexuality. Yet all they were talking about was a movie. I have spoken about how a girls time of the month can affect a guy, and my friends have even contributed. Though, when those same girls talk to those guys w/out me about that same subject, they start to back away and call each other gay. It's the same thing w/ talking to guys. I'll be talking about what girls are hot and I'm not considered a pig. Many guys talk about stuff like that in detail like I have and were nicknamed"horny dinosaurs" I don't know what I say but I guess I'm good at it. Just hope it keeps up.

       People have really sick minds. You see, the other day, my science teacher was cooking hot dogs with an electric current. He was making like 5 of them so I asked if he would let me have some of his weiner. All of a sudden the entire class was bursting out in laughter. Of course I was the only one who wasn't because I was confused. I didn't even know why they were laughing until someone explained it to me. It's supposed to mean that I want to give him head or something. I tell you, it's a pretty sad day when a man can't go up to another man eating a hot dog and ask for some of his weiner. When did this happen? When did all of these teenagers go completely sick-minded? I don't know. I do know that it has to stop. We shouldn't have to have to watch what we say al the time. Unless of course it's like a racial comment or someone will get their feelings hurt. Also, a few days ago I was watching one of my favorite movies........CRUEL INTENTIONS!!! People were calling me a sicko because there is a lot of sexual content. Yet, the reason I love it is because in the long run, It's a gripping movie that shows how cruel kids can be. So what the hell? If we didn't have sick-minded people i we would be able to watch these movies without being judged.

       I'm gonna go on a rant. I was talkin to a friend of mine earlier on. She said she liked this song by Good Charlotte. Apperantly because it was a very expressive, true song. So I told her that she would probably like Linkin Park. Then she asked what kind of music they played. I said that they played a mix of rock and rap. So she automatically said she wouldn't like them because she thinks rap sucks.  I changed the subject because I knew I would destroy her if we talked about that any longer. But I'm not gonna let that crap stay stuck in my mind anymore. What a load of hypocratic bs is that? first off, how can you judge something you haven't even heard? And second, If you like real, emotional music, how can you not like rap? They express themselves way more than a lot of other people. So once again, I'm left to bag on my friends because of my taste in music, my strong opinions,and their inability to listen.                                                      Ps: i know I ofteh talk about Linkin Park, but they say whats true and I like it.

       Sorry for not blogging lately. But as I said on my last one, I have been a bit burned out. It sort of feels like I am being forced to do more work than I can handle. At least I know that this will help for when I get  into magnet at Cleveland( in case you didn't know, that's a high school) seeing as my brother didn't enter during 9th grade, he was not accustomed to the work load. At least I will be. So I guess feeling bad now will be better than feeling even worse later.

       in the end (remix) - linkin park  it starts with one,  it multiplys till you can taste the sun . burned by the sky you try to take it from. but if it falls there's no place to run ,  crumbling down . it's so unreal.  they're dealing you in to determine you're end, and sending you back again to places you've been. and bending you're will till it breakes you within and still they fill their eyes,   with the twilight  through the skylight and the highlights  on a frame of steel  see the brightness  of you're likeness as i write this   on a pad with the way i feel.  hear the screaming  am i dreaming?  has it seeming that you've played you're part  like you're heartless take apart this  in the darkness but i know that i tried so hard   and got so far,  but in the end it doesnt even matter  i had to fall  to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter  i road down the line and whats there is not what ought to be held back by the battles you fought for me calling me back to be part of their property and now i see that i get no chance.  i get no break fakes and snakes quickley lead to mistakes and as the tightrope within  slowly starts to thin i can only hope that they close their eyes.  with the twilight  throught the skylight and the highlights  on a frame of steel  see the brightness  of you're likeness as i write this   on a pad to the way i feel.  hear the screaming  am i dreaming?  has it seeming that you've played you're part  like you're heartless take apart this  in the darkness but i know that i tried so hard   and got so far,  but in the end it doesnt even matter  i had to fall  to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter

       Have any of the 20 of you ever been stuck in the middle of  friends fighting? Well I for one just hate when that happens. here goes : I met my friend bob (aka robert ) at the beginning of the year . I found out a few months ago that him and my friends (bestest :- D) ave and kaitlyn clash horribly when put together in any situation. So since today was an early dismissal day , during P.E we had a free game day . I checked out a basketball and Bob came to play . We just shot around for a while unlit ave and kitty (kaitlyn) came along and wanted to play as well . So vve were all playing around  for a few minutes when Bob asked to see the ball to try to make a shot. I knew that he could easily get the rebound so I declined. Then kitty ( being a little shorter than my little sister ) wanted the ball. I knew that it would take a while for her to get the rebound so I gave her the ball. All of a sudden Bob got really pissed so he left. I didn't really understand why, but he came back since he still wanted to play w/ david. So then , while ave was taking out the ball (I HAD MADE THE SHOT) Bob was trying to block her . In an attempt to distract her, he brought up the fact that she was still in a fight w/ her ex-best friend . She got pretty pissed so she stopped playing. He kept playing while kitty was comforting her. Afterward , during passing period, I said hi to him and the jackass flipped me off for no reason! Can any of you see a reason for that ........ cus i cant

        The Chico, California, City Council enacted a ban on nuclear weapons, setting a $500 fine for anyone detonating one within city limits.    When two service station attendants in Ionia, Michigan, refused to hand over the cash to an intoxicated robber, the man threatened to call the police. They still refused, so the robber called the police and was arrested.  so who says people aren't stupid?

        The businessman dragged himself home and barely made it to his chair before he dropped exhausted.  His sympathetic wife was right there with a tall cool drink and a comforting word. "My, you look tired," she said. "You must have had a hard day today. What happened to make you so exhausted?"  "It was terrible," her husband said. "The computer broke down and all of us had to do our own thinking."    So after a day of boringness at school , at least  I know I can always turn to my cpu to make me feel better.

       "Eddie: Thanks man...you're one of the greates people i know. good with making me feel better (thats a gift not many people have) thanks for calling bobby off when i was depressed. youre one of the best friends ive ever had. "  You know, you can say what you want about you're whoever you consider a friend, but if they care, they will show it. You can only judge how great their friendship is by how they show it.  I know I have writen dedications to all my friends, but it is a completely different experience when they talk about you. Because when they show how much they care, it doesn't matter to you how they show it. But you only wish that you knew exactly what to say to make THEM feel that way. So then you show how you feel ..............again. And that cycle continues forever. It's only when that happens that you know you have made the greatest friends you could possibly have.        Thanks to ave and kaitlyn for those blogs. I was about to cry when I read them. I hope the cycle continues.

       Some people have started to talk about how they will never be with some of their friends again,seeing as graduation is in a month. That can never be the case with me. I have an incredibly high chance of never seeing some of my best friends again. Yet I will never leave them. We may stay friends and we may not, but I am as big a part of them as they are to me.  Whether they like it or not, each and every one of them has thrown a piece of themselves into the fire that is my heart. They're words will be forever etched into my thoughts and they're names forever engraved in my soul. So here's my final shout outs to my friends whom I can never forget. It may be coming a bit early, but the next month will be filled w/ fun and excitement. I don't want my emotions to get in the way of my good time. So all of you , in whatever you do, good luck and I'll see you L8R!  haress,johnny,roy, and the rest of my crew. - you guys have made my entire experience like a wild roller coaster, you know how much I love roller coasters! No matter how hard it gets, never forget that you guys made a differance , a huge differance, in my life here at sutter and in between.   ave,kaitlyn,and cathy- you guys know , or you should, that each of you are some of the coolest girls I know. Each of you, I say , if you  give as much friendship to all who you meet as you did to me, you can easily make this world a happier, funner, and sweeter place.  to my honors class mates- It was a pleasure to work with you guys and an honor to share you're company.I will miss you all dearly.  to all my teachers(6th - 8th)- You guys were always there to help w/ any problems or concerns I had. You never quit until I was happy. This quality  you posses is only surpassed by my parents. Thank you for being the wonderful people you were to me.  Take these words and hold on, not only to the content, but the feeling you had while reading them. Because in the end, that is all that matters.

       I've been having some thoughts lately. i recently learned that a friend of mine has a slight liking toward me.This seems new to me since no one has ever told me anything like that. But the wierd thing was that while i was taking this online test, one of the problems was to accosiate certain colors w/ a person you know. So when they asked what person you think of when you think of the color white, I said her name. When the test was over the results were as follows: whoever you chose as white is you're solute. I had no idea what this meant. So I looked it up, the definition was : " solute-completeness, solution." So that meant that this person was "my completeness/ what completes me" I thought this was the world's biggest coincidence. For one because she had said that. Also because she had asked who I liked , and I said if I had to pick it might be her. So I really don't know what to think now.                                                                    To that person- I will keep my promise of not telling anyone.                                   To any of my nosie friends- I will not tell you who it is.

       I got to my maximum level of pissed-off ness today. I was eating at Burger King today w/ my parents ( I know how lame that sounds............. but I'll save THAT blog for a later date ) and they started talking about this one ass muncher that lives in our apartment. She used to be my widdle sister's friend, but a year ago she started to hang out w/ some girls that were twice her age ( the ass muncher, not my sis ) . That's where she started to become a walkin $2 slut. By now she is only 8 years old by age. Though I can't say w/ total certainty, she apperantly set crazy glue inside the door knob of a neighbor of our's. No freaking 8 year old brain thinks that up. They stayed outside the rest of the night until about 9 o' clock in freezing cold wind and rain. But the one thing that got me to my breaking point was what she did my little sis  ( nobody messes w/ my family but me ) . Her shitty little friends are always hanging around the center of the building. This is a private area and is literally punishable by law to loiter there if you do not live there. They were finally kicked out of the building a few days ago. So the that little llama rapist threw a tamtrum . This made the manager pissed since she has done this before. What the manager did was to ban all kids of our building from playing down there so they are unable ( or less able ) to fraternise w/ the older girls. Then the manager went to the apartment space of that shitty brat. She wasn't home but her parents were. The manager asked who allowed the girls to even enter the building. ( this is soooo screwed up ) . The parents said my sister was the one who always hung out w/ them. How messed up is that? Now you can see where she gets her assholeness from. They are screwing up their kid. I don't claim to be world's greatest father figure material.........but I know when parents go wrong. But like I said............................you don't mess w/ my family. Cus I'll hunt you down.                   On a lighter note ................... thanx for making me feel special AVE!!!!!  : ]

       So I got to 2nd period. I sat down in my seat and my friend is about ready to cry. So being the councelor of a friend I am, I ask why she's sad. The 1st few times I ask I get no response. After a few attempts, I break through. it turns out she got in a fight w/ her bestest friend. (this gets a bit confusing ) her mom's friend wants her to choose between hanging out w/ her or another group of friends she has. The mom does not like that group for some reason only God can decifer. The rest of that class was just spent getting details on what happened. Next period there is this guy that always bugs her. I knew today would be a bad day for that crap(I know from experience) so I used complex visual aids to show him how bad it would be if he pissed her off. I sit next to her in 4th period, so I noticed she was a little better , these things just make you happy don't they? (being able to see you're friends happier after they've been so down) . Now kids, there is are lessons to be learned from this:                                                               #1- never get people angry when they are already emotionally hurt.                                                                #2- When you don't know how someone feels in a bad situation, the best thing you can do is help out, be attentive,  and             comfort them as best you can. (good lesson for anyone who is bad at counciling friends in need..........ROBERT.)

       I don't know what to think of today. It started off really bad, the rest of the day was okay though. A trend has started at my school. Guys keep pinching the nipples of other guys. I could swear they have fetishes or something. It didn't get much better because I had to go through my third day of the CAT6 test. I finished early(as always) so I fell asleep for a few minutes(try 2 hours of sleep in class). This is where it started to get good. It turns out the teacher, as well as everyone else, thought I was dead. They kept poking me and screaming at me, but I just wouldn't get up. I scared them alll when I woke up. Afterward I played some basketball and won. This shoked me so much because I am incredibly bad at the game. It got even better when I went to eat at Carl's Jr. I don't know why, but it just felt really good to sit down and eat there. The day is now ending. I'm watching the original X-Men movie. So I guess that's pretty good. I think I'll go to sleep now. L8R!

       Lying From You-Linkin Park  When I pretend everything is what I want it to be. I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see. When I pretend i can forget about the criminal I am. Stealing second after second just 'cus I know I can but.....  I can't pretend this is the way it will stay I'm just  Trying to bend the truth. I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm Lying my way from you.  (no, no turning back now) I wanna be pushed aside so let me go. (no, no turning back now) Let me take back my life,I'd rather be all alone. (no turning back now) Anywhere on my own, 'cus I can see. The very worst part of you is me.  I remember what they taught to me. Remember condesending talk of who I ought to be. Remember listening to all of that and this again. So I pretended up a person that was fittin' in.  And now you think this person really is me so I'm  trying to bend the truth. But the more I push the more I'm pulling away so I'm Lying my way from you.  (no, no turning back now) I wanna be pushed aside so let me go. (no ,no turnng back now) Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone. (no turning back now) Anywhere on my own cuz I can see. The very worst part of you is me.  This isn't what I wanted to be. I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me, like this.

       Hit the Floor-Linkin Park  There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me. Wonderin' what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy. Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away. Afraid to say what's on my mind,afraid to say what I need to say.  Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around. You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep puttin' me down. But I've had too many stand offs with you,and it's about as much as I can stand. So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine.  One minute you're on top. The next you're not, watch it drop. Makin' you're heart stop. Just before you hit the floor. One minute you're on top. The next you're not,missed you're shot. Makin' you're heart stop. You think you won, and then it's all gone.  So many people like me put so much trust in all you're lies. So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside. So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long. All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on.  There are so many things you say that make me feel you've crossed the line. What goes up will surely fall and I'm counting down the time. Cus I've had so many stand off's with you  and it's about as much as I can stand so I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine.  One minute you're on top. The next you're not, watch it drop. makin' you're heart stop. Just before you hit the floor. One minute you're on top. The next you're not, missed you're shot. Makin you're heart stop. You think you won, and then it's all gone. And then it's all gone. And then it's all gone. Now it's all gone.  I know I'll never trust a single thing you say. You knew you're lies would divide us but you lied anyway. Now all the lies have got you floating up above us all. But what goes up has got to fall.  One minute you're on top. Next you're not, watch it drop. Makin yyou're heart stop. Just before you hit the floor. One minute you're on top. Next you're not, missed you're shot. Makin' you're heart stop. You think you won. And then it's all gone. And then it's all gone. And then it's all gone. And then it's all gone. Now it's all gone.

       Wow ....... I don't know why, but lately I've been happy. Really happy. Really , Really happy. No .... not in that way, but emotionally. My spirtits have been very high, I have been really optimistic. Just little stuff like that, but it makes an incredible difference on how people see you , as I have noticed. My confidence has risen greatly. I wish I knew what was making me feel like this .......... but who cares as long as I am right ?  well ..... L8R people ... :-D

       well ....... today sucked majorly. the plan was for me, johnny, shirley, kelly, and sum other gurl ii dunno to go watch charlie's angels. So when me and johnny got there ( he gave e the ride over there ) they were waiting at the disney store for us. then they said " we'll be right back " so we waited about 15 minutes for them to return. when they finally did we asked where they had gone.  they told us two that they went to go look for guys. . . . .excuse me? not only does that make a guy feel inadeqate, but what a stupid reason to go off and basically just ditch us.  well, me and johnny ( being the forgiving guys we are ) let it go. we hadnt even mentioned how we felt about that so we could still have a nice day. so then they say . . . . oh, we'll be back in a minute. welll, once again , we had been stood up. this time we decided not to stay. we went to borders and i picked up the album by staind. IT KICKS ASS!! well ..... it ended up being just me and johnny watchin the movie...it was a kewl movie but it would been kewler if that crap hadnt happened. then , as the movie ended, we saw them again. i at least asked for a hug b4 they left....shirley was about to, but hen that ass that i didnt know just pulled her away.... then i felt really bad.... and now im REALLY pissed at all 3 of them. i mean, they invoited us, why ditch us? wasnt the point of that to spend time w/ us? how messed up can ppl be?

       many of you seem to be confused as to how you add a comment . what you do is go to the bottom of each post of mine. there  should be something that says " talk you " or  " spoken " . click oon that. it will ask you for you're e - mail adress , you're name ( you can make it up ) and you're blog site ( dont worry about it if you don't have one. ) then you go to the lil box under that . this is where you type you're comment(s).  then you click send or enter or something that will post you're comment.

FUDGECICLES!  )  walked back home to chat w/ the same borin ppl (srry to all of u ppl i talked to earlier, but u tend to get borin when  it's summer and theres nuthin to do .... and ur too gutless to take the bus to some place ur dying to go to when ur parents cant take you )  #3 - finally things brigtened up around 4 pm. i finallly found sth to watch on tv. more fun ppl came online. i had TKD.  the master keeps complimenting me. he might advance me by a few belts b/c im doin so damn good. hehe.   #4 - get back home. find that i have  an over load of messages i hadnt tended to seeing as i wasnt there to respond. however..... the 15 ppl that left messages had left within 5 minutes b/c their so damn impatient. now im here typing this blog. tellin u bout my day. * wat an original ending!* lets see if i can come up with something a little more fun to read tommorow

       well, its that time of the year again  .. . . ..summer vacation. sorry if im not too enthusiastic about it, but im pretty depressed( though not as much as these past few days ) and second, summer just isnt as fun as it used to be. they took off a lot of my favorite summer shows.... now all i can watch is blue's clues and bob the builder. at least until about 2 pm. well .......... while i was w/ kaitlyn , ave , and cathy at the mall on thursday, i picked up the greatest card ever. these quotes will make all of our summers ( as well as our lives ) a lot happier and stress free :   #1 - my soul's had enough chicken soup . . . I WANT CHOCOLATE!   #2 - remember , a bad hair day is a good hat day  #3 - life is short , buy the shoes  #4 - staying in shape is tough . . . unlless the shape is round, round is easy!   #5 - life has it's ups , life has it's dips. . . at least we have potato chips!   #6 - reach for the stars .. .. .. it will keep you're chest from sagging

       wow, if this isnt depression i dont know wat is. u c , ma friend kaitlyn gave me a picture frame with a pic of me, her, ave , and cathy in it.Its really sad cus i know things wont be like that anymore. Im gonna miss those times a lot now. cus a part of the group is gone. . . . . . . a part of US is gone. and its not the school that we miss, we can always visit it again, it's the people that made that school so much better. i think u all know who i mean in particular. or at least most of you do. lets c wat i got for graduation : a cd player ( thank you mommy and daddy!) and $50 from ma aunt and uncle. thank you guys too. you think id b happy but im not. not to sound unappreciative,  but id rather just have a time  machine if its alright with you

       yesterday wuz the dance ( notice how i talk about it before and after but never ON the actual day ) i had fun at a dance for once! wierd. but yeah ,  lets see .......... the first few songs were pretty lame, mostly manufactured pop ( eeeeeeewwwwww ) * squirms * ,  once we all heard something good EVERYONE came up , with the exception  of ma bestest fwiends shirley and diana cus they were bein mean and didn't wanna dance w/ me! well pooperz on them cus i had fun w/ out them . i think it was the 6th or so song   ( in the end - linkin park ) when i started to have some fun. I'm not sure if anyone has noticed, but I am a pretty avid LP fanatic as i began to sing out loud, everyone crowded around me and THAT really kicked ass. for the next few songs it was pretty calm around the whole place. that is, until the final 2 songs came around, as the DJ anounced that " these are going to be you're last songs for you're 8th grade year, make em good."  with that saidthe whole place went up in tears * sigh*as we went into the last slow dance .... i was approched by several of my close gurlfriendzz , they were apperantly looking for a shoulder to cry on ........ so there i was with about 10 gurls cryin around me as i tried my best to comfort them all. the end of the dance wwas pretty crappy. we did get this kewl pin that says " class of sutter 03' " so i guess that was kewl. Im gonna wear it on my graduation dress * lollz* . but yeah ...... ima wear it , so at least i can say that i once had school spirit. well , im going to go sob and cry and be depressed now ................

Are you gonna waste you're time thinkin  how you growed up , or how you missed out?"  so i guess what I'm tryin to say by writing this is that ........ don't waste time on going for what you want. shoot for it, if you don't get it, you know now instead of wondering.  and take life and live it to the fullest. it wnt kill you to live a little. And besides, it's too short to not do anything with.

       Ok children, it's time to gather 'round the camp fire while I tell you of a tale. A tale of pain, misery, angst, and dispair. (kids shout) "yaaaaaaay!"   It all started today around 6. I was all set to visit Ave for the last time until December. Well if this were a pretty story, I'd be tellin you that I got there and had a great time, a few laughs, and plenty of new friends. well it's nothing like that at all, as you might have guessed. As it turns out, our van broke down on the way there. We had gotten more than half way there, and our cell phone had been stolen while my brother was at orientation for UCR. This was the whole family by the way. Me, my mom, my dad, my sis and my bro. So of course, as we were WALKING home (10 miles or so) my dad and Lj took turns carrying her. Luckily by nightfall my dad had called a friend of ours to pick us up around devonshire and reseda. This I would say is the mid way point between our breakdown and home. while we awaited our pickup, mommy was entertaining us w/ memories and storylines from one of their favorite spanish soap operas.  The whole way I was thinking to myself  " Damnit, the last thing I said to her face to face was I'll be MORE angry if i dont get to go " hehe. Lots of good that would do. I wouldn't want my parents thinking it was their fault I was angry. they would think that too. and then I would get yelled at for thinking that. even if i told them I was only pissed cus i couldn't go. We got home around 9pm. The time i was supposed to get picked up from the party. coinkidink? Once in I speedily went over to check messages. thankfully ave had left a message w/ the phone number to where she was. So i called and i explained what Ive been explaining to you people so far. Her mom even offered to pick me up to go to the party, but I might not have had a ride back. All that's left to do now is stuff my face w/ mexican food.    On the up side though (lil kids ask " there's and upside?") I know *shockshock*. I made a few realisations along the way home.   - #1 : I am the poster child for emo.  - #2 : I am the poster child for OLd Navy and Levi's as well. - #3 : walking long distances w/ you're family is a great way to build up stress ( especially if you're older bro and younger sis are REALLY annoying along the way. - #4 : shopping carts make for great relief when carrying a nagging sister and uncomfortable materials (for example : sandals, shirt, gatorade bottles) - #5 : people always seem to know how you feel, even if their wrong.

But it sucks cus its my last time i get to see ave until december :'(. But hey, I can be kewl w/ that, cus it's not like she never comin back right?

       Wow, this has been one of the best day's I've ever had. To start it off, me and my brother Lj had to go to the doctor to get him a physical. we were left there by our daddy since he had to go to work. I must also inform you all that this hospital is in van nuys. Only a few miles from our house. Well afterward we decided to stop beeing fat ( he didn't like how much they weighed him as ) so we set out to find a place to eat....walking. I know i make it sound bad but I happen to like walking. Several restaurants passed us by beore we reached the taco bell I was dreaming of. It had been months since I've eaten taco bell food. I had this disgustingly delicious quesadilla and some hard shell tacos. What made it even better was that i won a free taco! So just when I thought things couldn't get better, Lj decides to give me a tour of cleveland ( my future High School ). I was a lil amased at how small the school was in comparison w/ what i had in mind. It was still awesome though. When that was over it was time to head home. On the ay things started to get pretty quiet ( between me and Lj ) so I told him a few stories of the hyjinx I've been through w/ my friends, I pointed out where a few of my friends lived, and told him who's going to what school. It was kewl just to be able to reminice on those things. We arrived home, and to my surprise, I wasn't tired! *shock shock* . When we got there there was a guy who was cleaning the carpet. HOORAY ........... CLEAN CARPET!. It might not be AS kewl as the other stuff, but none the less, still one of today's highlights. Well the fun didn't stop there. Yesterday I had rented  "007 agent under fire". I love this game.  Though until today I had been stuck on a hard ass level. Who wants to guess what happened. That's right....I got passed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not only that, but I won the entire game!!! I even went on to get more bonuses for the multiplayer mode! I've already told you about the last part ( N64 :-D ) There was a lil crap in between.... but I won't get into it for the sake of not ruining my mood.  Well .... I'll be back tomorrow hopefully with more happy news. L8R!

           for those of you who dont know, our ( me and ma bro ) 's N64 had been lent to his best friend peter. Well the 2 of them got in a fight and I haven't seen it since. It has been about since may of last year since I've seen our beloved N64. . . . . :'(.

       U2 - beautiful day   The heart is a bloom Shoots up through the stony ground There's no room No space to rent in this town   You're out of luck And the reason that you had to care The traffic is stuck And you're not moving anywhere   You thought you'd found a friend To take you out of this place Someone you could lend a hand In return for grace   It's a beautiful day Sky falls, you feel like It's a beautiful day Don't let it get away   You're on the road But you've got no destination You're in the mud In the maze of her imagination   You love this town Even if that doesn't ring true You've been all over And it's been all over you   It's a beautiful day Don't let it get away It's a beautiful day   Touch me Take me to that other place Teach me I know I'm not a hopeless case   See the world in green and blue See China right in front of you See the canyons broken by cloud See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out See the Bedouin fires at night See the oil fields at first light And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth After the flood all the colors came out   It was a beautiful day Don't let it get away Beautiful day   Touch me Take me to that other place Reach me I know I'm not a hopeless case   What you don't have you don't need it now What you don't know you can feel it somehow What you don't have you don't need it now Don't need it now Was a beautiful day

       Tae Kwon Do was soooooo much fun today! At first it was gonna be a normal day, seeing as we were getting our asses kicked through excersize and streaching ( the splits = ....PAAAAAAAAAAAAIN!!!!!!!!). then the master surprised us by having the class split up into 2 groups of 6. We had to do ..... *drum roll please* ..... KOREAN WRESTLING!!!!!!! What made it even better was that I had to face my sister. A little bit of an uneven match,  but still cool. for those of you who need a little insight as to how that works, what korean wrestling basically is is 2 people hold on to each others belts and try to take down one another.  So after my team won, the other team had to carry us around the dojo. I felt really sorry for the poor kid that had to carry me, but oh well. L8R people.

       price to pay - staind  We failed to see, How destructive we can be. Taking without giving back, Till the damage can be seen, Can you see? Can you see?  The more you take, The more you blame, But everything still feels the same. The more you hurt, The more you scream, The price you pay to play the game, Then all you see, And all you gain, And all you step on with no shame, There are no rules, No one to blame, The price to play the game.  Apathy, the chosen way to be, Blindly look the other way, While you waste away with me, Can you see? Can you see?  The more you take, The more you blame, But everything still feels the same. The more you hurt, The more you scream, The price you pay to play the game, Then all you see, And all you gain, And all you step on with no shame, There are no rules, No one to blame, The price to play the game.  What you pay to play the game, What you pay to play the game, What you pay to play the game, WHAT YOU PAY TO PLAY THE GAME!  The more you take, The more you blame, But everything still feels the same. The more you hurt, The more you scream, The price you pay to play the game, Then all you see, And all you gain, And all you step on with no shame, There are no rules, No one to blame, The price to play the game.

       so has anyone seen the lyrics I've put up n the side column of my blog? Well if you ever need somethin to read and I havn't posted, yo can catch a glimpse of a few songs. Which I will add to and change frequently, seeing as it's easier to posrt lyrics than ideas and thoughts for me. And instead of putting them in blog form (which can sometimes get annoying) I'd rather have them on the side. Blah. Well anywho, seeing as I know our new teachers ill start off the school year by asking "how was you're summer break?" or "what did you do over the vacation?" I figure I'll get a head start.   This has been my most active summer. Which is pretty sad seeing as I hardly went out with friends at all. The kick off to the whole thing would have to be the best part. It all started about a few weeks into summer. I had already gone out to the movies with Johnny and told him about a lot of crap. A few days afte that I started bouncin off the walls since I could finally tell people I had a gurlfriend and  not be lying to them. A month after vacation started Ave came back from Polluck pines for a visit. Me, her and Kaitlyn went to sherman oaks castle park along with my lil sis. I'd say that was one of the best days I had all break. I went to the movies a few times. I got to see finding nemo, pirates of the caribeen, charlie's angels, tomb raider, I think there's some more. I had a few adventures along the way. right after graduation me, ave, kaitlyn, and cathy all went to the mall. We stuck around a while, bought useless crap, ate pretzels, and in the end said good bye for a while. It was about 1 pm and I was gonna meet haress, roy, johnny, chris, and a few other people to watch bruce almighty. As it turned out they were gonna meet there at 12 and i thought they said 1. I ended up walking home from the mall. which wasn't all bad cus i got some nachos from 7-11, and i like walking.......... even if it was about a mile or so. My next excursion came a month later. I was gonna meet ave and her friend to see finding nemo. I decided to take the bus. Only the damn thing took a freakin long time. I was about ready to run passed nordhoff when it finally came. What I didn't know was that the bus turned on nordhoff, leaving me to quickly get off and run to the theatre place. I bought my ticket hoping to meet the 2 of them inside. Though to my surprise (or i guess you could say i had a heart attack) they were actually in line next to me. At the end of the movie Ave's mom offered me a ride home but i decided to stay a bit longer and take the bus home. I also wanted to play crazy taxi high roller. Well The bus pisssed me off so once again i ended up walking home. Not quite as far  as walking from the mall, but tiring none the less. I didn't get to see as many of my friends as I had planned. I saw mostly my cleveland people. Let's make a list shall we? there was ave, kaitlyn, cathy, kelley, johnny, jose, roy, jason, david, juan, jose (another one), gary, aaron, umm ....... i think I'm missing a few. If I am im sorry, but my brain isn't exactly at 100% right now. There were other high notes as well. My brother and I finally got our 64 back! I've been having fun creating a few of my friends as wrestlers. Yeah I know you're gettin pissed (at least a  few of you) but it's for my entertainment, not yours. I got xp installed on my computer. yay! My computer has sound now as well. Tae kwon do's been keepin me busy and a lil more fit. and I think that's pretty much it. Of course there were rough patches along the way, but why focus on them? Well anywho, I know it's been hard reading this all so I guess I'll stop now. L8R.

       Wow, if only you knew what has been going on lately. Then again, that's what this blog's for right? lol.  Well where to start? How about with my computer. About a week ago a friend of our family took away my computer to get a few things fixed. Namely my virus scan and umm ...... well I thought that was it. I had gotten it back the following Friday, though it came at a price. All of my files (pictures, written files, ALL OF MY DOWNLOADS!) all gone..... :( I'm still trying to get everything back. The only thing I really need now is my window washer. Which leads to my next ..... umm .... thing ... to umm ... talk about i guess. I downloaded McAfee VirusScan 6.0 pro edition. It was right on time too. About an hour after I got it I was attacked by a virus. It would've been easy to get rid of except for the fact that I couldn't find out how to get rid of it permanently. I'm guessing it's a new one but I don't give a sh*t either way as long as it dies! Ugh! Well, on to more happier stuff!   Yesterday was freshman orientation.  It was okay. I saw a few of my friends. That was kewl. Even thoguh I only got 1 hug out of the whole group. Thank ya megan ... even though I doubt you read this. Well I would've gotten my picture but the line was endless and they hadn't even opened the doors yet. I did get my locker though. Which is kewl cus it's in the same hall as johnny. YAY! :-D We got picked up by my brother's friend enza to go out to eat at del taco. Pretty kewl I'd say. After that we headed to Fry's to check out some speakers for my computer. I happy now that I finally have audio! So I guess I can get myself some Mp3's now! You wouldn't believe how happy this makes me. Since I got my computer I havn't been able to hear what it sounds like. Well after Fry's we headed to best buy to find some cd-r's. It was so awesome how we ended up buying a mouse bad for me. After our excursion there we headed off for a drive. I have no idea where we were at anytime but you know what? I didnt care at all. It was just awesome to go around and listen to a conversation. I liked just listening to my brother and enza saying random stuff. Well after that thay dropped me home and the 2 of them headed to do crap. I stayed home installing my speakers. I fell asleep. Probably the best part of the day. It's been such a long time since I've taken a daytime nap.  Now today we went out to hometown buffet. I guess my parents were feeling bad that we couldn't do anything nice for either me or my brother's birthdays. We stole like 6 snickerdoodle cookies. Those are sooooooo disgustingly good! Now were home. Now my brother's friends enza and minjung are here screaming at the TV. We're alternating between watching the food network and the desilu story, and i think some japanese soap opera. so awesome. : ) That's pretty much it for now. I'll ttyl. L8R!

       wow. I'm really hurt right now. Apperantly Kaitlyn doesn't concider me a friend anymore. Hey, you may not be hurt about loosing a friend but I sure as fuck am. Whatever happened to being friends huh? Just cus I made a few remarks about you're blog and how stupidly cynical it was (this was only 1 post by the way, the others were ok to me) doesn;t mean you have to overreact and stop thinkin of me as a friend. At least Cathy took it ok. She still thinks of me as a friend (i hope) Honestly, what the fuck did i do that talkin to me about it wouldn't have helped? so if you make new friends and you talk about them am i gonna stop talkin to you? well, too late for that. Cus I'm not gonna give a shit how many friends you have that arent me. cus im just not that fucking insecure.

       I've been finding that a few of my friends are acting stupidly emo, or wannabe emo, however you wanna put it. Sayin crap like " what's the meaning of life...... NOTHING" don't gimme that shit. Life's only worth what you make it out to be. That is to say, if you have a bad outlook on things, you're gonna focus on the negatives of shit. So look up and have fun. Find yourself something that makes you happy and get rid of this shit like " why do things people expect you to do if life is pointless" i don't wanna hear it. I bet if you come to me and tell me you're the sadest person alive or you're in the worst situation..... i WILL prove you wrong.  I'm gonna take something i heard from a friend a while back. "no one knows how i feel! i fight with my mom all the time and they  don't give a shit bout me!" you know what.... if they didnt care they wouldnt even have you in their home. Ive talked with them and you know they care. As for no one knoewing how you feel, there are  millions of people who can REALLY say they're parents don't care. If i keep getting these stupid useless blogs I think I'm gonna take em off my links. because i know that people use my links and i donn't want others to get depresssed for no reason because of you guys. also they can get pissed of cus they have worse situations and they can even start laughin at you for sounding so stupid. so anymore of these crappy posts and i  WILL take you off my links, favorites and maybe even block you.  and if you have any stupid fucking reason to be pissed of about this, why not talk to me about it instead of getting childish and warning me because you don't wanna admit you're stupidity.

       sorry for not blogging lately. I've mostly been caught up in editing and adding things to my blog. The 2 most noticable things are probably the auto cursor i have for this place and the games you can play (found at the very bottom of the page).  I would also like to ask that any of my readers plese leave comments. that way if you don't blog, I ( as well as others) can still have somethig to read. 1 more thing before i leave,  the countdown to my birthday is on! 4 days!

       shit, such major shit. i need pep pills, jus something to get my sprits up. I could keep goin on like this  but it'd be better if i gave you a lil background on why i feel like shit.   around 5 or so i got a call from ave askin if i could go to hometown buffet.  Of course i HAD to go since it would be my last chance to see her till december.  It was so kewl. I got to meet her friend's franny and divina... ( i hope i spelled that right ) . they were kewl, i had fun until the ride back home, thats when i realised ave was crying. i don't know how i held my tears in but i somehow did. when we got to my house we got out and i jus couldn't bring myself to let go of her. i think that's about when my waterworks turned on. as they all got back in the car I walked up to the front door of my apartment and stood there waving goodbye until i could no longer see the car. well, I got to thinkin after that and realised.......... its only 4 months. but then i told myself.... wait...... thats 24 weeks... 168days!!!!!!! so i basically made myself feel worse. Im gona miss you sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!! :'( i keep thinking im gonna see you at school...... then i remember im not goin back to 8th grade.. im movin forward.......... that sounds so final doesn't it? you do realise i have no point right?? LOL! jus remember that when ur down u can always call me. send me pics too cus i nno wanna miss a minute of u growin an movin on w/out me.  I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! buhbye FOR NOW!

         You're Most Like The Season Spring ...  Fresh faced, with a young outlook on life - you smile at the world and expect it to smile back at you. You're mostly a bubbly, fun - innocent person. Described as cute possibly. However, you're a little naive about things and tend to be a little too trustworthy. As the first season, It Makes you the youngest - and so most immature - but people are inclined to look out for and protect you.  Well done... You're the most fun of the seasons :)    urlLink   ??

       1 more thing today. I just read Kaitlyn's blog ......... what's all this shit about Ave hurting US. she hasn't hurt ME ...... even though the dumping was a lil bad.... but thats not the point. Don't pin your shit on more people than yourself, if YOU feel bad ... then say that! She hasn't done anything to piss ME off, or you for that  matter, and don't think I'm not involved cus thanks to you I am. Anyway I already explained to you why she don't call you back. Need me to refresh your mind? How's this: you make her feel guilty for being happy every once in a while. Things aren't as great up there as you would think. She calls the people that make her happy. It just so happens that I'm one of those people (thankfully). Anyway you seem pretty happy most of the time that I see you. So why not act the way you feel? At least that way you won't confuse people. That might go for you too Ave. This is the last time I will look at Kaitlyn's blog cus I took her off my links. Now to all of you who are involved : I'm sick of all this bullshit melodrama! Shut the fuck up i you have nuthing good to say. If you can't fucking shut your mouth then try to see the other person's point of view. Stop being so damn universalistic (core term!) Your side may not be the best to see things from. Anyway, if you wanna comment thats kewl, just don't go putting it in your blogs(KAITLYN) that is .... if you want me to actually read it. Cus when you said (y not say it to my face?) just think about it and fllow your own advice. L8R people.

       I don't think it's been too long since I've blogged do you? Didn't think so. lemme start with yesterday. The plan was for me, kaitlyn, Roy, and jenny to go bowling. So after school I met up with kaitlyn (my ride) and Cathy. We walked over to where her dad was. Along the way though I heard this really loud honk from a car.... It was cathy's dad. I honestly think he hates me. Kaitlyn too for that matter. Cathy's parents are WAY too over protective. After gradation me, Ave, kaitlyn and Cathy decided to go to the mall...... And cathy's mom tagged along! I feel so sorry for her :( its okay .... They'll learn soon enough Cathy.  Well after that we found kaitlyn's dad (he's awesome, probably the only dad of one of my gurlfriends that likes me ..... If that came out wrong then who cares) We all talked about John Ritter on the way over there. It sucks that their making a comedy about his death. Well once we got there me and kaitlyn went to the air hockey, but before we got there ..... We found my dad. I got really scared. He just dropped by to ask me some stuff( don't ask) Well anywho after he left and after winning at air hockey we ordered some fries. During which time Roy arrived. It was kewl, he needs to shave though. A few minutes after he got there jenny came. YAY!

       I would like to share an essay I was assigned in AR which I just turned in today. Once I got going it became so refreshingly inspirational.   My Beliefs:                     "I believe we are born in order to experience the many feelings and ideas the world has to offer. Like the great friends who cradle me with love, and the not so great ones who taught me that the down times they threw at me could only be followed by ups once they were gone. I believe we all set our own purpose for life. Mine personally would be to achieve a state of complete happiness, if for at least one moment. We should all do good for the sake of keeping peace . . . why cause pain and chaos? We die because at one point or another . . . our hearts stop, either from old age or some other reason. This may not be the most spiritual way of looking at death, but Im not quite that spiritual.   God to me is a force which according to Christianity, created Heaven and Earth. Her (thats right, her) role is to watch over us and track our sins and good deeds so she can argue a good case for whether or not we get into Heaven. God to me is like one of those really strict but fair teachers that you dislike when you first meet them, but grow to appreciate over time. She gives me a sense of security, something we all should feel.   I believe we all have souls, otherwise it would make soul mates impossible. Your soul goes wherever it pleases after death if you find your soul mate. If you dont find it your soul continues the search after death. It is my belief that one can not be judged alone. If you deserve to go to hell your punishment is to have that person erased from your memory, and to never be able to in them while you continue your search for them. Concerning angels, they are the people around you everyday who make your life a complete. They may also be known to some as friends and family. I wont completely rule out the existence of ghosts. Just as I wont automatically disagree that there is a Santa Claus. There are some things so strange that they might be real.   It may not have been too clear in the last paragraph, but I believe we all subconsciously search for our soul mates. It is a natural thing, we want to be happy, and love gives us that feeling of confusion, overwhelming grief, and happiness we cant live without. Music is my guiding light; it speaks the feelings I cant describe in a way that is pleasant and understandable. Art has a strange way of making us want to twist it and turn it until it holds meaning for us. A big orange circle may cry out emergency to one, while whispering relaxation to another. Of course, I hope no one is taking these things to heart. These are MY convictions, I am only expressing them, not persuading you to think and believe them.   I got to think a while ago about what I would someday want my wedding to be like. It should take place before God (anywhere basically). The people who take part are of course the couple and anyone the wish to observe the ceremony. I think the only one who would lead is the person marrying the two. Though the main focus is one the couple. What happens is that the two people exchange and share how they feel toward each other. Its a time when you know exactly what you think but can never say it to come out as great as it feels in your heart. No objects or symbols are needed, though for some reason people like to use rings, I never quite understood that. I once heard that some people believe there is a nerve in your ring finger that leads directly to the heart. I like the ay that sounds so Ill try the ring thing too.   It felt great to rite this essay. I discovered tat I am a bit of a romantic..... whoda thunk it! My favorite part was creating my symbol. The basic shape is that of a cross. Not necessarily because I am Christian. It will make more sense as I explain further. Stare into the horizontal part of my symbol. Notice how when you first look at it, it seems complete. Focus on the sides a bit more and you notice that its not quite complete. It still has room to be filled in. You can see two little spaces in the middle. One side is love, the other is hate. The love side is more open and easier to approach. The other is more intimidating and harder to get into. Both spaces can be either full, empty, or in between depending on my mood. Right now it is well balanced as seen by the top and bottom of my symbol. The middle an open and close depending on my mood, I feel a bit balanced in my mood between judgmental, disappointed, and happiness. The balance is imperfect and therefore neither are the yin-yang signs. The rounded cross-like figures at the top and bottom represent my emo (emotional) levels. The top means I am happy wit something because of something simple (sleep after a few nights of having to stay up late, a compliment from someone, things of that nature). The bottom is happiness due to love (for family, friends, etc.) The scale can be the same for an emotion; I just used happiness as an example. As for the lyrics, in paragraph five, I said music helps me say what I feel when I dont know ho to say it. Those lyrics represent what I felt at the particular moment I thought of my symbol, not necessarily because of the symbol. I hope my symbol is thought of as not only a symbol, but art, and as such is represented differently by different people."    Believe it or not, that was nothing compared to the whole thing! I figured with the other stuff I'm gonna type it'll make this post a lot longer. Feel free to spit out any comments, disagreements, and remarks you have toward my work, I an stand a bit of contructive critisism. Or any objections regarding what some may concider blasphemous statments. No on to more of my verbal release.  Today in marine bio, me and aaron   On to another thing, i was thinkin about how some people like to find meaning in art, music in particular. I was shooting ou songs in my head and thinking of what they mean to me. I got "id do anything" by simple plan stuck in my head. Automatically I was thinkin about ave. Hees a few lyrics so you can have a better understanding of where im comin from:   Another day is going by. I'm thinkin about you all the time, but you're out there, and I'm here waitin. And I wrote this letter in my head cus so many things were left unsaid. but now you're gone and i can't think streight.......Id do anythin, just to hold you in my arms, to try to make you laugh cus somehow i can't put you in the past. Id do anything, just to fall asleep with you. will you remember me? cus I know I wont forget you."   as most of you know, she was forced to move to the middle of nowhere. I miss you sooooooo much! :( luv ya! :-D. wow, ive filtered a LOT, Id bettter save my wrists fo another day. L8R.

       Ok, I know I said I wouldn't, but I got kinda bored so I took a peak at Kaitlyn's blog. Is it just me, or for the last 10-15 posts as she been at least mentioning the fight between me, her, and Ave? I personally don't want to make any comments about that, if only or the sake of sparing myself a word fight (cus we know that's as far as it'll get). I'll let my readers post comments on this shit if they want, but I don't really care.  Today was the 1st day that I had to wear my ROTC uniform.  It wasn't as big a deal as I thought it would be, though that thing was really HOT! And the pants seem a bit short. I have a few essays due tomorrow and Wednesday... Looks like I'll be stayin up late for a few more nights :( I won't complain though. I luv the stuff we're learning.  Lj came home for the weekend, it was great to see that slut again:-P   If i think of more crap to talk about I'll post again. L8R for now.

       Hedwig and the angry inch - Tear Me Down  Don't you know me Kansas City, I'm the new Berlin wall Try and tear me down.  I was born on the other side of a town ripped in two I made it over the great divide now I'm coming for you  Enemies and adversaries they try and tear me down You want me, baby, I dare you Try and tear me down  I rose from off of the doctor's slab like Lazarus from the pit Now everyone wants to take a stab and decorate me with blood graffiti and spit  Enemies and adversaries they try and tear me down You want me, baby, I dare you Try and tear me down.  On August 13th, 1961, a wall was erected down the middle of the city of Berlin. The world was divided by a cold war and the Berlin Wall was the most hated symbol of that divide Reviled. Graffitied. Spit upon. We thought the wall would stand forever, and now that it's gone, we don't know who we are anymore. Ladies and Gentlemen, Hedwig is like that wall, standing before you in the divide between East and West, Slavery and Freedom, Man and Woman, Top and Bottom. And you can try to tear her down, but before you do, you must remember one thing.  Hey.  There ain't much of a difference between a bridge and a wall Without me right in the middle, babe you would be nothing at all.  Enemies and adversaries they try and tear me down You want me, baby, I dare you try and tear me down.  Enemies and adversaries they try and tear me down You want me, baby, I dare you try and tear me down  From East Berlin to Junction City Hello New York hello Missouri  What you try and tear me down come on and tear come on and tear me down.

       Today was pretty sweet. We were all gonna got o the doctor (my family) and it turns out our doctor wasnt there so we left. We headed to work w/ my dad for a while and chilled @ in n out for lunch. Got to bond w/ mommy for a while which isnt something we normally get to do. Went to thrift ...... excuse me ... RITE AID , to pick up a few random thingies. I got myself this clearasil acne wash thingy which is also gonna help me exfoliate! wo0t! Thank ya kyan! btw . watch queer eye tuedays @ 10 on bravo! Once home my dad fixed up a few snacks and we all settled down to watch kill bill again. Such an awesome movie! Now Lj's gone off w/ friends to whore around the valley. I'm left here in the room listenin to these 1099 mp3's he gave me.   i began to listen to "the boys of summer" by the ataris. I wanted to look up the lyrics cus i aint sure bout all of em. I got to bout the 2nd verse and i was like "hey this remeinds me of sum'n" .... beffore i go on lemme show ya what it says so we can understand eachother a lil bit better:   I never will forget those nights I wonder if it was a dream Remember how you made me crazy? Remember how I made you scream Now I don't understand what happened to our love But babe, I'm gonna get you back I'm gonna show you what I'm made of  I can see you- Your brown skin shinin' in the sun I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys of summer have gone  Out on the road today, I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac A little voice Inside my head said, "Don't look back. You can never look back." I thought I knew what love was What did I know? Those days are gone forever I should just let them go but-     Well it's probably obvious to a few ppl by now. ive had Ave on my mind a lot more than usual lately and .... well... i dunno.  while listening to lyrics i usually picture some kind of story in my head. All that was flashing was the end of the party where last i saw her. "I'm gonna show you what I'm made of" .... hmm, that could imply a lot of things. Don't immediatly assume what all you horny lil kids probably think when u 1st hear that. Anywho, the whole "when i get you back part" im jus sayin to myself ... " jus 20 something more days ... 20 something days..." Then comes the  "don't look back..." thing. To tell the truth i kinda agree. you can't look back to escape what you feel NOW. I say apply what was to what is so you can look back by moving forward, cus or else you get stuck in a rut and you won't feel better. but thatas jus me.   ONE MORE THING! seeing as there's only about 24 hours left anyways...... i wanna wisha  happy happy birthday to haress!!!! I WUV YA MAN! your school choice was wrong cus ur makin us miss you way too damn much man! us cleveland babies want ya here w/ us! oh man we're lame. but hey, happy birthday man. MANY MORE! :-D L8R

       Once again, sorry i havnt blogged. Jus havnt had too much to blog about. plus the whole lazyness shat. Happy thanksgiving to everyone reading this, and to whoever's not. I'm thankful for a lot of stuff and people, but you guys should know who you are by now. Yes even you kaitlyn...... though I doubt you read this anymore. Please people don'ty give me shit about how I'm supposed to hate her right now. Truth be told I never hated Kaitlyn, jus that a friendship between us doesn't usually last over 3 months or so. Why be hurt 4 times a year right? But hey..... thanx for the good times!   yesterday i had roy, jose and johnny come over to play vice city and true crime. Aaron was scheduled to come but his mom had to work and he had no ride. We miss you =[. Lj came home last night too which felt awesome. Wuv ya =].   right now im sick. Jus a minor cold. Mommy's workin on dinner. Ima go help her out right now.  I'm watchin space jam :P Woah.... I can remember watchin this movie over and over when it came out on video. When my brother came in the room he'd be wonderin how the hell i could watch this thing. Then when he found it playing on VH1 earlier he said " hey vain ... " I turned around to see the screen. at first i thought ... eeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww. then i was like " ok hold on.... why did i let his opinion take over mine?" I realise i still love this movie. I dunno, i guess i was tryin to act older by usin Lj as an example and emulating him. And now that i feel a bit of shame for not bein myself, i can be thankful that i chose such a great example =].

       ahh, much to talk about these past few days. I finally got time to actually sit down and type it all out. I guess I'll go kinda random on the whole shit, so here we go:  yesterday was AWESOME-  Me, Johnny, Diana, Yen, Shirley, Kelly, Aliccia (excuse me if ispelled that wrong), and a few other people went to watch scary movie 3 yesterday afternoon. The movie wasn't n't go for the movie anyway ;-). I havn't seen most of these people in months, it just felt great.   bonding :) - Me and Johnny felt a LITTLE bit ignored when we got there. The thing is, we were only a few feet away from the group, and it took them about a half hour to notice us :-p. I can not begin to say how good it felt to be around all my pplz. The thing is, right off the bat I was like "woah ........ what am i doing around all these cute gurls?" ya know? I noticed that I become a completely different person when I'm w/ a lot of gurls as opposed to a group of guys. I get a lot more laughs too which is pretty kewl. Anywho, on to the sub-title topic. I think the person I bonded w/ most was yen. The thing is, we went to elementary school together, and when sutter came along, we jus didnt talk. We (me, her, johnny) went up to the furniture area of JC Penny and sat down to just talk. We told stories and talked about stuff. At least until we got kicked out. Afterward, johnny gave me a few people's screen names. I got to talk a bit with Kelly which was kewl cus we hit it off pretty well when we started talkin. When we were waiting for shirley and kelly to arrive some people came up to us with a camera and asked for a short interview. Me and Aliccia were the only one's willing enough to go for it so that was pretty kewl. During the movie i got to sit w/ diana which was awesome, by the end of it I was practically sleeping on her lap :-p.  Good times :).  chats- I had some good chat sessions w/ a few people. With Lisa we were jus catchin up on stuff, she wouldn't believe me when I told her she was cute but she knows she is. I especially enjoyed my talk with lynda. lisa had asked about my love life, and seeing as i wasnt talking about much with lynda, I asked her that question. apperantly she doesn't want a relatoionship because they bring too much drama. Not to disagree, because I know they sometimes do. However she neglected  the joy and happyness relationships bring. I know you've gone through a bit of crap but don't let one bad experience keep you out of the game.  I asked about her best guyfriend and she told me bout him.... too bad i dont remember much about what she said about him. Then she asked me to choose my best gurlfriend. WOAH waaaaaaaaaaaay to hard a question, she's already heard about Ave so I had to say someone else. I just picked out of random and said Diana (not to devalue you at all diana, wuv ya   Alright more into my wuv life. As most of you people should know by now, I not only like 1 gurl, but 3. Its sucks so much :-p. It jus gets confusing.  Ave, Angleica, Diana...... do you guys have to be so awesome?   school's been kewl lately. I just got my grades and I improved a bit. we took the IUE on monday, it wasn't as bad as i thoguht it would be. I really love my 5th period. its right after core so i gots stuff to talk about. i gots gary and aaron and mary and sarah and kelley and a lots of other people. they all rock. speakin of kelley thoguh, ok, that is my wuv right there. you're awesome kelley :), wuv ya!   umm, thats pretty much it. Im just watchin a queer eye marathon right now. Ill post later....... L8R!

       Umm, I just went on a walk to get myself some comfort foods. I thought that was what I needed you know? but on the way the wind started blowing really hard. I wanted to grab someone for a hug and i realised there was no one with me. I know in my mind I was thinkin of ave ..... you know what..... those 4 hours or so DO NOT make up for months of separation. theres such a big gap right now that i won't be able to close for a while. It doesn't help at all that i have the IUE comin up. I'm also watchin the end of the 1st pokemon movie ..... it's so depressing, wtvr ....... ithink ill go to sleep now r sth ...... L8R

       My heart felt condolences go out to the famiy of Michael Lockwood who lost him yesterday. For my fellow WWE fans, you may remember Michael as Crash Holly. You guys remember how I could do the "crash face" so perfectly before puberty? I loved that guy (sorry for the past tense). I rememberthe 3rd time I  went to a WWE event.  I had a poster of me and him with a sign saying "separated at birth". He saw it and came out of his car just to sign it. At the time I was just speechless. Now I wish I would've told him something... anything! I feel horrible right now. And being 3:45 in the fucking morning ain't helpin :(

I've been able to build character out of it all. like ..... in the beginning or 8th grade.. ...how could i have known that anyone could make you look forward and anxious to go to school..... or anywhere for that matter. i couldnt know that i was a nice catch(and im quotin a few of my gurlfriends so dont think im conceited) hell i was an insecure lil bizzatch around that time. now its like ... well...... things have changed for the better. :).  something else i can say now thanks to this year. women are one trouble we cant get enough of. kinda like drugs:-p except it's a lot harder to quit this drug once you're hooked. well maybe i'm saying that prematurly. i still have a few years coming hopefully. lets see how ive progressed this time next year.   theres some people i  feel i should apologize to. bobby... im sorry life thrust me between you and ave.  you were pretty awesome as far as i got to know though i dont claim to know you. kaitlyn, im sorry we cant be friends ...... im sorry you cant chill out and relax so we can be friends. im sorry for anyone i forgot to include. as soon as i remember you ill be sure to give you your due.   ive discovered the magic of thought and self discovery. i hope you all remember my 12-1 post..... you know...... the 7pg write up that led to my short lived go-go blog. well that did it. gotta thank aaron now for sparkin that. ever since i wrote that ive had a none stop thought fest. it sparked my critical thinking which is still going on right now. or am i jus forcing myself subconcsiously to do it for the sake of keeping it up......... see what i mean?   way too many people to thank. however i have a few that stand out and deserve special recognition. ave, thank you for sparking the 1st few paragraphs of this post. Wuv ya!   ive come to learn that anger is a wasted emotion. it leads nowhere. give me peace happyness and love any time:-D \m/   i have one more person to apologize to...... ave ...... im sorry we cant ring in the new year together...... i miss you and im sorry that its so damn hard to get over you. but thanks to you i realise that ..... emo comes in all varieties..... you helped and are still helpin me feelin me the best one of em:)   damn i have AMAZING friends. nathen, roy, kelley, liz........ :) you you guys know what i mean :) im sorry i only just now told ya guys that.   you know what? im sick of lookin for things to be appreciative for. have an awesome new year everybody! and screw this "good luck in the new year"  shit. cus if you believe enough in yourself.... you wont need it :)

       delayed post from 12-21:  been reading love rules by Marylin Reynolds. this book is really awesome so far. Its creepy how i can relate to the main character. At least the way she thinks anyway. We both wander aimlessly in our heads linking one thought to another until we somehow end up back where we started. its so awesome.   ave came back today. why didnt i seem as happy about it as i thought i would? im growing up acccordin to my bro. guess he's right. dunno. could be. im through questioning what the fuck it means though. if it had deeper meaning id probably care more.   net's down.. been listenin to winamp5 a lot. i got this MMD3 skin my bro recommended. winamp 5 is so amazing. you can burn cds on it now and like... the added more visualization effects. its also got internet tv and internet radio on the free version which is insane! \m/. ill be usin it often now  all this time devoted to .......sorry. listenin to easier to run right now. Jus got to one of my vaforite verses of all time. "jus washing it aside. all of the helplessness inside. pretending i dont feel misplaced is so much simpler than change" somethin about hearin that jus makes me stop what im doin and ....... bask in its .....sowie again, jus got to faint, damnit. this song's awesome. all LP is. UGH! so much emotion is put into this music......... its like a fucking tornado of passion and angst! makes ya think those kiddies had terrible childhoods. "id see you in every thought i had and then the thoughts slowly found words attached to them and i knew as the escaped away i was commitin myself to em and everyday i regret say those things cus now i see that i took what i hated and made it a part of me." why cant i help thinkin of ave when i fucking listen........ type........ that? more importantly.... why cant i believe im thinkin about her when those lyrics come up? "ive let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you! giving up a part of me ive let myself become you!"  Lj says i should save angst for later ..... like i core... you know? wtvr.... jus ..... wtvr. dont see why i should hold back what i think i feel jus cus he thinks certain things should come at certain times.... jus like the fucking giver. never did like that damn utopia concept. maybe cus i think the worlds so screwed up already that the concept of a utopia seems impossible w/in the next millenia or two.   andrew wondered why I listen to people like vitaly who " try to change the world" ill group myself along w/ him for the sake of this rant. we dont try to change the fucking world. the act is you cant change it. being aware of its imperfections is the next best thing though. once i explained that to him he said" yeah exactly" wtf? dont give me that shit like you think you know. if you did you woulda told me upfront. or maybe i dont know you as well as i think and you wouldntve said it upfront like i thought u wouldve. assumption- a statement accepted as truth without proof.   "things arent the way they were before. you wouldnt even recognise me anymore. not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end." winamp 5 ......... i cannot imagine my life without you... i ask your hand in holy matrimony "you're a fucking gold digger! you only want my music! you dont love me!" - damn right......... the music's the most important thing.   once again....... in the last lyrics i typed in...... i was thinkin bout ave....fuck this man. i was fucking right in my 12-1 blog post. or maybe i choose to link everything to her cus i havnt grown up... or maybe i have grown up and thats how im supposed to do things - hypocrisy- the professing of beliefs or virtues one does not possess.   "i wanna be pushed aside so let me go. let me take back my life id rather be all alone. anywhere on my own cus i can see the very worst part of you is me." - lying from you, yet another awesome song ....... damnit! i derno....... now i feel emotionless..... lookin for something meaningful to type..... or maybe ive already said what i have to say ....... grrrr...... teenager-of, for , or involving those within the ages of 13 and 19....... the definition doesnt give the word justice.  "all of this stress gave me somthin to write on, the pain gave me something i could set my sites on." - thats better.   am i really qualified to give teenager a definition? its only my second year here and i still gots shit to go through. or maybe im already mentally old enough. mature-fully grown or developed.   "im tired of being what you want me to be. feeling so faithless. lost under the surface. i dont know what you're expecting of me. put under the pressure of walking in your shoes." grrr- ....... GRRR!!  how long is this post gonna be? .......... wtvr ..... not like i gots more of a writting limit than whatever my wrist can take. -numb- unable to feel or move normally  "'less i hear the less you say... you'll find that out anyway." I FINALLY GET IT!   we're only on the L's ladies and gentlemen! wait till we reach the s's. "part of me wont go away, everyday reminded how much i hate it. weighed it against the consequences. cant live without it so its senseless. wanna cut it outta my soul and jus live w/ a gaping hole. take control of my life and wash out all the burned taste. i made the problems in the first place. hang my head low cus its part of me.you hardly see right next to the heart of me .... now im sick of this i cant stand the sandpaper thoughts that grade on my sanity. id rather not even be than be the man thats starin in the mirror through me." angst- a feeling of anxiety...... havnt been usin the right word have i?   daria sure is amazing the 2nd time around. like lots of things we take on prematurely. oh sure you get the hang of it ....... but you miss so much. am i really talkin bout a cartoon anymore. guess not, seein as i was thinkin bout kiddie dating. such a terrible concept. gotta let em come to that conclusion on their own though .... hypocrate- see paragraph 8  "i wanna heal, i wanna feel, what i thought was never real. i wanna let go of the pain ive felt so long. (erase all the pain till its gone) i wanna heal. i wanna feel, like im close to something real, i wanna find something i wanted all along."- optimism- a tendancy to expect the best possible outcome or dwell on the most hopeful  aspects of a situation.    "i woke up in a dream today, to the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor. forgot all about yesterday remembering im pretending to be who im not anymore. a little taste of hypocracy and im left in the wake of the mistake , slow to react .so even though you're so close to me ur still so distant and i cant bring you back" -pessimism- a tendancy to have the gloomiest possible view of a situation, the doctrine or belief that the evil in the world outweighs the good.  im priceless :)  delayed post from 12-22  "its like the mist is what's pretty you know? the gold and silver?" "Mmm hmm" "too bad it cant stay like that all the time" "nothing gold can stay"  "have i waited too long? have i found that someone? have i waited too long .... to see you?"  "The needle on my record player has been wearing thin. this record has been playing since the day you've been with him .....Remember the time we wrote our names u on the wall? remember the time we realised thriller was our favorite song?"  - hit or miss  " so can you see? You're seeing less of me darling. And you're blind to the fact that my heart stopped beating. - sincerily me  "I can't remember the time or place or what you were wearing its unclear about how we met all i know it was the best conversation that i ever had  to this day ive never found someone with eyes as wide as yours ive been searching up and down this coast overlooking what i need the most  did you notice i was afraid? i thought id run out of things to say. two more hours until tonight burns this away and it starts all over again  the sky will never look the same again till you show me how it could be the sky will never look the same again until you show me how it could be  and everything else is irrelevent to the story so far" -the story so far  "Living with me i dont think it would be so bad. This is the first time this year that im not goin to make you mad. Im tired of my conscience always tellin me to stop sleepin. But i cant waste a second on trends that will never begin.

       MENTOR (Submissive Extrovert Abstract Thinker )   hypersloth  Like just 6% of the population you are a MENTOR (SEAT). Some would call you the most powerful and influential of all people. Those people are wrong.   The reality is that you DON'T really WANT to impose personal views or beliefs on others. Yet you are extroverted and intelligent, and you like to get involved. So you help others with the pursuit of knowledge.   You're the reason that people say "teachers are also students." You are as much a learner as a master, and this satisfies you.   You won't die a lonely death, but towards the end you'll grow introspective, wondering if your life meant anything. This will last for decades, and you'll die after your spouse.

       sorry for now bloggin lately. been busy thinkin. havnt put much into my go-go-blog either. bleh. here's what you guys havnt read thats in there:   12-8: ive been meaning to post this for a while. it should help a few of you guys put some of ur self-inflicted shit into perspective  new radicals - you only get what you give  But when the night is falling  and you cannot find the light  If you feel your dream is dying  Hold tight  You've got the music in you  Don't let go  You've got the music in you  One dance left  This world is gonna pull through  Don't give up  You've got a reason to live  Can't forget you only get what you give   This whole damn world can fall apart  You'll be ok follow your heart  You're in harms way  I'm right behind  Now say youre mine   Health insurance rip off lying FDA big bankers buying  Fake computer crashes dining  Cloning while they're multiplying  Fashion mag shoots  with the aid of 8 dust brothers Beck, Hanson  Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson  You're all fakes  Run to your mansions  Come around  We'll kick your ass in!   well..... the last 2 might not mean much.... i just felt like puttin em in. :-p.   "goodnight, the truth has come out that everyone's needy. White teeth, a ticket to meet God and be all that you envy." - Our Lady Peace  12-11 : Oh man I feel really good right now. I was jus layin down next to Aubrey lookin @ the clouds... it was sooooooo peaceful :) I never took the time to notice before but if you look @ the clouds for a while they start to moove .. you can even feel the Earth move if you take the time to relax... good times :)  Thats pretty much it for what i have written so far. Gary thinks I'm a born writter. He's like addicted to reading it. A lot of people have told me that my writting is awesome. i don't think Ill give that up as a career choice anytime soon. But i jus gotta remember that the writting is the important thing. If i lose that ........ well..... its like when a musician gets caught up in the autographs and money and fame and all that.... and they forget that the music is the most important thing...... its kinda like that. Oh man, sitting in my room, listening to music, writtin what im feelin ......  i feel exactly how i do when Im sittin on the grass w/ my pplz @ lunch and nutrition, or during 5th period. This is such a sexy feeling..... honestly if whatever im feeling were human i would do things to it i wouldnt possibly be able to imagine.

That face represented how i felt when I made it.... wonder what wouldve happened if i changed how i felt in the past?  I'm listening to "somewhere I belong" right now. I REALLY want to scream like that. Too bad my parents and sis are asleep. It's so hard to listen to it and not want to scream along.Those screams carry such emotion that it feels lke you're just holding something in and it hurts to bottle it up.  BlueKisses55:My boyfriends lives in Illinois BlueKisses55:But we talk to eachother everyday hypersloth13:that's kewl BlueKisses55:its cool hypersloth13:wow, I know so many people who have their boyfriends and girlfriends far away BlueKisses55:oh hypersloth13:people who have em close by don't appreciate that [as far as ive seen]  BlueKisses55:yeah I know BlueKisses55:they don't know what it feels like hypersloth13:it gets to hurt ... a lot BlueKisses55:yeah BlueKisses55:but pain only makes you stronger hypersloth13:time works too slowly to heal those wounds though Blue Kisses55:ah but what is time but something that goes by slowly and yet there never seems to be enough of it hypersloth13: :) BlueKisses55: :)  I was talkin to Lj, he helped me put this whole Lynda thing into perspective:  Hypersloth13:admiration's the line, sometimes you feel a step over it and sometimes you feel a step behind.

       This whole thing i wrote yesterday kicked ass. I felt great the whole day! From now on ima post a lot about what gets written in there. I'll jus call it my gurl on the go blog :-P W/ that spirit in mind, here's excerpts from today:   Oh man. Like, the day after I wrote this whole sh@t I started talkin to Aubrey. She such a philosophy whore :) Damn she's awesome! :) LIFE ROCKS!   Yesterday I went for a hug from Sara, and like ... she backed off. I dunno, Felt a lil bad. like I did something wrong. I don't think I made her uncomfortable... But that still coulda been it. I asked why and she said There was no reason for it. She wasn't looking @ me while she told me though.... so I can't believe her. I don't Think I'll ask for hugs from her anymore... it jus made me think I make her feel bad or wierd of something. I'll jus be getting more from others :)    There's so much I forget to write about ... I mean TYPE into my blog. Good thing I'm writing all this sh@t down :)

       The following is something i wrote out on paper about an hour ago. it has somehow changed me. I feel the need to post it. I shall change NONE of what it originally said. :) -  PG 1  Aaron rocks. Jus had a short but meaningful convo on the phone w/him. Talkin is such therapy. We got to share a lot of stuff. We have so much sh@t in common. I shared ... we shared our girl troubles. I probably won't be able to share it with more than like 2 people and have it feel close to the same. I wanted to include Ave in that list.... I kind of felt obligated to. I guess cus we're sort of growin apart... we experiencing things away from each other. I should stop expecting that she's gonna be able to help me through a lot of things. In 8th grade it wouldntve been a problem because she was close by and we had more of the same experiences.   I was also talkin to kaitlyn as i talked to aaron. I realised she's nice to talk to. I'm afraid it's only  in small doses.nutes since the last  PG 2   sentence, I think there are two reasons for that. It would be ........ Just feel like i HAVE TO  stay not talking to her. After all I said and fought with her for, I made the decision to never talk to her and keep her out of my life as much as i could. How sad. I let my own expectation of myself keep me down. That led me to my 2nd reason.....ave. I'm jus afraid she's gonna despise me for it. I know what you think about her ave. I feel you're acting out of blind hurt and you're stuck in the rut i was in. Then again... kaitlyn is pretty closed-minded too. You guys hurt eachother way too much and your stubbornness will keep you guys from ever letting go of the hate you think you feel.   Ave is becoming such a part of my life. Seemingly unrelated things involve her after I   PG 3   disect those situations and thoughts. Just cus of the love I have for her I feel have to talk to her [online] But ive come to find that we don't have much fun often unless it's on the phone like we did earlier [today]. When i told myself i liked Angelica its like ..... she's really boring online. you know what? We hardly share any laughs or good talks at all. It's that feeling of obligation again. Once i told myself I liked her its like I wanted to keep that ........ make that true. Same thing w/ diana. screw that! I don't like them in that way. I let a little infatuation seem like more than that. The only person I think I really like is lynda. (im talkin bout ppl other thatn ave right now) So this sucks cus she's 4 years older than me. Hell she told me it wouldn't work, cus apperantly  PG 4   she likes me too. Amazing how age makes all the difference in how you see people and how you interact with them. I feel like me and her broke at least a few of those barriers. But i still feel like i'm treated as younger than her. Thats sad. Its just sad that i feel i cant change that. whats kewl though is that I proved that you can like someone purely by personality. Lynda has never seen me and I am one of her best friends. To quote her "It's too bad you're 4 years too young." Though while i say that I picture her face showing sarcasm. That tells me that you can never tell someone you love them anywhere but face to face. Ave ....... i can't believe your words until I hear them in your presence.   I hope nothing I say devalues what I think of you. I really do love you. But I can't give  PG 5   Those words meaning unless I tell you while locking eyes. Only 20 or 19 days left for me to be able to prove my words :) I can't really FEEL like I  love you unless  I have you near ...... I can only KNOW I do.                                               Coldplay - The Scientist  "Questions of science, science and progress / do not speak as loud as / my heart"  They said it better than I ever could. My brain isn't the part of me connected to you....... my heart is. My brain can only acknowledge that.   You know? This whole write up Sparked after talking to just ONE person. I want to thank you aaron. Thanks to you I have so much put into perspective. Another one of my lil philosphies comes up (althought I'm sure someone thought of it by now) "everything you say and do   PG 6   affects everyone around you. Your very existance has the power to shape the existance of all those on earth." We're all mystically linked to one another. This is an awesome power.                                             "with great power comes great responsibility" A quote from Peter Parker's uncle in Spider-man. If this is corny, then corn me up. It's what I believe to be truth.  I'm reminded of a conversation w/ lynda i had last night/this morning. I was talking abotu ......... she asked "shouldn't you be doing homework?" We were having an amazing chat. I replied "I'd rather lose my sleep talking to my friends than having work as my #1 priority and losingmy sanity"                                              Our Lady Peace - Happiness and the Fish "Talking is just   PG 7   masturbating without the mess." once again, someone already said it best.   this felt great. Lets do it again real soon :)

       "One day a little boy wanted to know about politics so he asked his dad.His dad said "Okay son, say that Im the economy, your mom is the government, youre the people, your nanny is the working class, and your little brother is the future.Now think about that and go to bed."  That night, the boy's little brother started crying because he pooped in his diaper. Not wanting to wake his mother, he peeked through the keyhole in his nanny's room and finds that his dad is screwing her.  The next morning, the boy says to his dad, "I think I understand politics now."  And his dad says, "Okay son, why don't you tell me in your own words about politics." And the little boy said, "The economy is screwing the working class,while the government is sleeping.The people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit."

       You seem to be trying to sweep aside the situations (and maybe the people) that you feel are standing in your way. You are impulsive and apt to follow these impulses seeking to be involved in special or exciting happenings. In this way you hope to deaden the intensity of your conflicts, but your impulsive behavior is leading you to take some unnecessary risks. Back down a little and remember 'more haste - less speed'.  You are very self-sufficient and methodical. You presume to know where you are going but need to find a person who will recognize the way you are, not be too demanding and who is, as they say in Italy, 'Simpatico'.  You give the impression that you are a self-sufficient individual, pretending that you are stoical - indifferent to pain or pleasure. But this is not so, for in truth you are an extremely emotional person, one that may make hasty decisions and perhaps repent at leisure. It is time now perhaps to break the bond of detachment and become the real 'you' - the you that you would like to be.  Setback after setback has resulted in considerable stress and now you have got to the stage where you are continuously on your guard, not only to protect yourself from others but to protect yourself from yourself. It would seem that many of your unfulfilled hopes and dreams have led to uncertainty and suspicion. You no longer wish to answer to others and you are insisting on freedom of thought. You feel that you are fully self-sufficient and can control your own destiny. You are seeking ways to protect yourself from further loss of prestige and against further setbacks. You have become very dependent and you doubt that matters could possibly get any better in the immediate future and this negative attitude is leading you to exaggerate your claims and to refuse reasonable compromise.  You don't like authority and you rebel against all forms of limitation. You are your own person and you intend to stay that way and to get on in the world simply by your hard work and determination.   compare results at www.colorgenics.com

       *the following has been written by some good ppl @ gatorGSA, keep in mind that these are intended as JOKES .... NOT statements against gay marriage, cus i totally support same-sex marriage   12 reasons same-sex marriage should never be allowed:   1) Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control are not natural.   2) Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people cannot get legally married because the world needs more children.   3) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children because straight parents only raise straight children.   4) Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears's 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.   5) Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and it hasn't changed at all: women are property, Blacks can't marry Whites, and divorce is illegal.   6) Gay marriage should be decided by the people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of minorities.   7) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are always imposed on the entire country. That's why we only have one religion in America.   8) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people makes you tall.   9) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage license.   10) Children can never succeed without both male and female role models at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.   11) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer lifespans.   12) Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages will for gays & lesbians.

       well.... back on the single's scene. No biggie I guess. I guess i have some pluses comin at me. I get to focus on my studies more. probably wont go out as much (a derivative of #1). I don't have to worry as much about my scent =P   What's there to talk about right now? umm ... I guess i could go on a rant about ..... i dern even know what anymore.  I wanted to blog a while ago about stuff, but I got lazy. That's gettin to be a problem lately. I fear that I'm gettin less than sufficiant grades. I need to dedicate a weekend to just workin out how I'm going to get myself organized n stuff. and to all my friends who read this blog..... that means goin out less....... WAY less. not that I go out more than twice a month but .... eh. How's this for a schedule :            1) no more goin out until my grades improve. The most I'll allow is once or twice a month.                      2) seeing as I usually get about $5/ day for school. This amounts to about $100/ month. So if from now on I only use 1 of those dollars per day, I get $80/ month.... give or take a few.             3) From now on... no more TV until 10 pm. I get home around 4, and take an hour or so for eating and settling down. So I get 5 hours for homework before I get to watch TV. Speaking of homework ...             4) I will do as much of it as possible @ school. This mean's less talking during class, even during free time.             5) If I should happen to fall short of these self-inflicted restrictions, I ask anyone who has read this to punish me ..... to keep me on the ball.   well enough of that. My back and shoulder's hurt, so Ima haul ass outta hurr and go listen to the TV. L8 =)

Water's sexy like that aint it? Holy Jebus if only i had a bit less amount of work to do. It would make it so much easier to jus kick back and let it all run through me. It was rainin on the walk home too. I was listenin to no doubt ..... then i hear a clash of thunder and it starts to pour and ........ wooooooooaaaah. Such awesome shat. I shouldve added more incubus to that CD. Bleh.  we'll have to leave that till next time.

       From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:  What makes 100%?  What does it mean to give MORE than 100%?  Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?  We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over  100%.  How about achieving 103%?  Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:  If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26, then:  H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  and, K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%  But, A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%  And, B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T 21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%  and, look how far ass kissing will take you: A-S-S--K-I-S-S-I-N-G 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%  So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that:  While Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, Bullshit and Ass Kissing will put you over the top!

       Saturday was awesome. I went to the mall w/ Haress & Johnny, saw Jersey Girl, walked a lot. Good times. You guys rock \m/.   Been feeling a bit ineffable lately. I don't think it's a bad thing, but then again, I don't know what   it  is.   I want .... Whoa, I forgot what I was gonna say. That's what I get for lettin myself get distracted by TV. Bluh, if it's important or significant I guess it'll come back to me.   I have no homework for today, besides outlining. This rocks!  I   need   CD's.... I've been compiling songs to put into it. I jus derno what to put into it. I'm also trying to figure out if there's some kind of theme that goes along w/ them. They seem a bit ...uh .. non-similar.   I've been thinkin, using song lyrics as posts is a bit annoying to me. However, I understand, as well I hope others do, that (at least when   I   do it) it's done for personal reasons, not for the enjoyment for others. So, in that spirit, here's some stuff from Dashboard Confessional...    Dashboard Confessional   - Living In Your Letters  "...There is no need to test my heart, with useless space. These roads go on forever And there will always be a place  For you in my heart  So I'll hit the pavement  it's gotta be better than waiting & pushing you far away cause I'm scared. So I'll take my chances & head on my way up there. Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten."  I'm out ppl. L8.

       Must ... ramble...... a lot.  I gots a lot to think bout ...... or maybe its jus something out of nothing. Ill figure it out soon enough.   I wanna go out, not in a group ...... or a huge  group anyway. 4 people at most. Theres only one person I really wanna see right now. But seein as I gots to wait a week or 2 to see her,  Ill be gettin my @$$ outta this house w/ Johnny & Haress.  I WOULD go out w/ the people I mentioned in my last post, but I wanna have a chance to talk. . . . not to be rude or mean to you guys, but I talk a lil more deeply w/ Johnny and Haress, and I need that right now.    School's been ......umm ...... i derno what. Im not quite jaded, I jus thought of everything way too much, so it kinda got to me. Im disserpointed in CORE right now. Jus some of my classmates. Im stuck in the middle of a storm of Asian people in Irilian's class. I don't mind being ignored.... but I don't learn from my mistakes ... so I keep trying to engage in conversations, when after the 1st billion times it's been blatently obvious that Im not really being let in.   Oh man, I jus saw queer eye. This guy jus messed up the dinner he was makin for his gf, the dog peed on the floor befor eshe got there, and he forgot how to iron his shirt. He was trying soooooo hard. I felt so bad for him. Then when she got there she wouldnt really cut him a break. She complained a widdle bout the food. Then he tried to give her a massage and she was being all immatre about it. He tried so hard, and she wouldnt cut the boy a break. I woulda so slapped that biotch. She was so annoying. Damn, I wuv this show  :-p  Grr.... I gots nothin to say, I know I have stuff to thinkabout ..... but I can't put anything into words. Ill go read my new Marilyn Reynolds book now. L8.

       Jebus Christ, am I tired. I havn't slept a good school night in about a month. Im done w/ staying after school for a while. Monday Ima be promoted to a corporal in ROTC. Not too bad I guess. Might as well do my best while I stay in the program. I have an IUE a week from Friday. We havn't even finished going through the unit yet .... but I guess they can't penalise US for that, can they?   I havn't gone out socially for about a month. Not kewl. Now Im bein invited to the movies on Saturday w/ Roy, Coco, and Kelley, (maybe Aaron), and I have no idea who else. It'd be so great if I could go, but Ima either be stuck @ home workin or goin to the library to do research for one of my Marine Bio projects w/ Alex.   Ave's comin back soon :) I jus keep thinkin to myself .. . . the sooner I finish my major school shizzle ..... the sooner I get to see her. You know what? It's been working! Ive been turning in all my stuff on time ....... even if i DO lose my regular amounts  of sleep. well ..... we gots 3 months or so of school left. I can grin an bare this crud for jus a widdle bit more. Woah.... 3 months... seems like jus last week I was @ orientation. How time flies....

       woooooah. amazing past few days. Ill start with the beginning i guess.   on friday, I forgot that we got out of school early, so that was a bit of a treat. We were dismissed @ about 12:20, so it shouldve been about 1 when I got home. The thing is, I also forgot that the house was gonna be fumigated. On the little notice paper they left, it said we could re-enter the house @ 4:10. I had nothing to do for 3 hours so I headed off to sutter to visit people. When I got there I  sat in Ms. Walsh's class for a while. then I chilled w/ Mr. Coombe, and off to Mr. Hanley... well I got bored so I went back to Ms. Walsh's class and graded papers :-p. I stayed for like half an hour after school. By the time I left it was 3:30, so i had 40 minutes to whore around the valley. I decided to head over to Roy's place. We played Vice City till he headed off somewhere w/ his dad. From there I went to Jose's house, went online for a few minutes, then called daddy to pick me up. all in all, a good day :).   Today was  pretty sexy too. Woke up @ 8 as we preped to pick up my slut. It was about 11 when we left. I gots to say, that car ride was fun. I was listening to some Hoobastank stuff on the way as the wind whipped my hair around wildly. We got to UCerr at abut 1 or so. Ate some Jack In The Box along the way. Tons of fun :).   Got my hair cut a few hours ago. Now I'm eatin some cups 'o noodles and watchin tv. Besides the homework this weekend's gonna be amazing overall. Im out. L8err.

We each started makin small talk  (.....small talk sucks) so I started talkin bout what was goin on last night. I had this awesome time on the phone with Roy and Mel. It was only about 10 or so, and I still had some work to do for english. None the less, I was really sleepy. I derno, must be something in the air thats been makin me wanna sleep early. It aint jus me, Ive been talking to teachers and friends about this. Most of them have been havin the same thing goin on. Its pretty trippy. I had this theory that it had something to do with the alignment of the planets ......... but thats cwazy talk. Bleh, can't dismiss it though.   Cant wait till spring break.

       jus told off some LJ   user. not that  I expect any kind of change in her thinking, but it felt good to tell her off as best I could. The whole post was basically ranting bout stereotypical bloggers. for example: the gurls who always have a terrible day, people who post "ugly" pictures of themeselves, people who type about their day. You know, what most of us do. Some lame ass attempt at showing her superiority.  Then to cap it off with saying she's joking. I dont know to believe that or not. However, y not say that IN THE POST! instead of waiting for someone to shut em up.... i mean..... if they ARE just joking.   enough of that. Todays been pretty awesome. 'cept enetation is down, so if someoen wants to post comments they can go to my guestbook. Oh, and while Im on the subject of comments... Please be aware that you only have to click the comment button ONCE after you finish your post. people impatiently click it a lot when the new post may not show until you refresh the window. This caused 14 comments to show in my last post, when it couldve just been about 5. Not that Im mad at all, I enjoy that people are commenting so keep it comin.   lemme get back to my original subject. Today was kewl. Didnt really do much at school. Jus hung out w/ friends mostly. Speakin of which, Alex ..... WUV YA! that goes to all the rest of my peeps as well. heh... peeps:-p Well, where was i? Got home, started workin on the objectives for Lowe's class. I CAN'T BELIEVE I FINISHED! *clap clap* Now gettin to work on geometry. woah.... did anyone know that you can actually finish all your homework if oyu dont watch tv or go online while your doing it? wish i woulda listened to that before. But bleh. Im out. L8.

       well its offiical... I miss Ave ... a lot more than I think I ever could have. Damnit ... last night it took me until about 2 hours after I got in bed to actually fall asleep. I can't stop thinkin bout the gurl ..... :-\ Im jus so damn happy she's comin back soon. Oh, seein as Becky and some chick named Tina have no idea what I meant by "#16" ... refer to her blog (if ya can) ..... the survey thing.   seriously, I feel like a mushy lil whore. It's gettin harder and harder to stay focused on shit, and I can't help but wonder how you are, what you're doing ... and if you miss me as much as I miss you. The only thing I think about as much is how Id love to in Aaron's shoes.   So what's the word for people like me right now? ..... smitten? Oooooh boy... damn teen years. And I'm just gettin started.

       woah, Im watchin whose line ........ RICHARD SIMMONS ROCKS! ooooooh boy.  funny shizzle :-p   well I should be doin HW right now but uh ....... yeah. and y does it look like someone left a comment on my last post? I clicked on it and I dont see anything. bleh, if someone DID leave a commment please do it again cus I wanna read. Holy Jebus. Might be goin out this weekend, but I aint too sure, I aint actually sure i wanna go. I kinda wish I hung out with more gurls. Most of the guys I hang out with dont really like to make conversation ...... or at least we can't think of a good topic. I remember in 8th grade, me, Ave, Cathy and Kaitlyn would actually make conversation ...... I miss that. but well, it'll take a while to get that back. The only one of them I have a chance of talkin to is Cathy, unless I wanna risk Kaitlyn goin bi-polar on me. Or maybe its not the conversation stuff as much as me gettin sick of guys after months of jus horsin around and doin nuthin. I dern even know what the hell Im sayin anymore. All i know is I miss 8th grade. I mean, I got to hang out with the gurl I wuv ya know? I had my whole crew, or I guess I should say crews. Not to say I don't love our hang out n stuff ... but like, I derno. Eh, we'll see if I can make sense outta this later ...... but if someone thinks they can help, by all means go ahead.

       Found this on MSN.com... thought it was something worth sharing:  We all want to be in fun and healthy relationships, so we strive to find partners to share our lives with. Yet some of us try too hard, creating an environment that actually keeps us from getting what we want. Why? Wanting is attractive, needing is not.   Phil Holcomb, a Seattle-based personal coach and owner of Extraordinary Learning says the means to a successful end lies in overcoming your attachments to results without giving up on your goals and dreams.   The difference between wanting and needing often comes up when we try too hard. We all need to put in effort to get what we want, but trying too hard makes us appear needy. We try too hard, Holcomb says, because we're unwilling "to do the work necessary to 'fill our own cup' and operate under the illusion (false belief) that if we just find the right partner we will be okay with ourselves. That's taking the victim position that Mr./Ms. Right will 'make' me feel happy, full, content, satisfied."   The problem with that is twofold:    If your relationship with yourself is incomplete, you'll tend to attract people with same incompleteness. "Ugh. The person I really want is someone who is living a full, relatively satisfying life and has a strong, healthy relationship with herself/himself," Holcomb says. "That person is not looking for me or other people who are 'running on empty.'"    Focusing on finding what you need in another person perpetuates the myth that how you feel about yourself and your life is about something "out there." And because of that orientation, you spend resources  time, money and energy  on a losing proposition. "Keeping your focus on strengthening your relationship with yourself sometimes does not pay the immediate rewards of being infatuated. However, in the long run, when you're on your game, you attract keepers."  Shifting away from neediness requires a steadfast focus on living your life to the fullest  as a single person   Holcomb suggests thinking about the people to whom you are most attracted. "They don't spend their time 'fishing in the relationship pond'. They are busy being active and productive in pursing the experiences that result in them feeling good about themselves  independent of a lot of external validation."   "They are 'winning' in the sense that they are certain they are in the process of creating what is important to them," Holcomb continues. "Although they may want partners for the value of sharing their lives with someone special and finding deeper intimacy, they do not think they have to have one to be 'okay', 'whole' or 'complete.' Why? Because they already experience themselves that way."  How, then, can you go from needy to non-striving?   "As Yoda said to Luke Skywalker, 'No trying. Do or don't do,'" Holcomb advises. "Get very clear about what you want in a partner  so specific as to seem improbable. Include values, interests, appearance, education, history, geography, etc. Hold the intention of attracting people of this ilk. Then focus on doing what is necessary to create and maintain a healthy relationship with yourself. People who are right with themselves are exceedingly attractive. Other people want to be around them."

       Not too damn bad of a day today. At 6th period we went to the library. What happened was, the author of one of my favorite books (Love Rules) Marilyn Reynolds came to Cleveland. our class dropped by, asked her questions, listened to passages from the book, things like that. Afterward, there were copies of her books being sold for cheap, so I bought a copy of Love Rules. The awesome thing was...... she actually signed it for me! Wo0t! =D Then when I got out of the school, I was surprised by Daddy who actually came to pick me up for once. Then once I got home I was left to cook the chicken .... and I wuv chicken so.... \m/. So besides the fact that I have an insane amount of homework... today's been totally awesome. I guess I should go do it now. Im out.

       OKcupid results:   Lusty but indirect. Kind, but also using friendship as a means to sex. Oh, that feels gooood. You are The Backrubber.       We call you "The Backrubber" because you straddle that fine line between coming on to someone and just treating her nicely. Backrubs are just one example; you'd meet for coffee, or talk about books/movies, or even argue a little bit, all the while mostly preferring to screw.       Your indirect approach is not some evil trickery, but rather a result of your open mind. You'd enjoy either love or sex, but the latter definitely doesn't require the former. While you are responsible and ambitious, you absolutely DON'T have uptight views on relationships. So ultimately, you just enjoy a woman, and let things take their course. If she wants you, great. If not, that's fine too.       Though you're not thinking too much about Love at this point in your life, odds are, when the time comes, you'll be very happy settling down. Your ideal mate is gentle and horny, just like you.

       "We inevitably reach the point where we'll say life sucks. Why? From craving after things, or clinging to thoughts, which never truly satisfy.... born from our unrealistic images of life.... life being impermanent, and interconnected, yet we try to make out that it isn't. Nevertheless, every human being can free themselves from such continual dissatisfaction. How? By recognizing the truth we resist facing, and taking steps to actualize that truth."

       Yo.... Im bored, thought Id blog. Cant think of much to say though.   Today wasn't too bad, nothing to complain about.   I wish I had something to actually talk about...... but my head is just drained. Nothing is coming to mind as of late. I guess that's why it's been easier to focus in school. I actually finished my homework BEFORE 10pm last night! I guess that happened mainly because I didn't go online at all. Maybe that's what I should do for a while, just focus on my work for a while.

       Well, I woke up early today (try 6 am) to ask my folks if I could go see Ave, Kelley, Johnny, Nathen, and Roy at the mall later. . . . well they have to work, and I have to take care of my sister. Uh.... I won't complain, of course I want to go, but at  least this way I can stay at home, play video games, eat snacks, make the house all pretty :)  Im sowie you guys, but I guess family comes first right?

       awesome day today, had Johnny over for a few hours. So awesome. We made steak ..... I think I over seasoned it but oh well :p Played video games all day and watched my bootleg copy of Kill Bill. Listened to music, talked ...... a lot! Good times . :) I realised how ambivelant I can be sometimes too. I hope I spelled that right.   Ave aint comin back till tomorrow so that kinda killed my plans ..... but it frees up my schedule so thats kewl, not that I wouldnt want to go see her. Why do I keep thinkin something's gonna happen w/ us anymore? I mean, I couldn't let anything happen cus that would be totally disrespectful to Aaron, and I'm not even sure if she's interested anymore. I don't want to come off as some kind of love-sick puppy, but ...yeah.  Ima go talk to people. L8.

       I prefer not to go into detail about all that stuff. If you want to learn a little more, go into my archives. I'm sure you'll find out. and yes, I am a virgin. The whole hyp-err-slut thing, well... I use it nicely. While I guess that last part usually has a negative, or even sexist, connotation, that all depends on how it's used. The same way "bad" can mean "not good" or "cool."

       I don't feel like doing homework right now, so Ill blog. Not that I can think of anything to say.   I want a picture-phone. Sure does come in handy. Am I right, Johnny? =p  Only 21 schooldays left. Then again, we have one week off, so that's 17. Also, we use a day for the cram session, another for the luncheon, and still another for finals.... So we're only looking at two weeks of any actual learning or work, as far as core goes anyway. Good times =).

       Today... wow. Fantastic day. It was the beginning of lunch, and as I walked to our cozy lil hang out, I saw one of the cutest gurls I have ever had the privilage of laying eyes on. So as I stand there (gawk-eyed) she actually turns to me and smiles. Not one of those fake smiles either. I wasn't able to talk right for about a minute.   After school was the 1st half of the squad competition (between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd periods.) If we didn't get 1st place then hell has just frozen over. I really don't mean to brag, but even the Battalion Commander and 1SG Sullivan were astonished. I still have to give props to the other companies, cus it takes a pretty big set to get out there.   Good grief, must do homework.

       Damn romanticism. Sometimes it just hits me how worth it it can be to go after someone. I mean, I KNOW it, but sometimes it just makes so much sense... it's like rediscovering something you might have lost. Like reconnecting with an old friend, or reviving memories of someone or something that once made you feel like the center of the universe.   I've been learning to appreciate all these seemingly insignificant instances in my day. Like one of those really pretty zephyr winds that seduces you with its gentle embrace. Or waiting in a long line, and when you reach the end, the cute girl at the counter gives you a sweet little smile. Having a great song come up on the radio, one of those songs that just seems to fit the mood. Or walking all the way home after a long day only to realise that the weekend has arrived. I can go on and on. No list of examples could give enough credit to the feeling I get from those instances. Sure is incredible how they can pile up if we take the time to notice them.

       Im havin a bit of a crisis. I want to change my damn blog title but I can't fins anything I like. I don't feel like settling either. That'd just be crap. Blub. Everything would be great if I could use more space for it, but short, sweet, and to the point would be a bit more tasteful. I guess the problem is I don't know what I want. Maybe I should go figure that out before I make any drastic changes.   Then again, I think my original title (the one I've kept longest) has suited me better than I've given it credit for. The ony thing that's changed is the pretext behind it. So rather than the crap I see... it's the sporadic breaks in my boring routine.

       Yesterday was amazing. In Frame's class, all we were doin was workin on this outline thingy. When she gave us the assignment, she gave passes to people who wanted to work outside! So I sat alone outside between E and D halls. It was soooo pretty! The wind was blowing and it just felt so .. . . . incredible. *sigh*... It was one of those times that was so great that you know you could have only enjoyed it on your own.   Today was pretty awesome too. We started CAT6 testing. I love this time of year! It gives me time to catch up on my sleep. I just turned on my CD player and drifted away. I woke up with drool on my arm... but I didn't care cus it felt so great. I got to march the company too. Im prety sure I did great.   Now all I gots left to do is homework, study, and uhh .... ill think of other stuff too.

       Listening to what was my first ever taste of Linkin Park... its almost nostalgic..  "Things aren't the way they were before. You wouldn't even recognize me anymore. Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me  in the end."  Im still trying to figure out the whole song =p. Sure makes me think though ... why am I so hung up on answering crap? Excuse my pun .... but in the end .. does it really matter? Im such a whore =)

       You are a Mastermind! (Submissive Introverted Abstract Thinker) You are a MASTERMIND (SIAT). You can be silent and withdrawn, but behind your reserved exterior lies an active mind that allows you to analyze situations and come up with creative, unexpected solutions. Normal people call this scheming.   Anyway, your sense of style and originality are your strengths, and people will respect your judgment once they get to know you. If you learn to be a little more personable, you could be a great leader you've definitely got the vision thing down. Just make sure all the plotting you do behind those eyes of yours is healthy.

       I should apologize for not blogging lately. My internet's been down for some reason. Just started working again last night. I spent my time just catchin up on blogs and checking my mail. Surprisingly, no one updated.... or hardly anyone I should say.   This weekend's gonna be filled w/ homework, luckily though, me and Aaron got an extention on our Marine Bio project shizzle. I still gots Korean, Geometry, and CORE to lok forward to. Speaking of core, I got my schedule for next year. Im a bit reluctant to take AP Bio.... I think I might save my APs for 11th and 12th. Maybe take 2/ year. Not too bad right?  Right now Im on my bro's laptop while he holds my PC hostage. I think I geting used to typing on this thingy. Listening to some old Sugar Ray stuff. It seems so old... even if its only from the late 90s.  Im such a whore. Ill be back later :)

       Today was pretty great. My brother and I went for a run in the morning. 'Twas pretty fun. We went up to Vanalden running through Saticoy, then took a right up to Arminta and back home. Once there, I showered up, cleaned house (literally), and chilled for a while. Around 1, the air was blowing really pretty-ly, so I walked over to my mommy's bed 'cause it's right next to the window. I napped till 4 =P. At 4:30, Mom and I were out the door again, ready to take advantage of the sexy zephyr-like winds. Jebus Christ, it felt great. Now I'm here, sitting at my computer, listening to Linkin Park, hangin out. Feelin good =D.

I was playing Agent Under Fire today... and I got to the last level, but I got frustrated and turned off the game. Problem was.. I didn't save it =P Wow... and I had just gotten past the snipers too. Oh well. Ive beaten it before anywayz.   Crap. Im cold. *shiver*. well... since no one's gonna come and help keep me warm, I guess Ill just go get in bed. Nighty night everyone.

       Damn man, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not gonna try to tell you it's gonna go away soon... that'd be a lie. All I can say is that I hope you pull through this sooner than I did.   There's no need to be sorry about anything. You got to be w/ her fair and square. I won't try to say much more. All I can say is that this is one thing you have to try to go through on your own. Don't take people's BS about "there's more fish in the sea" or "you'll meet someone nice" cus I know you probably don't wanna hear it. If ya wanna talk to me about something though. Email me instead. Get my address in my profile if you don't already have it. Anywho, take care dude. Best of luck and all that good stuff.

       Today was kewl. Woke up at 7 and immediately ate breakfast. Around 7:30 i started streaching n stuff. and I was out the door for a run at around 8. I got back at 8:30 and did some more exersize.. then I showered and washed the dishes before anyone was awake. It felt good to actually FEEL awake at 9 in the morning.   After that I went to work w/ dad for a while... he got to take some measurements while I hauled away cement refuse. afterward we ate @ wendy's, then headed off to some place where we were laying down these esigner tiles. Half the time I was kicking aluminum bottles off a makeshift tee ball pole.   Right before we got home we stopped at a gas station to get something to drink. I filled up the cup with like 3 different sodas. I asked my bro to guess what they were and the lil bitch got em all right =o   I think Ima start up tae kwon do again this summer. If anything it'll give me something to do. Woah... I stink. I need a shower =\

       Well, freshman year's almost over. Im quite frankly not in the mood to do that whole shout-out thing. You guys know who you were that made me feel good and made the year worth it. I also know I might not see some of you later on. To you I say, Im always gonna be here for ya, and whatever you may need, don't hesitate to ask. Im never too busy for my the people I care about.   Enough of that. IUE's over, last one till the fall. Just one project left, after that, we're good to go for summer. Right now, all I have to do is sit back and listen to the sounds of the traffic and my music playing off each other. They really do go beautifully together. That might just be me, but it sure does feel pretty right now.

       Why men are afraid to say the "L" word- by Alan Goldsher  THE JINX FACTOR The fear that declaring love for the sweetie will put the kibosh on a relationship is a distinctly male thing. It's kind of like in baseball, when a pitcher's throwing a no-hitter, you're not supposed to mention it to him, because you don't want to get the hurler out of his groove. Men are weird like that.  THE COMMITMENT FACTOR Most men realize that once the love thing is out there, he's in there for the long haul. Most men also realize it would be karmically heinous to declare your love, then bail two weeks later.  THE SCARE-AWAY FACTOR What if you tell her you love her, and she runs out of the room screaming? Worse yet, what if she keeps running? Say, to Istanbul? Ouch.  THE OPENING-YOUR-HEART FACTOR This is especially applicable if it's your first love. You can't quibble with this one, because leaving your heart unprotected  especially if you've never done it before  is truly frightening.   THE RECIPROCATION FACTOR There aren't many worse feelings than telling your honey you love her, and her coming back with something like, "That's sweet. Thank you." Ugh.  THE SCREWING-UP-THE-DELIVERY FACTOR What if you stutter over the word love? What if you call her by the wrong name? What if you say, "I love glue"? Any one of these could kill a relationship. Any two of them could scar you for life.  THE SCREWING-UP-THE-WHOLE-DAMN-THING FACTOR What if you're trembling so badly that you spill red wine on her white blouse? What if you choose a restaurant filled with screaming kids? What if you pee your pants? If she's a cool chick, she'll overlook all that, but nonetheless, it's all ugly stuff.  THE RECIPROCATION FACTOR, PART 2 She might tell you she loves you too  which is nerve-wracking, because it's been said that getting exactly what you ask for is daunting. But remain undaunted, gentleman, because  to reiterate Babs's on-target observation  love is soft as an easy chair. And more often than not, an easy chair is the world's most comfortable place to be.

Just got some studying done for the next IUE, now Im listening to some mp3 my bro's playing... its basically the sounds of a Latin porn in action. Funniest shit EVER!   I wanna go out somewhere. Pretty much anywhere. As long as it's someplace I camn just sit... somewhere to do nothing. I guess I'll be doing the same thing I'm doing now,just in a different setting.   Yippie, no more uniforms on monday!   Just got back from a walk around the neighborhood. I started this post like ... 2 hours ago =P. Amazing. Ima go write in this pretty writing tablet i bought.

       T'was such a beautiful day today. I wonder if anyone else noticed? The sun was shining, the birds were singing, there was a cool zephyr blowing. And you know it had to be a special day because the sun was shining while the moon was in plain sight. I'm done w/ my homework, Tomorrow's the China unit luncheon (not to mention the ROTC awards ceremony.) Summer's gonna be here in just a few days. I have no plans whatsoever, no stress, just time. Time to sit back, relax, & find out what a pretty place the word can be.   There's a few things I'd like to do this summer. I'll definetly be going out to see people. I'll try to do more individual stuff. Maybe I'll even grow a spine and ask gurls out. Lets just keep those group things to a minimum.   I'll burn new CD's. I'll go take walks more often. I might go as far as to lose my baby fat and work out. I'll unplug the TV every once in a while. I hear after a few days, you hardly miss it anyway.   Gonna hang w/ tons of ppl. Let's make a list:  Johnny, Roy, Haress, Coco, Chris, David, Jose, Ave, Cathy, Jessica, Eryn, Aaron, Stanley, and a lot more. *note, some of these people still don't know they're gonna hang out w/ me yet =D.   Blub, Ima go now. Hope tomorrow's even better than today was.

I mean, give it a few years and that's gonna be me.. ya know? Wow. So old.       Today was nice too. Got to go swimming after school, and umm....... I'll probably lay out and do nothing all weekend. Should be fun.

        These past few hours were great. Met up w/ Ashley and her friends Tiffany and Rayne (hope I spelled em right), watched The Bourne Supremacy w/ them. Hung out at Linens n Things afterward. Once they were gone,&nbsp;I want to go see I, Robot.&nbsp;Will Smith..... Wow. That man is.......... Just.......... Wow.     ANYWHO, umm,&nbsp;I stayed walkin around till about 6, went to the iMac store to talk to my bro. He&nbsp;made me come home.. So&nbsp;I did,&nbsp;making this the 10th time&nbsp;I've walked either to or from the mall. *celebration dance*. Once home, I layed down and chilled... which is pretty much what I've been doing since around 7.     &nbsp;   It was great being in the mall alone for once. Not that I minded hangin out w/ the gurls, cause in all honesty, they were pretty kewl. It's just... I don't know. Being able to walk around by yourself in such a social place, it gives you a sense of empowerment. Plus, I was listenin to my latest mix full blast, so I was rockin my head while walkin around from store to store. Felt great. I should do that more often.    &nbsp;

       I wasn't really expecting too much out of today. I didn't go in with the highest of hopes for any fun. I had the greatest day.... like... yeah. I really did. I got to the mall at around 2:40. Met up w/ Nathen and waited w/ him for Kelley and Ave to arrive. So Then the two of them show up, big hugs all around, and all that mushy stuff I wuv. We walk to see the puppies at Petworld. Those puppies are adooooooooorable!! I was sooooo giddy =P. Then we go into that cheap lil photo booth thingy near there. I'll scan those later. I actually came out good too, so that was kewl. Umm, I think we visited a few stores, bought food, and all that good stuff. The best part though, was when we sat down in the furniture aisle at JCPenny. For most of the time I was resting my head on Kelley's lap. I don't think I've ever been petted so much. It felt great though. I could have stayed there for hours on end. At the same time I was kinda playin footsie w/ Ave. I need to hang out w/ Nathen more too. That boy is amazing. Then we looked at the time and it was like... 3 minutes 'til we had to go. So we got up and left. Mmmm, I felt really... relaxed. I wuv those guys. Lets do it again soon.  I should go burn Kelley's Cd now. I'm off.

       The first week of summer school seemed a bit short. Then again, maybe that's 'cause it started on a Wednesday. I kinda wanna go out tomorrow, since the carpet's going to be cleaned starting at around 9 in the morning. Eh, I'll probably just hang at the park for a while.  The walk home was nice. I've been walkin to Tampa after school w/ Stephanie (hope that's how you spell it.) She's pretty kewl, except w/ the whole hesitation towards hugs. I can't hold that against anyone though. No worries. I wanna have long, pretty hair like yours =[.   I want to stay awake, but I have nothing to like... do. Wutev, I'll jus go listen to music.

       1st day of summer school. It was pretty yummy. I hardly know anyone in my classes, but most of em seem nice. In health we somehow managed to go from a definition of emotional health to whether it's okay for America's presidents to get head. I wasn't really mood for so much idealism so damn early in the day. That's why I'm gonna wake up early and go for a quick run tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have a bit more energy when I get to school.   Life skills is the only class I really have to worry about though. It's just a bit boring. After those two hours though, I'm pretty much home free. I get to walk home, listening to my CDs along the way. Yumm.  Maybe I should actually do that life skills homework now. Wuuuuutever. It's either that or listening to music for a while, but Ill prebably jus do both at the same time and get nothing done =P.

       As it turns out, we ended up going to that potluck thing. I'm actually glad we got to go though, 'cause I got to watch my sis run from bees carrying carne asada. =P. Oh My Jebus! There were soooo many bees. Not kewl. After about an hour or so of panicking, me and my bro settled down to a few rounds of chess. I was doing really good for once, even though I lost every match.  Umm, I might go out tomorrow. If I don't go to Citywalk I might have plans to do somethin else. I still don't know if ANY of those will happen, so I might just end up playing games all day. Either way, should be fun tomorrow.  "Eww! Your sweat tastes bad!!" ---> I'm never going to that park again.... EVER!

       People keep tellin me it's supposed to be some holiday tomorrow. I forget which so eh. The folks were planning to take us to some huge potluck w/ their co-workers... but luckily we aren't going anymore. I don't like to seem anti-social, but I guess I can be sometimes. I hate those huge gatherings. Too much tension and pressure to try to get along w/ everyone, and if I try to not give a damn my parents would get pissed at me. Oh well, no need to worry about it anymore.   We got to eat Jack In The Box for dinner. Me and my sis got in a fight over who would get which amount of which currency (10 dollars or 100 pesos.) We were laughin our asses off when we figured out they were pretty much the same amount.  Saw Spider-Man 2 on Wednesday. There was less of a line than I thought there would be. Maybe people thought there would be a huge rush the 1st few days, so they would come later. The movie was really good, but if you hadn't seen the 1st one it would have been better. I expected too much, and when I got what I wanted, I didn't realize it. Just like what happened w/ The Matrix. I guess the trick to getting some of these sequals right is to not compare them to their predecessor.   Woah, I'm sleepy. Must go.

       What a day. Let's see. I got up at around 11. Started playin games, at breakfast, and chilled for a few hours. But THEN, Jose and Roy decide to invite themselves over =P. So Momma makes me buy chicken for everyone so we can have enough food... since these two have bottomless pits for stomachs (hope I spelled that right.) So we ate and snacked and played the games we rented for hours and hours.... damn. It really does get exhausting after a while. Well, everything's kewl now. Ave's comin home tomorrow, I get to go over to Johnny's house tomorrow as well. Blub, Ima go.

        Went for a walk today. It was fun... even though I was kinda on a timeline. I had to get from Chase st. to the LA Times delivery place in 30 minutes. Made it in 20... but it woulda been more fun to jus go by strolling instead of having to whizz past some old ladies.      I jus found the worst pun in my About section thingy... I feel so bad. But it's a good song, so I guess I can let it slip. I sure would love a car though. One that I could drive legally. One day I'll have my hott lil sex car... CD player on full blast as I fly down Ventura w/ no traffic @ night. Wishful thinking I guess, but I can dream.      I wanna go to the mall and just sit on one of those couches... observing people. I just can't think of very many other places where so many different people come together peacefully (most of the time.) I'd love  to drag Aaron along and have him and I do a duet for chump change next to JCPenny.  I'm sure gonna miss you, man. I hate to make it sound like some evil, permenant... thing, 'cause it's not. I'll jus stop here so I don't go into a whole "bye for now" speech.         I'm thinkin of changin my temp. I wanna go back to my old one. I liked that one, 'cept this time I wont add so much crap. Like that stupid guest book. I had like......  4  people sign it. Eh, Im off. Getting sleepy.

        New month, new archive. Yayy!       School tomorrow. Only about 2 weeks left.. thankfully. I'm sick of Ms. Bazan. What a prick. I can't think of anyone else who goes talking about non-spanish speaking kids behind their backs. She even did it to me! Hellooooo! Ugh. Am I THAT pale? Wutev, I'm still passing. I think I can hold out for 2 more weeks.       Hmm, wish i had more to say. No wonder I havnt been getting comments.
