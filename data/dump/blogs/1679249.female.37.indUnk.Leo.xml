       Photo of the Day for Feb. 16, 2003 --   The Lady in Red      Photographer:  Margaret Schmidt  Comments:  A photo I've been playing with trying to get that old time portrait look with a charcoal look...  Camera used:  Canon D60  Geo. location:   Bob's comments:  Well, this is my first choice for POTD and boy o boy was it a difficult choice or what?  There are some SUPERB submissions, really there are.   How you guys maintain your standards day in and day out, I really don't know.  In the end, my choice was The Lady In Red - there's a sort of mystery about her that's simply beguiling.

       "The photos suck."  No, the Photo of the Day winners are great actually, but some of you have expressed honest concern about the image quality being shown here. Starting with the next POTD winner published (on 2/16), the image you see here will be just a "thumbnail" -- you click on it to view the full-size image. I am sorry that I haven't been doing that yet, it's still a new system for me but I think it will be cool to have all of the POTD winners for the week on this one page. Then, you can just click on the image if you're interested in seeing it at the highest resolution. Cool?

       Photo of the Day for Feb. 15, 2003 --  A Moment of Beauty      Photographer:  Deborah Walmsley  Comments:  There are so many beautiful sunset's here in Idaho, and I've often tried capturing their beauty, but always from my front yard.  On this evening, we hurried out on a venture looking for a new and better location to capture this sunset.  The area we found in this photo is in Eagle, Idaho.  This was a very special day, and was important to me to photograph this sunset, as it was my dear Mother's Birthday.  Camera used:  Sony Cybershot  Geo. location:  Idaho  David's comments:  Great sunset shot, Deborah -- I've seen plenty of them in the past, they get boring after a while, but the rich tones and the interesting foreground sets this one apart and makes it unique. A deserving win!  (by the way, I really enjoyed a few of the other entries received today, will roll some over to the next day's contest!)

       Photo of the Day for Feb. 14, 2003 --  Comfy      Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  This shot was taken at Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World on Feb 8, 2003 using a Canon EOS D30.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D30  Geo. location:  Florida  David's comments:  Great wildlife photograph, Jim! The pose and framing of this image is excellent as well.

Don't stop sending your daily entry just because you haven't won in a while -- be persistent and continue to take creative shots!

       Photo of the Day for Feb. 13, 2003 --  Ruffled Feathers      Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Comments:  Not the zoo this time, Sea World.  LOL  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  California  David's comments:  Good coloration in the background and an excellent subject. Now I know how Cheryl feels, it is ridiculously difficult to pick the winner of these contests... We had another animal entry that was awesome as well, in addition to some great landscape shots. If only we could have two winners a day (hmm...)

       Great! The upgrade to the  Photo of the Day  service was successful...  Now you can view each daily winner from this page. I think that will make things easier. Also, I think that we  all  need to give a huge thanks to  Cheryl Meisel  for being our POTD judge up until now for over a year. That's awesome, and she has done a tremendous amount of work to help Shutterline get to where it is today.  (come back here every 24 hours to view the latest winning photo, starting on 2/13)

Camera used:  Olympus C-730 UZ  Judge's comments:  I think Mariette says it all - it's the eyes, the eyes!   This is the first thumbnail POTD that we've tried.  You should be able to click on it and be taken to Mariette's fullsize submission

Not being a gardener of any description - well I mow a mean lawn! - what I'd really like to know is what sort of flower it is !

       Photo of the Day for Feb. 20, 2003 --  Down to the Waterline      Photographer:  Jum Carper  Comments:  There's a little spot where some shrimpboats dock in Mayport that makes a nice backdrop for various birds flying by, including various herons, egrets, osprey, and of course, plenty of brown pelicans.  Date  19th February 2003  Camera used:  Canon EOS D30  Geo. location:  Mayport, Florida  Judge's comments:  The Bird Man of Florida does it again!  Amongst some truly superb entries for POTD, Jim's brilliant capture stood out.  I've no idea Jim, quite how you manage these shots.  The way I see it is that the birds see you coming and just start queueing up to pose for your camera because they know they'll be a POTD

Camera used: Sony DSC F707  Geo. location: Sedona, Arizona  Judge's comments: This is one of those photographs that you keep going back to, over and over again.  The contrasts of light and dark, the remarkable textures, the lines that are in it, all just make it compulsive.   I'm almost sure that if I touched it, I could feel it ...

Part of it says "dull and tiresome" and that's the very LAST thing that can be said about this picture.  It's full of colour and every time I look at it I see something different in it.   I could look at it for a long while.   In fact, it's time to change my desktop picture so Cheryl ... if I may?   o:)

       Photo of the Day for March 1, 2003 --  City Sunset Reflections    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  I took this late in the day in mid September.  I had taken some shots and walked up the street and when I returned, I saw all these wonderful golden tones bouncing off all the buildings and I shot it some more.  Camera used:  Fuji FP 2800  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  I love the 'golden tones' of the reflections. An excellent city shot, not your ordinary cityscape.    Reminder:  You can click on the small thumbnail image to load the full-size image. Also, if you're not yet a member, now's a pretty good time to  urlLink join us .

It's a Dam and reservoir near Jasper, Texas. Four dams were planned in the 1940s. Only Dam "B" was built.   Camera used:  Canon D60, Canon 20mm 2.8 EF  Geo. location:  Texas  Judge's comments:  A perfect sunset photo. I love the rich colors and the horizon line. Very deserving win!

       Photo of the Day for Thursday, Feb.27th, 2003 --  The Diner    urlLink     Photographer:  Kay Prather  Comments:  Entrance to a diner in South, La. I  like the colors, lines and simplicity..  Camera used:  Nikon CoolPix 995  Judge's comments:  I agree with Kay that the colours and the lines and the overall simplicity of the photograph really make it memorable.  I especially liked the way my eyes were drawn, through the lines to the door.   An intriguing image which raises the question is "What awaits you behind the door?".  You'd just HAVE to go in and find out.

       Photo of the Day for Wednesday, Feb.26th, 2003 --  Thief!    urlLink     Photographer:  James Powers  Comments:  > We were enjoying a picnic Sunday at a small roadside park near here when a squirrel decided to raid the bag of Cheeto's left on the table. He made a  quick run up a tree about 10 foot from the table and enjoyed his treat.  Camera used:  Canon D60, Canon 75-300mm lens  Geo. location:  Texas  Judge's comments:  This must be real fun for the squirrel - look at the twinkle in it's eyes and that HUGE smile !!   If the squirrel is that good at pinching bits and pieces of food from a table, look out for your nuts.  ;o)

       Photo of the Day for Tuesday, Feb.25th, 2003 --  Arches and Pipes    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  This is the front of the Sanctuary of First Baptist Church of Philadelphia.  The interior is beautiful and this is a small portion.  We gave a concert here on Saturday night.  Camera used:  Fuji FP 2600  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Once again, this is a high class photograph which is full of wonderful detail which very much kept my eye occupied way beyond simply looking at it.  There's also a "depth" to it which is equally pleasing.

I liked the layered look of the roof edges.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Judge's comments:  This is a great capture. The lines of the roofs are just, well, magnetic.  And then I found my attention being drawn to somewhere else and suddenly I realised there's a lot, lot more in the picture than was apparent at first.

Looking at it makes you wonder how many people have sat there, looking at the wonderful view, and simply enjoying the sun.  If that bench could talk, it could tell a tale or two, no doubt of it.  It's a totally enchanting photograph

       Photo of the Day for Saturday, March 8th, 2003 --  Above the Clouds    urlLink     Photographer:  Richard Bennett  Comments:  Though I was only standing on a small hill this shot makes it look like I was miles high when I took this.  Camera used:  Sony MVC FD97  Geo. location:  Idaho  Judge's comments:  If you take time out just to look at Richard's photo for a while, all the sounds of the world go away and suddenly, you're up there with the eagle. Try it!  But if you wanted some mood music to go along with the image, what about the Jennifer Warnes - Joe Cocker song from "An Officer and a Gentleman"?  The lyrics could easily have been inspired by this image.  Mind you Richard, I really do hope you weren't "miles high" when you took it ...;o)

       Photo of the Day for Friday, March 7th, 2003 --  Shadows on the Path    urlLink     Photographer:  Janet Pedersen  Comments:  This was taken in Feb. '03 at the Grand Canyon.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Grand Canyon  Judge's comments:  There are, for me, two big things about this photograph.  First of course is the subject of the title, the Shadows which are on the path.  It's great the way Janet has managed to use shadows to move your eye right through the picture instead of the fence itself which would, I think, normally have been the case. A clever idea.The second thing that makes it a POTD for me is the really good use of the "digital darkroom" to create the sepia effect. The result is an extremely powerful image which may not have been quite as strong in colour.  Great stuff all round.

Camera used:  Canon EOS D30 w/Canon 100-400mm L lens  Geo. location:  Jacksonville, Florida  Judge's comments:  I don't know about JudyJudyJudy:  all I can think of is "JimJimJim"!!   This is quite simply an amusing, amazing shot.  Congratulations Jim on being there to take it.  Wonderful.

       Photo of the Day for Wednesday, March 5th, 2003 - -  Tropical Colours    urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  We saw lots of these pretty, light, bright colours when we were in the Caribbean the last week in January.   I'm afraid I can't remember for sure on exactly which island we saw this particular building, unfortunately.  I have great memories of the week we spent on our holiday.  I just wish that my memory for where we saw what we saw was great, too!  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Somewhere in the Caribbean  Judge's comments:  Gerda's photograph makes me feel, well, jealous!!  :o)  I'm joking of course ... Heck, no I'm not!!  I  am  jealous - of the sunshine and the blue, blue sky and all those beautiful, beautiful colours of the Caribbean which have been so expertly captured here by Gerda.  Just looking at the picture makes you feel the warmth of the sun on your back ...

Apart from anything else, fish never seem to be where you want them to be!   The colours are great and the overall feeling of motion generated by the weed in the background is a big plus as well.

Camera used:  Canon EOS D30  Geo. location:  Florida  Judge's comments:  Another great wildlife shot from Jim! I liked the water droplets, a nice touch. Also, thanks for providing a useful description -- telling us what kind of lens you used is always a good thing to do.

Camera used:  Sony Cybershot DSC-F707  Geo. location:   not provided   Judge's comments:  There were a lot of great photos submitted for today's contest, but something struck me about this photo. Maybe it's the colors or the geometry. Or, maybe it's the amazing variety of yogurt. Anyway, it's a unique shot -- congratulations.

       Photo of the Day for Saturday, March 15th 2003 --  Patterns    urlLink     Photographer:  Cheyrl Tessens  Comments:  What caught my interest for this shot were the similiar colors and patterns between the dried yellow roses and the tray they were setting on.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Holly, MI  Judge's comments:  I can't do any more than agree with Cheryl.  There is a striking similarity and it's that which initially catches the eye.  But there's more than that as well. I actually ran Cheryl's photo through Elements and brightened it up - and surprisingly, it then sort of "fails" if you see what I mean.  I think it's because there's also an overall mood to the image which is lost in processing it.  I like it a lot and as it is.

       Photo of the Day for Friday, March 14th 2003 --  A Window Cleaner's Nightmare    urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Comments:  Taken of a tall office building in Tyson's corner.  Desaturated all color channels except blue.  Increased saturation of blue.  Crop, resize, unsharpen mask.  Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  What a truly staggering image. I was taken with it as soon as I saw it. I really do like the way Franziska has created the whole effect of perspective and colour - and the lack of it - combined in the one photograph.  And the explanation of how it was done is there for all of us to share.  Great, great stuff.

It looked dumb, but it worked.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Topeka, Kansas  Judge's comments:  There are times when dedication to a cause just have to have it's rewards and this is one of them!  What a terrific idea Doug! - and what a result!  It's simply wonderful  I don't know about looking dumb but if this is the sort of capture you can get then more power to your elbow!!

It gave such a pretty color and light in the forest.   Camera used:  Nikon Coolpix 995  Geo. location:  Not known ...  Judge's comments:  This really is a magical picture, full of contrasts, lines, light, shadows - and a mysterious glow in the background!  It's also quite amazing how Sue found enough light at that time of the morning to get the image ... did you have to take manual control of the camera Sue, or was it done on a programmed setting?  Share your secret? :o)

I modified it to some extent at the time, and then played around with it a bit more a few days ago.  Camera used:  Olympus C-3020Z  Judge's comments:  There's something about really good digital art that I find fascinating. And Gerda's picture is just that: really good digital art.  I think this is an example of there being no such thing as a "bad" photograph as it proves what amazing effects can be achieved in the digital darkroom.

Camera used:  Olympus E20  Judge's comments:  I really liked the way Lyn has captured the light in her photograph and especially the way it's reflected off the snow and ice and the metal.  There really is an "emptiness" about Lyn's picture whilst at the same time the light suggests it's at it's end too.  A well constructed and gently provocative image.   Great.

       Photo of the Day for Saturday, March 22nd 2003 --  Perched    urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Comments:  A tiny butterfly/moth (?) that hardly ever sat still and was very sensitive to any kind of movement.  I chased the poor thing around the yard all afternoon before I got a couple of shots of it.  It could've made life much easier for both of us! ;)  Used the Canon PS Pro90 at full zoom with macro attachment for this one.  Camera used:  Canon PS Pro90 IS  Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  Franziska's final image just has to bereward for her dedication!  Chasing a butterfly  all afternoon  is above and beyond the call of duty in my humble opinion!!  At the end though, it really is worth it. Incredible detail, depth, colour - it's all there.  I for one am very glad that the little devil finally agreed to pose for the picture to be taken.  I reckon every single one of us has tried to do exactly what Franziska has managed - and failed !    A very worthy POTD.

       Photo of the Day for Friday, March 21st 2003 --  A Study in Blue    urlLink     Photographer:  Ron Case  Comments:  This is a picture of the Wellsville Mountains in Northern Utah. It was taken around noon on a very bright day which still had a slight smoggy overcast to it. This gave everything a bluish tint to it.  This is a composition of 4 pictures which I stitched together. The shots were handheld. I used Photoshop Elements to enhance the bluish cast.  Camera used:  Kodak DC3400  Geo. location:  Wellsville, UT  Judge's comments:  Today's choice almost picks itself as it's the first panoramic view that has been submitted for the "new" way of presenting the POTD from the Shutterline site but in any case, it is a glorious example of that type of photograph.  On top of that, Ron's explanation of how he achieved it - making it look  very  simple - is a big plus.  Tremendous work Ron.

       Photo of the Day for Thursday, March 20th 2003 --  Red Light District    urlLink     Photographer:  Cheryl Meisel  Comments:  Found this interesting building in downtown Toledo Ohio.  Camera used:  Sony Cybershot DSC-F707  Geo. location:  Toledo, Ohio  Judge's comments:  I think this is a really, really intriguing image which seems to set all sorts of questions.  There's definitely a certain "je ne sais quoi" about it - something you can't quite put your finger on, if you know what I mean.  There's a mysterious quality about it and the door seems to be, well, very inviting ...   I think it proves that photography can inspire the mind as well as entertain the eye and sooth the soul.  Great, great spot and capture Cheryl.

Camera used:  Fuji FinePix 2800  Geo. location:  Philadelphia PA  Judge's comments:  A  little  crazy Robert?  But we're glad you did because you could then share this great photograph with us all !   I especially liked the great splash of colour it presents.  I have no idea how hard you had to work at getting the backlighting working or what you used to do it, but it's mighty effective.  Share your secrets?

       Photo of the Day for Tuesday, March 18th 2003 --  Misty Sunrise    urlLink     Photographer:  Mariette Geest  Comments:  Don't know, the light through the tree, the morning fog on the ground and the rock formation. Actually the rocks are an ancient graveyard and are called 'hunebeds'. It is something special here in the Netherlands and with the light and fog ... spooky!  Camera used:  Olympus C-730 UZ  Geo. location:  The Netherlands  Judge's comments:  Indeed Mariette, this is a "spooky" image.  In particular I really do like the way you've been able to capture the light which seems to "bounce" off everything, especially the mist.

Camera used:  Nikon Coolpix 995  Geo. location:  The Niagara River  Judge's comments:  If ever there was a photo that captured Nature's extremes in one, Sherry's is it.  The beauty of Nature in the colours of the trees, her fury in the raging river and her threats in the sky, all there for us to see in one image.   Sherry, what a shot!

This marvellous, wonderful composition by Lyn is one of those. Just breathtaking, Lyn.

Camera used:  Olympus E20  Geo. location:  Minden, ON, Canada  Judge's comments:  I think Lyn's photo is quite, quite wonderful.  It's so good, I feel I ought to be able to reach out and tickle the "Old Puppy" - and what an inspired title that is! - under the chin.  Beautiful detail in a picture that really is, quite genuinely, alive.  So much so that it looks like the old guy is going to leap out of the screen!

You can see the colours and the light but you can also feel the warmth of the sunshine that's reflected.   Magical.

Camera used:  Canon D60  Judge's comments:  In these deeply troubled times, Margaret's picture should serve as profound advice to all those who lead us, wherever we are in the world.  "Relax ..."  says it all.   And apart from that, the photo just appealed to my sense of humour!  Loved it!!

       Photo of the Day for Wednesday, March 26th 2003 --  Red White and Blue    urlLink     Photographer:  Kaye Grogan  Comments:  This is the front of an OfficeMax building.  I noticed the red trim with the blue sky and white clouds and I immediately thought of a "patriotic" theme.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Martinsville, Virginia  Judge's comments:  I wouldn't want to comment on the theme that Kaye saw and which prompted her to take this wonderful image but I was struck by everything about it.  In particular I really liked the lines and the angles and the colour and the "sharpness" of the light in it.  I'm simply very glad she saw it!

       Photo of the Day for Tuesday, March 25th 2003 --  Village by the Grange    urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  The Village by the Grange is a small mall close to the AGO (the Art Gallery of Ontario--the public art gallery for our province).  I took this photo in the very early evening.  The lights had just come on and it wasn't yet really dark.  The camera was hand held.  I'd have used a tripod if I'd had one with me, but I didn't.  I was quite happy with how this turned out,  though.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Canada  Judge's comments:  It's amazing that Gerda managed to capture this image with just a hand held camera!  I was really knocked out with the colours in the photograph which I'm sure wouldn't have been anything like so strong if it had been taken in the middle of the day.  A time and a place for everything!!

       Photo of the Day for Monday, March 24th 2003 --  Radial    urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  Well, with a rack like that, how can any guy resist, eh? Oh, the joys of mating season! :^) I suppose this would be better without the branches protruding, and most would prefer it with the feet in the frame, but for me, the point of this shot is the fanning out of the plumage, so I wanted a tighter crop. Photo of this Great Egret taken at the St. Augustine Alligator Farm.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D30 w/Canon 100-400mm lens  Geo. location:  St. Augustine, Florida  Taken:  March 21, 2003   Judge's comments:  I agree with Jim.  This is one of the times when the "rules" of photography (are there really such things?) should get ripped up for the sake of the picture.  This way we get to see what must be a  very  rare display instead of worrying about the "complete" picture.  A great shot and a very worthy POTD.

Camera used:  Canon 10D  Geo. location:  Melrose, MA  Judge's comments:  A great study picked out by the very talented eye of Lesley.  I really do like the depth in the photograph and the overall way that it keeps my eyes busy, if you know what I mean.

Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Judge's comments:  A very striking submission from Janet.  I really did take to the way that the photograph is "layered" with, from the bottom, the beach, the foreshore, the sea and finally the sky.  All enhanced by the positioning of the net and it's shadow.  And to be honest, I really did think that this was a "mood" photograph.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's a definite "feel" to it.  It's one that I keep coming back to, just to look at and sort of get lost in.  A terrific image, Janet - congratulations.

       Photo of the Day for Thursday, 3rd April 2003 --  Puddle Deconstructed Construction    urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  This is a a reflection in a big puddle left by melted ice in the neighbourhood skating ring/wading pool.  What's reflected is a condo apartment tower under construction.  I liked the way the breaks in the puddle + the sun created a sort of fairytale glow + left gaps in the reflection of the almost finished building  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Judge's comments:  Today's POTD is really in the top class.  It's an amazing image in so many ways, not least of which is the fact that it has to be spotted for it's potential in the first place!  The contrasts and the changes in light in the photograph really are quite staggering.  It's also a photograph that in a sense is like one of those "what do you see when you stare at the centre spot" type things (spectrograms?).  First you see the water of the puddle, then the building, then the ripples on the water, then the building again ... Gerda, this is a really, really clever photograph and I'm very glad you submitted it to Shutterline.

       Photo of the Day for Wednesday, 2nd April 2003 --  Send Help!  I've been Macroed!    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  Well, I just had an idea and I went with it.  Camera used:  Fuji FP 2800  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  For me, one of the great things about digital photography is what can be done with an image after the shutter goes and Rob's image is a great example of that!  This is a huge amount of fun - and I can promise you, I laughed out loud when I first saw it!   I'm glad you went with the idea Rob; amongst all the gloom that's around at the moment this was one bright spot and I'm positive we can all do with that.

Franziska's POTD is a brilliant example of what I mean. It's got colour, lines, a depth, it keeps my eyes busy and it's a statement too, picked up in the title that Franziska gave it.  I did chuckle at that because we've all met them haven't we?  Congratulations Franziska.

The detail that's been captured and the depth field is quite amazing.  A very different photograph from his more normal birds, this one shows Jim is also very sensitive to what can be seen close up.  Another stunner.

Camera used:  Canon 10D  Geo. location:   Melrose, MA  Judge's comments:  A great macro shot!  'Struth Lesley, you can almost see the bee thinking!  And I bet it's saying "Excuse me!  Do you mind?  I'm eating!" :o)  Great detail + great colour + great depth = great photograph.  A stunner.

Camera used:  Olympus E20  Geo. location:  Minden, ON, Canada  Judge's comments:  The last of Winter ... the first of Spring!  It's the contrasts - in Seasons! - that make up the appeal in Lyn's photo.  Then there's the way the water leads the eye through the ice, along the reflected line of Spring, towards something better than the ice and apparent promises of warmth to come.  A terrific composition.

       Photo of the Day for Friday, 11th April 2003 --  Seed Weed    urlLink     Photographer:  Cheryl Meisel  Comments:  B&W of a weed flower.  I would assume a bird dropped the seed as it was all alone and growing in a strange place.  Camera used:  Sony 707  Geo. location:  Erie, MI  Judge's comments:  I don't know what others think of course, but it strikes me that a big problem with black and white images is that they have to be done exceptionally well to make an impression on anyone.  Well, Cheryl's photo is exactly that: exceptional.   On top of which, it makes a lovely contrast when seen side by side with the images of the two previous days. Well seen, Cheryl.

And I'm equally sure that I'd be able to detect that just-after-the-rain smell that's always there.  Great depth, detail and colours that work very well with each other. It's a really lovely image Franziska and congratulations.

A way to preserve this memory is with a picture!  Camera used:  SonyCSF-707  Geo. location:  Iowa  Judge's comments:  I totally agree with Carol that a photograph, sensitively taken and treated, is exactly the right way to record any occasion.  And you'll all know that I'm rather taken with "digital darkroom" work and what has been done with today's POTD, particularly the effect of a diffused glow, is simply ace.  Congratulations on the picture Carol, and to your daughter for her achievement.

Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  San Diego  Judge's comments:  Janet's photo is full of almost everything I would think anyone would want to see in a photograph. There's light, lines, angles, reflections, contrasts and without any doubt, colours all in there. I was struck by the feeling of motion as well, which I feel was achieved by the person on the elevator.   If you didn't get this posed for you Janet, it's a wonderful capture:  if you did get it posed - it's a wonderful shot anyway!   Loved it.

Camera used:  Sony Cybershot DSC-F707  Taken:  17th April 2003  Judge's comments:  Deborah's photograph is simply one of those that demands to be seen be as many people as possible!!  It's a charming and a fun picture and I'm sure everyone will agree.  Congratulations Deborah, on a wonderful capture.

I used yellow cardboard to hide the concrete.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Virgina  Judge's comments:  A terrific photo by Franziska. It's the idea that the shadow is far, far more important than the "real" subject that appealed to both my visual sense and my sense of humour.  I swear that the shadow is yawning .. a sort of "yeah-I've heard-all-this-before"  look !!   And the lines of it's "hat"!!   A real eye-catching treat in every respect.

There aren't.  There's just one.   The illusion that there are more is created by the shadows of our mesh, vertical venetian blinds.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Judge's comments:  Really clever Gerda, it really is.  I was also taken with the way the light through the glass has created a surreal red landscape that helps make it look like the glass may even be floating a little.  And the lines and the shadows as well ... a great shot.

Camera used:  Canon 10D  Geo. location:  Melrose, MA  Judge's comments:  Everything about todays choice for POTD seems to me and my un-educated eye, to be just right.  I especially liked the way Lesley has managed to "frame" the moon with the branches.  A great image that could only be captured because the camera was ready and at hand !!

A wonderful photograph of a magical scene graced with a title that genuinely tickled my sense of humour.  A moment in time captured for all of us to relish.

       Photo of the Day for Sunday, 13th April 2003 --  Carousel    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  WOW!  NOT PHILADELPHIA OR EVEN PA!  That's right! I went to Saratoga Springs last Summer to sing in a Beethoven Ninth Symphony with the Philadelphia Orchestra.  In our down time after the morning rehearsal and before the evening performance, I got to roam around Saratoga Springs.  The park there was quite nice, but it was a brilliant, sunny, hot day.  I beat the sun when I could and one place was at the Carousel House.  I took a few shoots there and chose one to do a little DA.  The colors were not very vibrant in the original shot.  After normal processing, I used the ChromaSolarize Filter from Flaming Pear.  That made the colors zing.  To give it, as Gerda would call it a "painterly effect", I used the Rough Pastels Filter in Photo Shop Elements. Some cloning was done to remove large areas of black on the floor of the carousel from ChromaSolarize Filter and I cloned some green in the mirror by the horses on the right to cover up the photographer known as RoB.  Camera used:  Fuji FP 2800  Geo. location:  Saratoga Springs, NY  Judge's comments:  Today's lesson is:   never, ever disregard a digital photograph!  Well !! .. Other than that, here's nothing I can add to it - outside of I think this is fabulous!!!  And something which is very, very different.  Terrific!!   Love it.

Camera used:  Sony DSC-F55  Geo. location:  Forks, Washington  Judge's comments:  Today's POTD is a great still life study.  I fell for the overall composition but the way all the lines seem to be able to cut across each other without causing any sort of distraction at all is something I don't remember seeing before.  It's a really stunning image.

       Photo of the Day for Friday, 25th April 2003 --  Elegant Lilies    urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  I bought these lilies on Thursday, and I've been taking at least a few pictures of them every day since then.  Now, all three flowers are fully open, and they look great.  I also found the stage we see in this picture very appealing: one of flowers open, the next  just about to open and the 3rd still some time away from opening.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Canada  Judge's comments:  A stunning image of Nature in all it's most colourful glory.  I feel Gerda has got it absolutely right with the word "elegant".  It's an elegant photograph of beautiful, elegant flowers, all elegantly presented against a background that significantly adds to the overall picture.  It's a total eye-catcher and a real treat to have as POTD.

Camera used:  Nikon Coolpix 995  Judge's comments:  Sue is absolutely correct. There's a host of different shades of yellow in her image but it's the depth of all the colours in it that catches the eye.  Then there's the way it's been framed and lit and all of it together simply makes it a very appealling image.  Another feast of floral delight for us all to enjoy.

Camera used:  Canon 10D  Geo. location:  Melrose, MA  Judge's comments:  I reckon that black and white photography is extremely difficult to get right though I have no idea why that should be: it just seems to me to be that way.  Perhaps it's because  everything  has to be right - but that's what Lesley seems to have managed.  Self-portraits are a difficult subject in any case (so I'm told!) and then to get the light and the shading correct just makes the whole thing brilliant.  Marvellous work Lesley and congratulations again.

Well framed and well constructed, it's a photograph that makes you wish you were there ...

       Photo of the Day for Saturday, 3rd May 2003 --  Taking Flight    urlLink     Photographer:  Lesley Mattuchio  Comments:  This is one deer as she is sprinting across the path and back into the forest at the Ipswich River Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary. I shot in continous mode and then merged the four images together to show her movement. It's my first attempt at photo stitching.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  Topsfield, MA  Judge's comments:  Wow!  What a great POTD this is!  This is the first time I've seen photo stitching done by anyone who I know, if I can put it that way, so a big plus there. What a clever and great technique it is!!  First of all, Lesley, you had to be there to get the photographs and I would think that anyone would be grateful just to be able to say they saw the deer run across their path but then, to be quick enough to have the camera ready and THEN to do the post-shooting work that produced this image ... I'm in awe.  I truly am.

Camera used:  Olympus C-700  Geo. location:  Gainesville, Florida  Judge's comments:  Today's POTD is a wonderful, marvellous example of Nature and Digital Art being combined to produce what is a truly sensational feast for the eyes.  I just adore it.  It really  is  one of the images that I can imagine appearing in a glossy magazine or a "Photo Book" of some sort.  Magnificent, Debbie.

       Photo of the Day for Thursday, 1st May 2003 --  A Room with a View    urlLink     Photographer:  Deborah Walmsley  Comments:  After my first set of photo's taken at this Garden Nursery, I was determined to go back and get a shot of this sphere without being able to see my reflection in it, (just everything else.)  I'm pretty sure I accomplished this, but then again, maybe I didn't.    Camera used:  Sony Cybershot DSC-F707  Date: April 28th, 2003   Judge's comments:  I really do like Deborah's photograph.  It's got so much going on in it that it keeps my eye busy all the time.  And I find myself going back to look at it's detail over and over again - and what more could a photographer ask for?  And of course, there's the additional challenge of "Spot Deborah" .. A really skilfully constructed picture.

Combined them in a bouquet.  Some unusual colors that together don't look so bad.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Robert says " ... don't look so bad."  That's one heck of an understatement for sure: they look truly wonderful!  What a glorious display of Nature's colours and textures all touched by the most gentle of lights.  The whole thing just works for me.  Congratulations, Rob.

I wasn't able to get a good focus lock on the bird, but was still pleased with the resulting image.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10d w/Canon 100-400mm lens  Geo. location:  Jarboe Park in Neptune Beach, Florida.  Judge's comments:  An exceptional photo even by Jim Carper's own high standards.  I don't know about the focus and in truth if anything is lost by that I'm not sure I can see it!!  The sparkling background really does give the impression of a magical ride on a carpet of light.

Nature at its best.  Camera used:  Olympus C-730 UZ  Geo. location:  The Netherlands  Judge's comments:  There's a definite idea of motion in Mariette's picture.  You can really  feel  the turtle swimming.  I'm guessing that it was taken in an aquarium rather than "in the wild" and from experience I know how difficult that can be so for me, that just adds to the achievement.  A really graceful photograph.

Lovely rich light absolutely everywhere your eye wanders, a wonderful background and overall, colours that are hinted at in the most subtle of ways.  And a title for the photo that says what Janet saw.  Brilliant!!

Plus, you get the idea that if the driver went just a little quicker, Murphy might ... just ... get .... that ..... next ..... cloud !!!   Great shot and congratulations Jack.

       Photo of the Day for Friday, 9th May 2003 --  After Van Gogh: Sunflowers on a Starry Night    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  I bought this really nice red vase and two large dyed red sunflowers and three small yellow.  I do not know what I was thinking when I shot and re-shot all that red. The flowers blended a bit too much into the vase. So I did a little DA.  Camera used:  Fuji FP 2800  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Where do I begin ... A "little" DA?  'Struth, Rob, it's clear from the image that it's been a lot of work to achieve this level of quality so I think you're being far too modest.  For me, you have a talent for doing the right DA thing with the right image - and this time the jewel is the title!  Cleverly done all round.  You'll know by now that this is just the thing that really appeals to me especially when it's done like this.

Camera used: Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  The Bronx Zoo  Judge's comments:  On a sort of "techie" side, the POTD today is brilliantly composed and selected and beautifully lit. The depth of field is, to my eye at least, perfect. That's that side of it:  on the other, it's, well, it's just irresistible!  What a truly cracking shot!!  It's got a real feel of the little guy saying exactly what the title Jeffrey has given it.  And if a photograph can give you that sort of feel", then it just has to be a winner.  Many, many congratulations Jeffrey.

Camera used:  Olympus c4040  Geo. location:  East 87th street, NYC  Judge's comments:  Today's POTD is indeed a Special Delivery, just as in the title!!  A very beautifully crafted photo with the brickwork especially giving it some glorious lines.  And how Margaret managed to find the colour scheme I'll never know!  Everything matches, from the colours of the flowers in the vase, to the slight tint to the bricks to the deeper hue, I suppose it is, in the pathway and the wonderfully deep contrast of the curtains in the window.  Probably the way the path falls away to the right isn't a purists way of doing things but for me, it just works absolutely sensationally.  Truly a feast for the eyes.

But this is such a beautiful picture it's irresistable.  Wouldn't you just love to nestle down amongst those trees, listen to the birds and all and doze off in the sunshine ... the height of tranquility or what?   :o)   Congratulations Kay on a magnificent POTD.

Also, the way that the stack and the rest of the building just seem to grow out of that diagonal has been very keenly observed and executed.  Add in the light and altogether it's quite breathtaking.  Black and white photography, always difficult I think, done exceptionally well.

       Photo of the Day for Saturday, 17th May 2003 --  Feedin' Time    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  Well what's this all about then! Well I had purchased the slinkies and have tried to photograph them somewhat unsuccessfully in the past.  This time I set them up with the largest against the three smaller. It's either a convergence of slinkies or some sort of abstract mammalian feeding process.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, Pa  Judge's comments:  Can't you just  feel  these Slinkies in your hands?  Feeling just like they really were alive.  Then, to see Rob's photo and his idea that they might  just  be feedin' makes the imagination run wild ... Can't you just see little Slinkies everywhere snuggling up to their Slinkie Mother for their meal in some dark, dingy, quiet Slinkie home somewhere on the planet ... Rob!!  Is this a new life form?  Is this ??... could it be ??...   First Contact!    Is this a Close Encounter of the Third Kind??  .... A wonderful construction Rob, and a wild ride of the imagination to bring it to life.  Marvellous!!

Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Judge's comments:  Beautifully composed in every respect, Gerda's POTD today powerfully demonstrates the Art of the imagination and shows that something gorgeous can be created from almost any object.  I adore the way that the flowers seem to be very gently held in what I would guess, be a final embrace for them. For me, it's a kind of salute and thank you for the pleasure they have brought.  The choice of colours for contrast is, I think, perfect and the angles and the symmetry in the photograph also make it a wonderful photograph.

I think he was waiting for the pedicure. However, it gave me the opportunity to look at his feet. Isn't he adorable ;-)  Camera used:  Olympus C-730 UZ  Geo. location:  The Netherlands  Judge's comments:  On the face of it this is another POTD featuring a zoo animal but give it a closer look and you'll see that it really is on very different theme.  In the first place, it's really well observed by Mariette and it's also a photograph that's  full  of great depth and detail, to the point that I've only just noticed that the bear is actually sound asleep!!  I think I'm developing a strong taste for pictures that can keep my eye occupied all the time and this is one of them.  Congratulations Mariette.

SS 1/45, Aperture, 5.6, ISO 100, Focal Length 270mm  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  New York  Judge's comments:   Jeffrey's winning photo is simply superb. I know that's an over-used word but when it's a true statement, what else is there to say?  This picture is remarkable in it's content and in it's fabulous quality.  It is also stunningly presented and overall there is a feeling of being privy to the conversation going on between the two animals.  Any photograph that can provoke such thoughts just has to be a winner.

Camera used:  Sony Cybershot DSC-F707  Date taken:  May 06, 2003  Judge's comments:  If I've learnt one thing in the last three month's it's that some photographs simply can't be ignored.  There's a sort of quality about them and often I can't find the right words for it.  Deborah's winner today is one of those "ignore me at your peril" pictures.  I really can imagine it on one of those "inspirational" management posters with a suitable single-word title. "Challenge" perhaps.  But above all, it's a gentle and  fun  photograph.  I think it's great and another worthy POTD for Deborah.

Gosh.....those drugs from the Sixties should have worn off by NOW, eh? :^)  Camera used:  Canon 10d w/Canon 100-400mm lens  Geo. location:  St. Augustine, Florida  Judge's comments:  A quite staggering optical illusion from Jim.  Ingenious in fact.  Hold on  ...I've just realised ....  I  think  this is an illusion ... it  is  an illusion ... isn't it?  'Struth, pass the pills someone ... I'm getting one of my headaches :o)   Congratulations Jim on again, a very different style of POTD.

       Photo of the Day for Sunday, 11th May 2003 --  Treats from the Trainer    urlLink     Photographer:  Lesley Mattuchio  Comments:  My friend teaches beginning K-9 Agility classes and I went along to photograph the first class of this session. It was great fun watching the dogs learn to manuveur the obstacles on the course. They get rewarded each time they try a new obstacle. This English Setter had just jumped on the table where in a trial they must go to during their run and assume a down-stay for 30 seconds.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  Boston, MA.  Judge's comments:  For me, the really special thing about Lesley's photograph is that she's somehow managed to capture the  pride  and the sheer delight in the face of the owner/trainer and from what is a side-on view as well.  Mind you, the setter doesn't look too bothered about what's going on!  A lovely shot and a thoroughly deserving POTD.

Camera used:  Fuji 4900z (Manual)  Geo. location:  Israel  Judge's comments:  A photograph that I feel is just wonderful to see.  The detail, particularly of the feathers of the bird, the beautiful pose that Boris has captured, the lighting in general as well as the overall depth of field is really something.  The only issue that I have with the image is - and I am in  no way  an expert, is that I'm not at all sure that this is a Blue Heron as the title suggests.  Herons, I thought, were much bigger.   Whatever, it doesn't detract in any way from what is a high quality POTD.

I was doing some photos for Ebay which is a drag to me totally.  I had this overhead work light over a white BG as it was night and our house is dark anyway inside.  So I decided  to make some use of this set-up and try some of the pretty cut flowers I just  got for Mother's Day.  This is what this one turned out like other then a bit of the ususal tweaks.  Camera used:  Sony 707  Geo. location:  Erie, MI  Judge's comments:  I know from reading the postings in the forum that Cheryl's "Splash" has featured on at least one other site as a selection for their POTD competition.  And that's no surprise to me at all because quality wins, hands down, every time. What a wonderful, staggering display of colour captured for us all to enjoy!  And a beautifully simple but eloquent title which helps set the photo in the top class.  Congratulations, Cheryl on a marvellous capture.

Camera Settings: SS 1/60, Aperture 5.6, ISO 100, Focal Length 350 mm  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  New York  Judge's comments:  Without doubt the Tiger is my favourite animal of them all.  I think they've a grace that's not matched anywhere else in the Kingdom and a serenity that seems to come with them knowing they are the best.  Even when they're doing something very ordinary, like taking a drink as in Jeffrey's photo, they are simply sensational to look at.  An ordinary moment in the day of a beautiful creature captured to make a beautiful picture.

       Photo of the Day for Wednesday, 21st May 2003 --  Eye of the Sun    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  Bought another batch of Gerberas.  I took macros of several.  This one was just about the best so far. I like the gradation of the colors radiating out from the center.  What I really like, though, is that nothing had to been done to this shot.  The only processing was resizing for submission. Hope I can do some more like that. But if not, thank goodness for Photo Shop.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  I entirely agree with Rob that the colour radiating from the centre of the flower is the eye-catcher but I also found it impossible to ignore the way the subject is apparently lit from right to left.  It's hard to believe that a photograph featuring (almost!) one colour or shade could be so strong.  A great POTD showing once again, Nature in all it's glory.

       Photo of the Day for Tuesday, 20th May 2003 --  On Tip-toes    urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Comments:  Doesn't it just look as if the seeds are standing on tip-toes?  I picked the dandelion and (veeeerrry carefully) transported it home, then plucked off all but the two seeds and took the photo.  I used black cardboard as the background but actually liked the brown color that resulted much better ... goes better with the dandelion itself I think.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  Franziska has given us a truly wonderful study to enjoy.  There's an enormous amount of detail to see and I was especially taken with the way the "feathers" on each of the seeds seem to shine against the background.  But above all else, and I'm in total agreement with Franziska, the colour is simply gorgeous:  the sepia brown really does work so well with the dandelion itself.  The extreme care she took to get the picture is reflected in the photo.

Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  Malden, MA.  Judge's comments:  A stunning display of colours and contrasts is for me, the strongest and most fetching features of Lesley's photograph.   But what really did catch my eye was the larger of the trees on the right hand side.  If that tree isn't guarding the smaller trees with their precious bloom in front of it then I don't know what's what any more!  A marvellous, imaginative and visually stunning feast for my old eyes.  Wow...

Camera used:  Nikon Coolpix 995  Geo. location:  Wellsville, PA  Judge's comments:  Sherry's winning photograph is a terrific capture.  Birds are so difficult to get in exactly the right pose but Sherry has managed it.  The colours are simply beautiful and the depth of field is great.  And a real favourite of mine is to have a title that can make an essay of the picture in a very few words and this is one of them!  The bird really  does  look like it's trying to find somewhere to hide - but in it's current surroundings, where?

Geo. location:  San Diego, CA  Judge's comments:  I know we've seen our share of flower and inanimate object photos lately, but this one deserves the POTD regardless! The color saturation and bright nature of this photo is great. Also, the framing of the flower petals is excellent.

       Goodbye, Bob!  Bob Patterson, our trustworthy Photo of the Day judge, stepped down today to pursue a break and a variety of travels throughout Europe. He will remain in his position as one of the Shutterline Photography Forums moderators. I think Bob deserves a virtual round of applause for all the work he has done here at Shutterline. He's been a great photo judge, and he's a pretty good photographer as well ;)  Starting tomorrow morning, I will resume my role as POTD judge. On an unrelated note, if you're one of those thousands of people who view the daily winner each day but don't participate in the contest -- how about trying your luck at it? Just  urlLink become a member  and then you'll be able to submit 30 photos per month to this contest.

Camera used:  Fuji FP S602  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  I don't know what worries me more - the thought of Lash lip-synching to Cat Stevens or Slinkies nesting. Imagine someone having to clean out Lash's compound and there's a dark corner that no-one's been near for years.  It's dry, full of spiders webs and the like ... you move aside a few, dried leaves and  SMACK!  in your face is a Mother Slinky!!  Protecting her young !!  You scream ... Lash hear's the noise - and comes to investigate!  Goodness, the mind just boggles at the situation!!   Oh yes, Rob's photograph.  I like it.

       Photo of the Day for Friday, 30th May 2003 --  Oooh, Baby, It's A Wild World    urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  My pal, Lash, lip-synching to an old Cat Stevens' song. Photo taken May 14, 2003 at the Jacksonville Zoo.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10d w/Canon 100-400mm lens  Geo. location:  Jacksonville, Florida  Judge's comments:  I simply cannot resist Jim's good buddy, Lash.  He's a wonder and that's for sure.  The expressions on his face - Lash that is, not Jim! - are just amazing!  And Jim, the idea that Lash would sing along to, of all things, a Cat Stevens (sorry, a Yusuf Islam!) song is just a side splitter!!  Izitso?  Personally, I reckon that just as you took the picture he was thinking "This guy's a Foreigner - and maybe tasty!!  I know, I'll wait in the Moonshadow, even until Morning has Broken - and then I'll have him."  A great, great POTD, full of fun.

       Photo of the Day for Thursday, 29th May 2003 --  Fireworks are Dandy    urlLink     Photographer:  Cheryl Tessens  Comments:  I took this shot today.When I veiwed it on my monitor I thought that it would make a fine bl/wh due to the high contrasts.I converted it to black and white using PS7.It looks like fireworks in July to me.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Holly,MI  Judge's comments:  I'm getting to be a black and white softie I believe!!  I still think though that b&w has such immense competition from colour that it needs a real beauty to stand out from the "crowd" as it were but Cheryl's dandelions are just that.  The picture itself has wonderful detail and what seems to me to be "strong" depth to it and I liked that a lot but it's Cheryl's observation that it looks like fireworks in July that made me look at it in an entirely different way.  And I really agree with that - these  are  just like sparklers !!

       Photo of the Day for Wednesday, 28th May 2003 --  Flea Market    urlLink     Photographer:  Margaret Satchell  Comments:  the flea market disguised as "antique show" appears in every parking lot in about a 5 block area.  ripe for a spontaneous photo shoot, this scene was one of a number i caught by serendipity but i thought it captured the scene pretty well.  Camera used:  Olympus c4040  Geo. location:  new york city  Judge's comments:  I really do like the tremendous amount of detail that there is in Margaret's picture because it kept me occupied for a long while just looking at it all and taking it all in.   And I took a long while to decide what the real subject of the photo is.  Finally, I've convinced myself that it's actually the chandelier on the left - the guy is pointing to the wrong one!  He's going to buy the wrong one!   The bargain is on the left!!  Quick, someone tell him!! :o)

       Photo of the Day for Tuesday, 27th May 2003 --  Circle of Life    urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Comments:  Young Blue Heron has a crab for lunch.  Camera used:  Sony DSC707  Geo. location:  Texas City, Texas  Judge's comments:  I was particularly struck by Bob's photograph in that it just seems to me to be very well constructed indeed.  The "rule of thirds" very often is exactly the right thing to do and it's been carried out brilliantly in today's POTD.  As ever though, I'm also very much taken with Bob's wonderful title for his submission. This is a picture that vividly depicts that fact that so many creatures depend on others in the food chain for survival - it  is  the Circle of Life for sure.

Judge's comments:  Today's POTD is a superb action shot which is something we don't get a lot of on Shutterline.  I just totally fell for this one from Lyn.  It's got the lot for me.  I can actually  see  the movement of the canoe through the water: I can  feel  the spray on my face:  and the tension in the muscles of the rower - I'm there with him, struggling to keep a handle on my destiny!!  And I can almost  hear  the rush of the water .... Superb, Lyn.

       Photo of the Day for Sunday, 25th May 2003 --  Under Mom's Wing    urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  I shot this picture this afternoon at Edwards Gardens.  I was so impressed with the park when we visited it on the weekend that I decided to pay it another visit today.  This time, I came across mother goose, with her mate nearby, apparently just sitting on the grass.  Then I noticed a bit of fluff peeking out from under one of her wings,  Then there was movement under her wings near the centre of her back and a couple of bits of fluff appeared there.  I kept watching and shooting and waiting, not sure of exactly what was happening, and this was one of the shots I got.  Just a couple of minutes after I shot this, the mom got up--and 7 little goslings emerged from under her.  Camera used: Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Canada  Judge's comments:  A deliciously simple shot that captures a wonderful - and I would guess, a rare moment!  I don't ever remember seeing anything like it before!!  An totally charming POTD from Gerda which just goes to show that patience is not only a virtue but for a photographer, there's often a great reward.  Makes it all worthwhile, don't you think?

       Photo of the Day for June 7, 2003 --  Wavelengths Times 2    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  On the corner of one of streets near where I work, there is a building that has burnished steel details. They run vertical about a story high and are located all around the building.  I tried another of these straight on, but I did not have my big tripod with me.  I was able to use my mini tripod against a street light and got reflections on two panels on the corner of the building.  The colors and numbers of lines change as the lights on the street change and as vehicles go by. At night nothing else is reflected in the panels but these streams of colored light.    Camera used:  Fuji FP 2800  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Creative photo, I love the contrast between the steel and the different bars of color.

       Photo of the Day for June 6, 2003 --  On the Road    urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Comments:  Taken during a one-week photo journey through  Iceland with my friend Barbara.  This is the main road (and the better part  of it) around the island.  Many roads are dirt-tracks.  I loved the wide  open areas and the fact that there doesn't seem to be a single traffic  light or barriers to the side of the road anywhere outside of  Reykjavik.  Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Iceland  Judge's comments:  Killer photo, Franziska! It's very powerful and the clear road ahead is inspiring -- seems like something Jack Kerouac would have written about. Everyone, I highly recommend that you click on the thumbnail to view the high-resolution image: this little preview image doesn't do the photo credit.

       Photo of the Day for June 5, 2003 --  Convict Lake    urlLink     Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Comments:  One of the many lakes we saw on vacation in the Eastern Sierras in California.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  California  Judge's comments:  My apologies for not posting earlier, I got awfully sidetracked today (read the forums for the full excuse... err story). This is another excellent photograph, just what I would expect from Ms. Pedersen. The framing is great, the reflection is artistic, and the rocks provide a great 'division' between land and water.   Attention!  Shutterline is currently in the evaluation process for a new Photo of the Day judge. Roughly every 3 months, we select one Shutterline member and teach them how to login to Shutterline's Administration Control Panel and post the daily photo. It's a lot of responsibility, and you have to be willing to post a new photo each day (you don't have to do it first thing in the morning, as long as you're consistent), but it's also a rewarding experience. The summer session is open right now -- from roughly June 9 to some time in late August. If you're interested, please  urlLink contact us  immediately with your full name, brief description of your photography experiences, and an explanation of why YOU deserve to be judge this time around.

       Photo of the Day for June 4, 2003 --  Little Drops of Water    urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  I liked the look of these soft, sort of curly leaves (I have no idea what the plant is), and I especially liked the little water drops on the leaves.  They were left over from a recent watering, I imagine.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:   not given!   Judge's comments:  A very nice, vivid raindrop photo. This is the kind of thing that would make an excellent wallpaper on my desktop! By the way, please don't forget to buy submission credits for the  urlLink CA$H Contest  and send in your photos... It's just like the POTD, except that the winner will receive a cool cash prize.

       Photo of the Day for June 3, 2003 --  Lake Crescent    urlLink     Photographer:  Kathy Cunningham  Comments:  No special settings.  Nature provided the lighting.  Camera used:  Sony DSC-F717  Geo. location:   not given!   Judge's comments:  An excellent photograph, I like the contrast between shore and rippling water, and the dock extending into the water adds to the composition. The foggy mountains are great, but I think this image could be even  more  powerful if you somehow got rid of the leaves at the top. Just a suggestion.

Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Iceland  Judge's comments:  Yet another POTD win for one of Franziska's Iceland photos, congratulations! I just loved how you took an ordinary object (oil drums) and gave them a unique look and feel.

       Photo of the Day for June 11, 2003 --  Going Up?    urlLink     Photographer:  Glenn Jensen  Comments:  Taken last week at El Morro National Monument  midway through a hike to the top of the monument. The monument is, for the most part, a large sandstone bluff notable for the numerous inscriptions (made by Native American, European, and U.S. individuals) located around its base. This stairway, however, was carved out of the stone after the establishment of the monument to help mark the trail and prevent hikers from slipping off the edge of the bluff.  I thought the white sandstone steps and dark storm clouds above would provide for an interesting black and white shot. I hope you agree! Camera Settings: f/8, 1/200 s, ISO 100  Camera used:  Sony DSC-F707   Geo. location:  Northwestern New Mexico  Judge's comments:  Great black&white composition, and thanks for providing such a detailed comments section for us! I particularly like how you shared the camera settings with us.

This scene is right off the side of a mountain road in Western North Carolina. The colors were magnificent to behold, and the mule adds to the contrast don't you agree?  Camera used:  Sony Cybershot F-750  Geo. location:  Trust,  NC  Judge's comments:  I do like the "contrast" between yellow and green, and the brown mule stands out well. An effective photo, congrats!

Well done!

The boats were originally designed for  moving bulk cargoes via the river but are now used almost exclusively  as pleasure cruisers.  Camera used:  Fuji 6800Z  Geo. location:  Bergerac, France  Judge's comments:  Great photo and a nice composition. The almost perfect reflection of the arches makes this a masterpiece.   Reminder!  Only ten days left to participate in the  urlLink Shutterline Cash Contest  for this month. Check it out today and purchase a few submission credits, if you haven't done so already.

I love how the little barn is still very "overpowering" in this picture.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  I agree, it's a powerful composition -- nice work.

The sun pillar was so beautiful that night. Being from Texas we had never seen one before. The flying geese provided one of our best pictures that night.  Camera used:  Olympus 200Z, D510Z  Geo. location:  Illinois  Judge's comments:  An interesting sunset photo, great colors and I have never seen a "pillar" before.

I like the views I can get from them and have tried about 4 or 5, each with no problem.  I would was just going to try some more city scapes from this venue but it was just past dusk and Seeger Park had some activity going on. I did panorama version of the scenes in the park with a back drop of the city as seen from the edge of South Philadelphia.  There are 6 shots stitched together in Pano Stitcher by Pixtra and post processed in Photo Shop Elements.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  An excellent urban panorama, I especially like the glow of the street lights with the skyscrapers in the background.

       Photo of the Day for June 15, 2003 --  Bumper Crop    urlLink     Photographer:  Glenn Jensen  Comments:  This is the Cadillac Ranch you may or may not have heard about. During the 1970's, an artist group had these ten 40's - 60's era cadillacs placed vertically in the ground on a farm outside of Amarillo as a tribute to the Cadillac tailfin and old Route 66 in general. Supposedly, they lean at the same angle as the sides of the Great Pyramids, and visitors are encouraged to add their own artwork via spraypaint. This shot was taken on Sunday afternoon in June, 2003, a few hours following a rainshower. Camera Settings: f/8, 1/800 s, ISO 100  Camera used:  Sony DSC-F707 + 0.7x wide-angle conversion lens  Geo. location:  Amarillo, TX  Judge's comments:  Very unique photograph, thanks for submitting it! I guess it's the equivalent of Stone Henge in Texas... Thanks also for the camera settings.

       Note to visitors:  You'll now notice a sponsor/advertiser toward the top of this web site. I decided to allow one banner ad on this page to increase Shutterline's revenue. Needless to say, you'll only see advertisements from reputable companies. If the company isn't offering a genuinely useful serivce, it isn't allowed to advertise here.   Right now, you'll see ads for two of America's least expensive ISPs. I feel this is useful to members because surely some of you must be unhappy with unreliable or slow Internet connections. With limited advertising like this at Shutterline, we'll (hopefully) gain the cashflow necessary to award POTW winners cash prizes on a more regular basis.

The sun got behind some of the clouds and made the reflection quite interesting.

Camera used:  Canon PS Pro90 IS  Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  I know you submitted this shot a while ago, but I really like it. Great framing and the sepia setting really does make this photo.

Camera used:  Canon S40  Geo. location:  Paris, France  Judge's comments:  A great first-time win [I believe] for Chris here at Shutterline. An interesting and moody black&white composition! By the way, Chris, next time you submit please reduce the image size a bit. I was forced to resize the image so that slow Internet users won't have to wait for the image to load.   A couple of other comments. The  urlLink Shutterline Cash Contest  for June has ended and we've posted the winning photo there. We also have a new contest running for July/August that promises to be just as fun (and it will probably have a larger cash prize this time). And finally, feel free to patronize the advertisers shown on the top of the POTD pages. They help us pay our bills now, which is always nice.

       Photo of the Day for June 30, 2003 --  Genie in the Sky    urlLink     Photographer:  Kay Prather  Comments:  After a rainy day, the sun came out and with it some beautiful clouds and a beauty of a sunset. I watched in awe as the cloud formation formed this genie in the sky. Was awesome and beautiful  Camera used:  Nikon CoolPix 995  Geo. location:  South, La  Judge's comments:  A beautiful sunset with great reflections in the water. Congrats on your win!

       Photo of the Day for June 29, 2003 --  Drink Squirt!    urlLink     Photographer:  Ron Case  Comments:  This is an old advertisement painted on the side of a long-abandoned general merchandise store in a small town in central Utah. We passed this building while on a weekend trip and I turned around to take some pictures. I remember seeing this cartoon character as a child and in drinking Squirt. I don't know if Squirt is still available - I haven't seen it anywhere for many years. Outside the picture is the price of a bottle of this soda - a nickel. Unfortunately I couldn't work the price into the composition.  Camera used:  Kodak DC3400  Geo. location:  Wellsville UT  Judge's comments:  A good, unique composition. The bricks make the texture interesting as well. In other news, today is the last full day to  urlLink participate  in the June Cash Contest.

       Photo of the Day for July 12, 2003 --  Show-Off    urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  I was very pleased with the body curve as well as "facial expression" of this flying Bottlenose Dolphin that I shot at Marineland. Photo taken July 11, 2003 using my Canon 100-400mm lens.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  Marineland, Florida  Judge's comments:  Show-off, indeed! I don't know about the facial expression there, but it very well might be a smile of some sort. Great photo, as always, Jim.   T A L E N T       S E A R C H  Do you have what it takes to pursue a fun, active, and challenging career in the exciting and high-tech field of Photo of the Day judging? Do you work well with people? Are you an excellent photographer? Just kidding about all that, but I really am searching for a POTD judge to take over for the next  3 months  effective as soon as possible. I've enjoyed judging all of your photos, but months ago (at the beginning of 2003, right?) we all collectively agreed that members should get a shot at judging the photos here. Cheryl was a great POTD judge for well over a year, Bob did a great job during his 3 months or so, and I've been filling in for a while. Time to step up to the plate. If you're interested, please  urlLink contact me . Premium Members only, please. Also, if you ask to be judge you need to be able to login each day and select/post the winning photo. If your life is too busy to work this into your schedule, please don't ask to be the judge. Thousands of people *rely* on you each day to pick a cool photo and brighten their day.

       Photo of the Day for July 11, 2003 --  Icy Wind and Waves    urlLink     Photographer:  Drake Olmstead  Comments:  Taken in South Haven Michigan this past December. It was very cold, with big waves!  Camera used:   urlLink Nikon D100   Geo. location:  South Haven, MI  Judge's comments:  A great winter photo composition, refreshing to see it (especially considering how hot it has been around the U.S. lately). Congratulations on your first win at Shutterline! Also, in every submission please include the camera used to take the shot. I'm assuming you used your D100, but some Shutterliners use multiple cameras so we ask that the camera be mentioned in every submission. Thanks.

       Photo of the Day for July 9, 2003 --  Hood Ornament    urlLink     Photographer:  Ron Case  Comments:  This is an extreme close-up of the hood ornament from a 1949 Cadillac. It was taken at a classic car show held over the July 4th weekend. I added a +7 close-up lens to my camera (which screws onto the camera lens) and shot in macro mode. When you shoot in macro mode with my camera, the focusing system is disabled and you have to physically move the camera in and out to focus on your subject. To future complicate matters, the +7 adapter gives an extremely narrow depth of field.  Camera used:   urlLink Kodak DC3400   Geo. location:  Wellsville, UT  Judge's comments:  An extremely unique and interesting still-life macro composition. Thanks for submitting it!

On another note, feedback on the larger thumbnails here has been positive -- so for now I think we'll adopt the larger thumbnail system. Also, until Friday we have a huge sale on new Shutterline  urlLink memberships . It's worth checking out if you've been thinking about joining the site for a while.

       Photo of the Day for July 7, 2003 --  Delaware River Front Fireworks    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  This is a composite of two separate shots taken on the same night.  I took over a 100 shots of the Two Cities, Two States Fireworks Extravaganza.  On my way home a tried a new parking garage to get some night shots of the river front.  I took the base photo there.  I added a firework shot to it in PS elements.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great composition, and thanks for explaining the edits you made. Also, I decided to make the thumbnails bigger for now. Does everyone like this idea?  urlLink Let me know.

I think it is a very well chosen angle to shoot from. Excellent detail and colors this way. Congrats Lyn!   Scenic  --  Golden Sunset   urlLink     Photographer:  Drake Olmstead  Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Grand Haven, Michigan - of Lake Michigan.  Judge's comments:  A great sunset and indeed a golden one. I like the diagonal lines and the silhouettes. Very good exposure and very attractive picture. Congrats Drake.

          Photos of the Day for July 18, 2003      Animals  --  Bird's Eye View   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Comments:   I was shooting Pelicans when this Seagull flew over and dropped his catch at my feet. He was hovering here wanting to come in and pick it back up before I got it.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Texas City, Texas  Judge's comments:  Another great bird shot by Bob. I like the detail and expression of the bird. I wonder why you did not pick up his catch :-) Congrats on the gull picture Bob.   Macro  --  " Lily In The Light "   urlLink     Photographer:  Lesley Mattuchio  Comments: I love to garden and in the summertime I am glued to my backyard trying to capture my flowers in every possible light and position. I like how this photo of one of my Asiatic Lilies looked with the lighting of the moment and the way the shadows fell so I got creative with it.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  Melrose, MA. USA  Judge's comments:  This Lily looks great although I must say that I think that the original - non edited version - would be good as well. But I can imagine very well how the shadows fell over this Lily and I like the editing work very much since it points out the shadows well. Congrats Lesley.

          Photos of the Day for July 17, 2003      Other  --  "Mirror Reflection"   urlLink     Photographer:  Cheryl Tessens  Comments:   I finally made it downtown to the weekly alley car cruise. As I was walking around and looking at first I spied a tire eflection.Then as I was setting myself up to take this shot I was surprised to see more.Instead I saw the entire car parked alongside this big black cadillac reflected  back at me. I had some difficulty getting this shot as the sun was shining in such a way that it was refracting off my lense causing sun spots to appear everywhere.I found an open doorway which offered my lense some protection from the rays of the sun which allowed me to capture this shot. Of all the shots that I took yesterday I think this one is the best of them all.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Holly MI  Judge's comments:  I had to look what I saw exactly and then it made me smile. An old car and a modern one reflected. I know that it is difficult to shoot something like this in the bright sun and I think you did an excellent job, especially with the 'old and new accent'. Congratulations Cheryl.   Animals  --  Jellyfish   urlLink     Photographer:  Margaret Satchell  Comments:  Jellyfish exhibited in the Boston aquarium.  When I saw the photo on my computer screen I thought it looked oddly atmospheric, like outer space.  Camera used:  Olympus c4040  Geo. location:  Boston  Judge's comments:  I think this is a great capture of a jellyfish. Lighting in an aquarium is not easy at all! Congrats with this jelly shot Margaret!

          Photos of the Day for July 16, 2003      Macro  --  Amazing Green   urlLink     Photographer:  Mary Ann Melton  Comments:  This picture was taken in my yard in some tall grass in a corner.  It  amazes me the number of varieties of grasshoppers that live here. This one is such a pretty green.  I underexposed this picture to make the grasshopper stand out and to make the background more distinctive.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D60  Geo. location:  Garden  Judge's comments:  The green of the leaves and the green of the grasshopper is really attractive. Please click on the original since the thumbnail does not show the quality of the picture. The composition is great and the detail of the animal too. Congrats Mary Ann   Scenic  --  Ubehebe Crater   urlLink     Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Comments:  This was taken in Death Valley, California during our May 2003 vacation.  The wind was blowing so hard I felt like I was going to sail right into the crater.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Death Valley  Judge's comments:  A good shot of a great location in Death Valley. I think the depth of the crater is very well captured. Congrats Janet.

          Photo of the Day for July 15, 2003       Animals  --  "Allure of The Green Mamba"   urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  Taken with my Canon 50mm 2.5 lens on July 14, 2003 at the Jacksonville Zoo. While I do not like snakes at ALL, I do find myself drawn to  photographing them every chance I get...especially  the more deadly ones, and the Green Mamba is right  up there in that category....weird, eh? :^)  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10d  Geo. location:  Jacksonville, Florida  Judge's comments:  Another great 'Jim Carper' shot. I did not know untill I looked at the names. What a stunning picture. I am actually afraid of snakes but the snake on the picture is worthwhile looking at without having to be afraid ;-) I really like the composition of the picture and the idea of movement. It feels as if the snake is coming at you while he keeps an eye on you! Great color and detail as well. Congrats Jim!

These are reflected in the Mellon Bank Building.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  I like the geometric lines and the clouds that are being reflected. Also the color of the picture is very attractive and reflects the idea of the sky pretty well.   This will be my first day and I sincerely hope I will do a good job. Anyway, I will do my best

       Photo of the Day (C Series) for July 13, 2003 --  Sunset at the Shore    urlLink     Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Camera used:  Sony DSC F505  Judge's comments:  Another impressive & colorful composition, I don't think I have ever seen you submit a bad or boring photograph here. Also, I've been thinking that maybe Mariette should just post one POTD per day. I don't want to overwhelm her with work right as she steps into the judging position, she'll quit on me! :) Then, I can login and post a second and third POTD whenever the submission volume warrants doing so. That seems to make [more] sense.

I used a 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  Fort Sewall, Marblehead, MA  Judge's comments:  Great composition, Lesley! I like how the painter's actual subject (the landscape) is right there in the background.

       Photo of the Day (A Series) for July 13, 2003 --  Fly By    urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Comments:  Found this fly while photographing flowers at a local garden.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Texas City, Texas  Judge's comments:  This is a great macro shot! From now on, Shutterline will regularly have two to three Photo of the Day images, as opposed to the current one. It just isn't fair to receive so many good submissions each day and to have only  one  appear here for the world to view. On heavy submission days (like today) we will try posting up to three images: A Series, B Series, and C Series. These are   not   to be confused with the terms first, second, and third... It is simply a means of classifying each one, so that in the  urlLink forums  we can say "Hey, Bob, great job on your A Series POTD today." In other words, all three are equally prestigious as far as we're concerned. And calling them A Series, B Series, etc sounds slightly cooler than #1, #2, and #3.   More importantly, I believe this will be my last day as POTD judge. Mariette, who is an amazing photographer and actually already runs her own popular photography site ( urlLink MyDigiShots.com ) will be taking over. I was going to let her select today's photo, but she's probably asleep by now (she lives in the Netherlands I believe, so there is a time difference of at least 8 hours. That's a total guess, so if anyone actual knows the time difference please let me know.) Congratulations to Mariette on the new judging position.

Congrats!   Inanimate  --  Sunset at Mono Lake   urlLink     Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Photographer's comments:  We camped only about 5 miles from here during our May vacation.  It was beautiful!  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Great colors and beautiful scenery. I think you did a fine job showing the depth in the landscape with the mountains. Congrats Janet, a very impressive picture.   Objects & Open  --  Screen Shot Gerbera   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  I saw this a couple of times on Better Photo and gave it a try. It was a rather hurried experiment. The lighting was OK but the set up was wrong and needs to be more sturdy. I sprayed water on a piece of one foot wide screen I bought and stood it long ways in front of the vase with a flower in it.  I tried three different flowers and this miniature gerbera worked best due to its smaller size and greater distance from the screen. I will try it again, better I hope.  I used a 1x, 2x and a 4x close up filters on the camera set at super macro mode.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Well Robert, try again and show it again, especially if you really think it will be better than this one. I think it is a great effect! I like the colors and the reflections. Congrats and... keep 'fooling around' to surprise us!

          Photos of the Day for July 25, 2003      Life  --  Little Bug ... Big Antennas    urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Photographer's comments: A tiny grasshopper, no longer than the fingernail on my small finger.  The hardest part was getting the focus right (the macro attachment makes for a rather narrow DOF) and keeping other blades of grass out of the picture.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  I love the picture, as well as the title. The animal looks pretty smal indeed and since green on green is difficult to focus at I think you did a marvellous job. Congrats!   Inanimate  --  Salt Lake LDS Temple   urlLink     Photographer:  Ron Case  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used:  Kodak DC3400   Geo. location:  Wellsville UT  Judge's comments:  Great picture of a beautiful scene. To be honest I would have straighten the horizontal line a little to make it perfect. Colors and reflection are great. Congrats Ron with this picture.   Objects & Open  --  R.C.   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Photographer's comments: Found this nostalgic scene at an antique store near Houston Texas  Camera used:  Sony DSC  Geo. location:  Texas City, Texas  Judge's comments:  I think you had a great eye to motice the yellow and the blue together with these old stuff. Very attractive picture which reflects the atmosphere of the antiques really well. Next time I would like to join you on your tours! Congrats Bob.

They let me get pretty close before they flew away. I think they are Monarchs, but I could be wrong. I know they sure are pretty.  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Great shot.

He and  his siblings had just come out of the water. They were busy shaking  themselves off and grooming. We had just had a short shower which left  the grass all covered with water drops.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D60   Geo. location:  Brushy Creek, Round Rock, Texas  Judge's comments:  Very pretty picture and good and sharp detail. Very attractive and I think we all agree that this belongs to life. Congrats Mary Ann!    Inanimate Nature  --  Beeware   urlLink     Photographer:  Jeffrey R. Bange  Photographer's comments: Shutter Speed 1/350, Aperture 6.7, ISO 100, Focal Length 50mm  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Very pretty macro of a great flower, I think it is a echinacea if I am not mistaken. The fact thet there is also a bee is great and makes the picture even better. But I focused on the flower itself.   Objects & Open  --  Tail Light   urlLink     Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Photographer's comments: A little fun in PhotoShop.  I just thought it looked interesting.

I can imagine walking by and seeing this man sitting there in the sun, nodding.    Inanimate Nature  --  Oak Alley   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Photographer's comments: Oak Alley is the main house of an antebellum sugar plantation just North of New Orleans. This beautiful plantation house is over 200 years old and the long entrance from the river is lined with 350 year old Oak trees. This "alley" was used in the movie Interview With A Vampire.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Texas City, Texas  Judge's comments:  Excellent picture. I like the road to the door which leads the eye to the house and the oaks form such a great alley, also leading the eye towards the house. Great atmosphere captured in this picture. Congrats Bob.   Objects & Open  --  Conference Room Sunset Reflection   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Photographer's comments: This is a picture of a sunset reflected on the glass of a framed picture in our conference room at work. Curiously, the business buzz word in the framed picture is FOCUS.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great colors and spotted well. I like also in this picture, like Bobs picture, the atmosphere that is being reflected. I can feel being in the room and looking out of the window. Congrats Robert.

What was I looking at? But then I realized that the animal was obviously behind some sort of a fence. Great idea. It looks very attractive and reflects the shadow idea very well. Congrats Margaret.   Macro  --  Foursome   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Photographer's comments: These yellow flowers are fairly large--much bigger than the little, tiny pink flowers I've seen that have similar skinny, spiky-looking petal.  I ran across them in Edwards Gardens park where Dermot and I went shooting yesterday.  That particular park, incidentally, is really pretty and a lot of people choose to have their wedding pictures taken there.  We ran into two wedding photo shoots there yesterday--and that was a Friday.    Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Edwards Gardens park  Judge's comments:  Great flowers Gerda. I like the green and yellow tones of the picture.

It almost looks as of there is a mirror between the two birds, except that they are not the same ;-) Shot on an excellent moment. The white of the birds is also very well exposed. Looks like a bright day but no washed out birds. Congrats Bob.   Scenic  --  Shimmering Lake   urlLink     Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Photographer's comments:  Our daughter lives near this lake and we all went for an evening stroll and the light was just wonderful.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Grand Haven, Michigan - of Lake Michigan.  Judge's comments:  Wonderful Janet. I really like the light. This picture reflects the quietness very well. I can almost hear gulls and feel a little bit of wind as I sit on a bench near this lake watching the small boat. Congrats Janet on this great picture.

Looks like the season for thee creatures! Congrats Lyn.   Inanimate  --  Ethereal Rose   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Photographer's comments:  Many of the roses I've been seeing for the past week or so seem to be showing the effects of the summer heat.  They look pretty wilted and forlorn.  A couple of weeks ago when I took this photo, though, they were really at their peak and just beautiful.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Great rose and good colors. Looks soft but is good in detail. Congrats!   Objects & Open  --  Silverware   urlLink     Photographer:  louis hartman  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used:  canon d30   Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  No comments or thoughts at all?

          Photos of the Day for August 1, 2003      Life  --  Wasp on Lilly   urlLink     Photographer:  Lisa Haskins  Photographer's comments:  Took photos of this one wasp from many different angles. Was incredible even very small changes of view completely changed the appearance of the wasp.  Camera used:  Canon 10D, 100mm macro lens   Geo. location:  Queen Beatrix Park, Amsterdam  Judge's comments:  Good detail in the wasp. Also a fine composition.   Inanimate  --  Graffiti Spider Mums   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  Well I thought they were dyed. What do I know? So I asked the florist how they did the colors and he told me they were spray painted. LOL! That's where the title is from.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great detail in this shot and thanks for the story about the picture!   Objects & Open  --  Perched   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Photographer's comments:  This beautiful Great White Egret was actually perched on the top of a Shrimp Boat mast.

          Photos of the Day for July 31, 2003      Life  --  In A Dream   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Photographer's comments:  I almost threw this photo away because it was totally skewed (I rotated about 25 degrees) and I knew I'd loose too much background to keep everything in.  But, I tried anyway, and used a very large rubber stamp to extend the (relatively even) background, then cropped and did my usual post-processing.  This is the reason why the flower stem seems to just fade away.  I'm happy with the result and glad I didn't give up on the shot :)  Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  Great picture, and good that you explain the postprocessing. I think more people should add their equipment and postprocessing so that we can also learn from eachother! That is one of the goals of the POTD ofcourse. Congrats.   Inanimate  --  Sisters Wilderness   urlLink     Photographer:  Denny McNally  Photographer's comments: Here is a shot of the hillside just after the sun went down. This was  my first night "In the woods" on a three day  backpack trip. It was  beautiful!  Camera used:  Canon D60  Geo. location:  Oregon  Judge's comments:  Great sunset! Beautiful colors and detail. Congrats!   Objects & Open  --  Buildings   urlLink     Photographer:  louis hartman  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used:  canon d30  Geo. location: NYC  Judge's comments:  Good capture, most people would have walked by these. Another idea to look at and to remember! Congrats.

          Photos of the Day for July 30, 2003      Life  --  "Big Guy Coming Through"   urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Photographer's comments:  Great Blue Heron sweeps over a pond at the "Mission of Nombre de Dios" in St. Augustine, Florida. Photo taken July 26, 2003 with Canon 100-400mm lens attached to the 10d.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10d  Geo. location:  St. Augustine, Florida  Judge's comments:  Well, what can I say. A real "Carper" picture. Congrats on this great capture and thanks for the set up.   Inanimate  --  Bowl & Beads   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Photographer's comments:  I've got a long list of "white on white" and "green on green" etc ideas in my head.  This was one of the first ones that I tried, not exactly what I started out to do because I ended up adding color, but the other ones are still on my "to do" list :)  Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Nice composition and detail. Congrats!   Objects & Open  --  Cow   urlLink     Photographer:  J. Pedersen  Photographer's comments:  What can I say?  It's just a cow.  Well, I think it's a cow.  Saw it at the County Fair.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Well.. not quite an 'open' picture but since it is in B&W I thought it would fit in here. I like the diagonal lines and the detail of the cow.

          Photos of the Day for July 29, 2003      Life  --  Caterpillar Feet   urlLink     Photographer:  Sherry March  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used:   Nikon Coolpix 995   Geo. location:  Wellsville, PA  Judge's comments:  Really great picture of these small feet. I really like the detail of these feet. Thanks for sharing this picture, I think It is pretty interesting. Congrats!   Inanimate  --  Through a Window of the Metro Station   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Photographer's comments:  What we're seeing through the window of the metro (subway) station is the upright part of Montreal's Olympic Stadium, home to the Montreal Expos.  I'm not a sports fan.  My reason for being in the stadium area the other day is that the metro stop for the satdium is also the stop for Montreal's beautiful Botanical Garden--and that's where we were headed when I looked at the window at saw this.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Good capture! Congrats on this picture.   Objects & Open  --  Round in Round II   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  I did a series of shots of this set up for an entry in the 'Round' competition on DPChallenge. This was not the entry.  This is a shot through a large slinky and a smaller slinky to a small rubber ball.   Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great shot and great idea. You are really getting into this kind of pictures. I really like the detail and the colors of the picture. Congrats!

          Photos of the Day for July 28, 2003      Life  --  Twins   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used:   Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Iceland  Judge's comments:  Yes, I think this one fits in the category 'life' quite well. I like the detail of the two lambs. But I am bit of a softie and think they are cute. Nothing more to add to it, except that I think you were almost on the ground taking this picture ;-) At least that is what I imagine now, sitting behind my desk looking at the picture. Congrats with these two lambs!   Inanimate  --  Platinum on Chain   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  The is a shot of a portion of a window display at Tiffany's. The store has three windows and they all have a similar theme. This month's is nautical.  I shot this by putting the camera on a mini tripod and setting it on the window. Also used a circular polarizer filter.  The picture was shot at night.   Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great shot, beautiful colors and detail! Congrats.   Objects & Open  --  Hungry   urlLink     Photographer:  Margaret Schmidt  Photographer's comments:  I took this picture of this leopard and wasn't happy with the background so I decided to play with it a little in photoshop, this is the out come  Camera used:  Canon 10D and Photoshop7  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Good artwork. I think it fits the picture albeit maybe a little too much 'flowerish' (haha that is my own word I guess). But great shot.

I also like the angle from where it is taken. Congrats!   Inanimate  --  Maui Morning   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Photographer's comments:  This photo was taken on Maui at a tropical plantation. The early morning mist was encompassing the volcano in the background.  Camera used:  Sony FD95  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Oh yes. Maui. You went there to get some POTD shots I guess. Well.... sigh. No kidding, I think it is a great shot with the diagonal water stream and the mountains far away with the clouds. Good colors. Congrats.   Objects & Open  --  The Open Door   urlLink     Photographer:  Mary Ann Melton  Photographer's comments:  We travelled in Europe last summer. I was fascinated with the old  churches there.  This church was in the Cotswalds in England  . I love  the honey colored stone used in the construction.  Inside the doorway  is a bouquet of flowers barely visible.  I like the imagery in this open door to a church.  Camera used:  Olympus D510Z  Geo. location:  UK  Judge's comments:  Well Mary Ann, your comment speaks for itself. You are right, when I was looking at the picture I was also wondering what was 'behind' the door. That is great in a picture, that there is something to wonder. Colors are also good. Congrats.

MA  Judge's comments:  What can I say? Excellent shot with great detail.   Inanimate  --  Centrepiece   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Photographer's comments: Nothing special about this flower.  I just thought that the gold centre looked very pretty against the dark pink, almost red, inner parts of the petals.  Camera used: Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Yes it does indeed. Good shot of a flower in my opinion and food composition.

But I really liked the colors, detail and composition of this one. Great shot.   Inanimate  --   Foggy Morning   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used: Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Texas City, Texas  Judge's comments:  Great color and indeed a foggy morning. I can hear the gulls screaming above the boat and I feel like I just woke up, staring over the lake with this boat floating there... Congrats Bob.

          Photos of the Day for August 7, 2003      Life  --  "Are YOU My Mama?"   urlLink     Photographer: jim carper  Photographer's comments:  A young Little Blue Heron grabs hold of a passing adult in search of a meal......from the way things went after this, I'm not sure this was one of its' parents....the blue adult didn't seem to have any food, and they weren't actually near a nest anyway!  Of course, it must be pretty confusing for the youngsters, since, when hatched, they are completely white, and don't change to the dark blue color of the adults for quite some time.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10d   Geo. location:  St. Augustine, Florida  Judge's comments:  Oh ehm.. well what can I say. Jim, now you really have to come up with some other birds ;-) Great shot and I really like the title of the picture. It made me smile. I also enjoyed the colors, detail and composition. Congrats Jim.   Inanimate  --   Pond Morning   urlLink     Photographer:  Sherry March  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used: Nikon Coolpix 995   Geo. location:  Wellsville, PA  Judge's comments:  Stunning detail, very pleasant colors and good angle. Congrats!   Objects & Open  --  Patriotly Bubbly   urlLink     Photographer:  Kaye Grogan  Photographer's comments:  The flowers are on a bathing suit and the flag is a pin.  I used the "particle" format in PhotoImpact to give the reflections and bubble effect.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Great idea. Good artwork. Congrats!

          Photos of the Day for August 6, 2003      Life  --  "Riley in Thought"   urlLink     Photographer: Lyn Winans  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used:  Olympus E20   Geo. location:  Minden,ON,Canada  Judge's comments:  I like the point of view from where this photo is taken. Maybe the left eye is a little dark, but that is my eye maybe ;-) Lovely shot of a lovely animal.   Inanimate  --   Green Window in Old Distillery Wall   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Photographer's comments:  Back in the 1830s, a very large distillery was established by a firm called Gooderham & Worts.  They built several buildings in an area of what is now downtown Toronto.  Up until about 10 years ago, I believe, the distillery still functioned as a distillery.  Now the area has been converted into a site where local artists and artisans sell their work--and photographers can have a ball photographing  what is said to be the best preserved set of Victorian buildings in North America.  We just visited the area for the first time today.  I'm planning to go back as soon as I can.    Camera used: Nikon CP 4500   Geo. location:  Toronto  Judge's comments:  Great color and good capture of what you saw there! I like the detail and the contrast in the photo.   Objects & Open  --  You Go Girl!!   urlLink     Photographer:  Ron Case  Photographer's comments:  My community has a small arena where various rodeo type events are held throughout the summer. I went recently to watch Team Roping. I have never tried to photograph this type of event before thinking that my little 'point & shoot' Kodak couldn't handle the conditions. I was nearly correct.  My camera doesn't have any manual override settings, so I was forced to let it make it own adjustments. I took over 100 shots that night and only about a half-dozen are usable. It was a good experience to practice panning and learning to overcome the cameras shortcomings. Although I was standing right at the edge of the arena I was still too far away to use my flash to help stop the action. The lighting was several large halogen pole lights and they were bright enough. The only setting I could change was to turn the auto-focus off and set the camera to infinity. When I did this it was much easier to frame the picture in the viewfinder and pan along. I  tried to follow either the horse or the cow. This shot was made panning the horse and its head seem to be in pretty good focus with the rest of the shot showing the motion. What did I learn from this? First, stick with it. This was about the fourth from the last shot I took. Second, not every shot has to be crystal clear and sharp. I like the way the motion is shown in this shot. Third, don't be afraid to try new things. Fourth, I need (or it is want) a new camera. Technical details: exposure 1/10 of a second. Aperture f3.8. Focal length 12.6 mm. No flash. I added a 2x teleconverter to some of the shoots including this one. Slight Photoshop Elements modifications for color correction, brightness, etc. For the most part, this is straight out of the camera.  Camera used:  Wellsville UT  Geo. location:  Kodak DC3400  Judge's comments:  I know that this does not fit into 'open' entirely since Ron pointed out that the picture is almost straight from the camera. But it is a great shot and the idea of movement is spectacular. I can almost imagine being there and hear people screaming. Congrats on this shot.

Camera used:  Canon 10d, 70-200mm   Geo. location:  Amsterdam  Judge's comments:  Another great bird shot with a lot of detail! Very good colors and background.   Inanimate  --   "Lily"   urlLink     Photographer:  Jeffrey R. Bange  Photographer's comments:  Settings: SS 1/250, Aperture 5.2, Focal Length 300mm, ISO 100 Description: This picture was taken at the Lily Pond on Pepsi's World  Headquarters property in New York which is open to the public on weekends.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D   Geo. location:  NY  Judge's comments:  Great colors on this one too. I keep repeating myself I guess. I like the composition of this flower shot and the softness.   Objects & Open  --  Cantina Window   urlLink     Photographer:  J Pedersen  Photographer's comments:  This was taken at Seaport Village in San Diego.  It's right on the harbor and has lots of shops, cafes, etc.  This photo is of a restaurant window.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  San Diego  Judge's comments:  Nice capture and a lot of people would have walked past this I think. Great colors and detail.

Inanimate  --  Natural Fire   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Photographer's comments:   like how using shallow DOF on flowers lets me highlight just specific parts.

Objects & Open  --  One Man's Treasure   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Hall  Photographer's comments:  This is a scene I shot in Deer Park Texas. It was kind of bland looking so I did some PS work on it.  Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Texas City, Texas  Judge's comments:  Nice artwork on a great picture. Would have cropped just a little on the bottom to prevent that diagonal line to make it perfect. Congrats Bob.

Congrats. Louis, maybe you can add some comments to the shots you submit?   Inanimate  --  Blue Clouds   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  Well someone saw this wonderful reflection of clouds on Graduate Hospital and just started snapping away without remembering to check the white balance and ISO from the night before. Liked the effect.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Well.. the effect is good. Glad someone noticed the colors and reflections. Congrats!

Maybe the window half a degree rotation to make it perfect? Nope, I looked for the third time now and now I don't see it anymore. Strange, but obviously an intriguing picture which you keep looking at! Congrats!

Taken at the St. Augustine, Florida, Alligator Farm on August 11, 2003 using my Canon 100-400mm lens attached to the 10d.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10d  Geo. location:  St. Augustine, Florida  Judge's comments:  Alligator farm? Hope I did not mix up pictures because I don't see an alligator but one of Jim's great white egrets ( I think it is anyway). Jim, I think I am coming over to your place to make some shots of these great birds, or at least take lessons from you how to capture these animals. Great shot again.   Inanimate  --  Rain Victim   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Photographer's comments:  I took this picture in the City Hall Square downtown a few days ago after a rain shower.

However again, border is a little bit too strong to my taste? But the atmosphere of Venice is very well captured in the picture. Congrats

Add the fact that geese don't like people too close by and I think it is a remarkable shot.

Brought the flowers home, arranged them and shot away  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  This made me smile. Lovely shot of this bunch of flowers.

They're sleeping!   urlLink     Photographer:  Mary Ann Melton  Photographer's comments:  This picture was taken at a park near my home.  This park is located  underneath a very busy interstate highway.  I followed this set of  ducklings and watched them come out of the water following their mom.  They proceeded to preen themselves and dry off. Then they curled up  together for an afternoon nap.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D60  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  So sweet!

Another great bird shot! Congrats on this beautiful shot Jim.   Inanimate  --  Nestled   urlLink     Photographer:  Cheryl Meisel   Photographer's comments:  Taken in my backyard using my infra red on my camera with a  filter.

UNcropped, Lowered KBs for the net.  Camera used:  Sony 707  Geo. location:  Erie, MI  Judge's comments:  Great shot Cheryl. I also love IR shots. It always is a special effect with those pictures.

I like the different geometric shapes.  Camera used:  Kodak DC3400  Geo. location:  Wellsville UT  Judge's comments:  Also a good capture. Indeed good shapes and very well chosen point of view. Congrats!   Objects & Open  --  Multiplication   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Photographer's comments:  These are reflections on to the inner, concave curve of a large building built of reflective material.  The angle of the building or some other factor has made some of the objects being reflected multiply in number.  So, for example, the flag, which, as far as I can remember was just one, single flag, but in the reflection, it became many.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Great shot and well seen. I also like the colors and composition of the building on the picture. Congrats.

It's  lots of fun to watch these birds that nature has so wonderfully designed for stealth and speed. I used a 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 L IS lens and I tracked the Tern with it to get this and similar shots at the Parker River National Wildlife refuge.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:  Plum Island, Newburyport, MA. , USA  Judge's comments:  Great shot of a bird in action. Perfect would have been some more space on the left where the bird is heading to, but well... we can't control everything in nature ;-) Congrats with this photo.

Inanimate  --  Another World   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Photographer's comments:  I *finally* bought a photo editing program that has a channel mixer, and of course I immediately had to try it out on one of my old (last November) infrared photos.  I switched the red and blue channel, then removed some of the red hue from the church.  Levels, resize and USM and here we are - a totally different yet recognizable world :)  Camera used:  Canon PS Pro90 IS   Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  Yes! I know how this works and it looks great! Well done and congrats!   Objects & Open  --  Wonder Wheel   urlLink     Photographer:  Margaret Satchell  Photographer's comments:  This was taken at night at Coney Island.  I used an edge accentuating filter and jazzed up the color a bit with PSE.      Camera used:  Olympus c4040  Geo. location:  Coney Island, New York  Judge's comments:  Very nice and it made me feel good, longing for a drive in this wonder wheel.

I went over to see them and photograph them.  I got to watch them  come out of the water, shake all the water off, groom themselves, and  settle down for  an afternoon nap.

He kept moving around and I kept shooting for several minutes.  This is one of the shots I took. Manual exp.; ISO 100; FL 32mm; ss 1/250, f/5.8.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  -   Judge's comments:  Great butterfly Gerda and very original like this, on the glass with that reflection. Congrats!   Inanimate  --  Almost Fluffy   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Photographer's comments:  Some sort of plant (have no idea what it is) that I saw in Iceland.  I like how the background came out almost in pencil strokes.  Now, if only I could recreate that at will!  :)  Camera used:  Nikon D100   Geo. location:  Iceland  Judge's comments:  Nice shot of indeed a fluffy plant. Congrats.

Pedersen  Photographer's comments:  -  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Yes I know, it is also life, well that is, i think that man on the bench was still alive when Janet 'shot him'. But It is also a scenery shot and a very nice one, so I decided to have it in this category instead. Congrats Janet, very nice colors and atmosphere.   Objects & Open  --  Love is in the Air   urlLink     Photographer:  Cheryl Meisel   Photographer's comments:  My first try at a new add on lens.  It was already too dark  when this shot was taken and his little wings were  going like crazy.  I didn't  think I would even get a shot at these conditions.  I left the blur on the wings  just like they were and softened this a bit because I liked the effect more.   I added some cloud effects to the BG as it just fit the photo.  All in all I  fell in love with the shot lol.  Ahhhhh Settings of :   Manual, Aperture: F2.4, ISO: 100, SS:1/15  Camera used:  Sony 707  Geo. location:  Erie, MI.

Objects & Open  --  Green Stripes and Shapes   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  Having shot away my lunch/dinner hour one day last week, I came back to the office. I looked up in the vestibule of the office and saw a fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling. I thought it interesting and took a few shots of it. When I got back to my desk, I saw the color and remembered that I had not changed the white balance from sunny. I think the color was also influenced by a warm circular polarizer filter still on the camera. I liked the color so here it is.  (f/ 2.8, 0.0025 sec., ISO 160, macro mode)  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great colors and very attractive shot. Congrats!

Those big screech owl eyes are pretty amazing. Congrats!   Inanimate  --  Raindrop   urlLink     Photographer:   Lisa Haskins  Photographer's comments:  Taken while stuck inside on a rainy day in Amsterdam.

Objects & Open  --  High Concept   urlLink     Photographer:  Margaret Satchell  Photographer's comments:  Taken at BCE place in Toronto...I was just looking for the Hockey Hall of Fame and came upon this towering corridor.  The original is in color; I thought the subject lent itself to black and white.   Camera used:  Olympus C4040   Geo. location:  Toronto, Ontario  Judge's comments:  You're right -- black & white does make this image complete. Congrats!

She is a Miniature  Schnauzer and is just shy of a year old.   She has a way of  communicating with me without words.  I felt this photo conveyed that.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Clearwater, Florida   Judge's comments:  Great photo of an amazing dog! I have a Miniature Schnauzer, too, best pet in the world with lots of personality.   Inanimate  --  Summer Sunset Reflections   urlLink     Photographer:   Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  We have had hardly any good sunsets in Philadelphia this year.  Not compared to last year. But the one on this past Tuesday was a stunner.  The reflections are in the buildings of Commerce Square. The shot was taken from the 19th floor of the office building where I work. (f/ 2.8, 1/170 sec., ISO 400, aperture priority, UV and circular polarizer filters, hand held, 07:35pm)  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great sunset cityscape, and a neat composition. Thanks for the details about how you took this shot (I was wondering if you used a polarizer for it before I read your comments!)    Objects & Open  --  Happy Barn!   urlLink     Photographer:  Ron Case  Photographer's comments:  This barn is located in Southern Idaho and is owned by a local religious leader. One day the Boy Scouts in his area got together and painted his barn for him as a 'thank you'. They couldn't resist adding their own special touch to the job. It's a delight to be driving down the street and see this barn staring back at you.  Camera used:  Kodak DC3400  Geo. location:  Wellsville, UT  Judge's comments:  A great composition, even without the funny addition to the barn and the interesting story. Congrats!

I also like the composition. However, maybe i am wrong and forgive me in that case, but I think you changed the sky. That is not a problem for me, but I think I can see some artefacts? Congrats on this picture.

There was a troop of mongolian musicians  playing...I took quite a few shots of them but liked this more informal one the best. By the way, it was very dark and I had the iso set to 800, a tribute to how clean the images are from the 10D at high speeds!  Camera used:  Canon 10D, 70-200mm  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Great colors and detail and the smole is great. Congrats.   Inanimate  --  Small People, Big Mural    urlLink     Photographer:   Robert Mann  Photographer's comments:  Philadelphia has over 2,200 murals throughout the city. This is a small portion of Meg Seligman's 2002 mural 'Visual Arts Theatre on the Avenue of the Arts' which has some passersby in it to show scale.  The mural is includes many media: painting, mosaic, sculpture just to name a few.  It depicts the arts of dance, theatre, circus, physical, costume and scene design and architecture to name a few.  Camera used:  Fuji FP S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great shot, very good colors. But I cropped the picture next to the building to left it out and it looked a little stronger? But never mind my comments, great shot!   Objects & Open  --  Lighthouse Keeper's Desk   urlLink     Photographer:  Mary Ann Melton  Photographer's comments:  While visiting the Grand Traverse Lighthouse, there were several areas  that drew my attention for photographs.  This desk with its lamp and  old typewriter seemed to have good lighting. All photography had to be  natural lighting, because flash is prohibited because it is  historically preserved.  I thought that the sepia would be in keeping  with the historical nature of the setting.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D60  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  Very nice composition and colors. Congrats on this shot, good atmosphere on this one.      Photos of the Day for August 25, 2003      Life  --  "The Visitor"   urlLink     Photographer:  jim carper  Photographer's comments:  Photo of a Wood Stork (the only stork found in the US) taken August 1, 2003 at the Alligator Farm in St. Augustine with the Canon 100-400mm lens attached to the 10d. The Wood Stork is on the Endangered Species list, but seem to be pretty plentiful here in North Florida.

It's rare to have a new member win the Photo of the Day contest on their first attempt, but Tom's submission is clearly "the right stuff" at Shutterline. Welcome and congrats!  Less importantly, thanks to everyone who has purchased cool merchandise from the  urlLink Shutterline Gear  store! Your purchase(s) help Shutterline and give us the money necessary to keep the photo contests alive and challenging. Also, I believe that Shutterline premium mousepads are on sale for a limited time.

       Photo of the Day for September 3, 2003  --  Prehistoric   urlLink     Photographer:  Shari Malin  Comments:  This is an antique Kodak camera I purchased over the weekend in Virginia.  Camera used:  Sony DSC-F717  Geo. location:  Spring Lake, NC   Judge's comments:  Amazing shot! It really captures the "prehistoric" feel of the original Kodak cameras... They're a far cry from today's high-tech looking Kodak digital cameras. Think how far photography has gone since then. Thanks for submitting it and congrats, Shari!  Unfortunately, Mariette is sick so I'll remain the photo judge until she feels up to the task. No rush whatsoever; I really enjoy picking a winner out of the pool each day. Get well soon, Mariette! :)

It's been fun being your temporary judge, but I think we all agree it will be good to get Mariette back over here. She has a great eye for photographic talent!

We  spotted these turkeys. We came back around with me and my tripod braced  on the window of the Jeep.  I got about 4 or 5 pictures before she  crossed the road with her babies.  Camera used:  Canon EOS D60  Geo. location:  A roadside in Michigan  Judge's comments:  An excellent photo of this turkey family! You should submit something similar again around Thanksgiving time. :)   Holiday cutback:  Since Mariette is out of town and since I'm doing stuff with the family (not the turkey family lol) there will be only one photo posted per day until Mariette gets back and settled. Thanks for your understanding. (Incidentally, a lot of Shutterline's U.S. members are also taking it easy for the Labor Day holiday)

I realize this submission is kind of old (submitted on the 3rd), but I've been saving it for the right time. By the way, feel free to submit portrait or candid shots to the site -- I think some of us want to see something new.

       Shutterline's 9/11 Tribute   urlLink    Taken by one of Shutterline's members,  Franziska Lang . She is well known here for her excellent photos, and she's the one who volunteers and runs the weekly photo polls for us. Franziska is currently  urlLink selling this print  and donating all of her profits (for this month) to the Red Cross. I think it's a pretty altruistic thing to do, so I've decided to feature it here for the world to see. Please consider buying her print.

I climbed into the lifeguard station, propped my camera on the frame of the station and shot this as a 30 second exposure.  If you notice, the waves are not visible, they look soft, but in such darkness, I had to go for a long exposure.  This beach has a sunset celebration every night!  2 hours before and 2 hours after sunset, every night, weather permitting.  They have playgrounds, etc.  This is a shot of the pier itself.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Clearwater, FL  Judge's comments:  Great photo and reflections, and an interesting story about the beach. Congrats!

Camera used:  Canon EOS D30 300 f2.8 + 2x converter (960mm lens)  Geo. location:  Gurnard Isle of Wight, England  Judge's comments:  Extraordinary photograph, congrats on your first win here! I know some of you are probably sick of seeing sailing/sunset photos for this week, but this submission was just a perfect composition. Dinghy sailboat racing is a lot of fun, and this photo conveys that quite well.   In other important news,  urlLink iPads.com  is now sponsoring the Shutterline  Photo of the Month . Here's how it works: you win the Photo of the Day here, and thousands of visitors (literally) view your photo and admire your work. By winning the daily photo contest, you are automatically entered in our weekly Photo of the Week vote. Members and visitors like yourself vote on a winner. Then, at the end of September, visitors vote on their favorite weekly winner. The image with the most qualified/unique votes becomes the Photo of the Month. It's a pretty prestigious thing, since so many people will be viewing your work. And, thanks to the generous iPads sponsorship agreement, the monthly winner will receive a  $75 gift certificate  from them. Their site allows you to upload your photos and custom text to create personalized greeting cards, notebooks, etc. Please  visit their site  and buy something (tell 'em Shutterline sent you) so they realize that sponsoring Shutterline was the right choice. If all goes well, iPads is fully ready to offer this (or an even better prize) each month to the winner.

       Photo of the Day for September 8, 2003  --  Day's End   urlLink     Photographer:  Matt Welch  Comments:  20 second exposure of the Golden Gate at sunset.  It was actually darker than this shot would imply, but the long exposure lightened up the sky.  Pleasingly, I think.  I love the pink clouds reflecting the below-the-horizon sunlight.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D with Sigma 15mm fish lens  Geo. location:  CA  Judge's comments:  Another great shot, Matt! It's fairly uncommon for a new member to get two wins in the same week, so congrats on that and on the excellent composition.

       Photo of the Day for September 18, 2003   urlLink     Photographer:  Julia Mazza  Comments:  This is a shot of my best friend in the entire world.  She is more like my sister than a friend.  We've known each other since we were teenagers.  We've had children together and somehow always managed to keep in touch over the years.  Today she came over after getting her hair done.  She wanted some photos to send to her hubby who is out of the country right now.  This was my favorite.  She is as beautiful inside as she is on the outside!  My best friend Lori.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Clearwater, FL  Judge's comments:  I didn't realize you were also such a good portrait photographer! Congrats on your win, and congrats to your friend who will now become "famous" as thousands of Shutterline visitors log in this evening to view the winner.    Hurricane heads for Shutterline:  So far no flooding, just a lot of downed trees and rain. Power has gone out several times, but each time the backup seems to come on within a few minutes. If power does get knocked out, there may be a delay posting tomorrow's photo. Hopefully not though.

       Photo of the Day for September 16, 2003  --  Up, Up and Away!   urlLink     Photographer:  Bob Patterson  Comments:  One of the events at Leeds Castle which is near here is an annual Balloon and Bentley event where hot air balloons are matched with a vintage car -  a Bentley where possible - with the idea that the balloons take off persued by their partner cars and the first crew back to the Castle in the car are the winners.  The balloons take off twice a day, very early in the morning and very last thing at night - apparently they are the best times to do it. This was taken as all the balloons set off at one go and it really was a tremendous sight.  As a test of the skill of the pilot, some balloons will try and gently touch the basket down on the surface of the Castle's moat ...!!  Camera used:  Fuji FP6800Z  Geo. location:  Leeds Castle, Kent, UK  Judge's comments:  Amazing photo for what sounds like a pretty amazing event. Thanks for submitting, Bob!

It's a very pretty and colourful little town, and it's also very significant historically.  It was the port from which most Irish immigrants sailed to North America, and it's also the last port the Titanic put in at before sinking.  There are various mementos (statues, pub names, etc.) quite near the docks in the town recalling both those facts.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 4500  Geo. location:  Cork, Ireland  Judge's comments:  Great shot, Gerda. You've taken a lot of impressive shots from your overseas vacation, this is no exception.

       Photo of the Day for October 19, 2003  --  The Sun, the Mountains, and the Weeds   urlLink     Photographer:  Ron Case  Comments:  I saw this scene as I was driving home Friday night. It was approaching sunset and I liked the way the strong backlighting of the sun highlighted the weeds. I took this shot at an angle to the sun so I could capture some detail in the feathering of the weeds. I was also trying to get the mountains in the background.  I ran Color Variations in PE2 to increase the reds and decrease the blues, which more closely represented what I actually saw. No cropping or other processing done. F6.7 aperture, 12.6 focal length, 1/360 sec. exposure  Camera used:  Kodak DC3400  Geo. location:  Wellsville UT  Judge's comments:  Great shot with lovely detail. I can feel the warmth of the sun here!

First of all the shot is good and secondly, it was well chosen for this postprocessing work.  Well done, great effect.

He didn't realize how much the temperature had dropped until it was time to leave, and it was then when he felt the cold set in.  I must say, he was a real trooper not allowing this to get in the way of stopping for ice cream on our way home.

The lampposts are original.  Just imagining the effort and organization it took to move this bridge from London to here makes this a true marvel.  The lighting at night and the beautiful reflections make it a great place to visit and linger  Camera used:  Canon EOS D60  Geo. location:  -  Judge's comments:  No comments given on this one by the photographer. That is a pity, because it is always fun to hear the thoughts behind the image. It is a lovely shot. I love the long exposure time although you can see that there was some wind (flag). But it is a great picture.

       Photo of the Day for November 19, 2003  --  Intruder Alert!!   urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  This Great Egret was not at all happy to see someone walking their dog without a leash along the riverbank, and he took to the skies to let everybody within earshot know exactly how he felt. With a brisk wind, he was practically just floating in air while I fired off several shots that I was very happy to get.  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10d   Geo. location:  Mayport, Florida  Judge's comments:  Sigh. Another bird shot..... But what kind of bird shot! What a great shot Jim. The detail and color and the action in this one. Congrats!

He ran before me and I took this incredible shot.  Only, the sky was washed out.  I replaced it from another sky I had shot a few days earlier and got that stunning surreal feel.  Camera used:  Nikon CP 5700  Geo. location:  Montreal, Canada  Judge's comments:  What a great montage. You are right, it feels as if your son is about to enter another world. Great effect and well executed. Congrats!

But hey! It is a stuffed animal so..... Great idea and very nice colors :-)

I like the way he almost touched the water with his wing. The space at the right side of the bird is also great, it leaves him some space to fly to. Great detail and color Jim.

       Photo of the Day for December 1, 2003  --  A Furtive Glance   urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  Visiting family for Thanksgiving in Georgia, so no birding opportunities over the last few days, so here's a shot I took of my daughter wearing one of my hats, and it's quite obvious, I think, that she's as photogenic as any bird one might come across anyway. :^) Photo taken November 28, 2003 with my Canon 28-135mm lens attached to the 10d.  Camera used:  Canon 10D  Geo. location:  Lake Park, Georgia  Judge's comments:  Great shot. If I would be super critical, I might have chosen for one 'whole' eye and the other covered by the hat. But there is enough light in the eye. The sun on the hair is also very nice, gives a 'warm' effect. The diagonal line in the picture is very pleasing.

I decided to go for the sepia tone and add a bit of grain to  enhance the "age" of the image.  I love antiques and this shot made me  think of things old and long forgotten.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Orlando, FL  Judge's comments:  Lovely atmosphere. I think the sepia is well chosen and the extra grain makes it look a little older. Well done. Congrats. The fact that the lines are not really straight is not a real problem in this picture, since it is old :-) I like the angle from where you shoot from, maybe I would have left a little more space on the right?

We had just exited the Oregon Caves and began walking down the long pathway to the lodge when these two beautiful deer came wandering along, grazing on the grass and leaves. They didn't seem too startled and didn't run but the lighting wasn't great and I didn't have my tripod so I was disappointed when I discovered the one deer's head was slightly oof. I used the buzz filter and it helped save my photo  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:   Judge's comments:  Lovely shot Terry.

But I found the image on the ball very attractive. A nice combination. Also great that the photographer is not visible (not that I would not want to see Jim, but on some images you see 'unwanted' reflections). You should click for the larger image, so that you can see the reflection of the river.

I spent two hours walking (and sliding) around the park. It was amazingly beautiful with the trees were covered with thick coats of ice. The parking lot, walkways and even the grassy areas were coated with ice too and it was extremely difficult to walk without falling. I was interviewed by a newspaper reporter who was doing a report about why people were out at the park on such a bitter cold day  Camera used:  Canon EOS 10D  Geo. location:   Judge's comments:  Great shot with lovely colors. Congrats!

       Photo of the Day for January 9, 2004  --  Homeless in Shadows of Family   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  I took a walk at lunch today thinking I would try to get to a church that I can see in the distance from my office.  I never quite got there.  Along the Parkway, there are two statues of families. I shot one and when looking for a title or artist information around the back of the statue, I saw someone come out from under a quilt along the wall behind the statue. I did not want to disturb the person or anyone else as there were other bundles of quilts along the wall there so  I went to the the other statue. I think they are positioned there so they cannot be seen from the street by passing police.  I had to take the picture and I hope it came out OK but I couldn't take anymore immediately afterwards. I just was not in the mood.   I like the poignancy of the picture of the shadows of the family in the statue on the wall by the bundle of a person....they seem to be be protecting or keeping watch over him or her.   (f/ 3.2, 1/125 sec., EB + 1/3, ISO 160, warm circular polarizer and UV filters, hand held, 04:11 pm)  Camera used:  Fuji FinePix S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Great shot. Congrats on the 'two in a row'. That can happen because I just look at the pictures and search for the photographer afterwards. I also liked the combination of the shadows and the person on the left. It makes you wonder.

       Photo of the Day for January 15, 2004  --  Mirror Drops Pink   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  I wanted to do a new reflective drop shot.  Based on what I had read, I had bought some RainX to use to treat the glass so that the water drops bead up nicely. Then I got lazy and thought my lighting wound not be any good so I let it go.  I was cruising the picture sights and saw that everyone seemed to be doing the standard drop reflection through a piece of glass and over some object.  I had to think of something different so I came up with this idea.  I treated a mirror with RainX (by the way....the stuff works GREAT!!!) and set it on my black velvet.  I set the gerbera daisy over the mirror...it was place on a higher lever so that most of the daisy was standing on and above the mirror and not directly on it.  I used any eye dropper to place some beads of water on a diagonal from the daisy.  The shot was lit with a single clamp  lamp with a 60 watt Reveal light bulb at the corner of the diagonal of the beads of water on the mirror.  I had some problems with errant light reflections but they were expunged from the image in post processing.  Later shots of the several series I took have not lights in the image but a lot of noise developed because of the low lighting used. I experiement some with the light and found that a sheet of black poster board place over the light got rid of the errant reflections.   That's about it.....hope you like it! (f/ 11.3, 1.7 seconds, EB + 2/3, ISO 160, tripod mounted, 1x, 2x, 4x and 10x closeup filters on camera in super macro mode, 12:23am)  Camera used:  Fuji FP S 602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  well.. here is one of robert's lessons again. I think it is great that you not only share your lovely pictures with us, but also are kind enough to share your knowlegde with us. congrats on a lovely picture.

This woman with yellow shoes was walking (briskly) down the opposite platform--her motion blur was quite by accident as a result of the low lighting and longish shutter speed.        Camera used:  Olympus c4040  Geo. location:  Paris  Judge's comments:  You are honest with your remark about the motion, but that is exactly what I liked in this picture. The static letters and the moving girl. Congrats

Maybe for a next time, try to get some more space below and above the bird. Give it a little more space and try to capture the whole shadow and see if that works out even better.

It was a beautiful day with medium to high surf on Sunset Beach.  I used my Canon 100-400 L IS lens hand-held on shore to catch this and other action taking place more than a quarter of a mile out.  When you consider that with the digital, the 400 mm is equal to a 640 mm on a 35 mm body hand-held, I have a lot of respect for this lens.  Camera used:  Canon EOS Digital Rebel  Geo. location:  Sunset Beach, Oahu, Hawaii  Judge's comments:  Lovely action shot. I can almost hear the waves and the sea. Wish I was there!

       Photo of the Day for March 11, 2004  --  Balancing Act   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Comments:  At first I tried to position the camera to get full separation between Woody and his shadow but then I realized he was probably holding on for support to be able to balance on my wobbly table :) Image was slightly cropped, toned, auto-processed, clarify applied (this gives it that hint of a halo around Woody and his shadow), then resized and USM applied.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  Lovely executed shot with the shadow touching Woody. I really like the idea. It almost seems as if the shadow runs away! Maybe a very small tilt so that the line of the table is straight? It is not disturbing at all, I just noticed. Congrats!

'Well.. that chocolate rabbit would do' :-) Anyway... the shot is nice but ....  never  give a dog chocolate, since it will cause heart problems and can cause detah very very rapidly in dogs!

       Photo of the Day for April 4, 2004  --  Spring on Van Pelt Street   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  Did I ever tell you that Van Pelt Street is lined with Lingham Cherry Trees in Spring?  Guess I forgot. Well it is and it accentuates the street rather nicely, I think. Shame the blossom last to short a time but I was fortunate enough to get it this past week.  The sky was buildings in the distance that seem to crowd the little street in, so it was replaced. I removed an air conditioner from one of the windows as well.  The entire image was processed normally and then given a slight buzz simplifier no. 1.  Camera used:  Fuji Fine Pix S602Z  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Lovely shot, with nice colors. I bet the original was good as well, but the post processing makes it almost a painting.

         Photo of the Day for May 6, 2004  --  18th Street North   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  I wanted to take a shot that has both the Arch Street Presbyterian Church and the Cathedral of Sts.  Peter and Paul in it.....they both have great domes and the only possbile shot is lacking of one or the other. I did manage to take this one that shows the front facades of each up 18th St.  The cathedral is the further of the two. I also like this one because of the many architectural styles running through the image. In the original image a power line was running along the fronts of all the buildings up to the catherdral...it and the several street lights from which it was hung were removed from the final image. ( f/ 6.3, 1/400 sec., ISO-50, aperture priority, 04:52 PM)  Camera used:  Olympus C750UZ  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA   Judge's comments:  Well seen.

         Photo of the Day for May 29, 2004  --  Clasped   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  Our Harbourfront in Toronto is currently undergoing a major renovation, so there isn't very much of interest to see and shoot there for the time being--except, of course, for the water fowl and the boats and mooring things.  This is a bit of mooring chain.  Fortunately, I really enjoy shooting chains and cables. Aperture priority, f/5.0, ss 1/100, ISO 100.  Camera used:  Minolta DiMage A1  Geo. location:   Judge's comments:  Nice image with a lot of detail. Well chosen angle! Congrats.

         Photo of the Day for May 25, 2004  --  Daisy Delight   urlLink     Photographer:  Franziska Lang  Comments:  Shot with very shallow DOF to "lift out" the top flower from the rest of the photo. First I edited out the stem of the flower lying on the ground, then did some slight curve adjustments. Since the image was fairly monochrome I then converted to grayscale and toned with a warm orange. Next, resized, applied USM and then loosely selected the top flower, inverted selection and applied a soft focus filter to the remainder of the image.  Camera used:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  Virginia  Judge's comments:  Lovely image, great idea and well executed. I like the fact that the flower is completely sharp, and not only a part. Well done, congratulations!

         Photo of the Day for June 5, 2004  --  Off With Their Heads   urlLink     Photographer:  Jim Carper  Comments:  Something about the look of this Great Egret put me in the mind of the Queen of Hearts. Photo taken April 28, 2004 at the Alligator Farm with my Canon 100-400mm lens attached to the 10d.  Digital camera:  Canon EOS 10d  Geo. location:  St. Augustine, Florida  Judge's comments:  What I like in this image is the great composition with the elegant head and neck on the right of the image, and the wonderfull feathers of this egret on the left. And ofcourse the details of the feathers of this bird. I think it is a great bird portrait. Keeps your eye moving within the image from the head towards the rest of the bird on the left. Congrats Jim.

The detail in the petals is extraordinary. Congrats Blake.

         Photo of the Day for June 3, 2004  --  Distorted Reflections of City Hall   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  Been shooting with the new camera all week and got this yesterday.  The zoom gave the ability get this better than I have been able to prior cause I could get a better angle on the distortions from farther away. The image is reflections of City Hall tower in the face of the PNC Bank building. ( f/ 3.5, 1/800 sec., ISO-100 ( and I can pick 50 & 100 ISO now! YEAH!) manual setting, hand held, 04:26 PM)  Digital camera:  Olympus C750  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  I really like this image. The reflection of the clock is great, gives you something to wonder because the clock does not indicate 4.26 as time of shooting :-) The different reflection on the left side and right side is very well spotted. Because let's not forget.... something needs to be spotted first before a shot can be taken. And it is always easy to discuss a picture after that very moment. Anyway, I think this is an excellent reflection shot, bright and very clear and with enough to see. The lines of the building take your eye right through the image. Well done!

         Photo of the Day for June 2, 2004  --  Descending Through Clouds   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  A district in the east end of Toronto is called The Beaches.  The name applies to the whole area, which is home to some trendy but very nice restaurants, as well as lots of interesting homes--and, of course, a long stretch of beach at the lakefront.  Yesterday, we went for a phototaking walk on the beach (neither of us swims, and it was much too cold for swimming, anyway), and enjoyed watching the water and the families with kids and dogs.  I also got fascinated by this kite that a young boy was in the process of bringing back down and took several shots of it.  This is my favourite of them.  Digital camera:  Minolta DiMage A1 aperture priority; ISO 100; f/6.3, ss 1/800  Geo. location:  The Beaches, Toronto  Judge's comments:  Lovely bright and clear image. The sky came out very well. It is not always easy to shoot a colorful item against a bright sky! Well done and congrats!

Manual priority mode, manual exposure, f8 @ 1/1250 sec, iso 100, cloudy WB.  Digital camera:  Minolta A1  Geo. location:  Wellsville UT  Judge's comments:  Very nice and clear image. I can smell grains, sunflower or whatever can be in these silos. I bet it stored other stuff, but it remembered me of old days when I had to estimate how much grains, rapeseed etc was stored in silos. Nice shot with good sky.

         Photo of the Day for June 10, 2004  --  3 Gerbera    urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  I shot this for the Three Challenge on Digital Photo Challenge and got my best finish yet. No ribbon, but a little closer. I wanted to get a vertical presentation that filled the frame, somewhat. I banded the daisy stalks together and arranged them as best I could. The lighting was from two 100w halogen bulbs on either side of the flowers. The lights were behind two translucent lite discs to cut down the harshness. A third reflective lite disc was held in front of the flowers during the shooting to even out the light. (f/ 8.0, 0.77 second, ISO-50, tripod mounted, macro mode, 09:30PM)  Digital camera:  Olympus C-750 UZ  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  Lovely image with great detail. clarity and color!

         Photo of the Day for June 9, 2004  --  Abstract Illusion in Black and White   urlLink     Photographer:  Gerda Grice  Comments:  This is a picture of a downtown office building.  I've always enjoyed looking at architectural feature that looks like a jagged tear in the side of the building.  I deliberately used an odd angle to take the picture from, but I didn't realize that the way the light was hitting the building would create a kind of 3-dimensional effect on the side facing me.  That was a nice bonus, and when I was playing around with the image in PS, I realized that black and white could heighten the effect.  Digital camera:  Minolta DiMage A1, Aperture priority; ISO 100, f/3.5, ss 1/320  Geo. location:   Judge's comments:  Pfeew.... another image where we can really look at twice or even more! Indeed a strange effect what you captured here! The diagonal lines indeed add to the image. Congrats!

         Photo of the Day for June 21, 2004  --  Sunny Bouquet   urlLink     Photographer:  Robert Mann  Comments:  A bouquet from church. Regular processing of picture. Made two layers. One layer in smart blur edges only and then poster edges to accentuate the lines. Another layer in Buzz simplifier no.1. I get a bit hazy here....I think I reversed the layers at some point to get the effect I wanted so the smart blur was on top. Changed the blending mode to soft light and merged down.  (I think).  Digital camera:  Olympus C-750 UZ  Geo. location:  Philadelphia, PA  Judge's comments:  This is so colorful. I really like it. The composition with the two yellow flowers is also very attractive. I like the effect, but I bet that this picture is great in the unedited form as well.

The horse head is just a section - it is a wonderful work by Guido Rosa depicting Joan of Arc upon her steed and was commissioned for a holiday card in 1926.  Mr. Rosa gave this to my husband and me for a wedding gift in 1966.  I used my Nikon D100, handheld, standing on the bed and angled to avoid a reflection of the flash.  I have titled this "Farewell, Mr. Brando".  Digital camera:  Nikon D100  Geo. location:  --  Judge's comments:  Very fitting. Congrats on your win.

         Photo of the Day for July 1, 2004  --  Cape Meares Lighthouse 1   urlLink     Photographer:  Kathy Cunningham      Comments:  This was taken a couple of years ago with my old Sony DSC-F55.  I had reason recently to "dust' it off and work it over.  I cropped and did some cloning with PhotoShop to remove distracting elements.  The pencil drawing effect was done with MS PictureIt and the Frame was done with PhotoImpact.  The gallery I am affiliated with is featuring lighthouses in a special exhibition so this was one of the older ones I worked over recently.  Digital camera:  Sony DSC-F55  Geo. location:   Judge's comments:  Lovely image and I like the postprocessing. It fits the image and creates a nice atmosphere.

I put one on the turntable and was surprised at just how warm the sound was compared to modern cds. I tried to evoke this warmth in the image.  Digital camera:  Olympus c-8080wz  Geo. location:   Judge's comments:  I think you succeeded in your attempt. I like the atmosphere you created here. Unbelievable really that these turntables are almost 'antique'.... Makes me feel old.

I have shot this type of reflection shot several times using a fruit salad cart. I switched to another cart on the opposite corner this past week and got some new views in the the rear door of the cart that I liked.  This is one of them.

         Photo of the Day for July 9, 2004  --  Coo-Coo Bug   urlLink     Photographer:  Fax Sinclair  Comments:  I had taken some pictures of these Hoverflys before but Terry Cervi's Mellow Yellow win inspired me to get up closer on these crazy insects.  Didn't get a good angle on the graphic yellow and black tail (I'm a wing nut) but there is just so much going on with this little creature!  How is this a survival advantage?  The birds just think "Man, he's too busy to eat!"  Digital camera:  Nikon Coolpix 8700  Geo. location:  Honaunau, Hawaii  Judge's comments:  Hey, I don't even like bugs, but this image is technically impressive. Very sharp and good use of DOF, also nice contrast in colors. Congrats!

I normally don't do this, in the spirit of competition and all, but I am going to link to two other shots I really like to show "fireworks across America" on Shutterline:  urlLink From Grand Prairie, TX  by  Lori Otto   urlLink From Round Rock, TX  by  Mary Ann Melton  (Texans must put a lot of money toward fireworks or something.

Sorry I do not have the settings with me. I shot this hand held in macro > mode. I do know the shutter speed was on 1/6 second so I am quite happy that this turned out.  Digital camera:   Fuji FinePix S602Z  Geo. location:   Dublin, Ireland  Judge's comments:  Lovely shot although I do not like Guinness. I like the colors and the general idea. Although the background is white you can really see that the bottles are standing firmly on the shelf because of the shadows. Sometimes a white background makes items 'fly' but that is not the case here.
