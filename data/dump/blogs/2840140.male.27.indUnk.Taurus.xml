      Well the pics from the trip will take a bit longer to post as tomorrow is  major deadline and I am currently/will be swamped with work. Some work left over from the week that I was gone and some piling on since then.  Oh well such is life.  This weekend I went home to celebrate my Mom's birthday and jsut trying to catch up on sleep that I missed.

      Well today is the last day and in a few short hours I return back to frigid Canada.  Last night was eventful, there was a huge storm that blew in from the Pacific carrying with it strong wind and torential rain.  Essentially that, the one guy in the bunk above me that snored and a whacko we had in our room kept our little aussie posse up till 3 or 4ish.  The only thing that got us to fall back a sleep is a pass around bottle of Captain Morgan, Yarrrrrr!!.  Now I pack and fly away ... it was fun.

      Well second last day here.l  The Board meeting was good, although we lost another Canadian, Visioning Session was ok.  Travelling around was amazing.  Today I rented a bike went in to the Marin Hills and had a thrill of a ride, however I also got a flat tire.  Thankfully I was rescued by my friend Yev and Martha.  Story will follow.  Tonight there is a huge storm coming so I will probably just hang out at the hostel and read, tomorrow twin peaks and the Castro dristrict before heading back to Canada.  San Fran I will definately have to visit again.  Anyhoo cheerio.  Oh and Ausies are cool, it wouldn't be a complete trip unless I ran in to one of them, well in the hostel room i have 5 of them, cheerio mate.

      Hi all.  Well I am having a blast.  But I am running really low on sleep.  The flight was uneventful long about 5 hours.  When I touched down I managed to get in to San Fran but then I got lost in the horrific public transport.  The highlight of my day was hiking out on the golden gate bridge ... wow.  Anyhow I have less than a minute to post this.  Cheerio will post from Berkley.

                 Well its about 5 hours before I leave and I am still packing.  A little snag this afternoon meant my schedule got all twisted around and I ended up typing minutes for three hours.  And the biggest kicker is that I spent alto of time getting all the things printed out as I lack a printer at home and the one email that I was waiting for came in an email I didn't check till I was at home ... and now I have some writing to do.... Grrrr....  Anyhow hopefully I can do some updates over the next week from San Francisco ... now I was being naive and I though California must be warm weather ... But the forecast calls for rain all week.  And the email warning I got says ...     "I just remember my parents (east coasters) coming to san Francisco for the first time, in shorts and t-shirts in July, and hating it b/c it was way cooler than they expected. They bought hooded sweaters and eventually fled and drove down to southern California..."   Anyhow I am off ...

      Well this week has been a bit of a blur.  I can't actually believe that it is Friday ... It is Friday right?  There were a couple of exciting events.    Tuesday I went to Toronto to visit friends.  While there I had lunch in place I have long walked by.  Trinity Square just outside the west doors of the Eaton Center is a public square where people come to enjoy the lunch hour especially during the summer.  That is where I spent some of my lunch hours when I worked downtown a year or so a go.  But there is also a church there built in the middle of the 19th century.  And the church runs the Trinity Square cafe.  It has the feel of a homey kitchen.  And it also has relatively cheap soup and sandwiches.  Probably the best thing to it is beyond the two doors there is the bustling city but it the cafe you can sit and contemplate life its nice and quiet (relatively).  My recommendation for anyone.  The other great thing that the The Church of the Holy Trinity runs besides the cafe is the  urlLink Trinity Square Park Labyrinth .  In the summer time they have a labyrinth in the park and it is amazingly peaceful to walk the labyrinth.  On the point of walking the Labyrinth I will speak later ...  Five more days to San Francisco =)

      So I have managed to fix things. When I first published the page some people kept seeing the bar on the left all squeezed. Well I sunk my morning in to trying to fix it. And I learned that you generally try the tougher approach before you open your eyes and see the simple route. Needless to say it hit me later in the afternoon and it looks just fine now.   My only beef is people who use really low resolutions. Pooehy, designing web pages such that they are viewable by both groups is tough. You either get lots of white space around it or its squished in to a little box. So the last thing I say is this site is optimized for 1024 x 768 (best if you have something higher 1600 x 1200 is my fav).

      Well here is my first post.  I generally spend more time working on the  urlLink WCRI web page  and have very little time left over for my own web page.  As such it generally went through a couple of crappy reincarnations over several months.  I like the current design and it was kind of fun designing it.  It is my first foray in to Blogging so be patient as I am getting the hang of things.  The biggest frustration is adding the comments that took quite a bit so I am still working out the wrinkles in that.  The next thing will be to work on the archive part of the page and at the same time I need to change over the Photo Gallery page which at this present time is in the old format.  But anyhow enjoy ...

      I have been down recently and I couldn't figure out why.  It seemed like a lost purpose.  I think I may have finally figured it out.  There is a lot of things happening at the co-op.  But I think I have forgot the joy of the co-op and the joy of working there.  Forgot but not lost ...   There is so much negativity in the world and so much strife sometimes it is hard to see the joy and the hope there is in life.  So I will start looking again.    So I took the advice of a friend and I rented the movie  urlLink Under The Tuscan Sun  and it was one of the sweetest movies I have seen in a bit.  And it comes with my recommendation.

      Well this weekend was much needed.  A chance to get away from the co-op and refocus.  But anyhow the post is about a movie I saw.  The movie is called Long Life, Happiness, and Prosperity and it is a little Canadian film but it was absolutely amazing, and I strongly recommend it to everyone.    The premise of the movie is: "In " urlLink Long Life, Happiness & Prosperity ," twelve-year old Mindy Ho (Valerie Tian) tries Taoist magic to fix her single mother's (Sandra Oh) financial situation and seemingly hopeless romantic prospects. Mindy's misdirected charms appear to cause an aging security guard to lose his job and a local butcher to win the lottery. The guard, the butcher and her mother's stories all intersect, bound together by Mindy's attempts at magic intervention"

      Today marked the one year anniversary of the war in Iraq and once again millions of people around the world took to the streets to protest war.  Last year in the run up to the war I was involved in a number of protests in various cities.  Whether they are small in your local town or drawn hundreds of thousands of people I believe it is important to show that there is people who oppose war.  Many people argue that it doesn't do anything, but I would beg to differ.  Someone once said that an avalanche begins with a single pebble.  Standing up and saying that this is wrong is a lot better than staying quiet.  We need to stand up and voice our concern and we need to do it more and we need to do it often.    Today I was struck by an image.  It is from the protest in Hungary.      And I am reminded by the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller    First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me.

      Well this week I think will be one of the most interesting in a long time.    Coming up is Division Manager Ratifications for the summer that's today.  Then there is the March Board meeting and followed by the Winter General Meeting on Sunday.  I have a feeling there will be lots of change and whether that is for good or bad only the week will tell.  Anyhow I am off to do groceries and then to the co-op.

      Well it definitely has not been a good week.  1. I missed the Ebytown shift 2. I missed a NASCO Exec Meeting tonight which all I can say grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 3. I scheduled the next NASCO Board meeting against a friend of mines Wedding (I am supper kicking myself against that one)  About the only thing that is good is one of long lost friends (i.e. I haven't contacted him in a long while) has emailed me.  Which makes me happy.  I guess one can say if you are looking from the bottom of the barrel one can only go up :)

      This has not been a good week for me.    I am still sick, I think if I can get three days of solid quiet time to focus my energy on healing maybe mediate a bit too, then everything would be good.  But I am stuck in a loop, I have a couple of good days and I get better but then I either work late or have another commitment (like today which I just remember I had to work an  urlLink Ebytown  shift but I forgot as the only energy I think could muster was to get home and crash and sleep) ...   On top off it I manage to break my key, I stuck it in to the lock and as I opened the door I moved to remove my key but it essentially went side way and the key had a nice 90 degree angle.  After trying to straighten it out I know have 2 such angles (looks like a flattened N) and a crack in it.    I will stop here because there is nothing worthwhile to write about ...

      Well looks like the adventure continues.  I came home early today because I have been feeling really sick these past few days.  More so just really really tired.  And I found the hardwood flooring in my room buckling great ... but all is taken care of just the hassle to deal with it.

      Well its been an extremely eventful weekend.  1.  I am still working on the Masters Application, I have managed to secure one academic reference and hopefully I can get another one sometime this week.  I am so excited. 2.  My long time friend  urlLink Heather  called me up and we went out to the  urlLink Grad House  and the Silver Spur (no kareoke for me). 3.  I went up to see my friend Shanley for her 25th birthday and along the way stopped to see Vidya (Getting married soon) and Mitun.  We went out to a club there called  urlLink C'est La Vie and had a blast (pics) . 4.  I am still under the weather although it may be getting a bit worse which means this week I am not pushing it and going to concentrate on getting well.

      Is it really spring?  I was wrong in assuming that with Spring comes warm weather.  Today I had to walk to the coop for a non- work reason (this weekend was a 4 day wcri free holiday and it was great). Anyhow I assumed it would be nice and warm maybe a tad chilly on the way back.  But when I stepped outside on my way back it was bone chilling cold.  All I had on was a turtleneck and a vest.  And unless water droplets can swirl in formation there was some ice crystals/snow.  The good thing about being cold is once you get to a level of being cold you don't seem to get any colder (however my roommate (the soon to be paramedic :) ) pointed out that that's a sign of frost bite).  Oh well in typing this paragraph my hands have somewhat returned to warmth and I can type at a good pace (starting off it felt like I was typing in water).    Anyhow tomorrow is another day :) Hopefully warmer than the last.

      Well I did my taxes ... hmmm and I guess I am finally out of the glow of being a student.  Instead of the nice "we will send you money", I got the "you owe us money".  Oh well, its money well spent at least I still think so.  Although as my sister says now that I am working I will transition to the right on the political spectrum ... I don't think so I like where I am.  Hmm other than that I had a pleasant Easter and tomorrow morning I head back to the 'loo.  But first I get to see Stacey and her new place and then tomorrow Nathan ... then round it off with some relaxing on Monday.  Then finish off the weekend with a NASCO Exec Meeting ... one which I am actually eager for as I missed the last one and I have a lot of business to transact.    I hope everyone had/is having a great Easter/Pass Over/etc..

      Well a couple of people have now commented that I don't seem to write here regularly.  I try to atleast twice a week but it seem my time is committed to other things.  So today  urlLink Digitally Imported  added a New Age Stream to their line up (I am so excited), so which means I will probably be switching from my salsa/trance/Chill Out streams to that for a while.  I guess the other exciting thing that happened was my friend  urlLink Anjanette  called me up and then invited me to this great thing called  urlLink Friendster  which essentially is a networking tool in fun way.  Really need to see how I keep running in to co-op people on there.  Co-op baby that is where it is at (I am in a great mood), it is probably because I have a strong feeling that no more snow will fly this spring ... need the sun need the rain need the flowers :)  Well it is Easter tomorrow oh how I am looking forward to that.  Going home to spend some time with family.  Should be fun.   Well I am off to gallivant on the net, well actually building another couple of websites should be good.   Cheerio as well I would also like to encourage you to check out my  urlLink photo galleries  last week (I think) I uploaded the San Francisco Gallery from February.  So check it out urlLink

      So I wanted to post yesterday but I was so tired after work.  Hence this morning.  My friend Cary came down from Toronto yesterday, we generally get together every month either in Toronto or Waterloo, its a great support system for both of us.  So we had dinner at the  urlLink Rude Native  in Waterloo, at their new location.  And wow they have really expanded in to a much larger location and it is much nicer, and less cramped.  It comes with my recommendations again.  The second thing is I am currently working on a new site to highlight the  urlLink new menu for Weavers' Arms .  It definitely needs something new and peppy.  The old one uses the same template as our housing website which I like for the co-op because it is a sturdy workhorse and it can accommodate lots of info.  But the bar needs something better and the info is fewer and more stagnant so I came up with this.  Although I still have to work out the bugs for a major part of it (that being that it is all screwed up in  urlLink Mozilla  and  urlLink FireFox  browsers ... hmmmm ...   Anyhow got to get to work.

      Well yesterday was my brithday and another year has passed.  It was nice to spend it with friends on friday and family on saturday.  Thank you Shanley for changin my mind about hosting a party it was a great event.  Much laughter, and much beer and wine.  Good times.  It was also nice to spend it with family, and even my nephews Austin and Wesley  urlLink made me a card .  Although I only asked for parts to a bicycle my parents conspired and got me a bike.  Today I rode it to work and found out how out of shape I am, something I will have to rectify over the coming months.  Well thanks to everyone :)

      Well its been just under a month since I have posted.  I guess I haven't had much to contribute or I haven't had much time.  So the topic for today is plants.  I love them ... I acquired some herbs at the St. Jacob's Market the other day and bought some more pots and repotted a bunch and now I am up to 18 different plants at home and 3 at work.  I am sure my roomate isn't currently too fond of me becuase we are reachign critical mass, that is we have plants in almost all areas of the house.  But they grow so well we have huge windows and in the morning they get the sun from the south east and late afternoon they get it again from the north west ... :)

      Yesterday I managed to accomplish two things of stellar proportions.    First, on my out of work I managed to snap my key in half in the lock.  Thanks to a friend they helped me lock up and remove the little bit, but it prevents me from coming to work which is probably a good thing.  Secondly, I was making my lentil soup and it was kind of dark in the kitchen so instead of the cumin i grabbed the cayenne pepper ... and let me just say about a table spoon of that is too much and quite unbearable.  So the ultra-spicy soup had to be dumped.  I am hoping that this weekend will be better, and with less mishaps.

      So I am finally in.  I got the official papers last night offering me the acceptance to the masters program :)  Hmm lets see the other big thing is wedding, weddings, and weddings.  A few weeks ago two of my employees got married, next week, my friend Kristel and Mike are getting married, in 5 weeks its my brother and his fiancé Farzaneh, and in four months my friend Heather and Chris are getting hitched in Cape Breton. So it will be quite the season.  No plans for me any time soon.  I guess the other big thing is I am currently working on logistics for the  urlLink NASCO  Board meeting.  We have twice a year, and it is a rotation meeting, that is different cities each time.  I have been to two of them in my three-year term and they have taken me to cities like Minneapolis and Berkley.  Well this time everyone is coming to Waterloo.  I have no worries about the weekend apart from balancing it with Mike/Kristel's wedding.  Aaack.  The last thing to mention, is last Friday I was involved in a very hilarious murder mystery, organized by Jana at the co-op.  Lots of fun.  And I won't talk about it but below is a picture of the group of us with the costumes (click on image for large pictrue).   urlLink

      Well it has been once again about a week since the last post so here goes.  If anyone has noticed there is an election in progress.  And at the beginning I was for voting  urlLink Green , there is a slim chance I still might but getting more remote. More than likely I will be voting  urlLink Red  for the liberals.  They may have screwed up a bit last year but then what government hasn't, including the former progressive conservatives starting way back in John A. Macdonald with the  urlLink Pacific Scandal .  What tipped me from green to red was essentially block voting.  I sure as hell don't want a government so bigoted like the Conservative Party running our country.  Besides a minority liberal government supported by any of the other left leaning parties would still accomplish the right goals and that doesn't include selling out to the states.    A great website to check out is the  urlLink www.stephenharpersaid.ca .  Then there is Mr. Layton who today said (and it made me chuckle) ... "If the Liberals don't deserve a fourth term, the Conservatives sure don't deserve a first"

      Well super exciting news.  Today I learned that I got accepted to the  urlLink Master of Management - Co-operatives and Credit Unions .  This is a program of the Sobey School of Business at St. Mary's University in Halifax.  And although I have to attend a one week orientation course the rest of the course is done via the web.  That is virtual meetings and such.  I am pretty excited about the prospect as it will allow me to continue working for the great co-op of WCRI and as well learn more of the skills that I can apply in my co-operative career.  Hmm this is it I am now going down this road.  Wow!!

      So I keep hearing complaints that I haven't updated my blog, well I must apologize I have been busy.  Too busy I am starting to realize, and I have had a couple of drafts of this blog.  My business began on Wednesday June 23rd (well its started before then but on the 23rd I started panicking).  On that following weekend I would be hosting 17 people from across North America for our twice yearly NASCO Board Meeting as well as attend a wedding.  Well in a nut shell I pulled it all together pretty nicely.  I managed to attend Kristel and Mike's wedding in Toronto, organize the logistics of hosting everyone, successfully vote, and even party it up in Toronto on Sunday night/Monday morning.    Firstly the NASCO crowd, I am very please by the new NASCO Board members I think we have a dynamic Board that should positively shape the organization to better reflect the movement.  It is also nice to see them because for a weekend, it is intense co-operation.  And I am still the NASCO secretary which is good as I like doing the work.  The second thing was Mike and Kristel's wedding.  It was nice I however managed to miss the reception because I was late getting out of waterloo because of the NASCO meeting, and then I could find the damn church, and on top of that I then managed to park beside a fire hydrant so by the time I got to the church people were streaming out .... its all good the reception was great nice and small.  And the loving couple is pictured below.       Hmm since then I have booked my flight to Halifax so I will be gone for ten days of orientation for the Masters course.  I have plenty of other work to do as I am trying to work on the 40th Anniversary celebrations of WCRI, the WCRI Planner, handbook, and numerous other training material as I will be gone for ten days.    But my pride and joy will be in two weeks when I get the pleasure of being best man at my brother's wedding. :)

      Well its Tuesday and it is about half way throughout the Masters in Management in Co-operatives and Credit Unions (from now on called MMCCU) Orientation session.   What I thought would be some classes and some recreation is turning out to be quite intense.  Now don't get me wrong we do have fun and wine and dine sometimes but it is also quite intense.  There is so much that we cover and so much we have learned.  Not to mention I am coming home with about 20 lbs of books/binders/video tapes and the like.    Today we are learning how to use the WebCT software that we will use to communicate with each other, and later this afternoon we are going on a tour to see some successful co-ops in the area. Tomorrow its team building and the whale tour.  On the weekend we got a chance to discuss with 3 successful CEOs of various large/small co-ops about their businesses it was so cool.  This is definitely something I love doing, and I am definitely down the right path.  As well my thinking on operation of co-ops is shifting, and I am seeing the inherent flaws that we have in our co-operative but I hope that I will be there to help out.  I will also be realigning my personal goals to be more in-line (they are there already just a few more tweaks).  The other thing is we have a great mix of people the class is about 15 people, of all ages (although I am the youngest).  But the good thing is that the diversity within us is what will strengthen the group.  We have people from large associations/co-operatives, some from small local co-ops.  As well we have people from both Canada and the States as well as from across many sectors, farmers/insurance/food/housing/fisheries.  So I am really energized for what we will accomplish.  The other neat thing is as part of the program there is a field trip, this will occur in October 2005 and we will be going to Spain to visit the  urlLink Mondragon  Co-operatives in the Basque region of Spain. For this I am excited ... weeee ...   Anyhow coffee break is almost over and the folk are trickling back.  I was hoping to post a picture but I may not get the chance.

      Well this weekend was good I spent it in good company of my family, both from my immediate family as well as those parts of it that have come from over seas.  My other thought for this evening that one shouldn't assume to know all, we never do stop learning and I think I have much to go.  The other thing is sometimes the best way to see is to close your eyes ...

      So yes I have been surprisingly busy as always so as the amount of "stuff" I do the less that I post here. Actually posting here is not a priority for me, and I am currently in the works to migrating to a photo-blog so you will see more pictures and I will have to type less. But that will not fully be migrated over until at least end of august, but probably with the start of a new term looming probably not till midway through September.  Anyhow last week was a huge momentous family occasion. My brother (Jan) and his partner Farzaneh got married. It was a lovely ceremony (pics to follow), and I was happy that I could be the best man. It was nice to see that even Farzaneh's parents were able to make it from Iran. It was also nice to see the Christian and Persian ceremonies that were done.  Then this long weekend I came home to London and on Saturday Farzaneh's family joined us as we had a wonderful lunch and then went to see the London Balloon Fiesta. This will be followed with another lunch on Monday.  In the midst of all of this I am also madly trying to finish evaluations that I have to do each term, I am already severely late. I want these out of the way by the time I head to Halifax on Thursday, as when I come back we will be in to the next term preparations. So what is up with Halifax? Well I will be spending 10 wonderful days in Halifax and the surrounding environs. For 6 of those days I will be attending a training session for the Masters in Management of Co-operatives and Credit Unions that I will start in the fall. So it will be interesting and I will write about it more upon my return. I do have 4 days of rest in there, and it will be much needed. It will be interesting to see the east coast as I have spent lots of time on the other side of the Atlantic in Ireland, so I will be intrigued to see if it is like looking from the other side of the mirror.
