						    urlLink    I do not harvest a deer every season. In fact, in the 12 years that I have deer hunted seriously, every season, and with great effort, I have taken a total of four deer. I consider myself a "trophy hunter". By that, I mean that each year I hunt for a buck that is "better" than the last one I took. "Better" can mean a lot of things--more points or a cool non-typical rack, or even a genetic anomaly to its coat (such as piebald, albino, etc.) I've never seen a cool non-typical or otherwise odd deer yet. That's OK. I'm plenty patient. I once went through a 6 year dry spell--letting lots of good legal bucks walk. Anyway, THIS particular deer was a mistake. I was hunting in an area that has very dense thickets. I could see this deer's body, and I could tell that he was quite a bit heavier than the previous 8-point I had taken. But because of the heavy cover and thickets, I could only get tiny glimpses of his antlers. I could tell he had enough points to be a legal deer, but I could not get a good-enough look to count the exact number of points. I also had only two seconds to make my decision before he was gone, so I picked a small hole in the thicket that was over his vitals and snuck the shot in with my 30-30. He was about 40 yards away. He went down in his tracks and never even kicked his legs. I learned later, when I was cleaning him, that I had made a direct hit through the heart. Instant kill. I was a little disappointed when I got to him and saw that he was an 8-point, but he was still a nice buck. I spent the $300 to have a sholder mount done and he makes a nice addition to my study at home, bookending my walls with his cousin (pictured below). But here's what makes this experience most painful-- because this happend, I spent too much time eyeballing a buck the next year--not realizing he was a REALLY nice, wide-racked 10 point until it was too late. He strolled away into the thickets without offering me another shot. Ah, well. Thats why I like hunting, I guess....its full of unpredicability, foibles and disappointments...but there is also always the off-chance something remarkable is going to happen.

						   Well, I did not have any cell service in the White River National Wildlife Refuge, but I do now. We are at our usual deer hunting property in Conway county, AR. We had a great trip this morning at the refuge, hiking miles into the timber. We saw several deer and turkeys. We also found bear tracks. Marked three good stand sites on the GPS and then headed back out. It is about 5 PM now and we have a lot of work to do before dark.   Crit

						   Once each summer my hunting buddy and I take a day off from work to make a trip to the deer camp to scout, move stands, cut weeds, poison the Poison Ivy (sweet justice), hack through the briar patches and clear limbs from our trails. It is hell. Hot, buggy, humid, back-breaking work. We love it. This year it is going to be even worse because we are going to spend the first part of the day investigating a new hunting area in the White River National Wildlife Refuge. We are leaving at 6 AM to drive the 2 1/2 hours to the refuge, then parking the truck, unloading my 2-man boat, and paddling across a bayou. Then I am planning to project a waypoint on my GPS 1 mile due South, which will take us into a very-hard-to-reach area of virgin forest in the refuge. It is there, in the remote reaches of the 160,000 acre refuge, that we are going to scout for locations to hunt this fall. Many a trophy buck has come from the Arkansas delta, and we are willing to work hard to put ourselves in position to get one (or two). We are going to mark the locations we plan to hunt on the GPS and then hike back out. After that, we will make the 3 1/2 hour drive from the refuge to our usual hunting grounds to do our chores...we hope to make it there by 4 PM. If we do not get there by then, we'll be finishing up our chores in the dark before heading home. Its going to be a long day...but worth every second of it. If I am able to get service in the wilderness, I'll blog in from the refuge.  I'm pretty sure I'll have service from our regular deer camp, so I'll send a test blog with any news from there as well.

						   Only a few more smallies after the 20 1/2 inch largemouth. I am guessing he weighed well over 5 pounds. Its 11 PM now and I am heading for the marina. Great night. Glad I came out. The lake is almost as smooth as glass. Not another soul out here as far as I can tell. I am always amazed at how many more stars you cam see when you get out on the water, away from the street lights. If it were not for mosquitoes I would think I was in heaven!    Crit

						   I am sitting in my boat right now, on the lake by my house, writing this on my blackberry.  It is an amazingly beautiful night, especially for an August night in Arkansas. I was not even planning to go fishing today, but I could not waste such a rare day in what is normally the worst month of the year for heat. It is probably 70 degrees with no humidity whatsoever. I have only caught two small bass so far, but who cares?  I may stay out here until midnight. The sun is setting now, and the daytrippers are heading their pontoon boats back to the marina. Soon I will have the lake mostly to myself. I will report again tonight if I catch anything good. Man, the frogs are LOUD!  Crit

						    urlLink    Heres proof that being lucky is better than being good. Im a newcomer to turkey hunting---started it just 4 years ago and Im completely self-taught. For the first 2 years, I had absolutely no luck at all. When I did manage to get a tom in sight, he would run the other way the second I made a call. Basically, I sucked so badly at calling that the toms would come in just close enough to get a good look at whatever it was that sounded so bad before they ran away-thats my theory. Well.on opening morning of year 3, I was running late--in a rush to get my gear on and head into the woods to be in my chosen spot well before daylight. I had done a lot of scouting and spent a lot of time picking out just the right spot. So Im half-way there when I realize that in my rush I had left my call in the truck. CRAP!!! I had to double-time it all the way back to the truck-about ½ mile-to get it. Now, not only am I winded and sweating, but there is no way I am going to be able to get to my spot before sun-up. I did not know what to do--I was ticked off at myself--ruined my hunt, etc. etc. Basically, I had already written the day off. But I was there, and I did not want to turn around and go home, so I headed back into the woods. The sky was already turning pink and I could see the shapes of trees and rocks in the darkness, so it was WAY past the time that I should have been walking around. So I just found a big tree and sat down in a random place. I sat there for about 15 minutes, cursing myself. Then, to make things worse, I heard the sound of a gobbler from right in the area I had planned to hunt in. ARRGH! And he did not just gobble once. He gobbled is friggin head off. It went on for 10 or 15 minutes and every time he gobbled I hated myself even more. Finally, I picked up my slate and striker, even though there had not been even the slightest turkey noise near me, and made a couple of soft tree-yelps. Amazingly, a hen yelped back from just a few yards away and starting coming. I froze because if a hen busts you, your hunt really IS ruined. When the hen came out of the brush I saw that there were two of them. They came right at me--not stopping until they got right at my feet! I had my leafy camo on, so I looked like a bush. As long as I didnt move, I was OK. They stood there looking around; trying to find the hen they had heard. It seemed like forever. My back started to ache, and every time I had to blink my eyes I was scared they would see it. Finally they moved on and I could relax. NOW things were interesting. Even if I did not see a tom, the hunt was successful because that was the closest I had ever gotten to a turkey. I waited about 10 minutes for the hens to get a good distance away and then I used my slate to call again. I touched the striker to the slate and scratched it across the surface--I had not even finished one yelp when I head a loud CLUCK! The sound came from the area the hens had come from. I froze again. CLUCK! Then I heard him coming toward me, running fast through the leaves. I dropped the slate and striker and picked up my shotgun. CLUCK! CLUCK! I barely had time to shoulder my gun before he stepped into view, about 20 yards away. He froze, looking for his hen. He was looking right at me. He started to walk parallel to me--still staring right at me. When his head went behind a tree, I eased my gun around to the left, across my body and aimed it between two trees in front of him and waited for him to walk into the gap. When he passed in front of my sights, I lit the fire. BOOM! He rolled over and started flapping. I was up and running toward him in a heartbeat. I could not believe my pure, stupid luck. He flapped four or five times and it was over. Hes no trophy-just a jake with a 4 inch beard and tiny little spurs, but hes my first and that makes him a trophy to me.  Crit   urlLink

						    urlLink    This was a fun trip. A few friends of mine and I try to make a trip to the gulf every on a fairly regular basis-we dont get to go as often as wed like, now that all our kids are involved in baseball, soccer, dance, football, karate, etc., etc.-but when we DO get to go, we have a great time. There is just nothing better than sitting in the front of a boat as it cruises slowing out of the marina and into the ocean in the early morning darkness. On this particular trip, we were after shark-and boy did we get them! We each caught several sharks the size of this one that day. We each kept one. The rest were caught and released at the boat. This is a Blacktip reef shark. We also caught a bull shark that day (smaller). The only disappointment was that we did not catch any really big sharks-we know there are 100 lb+ sharks out there, hammerheads, bulls, etc-but no luck. We had a couple on the line that the boat Capt. said were probably in the 100 lb. range, but they either bit through the leader or broke the line each time. &nbsp; urlLink

						    urlLink    While Im waiting for this years deer season, which I plan to report regularly on-even doing live reports from my deer stand with my blackberry-I decided to post some pics and descriptions of some of my favorite memories from previous hunting and fishing trips. This one ranks very high on my list of favorites, partly because it is my first really nice deer (dont laugh if youre from IL, IA, or Canada or some other place where the deer get huge!)  A few years ago, my hunting buddy got a beautiful 8-point, nicer than any deer I had ever taken. So I hunted my heart out for three years after that...often staying in my stand from dawn till dark...trying to match his deer. I tell you, sitting on a small, cramped deer stand for 12 hours or more is tough. You cant eat or drink much for breakfast and you can only take small sips of water all day or youll have to go to the bathroom in the woods, which is not good for deer hunting. Plus, Im not a kid anymore, so my back starts hurting, and I get sleepy-especially around 2 or 3 in the afternoon. Anyway, finally, after three seasons of disappointment-and after I had hunted hard for 4 full days of muzzleloader season and another 4 full days of modern gun, this terrific 8-point showed up at 9:45 AM...I almost couldnt believe my eyes because we were ending our season at 10:00 AM that day and going home. I had already written off another entire season and was sitting there feeling sorry for myself--and preparing for another year of smugness from my hunting buddy--when I heard a very slight rustle in the leaves behind my stand. I slowly got up, turned around, and looked through a fork in the trunk of the big white oak my ladder stand was attached to, but I could not see anything because of a big stand of cedars. After several minutes, a doe stepped out-man, was I disappointed. She hustled on up into the woods and I sat back down to feel sorry for myself some more. Then, a few minutes later, I thought I heard another rustle of leaves from the same area. I stood up again and looked but there was still nothing to see because of the cedars. Several minutes passed and there were no more sounds. Then my mind started to play tricks on me and I began to doubt that I had heard anything in the first place. Then, from the direction in front of my stand, I definitely heard a deer coming...fast. I spun back around (to face the front again) and got my shotgun up and ready (a Remington 870 with a rifled replacement barrel-shoots a 1 oz. sabot-sweet weapon for deer!). The deer was getting closer and coming fast but I could not see it yet. Then, from behind me again I definitely heard a step in the leaves. So now, after 8 hard days of hunting and seeing very few deer, I knew I had one in front and one behind me at the same exact time (isn't that the way it always is?). I had to make a decision-face front or rear? My heart was hammering and I think I forgot to breathe for a while. I decided to wait for the fast-approaching deer in front of me. I waited. I could hear the deer behind me start to walk away. Come on deer! Get here already! Finally, I got a good glimpse of the deer in front of me. It was a doe. I quickly spun around and looked through the fork of the tree to try to get a look at the deer behind me--already sure I had missed my opportunity. But I was amazed to see a nice, perfectly shaped rack heading away from me at a trot about 40 - 50 yards out. He was maybe three steps from being gone. I had maybe two seconds to get a shot, so I threw my shotgun into the fork of the tree, aimed for the shoulder-blade area and pulled the trigger, praying that I didn't screw it up. He went down in tracks about 60 yards out--like a piano got dropped on him. I was so excited I almost fell out the stand trying to get down the ladder. Of course, then the  real  work began...

						   Hello, I'm Crit. Welcome to my blog. My blog will mostly be dedicated to the subjects of hunting, fishing and the outdoors--why I enjoy it, why I think its important, and how my various trips into the woods and waters go. I decided to blog on these subjects for a couple of reasons: 1) I enjoy it; and 2) I am acutely aware that a fair number of folks--mostly people who know nothing about hunting or fishing--are against it and would like to see my right to enjoy it revoked. Maybe I can learn something from you, maybe you can learn something from me. I look forward to it either way.    PS. Bear with me as I learn how to post pics and use blogger. Hopefully, there is a pic of me with a nice brown trout I caught recently on the Little Red River near my home in Arkansas  urlLink
