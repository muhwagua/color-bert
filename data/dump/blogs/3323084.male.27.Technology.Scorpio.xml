      I've been learning about web design and have a  urlLink personal website  started, although it's not pretty, as I'm still learning.  Anyway, I keep hearing a friend of mine  urlLink Chris  talking about web standards and how important they are.  I heard him talk about a validator for his code so he could check his site for standards compliance.  So I got curious and decided to check it out.  I went to  urlLink http://validator.w3.org  it's a free Markup Validation Service from W3C.org.  All you have to do is put the URL of your site or get it a path to a file on your pc and it validates the code for compliance with web standards and displays the results.  First, I gave it the URL of this blog.  I was amazed to find that it found eleven errors in the code of this site.  I assumed that since the main underlying code for this blog was created by the pros at blogger.com it would comply with standards completely.  I was wrong, oh well.  Next I checked out the code for the website that I have been creating while learning about web design.  There are four main pages; they all had many errors at first.  But I began fixing problems until I had only a few problems that I had no idea how to fix.  I think they were CSS related but, I only just started reading a book on CSS.  So maybe sometime soon I'll be able to fix it all.  On one page though I was able to fix 100%, the page on Shady Lake.  The validator gave me some code to put on that page, a small emblem that I put at the bottom of the page showing W3C XHTML 1.1 Standards Compliance.  All in all I found it to be pretty neat to validate my code and an eye opener to proper coding.  If you’re into coding your own html I recommend you check it out.  Until next time...

      Reading through wired news, I found an interesting article about RSS aggragators,    urlLink A Scan of the Headline Scanners .  Being brand new at the whole blog world,  I've just been visiting my friends' websites or just browsing the internet searching for things of interest.  But I decided to try one of the RSS aggregators, I tried  urlLink Bloglines | Free, Web-Based News Aggregator . I chose Bloglines over the other aggregators because it's web based and free.  I use Windows and Linux at home so it's nice to get to use the same program on all machines.  After setting it up and subscribing to a couple of blogs I found it to be a most usefull tool.  It's a big time saver, all of the sites that I usaully visit are brought together in one place.  It's very simple and straight forward, that's good for me being as I just got into this whole blog thing a little over a week ago.  One of my friend's,  urlLink Chris , is the one who talked me into creating this blog in the first place, is a web developer and mantains his own site and blog.  He told me that he reads about 80 to 85 blogs a day using his RSS aggregator. To me that seems like alot but he insist that if I continue blogging I'll get hooked and start reading more blogs.  How nows, maybe he's right.  Until next time...

      As I was getting gas today before going to work, and I realized that I was going to pay the most per gallon that I ever have.  Remember that I live in Arkansas and not California, I paid  $1.959  per gallon.  I drive an hour to and from my job and that adds up to a lot of gas, 60-70 dollars a week.  That's a big chunk of my well deserved pay check!  And it only looks to be getting worse, I figure that at the rate gas is going, it's only going to be another week until I'm paying over  $2.00  a gallon.  I know that it's worse in some parts of the country, but the cost of living and the pay scale here is much lower too.  I was watching MSNBC and saw bit about the major US oil makers, they are all reporting high earnings this year, some as high as  90 percent  gains this year.   I'm outraged!    How on earth can they be earning so much if not for making a huge profit on gas. It just makes me angry.  And I've been thinking that with elections coming up in November that Washington would put some pressure on them to not price gouge us so badly.  I remember hearing some time back about the government looking into what was causing the gas prices to go up so steeply, but I don't know what happened with that.  I know that the price per barrel of oil has gone up some, but not at the same proportion as the price of gas, so what gives.  I think the gas manufactures have found an excuse that most of us would buy into to raise prices really high. Making them some really big profits, and that's the reason why the price is so high.  I have no doubt that gas would have gone up as the barrel of oil goes up, but not as high as it is right now.  As of right now, the price of a barrel of oil, (from a google search), is about  $37  a barrel.  I would like to see one of the Presidential hopefuls come up with a good solution to this problem for the upcoming presidential election, I think I'd have to give serious consideration in voting for the one that I thought had the best fix for the problem. After all, this problem effects the whole US economy and needs to be dealt with.  Anyway, the whole gas price thing just makes me mad.  Until next time...

      At 10:00 a.m. EDT the  urlLink Fedora Project  released the much anticipated final release of Fedora Core 2 linux.  I've been using Fedora Core 1 since December of 2003 and love it. But I plan to upgrade to Fedora Core 2 just as soon as I can get all four disc downloaded.  The new Fedora Core 2 takes advantage of the new linux 2.6 kernel for better performance and stability.  Some other nice improvements include: Gnome 2.6, KDE 3.2.2, SELinux, and more Java tools and support.  After trying the latest test release before this final release I'm very excited about installing it on my pc.  I tested the latest test release on an old machine that I more or less just play with.  I was shocked, in Gnome, the desktop seemed to run smoother and faster, it was more organized than before and they added a My Computer Icon to the desktop that brings all of your drives together in one place, very nice.  If your thinking about trying a linux distro then you might want to give Fedora a shot.    Until next time...

      My first ever e-mail address was with Lycos.  I was away at College and needed something free and Lycos was the first place I found.  I've had my Lycos account for over five years and have been reluctant to totally do away with it because some old freinds from college may still have it.  Anyway, a few months ago the Lycos home page changed, for the worst.  It looks unprofessional, the organization is bad, and now theres an Adult Ad right there on the home page, usually labeled  Adults 18+.   If that weren't enough, popup windows now bomb bard me as soon as the page comes up.  And forget about checking e-mail, I know that the free mail has ads but I think they may have sold my address to the porn industry.  Since the change, every time I click on something while trying to see any legit e-mail multiple popup windows come up, some are even blank.  My friend Chris told me to just get an account with hotmail or yahoo and e-mail everyone the new address I get and be done with it, but it's not that easy, I've lost some addresses, or others are no longer valid anymore.  You can tell that I keep up with my old friends can't you.  I don't know what happened to Lycos but it's not good.  I have recently moved all of my stuff away from Lycos to Hotmail were I'm much happier.  Until next time...

      To start things off I would like to thank anyone who takes the time to read any of my post.  I would also like to let you know that if you find any errors in my post that I am not good at writing, spelling, and I am not good at expressing my self in words.  I hope to improve though, through this blog. I've always believed practice make perfect.  With that said, I would like for my blog to be about subjects that really matter to me, and to be my soapbox for political  evens. Any comments are welcome, and I hope to post about once or twice a week.  That's all for now.

      As you can probably tell I'm a Linux nut.  Lately I've noticed more commercial software being ported to or made for Linux.  The other day I noticed that Skype.com has made a version of its windows telephony software for Linux, the site states that the high amount of demand for a Linux version was the reason.  Also on Slashdot I read that Real Player is going to make Realplayer 10 for Linux.  Novell and RedHat have already announced that it will be installed by default on their future distros.  And forget about Microsoft Excel, a new Excel clone called PlanMaker has been released, and is said to be better at running Excel documents than OppenOffice, of course for a small fee of $49.95.  I've just been seeing all sorts of new software for Linux here lately.  The writing's on the wall, Linux is here to stay.  And it's about time, with Linux numbers at or above that of Macs; commercial developers have to notice the Mighty Penguin. I just hope the trend continues, my biggest wish is that the gaming industry will wise up and start making more video games available that run on Linux natively. I also wish Apple would recognize Linux and start making its software available to Linux like QuickTime and iTunes.  It couldn't be hard, Mac OSX is UNIX based like Linux.  Anyway, enough of that for now, if you know of any newly available Linux apps let me know.  Until next time...

      My first e-mail account was with Lycos, when I signed up I was allowed to sign up for several newsletters published by various branches of Terra Lycos to be sent to my e-mail account.  I signed up for Wired News and  urlLink Webmonkey ; Wired magazine is now delivered to my mail box monthly by the way.  I'd been reading Webmonkey for several years getting ideas, tips and good tutorials until the first of this year when it was announced that they were shutting down.  No more newsletters in my inbox, no more updates to the site, but wait, now there's a notice on the site that reads:  "Today's Monkey Bite We're totally back! Webmonkey is alive and kicking, serving up new articles all hot-n-fresh like a stack of banana pancakes. With syrup."    There are no updates to the site or blog as far as I can tell, so is Webmonkey back from the dead?  I guess time will tell, if anyone’s knows anything about this I sure would appreciate you letting me know something.  Until next time...

      While surfing the web I came across an interesting article on Slashdot about Hotmail Blocking Gmail.   urlLink Slashdot | Hotmail Blocks Gmail Emails (and Invites)   The writer claims that Gmail and Gmail invites are disappearing, they don't bounce back or show up when sent to Hotmail accounts.  Also, Gmail is put into the bulk mail folder when sent to Yahoo accounts.  So you might want to check that bulk mail folder before you delete what's inside.  I don't know about all this, I sent my mother a Gmail invite to her Hotmail account and she got it I know.  Being use to 2Megs of space with Hotmail or having to pay $19.95 for 20Megs of space which sadly she had paid, she was with out saying very happy to get the Gmail invite.  As far as Hotmail purposely doing away with Gmail e-mails I don't know, but it sure wouldn't surprise me.  That's just the kind of underhanded thing I would expect from Microsoft.  Until next time...

      Reading through some blogs I came across an article on Slashdot: urlLink SUSE 9.1 Personal ISO Available For Free Download .  It seems that Suse has finally decided to offer ISO images of their Linux distro.  I would have tried Suse before but they never offered ISO images.  Instead,they offered some complicated ftp install, only suited for those with a fast internet connection.  Also it's nice to have the images on CD so you can share with friends.  I've wanted to try Suse for a while now.  From what I've heard, Suse and Mandrake are the top two Linux distros as far as being user friendly and having a complete and useful Desktop.  I use Mandrake at home now and it rocks, if Suse lives up to it rep it should rock as well.    Until next time...

      In my last post I said that I got a Gmail invite, well it looks like it's my turn to invite someone.  The other day I checked my Gmail and found that I had three invites to give away.  I have one left and I will give it away to the first person who asks for it, just think of it as a thank you for reading my blog.  Remember to include your e-mail address, because the invite will be e-mailed to you.  Until next time...

      A friend of mine  urlLink Chris , who has had a Gmail account for about a week or two gave me a Gmail invite today.  I quickly signed up and began using the account.  So far I like it, the layout and interface are clean and clear of useless crap, and so far I haven't seen any ads.  Isn't that how it’s supposed to make it free?  Maybe since it's still in beta there are no ads.  I'd like to see it with the ads to see how cluttered that might or might not make it.  Maybe I'll have some invites to give away soon.  Until next time...

      Have you ever wondered how some websites get those little icons on the URL field or get that icon next to their name when you add the site to you favorites in Internet Explorer?  Well I have.  While surfing through some blogs I found a post with a link on how to do this,  urlLink Chami.com FavIcon from Pics .  All I had to do was direct the site to an image that I wanted to become a favicon.ico and it made it for me.  Then follow the instructions on the page and you’re done, it's that easy.  Although I haven't yet decided on one for this blog, I don't think it will be long until I do.   I  have a design in my head, now someone just needs to show me how to create it.  Until next time...

      While surfing on the web I ran across something unexpected, an article about Linux on the iPod.  Curious, I began searching and didn't find much of interest, but I did find a forum about it. The forum rightly named  urlLink Linux on iPod  had some surprising information about the state of the project and some screenshots of the iPod with an experimental Linux kernel made for the iPod.  It's said that the Linux version has more functionality than the original Mac version of firmware.  It looks like the Linux community has found yet another device to put Linux on.  I've already been wanting to put Linux on an Xbox ever since I saw it done on  urlLink Adam Cecchetti web site.  Now I want an iPod to try out Linux on one of those.  Until next time...

      I just read this great article from NewsForge and thought I'd pass it on to you and see what you think of it.  urlLink NewsForge | Linux users are spoiled   I run both Linux and Windows at home and never thought about all the time I take to install software on Windows.  After a complete install of Mandrake 10, which took me about two hours, I had almost everything I needed.   (Two hours is configure time and install time total.)  And very seldom do I install anything on my Linux box, if I do it's usually the newest nVidia drivers or just an update to one of my favorite apps.  The last time I reloaded my laptop with WinXP it took almost two day to put back all the software that I use.  So check out the link, it's short and I think you'll enjoy it.  Until next time...

      C3SL, a research group from UFPR University in Brazil has made one Linux box running Debian run four terminals at once. They set up a computer lab for sixty people with just 15 computers. That's four monitors, keyboards, and mice per machine.  Using a kernel patch, 2 PS/2 ports, 6 USB ports and four video cards four people can log on and use the computer without knowing that anyone else is sharing the computer.  This is a great money saving idea for Linux, the os is free and now their cutting down on the hardware cost.  However, if one computer goes down, four users could be affected.  This looks to be a good option for organizations that are trying to keep cost low or for lab areas where users are not using much of the computers resources like surfing the web, checking e-mail or light weight apps.  More information can be found at the FourHead project website:  urlLink http://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/fourhead .  Until next time...
