       Kill me pills   So here I am at work bored out of my skull and all I have to do is sit here and get paid.  Most people would probably love that, but I on the other hand, hate it with all my life...................

      V-Day Sucks    Although I am part of the majority that has a boyfriend, I still hate Valentines Day, and I have ever since I was 16.  I used to think that it was because I was single, but then when I had boyfriends on that day I still hated it.  Then I thought that maybe it was because I wasn't "really" in love with them.........................but now I do LOVE him (my current one) and I still woke-up hating today................oh well............where's the tuna..................oh nevermind........carry on.............

       OH MY GOD......   well now that the day has officially started (I just had a coffee) I can rehash all the mishaps from last night and laugh.....What can I say, we are funny funny girls!!!!!!!!!!  Do to the high volume of birnocular (not sure how to spell it, but I know how to use them) use I find that I have become used to seeing things up close and personal and now I find that seeing things in regular vision is just not the same........So who are Mary and Teresa you ask, well they are just about as real as Nancy, Todd and Scott.....again what can I say Private Investigating is in our blood........and remember blood is thicker than water........

Like seriously I have been addicted to Sweetarts for the past 3 weeks, those and Tim Horton's coffee.........mmmm coffee...........I think I had to much today casue I am so jumpy.........jumpy...is that even word??  My day is almost done and thank god for that one!!!  Yesterday I went to buy a card and I saw a woman with a mullet, I thought those were only avaliable for women in the US (no offense to my US readers, still love ya!)  but seriously I have seen a lot more mullets over there than I have here............but that could only be becasue I have only really been to more US cities than any over here....hhhhmmmm maybe I should venture out to Winnipeg, I bet they have a whole highschool dedicated to those for the Hair Inpaired........I should look into..............till then I will only assume that mullets are hardcore American things.......USA!!! USA!!!!  one of the funest (is that even a word) countires to visit...........NEW YORK CITY ROCKS.........so does VEGAS!!!  Carry on....

          when will it end....      I am seriously getting tired of hearing about the war all day and all night....and it's not that I don't care, it's just that it gets depressing.....too depressing.....till this day I still get watery eyes as soon as someone mentions 9/11...it was too sad and all these casualties are just as sad.....I hate knowing that someone will have to grow up with no dad........I know how much that can affect someone since my mom lost her dad in the war when she was only 11 months.......so I hope it all ends a lot sooner then they expect......  on a lighter note.....I am getting old and I am having a hard time adjusting to this new phase of my life.....you know the one where you and all your friends stop hanging out as much as you have in the past and things start to change and you start having to save money for the "future"......ya I hate it............why me.........why any of us........why won't this phone stop ringing today? why? why? why?.......

        TGIF    so thank god it's friday!!!  i was getting tired of waking up early.  now I can sleep in and wake up to another gloomy day...I wish that the sun would shine all day......I think I would be a lot happier, not that I am not happy, but I think I would just be double happy...if that is even a phrase.......so this weekend I will probably spend another bunch of money on things I don't need.....but seriously who doesn't need $200 Seven jeans....come on they fit soooooo good......and who doesn't need anything ROXY......that stuff rules.....  maybe I will head out to the movies with some friends, maybe watch A View From the Top....."   I want my booties and I want my warm nuts"  ...... Mike Myers is just LOL funny......good times.....maybe we will go out and find some hotties to look at, maybe just maybe.......or maybe I will try to figure out how to set up Blog Feedback so you can leave some comments......maybe I will.....maybe I will......

        Long time no talk....    ok so I haven't been here in a long time, but seriously I think it deosn't make a difference cause I really don't think that anyone even reads this, well maybe they do but since I can't get my comments to work for me I can't get any......so waht has been new, nothing really...it's getting warmer, I still hate my job, and I am just basically waiting for summer to come, that's all really......I wish I had an exciting life to talk about....I wish my life was like some of the ones I see in the movies.......they have so much fun and they seem like things just fall into place for them.........why is everything so easy for them.........wait before you freak, I know that it's all in the script.........but I wish that someone would hand me a script for this life.......maybe this way I wouldn't make so many mistakes on my lines if I had some time to practice them before we shoot the scene.........

       Password: Go To Hell   So I woke up this morning with a weird feeling.  You know that feeling you have when you have a weird dream, you can't remember it, but you can't figure out what's real and what's not real.  Well that is how I felt this morning.  I couldn't remember what I did last night and I couldn't remember if I was mad, but I felt that way.  Later on my way to work I realized that I was mad, and it was totally out of my hands.  My friend who shall remain nameless has a bad habit of getting really moody at least one week out of the month and taking it out on me.  She calls and says nothing, just sits there breathing, why did you call me? if you have nothing to say, just sit there at your house and don't call me.  Then when I try to make small talk she will bite my head off for asking something that she thinks is totally ridiculous.  To that again I say  "call me when you realize that I have done nothing wrong....."   She is miserable and thinks that she is the only one with problems, you know those problems when you are a size 4 and think you are fat....ya those kind....so now I sit here and think  "shit my head hurts" , and really where did I go wrong, where was it that I was to go left and not right?  I wish I had a  rewind  button for my life.....don't you?

       People are strange   So it's Tuesday and I am back at work after a weekend from hell.......so let's see it all started off Friday night, when we decided to go to the movies, I wanted to watch "Bend it Like Beckham" (I think that is how you spell the last name) and instead they decided to watch "Phone Booth", which wasn't bad at all, but I am just not a fan of Colin Farrell, I think mainly because 95% of the female population is.    So saturday I hung out a friends place and got a sun burn on my face which was not in any way my intentions, and it is still red till today....I have no idea when it will turn a nice shade of brown to give my olive complection alittle more colour, as if I need it.   So later that night we headed to a club that we normally go to and have no problems there, however saturday night was a different story.  First off there were  A LOT  of weird peole there that night, mainly the 4 foot 11, 12 year old looking who tried all night to pick-up my friend ans his oh so obviously gay friend trying to hit on me.  So we went to another room and it just got worse....so we hung out for a bit then decided to leave and head out for some food to soak up all the alcohol we had consumed.  So I rolled in at around 3:45am and watched tv, and realized I was getting old. I know, I know, I am only 25, but I am getting tired of seeing weirdos in clubs and bars.  What ever happen to having house parties where I could look forward to hearing the Beasite Boys till 4 am and thinking that we did have to fight for our right to party and where can I find this "Brass Monkey".  All those days seem to be long behind me.  Sunday came and I had to do some stuff around town and I was starting to feel ill....Monday came and I was to be in court at 9 am all the way in cottage counrty, so needless to say I didn't get a lot of sleep sunday night, and last night was just as bad...I think I feel asleep at 11:30pm woke up at 12:30 am and only feel back asleep at 3:30am, then I had to wake up at 6:30 and that was a struggle.  And just to add to my sleepless night, I had watched "The Ring" early yesterday afternoon and it creeped me out to the point where I thought the little girl was going to crawl out of my tv and kill me.  Yup!  I am a chicken when it comes to scary movies......I think it all started when my babysitter made me watch the Exorcist at age 5...ya I think that's as far back we can trace this fear......  So here I am back at work wondering why I am back here and why I haven't moved on....I am so tired of talking that I think I am actually going to start doing things..........we'll see how that goes, I will keep you posted.....

        Friday I'm in love......    I am so happy that it is finally Friday, and the weekend is just about 6 hours away from starting.  I have to say that I friday is my favorite day of the week.  So did anyone watch last nights episode of Will and Grace??  I thought that it was hilarious even though Madonna was on it.  Don't get me wrong, I think she is a great singer, but I believe that this episode of Will and Grace once again proved that she should stick to singing, and singing only.....  And now the  Friday Five , once again I am going to participate, cause I like this one, here goes....   1. What was the last TV show you watched?   Will and Grace    2. What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?   I was having difficulty breathing, I have asthma and the weather here kills me.   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?   My boyfriend, and I told him that he was the #1 reason I get up each morning.   4. What was the last thing you threw away?   A napkin with oreo cookie crumbs in it.   5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?   The WB website.

       who else can I bother.....   it's sunny here today and I love it, I am in a better mood today and  I have found that the sun makes me smile.  A few quick questions;  Is it just me or are you all sick of seeing Jen and Ben in every magazine?  And is it just me or have you all realized that Kelly Osbourne only has a record deal becasue of her last name?  I wonder if she knows......if you see her over there in LA, tell her what I think about her! thanks............oooooooooohhhhhhhhhh I love this song...."No Letting Go" by Wayne Wonder......does anyone know it, it's a new song..........I love it I love it.....

       90210   Ok, my friend just emailed me to tell me that Beverly Hills 90210 is coming back with a reunion show....OH MY GOD.....I used to watch that show religiously....Brenda was my favorite......ok I know you all think that I am some wanna be valley girl, but I'm not....I do however wish that I lived in LA....I would be a surfer I think......and after reading everyones  "Friday Five"  I saw that all the people who lived in LA have seen so many stars.....I am now officailly jealous of all of you.....  So other than that I don't think anything else exciting has happend...hmmmm....well last night I went by my friends house to try on clothes cause she has her own clothing line so I got to order Fall/Winter 2003 merchandise before it hits the store, and I got to get a sneak peek at what to expect for Spring/Summer 2004.....nice stuff.....other than that life here in TO is pretty boring......

       First time for everything...   I have never done the Friday Five casue I have never liked them and then I forgot to check last Friday so today I am doing them and I know I am late....I'm only doing them cause I like this one.......   1. Who is your favorite celebrity?   Reese Witherspoon   2. Who is your least favorite?   Hmm I have many.....Winona Ryder and Milla Jocovich    3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?   Hmmm I think I saw Ross from friends once, but I doubt it was him.....oh ya I saw the singer from Our Lady Peace once buying muffins...   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?   God yes that has been my dream for years......I guess cause I think they have a better life and I would just love to be part of a tv show...they look like they have so much fun.....   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?   I think that I would have to choose Jennifer Lopez...only cause she has a lot of money and I would really like to see if she has to work as hard as she says she has to to earn it.

       HBO   So I haven't written anything in a while and yesterday I just put in lyrics to a song that best described my mood yesterday.......today I still feel that way....  I have watched almost all the episodes of season 1 and 2 of Six Feet Under, and yet it did not prepare me for what I had to go through this weekend...I sat at a funeral all Sunday and all Monday, and now the house that I go home to is missing one person and it feels really weird.  I realized this weekend that dying is a really strange thing, and not only till it hits home do you realize that people really do have to eventually leave and there is nothing that you can do about it to make yourself feel better, except just let time pass and go on with your life.  It's strange, I wondered all weekend long if she could see us there crying and then my sister told me that she had a dream of my grandmother and she told my sister that she was ok now and that she was no longer suffering.....  I don't want to die, it's too sad for all the people left behind to miss me......life is really strange......I have to start changing things in my life, and I have to start now......

I can't sleep tonight  Everybody saying everything's alright Still I can't close my eyes I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights Sunny days Where have you gone? I get the strangest feeling you belong Why does it always rain on me? Is it because I lied when I was seventeen? Why does it always rain on me? Even when the sun is shining I can't avoid the lightning   travis

       Lights go out and I can't be saved......   So it's Thursday morning and I feel ok, except for the fact that I have to be here at work.  I hate my job....I do payroll.........I want to leave but I feel like I can't, like I am stuck....I know too much about payroll that I am actually really good at it......but it is no longer challenging........I hate that.....does anyone else feel the same way as me?  I woke up this morning and my eye was twitching, I hate that, I could barley drive into work this morning, I kept winking with my left eye....I think that guy in the car next to me thought I was trying to come on to him.....maybe that's why he was always making sure that he was going the same speed as me.......  So the weekend is almost here and last night when me and my friends went out for drinks we decided to go to a club this weekend.  Now normally I am the last person to hesitate to go out to a club, but because of this SARS thing, I  fear going out in places where I will encounter a large number of people.......maybe I should wear a mask, but I think that would only freak people out......oh well......looks like I am staying home....ya right....that will never happen...........

       What a weekend from hell......   Well I guess I will start off by explaining why exactly my weekend was from hell.......let's see......it all started Thrusday night when my usual 25 minute drive home from worked turned out to be 1 hour and half due to an ice storm we were having, and might I add that only in Canada can you go from sunny 15 degrees to have a cold front bring in a ice storm.  So my night progressed into lounging infront of the tv watching Friends, Will & Grace and Good Morning Miami.  I then feel asleep on the couch woke up at 2 am to go to my room.Finally it was morning and I was woken up by the radio announcer telling us that all of TO was covered in a thick layer of about 10 cm of ice......so needless to say I went back to bed......I woke up later to trek out in the ice covered streets for a long overdue hair cut that I could not bare to cancel the appointment.  Later that day it rained more ice pellets causing me to stay home again that night and watch some movies on Direct TV......saturday began with some more ice freezing the city and then I had a lame ass wedding to attend, went home thinking I was going to go out but I closed my eyes for what I thought was 5 minutes, only to find myself waking up Sunday morning at 10am but it was really 11am cause we had to change the time by putting it an hour ahead, thus throwing me off the whole day.........finally it was ok to head out without the fear of dying only to come home and have to shovel all that ice off of my drive way because for the past few days I had been sliding into the driveway and almost hitting my garage......so then I figure I treat myself to some dining out only to come home with the worse case of gut wrought in a very long time (gut wrought is also known as severe pains in your stomach).......finally I woke up this morning, late and in severe pain from shovelling all day yesterday, and I am here at work only to find out that someone I was with last week now has the chicken pox.....can you kill me cause I have only had a mild case as a child and now I fear catching them again.......  one last thing I think i forgot to mention is that Friday night I had a fever and I thought that I had contaracted  SARS  which can kill you so I was scared and I called the hot line and the lady told me I was fine aslong as I wasn't in China or in an airport or near someone who was infected.  Now people have called me crazy for paniking, but to be honest, it is on the news just as much as the coverage of the War in Iraq, just that since we are in Canada and not in the US, we have no fancy graphics or clever slogans to announce what is happening.......regardless still scary to be around people.....  so that was my weekend, but now I hear that we are going to get another 10 - 15cm of snow tonight......grrrreeeeaaaat!!!  when will it end??!?!?!?!?  the good news here is that Friday it will be 15 degree again, hopefully melting all the snow and left over ice.....good times, good times......

Ok so here I am at work for another fun filled day of internet surfing.....why?  cause there really isn't anything else to do here on Thursdays.....there is actually nothing to do here on Fridays either, so I spend these 2 days just looking for funny things to send to my friend Brooklyn to make her laugh......so she is the one having guy trouble, you know the who never called, well I found out yesterday that she called him, even though I told her over and over not to call, she did, and he still never called her back......I think that NOW it is safe to say that he will not call back.......too bad......  Ok now for some fun stuff.....   Things I am really into:  ( I had a friend email me this list today)  1.  Direct TV for Felicity reruns 2.  Fabolous new song "Can't Let You Go" 3.

Pointy boots/shoes 10.  A new tattoo   Things I am totally over:   1.  The constant televised War footage 2.  Being scared of dying 3.  Scary movies 4.  the movie The Ring 5.  My dish card going down 6.  Jen and Ben's love life 7.  My phone always ringing 8.  50 Cent 9.  Crank Calls 10. Not knowing what to have for lunch  Oh ya, and I still love Dawson's Creek.....yes I know I am 25 and shouldn't be watching it, but I do, so get over it....and Will and Grace.....I love you Karen Walker.......my new goal is to be like her when I am 35, you know a pill popping, alcoholic with money and no heart.......YEAH NEW GOAL!!!!

       WHY THEY NEVER CALL....    "I think I threw up a little bit..."   ya so I don't get it when a guy tells you I will call you back later today, and then it is 3 weeks and you still haven't heard form him.....I don't get it.......luckily for me I have a boyfriend and I don't have this problem, but i find that it is becoming a problem for all the singletons I know...........I just don't get it.............why can't you just call and why if it's not working can you not call and just say it???  So if you are wondering why I said I threw up a little.....well it has been from all the dinking at clubs with all the my friends having this problem and trying to drink it away.....they can hold there liquor, I on the other hand can't..........especially when I am dancing all not long......kinda like Lionel Ritchie..........  so if you know why they never call, I would say comment but since I can't figure it out how to get it to work, so you can let me know at pulling_missions@hotmail.com

       I made a mistake....   I have a bad habit of doing things when I am not fully ready, example the Friday Five.  I always jump into it without thinking, so I would like to go back and change something, I know that I can edit my blog and change the actual first response I put, but I feel that it to describes me so I will leave it, but I will answer it again, for a second chance to tell you all what I am really about, and I believe that this next quote best describes me....   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?    " Fate exists but it can only take you so far, because once you're there it's up to you to make it happen ."   ---Jenna Elfman in her roll in  urlLink   Can't Hardly Wait     When I heard that line, for some reason, it seemed to really hit me and I realized that that is the best outlook on life.  thank you for your time and letting me tell you the "real" quote for my life!

        When things finally go good.....   Today is Friday, YAY!!  That means I can sleep in tomorrow.  However, it sucks casue I have no plans, yet, except to go shopping to find an outfit for a wedding I have in a couple of weeks.  It will of course be very boring and dull.  Unlike other bloggers, I hate weddings, they cost too much and you have so many in one year that you have to take out a mortgage in them.  Anyway now the Friday Five;   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?     I think I want to be remembered most for being a fun, loving and caring person, who always went out of her way to help others.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   Live for today and not for tomorrow   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   I haven't really achieved anything in the past year, I am still working on it.   4. What about the past ten years?   The past 10 yrs, I guess I would have to say doing all the things I did, good or bad, and learning from them and choosing the right path.    5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   I think I would tell them that no matter what anyone tells them, they can do and they can be whatever they want to be in life.  Also that they should live everyday to the fullest and never lose sight of who they are and who they want to become.

        "If you like Pina Colada's and getting caught in the rain...."    So in 3 days it will be June, summer is almost here, well in Canada, it's seems like it will never come, but us Summer loving Canucks are keeping our, well my, fingers crossed.  I love the summer and I can't wait to wear my flip flops without having to bring a pair of shoes in the car, for when the sunsets and we retreat back to fall gear.  I think that if it doesn't happen soon I will cry.  So this weekend's plans have been brought to a stand still.  I thought I was going to have the whole house to myself, and now I have been notified of different plans.  Oh well.....but don't you hate it when you think you can do something and you get all excited about it and then you findout that you can't, I hate that.......  I have been thinking lately about how much I  HATE  Sundays.  They are by far the most boring day of the week and I just hate waking up bored.  I have a bridal shower to go to this weekend (yes, the 4th one this year!) on Sunday and I already not looking forward to waking up, but I have to go cause I already repiled that I was attending.  But other than that I hate them.  I seriously wake-up bored and depressed on Sundays.  I have nothing to do or look forward to.  If I go up to my cottage for the weekend, I wake-up and go to the beach, but they still depress me because I know that I have to go home and do laundry and get ready for work the next day.  So no matter what I do here in TO, I can't shek the Sunday blues.  So I realized that I need to move to a place that I wouldn't mind waking-up on Sundays in, you know somewhere fun and exciting with lots of things to do......I don't know, maybe I am just crazy......

        Bangs, Bangs, and more Bangs    My friends ex-boyfriend had hair that hung down over his forehead, thus he had bangs, he was also bipolar, well we think he was....someone saw him, he looked like a rocker they said, rocker, who still even uses that word???  Ya she said she wants bangs of her own, I said no cause her forehead is too small, but like a good friend that I am, I said I would cut them for her if she really wanted them......  So I am thinking of writing a book, well actaully I have been thinking about it for almost 2 years now, but I just can't seem to figure out what to write about.  Should it be fictional?  Should it be self-help?  Should it be autobiographical?  Do I even know how to spell that?  All the questions plauge my mind and I have no idea where to start and where I should get a book to write in.  Should I use a book to write in or should I go straight to my laptop??  Again more confusion.  If anyone out there has any writing skills, please leave me a comment with your suggestions on where I should being.  On a lighter note, I have to go see a doctor about my stomach....hopefully I am not dying, that would suck.....we'll see...till then I leave you this....    If you could fly away and never come back, would you do it?  Why?

       "No you owe ME 500 dollars!!"   I think I want to change my career and become a window washer.  I am sitting here at work today and there is a window washer outside the building washing our windows, and I am in here envious of him.  He gets to dangle from a rope all day and get a nice tan on his back and neck and he also gets to peek into the windows and spy on the people on the other side of the window, kinda what he is doing now behind me.  I wonder if he is envious of us and of our jobs?  somone should tell him that sitting here at this desk isn't as glamorous as it looks.......I guess the same goes for his job.    "As I sat out front in the early Sunday morning sun, I could feel the light breeze off the water and smell the buring wood in the air.....ahhh it's 28 degrees, it's May 25th and I smell the month of October....."    My boyfriend told me that  urlLink   The Real World    is starting again in June, this time they party in Paris, the city I was named after....coincidence?  I think not.....maybe I should have auditioned for this one......too late now I guess........  So how was everyone's Memorial Day??

       Leting Go   So things seem to keep coming to an end.  Last Friday we said to good-bye to  urlLink  Dawson   and his friends, now last night I had no choice to say good-bye to  urlLink  Buffy    and her friends and for those who watched it, we also had to say good-bye to Sunnydale.  So my main reason for this post, I can't seem to let go of things and say good-bye.  In "real" life I hate change when it comes to people leaving and it seems as though I now can't say good-bye to fictional characters, even if they end for the season....I will miss you Jack and all the laughs I had thanks to you......And to the Series and Season Finales, thanks for making me realize I have an issue with seperation and saying good-bye....thanks.....

       Fake Plastic Trees   I don't uderstand why when someone puts on weight in Hollywood, it's like a big deal.  For example,  urlLink  Christina Aguilera   has gotten a wee bit chunkier, and I think she looks GREAT!!!  other people think she has done something horrible.......GO CHRIS GO!!!  you pack on the pounds I think you look fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!    And now the  urlLink  Friday Five     1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?   I prefer bottled.   2. What are your favourite flavor of chips?   I like Ketchup, and Smoky Bacon, and Lays BBQ.   3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?   Risotto   4. How do you have your eggs?   Scrambled with Ketchup.   5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?   My mom....and it was great cause she cooks amazing!

       Well then I will just have to wait!   So last night I was home wondering what was happening on Dawson's Creek and thinking to myself 'wait! Don't worry, Kathryn will post it tonight once she see's it'.  But then to my surprise I find a posting on her blog that she is keeping it a secret from me because it was too good to spoil.  At first I was mad, then I realized that she was doing a good thing but not ruining it for me.. So THANKS A MILLION KAT!!!  Anyway back to the things I can control......tonight  urlLink   Friends    is the season finale and so  urlLink   Will&Grace   ....I am going to miss these funny shows this summer......somehow I can't see it being a good one without seeing Jack and Karen.......oh well......goodbye Dawson, goodbye....

My favorites at the moment are  urlLink  30 Minute Meals  ,  urlLink  Cookworks  ,  urlLink  Oliver's Twist  , and of course, don't ask me why,   urlLink  From Martha's Kitchen  , is my new found obsession weird or wrong??

       Ok so I am tired of this....seriously   Everyday I get up at 6:45am, run downstairs to my bathroom to take a shower.  After I shower I go to the kitchen and put coffee grind and water in the coffee machine and turn it on.  Come back upstairs and put cream on my legs, arms ect. I then go the bathroom outstide of my room, brush my teeth, and blow dry my hair.  I head back to my room, look in my closet for something to wear, put it on, put on lipstick, grab a pair of socks, run downstair to the kitchen put coffee in my "Thermo Cafe" by Thermos, grab my shoes run out the door, jump in my  urlLink  car   or my  urlLink  SUV   and then drive along Hwy 7 till I get to work about 25 minutes and then go up to the third floor and head to my desk and log in and start working till about 4:30pm.  I am   SICK   of this.....I can't do it anymore, I hate it and I don't want to wake up in the morning anymore......so I apply for a job at the  urlLink  City   because my sister knows someone there adn it pays much better and I it would be the same driving distance.....bonus......... so let's keep our fingers crossed.....

       My Beef Wellington   So really can someone sit here and write in detaill exactly what the fuck "hazing" is.  Seriously, what the hell is wrong with some people???  And I appologize and I don't mean to offend anyone with what I am about to say, but only in America can something like this or crazy kids shooting other kids happen.  Really, do you not teach your children any morals???  Are you making sure that the media is the only form of authority in their lives?  Can you maybe stop throwing money at them to make the problems go away, and maybe come home from work earlier than 11:30 pm and spend sometime with your children so this way they don't feel the need to take out their frustrations on other peoples children, and they won't feel the need to get your attention by being on the nightly news.  And for those girls who thought hitting other girls with bats, making them eat dirt and throwing human shit at them, I think you should rot in jail, will you?  Probably not, cause your parents who thought it was a good idea to buy you alcohol, probably have a damn good lawyer who can fix your constant fuck-ups cause come on, it couldn't be worse then the fraud scam your father is pulling at work......

       Letter From The Dead    Dear Pete, I can't believe that it has been 5 years already since we last meet up in Vegas.  I had no idea that would have been the last time we would have seen eachother.  Your annoying attention to detail floors me, but yes I do remember that brown suit with the red flower on the pocket, but I do also remember the coffee stain on the your shirt, three buttons down.  We had a laugh in that casino and I can't believe that people thought that we actually had a clue as to what we were doing in there, I truely believe that it had something to do with the suit!  I miss those days and I wish we could be back there by the pool sipping on margaritas. In your last letter you said you were going to start getting in the habit of no drinking, no drugs, and no smoking, my question is when exaclty did you died and how come on one informed me of your funeral.  You son of a bitch, I can't believe that you are putting all those days behind you.  Who is she, and how come you let her do this too you?  Obviously you know that deep down inside I am happy for you, but on the surface I feel like I am in mourning for the loss of a bestfriend.  Call me when it all becomes offical and you decide to wear the the ball and chain.  Don't forget to get your brown suit dry cleaned, and sit tight, I'll be back soon.  Paris

       When It's Over   I have the monday morning blues, I hate when the weekend ends, and I have done nothing that I intended to do.  I was supposed to go watch X-Men 2 and didn't, I was supposed to go out and do things I can't get done during the week cause I work and I didn't.  Instead I went out for dinner friday night, saturday during the day I washed my car and truck, and only ran around town with my bestfriend trying to get her shit done, and then sunday I went shopping to buy an outfit that I couldn't afford for an occasion I do not want to attend.....so really this wasn't an "all about me" weekend, instead it was a "give in and just go" weekend.  I hate these ones, they are never any fun....no one does anything fun......well except saturday night...wink wink.......

       I don't get it....   This a weird Friday Five.  I am not sure if I know all the answers.  I guess I will have to make something up.   1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.   oh god, don't laugh, but that song "It's My Life" by Bon Jovi.....I said don't laugh   2. Name two songs that always make you cry.   "Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)" by Green Day and "Beautiful" by Christine Aguilera   3. Name three songs that turn you on.   I don't really get turned on by music.

       Dream of Californication     Psychic spies from China  Try to steal your mind’s elation  Little girls from Sweden  Dream of silver screen quotations  And if you want these kind of dreams  It’s Californication    So last night I had a really weird dream.  It started off that I was somewhere in LA, not to sure where seeing as I have never visited (yet), but it all seemed familiar.  I guess it was mainly places that I have seen in movies based in California, but what was really weird about the dream was that I was with all those who live in LA and comment on my blog, like Jenny the Prom Queen, Matt and Shane and some other that I have no idea who there are, but I couldn't see your faces, probably because I have no idea how any of you look.  Anyway, the REAL weird thing was that when I was in a location I have only seen through pictures of California, the dream stood still, like as if I had walked into the photo...there was no movement what so ever in the dream at this point....it was creepy....I appologize if I did not word that correctly and you have no idea what I am talking about, if so please comment and let me know and I will try better next tme :)  So the reason I quote the fabulous  Red Hot Chilli Peppers  this morning is becasue my love for California was started by the Chilli Peppers....they have painted vivid images of West Coast into my head that will forever run long as a movie I once stared in......  In other exciting (ya right) news, a friend of mine called me this morning to inform me that he has a sinus infection and he will not be able to drink this weekend, and this has caused some depression in his already overcast day.  Me being the sympathetic friend that I am understood his pain, and took him back a year ago to a time when I too was plauged with a sinus infection and was on heavy mediciation.  It just happend, as luck would have it, to be the same week we were to attend Dj Mark Farina's  (either from the US or UK, not too sure) birthday bash/ lisenced rave ( I had no idea it would have been a rave) at the Steam Whistle Brewery.  I being the retard that I am decided to drink while I had just finished my last pill that afternoon, and let me tell you that after only 3 Rye & Gingers, I was toatlly hammered out of my mind...I felt like I had drank 14 Rye & Gingers, it was the best drinking experience I have ever had so I guess this made him happy because he seemed to be jumping for joy......he now is looking forward to the weekend where drinking will be a lot cheaper for him.......my work here is done.....

       Things best left unsaid....   As the fog slowly started to lift, we could finally see the road a head.  Neither of us spoke as we watched ahead waiting in anticipation of what we would find.   I remembered times when it seemed that this day would never come, and now finally we were here.  We drove for about 10 miles before the fog completely lifted and I felt the butterfiles in my stomach flutter around a lot harder.  I could feel the tears behind my eyes starting to sting.  I knew this was it.  He pulled up to the large gray building where we had met before.  Outside was a gentleman in a black uniform collecting tickets.  I wanted to leave without having to look at him, because I knew this time would he the hardest and it may have been the last.  I picked up my bag and put my hand on the door handle as he started blankly at the night sky.  He was biting his lip as though he needed to say something, but the lump in his throat reminded him he should not.  I looked at him and smiled, he smiled back.  We heard the man in the black uniform announce the time, and it made a tear roll down my left cheek.  He leaned in and gave me a kiss on my cheek to wipe away the tear and whispered in my ear, "We will be together again, I promise."  I felt a rush of heat flow through my body as my heart raced.  "I never really knew why," I replied, "but I do now."  I opened the door and stepped on to the wet pavement, it looked as the though the fog was starting to get thick again.  I closed the door, looked at the time as I heard him drive off into the night.   Today a lot of people are off because tomorrow is a holiday, I am here and I am sad.  I saw my new nephew yesterday and it made me realize that I don't accept change very well.  Something I will have to work on, or just something I will have to live with.

       Time is on your side....   All week I have been wondering around aimlessly without a watch and with no concept of time.  Now normally I wear my watch from the minute I leave the house till the second I go to bed because otherwise I would be lost without it, I would always be late and I would always wonder what time of the day it is.  I used to make fun of my boyfriend and some of my friends who never wore watches, thinking that they were loser for never knowing what time it was and never knowing how many minutes till quitting time.  But aftet this week I realize that I am the loser, I am the one suffering this whole time wearing a watching timing every minute of my day and every thing I do.  I never realized how amazing the day could really be without a watch to constantly check the time, to make sure you were on time, to make sure you were doing things according to plan.  I have had a less stressful week not wearing a watch.  And now as I embark on the Canada Day long weekend, I will be watchless and I will have fun.  To all those reading this, have an amazing weekend, Jenny don't forget to pack the OFF! Skintastic for the bugs.........see you on Monday!

       Tell the dude in the black wet suit I say "hi".......    Well it's June 27th, it's almost July and school's out for summer.  Almost everyone I know is going away this summer.  One friend is working in  urlLink  Geneva   for the summer, one other friend of mine is making his way across  urlLink  Europe  , shopping, smoking, drinking and surfing his way around.  Another moved across country to see if the grass is really greener on the otherside, another just picked up and left with no direction and no plan, and another is living in  urlLink  London   for a month, to keep her best friend comapny while she takes a acting workshop.  I have opted to stay here, in the same place I have been for 25 years, again for the 25th summer, I can only live vicariously through there photos, random emails and random postings as they journey to the other side and live life to the fullest.  In one word, I am jealous.  I would have loved to just pick up and take off for the summer to watch the sunset over the Pacific Ocean while I burry my feet in the sand.  To stummble in the streets of  urlLink New York  drunk and loud, or shop in the crowded streets of  urlLink Rome  while the street vendors yell to get your attention, all the while being distracted from the smell of fresh bread baking in the bakery just across the street.  Maybe even ponder life with my best friend in a  urlLink  Las Vegas   casino at 4 am while the waitress brings us another rye and ginger to our slot machines, then head out to watch the sunrise by the hotel pool and then head to bed for a few hours.  Take a drive up  urlLink  Mulholland Drive   star gaze and watch the waves crash up against the coast.  Look over to my friend and say "this is the reason why I live and breath", drive off to a small cafe, have some dinner and dance the night away in random bars and clubs till 6 in the morning.  This is what I long for.....the good times they all speak about, I want to live them.  Now the perfect  urlLink  Friday Five   for my mood;   1. How are you planning to spend the summer [winter]?    I plan on staying in the city hanging out with friends and reading about everyone else's amazing summer.   2. What was your first summer job?    I don't think I have ever worked through the summer until I was done school and started working full-time.   3. If you could go anywhere this summer [winter], where would you go?    I think I would venture out to  urlLink LA , and all the other places mentioned above in my post.   4. What was your worst vacation ever?    I think my worst one was  urlLink  Vancouver, BC  , it was a very quiet and calm, I found it to be boring, but beautiful nonetheless.    5. What was your best vacation ever?    I would have to say  urlLink  New York City  , it was the first time I didn't want my vacation to end.  I finally found out why everyone says "I Love New York", and I don't blame them.

       That makes it 2 times   Ok so this morning I come into work and I have an email from my managers telling me that they need to speak to me next friday at 11 am in regards to their expectaions of me, what does that mean?  what do you want, what are they going to tell me?  If your gonna fire me, thanks your actually doing me a favour, but that won't happen, I don't have the luck to get fired right in the peak of the summer and collect severance pay from them till the end of August.  No.  If I did get fired it would be right smack dab in the middle of what would be our coldest winter ever.  Then I would be home during blizzards and snowstorms and all I would be able to do is shovel the driveway and sit by the window and wait for all the snow to melt off the grass and occasionally remove decorations from the Christmas tree, trying to hold on to the one good thing about winter.  Then my mother will walk into the room with a look of sympathy on her face, she will smile, I will look at her and smile while I try to hold the tears in, she will walk over to me, I will sit there waiting patiently for her hug me, then she will look at me and say "get off my ass, take down the fuckin Christmas tree decorations and look for a job already cause it's February and you have been off since November."  Then she will walk out of the room, my 3 yr old neice would walk in sit next to me and ask me if I would like a kiss to make me feel better.  Why the vivid description, cause I know it all to well, it has happend before, but it was a mass comapny layoff, I wasn't fired that time.  In other unrelated news, I have notice that  urlLink  Kathryn    and  urlLink  Blogger   have decided to change things up on me.  First I go over to  urlLink  Kat's   site and I see a monkey and I scroll down about half a page and her enteries begin there.  Then I read a post about how it only looks right if you are using  urlLink  Mozzilla  , so I click on the link and then I get more confused cause I don't seem to understand how it would look better there if I was using Mozzilla, and then I realized that I have no idea how to even use that.  And what about those people like me who don't know how to use that?  Did you even stop to think of us Kat, did you??  Well thanks Kat, thanks for nothing!  (Hee Hee Hee)    So I decide to come post something of my early morning findings and I get into my blogger account and this too looks different.  So then my pariona kicks in and and I start to think that maybe Kat is working for Blogger and she never said anything cause she is out to get all of us.  And that this all part of some evil plan involving Blogger, Kat, a pack of Kraft Singles I stole when I was 9 and I wasn't lactose intolerant, and the bird that keeps taping at my window in the morning.  Then I realize that I am just crazy and I sit here thinking of what to have for lunch.....

       I want to be an Angel.....    urlLink  Charlie's Angels 2 : Full Throttle   opens this Friday and I am excited.  Not only am I going to watch it this friday, but on saturday I am going to see Pearl Jam, and then to the beach Sunday (I know this time to wear sunblock with 30 SPF) and then monday back to work and then tuesday off for Canada's Day.  I get to just hang out that day and not have to work...YAY!!!......and maybe tan somemore.  I really have nothing exciting to say today except the new's about my nephew, I haven't seen him yet, hopefully tonight, so I have no idea how he looks, but I am sure he is the cutest baby in the world :) and I am not only saying that cause I am his aunt, I am saying it cause it's most likely true.  You can't change my mind or prove me wrong so don't even bother.  In other news, my face is peeling.  I peeled off the first burnt layer this morning in the shower, it actually peeled off by itself, but now I have blotchy skin, and I think I look hidious, although my friends and family say I look normal, they have to say that so I don't believe them....I just want this redness on my face to turn brown so I can braga bout my tan, instead of looking like a lobster.   Here kicks in my ADD ....I need to get out of this place, I think I have over stayed my welcome.  I need to get out there and get a different job in a diffterent company in a different feild.  I have no idea where to go, but all I know is that I have to and soon........

       Everybody hurts, but I think I hurt the most today......   Well I am back, after a unexpected 4 day weekend.  Although my intentions were to have Friday off, I however did not plan to be off yesterday.   I was BURNT to a crisp, I kid you not.  I went to the beach this past Sunday and came home with a "Lobster Face"  burnt ALL over my face and I could not feel anything but my skin sizziling, and my lips were swollen, needless to say I could not move yesterday....So here I am today, back, feeling a ting better, yet still burning, but really how many sick days can you take off for being stupid and not reapplying sunscreen after you went swimming.....I swear I was so scared I was going to have skin cancer....I was so read, I was so scared and I wish I would have done something about the burning sun, like cover up a bit better.........the only good thing out of this:  I will have a kick ass tan by weeks end.....my face is itchy...  Other than that my weekend was pretty lame....I went shopping and bought  urlLink  boardshorts    from ROXY, then I hung out all afternoon and then chilled saturday night so that I could wake-up early to go to the beach...nothing exciting, nothing new.  How was your weekend??  And now the belated  urlLink  Friday Five:     1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?   naturally wavy, and short   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?   I went from long, dark brown  hair with bangs ( I was 5) to really short choppy light brown hair with blonde highlights   3. How do your normally wear your hair?   messy/crazy   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   blonde, short in the back with long choppy layers over my face.  I really wish I was could have blonde hair.    5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?   I don't think it was ever a disater, well this one time my hair was cut one side longer than the other, I cried for about 5 minutes, then my friend came over and fixed it for me............good times good times....

       What's with today, today?   It is really boring here today, and I am lacking anything good to post about.  I didn't do anything exciting last night, so I can't post about that, I don't think you really wanna hear about my adventures pumping gas in my car, so I will not share them with you.  All I have really to say is that I saw the first 3 episodes of The Real World: Paris, it was pretty interesting actually cause already in the first episode there was tension, and by the third episode there was drama.  I love that kinda drama, you know the kinda that you get to see it first hand but your not involved? that kind rules....  Anyway you can see really how boring my night was since I am rambling about other peopels lives.  And the bordem was so strong that it carried into today at work.  Luckily I get to leave at 2:30pm today and not come back here till Monday........thank god, long weekend!!!  My plans for this weekend include lounging in the backyard tanning and then some swimming hopefully, then some more tanning, a few reruns of Felicity on Direct T.V. and maybe going out to a club, which I haven't done in a long time, probably cause no one wants to do anything anymore.....ya I think that is why.......so if I don't get to post again, well I am sure I will have time to, seeing as there is nothing for me to do here today, but I am sure I will have nothing to talk about.  So have a good weekend on the West Coast and you too on the East Coast.......

        I'm a one way motor way.....    Ok I just posted something and it disappeared, what the hell is that all about.  Anyway I will post again I guess.  I have a new look and I am excited, it's a new beginning for me, I feel reborn....or something....  Did you ever have someone ask you to go out with them and then have them tell you that the place will be really smokey and really crowded and that you probably won't even like it?  Did you ever wonder why they did that?  If you don't really want me there, don't ask, I won't feel bad.  I would rather you not tell me anything, intsead of putting me in this weird situation where I am confused on weither or not I will go. Like what does this mean, are you just asking so that if I don't come you can feel good about yourself cause atleast you asked me? I don't get it, do you?  On a lighter note, I am off on Friday so no posts till Monday, well I will post tomorrow, but not friday, I will be sun tanning in my backyard.  Fell free to drop me a line, if you don't know my number tell me and I will give it to ya!

       I don't think I can.....   I want to change my template for my blog, I really am tired of it and I found one that better suits me, but I am afraid that if I change it, then I won't be able to keep my comments section.  See the last time I tried to change it, I lost the comments part and I had to put it back to this one cause it was the only one that would work for me.  So basically I am scared to change it, yup that's right I am a chicken!  There are a lot of things that I am too afraid to do, some are fatal, some are just things that have always scared me and always will.    So last night I went to a bar with my friends to hang out and have a couple of drinks, I didn't have any cause for the next 8-12 moths I am to consume no alcohol what so ever so I just sat around with them talking and laughing because we haven't seen eachother in quite sometime, and that bugs me.  I like hanging out with friends and it's a shame we only get to do so once in awhile....so anyway last night while we were out we saw some people from highschool that we really didn't care for then and sure as hell don't care for now so we had to avoid making eye contact with them for about 3 hours, which was hard, cause I have a very bad habit to constantly look around when I am out, I get easily distracted, I think I have ADD in social enviroments.  This reminds me of a joke I read in  urlLink  Maxim Magazine  ;   Q:  How many kids with ADD does it take to screw in a light bulb?  A:  Wanna go bike riding?    Well I thought it was funny, I think that there jokes of the month section is the best.  Sorry to those who suffer from ADD........

       urlLink  Jenny Smith    Did you ever cross paths with someone in your life that was simply the most caring, giving, and kindest person you know?  Did you ever wish that you lived in the same city, let alone, the same counrty as this person so that you can be friends with them and they could continue teaching you new things and keep teaching you how to be a better person withput them even noticing that that is what they are doing?  I have, and it is Jenny and it sucks that she lives all the way in Califonia.  I would also like to add  urlLink  Kathryn   to this list because she too is one of the good souls and she lives all the way in Las Vegas......sigh............

       Why can't we just get along....   My weekend sucked.  Weather was amazing, sunny skies and the temprature was at a high of 28 degrees celcius and I actually managed to get a sunburn yesterday afternoon while I was waiting for the BBQ to cook at my sisters house.  You may be wondering why I say that it sucked since it was finally nice, well, it sucked cause I did nothing all weekend.  This illness of mine is making my life a living hell, and it is doing it right now as we speak (well as I type this post at work).  I did nothing other than hang out all weekend with the exception of a wedding on saturday night, I was in too much pain all weekend.  Now I am back at work, filling out a passport application and looking up prices for flights on the internet, ya your right I should be working, but I can't be bothered right now cause I am in way too much pain to be talking to ignorant people so I refuss to answer the phone........or spellcheck for that matter......  How was everyone else's weekend??  I hope you actually did things, unlike me...........

       Is it just me.....    .....or is everyone disturbed by the fact that Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher are dating?  I don't really see a problem with there age difference, but I do see a problem with there personalities.  She is Mrs. I have 3 Kids and I am Mature, while he is Mr.I am 25 but I act 12, so I guess that's my problem with their budding romance.  I am done with that, now on to P.Diddy, why is he always with them?  Is he banging her too?  Does she really like the cock that much?  Opps!   So this weekend I plan on relaxing, going to a wedding, the last one of the year, and having a BBQ at my sister's house for Father's Day, which I have yet to buy a gift for my dad.  So I guess that will be part of my weekend aswell.  It has been raining since early yesterday evening here, and I am tired of it frankly, just frickin tired of the ugly weather where it looks like it is 10 o'clock pm all day......sigh......  Have a fun weekend on the West Coast and hopefully I will be back Monday!!!

       For now, just this....    The  urlLink  Friday Five  :    1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?   I would say go to California, skydive and race car driving.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   Yes I think I am usually quite honest.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   I think the most important thing a friend told me was that they were gay, but I was glad they told me. So no I have never had that happen to me.    4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   This is a hard one cause I already have a warpped sence of reality and I had a hard time in the past dealing with the fact that what happens on t.v. is planned, that's why real life sucks compaired to the movies.  But if I have to choose, I think the show Felicity, only because she went to college away from home, across the country really, so I wish I had had that life experience.    5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   Well there are many actually...I wish that I could draw, sing, dance and mainly I wish I could cook good.  I know that I can already cook good, but I always wished that I could be like those chefs on T.V., they always know what things go good together.

       Order some golf shoes, otherwise we'll never get outta this place alive......   You know when you feel sick and you think you are going to die, so you lie on the floor praying to God that if you get better you will do anything for him, you'll start going to church, and you will start helping strangers and you will stop drinking, well when exactly do you have to start doing those thing?  Should it be before your next encounter with death, and your second round of  "please god, if you make me feel better I will......"   Does he hear us?  Does he care, when your problems really aren't that big, or does he focus only on the poeple who are really in trouble?  Maybe he knows that I am really not going to die so he just passes by me and moves on to the next request, and then comes back every hour or so to see if I finally feel better.  Do you think he ever gets tired of hearing our empty promises?  Maybe he sits there listening and when he hears specific voices he says to himself, "Oh Lord, not her/him again!"   Regardless of all this I have rambled about above, I may have to leave for awhile and I may not be able to post for awhile.  I am not sure when and I am not too sure for how long.  But please god if you hear me, I swear I will stop honking at people driving slow infront of me.

       Tostitos Rounds and Salsa   Today's post will not be profound, nor will it be me being depressed, well maybe a little.  Today's post is about my ridiculous lunch.  From the title of the log you can already guess what I am eating right now as I write this for you all to see.  But I forgot to mention that I also am having a 1L bottle of Montclair water and a buttered bagel, that was actually margarined, but I don't think that is a word.  Today I also made a harsh realization about my body and it's retarded reaction to anything it comed in close contact with (wow does that sound weird to you too).  I will explain, in this office as I have mentioned earlier this week in a post, is very humid and sticky when it rains outside.  So this morning as I sat here in my sticky damp clothes I had a hive or two at the bottom of my foot!  Does anyone know how annoying that is to have one at the bottom of your foot, how weird it is to scratch it without tickeling your foot?  I am annoyed very much today because this is not the first time this has happend, it happen a number of time last year.  So now I thank the Lord above that my house has air conditioning and that this does not happen at night while I sleep, but I fear the conditions at my cottage, where we rely on a fan to cool the place off.  I think I am going to have to start sleeping with the fan in my bed, it will be weird and lud but it's something I have to do.  So maybe this post was more about me complaining, so I appologize to all those who are tired of my random rantings, and I thank those who take the time to read, sympathize and leave a comment.  I bid you good day.......

       1978   I feel old.  I am 25.  Usually at this time of year in the past, I was never home at night, I can still rememer how much my parents would freak that I was always out and they never used to see me.  Now I am at home every night practically, and sometimes on the weekend too.  I don't get it, what changed?  I long for those days when sitting around with a bunch of friends smoking pot and laughing for hours at nothing was a plan for the night.  Even though I refuse to still smoke pot at this age, I still wish I could go back in time atleast 3 times in the summer every year.  I think I would go back to my first year out of highschool, which was 7 years ago.  I remember driving around in the warm summer nights, windows open, sunroof letting in the little sun left before it sets, the music cranked and the 4 of us screaming at the top of our lungs at all the boys on Yonge Street. Oh how I long for the good times.  Now if we have to get together, we have to plan it 2 weeks in advance, and were lucky if plans don't fall through because someone decided to make other plans because they seemed better.  "Sunny days where have you gone....."   The sad thing is is that I know things are going to change, but it won't go back to the way it used to be, it will only get worse......

       Muggy Smoggy Weather......   This morning was sooooooo muggy that it felt damp in here and I got 3 hives on my foot from the humidity.  It wasn't unitl 11:30 that they turned on the air conditioning in here and I felt somewhat better, but again now at 2:41 pm I feel like I have frizzy hair and damp skin.  I don't get it!  Why does the weather outside come in through the vents???  Now it's sunny, why doesn't some of the sun come in here????  HUH?? HUH?? WHY NOT?????  My weekend was pretty chilled, I still felt a little messed up from all the needles they gave me thursday night so I just hung out around the house casue I had the place all to myself this weekend....it was nice to not have anyone yelling or making noise in the house.  Now I am back at work taking payrolls from people who don't speak a word of english, so you can just imagine my fraustration level......did I ever mention that i hate my job??  No, well I do!

       9 Lives Anyone?   Last summer I was in a bad car accident where we were all surprised that I got out of the car without a scratch.  It was a miracle how non of the full size SUV's that were behind me hit the brakes and did not hit my spinning car that was headed for the ditch.  I had my first near death experince on July 14, 2002.  It made me realize that life really was precious and that we really have no control over the length of it.  I thought that would have been my first and last near death experience before God decided that I should be up there organizing parties for him, but it wasn't.  Last night, almost one year later I had my second near death experience, this time no cars involved.  I had an allergic reation to my allergy shot, ironic isn't it?  Within 5 minutes of the shot, as I made my way home, I had a 4 inch by 5 inch hive on my upper left arm.  I then called my boyfriend to pick me up at home to bring me back to the doctor.  As I got there, my throat was beginning to itch and swell with internal hives.  The dr saw me and immediatley gave me a shot of adrenaline followed by a shot of Benadryl.  As I sat there shaking like as if I was on speed or coming down from a heroin high, I realized it was happening again, I was losing control of my life.  I felt helpless and I felt as though I needed to other peoples help.....and I was scared as hell.  Later that night as I tried to fall asleep, I asked Him,  "How many more near death experiences do I have to go through before you really come to take me?"   No one answered, but I did however, see my grandmother, who past away a month and a half ago, in a dream.  I wonder what that meant?  Now the  urlLink  friday five  :   1. How many times have you truly been in love?   I have only been in love once.   2. What was/is so great about the person you love(d) the most?   Just the way we compliment eachother and how we love eachother.   3. What qualities should a significant other have?   The should be able to make you laugh when you wanna cry and they should love you no matter what, and should never try to change you.   4. Have you ever broken someone's heart?   Yes, once.   5. If there was one thing you could teach people about love, what would it be?   I would tell them to love with all your heart and soul, and of course I would tell them that  "It is better to have loved and lost, then not to have loved at all."

       Name Game   I have been paying people large sums of money for the past 5 years now, so you can imagine all the jealousy issues I face and also how many names I come across on a daily basis.  Did you ever notice how there are names that would sound weird to name a baby becasue they sound like "adult names"?  Do you know what I mean?  Well I came across a really weird one today so I have come up with a list:(and I appologize in advance for those of you who's name is on here and I offend)  Ruth,              Donna Bernice,          Deborah Bernie,            Art or Arthur Ross,             Adolf Bob,               George Jim,               Martin Reva,              Barbara, Miriam,  It's gloomy here today again, it has been foggy all day actually..........I hate it with all my being......really I do, I am tired of this......I am also tired of blogging about it, as I am sure you are tired of reading about it...............sorry.......

       Ugly   It's ugly here weather wise and I am getting sick of it to be honest with you.  The highest temprature we have reached is 23 degrees celcius.  That is not high for June weather.  It has been cloudy and rainy more than usual and it is making me mad, sad and depressed all in the same hour!!!  I think I need a vacation cause it doesn't look like it's gonna get any better down here in toronto........sure we have no sun, but we got enough fucking SARS........

        Nothing    I have nothing to say today really......I am bored with everything and everyone........I just want to go home.....maybe I can if I ask nicely.........i doubt it though......is it just me or does everyone hate those days......so really there is nothing for me to do here today except look for jobs on the internet and hope to God that I find one so I can flee this place.......  I hurt my back last night.  My parents are fixing the basement of our house and they decided to put tiles on the floor instead of hardwood flooring.  The company they decided to purchase it from decided to send then 65 boxes of 10 tiles per box.  The tiles weighed more than me and I had to help carry the boxes from he garage to the basement where they would be putting them in today.  Now my lower back aches and I have yet to find a postion to sit in in my chair so it won't hurt.  I guess I did have something to say after all.  If anything "real" happens I will post again later......

       Having No Control   My friend has the chicken pox.  I saw her Saturday for a couple of hours.  I am scared I am going to get them now.  I had a mild case as a child, we only know this because a blood test has told me that I have already had them.  Still I am scared.  I wonder, does anyone out there know anything about the chicken pox??  If so, please let me know.  I am thinking of taking off for a while.  I am going (keeping fingers crossed) to New York in September for a weekend and then to Chicago in October for a weekend.  My boyfriend  LOVES  football, mainly the  urlLink  Chicago Bears   so he wants me to go with him, I have no problem, I think some time away together will be amazing.  So I have to save money and hope that it still goes through and we have a gay old time, just like the Flinstones.  So my weekend was pretty blah.  Friday night I hung out with my boyfriend and all his drunk friends, that was pretty fun actually.  Saturday went to the mall and bought a pair of Seven Jeans, then rented a movie and fell asleep.  Sunday I hung out.  I hate sundays, have I mentioned that??  I still have yet to find this "fun" place to wake up in on Sundays.......

       Why do you need this information?   Has anyone else's blooger post page changed to this weird looking one I am using now?    Anyway, I am here at work today and I am barley working.  I am listening to the  urlLink  radio   and looking on the net for hotels in Manhattan New York for the weekend of October 3 to the 6th, let me rephrase that, I am looking for   CHEAP   hotels in Manhattan for that weekend.  I have found nothing.  I even tried the Holiday Inn Martinique on Braodway (I stayed there the last time I visited for a week in August in 2000) and it is quoting $189.50 UD for each night that we are there.  That means that I am looking at atleast $300.00 CD a night.  Come on now that is $150.00/night for 3 nights each person.  I cannot afford $450.00 on hotel alone and then be expected to go shopping and come back with atleast 2 pairs of Seven Jeans, 1 funky trendy handbag in a small boutique in SoHo, 2 pairs of pointy boots (black and brown), running shoes, and casual shoes when I have to spend that kinda money on a hotel.  I know, I know all of you who are reading this are thinking  "Hey why do you HAVE to buy all these things?" , but if you have never been to New York then you don't understand, and if you have been and still don't understand, well then I am afraid you have no sense of style and you are a big loser.  Ok, I am sorry, that is going to far, I take it back, your not losers, nor are you big ones either.  But I am just bitter, just upset and just annoyed with the ridiculous costs in the US ever since 9/11.  Now I am not putting anyone in the US down for this, I understand your hike in prices since then to try and rebuild the beautiful city we know as New York and The Big Apple, I blame those god damn bastards who thought it was a good idea to kill thousands of innocent people for nothing but revenge on a president or better yet on a government.    Again I am sorry for the venting but till this day it makes me cry looking at footage from that horrible day.  Reading stories of woman and men who have had to pick up where they left off and start a life without there husband or wife, or better yet there fiance.  It breaks my heart and I am MAD till this day that this had to happen.  But I must digress...  So today is my friday, I am off to IKEA tomorrow for a mini shopping spree.  Have a great weekend all!

       surf girls   Girls who surf kick ass!  I am here at work today despite the burning sensation in the back of my throat.  I left early yesterday to go to the doctors and they said that I have a virus, a cold one, and that all I can do it use nasal spray and drink plenty of fluids....I wonder if this includes margeritas?  But I sure I will feel better soon.  This weekend is a long weekend again for me for 2 reasons:  1.  I took Thursday and Friday off again as vacation days. 2.  Monday is a Civic Holiday and we are closed.  So yes I will be off for 5 days in a row.  Thursday morning at 10am I am going to the new IKEA by my house.  I love IKEA and all it's funky stuff they sell.  Then I am off to Sporting Life to see if any Roxy stuff has gone on sale yet.  Friday I am having lunch with my best friend downtown where she works.  Then I am going to tan all weekend long.  That's it for now.  Off to have lunch.

       But dude, I don't like girls....    So I am back at work today and I am sick.  I haven't spoken to any of my co-workers.  I have a VERY sore throat and it hurts to breath.  I finally fell asleep last night at 4:45am and woke-up at 7:40am.  I am on only merely 3 hours of sleep.  I think I can fall asleep any minute now.  So your probably wondering how my long weekend was, well it was fun.  I spent the days driving around town, running arronds. looking at my digital camera on the shelf of Best Buy and dreaming about the day I will finally own it.  The nights were spent hanging out with my friend and my cousin.  Thursday we went to a bar where I had a (no joke) 47 yr old man come ask me out for his 48yr old friend who stood in the background smiling at me and holding his fanny pack around his waist.  We never laughed so hard.    Saturday night was another weird evening.  We went to another bar downtown where we ran into old friends from highschool.  In a conversation between my bestfriend and an old friend of hers dating and timing came up and they joked about her meeting someone at 1:30am that night.  We walked back to the back of the bar where we were before we ran into these friends and she began to talk to a guy who she also knew.  His friend asked me if she had a boyfriend cause his friend had been interested in her for a while now.  This was at 1:29am.  We spoke to them for about 30 minutes before me and his friends decided that it was time to let them know that they were both interested in one another.  At 2:15 am they had exchanged #'s.  We stummbled in at about 3:45am.  I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.  She fell asleep at about 6am, after rehashing the nights events and thinking about all the things I used to tell her about fate.  I think I may have been right.  The rest of my weekend consisted of me cleaning up, cooking dinner for friends and visiting my grandmother at the cemetery.  This always makes me cry.  I guess it's the guilt I feel ever since she passed away in April.  I don't know when I will get over this.  Later on yesterday night we searched my messy (and in the middle of being renovated) basement for my sister's highschool yearbook, to look up the guy from the night before.  We couldn't find them at first.  Instead we stummbled across a box of all my old toys, which included 2 pairs of pink ceramic ballet slippers.  None of the 3 of us ever took ballet.  I swear the 2 of us laughed so hard I peed my pants a little.  That's when I realized I have 3 very different girl friends, and that she was the only one I could do things like this with.  Good time...I miss them.  Someone's feet reek in here today.  I think I am going to vomit from the smell.  God help us.

       X-Games 9   I am in an all day meeting today on the 6th floor.  At times it crossed my mind to jump out the window in hopes that I would land on my feet to get out of this meaningless and pointless meeting.  But opted not to.  The windows don't open and they are dar to thick to try and break through.  I would probably bounce off the window and land on my ass and have to explain to everyone what the hell I was trying to do and why.  Which in turn would make the person giving the meeting feel worthless and boring.    Yesterday night I couldn't breath very well.  My asthma was acting up and I sounded like Malcom friend in the wheelchair who has asthma and takes a breath after every word he said.  At about 11 my boyfriend called me as he got home to ask me if I missed him.  I didn't cause he was over for dinner for my mom's birthday, but I said yes, because I know that is what I would want to hear.  He giggled and told me he realized how much his night sucked without me there and how he missed spending the nights with me.  I felt all warm and fuzzy inside while he told me this, I never heard him say things like this to and now I finally knew how he felt when I told him all these things.  It's nice to be loved.  Today is my Friday.  I am off tomorrow and the real Friday.  I took 2 vacation days to just chill and relax and rest my wrists.  I have an interview again tomorrow morning at 10.  I am excited, it is with a car dealership in there office.  If I get the job, I am sure that in a couple of years I will get a deal on a BMW, Rangrover, Volkswagon or Acura if I wanted to purchase a new one.  Wish me luck (again) this one seems really good.  Have a good weekend west coast friends.  See you monday.

       La La La   Today is my mom's birthday.....HAPPY BIRTHDAY LADY JANE!!!!  I bought her a Fendi purse for her birthday it looks like  urlLink  this  , I really really hope she likes it.  I know she will cause it is Fendi, but I really hope she even likes the way it looks.  If not the lady said that she only does exchanges no refunds, but they have my Louis Vuitton one that I want there so I know I can just get that instead.  In other news, there really is no other news.  I lead quite a boring life up here, but hopefully things will take a turn a get better, but with my luck it will take a turn for the worse and my summer will officially suck balls.    I can't think of anything else really to say, well I am thinking of things to put in  urlLink  Jenny's    birthday package, other than that not doing much....

       There and back again   So I am back at work today.  It's busy as per usual on a  Monday.  The phone hasn't stopped ringing all day.  I want to go home.  As for my weekend.....hmmm friday I had that interview that went really well, but with my luck I won't get the job.....then I had a pedicure and manicure and then I had lucnch with a friend.  Saturday and Sunday were spent just chilling out with my boyfriend and looking for knock off Fendi and Louis Vittons bags for me and my mom.....good times....we never found any so the search conitnues tonight.....  So now the  urlLink  Friday Five  ( a belated one ):   1. When was the last time you cheated?   Ok I don't get this one, cheated how on a test or on someone, in both cases never!  I could never hurt someone like that and I was way too paranoid to ever cheat on a test or something.   2. When was the last time you stole?   Probably back in highschool.    3. When was the last time you lied?   Probably this morning when I told someone that I liked there hair but I didn't really.    4. When was the last time you broke or vandalized another's property?   I think it was back in highschool...I threw an egg at my friends ex-boyfriends car.   5. When was the last time you hurt a loved one?   Again back in highschool, I broke up with someone who was head over heels for me.....some sort of puppy love....I think he is over it by now, he's dating my old bestfriend.  This one was weird...carry on....

       Just because...    Today is July 17th....summer is half way over, and I have done nothing that can make me say, come september, "what an F***ing amazing summer!!!"  nothing of that sort.  All I have been doing is staying in and chillin out on the couch at night contemplating leaving this awful job.  I remember when past summers consisted of screaming at the top of our lungs off of balcony's or out of car windows as we cruised downtown.  Dancing with lesbian in a gay bar cause two of your close friends want you to experience their gay lifestyle with them, followed by a semi-drunk drive home with pit stops to get food, to puke or just to catch your breath from laughing so hard at something stupid your bestfriend just did or just said.  I miss these days.  I want this summer to be like those past ones where we didn't care what time it was, we didn't want the nights to end, and we wished the summer could last forever.  I called my "bestfriend" this morning and told her about all of this and she said, and I quote,   "those weren't all summer adventures really, they are just things we did in the past when we were dumber and just plain silly.  but you grow up and things change and you have different adventures and different priorites."    But I disagree, I don't have different priorites, I don't think I have ever really had any to begin with.....and I don't want different adventures, I want fun ones, not boring ones that consist of me looking for furniture, that's not fun nor an adventure.  I miss "stalking" ex boyfriends, trying to see if life went on without me, I miss looking for that guy my friend has a crush on, so that we can just "accidently" end up in the same bar/club as him.  I seriously didn't think that blowing out 25 candles this year meant that I was going to grow up.  I thought picking out a wedding dress would mean I was growing up a little bit.  Me and one of my close friends always said that we could see the two of us partying till we were 30, having a blast, drinking every night, never getting to bed before 3:30am, regardless of the fact that we had to be up by 7 the next morning.  Now I barley see him or speak to him....he is too busy.....I don't get it, is it just me?  Am I the only one who doesn't want to grow up yet?  Am I the only one who wants to use these 3 months of summer as a way of making great memories and great stories to tell the grandchildren?  Am I?  Am I really alone on this??

       he was right.....    The Scientist  Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are  I had to find you Tell you I need you Tell you I set you apart  Tell me your secrets And ask me your questions Oh let's go back to the start  Running in circles Coming up tails Heads on a silence apart  Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard  Oh take me back to the start  I was just guessing At numbers and figures Pulling your puzzles apart  Questions of science Science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart  Tell me you love me Come back and haunt me Oh and I rush to the start  Running in circles Chasing our tails Coming back as we are  Nobody said it was easy Oh it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard  I'm going back to the start

       My way in....   So my movie friend that my boyfriend was talking about came through for me.  There is no movie role or anything, I actually don't think I would want that, there is all that pressure to be super thin, and I just don't have that in me.  It's something better, well I think, I went to her with an idea for a script that she can do and instead she has forced me to write it myself and she will have it made for free and then maybe put into a few film festivals and then maybe some of the right people will see it.  Who knows, I think that the idea of having your thoughts made into a short film is cool, regardless of how far it gets me.  P.S.  I got a call back for an interview for one of the jobs I posted about earlier.  It's the 3 day a week one.  It's Friday at 9am.  Wish me luck!!

       2 things   Last night I was at home with my boyfriend sitting on the couch reading Us Magazine while he watched ESPN for the most recent updates in football news.  This was how the converstation went:   Me: Hey if I was a rich and famous actress or singer and I was on location or tour all the time, would you quit your job and come everywhere with me.  J:  Umm hell ya! Why is your movie friend gonna put you in a movie and make you a big star and then we can buy a house in Hawaii?  Me: umm ya I don't think so.....  J: why?  why not?  what the hell kinda friends do you keep?  Me: It's not her fault it's mine.  J: why what did you do?  Me: I can't act.

       Beer, chips and football    I don't get it, why do american's think it is SOOOO bad to come to toronto????  All I heard this morning on my drive in was how they think you can catch SARS just by coming in our airport, well it's not true.  I believe that this is just their way at getting back at us cause we didn't join Bush in his war.  So you know what I say, go ahead and ban americans from coming into toronto, let them go to China and Japan and Thailand where the virus originated and is still lurking under the pillows of the childen in the village and come back an infect your "Great" country.  I mean no offence to those americans like Jenny, Kathryn, Ryan, Matt and all the others who venture here to read this blog.  I am sorry if I offend any of the above.  I am just sick of people thinking that you shouldn't go to toronto cause you will die from SARS.  If that be the case I shouldn't venture out to Detriot or Chicago or LA or even the "bad" parts of New York cause I might get shot!

       Why does your Honda Civic sound like a race car??   Today when I was driving to work I realized that one year ago today I almost died in car accident.  It was pretty bad, no one could figure out how me and my friend walked out of the car without a scratch, and till this day it remains a mystery.   That day I vowed (once I was over the shock of the whole situation) that I would live life to the fullest and that I would say whatever I want to say, do whatever I want to do, and so on.  I haven't.  It's been one year and I still am at a job I hate (I know I have said this way to much now) and I still don't do whatever I want, cause if that was the case I would have got up and walked out of here earlier this morning when I was VERY pissed off.  I seriously think that I can no longer post positive things while I am here.  I may have to stop posting till I find a new job.

       Friend of a friend of a friend....   So I was out last night in the pouring rain and my hair got all messy and frizzy and then my boyfriend decided to start making fun of me...ya good times indeed.....it was nice actually to spend time with him without having planned it.  It was nice when my doorbell rang and he was the one ringing it without letting me know he was coming over, I LOVE that, I usually surpirse him like that but this time he beat me to it.....So when I was out in the rain, I was running back to the truck and my lovely PUMA flipflop went flying under the truck and I had to run on the wet pavement barefoot.  That's when I realized that I am easily disgusted by the weirdest things.  For instance when you are washing a jar to reuse it, but it has a label and the label gets wet from the water, I gag everytime my fingers accidentaly touch the paper, I think it is gross.  Also when I am putting mousse or gel into my wet hair and lose hair gets stuck to my sticky fingers, again I gag to no end.  It is really weird actually that this happens, I have no idea why I am so delicate for that stuff.....oh well.......on to the friday five and plans for this weekend......   1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?   Yes I do, her name was Carolyn.    2. Are you still in touch with this person?   No I moved away when I was 8, so it was hard to keep in touch without a car, or a license for that matter.   3. Do you have a current close friend?   Yes, I have about 4.   4. How did you become friends with this person?   We all met in highschool.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?   Ya, I think it would be nice to see people from the past, to see how they have changed and to see if they lived out their life long dream of becoming and fireman, or a teacher, or a nurse, and tell then how I didn't become a movie star...although they probably already know that...  So this weekend consists of me buying a digital camera.  Not sure which one and not sure where but I WANT one, no wait I NEED one so I am going to convince my boyfriend to pay for half.......I will have to bribe him with candy......so I will need to got to the candy store too.

       Sunrise, Sunset   I applied for 2 jobs today.  Both payroll and both seem better than what I am doing here.  One is for 3 days a week and it is around the corner of my house, which would be sweet if I didn't have to waste so much gas going to work.  I'm just not sure what I would do with the other 2 days that I am free, well if I even get this job.  I guess I can focus on the other things I want to do with my life, like writing the best american novel, and my photography.  The other one seems like it would be just as good, 5 days a week and about a 10 minute drive from my house.  Good times, I hope I get one of them.  In other news, it's cloudy here today and it is putting everyone in either a bad mood, a lazy mood, or a rotten one.  I happen to be in all 3 as per usual...and it's busy here for a Thursday and I don't like that.  It means that I can't do all the other things I want to do, like go online and look for jobs.

       Back to where I went wrong...   Last night I was driving around my city looking for a store to buy the newspaper so that I could look at there classified section for a new job, or even an idea for a career that I can take some courses on.  It was such a beautiful night, as the sun was setting the sky was pink, red and purple and it just made me love summer even more.  It made me think that I have to take advantage of these sunsets casue come winter there is no sun to set, and on the odd day that the sun does come out, when it is setting I am still at work, and when I get home at 5pm it felt like midnight and I always had the thought in the back of my head to be in bed.  But last night as I was driving I heard a song that made me think of life, my life, and also made me think about change and how I don't really accept it very well.  I hate drives like that, ones that make me think when I don't really feel like thinking at that point in time.  And I don't really mean hate, I guess I love those drives really cause they force me to deal with things.  Day by day I try to think of things to get me through these changes and help me except things once they are no longer.  I was watching t.v and I heard someone say something about change and how things can never be the same, and it hit me and it made a lot of sense, they said; "Change is good and it can also be hard, but it's inevitable, so it's important that when you move forward, you try not to look back too much."  And they were right.  I know what my problem is, I don't want to things to change, I don't want to grow up, I don't want to stop having the fun you can only have with your friends between the ages of 18-23.  I want it all to last forever.  But alas, I realize that it can't and now it is time for me to move on.

       You gotta go there to come back....   I thought it was pretty cool when I heard it this morning on the radio, it is the title for the  urlLink  Sterophonics   new album that comes out in Canada sometime soon, but I am thinking of making it the title of the book that I am writing.  It's basically about something like that.....having to actaully go through something to come out a better person....like having to go to hell and back to realize things are just fine the way they are.  I am not 100% sure about the books actaul storyline, but I am hoping that it's going to be a good one.  Something that people can read and be like "hey, i know exactly what you mean", or maybe they can be like "wow, what a crazy fun adventure that was."  somthing that people can relate too, the kind of book I would like to read.  But I realized that when you are trying to write the best american novel while living in Toronto, you either have to do a lot of research or you have to pick up your shit and actually venture out there.  Unfortunatley due to the lack of money I have opted to research via internet.  Hopefully this book will make it to your hands, hopefully this book will actually have an ending, unlike the other 5 stories I have tried to write.  My only problem is that I hate critisism, and I hate having to hear bad things about my work from people I know, adn I hate when people I know read my stuff, that's why I am considering putting another name on the book.....kinda like a stage name....

       Dude   I have noticed something really strange over the past couple of days, I have been using the word  "Dude"  more often than needed or even necessary, then I realized that it is never really necessary, nothing really is.  But it seems that I have been confusing people by using this word cause I have never used it and now that I am I guess they are seeing me in a different light, a brighter one nonetheless.    Well enough about that, I was of yesterday for Canada's Birthday, also my sisters, and all I did was relax on the porch and ponder life.  Then I started to get depressed so I got up and went for a drive.   I drove by all the place that I used to hang out with friends when we were younger and when no one had a car to go downtown with.  It was weird, yet enlightening to see that our old spots were now being occupied by kids that would be about the same age we were when we made those places our home away from home.  It reminded me that life goes on, we do get older, but our memories are what we have to hold on to this part of our lives.  A way to relive the past.  But as I drove past these places and back to my front porch I was sad to see that these times did pass and that now all we could do was look back on old pictures and remember the good time.  But that was when it hit me.  I realized some underlining issue I had and have always had, I can't deal with change, it frightens me and it makes  me regress back to my childhood ways.  It is a big concerne for me, I have realized that everytime my life made a change toward the "next big step", I would freak out.  I have no way to control this and I fear that as my life progresses and all the necessary changes be made, I will once again regress back into the way I was and not move forward at all.  I will forever be stuck at 19, and for some reading this you think it is a good thing, but my friends as I live through it, I can surely tell you that it is not......

       Heaven is a half pipe    Today is my last day of work before the nice long weekend, and to top it off I am leaving work at 1:30pm cause I have an appointment.....oh ya.....  This weekend, marking the end of summer always makes me nostalgic for the summers from the past.  I usually sit on the porch late monday night as the sun begins to set and just soak up the last few minutes of summer.  It usually gets really cold the following day and lasts late into the next week.  Sometime around the 15th we'll get a week of Indian Summer, and we'll have BBQ's, head to the cottage, wash our cars and cruise around town with the windows down and the music blarring.  Everyone is in better spirits from the heat.  They laugh again, their back in shorts, tank tops and flip flops.  They let you pass ahead of you on the freeway with a smile and wave back at you when you thank them.  Something about the heat and sun in mid to late septmeber that reminds people that we don't have to rush, we don't have to be mean and that we can be ourseleves.  But come October, when the sun starts to set at 7:30 and then 5:30 sometime in November, people become bitter and cynical and hate everything.  Christmas time usually brings spirts back up, but not always.  The mall parking lots are packed and the stores are filled with frantic shoppers.  We all forget what it was like to be a kid and we all forget how great things were in the summer.  I think remembering only brings more pain.  I think being nostalgic isn't for everyone.  I think pushing the past far out of their heads is a better pass time.  Not for me.  Without the past, without my memories, I would be bitter and cynical.  I would hate the world everyday of the week.  It's too bad people don't embrace this long weekend more.  It's too bad not everyone sits on the porch or in a car and just listens to music watch the sunset and just thank God that they had an amazing past.  For this summer to will be in the past and soon forgotten and we will begin the grumpy and nasty state of mind that can only be found in the Fall.  What are you doing this long weekend?  And an extended  HAPPY BIRTHDAY  Kat this weekend.  I won't be here tomorrow, so here it is today....

       Jesus was a homeboy, but not mine    So it happen again last night, I had an anxiety attack while I was trying to fall asleep. I hate it when things like this happen.  I think it started when I was looking in my agenda and writing down appointments and I decided to look up my birthday next year and I saw that it was on a Sunday and I cringed cause Sundays are the worst day of the week.  But that wasn't the reason for the attack.  In 6 months I will be 26.  Only 4 years short of being 30.  I don't want to gorw up, I don't want to join the next phase in life.  I want to be 25 forever.  I want to be bite by a vampire and stay young forever.  And to top it all off, my boyfriend tells me that he is thinking of proposing sometime next year.  I tell him, no need, I ain't getting married anytime soon.  Tell me if I am retarded or not, but is it normal for a girl to be afraid of commitment?

       16 calls waiting   The OC is on tonight. Don't laugh, I watch it.  I watch a lot of shows like that.  I used to watch 90210 religiously, I was there to cheer along side the gang  "Donna Maritn Graduates!!!" , after Donna risked not graduationg after being caught drunk at the prom from having a sip of champagne.  Ya that's right, Brenda Walsh was as bitchy as Kelly Taylor, but I still thought they could have been a little nicer to Andrea.  I also used to religously watch Felicity, which might I add can be seen on Direct T.V.  weeknights at 7pm on WE channel 260.  I'm not ashamed to say that I was there trying to decide if Felicity should have went to Berlin with Noel or if she should have drove back home to San Fran with Ben, I was also there the following September when she was face to face with Noel and he was pissed at her for choosing Ben.  Ya that was me watching and keeping their ratings high, ya I'm not ashamed to admit it.  Just like I can proudly say that I too think Joey should have picked Dawson instead of Pacey when The Creek ended, and ya I cried when Jen died.  So what wanna make something of it?   And I will be there when Seth finally see's that he could be so much happier not chasing rich snobby Summer and instead focus his attention to the cute blonde that asks him out in tonights episode.  And when Seth's neighbour, I can't remember her name right now, realizes that she DOES like bad boy Ryan and not her Ken-look alike boyfriend.  And I suggest the rest of you are there with me to witness this.  Come on Kat, I know you used to LOVE DC, I think you can love the OC just as much......didn't you used to live near there when you were in LA still?    One question for those privilaged to live on the West Coast;  Is Orange County really like that?  All glitz and glamour and big homes and snobby kids?  Seriously I want to know.  Please leave me a comment if you know!  Thanks!

       Fate vs. Veal Cutlets    I wonder sometimes, is there such thing as fate.  Cause really when you think about it, it sounds quite ridiculous.  Take me for example, I was a firm believer in fate, especailly when I got together with my boyfriend, the way things happen you would think it was fate.  But then yesterday as I sat on my friends porch as she washed her car, I began thinking crazy things.  Like, was it planned out for me to prefer a G-string to a thong?  Was it planned out for me to have a job with no direction that forces me to cringe at the thought of coming here ever day?  Was it fate for me to have an obsession with shoes and with bags?  Was it fate, when my sister had a miscarrage in between my nephew and niece?  Was it fate for me to LOVE summer and evidently end up living in a country that only offers 2 months of it?  I ask this because I really think it is weird if while I was in the process of being made for 9 months some 25 years ago, that the dear Lord above was making this list.  Is it just me, or is someone else out there wondering why they like certain things and hate other things and why you prefer a nice hamburger over a veal cutlet.

       Old School and things I thought I left behind    Yesterday I went to our local supermarket  to buy chicken wings to make some BBQ for myself and they have changed the layout of the parking lot.  I got confused.  I hate when things like that happen.  How can you go and change the layout of a parking lot of a supermarket that has been there for 17 years?  Really how am I to adjust to this change?  The sunset early last night, not too sure the exact time, all I know is that when I went to go get gas at 8:37pm, it was already dark.  It's the last week of August and I have pre first day of school gitters.  This weekend I partied and got picked up by a semi-looking drug lord of Latin decent (he was hot by the way) and a man with hockey hair and who was in his mid 40's and by a gentleman who has CES (Close Eye Syndrome).  I ignored all of their cheesy pick-up lines and continued to drink by the bar with my friends and their friends.  Other than that I shopped and looked for a birthday gift for my dad.  I found nothing.  And now the belated Friday Five:   1. When was the last time you laughed?   This morning, I think it was at something I was thinking about.   2. Who was the last person you had an argument with?   Umm my friend, it wasn't anything big, I think it was about the chance of it raining right after she washed her car.   3. Who was the last person you emailed?   My friends and my sister.   4. When was the last time you bathed?   This morning at 7:15am.   5. What was the last thing you ate?   A boiled egg....mmmm mmmm good.

       Hollywood will have to wait   So I stared in a work related video today, well it was showcased today, I actually filmed it last week.  With doing this I know realize that I am not cut out for Hollywood and that I now know why I never got into acting.  So thank you weird video, thank you very much for taking my dreams and flushing them down the toilet.  Now that Hollywood will have to wait, I guess I will have to conquer New York.....

       I remember it well...     Last nights conversation, somewhere between Belview Ave and Glitter Cres:    Me:  So why am I coming to get ice cream with you again?  Her:   Because.....hey there is Jerry's crazy brother....  Me:   Where?  I don't see his creepy stalker car..  Her:   No he's in a truck...ill with my crazy neighbour...  Me:   Who? Horse's husband?   Me:     Or the fat bald dude that walks around spitting phlem on peoples lawns?  Her:   No,  laughs , the other one who lives at the end of my street..  Her: I have a lot of crazy people on my street..  Me:   Ya it's kinda scary...  Me:   Maybe you should consider moving....  Her:   Me!?!  Never........      I think it was about 2 years ago this past May that I visited Vancouver BC and Victoria BC .  It was the second time that I had been out west (the first time being Vegas) and I was on a 3 hour time difference.  I hated it.  I used to wake up at 6am BC time because it was 9am Toronto time.  I would take naps halfway through the day just so I wouldn't fall asleep during dinner.  The same went for my 4 days in Vegas.   But this one day in Victoria, where an old friend of ours was living for school, we went out all day and then came back to the hotel only to shower and the head out to grab dinner and drinks with his friends that he had made living there for the past 3 years.  That night, I remember it was a Thursday, they took us to a club after dinner where we drank, got drunk and danced on top of speakers to my bestfriends favorite song.  We stayed there till about 3 am and then headed to a local sub shop and grabbed a sandwich and told stories about Toronto and all the stupid things we did there.  It wasn't till about 4am that the 4 of us stummbled into our hotel room and passed out on the beds, making it the first time I was ever up for 24 hours.  Back in toronto it was 7am, (my boyfriend at the time called me as he was getting ready for work to tell me that his ex-girlfriend called him, who does that anyway?), so technically, I was up for 25 hours.  Good time was had by all.  I miss those days.  I wish I had more of them here in Toronto.  I remember it well.

       Off Air   I have no music playing in the background today.  Everytime I try to log on to my favorite station, it tells me it is off air.  This makes me mad.  Believe it or not, I can't concentrate without music in the background.  I have a radio sitting at the top of my cubical, but you can't get a signal in here if your life depended on it, as does my work.  Someone quit here today.  I envy her.  I wish I could quit.  Well I can, however she has a new job.  If I quit today I will be unemployed, and we all know how much that sucks.  Besides if I quit today I will no longer have access to the internet, causing this site to remain empty, lifeless and dead.  I can't let that happen and I can't get the internet at home.  It's to expensive and my laptop is too slow, well it's still good, but not good enough.  I need a desktop for my home.  I also need a carpet, couch, coffee table, VCR/DVD player and side table for the room in the basement that I am to furnish to my liking so I have a place to call my own, other than the cramped space I call a bedroom.  My thoughts wonder a lot.  When my phone rings here at my desk, I transfer it to the next unsuspecting customer care rep to handle the call.  I have taken about 15  calls since I got in this morning at 8:30am.  I usually take about 35 by this time.  I have nothing to really blog about today.  I am bored, I am tired and CSI: Miami was a repeat that I have already seen last night.  I went out with my friend to watch her eat a hot fudge ice cream from McD's.  I have lunch in 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It is only for 30 minutes.  Which gives me enough time to heat up my leftovers, walk back to my desk and log back in to "take" calls.   There are 2 calls holdong right now, wait, make that 1.  I don't want to answer either, I just want to get up and go home to sleep or lay in the back on my deck and take in some sun.  This post is boring.  See what happens when I have no music.

       Strange days    For the past few mornings I have been waking up with this nervous, anxious, scared feeling in my stomach.  I wake-up in a sweat with my purple bed sheets sticking to my legs, my hair is a mess and my pillows on the floor.  The room however is cool, dark and the blinds are pulled down from when my mom walked into my room at 1am to make sure that the sun won't seep in in the early morning and wake me up.  My  pajama pants are tossed to the otherside of the room and covering my blue and white PUMA flip flops that I bought 2 summers ago.  Next to that, are my favorite pair of Seven jeans I bought when I had to go to a party that got cancelled and then headed out to a club that was filled with whinny blondes and greasy "studs" that paid too much attention to our tits and ass.  Underneath my jeans is a purse filled with tickets, lipsticks, a pack of gum, lose change and a pack of matches from a resturant I ate at 6 months ago.  There are no matches missing, all 14 are still in place, the cover however, creased and faded from many nights of being dropped, trusseled and thrown into the truck while living in my purse.  They may very well never be used.  I don't smoke. I never have except for those 3 summers I spent lounging by pools and sleeping on park benches and smoking pot.  Summers that were never really there and that never really happend, or so we tell ourselves when we remember stupid things we had done and now regret.  Near the door are my favorite black pointy shoes that have placed a blister on my right pinky toe that throbs with pain and unleashes memories from the hours spent dancing, standing at the bar making small talk with strangers and buying drinks for everyone.  On my dresser is my license and a phone number from a guy named "Paul" that I took to pass on to my friend who thought he was hot and then passed out on the couch in the back corner of the club.  The room is silent and I wake up in a panic and shoot up right in my bed.  I look around, smell the air, look out to see the sun rising outside and see that the clock is reading 5:23am.  I lay back down, close my eyes and try to think happy thoughts.  But I can't.  I try to remember why my foot hurts, why there is make up smugged on my white pillow and why I am sleeping in half of last nights outfit.  I can't keep a steady train of thought.  I can't remeber all the fun I had, all the laughs and all the running we did to get to the pizza parlour before it closed at 4am.  All I can think of is the anxious feeling in my stomach, the paranoid feeling in my gut, and the reoccuring fear in my head.  Everynight it's the samething.  It has been for the past week.  It is having that pre first day of school gitters at the age of 25.  It really only is the pre fall gitters that I always associate with the first day of school and I have been since I have been working in "the real world".  It's the glum look on friends and strangers faces that tells me they are thinking the samething.    Summer is almost over and time is passing way more quicker than any of us expected.   I read about this stuff on other peoples sites and I think to myself that I am not alone, but it doesn't make me feel any better. But that's not the only thing running through my head when I go to sleep.  It's the lingering bills that need be paid.  The parties I have to plan and help pay for.  The gifts I have to give.  The life I want to live.  Although that sounded like a song in the way that it rhymed, it really is something important.  It's having to finally deicide what I have to do with it.  Should I make those pre fall gitters back into pre first day of school gitters?  Should I embark on a whole new life all on my own? Or should I bring someone along for the ride?  It's questions that I ask myself when no one is around to hear.  I wait for answers but they never come.  So I spend my time making lists of things I have to do now and in the near future. Near the bottom of each list is the same task, that reads,  "Take a trip across the states and leave a piece of your past and pick up a piece of your future in every town and city you pass."   I know it will get better, I know I will someday forget about the fears and learn how to let go of the past, but till then, I look forward to sleepless nights, more blisters and a digital camera.

        Light's go out and I can't be saved......      Thursday August 14th, 2003,  I left work for the day at 4pm and told everyone I would see them Friday like I do everyday before I leave.  I drove home on the 407 and everything was great, the sun was shinning, my current favorite songs were playing on the radio and there was not a lot of traffic.  I was happy and I couldn't wait to get home and sit on the porch soaking in the sun.  While I drove my music listening was interupted by static and "other" stations coming through on that frequency.  I was confused.  The radio station I listen to is based in Toronto so I never had a problem with the frequency, so I put the volume higher then lower and then higher again, each time only leading me to different stations.  At this point I was convinced my car antenna fell off somewhere on the highway.  So I kept on driving, hoping that the signal would pick-up eventually and I could go on enjoying my late afternoon drive.  I exited the highway a few kilometers later with a police officer next to me.  The traffic lights at that exit were out.  The officer turned, so did I.  The next set of lights were out, so we went back to a four way stop mode, everyone taking their time through the intersection so not to be hit by an idiot driving at a warp speed.  As I drove to my house I had to pass another set of 4 traffic lights that were out aswell.    At this point I would have been shitting my pants if no one else was on the road with me, everything was eary and it seemed as though the world had come to a screeching halt.  Finally, the radio annoucer came back on the air and said how the power was out downtown, and how it effected all of Ontario, New York, Ohio, Washington and Detriot.  I went home sat on the porch, suntanned and then freaked out when I realized that the television didn't work and that it wasn't going to for the rest of the night.  So I called up some friends and they all came over to my place and hung out all night in the dark, we spoke of the "old days", up coming concerts, the blackout, the fact that none of us had any gas in our cars and that no one had cigarettes or cold beer.  It was nice to be with friends you haven't seen in a while.  Everyone cleared out at about 1 am and I headed to bed with a candle and a flashlight.  I couldn't fall asleep.  I am used to falling asleep with the t.v. on or some sort of light and without it I couldn't get to sleep.  I finally fell asleep at about 2:15am and slept through till the morning when I woke-up to my alarm clock flashing 4:36am, it was really 9am.  I breathed a sigh of relief that the power was back on and called work to tell them I wasn't going to be in.  The power was on for the rest of the weekend, except for Saturday night when it went out again at 1am and returned Sunday morning at 7:30am.  It was this weekend that I realized how having power is a BIG FRICKIN' deal.  I felt helpless and I felt out of control.  These are the 2 things I hate feeling the most.  I think the biggest thing was not knowing when the power was going to come back on, and when I could finally make myself a cup of long overdue coffee.  I also had to live without A/C this weekend cause we were told to conserve energy by not washing clothes, running the A/C and using lights when you don't need to, because we were still in "A State of Emergency".  I had to wait 45 minutes friday afternoon for gas.  Ya, I waited, I had nothing else to do.  Apparently we are still at risk of losing power again and we are to again conserve energy this week.  I am here at work frezzing my ass off in a long sleeve shirt because the building manager decided to CRANK THE FUCKING A/C!!!!!!!!!!!  I hope the power goes out in this building so I can go home.  I hate this place.  Have I told anyone lately?  Well now you know.  Well that was my powerless weekend, how was yours?

       Swing Swing....    Yesterday was one of the hottest days in August, it was about 38 degrees which (for my american friends) is about 101 degrees, but it's not the dry heat you would find in the Nevada desert or the Hilton poolside in Las Vegas, it's the sticky, humid, nasty kind you would find in LA.  I swear I was literally sweating from head to toe, and guess what, lucky me got to make BBQ for the family as they worked inside the house with the A/C cranked all the way up.  As I stood there infront of the BBQ, with a temprature that read, 550 degrees, so frickin hot that I need not convert for my american friends, flipping steaks and cooking ribs and snacking on already cooked lamb, I felt for the first time, sweat dripping down my calves from my knees.  I have never had my knees sweat, I looked down at my khacki capri's and realized that I looked as though I had just pissed myself.... it's times like these I am glad we BBQ in the backyard..... .  At one point I think I became dillusional from the heat, that I swear I heard the ribs talking to me.....  Later that night I went to watch my friends football game, they lost.....they are now out of the playoffs.....till next time.  Also last night I found out that a friend of a friend passed away in a car accdient Monday afternoon.  Turns out that he was drving southbound on the highway and an 18 wheeler that was going  NORTHBOUND  ripped through the gaurdrail and rammed right into his front end, killing him instantly.  I later found out that he was engaged to be married next summer.  That's when I began to cry.  This is one thing that I have never been able to understand or ever will be able to understand.  Why do people have to die at young age, let alone die months before their wedding?  Think of the poor fiance left behind to pick up the pieces and move on  without  the person they thought they were going to spend the rest of their life with.  I don't get it.  How could something horrible like this happen, something so devistating like this, while killers, stalkers and rapists walk the street health and harmful.  Why not kill them off?  Why not kill off the people who planned the 9/11 attacks?  Why give a 6 month year old cancer?  Why kill someone's fiance in a car accident, or better yet at their desk in the office checking email as a 747 rams into the building?  Why do any of this?  And please do not add in the always repeated, seldom true saying, "what doesn't kill you makes you stonger", because I know that if something happened to my boyfriend, niece or nephews I would die.  So I guess it won't make me stronger.  It's times like these I question God's existence, his love and his great big plan.

       A little bit of miscommunication   I finally mustered up the nerve to ask my boss today what I had to ask him, and he said yes.  No questions asked.  I explained everything I had to to him and he just looked at me and said, "Sure!".  So I got up and walked out of his office happy.  I went to sit down back at my desk and I realized,   'wait, that was to easy he must have understood something else and he expects something different from me.'    So I spoke to my supervisor and told her what happen and she also thinks he misunderstood.  So she is in there talking to him right now as we speak.  Now the fear is back.  Now I am scared that they will say no and all my dreams have to be put on hold, and put on the back burner once again.  Only to be forgotten about in a few months and make thier way on to my "Shoulda Woulda Coulda" List, a list that already has about 35 items, and I am only 25.

       Confessions of a would be Beauty School Drop-out    May 16th, 1996.  I was in the backseat of my good friend's green cavalier in the parking lot of my high school and we were planning our prom and graduation.  I planned on wearing a black dress to prom (which I did) and then crash at the hotel with all my friends (which we also did).  As for after graduation, I planned on working for the summer and waiting to hear back from my colleges of choice.  I had applied to 2 colleges for 2 different things; Journalism and Marketing.  One summer night in mid July after hearing that a woman journalist went missing after being called at 3am to report a story, I decided I would not go into broadcasting or journalism.  Right now you are probably thinking it was because I was afraid of all weird things that lurk in the middle of the night that I may be called to report on, and I have to interupt your thought process here, cause it wasn't the reason.   The real reason I decided not to was the fact that she was called at 3am to report something, and I am not the type of person to put their lives on hold just incase I had to go out to report something, I wasn't the type of person you could call at 3am if you weren't drunk and just trying to make me laugh with your random mid morning harrasment call.  So when those schools accepted me, I said   "No thanks kind sir, I am off to pursue a career in Marketing."    Later that week I got accepted into those schools aswell and I decided that come September I would be studying all the great things that come with the world of Marketing.  So Septmeber came, and my first, second and third day passed.  Day four came, and I dropped out.  I hated it.  What the hell do I care about the Economics and Accounting side of making commercials that spoke to people, made them laugh, made them care, but most of all made them think?  It was then I realized I should have been in Advertising.  But what did I know I was only 18 yrs old and my school's guidance counselor wasn't much help.  All she did all day was bitch about her kids with all the other people who worked in the office and pretend to check the system when you wanted to change a course and only tell you that somehow it's already "full".  So needless to say, I made a mistake when I applied to college.  I then, after dropping out of Marketing 101, decided to join the "real" world and put my education on the back burner.  That was 1996, I was 18, it is now 2003 and I am 25.  Do I have any regrets?  Yes, many.  What I realize now is that I missed out on an important part of growing up.  I missed Pub Night, I missed sleeping over at a friends dorm after studying till 5 am for an exam, I missed making college friends, I missed out on great stories of staying up late during exams getting drunk instead of studying cause you knew you were already passing with an 80.  I missed having a grade point average, I missed out on "Back to school" sales and "back to school" gitters.  But most of all, I missed graduating with a degree in something meaningful, and for that I feel like I have nothing to be proud of, and I know I don't.  I have nothing that I can say to myself when things get tough,  "Hey, you can do this, you got through 3 years of college studying (Insert degree here)!  This is nothing compaired to that torture!"   All I have is 6 years working in the "real" world experience working in a job I hate and in a career I was never really made for.  I guess I do have something to offer, advise on "What not to do with your life".  It's better than nothing I guess.

       Fear and a conversation    erin:   Did you ask already?  me:  no not yet, I don't think I am going to, I think they will say no.  erin:  just ask you have nothing to lose.  me:   what? nothing? are you kidding me.  If I ask and they say no, I will go mental being here, and I think sanity is a BIG thing to lose.  erin:  sanity is overrated...see...I'm fine without it...  me:  fine then freedom is another big thing to lose.  I will kill someone and end up in jail if I have to do this job for the rest of my life.  erin:  ok....now we're talkin'....who would be the first?  me:  hmm this is hard, let me think about it and hit ya back!

       Where do I begin?    I am afraid.  I am in pain.  Mostly I am afraid.  I have to ask my boss something that I have a feeling she will say no to and all my dreams will be flushed down the toilet.  So I keep putting it off so that I don't have to hear her say no and so that I won't be in a miserable mood for the rest of my life, and yes this is something that will effect my whole entire life, my whole existence.  I don't know what to do.  People keep saying go ask her, you have nothing to lose.  But I do, I will lose all motivation to get up in the morning. Well enough about that.  I had a very uneventful weekend.  I think the only thing worth mentioning was that I saw  Bad Boys II  saturday night which to my surprise was funny.  Other than that pretty plain boring weekend.  Oh one last thing,  Lays  decided to discontinue Smokey Bacon chips.  So since I have nothing else to say I will give you all my belated  urlLink  Friday Five  :   1. What's the last place you traveled to, outside your own home state/country?   The last place was Vancouver, BC.   2. What's the most bizarre/unusual thing that's ever happened to you while traveling?   Let's see there are a number of things.  When we were in New York walking through SoHo on Mercer Street we had a dude fling a frisbee at us while we were walking and the 3 of us dropped to the floor and then nearly peed our pants from laughing so hard.  Then another night in NY we were followed from Times Square to our hotel and then we had to tell the front door man to help us.   3. If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?   I think I would have to say Hawaii and even LA, then head on down to Australia.   4. Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?   Both really.  I like to fly cause you get there quicker, but I also like to drive so I have more control over the what will happen, crashing, hijacking, ect.....   5. What's the next place on your list to visit?   Well if I could afford it it would be California, but for now I am heading back to New York for a weekend.  My boyfriend is picking up most of the tab, so I can afford that!   urlLink   urlLink

       Flying Solo   It's not what you think.  I am not single again.  So boys, sorry for the 2 seconds possibility of dating me :)  But no, my title comes from having plans, setting goals and not having anyone to share them with.  Well, I have people to share them with, like friends, family and my boyfriend and of course the random visitors to this page.  But for once I don't want to.  Why? you ask.  Well I find that everytime I publisize my ideas, my hopes, my dreams and even my goals, they all fall short of ever even happening.  They either don't get started, or I freak out at the halfway mark, get scared and run off screaming leaving all my hopes and aspirations lying there on a mud filled lawn somewhere on Yonge St. between Wellsley and Gerrard.  So because of this I have opted to keep them to myself not tell anyone and if they notice they notice.  If not then I guess once things are all in order, once I have passed the halfway mark, I will publish this new "me" and you will all know and you will all be able to leave your random thoughts and make your negative comments.  People will only try to discourage me.  My family, well my parents, will tell me not to because of financal issues, a friend who shall remain nameless will put down the idea out of sheer jealousy and jealousy only.  All the points she would make would be invalid to my life and she will only aggrivate the ulcer in my stomach.  Then there are a few others, well 2 others, that have supported every thought and every dream of mine since I began having them.  One being someone who these days is proving me wrong about who really is my "true" best friend.  She is someone who would probably replace my current best friend in the running for my maid of honor one day.  No matter what I think or say, she is always there saying   "Go for it, just go ahead and do what you want, who cares what others think, it's your life!"  .  And for that I love her to death.  You know who you are, so thank you.  Then there is J, my boyfriend, who always tells me that I can do whatever I want and that no matter what he is behind me 100%.  He even tells me that if my parents fears come ture and I fail miserably finacially, he will support me and that he makes enough money for the both of us to be perfectly fine. (Although it bugs me that he does make good cash, I have to admit it is true.)  So I guess that is why I am flying solo.  There are a few here who stop by every once and awhile to read my posts and you know who you are and you to are on the "Supportive List", so thanks chicks!!!  Now I am off to make some decisions, make some lists and get thing approved.  Hopefully good times are ahead.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.  For now, I am off, today, once again is my Friday.  I am off for a long weekend again.  Actually I have every Friday off in August, except for the next one which is only a half day, nonetheless a semi long weekend.    Have a GREAT weekend all!!!!!

        "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"     This is a question that has plauged me for many years now.  Showing up in random converstaions in bars, in interviews and also in the public bathroom stall in the lobby of the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel.  I hate this question.  When asked, my brain completely shuts down, I freeze up and I am left standing there with a dumb founded look on my face, a look that seems to appear more often then needed or welcomed.  It is a question that makes me look deep down inside my soul and see that all I am thinking about that is soulful is the question that always pops in my head,  "Are they ever gonna make a lactose free ice cream that doesn't contain traces of nuts?" , and nothing else.  I can be here at work and dig deep into my soul to find that same answer, even in interviews and especially in the Hilton hotel public washroom.  It will never change.  My mind cannot comprehend such vast soul searching questions.  I have never soul searched for any reason.  I am not even sure if I have a soul left, if I remember correctly I think I sold it somewhere between Las Vegas and Arizona for a few more minutes of sleep, and I don't think I ever got it back.  Nonetheless, soul or no soul, I have never been able to answer this question.  In the bars I tell them,  "Look dude, if you think my future includes you, forget about it now and just walk away while you still have your dignity."   To the man in the stall next to me in the Hilton hotel, I told him,  "Dude, your wearing a dress, but you gotta dick, there is no cocaine in the woman's bathroom."   And to all the woman and men who have interviewed me over the last 7 years I have said this,  "For me there is no 'plan'.  I don't know where I will be in the next 5 years.  I hope I have a job then and I hope that I am happy, but my life long moto, since the day I took my first breath has been, live for today and not tomorrow.  I will forever believe this.  I am a free spirt and no one can hold me back."   Today, I still believe that and I know it will be a stong belief that I will pass on to my children.  Now I ask, where do you see yourself in 5 years?

       Greetings from London   It's Tuesday and I am back at work on one of the busiest days.  I hate when it is busy.  I can barley breath, let alone go to the washroom.  I have been here since 8:30 am and it is now 1:50pm and  I have yet to use the restroom.  Woe is me and this shit job I keep coming to everyday.  So it was a long weekend here and all it did was rain.  I was miserable all weekend.  I even contemplated breaking up with my boyfriend.  He was making me nervous, as was everyone and everything else and I just wanted to be rid of them.  Does that ever happen to you where you just want things to be over and you just want to be single again?  I know it's just a phase (well I hope it is) but I hate feeling this nonetheless.  I got an email from a friend of mine who just moved to London, England for the next month.  I envy her, living her life to the fullest.  I miss her too.  Too bad she had to go, but I guess that's the way life goes.  And now a belated Friday Five cause I was off:   1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?   At about 6:45am.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?   Umm till about 9am, is that late.   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?   Go pee.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?   when I have to shower in the morning, 1 hour, if I shower right before I go to bed, then 20 minutes.   5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?   I have to say Golden Griddle.

       Chalk it up to good grooming...   Ok everyone I am looking for a Apple Pie recipe that is easy to make and that you have to make your own crust.  Anyone know of any???  If you do email me the recipe to pulling_missions@hotmail.com....  Why is it that when you wear a pair of high heeled shoes, or a skirt or a nice top to work, people automatically think that you are interviewing for a job in some other company?  Cause you know I would a) have taken the whole day off, and b) I wouldn't tell any of you loud mouth co-workers anyway.  That's my beef today, because today, instead of wearing black pants, shoes and a black sweater, I wore pointy black stilhettos, grey pants a black shirt and my jean jacket.  Now I thought for sure me jean jacket would make it a bit more casual, but I guess not.  Anyway back to more important things.  For the last I don't know 4 months I have been watching Felicity on the  urlLink  WE (Woman's Entertainment)   channel 260 on direct TV, and I have watched all four season's of the show and I have been religiously watching like as if they have never played it before.  Let it be known that this is probably the 5th time I have watched most of the episodes.  But last night was the series finale and I think I found an error in the last 5 minutes of the show.   urlLink  Kathryn  , you may know the answer to this one, I will break it down for ya'll.  After graduation, Felicity decides to go back home to Palo Alto to study to be a doctor after Ben decided to go off to Arizona to be with Lauren and his son.  He later decides that he should be with Felicity and goes back to Palo Alto to study there with her.  Six months pass and they head back to New York because their friend Helena( I think that's how you spell it) dies in a car accident.  Fast forward to where Felicity see's Ben cheating on her, goes back to New York for Noel's wedding and Megan does a spell on her to make her go back in time to see what would have happen if she decided to be with Noel instead of Ben.  Obviously when she gets back there Helena is alive because she went back 2 years, but instead Noel dies and Felicity decides that she needs to reverse the spell, because by her going back she altered the future so Noel ends up dying.  Anyway at the end of the show she ends up waking up in her bed and it was all a dream, Noel is alive and she never went back in time.  But in the closing scene at Noel's wedding Helena is there and it makes no sense because she died before Felicity went back in time, so technically she should still be alive, right?  Can anyone tell me if I am wrong and if she really was to be alive???

       Matters of the heart   Last night I was having a conversation with a few friends of mine about falling in love and  finding  Mr. and Ms. Right.  Most of them were talking about how they were tired of looking for someone and they were tired of dating people and finding out that they really are not the ones for them.  One friend of mine was telling me how he was tired of meeting girls who were money hungry and who were still into playing games.  He was tired of calling girls only to find out that they were mad at him for not calling earlier and that they always wanted him to spend money on them.  I believe that he also said something about giving up on finding someone.    Another one of my friends finally decided to fill me in on what she really has been feeling lately.  It turns out she was "tired of all the bullshit" that comes with dating.  She was tired of giving out her number to men who asked for it and she was especially tired of going out with them a few times and then not hearing from them ever again.  We both are in awe over this.  She is a very down to earth girl, who is beautiful and not only on the inside, she is equally, if not more beautiful on the outside.  She doesn't play games, she won't smother you cause she wants you to have your own life and still this girl has trouble keeping men.  And I know I heard her say that she was definitely giving up on love, and to be honest, I didn't blame her.  One night while we were out she met someone, and they hit it off, he has yet to call her, but she doesn't care because in the back of her head, this already didn't work out.  Which makes me wonder, when do we let down our guard and how do we know it's the right time to do so?

       4 weeks and counting..   I don't get it, I logged into to my blog account this morning, glanced over at something and all of a sudden my template was changed and I can't get back my old one.  Oh well I guess this one will have to do.  I didn't blog yesterday cause I felt as lousy as I do today.  I have a cold.  Actually I had a sinus infection that I took medication for, but 2 days after the medication was done, it came back.  Why?  Oh why do these types of things plauge me for months at a time?  Other than that I have nothing really to say.

       I need money    I had a good weekend, I even spent most of it with my boyfriend which rarly happens, but I am glad it did this time.  I was at a concert friday night,  urlLink  Sam Roberts  , then saturday I went to a bar with my best friend and we met up with my boyfriend and his friends, then yesterday I spent the day beting on football, having dinner with friends and then realizing that I lost all my bettings.  It was a long fun weekend, well except Friday, it rained here all day, not as bad as they thought, but nonetheless I hate getting wet while I am out running arronds.....  Today is an ugly cloudy day....and I am busy.....but I am off Friday.....I guess that's something to be happy about.......well maybe not........  And now the long overdue  urlLink  Friday Five:     1. Who is your favorite singer/musician? Why?   Hands down, no doubt about it Chris Martin from the band  urlLink  Coldplay  .  His voice, his lyrics, the way he just knows how to put so much beauty into his work....I love it!   2. What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why?   Hmmm this is a tough one....I don't really think I hate anyone, if I remember later I will tell you.   3. If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person?   Of course!  Chris Martin is a generous soul so I think he would be doing something good with his life, helping out the less fortunate getting things done in the world, the man is so amazing.   4. Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show?   Yes I have been to many concerts....I would have to say that the best one, well there are a few,  urlLink  Coldplay  ,  urlLink  Nelly  ,  urlLink  Tool  ,  urlLink  A Perfect Circle   , Nirvana,  urlLink  Chili Peppers   and the list goes on....   5. What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music?   I would have to agree with them, sort of.  I mean it's not right that we are downloading this stuff for free. but on the other hand I hate buying a CD just for one song that I like.

        Where do broken hearts go?  Do they find their way home?     So apparently this  skank  Isabel is making her way into Canada, mainly Ontario, mainly, Toronto and is going to bring with her wind gusts up to 80km/hour and 5-7 inches of rain, what the hell is up with that.  God damn hurricane stay where you are and rightfully belong, somewhere in the ocean, near the US, where these things are like breathing for them, not us here in Canada, where we are used to snow storms and cold weather and not flash flooding.  She better not ruin my plans to go see that concert tomorrow night, downtown, by the harbor front....hmmm maybe I should book a room at a near by hotel, just in case I get stuck in the city...I really don't feel like sleeping in an SUV.  Last night I was hanging out with friends talking about random things, as per usual, and a really weird conversation transpired from one topic, so here it is....   Me:   So your brother's taking off for 3 weeks eh?  S:   Yup, lucky bastard.  Did I tell you my cousin is bringing his girlfriend there too to meet his parents?  Me:   Oh my god, it's about time, what's it been, like 8 years?!?!  S:   Yup, and boy is she in for a shock..  Me:  ....what do you mean?  S:   Well here he has a house that's about 3000 sq feet and a Ferrari and a pool....and there in that small town, well....  Me:   Oh so I see what your saying she thinks he owns a Villa over there?  S:   Yes..(laughs)  Me:   But by Villa you mean backyard, and by backyard you mean a few steps leading to a small piece of brown grass.  S:   precisely!  Me:   Oh Boy!

       Caller ID Blocked   In the past when famous people, actors, actresses and singers, have passed away, I never fully understood how and why people who only knew them through their movies or music cried when they heard the news.  Well that all changed last Friday morning when I heard that John Ritter died.  I can't even put it in words the feelings I was going through, the confusion, the denial and finally the sadness.  It was as if I just received a phone call telling me that an old friend died.  But that was it, an old friend did pass away.  To me friends aren't only the people you can see and touch and be close to.  To me friends are the people who come into your life and leave you with a nice feeling, or a lesson or even just an ache in your stomach from laughing so hard.  And that was exactly what John Ritter has done for me.  He showed me that life doesn't always have to be an up hill climb or a struggle, he showed me that life should be lived to the fullest everyday, but most of all he taught me how to laugh.  It was Three's Company that was the first comedy I had ever watched at such a young age.  He will be missed.  I think if he wasn't on television these days on 8 Simple Rules, I think it would have been a bit easier to deal with his death, but to have one of the funniest people alive brought back into your life again, only to be taken away a mere 2 seasons in, well that something I have only been able to speak about now, nearly 7 days later.  It's too bad that my niece and nephews won't have the privilege of seeing him at his best.

       Again, I have no idea why these things happen...   So I haven't had any access to Blogger and all of the Weblogs I read since last Thursday and I have no idea why.  It's making me mad.  I can't post, I can't read, I can't sleep.  Ok fine the sleep thing isn't Blogger's fault, but the rest is.  It's now Tuesday and not much has happened.  I did have a lot to post about on Monday, but now I have no idea what it was.....damn you faulty systems and software.  I will tell you that I pretty much did nothing all weekend, except for the surprise party we had for my dad...other than that nothing exciting happen.  I did, today, however come to the conclusion that it is time I start acting like and adult (I will be 26 in exactly 145 days) and put myself on a budget and stop spending money like I make millions or something.  I have finally decided to pay off all my credit cards and to cut all my credit cards and to cut all my loses and to only spend money on necessities, like gas, insurance, medicine ect.....clothing is no longer a need, pointy shoes are no longer on my Top 5 list of things I NEED to buy.  So long Seven Jeans and Marc Jacobs bags.  So long Fornarina shoes and Diesel boots....goodbye my fair weather friends....you will be missed but not forgotten, you will forever have a place in my heart and in my closet.  Now on the ever so belated Friday Five:   1. Is the name you have now the same name that's on your birth certificate? If not, what's changed?   Yes and no.  I go by both.   2. If you could change your name (first, middle and/or last), what would it be?    I think to change it to Paris, legally.   3. Why were you named what you were? (Is there a story behind it? Who specifically was responsible for naming you?)   My sisters used to be BIG fans of Charlie's Angels, so when I was born they named me after their favorite one, Sabrina, cause she was the smartest....boy have I put that name to shame.   4. Are there any names you really hate or love? What are they and why?   Hmmm...I hate the name Barbara, just cause....and I like the name Veronica, that's what my mom wanted to name me.   5. Is the analysis of your name at kabalarians.com / triggur.org / astroexpert accurate? How or how isn't it?   Yes actually, very accurate that it is kinda scary.

       It's times like these you learn to live again....    As I drove into work today, all the radio stations were all talking about the samething, the obvious choice of conversation was on the 2 year anniversary that is today.  It was hard not to get a lump in my throat as I listened to them while I drove.  I realized this morning that it's been 2 years since someone's mother or father passed away.  It's been 2 years since an elderly woman waited by the phone to hear from her son who lives on the Upper West Side.  It's been 2 years since they waited for their friends and family to come running out of the towers before they came crumbling down.  It's been 2 years since she lost her fiance, and she still doesn't feel like she can move on.  It's been 2 years since he lost his new wife who was carrying their first child.  It's been 2 years that I realized that life is precious and that we have to take full advantage of the time we have because we never know when we will be called away.  It's been 2 years and I still please everyone else before I please myself.

       It's about flippin' time!!!    What was up with  urlLink  Blogger   and  urlLink  Google   these past few days??  I couldn't post and I couldn't read anyone's blog....was it just my computer and internet connection?   I had all these things to blog about yesterday and this morning and now I have nothing, not one thing.  I can't remember anything I wanted to say....all the funny things I was going to post all the mishaps in my life these past few days....but alas I have drawn a blank and I have nothing to say....hmmmm let's see....  Oh I know what I could tell ya'll.....I was at  urlLink  Chapters   the other night and I bought the book "Sex and the City", by Candace Bushnell, and I started reading it that same night and I am already 5 chapters into the book, ( I bought it Monday night) it is a pretty hilarious book and if you are familiar with the  urlLink  HBO   Series of  urlLink  Sex and the City   then you can understand what I mean by   "HILARIOUS"  .  The writing on the show is pretty much the exact style and tone that Candace uses when she writes so you can see the similarites.  It's funny, a lot of people put down  urlLink  Sex and the City   saying that it is characters are mean, harsh and that the story line lacks any hidden insightful meaning, but I would have to strongley disagree.  If you watch an espisode and don't take away a lesson, or envy or even pitty, then you are not watching it the right way.  Every show you watch leaves you thinking something, whether it is about your own life and how you related it to that episode or if it's admiration for a characters strength and good heart, you are still taking something with you, regardless if the story line lacks the nostalgia of your first crush like Dawson's Creek did, or whether it lacks the drama that is the  urlLink  West Wing   or the ever so obvious comedy that can be found on  urlLink  Friends   and  urlLink  Will & Grace  .  But that is just me and about a million other people who see the good hearts and the humor of Carrie, Charlette, Samantha and Miranda and the best damn show to soon leave the air ways in a long time....  Wow, I should be a critic...........bye for now..........  P.S.  I really really really love Friends and Will & Grace!!

       Football, Football and wait, more football.....    In Toronto most of our main roads are 3 paved lanes running in each direction.  In the far right lane you can always be sure to find a car going 30kms/hour in a 60 zone and everyone behind that car is just fine cruising at that LOW speed.  In the centre lane, you can always find people doing the exact speed constantly, only slowing down when someone from the far right lane makes a mistake and comes into the centre lane.  And then there is the  Left Lane , also known as  "IF YOUR IN THIS LANE YOU BETTER HAVE YOUR FOOT ON THE FUCKIN GAS AT ALL TIMES" , where you can be sure that if the speed is 100km/hour they are doing atleast 130 in that lane.  Now the thing here in Toronto and even Canada, you know that the left lane is used only by those comfortable enough to drive anywhere between 120-160kms/hour, but it never fails that some moron from the right lane comes all the way over to the left lane to continue their slower than ass speed, and I shit you not, they never learn from this mistake.  If and when you decide to make your way into the centre lane going slow, and cut someone off going the exact speed limit that person will be fine with it, they will simply reduce their speed and wait for you to move once you realized you made a mistake, but in the left lane, well then brace yourself.  Not only will they honk at you, but they come so close up your ass that you think they are coming right through your car, and if you don't get out of the way, they will.  You wonder how do I know all of this, well I witnessed this this morning on my drive in to work and I am one of the Left Lane Fuckers, yup I am as agressive as drivers come here in Canada and I would not be afraid to drive in downtown Manhattan if given the chance.  I swear if one other idiot person does this......  Other than that, I am sick.  Today I have no voice and I also have a sinus infection that the dr as given me horse pills to take to get rid of this hidious infection that he told me has plauged my sinus cavaty for 5 years now, so this means no drinking, cause the last time I was stupid enough to do that I passed out after 3 drinks, yup that night I was a cheap date and a huge lush, something I am no proud of.  But this weekend when we hit the clubs I opted to be the designated driver and remain sober while everyone around me drank the night and their problems away.  Now I am back at work and regret not passing out this weekend.

       A long time ago, we used to be friends....   Last night everyone came to my house to celebrate my dad's birthday, they all made a mess and I had to clean it up, that's why I hate these things.  My dad has no clue about the surprise party we are planning for him next Sunday, I love it.  Other than that last night, I hung out with my friend and my nephew who seems to be getting sick, poor thing he is only 2 months.  I think I may have given it to him, because what I thought was just a really bad case of Ragweed allergies, turned out to be a nasty end of summer cold.  Opps!  Passing it to him was the last thing I wanted to do.  So today is Friday and that means it's the start of the weekend.  I am glad that the week flew by, it was better that way, I didn't have to dread coming to work every morning, however this morning when I woke-up I did think it was Saturday, too bad it wasn't.    My plans this weekend are some what buy ones.  I am colouring my friends hair tonight and then we are heading out to watch  urlLink  Grind  .  Then saturday I have a million and one arronds to run for the party and then I have to go shopping with my sister to help her find something to wear and then I have to head to the mall to buy a bag for my boss, she saw mine and really likes it so I offered to pick one up for her.  She's a really cool boss, she is more like a friend really, I think she is the only reason why I am still here.  Then Saturday night we are going bar hopping and looking for some men for my friend.  On Sunday I will probably just stay home and relax, unless of course my friend wants me to add some hightlights to her hair.  And now the  urlLink  Friday five  , it feels like I just posted one 3 days ago, probably cause that was when I did last Friday's......   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   I would have to say I hate to vacum, only cause it's so loud that I can't hear the tv or the radio while I am cleaning.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   I don't really mind dusting or cleaning the kitchen.  I REALLY HATE a messy kitchen, I guess I have OCD when it comes to a clean kitchen.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   I just clean when I think it's needed, however I think my mom has a routine for when she cleans the house.  Me I like to fly by the seat of my pants.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   Not really, well maybe in the way I clean the kitchen, no one else can do it the way I like it.   5. What was the last thing you cleaned?    Oddley enough the kitchen, after everyone decided to leave my house.

       If I could sing, I would.    On today's very special day, we shout a VERY  HAPPY BIRTHDAY   urlLink  Jenny   who is turning 25 and to my  Dad  (sorry no link, he has no blog), who's age I will keep a secret for his sake.  I hope you both have a KICKASS day!!  So I saw my sister and my nephew again yesterday and I swear this baby is advanced.  At 2 months he already makes noises when he talks to you and when you take out a book to read it to him he starts getting all excited and he even watches Paradise Hotel too.  Yup he is quite the advanced chunky mcnugget.  I also happen to notice that each time I am with my sister and she asks me how work is and I tell her how much I am disliking my job these days she starts to offer me some career advice, mainly that I should be on television.  It's strange I used to think myself, that I had the right out going, fun and loud personality needed to be on television, but alas I work here and there are no cameras.  I think I would ratehr be in broadcasting however, instead of being an actress.  I don't really like to act and I do prefer being myself around people so I guess being a host or something like that would be enough.....but where do I begin?  Would I have to go back to school for broadcating even though I don't want to do the news?  Who knows really, all I know is that I now have Friday's off and I have time to figure this one out.

       Shake Ya Tailfeathers   I am back baby!  Where did I go you ask?  No where really, I was just off for a 4 day weekend and now I am back to work and I am glad that I am here.  Well I am not really, but I think reverse psycology will work on my right about now.    So school started yesterday, my nephew went into Grade 1 and he is loving it!  I was even surprised to hear that when he found out his bestfriend was in the other class he was ok with it.  Good for you Michael, be independent from a young age, you'll understand why later.  Long weekend was this past weekend here and now as I drive into work there is more traffic, I have to stop at all the school crosswalks and laugh at the kids and I have to leave my house 10 minutes earlier to make it to work on time.  My allergies have been really bugging me lately and the Ragweed levels have been at an all time high of 9 (out of 10) which is the cause for all the sniffling and watery eyes, itchy nose and ears and scratchy throat which irritates me 24 hours out of the day.  I can now easily say I can't wait for the fall to kick in, that is when this will all end.  Wow September 3rd, is it just me or does eveyone think this summer past really fast.  It seems like only last week I saw all the kids walking home from school for the last time before the summer kicked in and now I see their frowning faces walking back to school, dragging their backpacks and feet.  I feel bad, I always hated school, that's probably why I never went back.  So my weekend was ok, long, but ok.  Friday night I went out for drinks with my friends.  Saturday I had to babysit my neice and nephew and then I made dinner for me and my best friend.  Then we watched a movie I rented,   "What a Girl Wants"   (I know gay, but whatever) and my friend was craving movie theater popcorn so we drove over to the thearter near my house and walked in bought popcorn, walked back to the car and drove home to watch the movie.  Sunday I woke up early and cleaned and then went to the store to pick up decorations for my dad's surprise party next weekend, then I headed out to the mall with my friend and my boyfriend and I looked for shoes and I bought a purse.  I am going back this weekend to buy the shoes, they were $138 and I convinced my boyfriend to give me half.  Then I went home and made BBQ for me and my friends, watched tv and then headed out to a bar to get some drinks where we encountered a slut that broke-up my bestfriends relationship with her ex-boyfriend.  We didn't start anything, instead we just drank more and called my boyfriend and his friends to come by and then pick us up so we didn't have to take a cab.  Monday was pretty much a boring day, I cleaned up and then I went to see my nephew (my other one, Peter, he is 2 months old) and I hung out with him on the carpet all afternoon watching tv.  Then I went home and made soup cause I felt ill, and my friend came over to keep me company, we watched Sixteen Candles on VH1 and then I went to bed and I was up till 4am puking and what not.  So needless to say my weekend went out with a bang.  I am now back at work still feeling ill and contemplating asking to go home early.  Now the belated  urlLink  Friday Five  :   1. Are you going to school this year?   Nope, only back to work for me.   2. If yes, where are you going (high school, college, etc.)? If no, when did you graduate?   I graduated back in 1996.   3. What are/were your favorite school subjects?   English, Marketing and English Media   4. What are/were your least favorite school subjects?   Umm Art, cause I couldn't draw (still can't) if my life depended on it and Gym, I hated having to change in and out of the school's ugly uniform.   5. Have you ever had a favorite teacher? Why was he/she a favorite?    I would have to say Mr. Woods and Mr. Vadeka, they were both English teachers in high school and they both knew how to teach you well and have fun at the sametime.  They also treated all their students as though they were equal and not better than anyone else.  On a last note, yesterday while I went to go get gas, I was standing there pumping gas and I realized that I live in one of those communities that you see on tv, kinda like the OC and like Beverly Hills 90210.  Your either well off, rich or really rich.  Of course I live here only cause I live with my parents, otherwise I would live in crack town or the ghetto.

       Inspiration or desperation?   I was in a meeting here where everyone in there was excited in making this a better place to work and making us a more efficient company.  As they sat there getting excited and involved, I sat there trying to stay awake, under the radar, and thinking  "I HAVE TO GET THE HELL OUTTA THIS COMPANY".   So I got invited to a last minute halloween party for tomorrow night.  I guess I am going.  It should be fun, but I don't think it will be as much fun as  urlLink  Ryan's   and I really wish I could have went to his even though he doesn't have a balcony for me to pass out on.  I haven't decided on what I am going as, all I know is that I HAVE to dress up.  I read some ideas on  urlLink  Jenny's   blog this morning and I really liked a few of them, if I was a guy I would have totally ripped off her cousin Dan's idea for a "chick" maganet.  Other than that this weekend I will be sleeping and hanging out with J and the clubbing aswell on Saturday night.  Just in case I don't get a chance to post again, HAVE A VERY HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND AN AMAZING TIME AT RYAN'S!!!!!

       The History of this Blog.....just in case you were wondering....   Hmm let's see where do I begin.....hmmmm....wait I know.....It all started back in December of 2002 when I was sitting at my desk one day frustrated with this job and it's lack of direction.  I was sitting in front of my computer looking online and I was tired of looking at the same usual stuff, like  urlLink  Instyle.com  , or  urlLink  MSN  , and even my  urlLink  emails  .  So I typed  urlLink  "ihatethisplace.com"   and it lead me to this bitter girls website where she spoke of things I only thought of and where she put up all her opinions whether they are good or bad.  I then went to her guest book where I found other weblogs, I found this one called  urlLink  "everything is everything"   and it belonged to this girl named Christy.  It lead me to one called  urlLink  "Whittle Me This"   who belonged to this girl Alisa.  That lead me to  urlLink  "Me In The Corner"   which belongs to Matt, the one we all know and love and laugh at his witty banter.  That one lead me to a number of different ones;  urlLink  "The Medieval Bestseller",   ,  urlLink  "Geekjive"  ,  urlLink  "One way mirror to the Soul  " and  urlLink  "Sarah Hatter dot com"  .   This one lead me to a whole bunch of fun websites like  urlLink  "Aubrey Sabala"  ,  urlLink  "Dooce"  ,  urlLink  "Willo O'Brien"  ,  urlLink  "Jason Killingworth"   (An amazing writer by the way) and  urlLink  "Jane for Short"   who shares my love for  urlLink  Phantom Planet  .  I read these weblogs for about a month until Jenny told me that I should create my own.  And I did.  I took her good advice and I am happy that I did.  Through reading all these exciting, interesting, witty and intelligent weblogs I have learned a lot about some amazing people and some amazing things.  I have learned a lot about the west coast and it made me realize why I really really really want, no need, to go to California.  And for this, I thank you all.....

       Fast Forward   I really haven't had much to post about these past few days.  I guess it because nothing new and exciting is happening that I could tell y'all about.  The OC is on tomorrow night and I am kinda excited about that, I have to carve my pumpkin to put on the porch for Halloween and then I have to make a final decision about Halloween.  Do I go to a club, do I go to a bar, do I go tick or treating, or should I go egging to loser ex boyfriends houses?  I doubt that I will go egging, the only ex that I would want to egg his house has moved and I no longer know where he lives or if he is living in a condo.  I have no costume cause I decided not to dress up but rather just dress in all black, so people either think I am getting into that car to go to a party or actually breaking into it............ya I like that idea, maybe I will make people think I am going as a criminal........Hmmmm..........  It's only Tuesday and it is gloomy here and all rainy and I keep getting wet when I go outside with my friend while he smokes is cigarettes.

       Music to  my  ears    Last night I was watching Alias and I just love that show, even though poor Sydney is in love with someone who got married because she was missing for 2 years and he thought she was dead, (Damn you Vaughn you should have looked for her!) it's hard for me to deal with her pain, as you can see I feel it through the television.  But I noticed last night, well almost every night that I watch TV, that in dramas there is always music playing the background for a scene and I have recently noticed how the music makes the scene so much better.  The message impacts you more and you feel more for the character.  Like last night at the end of Alias, Sydney goes back into Vaughn's hospital room to get her coat that she forgot and she see's Vaughn's new skanky whore of a wife kissing him and comforting him and you see Syd standing outside of the room with a sad look on her face, and in the background all you hear behind a soft mellow rift, "Don't worry, things will are gonna get easier soon, don't worry things are gonna get better soon....." and I just felt like I was standing in her body feeling her pain, cause I swear a tear rolled down my face when I was watching this happen.  So I just want to say to the people who do this, the behind the scenes work, keep up the AMAZING work you do!!  Your truly the important people on the set!

       I know you need your Friday Fix   Ok so I am off from now on on Fridays and I will try to post on Fridays as soon as I get internet access at home that isn't $55.00 a month.  I think I have to come in half day here this Friday so maybe you will get a quick post then.  My weekend was pretty low key, except Saturday when I was running all over town buying things and looking for things for my living room....long story.....and then I was too tired to do anything that night so I just watched movies on the Movie Channels and lounged and ate cookies.  Sunday I did the same, just that I ate chips and salsa....I have been pretty bummed out lately so I haven't felt like doing much.

       urlLink  Phantom Planet    I really like this band.  If your not sure who they are, they sing the theme song to The OC, "California".  I put this on my wish list.  If you get a chance come see them this weekend in San Fran....they are a really good band.  Other than that I don't have much to say.  Pretty relaxed weekend ahead of me so, I guess I'll see y'all monday morning...........have a good weekend!

       If I traded it all   upon reading other peoples web pages and weblogs I have come to the conclusion that I am not alone when I say that I am lost in my life and I don't know if I have made the right decisions.  I know I wrote a post about regret last week but these past few nights before finally falling asleep I have never ending thoughts about whether or not there is a better life out there waiting for me, and I think there is, I just have no idea where I can find it.  If there only was a way through the internet of course where you could go back to when you made your most significant decision and look at the "other" paths outcome would have been.  Maybe this is something for the developers of Blogger to come up with.  Until then I guess I will have to just sit back with the rest of you and wait.  Wait for the next fork in the road to present itself.

        "Tell them I was a good dancer!"     About 6 years ago I bought a bumper sticker that said  "Jesus is coming, look busy" .  I bought it because I remember laughing so hard when we saw it in the store at the mall.  I just put it away in a drawer and never attached it to my car because I wasn't and still am not the "bumper sticker" kinda gal.  I found it the other day and I kinda laughed, not as hard as I did when I first saw it in the store 6 years again.  I even started wondering what it meant and if it really made any sence.  In 5 months I am turning 26 years old.  Could this have anything to do with it?

       Flashbacks to places I want to be   I can't believe that it is already Monday and that it is already 2:30pm.  I am extremely exhausted today, I woke-up late and I still feel like I am sleeping, I think it is because of all the late nights this past weekend.  Either way I will pay for this all week, since I won't be able to catch up on my sleep till Saturday.  So my weekend, where to begin.....Friday I just hung out at home during the day and gave my room the cleaning that was long overdue and then Friday night I headed out downtown with friends to a club and drank and danced till about 3 in the morning and stumbled into bed at about 4am after driving home and making pit stops for food and vomiting on my friends behalf.  Saturday morning I woke-up pretty early to the sound of hammering and drilling and heavy items falling to the floor.  Since it was impossible to fall back asleep, I opted to get up and leave the house for the whole day.  I went shopping and I went to hang out with my friend while she worked.  Then I made dinner and then headed once again downtown to a club yet again.  It was a different club then Friday nights club.  It was actually the club I had posted about before, under my post " Regrets ".  I had a lot of fun, and it was good to be back there.  The smoky corner where he used to take your information for contest ballots was now filled with posters.  The small room where he ran into me 2 weeks later, now played music from the 80's.  The couch on the second floor where I convinced my friend not to break up with her now fiance was no longer a couch, but rather a "make-out sofa".  The bartender who knew us by our drink orders quit and now works at a bar on the other side of town.  The DJ booth where we used to put in our requests is now guarded by a bouncer and you have to tell him your requests and hope he doesn't mess them up.  The back bar where he told me he liked me and kissed me is still run by the same witch of a bartender who pays no attention to you if you are a woman and she still enjoys flirting with the guys in hopes that they buy her a shot.  The steps outside where you always were able to find me passed out gaurded by the bouncers who later became our best friends is no longer cold cement, but rather fake green grass and the sign above it now says, "NO HANGING OUT HERE, THOSE DAYS ARE LONG OVER", and the bouncers who were our best friends have now moved on to bigger and better things.   And yes of course the bathroom floors still flood after 1am.    When I stood at the bar, I looked around and all these memories, plus many more came rushing back as if no time had passed and I was 21 all over again.  It was nice to be back there and look around and have the ghosts of the past come back and haunt us while we were sitting back on the "make-out sofa" talking and laughing about how things never seem to change.

       I don't really know    Today is probably the first time I have nothing to say.  I have nothing to comment about.  Well I am sure there are things I could comment about on here but I am not sure I want to.  Not beacuse I think it will offend anyone or something like that, it's just that I can't be bothered to go into full detail about something today. I think it has to do with the weather here today.  It is cloudy and cold.  But this morning while I was out of the office it was sunny.  This weekend I plan on getting things done.  I plan on starting to get things ready for Christmas and for the holidays.  I plan on starting my shopping now, before the malls become jam packed with crazy, frantic, insane and rude shoppers.  Before I have to wait 30 minutes to find a parking lot.  I also plan on going out this weekend, everynight, including tonight, which I haven't done in months, mainly cause of money, but mostly cause I can't be bothered to think of some place to go and just hang out.  I figure a bar tonight, a club friday night and saturday night and a movie sunday night should make up for lost time.  Other than that my weekend will be pretty slow.  I will probably end up going out only at night and not during the day to go shopping, I will probably just spend the daytime watching movies on Direct TV and then watching football all day Sunday.  How about your weekend plans?  Anything fun and exciting?

       Regrets    Although many of my nights were spent yelling at the top of our lungs off my friends balcony, "No REGRETS!!", I find that in this day and age and at this point in my life, I have a few, if not many.  Sure I have your basic regrets of not buying those shoes before your size was gone, or not leaving the house in time and now I find myself late again for work, or promising someone you would do them a favor only to realize there are not enough hours in the day.  But these are not the regrets I am talking about.  These are not the life altering things that we should have or should not have done and now you wonder where you would be today if you had made a different choice.  Whether it be about moving to a certain city, or not taking that long overdue vacation, or taking that new job, at times I am sure we all sit back and wonder "what could have been".  It was a Saturday night in May of 2000 and we were at a club celebrating my best friends birthday.  I had been seeing this guy now for about 2 1/2 months and things were going good and I had asked him to join us at the club that night to party with us and help us celebrate her 22nd birthday.  He said yes he would be there.  Later that night while we were driving down he called to tell me that he had forgotten that I had invited him out and made other plans, this pissed me off.  How could you forget something I told you just a few hours ago.  So I hung up the phone told my friends I was pissed off, but I wasn't going to let this ruin my night, so we headed off to the club.    As the night progressed there was a lot of drinking and a lot of dancing and a lot of fun being had.  We were drunk, but not to the point of not knowing what was going on and not remembering in the morning, we were at the point where you would walk into the bathroom and start singing songs by NSync at the top of your lungs and then tell your friends, who by the way you see every night of the week, that they are the best and that you should hang out together more often.  But needless to say we all were in a good move loving the vibe and loving life, regardless of how much an ass the guy you have been dating turns out to be, so I head over to the bar where the bartender knows us by our first names and by our favorite drinks so that I wouldn't have to wait long, because by this time the club had reached capacity and the place was jam packed.  As I pushed my way to the bar, I noticed a rather handsome gentleman headed in the same direction as me, I smiled and he smiled back and we met at the bar.   He looked at me and said "Holy it's gonna be a while before we get drinks."  I looked back at him smiled and yelled out the bartenders name and she came right over, I asked for another rye and ginger and asked him what he wanted to drink, and I remember it was a Miller Genuine Draft, known best here as an MGD.  I smiled at him and said "this ones on me!".   I paid the bartender and started to walk away, he came after me and asked my name and asked if I hung out there often.  I told him my name and told him he could find me here almost every weekend, he laughed and said his name was Chris.  He was hot, and I mean H-O-T!  We talked for a little while longer and he told me he was in a band, told me the name and told me he was playing in a music festival in a couple of weeks around various clubs in the city and invited me and my friends to go check them out.  As we stood there making small talk, my friend, the birthday girl, found me and begged me to go to the bathroom with her, of course she was too drunk to go by herself so the two of us headed to the restroom and I told him I would be back and I would come look for him.  He smiled and I drifted off into the crowd and made my way to help my friend out.  Once we were done I found him off in the back standing around talking to his friends so I went to join them.  They all seemed pretty nice and told me that I should go see their band and that I wouldn't  regret  it.  About 10 minutes later my friends came to find me to tell me that the guy I was seeing had just showed up at the club, it was now 2:30am, he thought this would please me and show that he cared, it didn't, but I felt bad that he drove all the way downtown by himself so I stood there talking to him.  A little while later Chris passed by and told me he was heading out and that I really should come see his band.  I smiled and nodded and told him the next time he needed a drink badly to come find me here at the bar hanging out with my friends, he laughed and winked and walked out of my life.    The next morning, as we all arose in my living room, we talked about things that had happened the night before and filled each other in on things that we didn't remember.  I told them about Chris and about his band, but I couldn't remember the name of the band or where they were playing.   A week passed and I lost interest in the guy I had been dating and decided to call it quits before we got to comfortable and I couldn't seem to get Chris' image out of my head.  I wanted to see him and his band and I wanted to hangout with him.  I regret not getting his number, and now sometimes while I am driving and I hear  urlLink  "Flagpole Sitta" by Harvey Danger  , I wonder what could have been with me and Chris and where my life would be today if I just said something to him that night at the club.    By the way, our paths never crossed again at that club, and I pretty sure in 3 years I haven't seen him just walking down the street.

       I don't get it   Today it is back to summer temperatures.  It is  urlLink  hot  , well not scorching hot, but it is unseasonably warm for the month of October.  Yesterday I was driving home and the temperature in the car read 29 degrees Celsius, I think that is about 89 Fahrenheit, I think.  Either way it was quite warm last night, it made me feel like as though it was summer again, the only problem was that the sunset at about 7:02pm, an ugly feature you can only find in the fall and early winter.    Today women across Toronto are wearing short skirts, tank tops and sandals.  Today I am wearing, black pants, black long sleeve t-shirt and brown pointy boots.  I refuse to give in to the Indian summer, for if I do I will end up with the flu or some other viral infection that I can seriously do without.  So today is my last day before the weekend kicks in!  WooooHoooo I am off, Friday, Saturday, Sunday AND Monday!!!  It's Thanksgiving here so I am off till Tuesday.  I can't wait to have turkey...mmmm....and mashed potatoes....mmmmm.....and stuffing...mmmm.....and gravy....mmmmm.....  I hope to watch some of the movies I listed that I wanted to see, maybe I will go watch Lost In Translation this weekend, I keep hearing is a kickass movie.

       urlLink  Krispy Kreme     I read my horoscope last night and it said,  "Today you will crave change in your career.  If you look in the right direction you will find a new light.  Consider having your own company.  Things are in your favor."   For real?  Cause I was considering opening up my own company and joining the oh-so-cool world of the self-employed.  I have always wanted to check that box on surveys, maybe this is my chance, but what kind of business should I run?  I don't think I can really do anything spectacular that would require my own business, unless of course I am harboring some hidden talent that will surface one day while I am running in the sand along the shores of some beach in Malibu with my boyfriend who I am trying to convince would be better looking if he knew how to surf.  But will it be too late or will it be the perfect timing?  Will I decide to cut our vacation short and rush home to start up this business, or will I just keep running along the beach trying to avoid him throwing me into the water?  Regardless I hope it happens soon, and I hope it happens while I am on the beach.  I love the beach and if it wasn't for hurricanes and the nastiness they have with homes along the shore, I think I would consider moving out to a beach house.  But for now I guess my parents modest home will do just fine.  It just sucks cause my mom won't let me decorate.....  In other news  urlLink  Schwarzenegger   was voted in, a lot of Californians are pissed, and rightfully so.  But if he got all of these votes, enough to win, then I guess that there are a lot of people in California who believe he can do a good job, for your sake I hope they are right.  I guess this really doesn't affect me directly since I live no where near California, but I still feel your pain.  We had to vote for a new Premier here and the guy I voted for won, but now I think that all his promises he made were lies....I guess we too will have to wait and see....   I have to buy my boyfriend a gift and I have no idea what to get him....

       excitement 101    Last night I was watching TV, channel 17 to be exact and it was showing a preview of movies that were coming to a theater near me sometime soon.  It has been quite awhile, but I finally have more than 1 movie I want to see, there are actually 4 and here is my list:   urlLink  Lost in Translation    urlLink  Kill Bill Vol. 1    urlLink  Mystic River    urlLink  Radio   which I think I will see alone because the preview made me cry, I could only imagine what the whole movie will do so I think it be best viewed alone.  In other news, I am now addicted to the show  urlLink   Alias   .  Last season I only got to watch a few episodes cause once I heard that Jennifer Garner left Noel, well Scott Foley, I couldn't watch the show for awhile, it was part of the grieving process.  Once I felt better I totally forgot about the show and missed the whole season and had no idea what was going on and who was who.  Till the season premier preview which said that Sydney was back after missing for 2 years, hearing this I figured I could pretty much pick it up from there and start watching it all over again without being lost.  But the season started off pretty good and it actually made me a obsessed viewer, so now I have something to watch on Sundays at 9pm, well till Sex and the City starts again in January for the final 8 or 12 episodes, then I will have to choose and I am glad I don't have to right now cause it would be a difficult choice to make.  Have I told you lately that I really hate my job these days and that each morning it is getting more difficult to wake-up without crying because I have to come here?  And then I see that  urlLink  Leah   has her own homepage where she talks about her hair and make-up.  What is the world and our youth coming to when they request tips and info form a self-absorbed person?  Just makes me think even less of her.  And I assume that she will be getting some deals to be in movies now that she has had her brush with fame?  Great I can't wait!!!!

       What a weekend.....   I pretty much did nothing this weekend.  Friday I went to IKEA and looked at kitchens that I will never own, then I went to the children's section to play with the cool stuff they have then I left went I fell of this really weird chair.    Then later that day I made  urlLink  Jenny's   Uncle's famous chocolate chip cookies.  Then we headed to the thearter to watch The Rundown with The Rock and with Stiffler and it was a pretty good movie, action packed and it wasn't slow at all, before I knew it the credits were running down the screen....good times....  Saturday I just hung out at home and pretended to clean my room, while the whole time I just laid on my bed and watched bad saturday afternoon movies.....then at night we headed to a bar and just drank away our misery.    Sunday I was "lucky" enough to watch football all day, ya that was fun.  Other than that my weekend was pretty uneventful, maybe this weekend will be better cause it's Thanksgiving...mmmm turkey.....  This was an easy  urlLink  Friday Five  :   1. What vehicle do you drive?   A 2002 Black Ford Explorer, 4 door.   2. How long have you had it?   Since September 2002.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   I would have to say the moonroof and the fact that if you put down the backseat it becomes a bed.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   It's a gas guzzler.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   Hmmm this one is tricky, I'll say the Lexus RX300.

       Happiness:  yours and mine   Last night as I lay in bed trying to fall asleep and while watching the Gilmore Girls on LA's WB, a thought hit me,  'Is anyone really genuinely happy for themselves and or others?' .  On television, on any show, when something good happens to someone, you can bet that their friends and family are genuinely happy for them.  Whether they are sitting there by their side smiling or jumping up in the air for joy, they are really happy for them, but does this cross over into real life?  Do people really feel happy when others get good news, when others win something?  I see the hint of jealousy in everyone, even in myself at times when others get good news, we want that to be us.  But there are times, I'd say 90% of the time that I am truly happy for other people.  Just last week my girlfriend received a phone call from this guys he was really interested in, and it turns out he feels the same way.  I was SOOOO  excited for her that I literally jumped up and down when she was telling me, I thought to myself  "Finally things are looking up for her!"   Sometimes I think I am equally if not more happier about this than her.  Then there is the eternal question of when will I be happy for myself.  When will I jump up for joy for myself for once?  When will I genuinely be happy for my own life and for my own good fortune?  Sometimes I don't see and end in the near future, but most of the time I don't see an end at all.  Which makes me wonder will we ever be truly happy?

        "And all of the girls dreamed that they'd be Ben's partner...."    Last night I was watching  urlLink  The Real World: Paris   as I do every Tuesday night at 10pm on  urlLink  MTV  , and I realized just how much I HATE  urlLink  Leah  .  She is such a loser, that I wonder if now that she is watching this at home, she herself realizes what a loser and a big bitch that she really is.  She has to have everything go her way, if she pisses you off and you confront her, she totally turns it around to make is seem like something is wrong with you and not her.  Last week,  urlLink  Mallory  , another cast member, confronted her about feeling attacked by Leah when she feels the need to tell people she is pissed off and how did Leah react?  She told Mallory how she was wrong and that how on one in her life has ever told her that she was like this, so Mallory must be wrong and that she is not a bitch.  Fine.  Then in last night episode, she does something, and I am not sure what it is exactly, but it makes  urlLink  Ace   think that she is mad at him (which by the way is something that Leah does best).  So he wrote her an appology note and put it on her bed next to a rose and when she found it she felt so bad for making him feel like this and then she went into the confessional both and said that she couldn't believe that she made Ace feel like that and she even said "I can be such a bitch sometimes."  She even genuially felt bad for being like that towards Ace so she went over to hug him.  You see this is how Leah is, she likes Ace and she wants to get into his pants so she is nice to him and realizes that she is a big Biatch.  but when Mallory or  urlLink  Christina   or  urlLink  Simon   tell her she is mean she freaks out and bites their heads off.  THIS IS WHY I HATE HER AND THIS IS WHY IF I WERE TO EVER SEE HER ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK WHEN I GO NEXT MONTH I WILL HAVE TO TRY VERY HARD NOT TO PHYSICALLY HURT HER.   Ok now I feel better......   So it's October 1st, and here on the East Coast it is pretty cold, as I am sure on the West Coast it is still about 79 degrees and you feel as though that is cold.  So I invite you to come spend a weekend here with me and see what cold is...hee hee hee  I forgot to mention that I was at a concert the other night,  urlLink  Queens of the Stone Age  , pretty damn good concert might I add.....

       No no, your not seeing things...   Yup!  The comments are back alright, and what's that you say, it's no longer BackBlog.  Well you are quick and so am I!  That god damn BackBlog didn't want to work for me so I got ride of it and I am now the proud owner of HaloScan, well for now, till they piss me off like the others in the past and leave me sans comments for more than a week!  I even reinstalled it before I gave up and nothing, nothing I tell you.  So here I am, back again with room for you to tell me what you think!  So my weekend....hmmmm where to begin.....well Friday I went shopping and got another gift out of the way and then watched movies all day and night.  Saturday I did some more shopping and got another 2 gifts out of the way, so now I have....let's see....3 or maybe 4 more to purchase, but these won't be hard.    Then Saturday night we went to a few bars and drank ourselves silly while we sat around making fun of all the people who walked around like they owned the place and thought they were the coolest people around.     Sunday I stayed in bed all morning and then got up around 12pm and headed out to visit some friends who I haven't seen in a while and hung out with them all afternoon.  Then I went home and showered put on my most comfortable clothes and sat on the couch till I headed up to bed.  and that was my weekend, pretty boring.  Nothing exciting ever happens here, especially in the winter.  Oh and one last thing, how come the U.S. is so bloody lucky to be off for 4 days for Thanksgiving??!?!?!??!  Now I REALLY have to move to California or New York.

       What's up with my COMMENTS not working?   I forgot to mention this but 2 weeks ago I FINALLY got my digital camera!  Yup, that's right, I can now take pictures and email them to friends and family....maybe even leave this blog and start a new one, maybe use  urlLink  TypePad  , you know change things up a bit.  I don't know what will become of this site, but I can only say it will be better in the end, whenever that is....  So nothing really new and exciting is happening at the moment.  I am kinda bored and I am looking for things to do this weekend besides shop for Christmas gifts and taking pictures....  I'll see ya tomorrow I guess......

       No seriously, I really am like this   I have a hive.  On my left wrist, the inner part, the one which displays all your veins and the area most often used to kill yourself.  It is the most itchy part of my body right now that I am afraid to keep scratching because the skin is so thin that I might draw blood, so I am running it under cold water, that usually helps.  In other unrelated news, I am trying to learn how to sew from my mom, and can't.  My brain no longer can grasp new concepts and I can no longer claim on my resume that I am "a quick learner".  I officially suck!  She tried to teach me how to knit last year and I couldn't do it then either.  I think I am getting old and my ability to learn new things has disappeared.  See I know this for a fact cause when I was 7 my grandmother taught me how to knit like nobody's business and I was good.  I used to only knit scarves (come on now I was only 7) but dammit they were nice scarves.  Now, well now I can't even hold the needles properly.  I wish I could blame this on a glamorous life filled with late night drinking and weekend drug binges in a scummy downtown Las Vegas motel, but I can't.  I am simply and boringly (if that's even a word) blame it on old age.  Woe is me....sigh....

        "My God woman!"    So this weekend I took pledge to start working out, starting today.  I decided not to tell anyone (well so much for that) because I find when I tell people they say things like  "Ya ok, just like last month!",  or  "Ya right, did hell freeze over or something?"   And although true, these statements at times can be very discouraging.  So I decided to just keep it to myself, well except for you fellow bloggers.  What brought me to this decision you may be asking, well it's not the usual,  "I need to drop a few pounds" , although that is a nice perk, but the real reason behind this hideous decision (and if you know me well then you know why this is a hideous decision), it's kinda embarrassing, but I guess I will share.  The bottom line, I AM SO OUTTA SHAPE!!!  The embarrassing part you are wondering, well I was at the movies Friday night watching Elf and as I made my way up back up to the top where I was sitting, I decided to skip a few steps and taking 2 or 3 at a time in order to make it to the top before the lights went off and the movie started.  I didn't fall or anything like that, but Saturday morning I could barley walk when I got out of bed cause I had pulled all my muscles.  So my shopping experience wasn't the greatest.    To further punish myself, I went bowling on Saturday night with my boyfriend and his friends....needless to say I SUCK at bowling and only scored a measly 68 twice.  Sunday morning yet again was a struggle to get out of bed, but this time not only did my legs ache, I had now pulled a muscle in my right shoulder and forearm.  It hurts when I type for a long period of time, so this post took 2 hours to do.  I did some Christmas shopping this weekend and purchased a box of cards that I will mail out to friends, some of you reading this will get a nice surprise in the mail come mid December.  I bought 5 out of the 12 gifts I have to buy.....7 more to go......37 days to go till Christmas...

       Walking in A Winter Wonderland.... I guess    It's snowing here for the first time since last winter.  No one was ready for this so this means that no one will know how to drive tonight on the way home from work.  Oh woe is me.  I haven't written in a week or so, which is unusual for me cause I used to post everyday.  But I am back, for now, I guess.  This time of year is always hard for me to stay focused, stay positive and stay happy.  November is always a hard month for me.  I can never seem to see the silver lining or the light at the end of the tunnel.  But there is hope, December is coming after all and it's almost Christmas which is one of my favorite holidays.  So I guess I have some things to look forward too.  I was thinking of starting my Christmas shopping this weekend, you know, gifts, decorations, gift wrap, ect.  I just hate putting it off till December when everyone else has decided it's a good time to start shopping.  This way come December I can focus more on wrapping and baking and visiting.  Nothing else new is happening here with me.  Nothing worth mentioning anyway.  How are things with you?

       When the going gets tough, it's time for me to go   Do you ever have those days when you are tired of it all and you just want to give up the fight and just settle for what you have, win or lose?  Ya, well that is me today.  I am tired of this all.  Even tired of writing in this blog.  Tired of checking it for tickets to concerts.  Tired of driving.  Tired of working.  Tired of being tired.  Tired of just everything.  Maybe I need a break from it all.  I no longer think that the weekend is long enough for me anymore.  So I guess I am leaving this place (well this blog) for awhile.  No hard feelings towards anyone.  I am just to negative these days that I think it in all of our best interest if I don't post for awhile.  If you want to reach me, you know my number and my email address, if not just ask, I'll tell ya.  Take care and have fun.

       Just like that night you had your first kiss.....          My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me.      So won't you kill me, so I die happy?      My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury,      Or wear as jewelry, which ever you prefer.       Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember      always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights      The scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers      And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late      And this walk that we shared together            The streets were wet, and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and let you in            And you stood at the door with your hands on my waist      And you kissed me like you meant it      And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it     **Dedicated to the last night in NYC atop the Empire State Building at sunset in the summer of 2000, looking over out at the Lower Manhattan skyline.

       One thing after another    I know I keep saying this and I am sure you are all tired of hearing it and I know I should do something about it and I know I am not the only one going through a quarter-life-crisis, but my god I am so sick of all of this.  It all sucks.  All of it.  I hate it all and I want it all to go away.  I know I am being childish and negative but I am surrounded by awful things.  For one, it get's dark here now at 5pm, dark, I mean dark that you need to turn on the lights in your house or else you won't see anything.  Second, it's raining, it has been raining since last Monday, except for when it stopped on Halloween, but started again Saturday.  They say it is going to rain all week, until Saturday when the tempurature will drop to zero and it will change to snow.  Third, I have no money.  Seriously I am a broke-ass.  I have bills to pay and no money to pay them with.  Foruth, Christmas is coming, sooner than we think.  Please refer to #3 to understand why this is a problem.  Fifth, I am having a hard time getting up in the morning these days.  I hate coming here.  I hate it some much I contemplate jumping off the house so that I won't have to come here.  I need a change.  Sixth, I can't seem to find a new and somewhat better job.  There are none, and the ones you apply for are all from agencies and the jobs they post are BS, they only post them so that they can get you into their database.   ROTTEN!!   And last but defintley not least, my god damn comments are working and this coke is giving me a stomach ache.  So that is my complaints in a nutshell.  I wanna go home and I wanna cry, seriously I think the crying will happen soon.

       Are you busy today?  Cause I am....    Wow what a weekend!  Let's see.....I will start with Friday, and Friday started with me waking up and going all over town looking for a Halloween costume.  Did you know that you are not to do this on Halloween cause you will only find shitty leftovers?  Well I knew this, but I didn't find out about the party till late Thursday afternoon.  So I had to take what I could get without looking like a tramp, so I went with angels wings and a halo.  I know, lame and unoriginal, but hey what do you expect from a last minute excursion to the party store?  The party I went to was fun, we danced, laughed and drank till early Saturday morning, I think it was 4am when I rolled in.  Someone took too many pictures of us that I am sure are incriminating if you were not at the party and you are looking at these pictures and no one is telling you the story behind them.  If I can post them I will, if not I will just have to show you when I see you one day.  But all in all it was fun, not as much fun as I am sure that you all had at Ryan's party....tell me stories and show me pictures please!!!!  Saturday afternoon I headed to the mall in search for a pair of jeans that fit me as well as  urlLink  Seven jeans   do, but I didn't find any, I did however find that  urlLink  Seven jeans   have no been increased to anywhere from $225.00 to $283.00 per pair (of course these are CND prices, god forbid I paid US prices).  I hate them and I will no longer support Seven, as I am sure that they don't care because I am sure there are a lot of people who will still enjoy spending rent money on jeans.  Needless to say I was depressed, so I bought a pair of red shoes instead and then when I went to a lounge Saturday night I wore them with my red purse.  It was fun.  I tried not to stay out too late Saturday night, but that didn't happen.  I was out till 5am cause we stopped off at a hotel party on the way home.  Then me and J came home and passed out on the couch.  I woke-up Sunday morning at 10 and made a HUGE pot of coffee, changed out of my clothes from Saturday night and put on my jogging pants and laid on the couch all day with J and watched movies.    I would have to say that this was the best part of the weekend.  Later Sunday night he went home and I watched Alias and then the Simpson's and Malcom in the Middle.  Is it weird for a 25.5 year old to still watch the Simpson's?  Yeah, I didn't think so.........

       No Such Thing   Yesterday while at the mall I picked up the  urlLink  John Mayer   CD,  Room For Squares  and it has been in my CD player ever since then, I have been listening to it since took it out of the plastic wrap that ensures that no one will steal it.  I am even listening to it now while I am writing this post.  Today is Christmas Eve and I am at work, I know it sucks, but hey, this is the real world after all and here, you really have no say in the important things.    In one of John Mayers songs he sings about the real world or better yet life after you graduate from school and in a verse he says  "Welcome to the real world" she said to me condescendingly, take a seat, take your life, plot it out in black and white"   and then goes on to sing,  "They love to tell you stay inside the lines, but something's better on the other side."   So I guess this is what I am wishing everyone, instead of a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, I am wishing you the complete opposite of what he is singing about and instead, what he is trying to tell us.  Be safe and have an amazing time during the holidays.  All the best to you and yours in 2004!  See you in the new year,  Paris

       So this is Christmas and what have you done.........    Holy can you believe it is Christmas Eve tomorrow already????  Wow! where did the time go??  I swear it was July just last week.  Maybe it doesn't feel like it cause there is no snow?  Or maybe because it's raining or maybe because I am getting old and time is flying by and because Christmas just isn't the same anymore.  Well I still have no plans for New Years Eve, we all can't be as lucky as Kat who will just chilling down in Mexico......lucky girl....I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON!!!!!!!  I had something awful for lunch, now I feel awful.  Oh well......  So if I don't get a chance to post tomorrow since I am only in a half day, I hope you all have a Merry Christmas and to Kat, I hope you have a great New Year and a safe trip!  You too Jenny since your heading out somewhere on Friday......have fun....where ever you will be!!!!!!

       This might be the last one....    So I decided that starting January 1st, 2004 I am going to turn over a new leaf, start a new chapter, get my ducks in a row, you know  get my shit together.   I was thinking about this for the past 3 weeks.  I am going to be 26 in a few months, isn't it time I started taking things a little more seriously, isn't it time that my daily routine involved things that made me happy and things that I   wanted   to do.  So I did exactly that, I composed a list of "Things to do in 2004" and a few things on this list were exercising, eating better, being more health conscious, finally dealing with all my health issues that have been sitting on the back burner for more than 8 months now, but mainly I need to get a new job, I need to get out of this field and I really need to start taking more risks.  So in doing all this, start January 1st (or 5th, depending on when I post for the first time in 2004) I will start posting about my journey to being the person I really want to be.  No more unhappy thoughts, no more negative words (well sometimes, a girls needs to vent every once in awhile,  no? ), just happy findings on my journey.  I may even redesign this whole site, I may join movable type or blogger domain, I may even post pictures... gasp!   Stay tuned, if you want, a new "Next Stop Arizona" coming your way soon.......and I may even change the title......again!  Paris

       I need more water    Yesterday night when I got home from work, I had a wonderful surprise, a Christmas card from  urlLink  Jenny   and it was a BEAUTIFUL card that was made from one of her very own paintings, and if I wasn't such a retard with computers I would take a picture of it with my camera and post it so you all could see how talented Jenny Smith really is.  In other news nothing exciting really has been happening.  Sunday it snowed (finally) making it look more  "christmasy" and making me enjoy this cold, frigid weather we have been having.  I still have no plans for New Years Eve.  If I had my way I would either fly to New York City or Las Vegas to ring in the new year in either city, but I can't, my job sucks, I can't get time off work to do anything but bum around at home, alone and depressed.  Good times ahead, good times ahead.  What are your plans?

       Best of 2003   Like every year at this time, me and my friends compose a best of (insert year here) list that we share with each other just to think back and remember the good times we had and all the good things that came out of that year.  It's been a tradition now for about 4 years, and despite the fact that we barley see each other anymore, we still manage to do this and email one another.  I decided to also post mine here in hopes to start another trend via my weblog.  Here goes.....   Best Month:   June  Best day of the week:  Fridays, I don't work on Fridays  Best Day at Work:   The day 5 of us took the Beverly Hills 90210 quiz and Robert got the highest score.  Best Night Out:   The night we were chased 5 blocks by a group of drunk pissed off guys.  Best Day at the Beach:   The day we swam out to the deep deep end and Matt made us laugh and we all couldn't swim back.  (trust me if you were there you would know it was more funny than scary.)   Best Gift:  Hands down my digital camera  Best Drink:   Chocolate Martinis  Best Movie:   Old School and Finding Nemo  Best Concert:   Coldplay and John Mayer  Best New Show:   The OC  Best New Ritual:   Watching the OC on Wednesday nights with my friends  Best Use of Video Camera:   Driving through the snowstorm/blizzard back in January and the night we drove around honking at cute boys back in July.  Best Fight:   At a bar with a White Trash Stripper......good times....good times...  Best Photo with Digital Camera:   All 6 of us standing on the corner of King and something, all 6 of us way too drunk and doing different things, including Josh doing jumping jacks.  I am sure there are more, but this is all I have so far.  I will add more when I think of more.

       Las Vegas here I come....again, for the third time......well in 4 years...    In 2 months I turn 26, and in 4 years I turn 30.  I have decided that for my 30th birthday me and J are heading to Las Vegas since his 30th birthday is right behind mine.  Seeing as when I am 30 I will own a home and have a HUGE mortgage, I have decided that starting the day I turn 26 I will open up an new account putting away $50-$100 a pay (depending on what bills I have that month) for the next 4 years.  I have calculated that over that time if I put on average $75 a month I will have saved up roughly $3600.00 not including the interest made on this over the 4 years.  So I will have $3600 (give or take) to surprise him  with a 4 day trip to Vegas for our 30th birthdays!  A nice surprise,  no?

       New Years Eve   The year was 1997 and I was 19 years old.  It was the second year that I was spending new years eve with friends and not my family.  The year before we all were to young to get into a licensed club/bar so we opted to just hangout in a penthouse of a near by hotel.  So this year was exciting, this year we would drink in the club, this year we would be dancing to music while we counted down, this year we were adults.  Our plan was from the beginning to meet up at Andy's house and then take only 2 cars downtown to the hotel we were staying at, get ready, eat some dinner, and start drinking then so that not a lot of money needed to be spent in the club.  At about 10:45pm and about 2 cases of beer later, we decided to leave the hotel and head over to the club which was about 7 blocks down the street.  We started to walk in hopes that the 7 of us could hail ONE cab, on the busiest night of the year for cabs in one of the busiest cities.  Needless to say no one would take the 7 of us and it was to risky to leave anyone behind to wait for the next cab, cause chances were that there wasn't going to be any other cabs.  So we walked, 7 blocks, to the club, in the blistering cold that was about 25 degrees below zero with the wind chill.  But we laughed, took it in stride and made the best of it.  Once we got in the club, we all felt sober, I guess the cold does that to you, so after we checked our coats we made our way to the bar so that we could bring back that good feeling we had earlier in the hotel room.  We drank and drank and finally we warmed up, and finally our wicked buzz had come back, now of course after downing another 3 or 4 drinks each, well you could imagine how drunk we were.  So we danced and danced and drank all night long.  The floor shock underneath our feet each time we jumped up and down, it felt as though we were going to fall through, but we didn't care.  It was New Years Eve, in less than 20 minutes it was going to be 1998, "1998 can you believe?", we shouted at one another while we danced around to Prince's "Little Red Corvette".  The countdown began and Lisa and Matt who were at the bar ran over to find us and we all shouted "9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!" in unison like 5 year olds at a birthday party.  We all hugged and kissed and laughed, drank champagne and danced till about 4 in the morning.  Tired and staggering, we all walked back to the hotel, laughing at when Josh and I thought the floor was going to cave in, or when Lisa banged her head on the bathroom stale, when Dave kicked a cup that was lying outside of the club and then fell.  When Matt locked himself in the bathroom and couldn't get out and Josh, Lisa, Eddie and I couldn't help him cause we were laughing to hard.  When we finally made it back to our room, I believe about 45 minutes later because we all kept stopping to either laugh or throw up in a corner or a garbage bin, we were all so hungry, so we ordered a pizza and  chicken  wings (just in case Jessica Simpson is reading this and thinks I ate buffalo) and hungout lying in bed eating and watching cheesy music videos on MTV until we all slowly started falling asleep around 6am.  The next morning I remember waking up at 8am to find Lisa awake and lying in bed next to me Josh and Eddie (we were only 19, no one worked full time so no one could afford more than one room so we had to sleep 4 to a bed, luckily we were all just friends), looking out the window at the snow blowing off the buildings next to us.  We looked at each other and smiled, grabbed the phone and ordered room service for all of us.  We checked out at about 11am, so we could all make it home in time for our Lunch/dinner with our families.  On the drive home I remember all of us talking and sharing things that we did that some of us couldn't remember.  We all shared our thoughts, as different as they all were, since we all had different views of the events that took place the night before, but one thing was the same no matter what, that was the best night we had ever had, even though it was all planned last minute and by that I mean the morning of December 31st.  Six years later and I am still reminded of this one New Years Eve when everything was good and when we all made plans together.  This year will be different, just like the past 4, that could never even come close to that night.  Most of us won't be together, wait actually none of us will be together, and it's sad, and I want to go back and I know I can't.  But me and Dave were just saying last night that we both would give anything to see him again fall from kicking a plastic glass on King Street at 4am.

        Because I haven't in such a long time...........      urlLink  The Friday Five:      1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?   Yes, I love it.  Usually when I am in a bad/sad mood, buying something makes me feel better, even if it's just temporary.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?   A gift for a friend, a sweater.   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   I prefer shopping in an actual store, only cause I don't trust giving my credit card number to a website.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?   Nope.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?    Hmmm, regret, probably a pair of shoes I only wore once.

       Hello my name is Paris, and I need a reality check   When I was younger, I used to think that you could do whatever you wanted no matter what, as long has you had enough courage and determination, your dreams would come true.  These days I can't help but think that maybe we don't have all that control over our lives that I thought we had as a young girl.  I am not trying to be negative, really I am not, but due to some circumstances over the last 10 years, I have come to realize that a lot of our live changes and choices all lie in the hands of fate, destiny and the man above.  In certain instances I have seen something I had thoroughly planned out turn in the opposite direction only to have something fun turn into a disaster.  I have planned on going certain places at certain times, only to end up in a different location, about 3 hours late.  I have planned on enjoying a day at the beach, tanning my little butt off, and returning to the city just in time to watch the sunset over my house while I sat on the porch with friends drinking, but only to be home nearly after midnight due to an accident on the highway, my accident, where I totaled the car I planned on going cross country in the next summer.  I had to get a new car, leaving me penniless and living paycheck to paycheck, leaving me no choice but to cancel the cross country trip and spend the summer working long hours on hot summer days.  It was sometime that year that it finally hit me that I don't have control over anything and that everything is based on fate.  This past weekend I saw an old friend of mine at a bar.  I haven't seen her in over 4 years.  I lost contact with her, well no, she actually lost contact with me.  Either way, hadn't spoken to her or seen her or heard anything about her in awhile.  Just last week while writing out my Christmas cards I came across her address in my address book and thought about sending her yet another card, just to let her know I was still thinking of her.  And then it happen, I saw her.  We both didn't recognize each other at first, but soon after we were talking like two best friends that didn't have 4 years of no contact between them.  Later I wondered if this meant anything.  If things do really happen for a reason, what was the reason for this?  Why did I see her this weekend?  Why did I decide to go out instead of staying home?  What meaning did this have in the rest of my life?  I don't know the answer and I don't even know if this had a particular meaning.  All I know is that if I really do have no control and have no say in the way things are going to be, I really hope destiny guides me to have  urlLink  "Trouble"   by Coldplay playing in the background when I go.

        Don't you want somebody to love?     Last week I was sitting at a bar and the bartender kept trying to hit on this girl who obviously didn't want to give him the time of day.  He was pretty good looking, nice eyes, sweet personality, and thick chocolate brown hair.  He was a looker alright, but still she just took her drink walked away and never came back to that side of the bar.  He looked at me because he knew I was watching this, and he just smiled shrugged his shoulders and walked off.    My heart kinda went out to him.  I felt bad.  As opposed to all the other bartenders in this world, he didn't seem like he was looking for a one night stand, he looked like he just wanted somebody to love and to love him back.  Which brings me to Average Joe.  I don't get that girl.  So what they bring on 8 good looking men and all of a sudden you forget the bonds you made with the other "average" looking guys?  The 8 "lookers" we will call them, were your typical jocks, looking for some ass and an easy  fuck .  And like a typical girl who chooses beauty before sweetness, she melted for all of them and fell into the trap and made the "average" (which weren't that average looking, they were cute in their own way) feel really bad about themselves, and for that she should be kicked off the  "island".   Why you may be wondering why this bothers me so much, well it cause I hate reality tv shows, and cause last nights episode made me cry a little.

       Something borrowed, someone new    Last night I posted before I headed out with some friends for drinks.  I posted about time and about how everyone I knew on the web was 3 or more hours behind me.  While I sat on the bar stool last night it occurred to me that here it was 11:45pm and somewhere on the west coast it was only 8:45pm, people were still getting ready to head out for the night while I was already 4 drinks into my night.  Then it hit me, I am a lot more interested in the lives of people online then of the people sitting right in front of me.  Are they just boring, or have I become one of the millions of people who find technology a better way to communicate?    That being said I came home and surfed the net, downloaded some pictures and contemplated which photo printer I was going to buy in the coming weeks.  I thought nothing of what had just happen at the bar, I just sat here wondering where everyone who's blogs I read were heading out for the night or where they were at that exact moment.  Here it was 2:30am, but somewhere in LA and in Nevada, even Vancouver, BC it was only 11:30pm and people were either 30 minutes into the late show at the movies or standing in line at hot club on Sunset Blvd.  For a minute I was envious, then I was actually curious.  I had only seen pictures of the Los Angeles and I have only spent 4 days in Las Vegas, but part of me wished I was there living the lives of the people who post about them on their blogs.  I wish I was on the West Coast.  I know your thinking that if I was on the west coast, I would wonder what is going on on the east coast, but to be honest, I do wonder every now and then what the people in New York City are doing.  What the temperature in South Carolina is and what the southerners are doing in Georgia.  I am fascinated by other peoples lives, a voyeur if you will, who is looking for inspiration in her own life.  Sad it may seem to some, but to me, I am just trying to make sense of it all, trying to put the pieces together.  Really trying to decide what flight I will leave on in May.

       Frustration    It's snowing here again.  It's been snowing on and off for the past 3 weeks.  I am sick of snow. I am OCD (mild case of it anyway) and do you what it means to be OCD, have ADD and it's snowing?  Well I will tell you.  I compulsively feel the need to shovel the driveway all the time.  Even if it is not that bad, even if there is just some random snow or slush anywhere near the driveway, I HAVE to get out of my car and shovel it before I go anywhere, even if it means that I will be late for work.  As you can see I am still using this as my weblog, I haven't changed it and frankly I am giving in from frustration.  I can't get it to work and I am just going to give in and quit!  That's right folks I am a quitter!  And I don't care.  So if you want to see a picture of yours truly or pictures of crazy adventures I have been on since purchasing my digital camera, you'll just have to wait, or leave me a comment and I will email you them.    Last night as I was trying to figure out how to do up a new website I was watching the OC and I realized that I am addicted to that show, along with a few others.  I realized that almost every night of the week I am obsessively watching a television show.  It goes like this:  Sunday - Alias  Monday - The OC  Tuesday - The Real World San Diego  Wednesday - Gilmour Girls  Thursday - Friends and Will & Grace  Friday - Joan of Arcadia  (then I go out)   Saturday -  doesn't count, I am never home Saturday nights  Sick, I know, how I have my week planned out, and I am lucky that I can even sit through an hour to watch most of these shows.  Oh and on Sunday mornings, I was The Royal Tenenbaums or Old School.  Here is a list of movies I still want to watch:  Lost in Translation Torque Win a Date with Tad Hamilton Along Came Polly 50 First Dates  Ya I am crazy I know I jump from story to story, from list to list......I gotta go now, a fresh layer of snow just covered the driveway....

       Update    As you can see I am posting at 8:30pm Toronto time, and no I am not still at work, I am at home typing this on my new black computer (I say "black" cause I LOVE this colour) with my shit dial-up AOL internet access....this is really slow, I guess that is why it is taking me so long to actually get a web page up.....but it is in progress and it will be up soon, sometime this year.....hopefully.....unitl then.....   Dear Sarah Jessica Parker ,   I was watching the newest episode of Sex and the City on HBO this past sunday, and I was wondering if you noticed that one of your outfits was very similar to one you wore in Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, circa 1985ish?  Your Friend,  Paris

       Out with the OLD in with the NEW    In the early morning of January 1st, 2004, I was thinking, it's the first day of a new year, a new year to change things, change my career, change my attitude, grow up a little and express myself.  The bad news, as there always is some, this will be my last post here.  The good news, I will be back, with other exciting things, with pictures, with stories, with a real identity.  All this with the help of Type Pad a division of Movable Type.  How long will this take? Ah I say a few weeks, I need to get a new computer at home and an internet connection at home to and then I need to start this all up.  But in the meantime, this site will be up and running still, maybe I will post the progress of this new site and of course, finally when it is done, I will be back to redirect you all to the new and improved pulling_missions........till then que sera sera...Happy New Year.....drop me line sometime........pulling_missions@hotmail.com......don't worry, I don't bite!  Cheers,  Paris

       When is late, too late?   How long do your 15 minutes have to be for them to make a good, E! True Hollywood Story about you?  Can it even be 15 minutes, or do you have to have a semi-lifetime acting career, or a career in the spotlight, that long exceeds both those of The Rolling Stones and Audrey Hepburn?  Do you need the “Triple Threat”, or can a mere stint somewhere in the newspapers get you one?  These are the questions that have plagued me all day.  In the mail today I received a card from my co-workers, well ex ones anyway.  Inside were all their well wishes, how they will all miss my loud voice ringing in their ears as I walk in each morning and all the things I did just to make them laugh.  It was like they all had a sample greeting emailed to them before the card was passed around, nonetheless it did the trick and I was glad to receive this on a day like today.  But there were 2 that stuck out the most, both were from to ladies who knew me well and who knew how much I hated being there and how much I hated being attached to a phone and desk for 8 hours a day.  At the end of their generic greeting each wrote this;   And there they were the 9 words that have been said to me over and over for the past 10 days,  here is your chance to do what you want .  In the beginning these words were encouragement, these words the glimmer of hope I looked for every morning, these words were what made me realize that the company did me a favor by the restructuring.  But now, today, as I sat there reading the card in front of my computer idling on the want ads online, I realized that I am confused.  What was that thing I was able to do now, what was that thing that my company had given me the chance to do?  I made a list the day this all happen, I made this list based on things I have always wanted to do, like acting, well being famous, writing, creating my own magazine, joining the cast on SNL, and being a photographer.  To me at the time and for the past 20 years this list seemed realistic  and I thought that if I really wanted to I could do all these things, but now they all seem like dreams that will never come true, dreams you have always known will never come true, even on that warm summer night in the park with a group of your friends all sitting around talking, where you declared that one day you would have accomplished one if not all of these things, you still kept that list close to you at all times as a reminder that money isn’t always everything and that happiness is.  But today 10 days later I have no idea what I want to do or what that thing is, and all those good things that would make me happy, seem like something a 26 year old would have starting doing a long time ago, maybe sometime after high school.  So now as I sit here typing this somewhat of a confession, I ask myself, how late is too late?  Or better yet, how old, is too late?

       Papa can you hear me?    I was watching Scrubs earlier tonight, about 3 hours ago, and I realized at the end of the show, while JT did his usual closing monologue, that I really, Really, REALLY like shows that do this.  Even Sex and the City used to do it and I am sure a number of shows that I can't think of right now do it.  I can't really explain why I like this, but I think it has to do with the way they put things that happen in that episode in perspective, they seem to explain how things turned out either better or worse and it just makes you think, well it makes me think.  Also tonight I was toasting an english muffin and I realized that it took 8 minutes to toast and not even toast to a nice shade of brown, I am talking practically raw in the middle.  Why is that?  Tomorrow morning I am making french toast for breakfast, or as you few american's who follow Bush call it "Freedom Toast".  :P  In other news tonight I took an online assessment test, it asked me 125 questions about how I see most people and another 125 about how I see myself, and then finally 50 list of 4 different types of jobs that I had to choose my first choice and second choice, here is a list of the ones I most often picked:   detective writer published author photographer magazine editor reporter magazine writer advertising exc commercial actor, like come who wouldn't pick this singer musician actor radio announcer scout leader camp counselor youth club counselor librarian, well this one was over a politician, welder and scientist social worker   I never got to see the results, cause they are being sent to my career counselor, but really do you think I will really need it in writing when they tell me that for a living I should be planting a garden with troubled youth and writing down all the experiences with said troubled youth so that I can turn said experiences into a song, a song that I will be able to sing while I pretend to put books away in a library while I pose as a librarian, so I can spy on some lady who's husband hired me to be the detective who sees if she is cheating on him.  Like seriously, come on now, does anyone need this in writing?

       Seasons change, feelings no longer exist    When I was a kid, every new season sparked some sort of joy in my life. Each first day of a new season I would jump out of bed, excitingly looking for snow, yellow grass covered with slush and sprinklers at high speed in both the back and front yards.  Each season meant a new beginning a reason to start over fresh, a clean canvas if you will.    With Winter came Christmas, Christmas holidays, Christmas gifts, hot chocolate snow days and snowmen, outdoor skating and my birthday in February which ultimately meant more gifts and chocolate frosted cake with candles and smarties smothering the cake.    With each coming of Spring, my heart would race at the thought of jumping in puddles, raincoats, spring break somewhere warm with my family and later with friends and the Easter bunny who dropped off chocolate eggs at my bedroom door.    Months later summer would roll in, which meant vacations by the lake, no more homework, no more getting out of bed before the 10 o'clock, TONS of swimming, playing hide-and-go-seek till midnight, short shorts, tanks tops, and the fact that you could wear your bathing suit as underwear on a daily basis and no one would say a thing, because back then they too were thinking in the back of their heads, "you never know when you might make a new friend with a pool", so you  always  had to be ready.  Fall, regardless of the end of a summer romance and the starting of another dreaded school year, brought beautiful fall colours, trees losing their leaves, crisp morning air on the walk to school, Thanksgiving and the new fall prime time line up.  And over the next few months winter would come and the cycle of ever changing seasons would begin once again.  This joy, this excitement and this love for the new seasons would carry on with me through high school, where along with the gifts and the swimming and the vacations by the lake, came later curfews, hunky hot boys from out of town, the love for summer fashion and weekends up at a best friends chalet for skiing and snowboarding with yet again hot young boys from out of town.  But as I get older and only 1 week into my 26th year I am realizing that things are changing, much like the seasons, the joy, the excitement, even the sadness that snow storms during Friday evening rush hour could only bring have slowly faded away.  No longer do I long for the summer nights where I would drive around the city, windows down, music blaring whatever song was popular that week and the car filled with friends, the long drive up to my family's summer home on the beach for the weekend with friends, not even this season's fresh new looks for Spring and Summer.  All these things no longer bring a smile to my face on a cold winter's day and they no longer spark a warm feeling throughout my body on snowy winter night, no longer do they hold a special place in my heart.  For now as time has passed and people, like the season have changed, our close knit group that used to countdown the days till we could wear our flip flops again, has gone from 7 to 3 to 2 and I am afraid soon only to one.  We have split up, they have moved on and are no longer in need of this friendship.   Just like I am no longer in need of the changing of the seasons.

       I Heart Glitter    Well it is almost here and people have been making it a big deal already.  Yes you guessed it Valentine's Day.  All over the World Wide Web and all over the streets people have been making a big deal about, with the flowers, the chocolates, the teddy bears (which are the worst) the balloons the cakes and with what would be the most ridiculous part, the singletons in this city (the woman) bitching about not having anyone to share this "special" day with.    Well I am here, a 26 year old woman in a relationship for over 3 years now, that not having someone on this day isn't all i's cracked up to be.  You can share it with your family and friends, with your pets and neighbor's even with your mechanic or bag boys at the grocery stores.  It's day to be happy and to show your love.  Whether it's love for your boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wife, friend, dog or someone who is just nice, go ahead, smile at them and tell them Happy Valentine's Day.  Show them you care or that you have a crush on them.  Happy Valentine's Day everyone!!!!!!!! You too  urlLink  Biz Stone

       For a good time call 555-1255    Have you ever been in a room filled with both strangers and friends and feel like you are alone?  That no one there notices you and that no one there even see's you or cares to acknowledge the fact that they stepped on your $190 shoes?  I have been locked up in a room puking for 3 1/2 days. I know I could have used the word vomiting, but even with the word projectile in front of it it still wouldn't do any justice to the way I have been feeling these past 4 days. I have had the flu or better yet I have been feeling like I was about to die.  Yes die.  I know in the back of my head I was going to be fine once I had puked out a months worth of food, but in that time I swear I saw the light and it was a light vibrant green with a tinge of brown and orange.  It was gross I will stop there.  Needless to say that when I finally showered today after 4 days and put on a pair of jeans they didn't fit me all to well, it seems like I have lost a few pounds and it seems like I have lost a few friends.  Why?  I don't know but I tell you this, if this is what getting older means and if this is what it felt like for you when you were lonely in middle school, well then I feel for ya and it's too bad you had to go through this at such a young age.  Cause now at 26, it hurts like hell, and I can't imagine what it felt like at 8.

       Of all the bars he had to walk into mine.......    Ever since he started dating Demi and hanging out with Diddy, I have lost all respect for him.  But according to  urlLink  Quizilla ,  I am going to marry him.  It must be true, the people at Quizilla know  everything!     You are going to marry Ashton Kutcher. He is kind and sweet, but pulls a lot of pranks (and probably quite a few on you too!!)and can always make you laugh. Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry?

       It's gonna happen and there is nothing I can do to stop it....    I am turning 26 soon.  Too soon if you ask me.   I am too busy to turn 26.  I am too young looking to turn 26.

          In my dream, I am standing in the middle of my room surrounded by cardboard boxes and newspaper clippings from the past 26 years.  I woke-up to realize that the dream wasn't to far from the truth.  Things here are changing, some welcomed others, a pain in the ass.  There are down payments to be made, mortgage papers to fill out, clothes to be ironed, new beginnings to begin, cars to be started and lawns to be mowed.  This may not make any sense to any of you, but to me it means I will no longer have time for this blog, let alone patience to accept it's drab colour scheme.  So in my absence, the pink eraser is in charge.  I will stop in on your blogs from time to time and I will return with something new and something better and something a little more real.  Not here per say, but those who know me will know the new address.  Until we meet again.......  Paris

       I am real bored and it is starting to show.    Nothing really exciting is happening here other than it won't stop raining.  It started sometime last week and it is still raining here  everyday.  I can't even wash my car because it seems pointless to pay for a car wash when the rain will ruin it in seconds.  So it has been a while now that I have been an out of work bum.  I wish it had happen in the summer and not the spring, because at least in the summer I could go out for a walk or a run, or even just drive around with the top down.  I would probably have stories to tell you then, but for now this blog remains boring and lifeless.  I just might delete this site all together.

       ....and Kat had pink hair    She was walking around the office with another 5 or 6 women with pink hair as well.  One of them was holding a sign that said "Vote Yes On Casual Fridays".  They walked over to everyone's desk asking them to sign a petition and once you did they would give you pink hair dye to put in your hair so that when the bosses walked by they saw that you were for casual Fridays.  When they came to my desk I signed with no hesitation at all.  80% was because I LOVE to wear jeans and 20% was because I got to dye my hair pink.  It was right about when someone walked by dressed like a bear and was handed out bagels that I realized that this was only a dream.

       48 hours of Hell    It's a time when you realize that god is made of porcelain.  It is a time when the big shiny bowl is the only best friend you got.  It's a time when the term  "dry heaving" takes on a whole new meaning.  And it is a time when you realize you could never be bulimic.  Yes my friends I am talking about the flu.  I barfed till there was nothing left to be barfed out.  I was MIA for a while and no one knew what the hell happen to me.  People just thought I stopped calling, when in fact it was just a little to hard to pick-up the phone or send you and email when your barfing in 15 minute intervals.  And now that there is nothing left for me offer this porcelain god, I am left with body aches that could cripple any heavyweight and I have such bad shivers that I could star in one of those chocolate milk commercials where they emphasize that you SHAKE THE SHIT OUT of the bottle.  Yes there was a time yesterday that I wished I was dead, and I realized that this was a fate worse then death.   But then things got worse, I thought that there was nothing worse than barfing up yellow stomach/battery acid, but when you see a "For Sale" sign go up on your lawn, the lawn you spent many a years running in barefoot and carefree, well that is when your heart really starts to ache.

       Nothing in Particular   Now that I am home, I don't really have much to post about.  I used to post about how much I hated my job and how I was hoping to find a new one as soon as possible.  Now I just sit here, at my desk at home, and think of clever things to write about.  Today is St. Patrick's Day and Nickelodeon is playing non-stop all day episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants, in honor of the character Patrick who is a starfish.  I am not wearing anything green today because I don't look to hot in green.  So I have opted for jeans and a grey NY t-shirt.  See what I mean, nothing is going on.

       August and Everything After   It is hot, and it is sunny.  The afternoon sun hits the front porch like a million candles burning in a rhythmic pattern, almost hypnotic.  The air smells of humidity and the freeways are filled with motorists wishing they would have opted for the package that had A/C.  The beaches are filled with people sun bathing and playing beach volleyball inches away from the ocean.     I am here, it's 5 degrees outside and I can't wait any longer till this place warms up.   When I was younger I used to wish that me and my family lived in a town that had one of the best beaches to vacation at during the summer break from school.  A town where I could work on the board walk in some small wooden shack and sell French fries and homemade burgers with my best friend.  We would meet almost everyone who walked the on the board walk that stretched out as far as the beach.  At night we would go to the drive inn and watch bad summer horror flicks because my best friends twin brother would work there and he and his friends would let us hang out in the booths with them, watching the movies while we munched on free popcorn and water downed fountain pop.  Our days off would be spent, lying lazily on the beach for hours, soaking up the sun and eating popsicles that we would get free from the younger boy who has had a crush on us since his first day on the job 4 years ago.    The summer would have seemed endless, as the days  would have lasted long past 9pm, and even after the sun had set, we would sit on the beach having bonfires and talking about what we would do come September when we would have to say goodbye to all the out of towners and start school again.     Hearts would be broken and friendships would be lost, and the summer nights would slowly start to end earlier and the town would go back to being it's normal quiet self.  Fall would come and life would go on, and we would take comfort knowing that soon it would be summer time again.  I never got to spend a summer like that.  I never got to do a lot of the things that I believe would have made me a different person and would have me in a different situation today.  Sometimes I wake-up in the morning and wish I lived on my own, so I could lie in bed all day listening to the Counting Crows CD on repeat.   "Round Here"  is starting to have more meaning to me these days.  A lot more then it did back in 1994 when I purchased it.

       The Downside of Unemployment    Did you know that here in Canada books can cost you anywhere from $20 to $55??  And for someone who is not working that is A LOT of money to spend on books, so I couldn't purchase any of your recommendations yesterday.  So here is my new plan;  Is there anyone out there that it willing to sell me their copy of those books for a real low price?  Like say $10.00 CND, which once you receive it in the mail you can change to a bigger chunk of American change?  Please let me know, I will be forever grateful to you!

       Forever pulling the strings of my heart     My heart hurts and my stomach feels like a big empty hole whenever I think of  urlLink  this  .  I can't explain why, but it just does.  I look at pictures and read stories about it and I find myself wishing I was there.  It's like someone a long time ago sent me a postcard from Venice Beach that said "Wish you were here!", and I never forgot those words.  But you see that never happen, no one ever sent me a post card from there.  No one has ever brought me a key chain back from there either.  I have never seen someone's vacation pictures from there, but still for nearly a decade now I have be fascinated with this place and I have no idea how or if I will ever get over this obsession.  Some say if I visit I will get over it, and I think if I visit I might want to stay.  Which wouldn't be a bad thing, just an expensive thing.  Is it that wrong to want to go see a concert at the Hollywood Bowl?  Is it that wrong to want to walk down Sunset Blvd.?  Is it that wrong to want to run into a famous person buying coffee at a Starbucks??  Am I crazy to think that things would be better if I were there right now?  Instead of being here in this cold city, with cold friends and nothing to do all day and night?  I don't think so.   And so what if I think that the grass is greener on the other side, most of you live there, so tell me is it any greener?

       I need your help   When I was younger I used to read a lot, so much that I was at the library about once every two weeks.  I used to read books for young adults, books by R.L. Stine, about all those high school kids who went to parties where someone got murdered and the beach houses in the summer where their best friends brother's ghost now haunted the place.  I used to love these books, I even sometime reread them.  And then one day it stopped probably about the same time I realized that I was getting older and getting to old to read these books.  So I stopped all together.  Now these days with all this time on my hands and nothing challenging to do, I don't want to leave my brain not thinking and processing for too long.  So I am asking for your help.  I have no idea where to begin, so please leave me a comment about what books you think I should read, or better yet recommend I read.  A lot of you who read this know the current state that I am in, I have reached a crossroad in my life with little direction, I want to move on to bigger and better things, but yet I lack motivation, even though Terrence stops by with his ever so greatly appreciated words of wisdom.  So please help me, maybe some of you out there have read some good motivating books, please share.    Oh and by the way, please no self help books, I live in a world where reality comes second to televisions fiction, so keep in mind that I want to see the underlining message for myself, I don't want it to be pointed out in bullet point form or by chapter name.  Thanks a million in advance for your help.  Paris

       Day 15 - Ain't nothing working, ain't nothing right    The title of this blog is becoming more and more a future endeavor as we speak.  I have looked for work now for the last 15 days and there is nothing out there worth applying to.  I am not even sure if I know what I am looking for exactly.  I am at a crossroad, a fork in the road if you will, with what I am to do with my life.   I have a crazy Aunt who is in here late 70's who resides in San Diego, who on a weekly basis calls here to try and convince me to go stay with her for a month.  I know what your all thinking, this would be great my reason to come out to Cali, a reason to come stay there for longer than I can afford cause someone wants me to live with them for a month, but what you don't know is that when I say crazy Aunt, I mean  crazy  Aunt.  Every other week on one of her weekly calls to convince me to come, she forgets which one I am.  She thinks I am married some weeks and other weeks she still thinks I am 5.  So basically what I am trying to say without being mean is that I would have to watch her 24/7, which would mean I would only get to see her condo for a month, and really how much fun could that be.  So this is what I broke this down to;  Life and God have a messed up sense of humor, here is the break down why:  1.  I lose my job to restructuring  2.  I have 4 weeks of severance pay.  3.  I have nothing to do.  4.  I have always wanted to go out to LA for longer than the 3 day trip I could afford.  5.  I have an Aunt with an empty condo in San Diego.  6.  My mom would pay for my flight.  7.  Said Aunt in going crazy and she needs the constant care of a nurse.  8.  I cannot go to LA to stay with her, even though I have nothing better to do.  9.  I am stuck here for the rest of my life.  You see how things never work out for me.  Now you have had a glimpse into my almost-always-these-days-pessimistic-life.  And according to this spell checker I can't even spell.  God help me.

       Lonely Place    It's gloomy here today.  It has been gloomy here for a few days now.  This weather really gets to me and I have no way of controlling that.  When it is sunny, I feel as though I can do anything or be anything I want.  But on days like today, it's hard not to feel like a failure.

       Holiday, celebrate.....   My weekend here was a long one, yesterday was a holiday, Victoria Day, I do believe we were celebrating Queen Victoria's birthday, but don't quote me on that because I never paid attention during history in school and sometimes I really regret it, oh well I digress.  So my weekend really wasn't too action packed, it rained pretty much all 3 days and at times we had tornado watches, yup tornado watches, at one point this weekend we could have been saying "were not in Kansas anymore".  So anyway, I really didn't do much, I watched movies, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", which made me no longer long for a road trip across the US, seeing as there are some really weird folk that live in your back woods.  I also lounged around the house, visited friends and slept in, which I haven't done in a very long time ever since I started school, which by the way is going very well.  I don't want to toot my own horn, but in my first class my final grade was a 98%.  Toot, toot!!  Other than that my weekend was ok, nothing to exciting, but still nice.

       Come on Sunshine   This weekend is a long weekend here.  I am excited and I am not even sure why, I think it may have something to do with leftover "long weekend happiness" feelings from when I hated my job.  Now things are different, but I am still excited.  So today I tried posting a picture on my blog using Picsa and BloggerBot, but I had no such luck.  I am not to sure what my mistake was, I am not sure if I am supposed to download the 15 days free trial of Picsa's software for photos.  All this stuff confuses me more than I need be confused so I stopped trying.  Good times.  So there really is nothing new to tell you.  Things don't really change on a daily basis here anymore like they used to so that is why I don't post everyday, but I will try to.  Since there is no friday five anymore I will post a question here for you guys;   What are you plans this weekend?

       Tell them all I needed this   Things here are heating up, not only weather wise, but summer fun wise....well not really, but I know they will soon.  It's getting warmer and warmer and I am enjoying this whole no working thing, almost too much.  So I've decided that if this whole school thing don't work out I am going to fly to New York and BEG!  I mean  BEGGGGG!!!  the producers and writers of SNL if I could join the cast in the fall, you know cause Jimmy Fallon left.  No seriously if there is anyone out there reading this with an SNL hook-up, please umm....hook me up!  It would be greatly appreciated.  I have always been a HUGE fan of the show and I am not embarrassed to do any of the skits that Tina Fey writes for me.  Also I am perfectly capable of laughing during the skits with the best of them.  I think I may have posted about this in the past, and I apologize for repeating myself, but I really want this to happen.  Fine I had no formal training, but I love to laugh and I love to make people laugh, and ok fine I will admit it, I do sometimes like to be the center of attention.  Anyway enough of this begging and self marketing, it's 2:33am here and I need to get some sleep for school tomorrow.

When will my neighbor's dog learn that it is not nice to bark for an hour straight at 2 am when I have my window open because my bedroom is like a raging fire from below and everyone refuses to put the A/C on?  When Baby Jesus, when?  Paris

       Hot time, summer in the city.......   Wow it is hot here today! I mean I am on FIRE!!!  It was 29 degrees here and with the humidity, it was 33.  I love it, I really do.  It hasn't been this hot since last August and oh how I have missed this weather so much.  It's even nicer now that I am at home and I can enjoy it sitting in my backyard, that's right, backyard.  Other than that I sit in my room doing school work or drive around with the windows down and let the air blow through my hair!  But other than that not much is happening.  I'm not complaining though, I love the way my life is right now, and I think once I am done school and working in a job I love it will be just as great.  I am really trying to enjoy this warm weather cause I have a feeling it won't be this warm in the next couple of weeks.  That's it for now.  Come back soon.  I have a feeling my stories will only get funnier.

       Welcome Back   I am back, from what was a well deserved break.  After I got laid off from work, I went into bitter spiral of negative thoughts.  I wasn't myself and decided that there was no need for the temporary me to be on the internet.  So I sat back, waited out this bumpy ride and now I am back, better than ever.  In the past month and a half a lot has happen.  I won't fill you in on all the boring details, but I will tell you that I am still not working, by choice, but I am actually going back to school to get a degree and finally do something with my life that I want to do.  That was the key element missing all these years, I wasn't doing something I wanted to do, I was doing something I had to do.  But now I am back.  It's really warming up here and I can't wait until it is officially summer.  I plan on sitting in the backyard all summer and getting a nice tan.  Other than that I plan on going swimming, drinking and enjoying my freedom from a 9 to 5 job.  So that is where I have been, maybe some of you have missed me, maybe some of you never noticed, but I am back.

       July 1st   It's a long weekend this weekend and for once it will actually feel like the weekend to me, why? You ask, well that is because I will not be here from Thursday morning till Sunday night.  We are going away for the weekend, a much needed and anticipated break from the city.  I will pack my bags, turn off my computer and cell phone and spend some relaxing, quality time on the beach with a magazine and a good book and some good friends.  I am really excited, I haven't done this since I was 21, wow a whole 5 years.

       Here there and everywhere   I haven't blogged in a while, I think about a week, which is a lot considering I used to blog every weekday and sometimes on the weekend.  I've been kinda busy, but not really.  I've had school work to do and some errands to run, but nothing major.  I just didn't really have anything blog worthy to say.  I mean I can't post everyday about tanning, or reading magazines or watching TV, I will add however that soap operas are really tacky.  My days have been spent lounging outside, going for lunch, taking tests, completing assignments and enjoying the summer off.  Other than that nothing is new.    So for now I leave you with this and I hope something exciting happens this weekend and I can post all about it!

       Summer Rules   For the past, oh I'd say 10 years, I have been following the same rules each summer, and they are fun ones to live buy, so I thought I would share some with you.   1  .  Always wear your swim suit under your clothes because you never know when you will encounter someone with a pool.  (this includes casual Fridays at work)  2.  Once you stop wearing closed shoes with socks, you are to never put on a pair of socks again until the temperature goes below 10 degrees.  3.  You can never be too tanned.  Once you get some colour, get more and more and more.  4.  Never use anything higher than Tropicana Dark Tanning Oil SPF 4 on your legs.  They take forever to get dark.  Always use SPF 15 or higher everywhere else until you no longer burn.  5.  Always have your toes nicely polished.  I don't me get weekly $25- $30 pedicures, do it yourself at home.  6.  Hit the beach whenever you can.  Here in Canada we have 9 months of winter and 3 months of summer.  HIT. THE. BEACH. A LOT.  7.  Flip flops and tank tops are a must.  Enough said.  8.  Bikinis are always fun when you have a  funky print on them.  9.  Always dress like a surfer chick.  You never know who is watching.  10.  Always keep a towel and boardshorts in your trunk.   See Rule #1.     So those are my rules, do you have any?

       Let me clear my throat   There has been a lot of confusion on this website today, so I will straighten things out.  I am not engaged, nor will I be anytime soon.  That would just freak the shit out of me and I would lock myself in my room for days in hopes that it would all just go away.  Yes I am a little weird when it comes to my own engagement, and I am not your typical girl just looking to get married.  Not that anything is wrong with those types of girls, it's just not who I am.

       Me settle down?   Never     For years there has been this type of woman, the "single sister" as I would like to call her, that has been portrayed in the movies as the independent, carefree, always on the go, type that you could call on for anything and they would be there in a minute.  Always showed as the one who would walk into your home, open your fridge and help themselves to whatever they wanted.  They loved your children and your children usually called them their favorite Aunt.  They helped you set up birthday parties hours before it even began because they had no children or "family" of their own to hold them back.  They were the "fun" sister and all of your friends who only had brothers, wished they had one for themselves.   For years I have been this sister.  Actually for 9 1/2 years, 2 nephews and 1 niece I have been this sister.  The one you could call on for anything, at anytime any place, I would be there at the drop of a hat.  In my family I am know as the cool aunt who when you turn 18 will take you to get your first tattoo and keep it a secret from your mom.  I am the cool aunt who will jump into a pool fully clothed to splash as much water in your face.  I am the cool aunt who will take you to McDonald's and let you get the happy meal only for the toy.  I am the cool aunt who will show up at your house with ice cream on a really hot day.  I am the cool aunt who will buy you all those silly toys you put on your wishlist at Christmas time.  But all in all I have been the aunt who will always be single, carefree and independent, and who will one day when your old enough to understand, teach you how to be this way.  But now, 26 1/2 years later, I am the aunt with a brand new joint account who is planning on a long term commitment that is freaking the shit out of her.

        Who's down with G-O-D?    The movie Saved! comes out tonight and I am dying to see it, two reason:   1. Mandy Moore throws what seems to be a bible or some sort of Christian book at a girl while she screams "I am filled with Christ's love!"  2.  The movie look hilarious!    I heard that some people were getting offended by the context and storyline of this movie, seeing as I am Catholic, I don't see how.  Maybe if I was Christian I would understand.  Either way I hope none of you hate me for saying I want to see this movie.  Anyway, it's Friday, it's the weekend and since there is no longer a Friday Five, I decided that maybe I will start my own thing for Fridays.  I decided that on every Friday I will post and audioblog.  Either me talking or playing a song.  I am not 100% sure yet and I would like your feedback.  Let me know and then I will go from there.

       PhotoBlog   I came across Terrence's photo blog the other day and decided that that would be a really good way to display my photos online, but I have no idea how to do that.  Does anyone out there have any idea how to do that?  If you do please let me know!  Thanks!!!

       If my memory worked...   Last night while I was falling asleep I thought of something to post about, and since I was already at the point where thoughts and sounds seemed like a dream, I didn't bother getting up because I thought "hey I will remember this amazing post in the morning!".  But alas here I am and I have no idea what the hell I was going to post about.  No clue what so ever.  I thought that maybe if I signed on to blogger and sat here for about 15 minutes just staring at the interface I would remember that ever so brilliant post, and still my memory has not drugged up any recollection of the post.  So for now I leave you with this.  Chances are that while I am out I will remember so if I do I will audblog it if I can.    Till then, have a nice day!

       This ones for you   In yesterdays post I thank people who helped me come to a decision about going back to school and there was one person that I actually thanked, but did not mention his name because when we spoke about going back to school almost daily on MSN, I thanked him a million times then, but I guess he wanted mention on this site, and who can blame him.  So here you go,   THANKS A MILLION  urlLink  MATT STAHL   FOR YOUR ENDLESS SUPPORT, ADVICE AND FOR LISTENING TO ME WHEN I WAS COMPLETELY LOST AND CONFUSED!  THANKS FOR ALL THOSE COUNTLESS MSN HOURS!!     and I even linked your site just so you would feel extra special!

       He left me on Friday, and ruined my weekend   I finished 2 1/2 courses so far in school and I am still loving it!  I am really eager to hurry up and finish and actually start applying my knowledge.   I was thinking back yesterday on how I was really confused a few months ago, with no direction and no motivation to do anything about it.  I remember posting about it and I also remember a few people out there who gave me some great words of advice.  So now I would like to take the time to thank them.  Jenny, for telling me that I could do and be whatever I wanted, as long as I tried.  Kat who said that having education was always a good thing.  Terrence who told me that it was never to late to go to school, actually he told me a story about a friend of his who was thinking of going to med school and wasn't sure because he when he was done in 4 years he was going to be a 32 year old doctor, and then someone told him that regardless of whether or not he went to school in 4 years he was going to be 32 years old.  Does that make sense?  Or did I butcher the story?  Anyway point being, if it wasn't for those 3 people and a few others here on this end, I would never have given going back to school a second thought.  So THANKS! a million, I really appreciate it.

       Strange but true    I am having a hard time posting these days.  It seems that ever since I stopped working I don't have much to talk about.  How could this be?  I have more time to do things for myself and enjoy this time off but I can't.  I have nothing really to do besides school work, and who really wants to hear about that?  I really don't know what I can tell you.  It's not the greatest weather out here, for about 2 weeks now it has been raining most of the time and it has also been very cool, it's reached a high of 18 degrees, that's it, and it is June now.  I wish I lived by the beach, this I can tell you.  It would be so much easier for me to get a nice tan if I lived by the beach.  Oh yeah and I wish I was a socialite, ya I know pretty shallow but still a wish of mine.  If you think about it all you would have to do is just go out and shop and then go on vacation to all these exotic locations, sparing no expense!  You would be invited to all the best parties, have designers begging you to wear their clothes and you would always be in a magazine!  I wouldn't mind showing up in an issue of Intouch Magazine, with a caption that read  "Blissful Princess Easy Life"  or even  "Paris Loves to Party" , actually I have seen that one but it wasn't about me.  Anyway I am rambling now and it is 4:49pm here so I've got to go find something to watch on t.v.  Yes I know pathetic, I should be saving something or someone but I am too lazy to move.

       Suntan lotion, beach towels, bikinis...these are a few of my favorite things......    Well kids it's that time of year again where I say good-bye to the awful, cruel, fast paced city, and head up to a more relaxed, calming, inspiring destination.&nbsp; I am heading up to my beach house.&nbsp;   I will sit on the beach, take walks on the beach, do cartwheels on the beach, underwater handstands, rock diving, and many other beach related things.&nbsp; It will be the weekend to remember, or so I hope.&nbsp; Part of me wishes I was going with other people, or better yet, alone.&nbsp; But I know that with this certain company I will still have a good time.&nbsp;   Bringing back the summer of '91 this weekend, and loving it!   Hope you all have a great weekend!&nbsp; See you back on Monday, with lots of pictures!!!

         Heroes, Songs, Engines and Grasshoppers     &nbsp;  This past weekend is a bit of a blur, and as much as I would like to tell you that it was from a lot of heavy drinking, it's not, it's actually from doing too much in such a little amount of time.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I saw Spider-man 2 this past weekend, and I have to admit it almost had me in tears, and I say almost because I forced myself to hold the tears back.  &nbsp;  I love the whole idea of superheros and I really wished that they existed in real life.&nbsp; Like tell me you wouldn't think it was cool if there was a bank robbery in progress right in the middle of you signing your mortgage papers and then bang, all of a sudden out of now where come this man in a blue and red, or any two colors for that matter, to save the day.&nbsp; I would love it!&nbsp; And I think I would be in love with said superhero and I think it should really be    urlLink  Tobey Maguire     .  &nbsp;  Then last night we decided to head into the city after a long day of cleaning, shopping and cooking, to see what kind of "crazies" were out.&nbsp; And let me tell you that there was a ton! of crazies out last night.&nbsp; But we had a good time anyway, walking the crowded streets, talking with random "non-crazies", and dancing on the corner of Peter and Richmond.&nbsp; It was great! Until the drive home when my friends car was having engine trouble, which left us stranded on Bloor till 4am when the god damn thing started up again.&nbsp; The rest of the way home we just rubbed the dashboard while praying and saying good things about that piece of shit car.  &nbsp;  This morning we all headed out for breakfast and down to walk along the waterfront and throw rocks in dirty Lake Ontario.&nbsp; Then I came home, went online and realized that I hadn't blogged in a while and that I have a bad habit of doing that.&nbsp; So I decided that when I have nothing to blog about, I am going to post the lyrics that the song I currently have on repeat in my cd player and car.  &nbsp;  And that folks sums up my weekend and pretty much explains the title of this post, well all of it except that grasshopper, which flew into my friends ear today while walking along the waterfront.&nbsp; I was frickin' hilarious, until one threatened to jump into my ear.

       An end to a somewhat era   Since September 4th, 1984, we have owned a summer house near the lake, and ever since that day we have been spent many weekends and weekdays up there on the beach, sun tanning, swimming, relaxing and creating great memories.    The till-this-day never paved road consisted of other summer homes occupied by cousins and now close friends of the family.  Until I was about 14 years old, me and my family and all of our neighbor's up there would spend the last week of July and the first week of August up there all together.  In the morning all the kids, about 15, ages ranging from 10-24, would head out for a walk after breakfast, then go down to the beach from 10am till noon, head back to the house, have lunch, and then head back to the beach from 2pm till 4pm.  We would have swimming competitions, diving competitions, beach volleyball games, and sometimes sun tanning competitions.    At night, once we were all showered and clean, all of us would head to my backyard and have BBQ together.  The kids at one picnic table and the adults at another.  We would laugh about what happened earlier at the beach, or cheer about how the girls bet the boys in the beach volleyball competition.  We would help clean up the dishes and then all 15 of us would head to a nearby arcade.  Some nights we would have a bonfire at one of our houses and talk about our lives back in the city, about what subjects we decided to take next year in high school or what major we decided on in college, and who we were dating back home.  Other nights we would play hide-and-go-seek till midnight, or take long walks to nearby neighborhoods at 11 o'clock at night.  This continued for many years, until of course we all got older, got full-time jobs and decided to get married and have children.  And till this day when we are all up there we talk about those summer nights spent together running away from raccoons, or hiding our hair from low flying bats and thinking that things were never going to change and that no matter what we could always count on seeing each other up there.  Yesterday my sister went up there with her family and called to tell us that just yesterday a for sale sign went up on one of the cottages that belonged to close family friends.  My mom looked up and said "The first of many."  I got up from the dinner table, walked into the bathroom and cried for 25 minutes.

       (Insert your own title for this post here)   I thought today I wouldn't put a title cause I really can't come up with one at the moment, maybe later if I think of one I will post it.  Anyway, it's friday and that means it's the weekend and that means that I have time off from school and it's workload to have some fun.  I seem to be having a hard time thinking of something to do.  This weekend here in the city there is the  urlLink  Molson Indy  , some street party or festival on Yonge Street, and the usual parties at various clubs in the city.  All three things are of no interest to me, well except maybe the street party thing.  But you see Yonge Street is a really really long street  urlLink  (the longest in the world actually)   and I just wouldn't know what part of the street would be having the better party, know what I mean?  So I think I will opt for some needless shopping on Saturday, followed by a BBQ in my backyard, followed by cruising the nearby streets and honking at people going to the Yonge Street Party, then crashing on the couch at about 4am, wake-up on Sunday, get some breakfast and then go down to the Beaches.  Yes I think that it what I will do.  Happy Friday everyone and have a good weekend!

        Summer lovin' had me a blast....    Well I am back, it is 10:50pm and I just walked into the house about an hour ago.  My weekend was really fun and relaxing.  My days as I mentioned before were spent lounging on the beach getting a tan, swimming and playing beach volleyball.  The evenings were spent making BBQ, sitting under the stars around a bonfire and sharing stories from when we were 19 years old.  It was a blast and it was a great getaway that I think we will be doing at the end of the month again.  I really needed this time away from the city and the hectic life that is Toronto living and to do some thinking about the next few steps I need to take to make this future of mine a little bit better and a lot more interesting.  I also realize that today is 4th of July so a Happy Independence Day to all my American friends!!!!!!!!

       God damn wireless internet!   So much for no communication with the outside world.....someone brought a laptop with wireless internet and all I brought was a floating double bed for the water....silly me I thought we were going to the beach and all I needed to bring was some tanning oil, beach towels, a bikini, and the lovely water bed that everyone loves and is using in the water to get a better tan!  But of course I decided to take full advantage of his wireless internet and post and comment on your blogs.....good times good times....my cell phone is still off, that's a good sign....  till I post again...Happy 4th of July to all my American friends this weekend!
