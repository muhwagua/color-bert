      Pointlessness strikes me, after a full week off at half-term I am more than ready to go back to school. In fact I do believe this is a evil capitalist plan to dominate the world through bored school children... But I think that's just me...

      Meh,  pity, mtgnews.com is now closing, it was a really good site for spoilers and stuff, being able to come up with the goods as it were, about a week before the set was actually released.  anyhow, the magic community at school is alive and well, and soon I shall be able to complete my plan of world domin- oh wait, I didn't say that.   Something I don't get though, what is it that makes n00bs think they're top of the world just cuz they're deck no longer loses horribly on turn 4?  well, that's me for today, until next time, may you topdeck like a pr0.

      Meh,  Decided to take a break from the random slagging of Chinese School,  (alright, so I haven't bothered my ass to actually post the dirt yet but be patient) So we had the Easter Concert today... In fact, just got back from it... /me sigh... I really need to get a life...  Anyway... Instead I have decided to start random slagging of the Taiwanese "President"  (people who know me *should* know why I put in quotation marks)  A long long time ago... In a Continent far far away...  A fairly unpopular "president" was trying o get re-elected... His name was Chen Shui Bian  (don't worry if you don't think you can pronounce it, you probably won't ever need to) http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-03/25/content_317890.htm  The day before the election, he was "shot" by an unknown assassin...  Yes.. He was *that* desperate...  Anyway, that's the background story...  The joke is in a Chinese TV show I watch, its a topical discussion show where people randomly talk about current affairs.  Here's a transcript:  Man 1: Strange how after Chen Shui Bian got shot he still strutted about. Man 2: Yeah, wasn't he shot in the stomach? Man 1: yeah, he was shot in the stomach after the bullet went round his back in a circular trajectory *between* his clothes and skin. Man 2: They rushed him to hospital right? Man 1: When he was getting surgery, it looked like he was getting a circumcised Man 2: And the bullet trajectory, it looked as though before it got anywhere near him, it had to go through about 8 people  :D My 2 cents Meh...

      Meh...  Now I seriously Pissed off...  I've had to post this one again cuz of my stupidity... Or rather, my lack of understanding of Blogger... Its a long story, adn i still want to get some CS in before I get kicked off the comp...  Anyway... Long time since I last posted, well, *check blog*  4 days... seems like an eternity... anywho...  here goes  Friday: Not much of note, my plan of ripping of second years in trades suffered a major setback as i realised Yao had already taken everything that was worth anything off them. for that matter, this isn't a major setback, more like a fatal one... :/  Saturday: Saturday we had the Chess thingy... we came second and Sullivan won... surprise surprise...  Only real thing that is worth mentioning is that Simon lost in like 10 moves to a crappy guy from St Malachy's  Sunday: *rubs hands in glee* Oh ho ho, don't get me started on Sunday, *realises* oh wait I already have got myself started on Sunday... in fact I think I'll devote a *drum roll* WHOLE post on Sunday, *listens to sound of one hand clapping*  Bleh...

      /me sigh  Heh...  Almost everybody in the class went to the School's cup match and it ended up as 6 people left in the class...  The stupid thing is we ended up playing Monopoly in maths...  If I learned one thing today, it is that corruption is funny....  And definately profitable :D  and I'll bet this will come back to haunt me when I'm older  Meh...

      Hmm... I was in the City Centre today after school, and went round to play some Magic only to find Johnny has gone and closed for St Patrick's Day...  Decided that there was no point so I wandered around a bit and realised that in truth, there was absolutely nothing to do...   So I went back to the bus stop and decided to take a round trip around the City Hall. Major bad idea as while I was a-wandering a huge...mmm... make that *HUGE*.... crowd built up waiting for the concert... I decided to go throught the crowd since it didn't look like it was going to be that hard, but I made one mistake in that I left out the fact that I had a large school bag to carry as well.  Uh oh...  After about 15 minutes of "excuse me", "thanks", "could I get across please", I finally made it through...  Phew...  That is one thing I'm not trying again...  Of course the ground was a complete mess...  Crisp Packets Straws Bottles It was sticky too...  hmm I think I'll stick in a Philip joke now... but I don't think he reads this so I won't bother or maybe...

Bit my tongue really badly and it still hurts when I talk/eat/move tongue  Meh, Clarinet teacher gonna kill me when she sees the state of my scales :/  Ah the joys of topics which aren't related in any way... ^^;;  Should really go practise but can't be bothered...

      Meh,  There's a huge questionnaire thingy going round my friends, strangely enough if you hand us a questionnaire on paper we'd all either go "okay...." Or in Jamie's case "**** off" but of course stick it on e-mail and its the best thing since sliced bread...  Yeah, I know, I need a life...  Anyway, I got Hell Week in 10 days  Thursday - Maths Challenge Friday - Rest Saturday - Chess Tournament  Sunday - Concert Monday - Music lesson at 6:30 Tuesday - Music exam Wednesday - Easter concert rehearsal Thursday - Easter Concert  :/ *sigh*

I just come upstairs from about 10 minutes of "don't do this don't do that do this do that, oh by the way, we give you the freedom you want so don't complain..." It takes quite alot of self control to stop my self from screaming FUCK OFF, :/ what can you do... bah now to do something creative  oh and by the way go read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, have been spending about 6 hours reading it now and eyes are getting sore...  :P

       The week of Hell , folks, the week of hell. Ok, i got orals, english 700 word essay, this, that Duke of Ed, and other crap. And then I have to revise for the f*%$ing exams. F#£k them. At least my website is up at  urlLink dragontail.tk . It needs some updating, but i cant do that till the exams are over. Yaaaay. At least we can have a few LAN parties after the exams though. Some CS and generals/ RA2 would soothe the mind... and I can 0wn! >:D muwahha-*cough* ahem. Anyway, James said he would kick me off if i didnt post :( ain't my fault :( Bad times, people, till next time,   Jamie  ----------------------------------------  feel like punching the wall?

      Bleh,  I suppose I should be thankful for the better computers in school, but not being able to go  anywhere  is a major disadvantage... Hotmail's banned, mtgnews.com is banned, bob, your uncle is banned... sometimes it makes you wonder whether or not we  are  moving towards ONESTATE... If you don't know what that is, well, go listen to it...  urlLink BBC website  Scroll down the page and you'll find "We" read the description and then click on Saturday Edition to listen...  I wonder if Orwell is pleased he's being semi-plagiarised, hmm not even too sure that's a word... >  Meh...

      Bleh... I'm back.. mostly because I couldn't get the other two stooges to post... yeah, If you're confused by the last post I shall free you from your tormented mind...  I tried to get dragontail to stop swearing, which resulted in this particular conversation  Me: Try to cut the swearing down, its like 50% of it is swearing Dragontail: No there isn't, there's only 3 words, so the post would have to be about 6 words long. Me: It is 6 words long... Well it  is  now... Dragontail: WTF?  Yes... its another story of me abusing my power.... Ah the joys of a dictatorship... Bleh... :/

      [EDIT - and here's the rest of the post :P - Jim]   Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm . You know what? I can tell you something. Three words plus some dots (I do recall someone else who uses dots a lot :|):    STEAM SUCKS... BADLY   Yes, all 1.6GB of it. Funny the way it takes up more RAM than the Windows kernel itself. Also, weapons are "reversed", so any old 1.5 models you wanted to converted either has to be mirrored (have to use Milkshape which i can;t be bothered) or the models appear on the left hand although it says clearly in the options menu:   weapons: right handed  >:(  Also due to the fact none of the hosting options work, or/and STEAM has generated 29 error reports in 2 hours of playing >:((

      Meh...  Was working on a bit of VB this morning... thought came to me after the 800th time my quadratics program gave me a error... I assume you all have probably seen The Matrix Revolutions... yes.. If you haven't there's nothing you desperately need to go see either... But anyway,   *SPOILER WARNING* - although slightly late and pointless  but if my small and crap program is about 50 lines of code, and all it does is calculate the answer to a quadratic equation, and remember this is in a high level language, not something like binary :/  how much would the oracle take to write???  ...  Go figure...  Bleh :/

      Having had the fortune to "stay" in china... The first thing to strike is...Jet lag... but as soon as one goes onto the roads... The traffic is the next thing....  having stepped off a plane with less than no sleep in 24 hours I was confronted by a very seedy looking woman taxi driver in a leather jacket looking like she was about to offer me drugs... Crack anyone?  now to full rant mode... I was nearly been run over more times in a span of a week than I have been in 15 years... and here you can get run over by all kinda of traffic in the average city... taxis... vans... the common lorry and the occasional 16 wheeler... oh yeah and bicycles and the often seen bike with a cart stuck to the back and three wheels in total....  to negotiate the average road.... well.... the average road is about 3 lanes either side with a lane for bikes and other bipedal vehicles and people.... did I mention a lot of people?  anyways... understandably the cross road is very large... understand that pedestrian lights are rare... the chances of finding one when you need it is like ... uh... something very rare happening...  the best one can do is find the interval between one light and the next and run... hoping the cars perpendicular to the road you are crossing do not decide to turn....  drivers are also very fond of their horns... I mean very.... they can't get enough of it... bus drivers and some taxi drivers have it worst... its like a disease... thou must  spread the good word by a deafening blast of the horn... if the car/bike/lorry/person/monkeyonashetlandpony doesn't move.... repeat... perseverance always pays off....  I have already had complaints about this post being the equal to the length of war and peace... but I promise.... no russians...  but I regress... tis the end of post 1/10... be happy that pinky decided to grant me post position in the blog :)... He may yet regret it  p.s... no proof reading  [Edit: Did the spell checking etc... God I feel like I'm a forum moderator or something :/ - Jim]

      Meh, Haven't posted for quite a while, and got kinda bored with randomly slagging people.  I do have quite a good quote for you though, its from the Forbes magazine, about GPS.  (I hope I won't get sued for this :/ )  Global Positioning Satellites are so cool that they reinforce one's belief in God. If one chip can communicate with 3 satellites that are orbiting the earth to tell you where - within 18 inches - your teenage daughter is and how fast - within a tenth of a foot per hour - her boyfriend is coming on to her, then all this stuff about sparrows falling out of trees and God in heaven being aware of it is probably true. Certainly its technically possible. My idea of a killer franchise is a drive-through that staple-guns GPS chips into your toddlers, teenagers, aging parents, household pets, and car keys.  rotfl  Bleh ^^;;

      Bleh... Alright... I'll admit it... I'm actually revising...:/ I can't be bothered to write much... ah bugger it... I got a bike today.. and while my dad was paying for it...the woman at the counter asked... would you like to become a member of our clubcard? You'll get a five pound off voucher since you spent more than 50 pounds...  My dad obviously agreed, and I, expecting a form to fill out, walk away... 10 minutes later I return, thinking that it should be over by now... and lo and behold, "Uh... how long have you been employed?", "What do you work as?" the form they were filling in looked like something you'd get from the Home Office... along with a booklet telling you how to fill it out :/  Meh...

Blogger has gone and changed its... well... its everything... I personally think the new graphics are swet, but then again, people don't particularly like change.. so you never know whst the response is gonna be..  a random link for the day:  urlLink Inktank.com  Barry's doing a pretty good job... go check it out :D  Meh

      A huge input into the blog. Well perhaps not. buy anyway. Better note down everything before it runs out of my mind. quote from simon:  Today was quite boring, had to listen/watch Jamie swearing for an hour as we couldn't get the game to work...   exuse me simon, mr smarty ass, i didnt swear a lot, same as you...  Check this out... the first word of every post from James:   Ah, after, meh, pointlessness, grrr, /megroans, ..., meh, w00t, hmmm, meh, ow, hmm, /mesign, meh, meh, meh, meh, just, meh, bleh, meh, meh, bleh, meh, meh, bleh, meh, bleh, bleh...   no offence to James, but see a pattern there?

      great. I just heard from James that he *might* be getting a Radeon X800XT, a real monster when it comes to graphics cards. I'll just have to sit there going "awww" while he points and laughs. great! :( Damn them ceapo canadian currency. I wish I could buy a Geforce 6800 Ultra to get back my revenge, but it is around £400 out my reach at the moment, so I think that will be no, somehow.  Just discovered the profile thingy. I entered my birthday correctly, but it says my star sign is virgo, while my true star sign is libra. "Erm, blogger, sort it out!" I thought. Then as i thought about it, i realised something.  The date is month/day/year across the pond, not day/month/year over here . I changed it, and it came up with Libra correctly. tsk, trust them americans!  The new colour scheme is waaay better, if anyone else agrees. But no one probably reads this so oh well :/ Apparently, Simon might start blogging. This could let onto a big blog if simon bothers his ass and posts regularly...  tribute to l33tn3ss  Jamie

I went and changed the format... I was  that  bored... Cousin is starting to send me up the wall... and I will upload cute and cuddly pictures of the brat as soon as I get this uploading thing working... which could be sometime with this 56k connection... bah...

      Sorry James for the lack of postin'. Yeah. Time to catch up. Just worked another shift today. Must update you on the more interesting side of work:  There are many customers who buy stuff from the place (obviously). I have divided them into groups:   [a] The T-Rexes -  They only buy meat. Meat. More Meta and M - E - A - T. Meaty meat. Big chunks, small chunks, oh and fish! But thats still meat, right? So Meat and fish. Cold meat, frozen meat, seafood, shrimps, fish, lobsters, big flat flatfish the size of a tennis racket... [you get the picture, okay?!]   [b] The Vegans -  I' not gonna go very far. These people buy VEGS! Thats it. No cans, no meat, no nothing but vegs and fruit. Like, eat some meat will ya?   [c] The Can Lovers  - usually crazy looking bastards who looooooooooooove cans. Like, their whole shopping composes of, guess what... cans. Canned fish, canned vegs, Cans made out of tofu, canned stick insects, canned cans, canned flaming dead black sheep, fried cans, broken flying cans that serve soup and loooks for terrorists, but nothing else. The last 6 I mentioned were not true, but you get the picture. ¬_¬   [d] The crazy son of a b%&#hes who buys the entire shop -  No explaination. Just bad luck for thr people who have to pack bags. That would be me *cough* >:(   [e] The utter dumbass  - Okay, I've seen one of those. This black woman orders some chicken legs, a bag of them. She walks around the shop while they are being delivered. The chicken legs are then put into a trolley by a guy. He then leds the woman back to the trolley telling her,  Theres the legs madam."  The man walks away.  The woman looks into the trolley  and says,  "Whos shopping is this? Anyway, wheres my chicken legs?"  ROFLMAO!!!!1!1  Sorry, I don't get much excitement in work. Yes, I know. Its not funny. But believe me, after working 4 or 5 hours non stop, anything is funny.  Except more work. Yeah.  ...  I'mprobably ordering a new mp3 player very soon. Probably next Monday. Its going to a the Monolith II 7010 512Mb Black Aluminium version. Plus some Sennhieser MX 500 Stero earphones, if I can affored 'em. They are expensive at £20, but apparently their sound quality is dead on explosive. Sounds like the earphones fore me :D The only bad thing about the mp3 player is that it doesn't support OGG Vorbis encoding. Arrrrrrghh, I'm not stuck with MP3 am I??! OGG vorbis (or is it vobis? I can't remember) is faaaaar better than MP3. It's smaller than a MP3 song yet sounds better.  urlLink www.monolith-europe.com  has some pics of the black monolith player. Pretty neat, no?  In all due respect James, here ya go. A nice long post. Now off to Ghosanomics for some updates. well after dinner actaully. I need some refuelling before I can function properly again. You have no idea how much energy 9 hours of work needs.    Tribute to thy ROFLMAOCOPTERness, (yes, I know its rofocopter, :/)    Jamie

       Bleh...      I'm going to America tomorrow,       Which means I'll have to get up at 6 so I can get on a coach for 10 hours...      :(      But I won't be posting till I get back, so be patient, (like you want to read the crap I write :P)      Anyway, there's always the miniscule possibility that the other two stooges will actually post...      (Jamie, Don't complain about it being a one man show if you aren't going to contribute, ditto to Simon)      Emma, hope you have a nice flight back...      (even if it's just so I won't have to make a bad airplane joke)      And I shall see you all on Wednesday, when I will no longer be cut off from civilisation...      Damn that felt like I was writing my will or something :/      Meh...

       Bleh...   Cousin got a set of one of those "My First Set of Culinary Tools" thingies, but I would like to point out that it might be better named "My First Set of Lethal Weaponry" or something to that effect,   First of all there was the rolling pin...   It  looked  like one of the flimsy plastic ones that the toy makers use thermoplastics to make, light, cheap, absurdly colourful, probably melts on hot days, debates on its non toxicity still raging... You know the sort of thing...   Well, it hurts when you're getting hit across the head with one...    repeatedly    Don't tell me anything " You're bigger, fend her off" etc etc,   YOU TRY IT WHEN SHE'S SITTING ON YOUR SHOULDERS   You drop her, you die, not to mention that I'm in no particular hurry to get a guilty conscience, I've lasted 15 years without one, I'd like to keep it that way...   You don't, you get beaten to death...   :/    Then there were the biscuit outline thingies, the ones you use to cut shapes out of dough...   Well these were metal...    and pretty frickin' sharp    And of course, I'm currently covered in outlines of goldfish, whales, butterflies...   Did I mention she bit me?   Getting her off the high chair, as usual, then suddenly    *crunch*    She bit through my t-shirt, leaving a little red semi-circle of teeth marks on my shoulder...   I suppose that's my punishment for letting her watch Kill Bill with me...   Argh... Need more Oreos...   Meh...

       Bleh...     &nbsp;   Went to do a bit of shopping today, (or possibly more accurately, got dragged to the mall, per Mother's orders for Aunt to get me clothes...)     &nbsp;   During my wanderings I came across a pet shop...     &nbsp;   Before I continue I must stress that I wouldn't count myself as a Radical Animal Rights Activist,     &nbsp;   For that matter I wouldn't call myself a pet lover...Or even Pet Owner &nbsp; ( ever)    &nbsp;   but still, it was quite disturbing seeing the dogs in 1m by 1m by 1m perspex boxes...     &nbsp;   There were 2 or 3 dogs in each box, and it was a row of boxes, with another row directly on top...     &nbsp;   Wire lined the bottom of each box, presumably air holes have been drilled somewhere...     &nbsp;   and it was  filthy      &nbsp;   Some of the puppys were rolling in their own excrement, others were busy licking the behinds of their compatriots...     &nbsp;   A young girl pointed her finger at one puppy, who immediately started to lick the spot where her finger was pressed against the glass...     &nbsp;   This continued, even long after the girl had left...     &nbsp;   Two guys walked past,     &nbsp;    Ha! look at that fucked up dog!     &nbsp;   Strange how animal rights activists never got on the case of pet shops...     &nbsp;   :/     &nbsp;   Until next time:     &nbsp;   God doesn't protect fools or young children...     &nbsp;   No, He leaves that for Persons with a charitable mentality and Parents...     &nbsp;   Thank NEEITS (that's Non Existing Entity In The Sky, "Thank You" to Claire for that term ^^;;) I'm neither...     &nbsp;   Meh...

       Bleh...     &nbsp;   Back from a day of wandering, and meandering...     &nbsp;   Cousin got a new car seat, and decided not to like it.     &nbsp;   So she cried...     &nbsp;   and cried...     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   and cried...     &nbsp;   She cried until her crying could probably be used as a frickin carrier wave    for UHF signals...     &nbsp;   *sigh*     &nbsp;   Twas  not  a good day for my ears...     I  did &nbsp;find out the extent of Uncles driving skills though,&nbsp;    &nbsp;  It was actually quite comforting...    &nbsp;  Well "comforting" meaning     &nbsp;  "I-know-when-we-hit-something-at-this-speed-I-won't-feel-a-thing..."    &nbsp;  Go figure...    &nbsp;   Hmm tired, going to go sleep now...     &nbsp;   Miss Emma... :(     &nbsp;   Meh...

        Bleh...&nbsp;   A visit to Niagara Falls today, and about 150m into American Territory before deciding it was to much effort and giving up...  &nbsp;  Pictures will be up...  &nbsp;   eventually   &nbsp;  Since I won't be home till the 21st of August...  &nbsp;  Only... 26 days left...  &nbsp;  :/  &nbsp;  On to other news...  &nbsp;  My assessment of Uncle's driving has been changed,  &nbsp;  He's  suicidal ...  &nbsp;  He went and tried to take on a 16 wheeler lorry...  &nbsp;  No, seriously...  &nbsp;  Its a 3 lane motorway, we're in the&nbsp;lane at the very left, the lorry was  at the one on the right...  &nbsp;  And we both wanted to change to the centre...  &nbsp;  At one point I could see the ring on the lorry driver's extended middle finger...  &nbsp;  :/  &nbsp;  And yes, all of this at about 80 miles an hour...  &nbsp;  The other thing I learned today was   never   trust a female with navigation...  &nbsp;  Yes, I'm well aware of how stereotypical/sexist/chauvinistic that comment seems and I apologise, but hear me out first...  &nbsp;  To get back to Toronto&nbsp;from Niagara Falls we had to get back on the&nbsp;motorway, we had no idea how and decided to look at the map, that yielded&nbsp;no clues either, so we drove along until we saw a sign that pointed us in the right direction, so we followed it along, and sure enough there was a junction to turn right ahead&nbsp;to lead us up onto the motorway.  &nbsp;  While the driving was going on&nbsp;Aunt was looking quizzically at the map, and as the turn came she suddenly told us we were going to the wrong way, and she'd explain, but we definitely shouldn't turn right... So we listened to her (as she was rather hysterical at this stage and was complaining about how we didn't listen) and turned left, doing a rather large circuit of the neighbourhood.  &nbsp;  We were completely confused by her explanation and decided to ask a police officer...&nbsp;   "Get back to Toronto? Sure, just follow that road until you get to the junction, then&nbsp;turn right, it'll lead you straight&nbsp;onto the&nbsp;Expressway"   If anyone wants to prove me wrong on this point, feel free...  &nbsp;  Meh...

      Got off my ass to go to the cinema today. First time in 3 months!!! Went to see Spiderman 2, decent, but nothing special.  Parents just don't get it. You don't want to tell them the whole story of the film and how the whole thing went when you want them to pick you up from standing in the bloody rain.  Also, a note to Emma, after discussion and deliberation, I have decided to laugh off your death threat as something done when somebody is greatly deprived of something. Haha  Simon - Look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone (Jet)

      Bleh...   Mission Accomplished, with minimal tears :)&nbsp;   well the prawn crackers helped...   A lot...   And it was all going well...   Until the real sticking point came...   Trying to get her to sleep, sans aunt...   I sorta went "Isn't it your bed time now?"   And before I even got to "time" her eyes had filled with tears...   I had to&nbsp;talk nicely for about 10 minutes for her&nbsp;to calm down...   Yes... contrary to popular belief, it IS possible for me to be nice...   Thankfully, Aunt and Uncle arrived back, taking the whole thing off my hands,   That's one of the few times I get to say "whole thing" as opposed to "whole mess"   :D   Hmm   It appears I&nbsp;will be on a road trip this weekend, so I probably won't post,   Then again, Uncle might get another of his emergency meetings :/   I've been told that Uncle is a mad driver...   It'll be interesting to compare him with my mum, who currently holds my record for most death defying traffic stunt...   That's another story for another day...&nbsp;  Meh...

       Bleh...    &nbsp;  Have been relegated to Babysitting duties, Cousin is currently sitting in the corner happily blowing bubbles, well, to be more exact, happily  trying  to blow bubbles...    &nbsp;  I can think of 2 reasons why small children enjoy blowing bubbles,     &nbsp;    The fact that they are bubbles, spherical and shiny, bursts when you touch them etc...    The child is just happy because of a oxygen high, resulting from the hyper ventilation involved when they are trying to blow the bubbles.     bah, better get back before she does a rendition of "Baby's Day Out" :/    Meh...

      OK, a few points to sort out  1) Jamie, I feel your pain. OK, not really, but it seemed like a nice thing to say. Also, I'm sorry for stealing your signatures, I'll do different random song lyrics instead.  2) Does anyone know what our DoE projects are on? She didn't exactly inform us well!  3) James, "She's 2!" is a perfectly good excuse, in the same way blondes can go "I'm blonde!" and get away with bloody murder. Oh and have you read the prequel to "The Da Vinci Code"? You should, it's a good book.  4) I don't look 16 really, do I Jamie? I'm not going to lie on a job application form, and I don't have, as Conor put it, "the Asians" to help me by not caring. Thought about that, eh Jamie?  That seems to be my random rage over. Not gonna be here tomorrow afternoon, so don't get mad if no post (alright James?)  Simon - If you tolerate this your children will be next (Manic Street Preachers)

       Bleh...   Still not an awful lot happening, point though Jamie, I'd  rather  be at home... :/   That's what boredom does to you...   I have no idea what to do for my project, but I'll figure out something I suppose, I'll have about a week to do it when I get back, along with my Tech... :/   Its going to be a busy week...   On to other things..    &nbsp;  Another fact about the cousin I have noticed is her aversion to hair...   Yep...  hair    No problem if its on your head, but if you get hair in say the bath tub, she'll start screaming as soon as she sees it...    &nbsp;  I beginning to wonder if "She's 2!" is actually still a usable excuse...    &nbsp;  Meh...

      Must remind you guys about the Duke of ed project, otherwise, we might&nbsp;f#£$ed. Unfortunately, James doesnt have CS to keep him interested.&nbsp;unlucky. Point bout your complaining bout boredom:  Hello guys ! You both have been/still are&nbsp;in some other place par from&nbsp;your freaking bedroom/this country, unlike me who will also have to move to the computer room as my mum&nbsp;attacks my room with paint, hammers and various other letal equiptment, having my stuff&nbsp;burnt in the process, how would you like that. (Now I wait James to&nbsp;come up with some smarty-ass reply like he always does, dont even try it this time, I expect Simon to say: "Hahahahahahaha you suck, I dont give a s*%t, if you caught fire&nbsp;I would come around and pour kerosene on it to make it burn some more, etc, you are un - leet, blahdy blah etc etc etc) Whatever  Hmm, i see that Simon's trying to turn my signiture against me, enough of this nonsense. Simon sig is: Tribute to jamiesunl33tnessdoesntgetasmuchmoneyasconor, which&nbsp;means that although me and Conor both work, Conor gets paid an extra 20p/hour more than I do. I believe than I actaully  earn  money. Tell me again, how much do you earn? Since Simon is more of the mathematical type, hers a little equation for you to work out the answer to the above question:  Y(0)U   x   34(r)\&nbsp; +  f(_)((C))  -   41_1_   x   s(*0*)   -   $7f\_/!!   =   Simon is totally unl33t  lol :P, only j/king    Tribute to&nbsp;thy openmindedness    Jamie

      Meh...  I do pity you James, but at least you only have another month of it to go. I have to live with my little sister for at least another 4 years, on top of the 13 I've already endured.  Grrrrrrrrrrrr  Anyway, I've got very, very bored within 2 or 3 days of being home. Have been doing esceptionally random things like watching daytime TV and putting golf balls up and down the floor of my bedroom (I don't play golf).

(I can see it now in the comments, just about everyone I know going, "Only at times?")    &nbsp;  If Jamie can't sort it out then we'll either have to leave it and hope it fixes itself, or maybe change it permanently...    &nbsp;  Missing Emma :/    &nbsp;  Meh...

       Bleh...  &nbsp;  It was just another day until:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;      Come on baby, lets go party     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That was disturbing, more so in the fact that my 2 year old cousin had just uttered them...  &nbsp;  So, to ease myself, I sat and watched Gladiator with her on my lap...  &nbsp;  There are those of you who might take this as a warning to keep me away from small children...  &nbsp;  And you may be right...&nbsp;       In&nbsp;other news, I'm told the trip to Niagra&nbsp;Falls will have to be delayed as Uncle will be in a meeting of some kind...    I suppose that will give me more time to do some Flash...     I doubt it, my aunt will have planned something...    *sigh*    She's downloaded these fairytale stories in Mandarin... Cinderella etc...    And is playing them for the Cousin...    And so obviously I'm the only one who pays any attention, (try that for bored to death...)    I swear, the people who are reading them also do the propaganda films...    After my 6th time of Listening to Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling, I have two question...     Why is  the Ugly Duckling  called that? Wouldn't  the supposed "duckling" which was actually an cygnet , or something along those lines be more, well, accurate? I don't mind if you don't agree with me, it  is  a rather moot point...    Secondly, in  Cinderella , the two step-sisters cut off a toe and a heel (respectively) to fit their feet into the silver shoes, afterwards, the narrator said, and this a translation from Mandarin by me, so I can almost guarantee accuracy (Isn't modesty a wonderful thing?)     "The sisters were so angry at their step-sister that their faces turned white"    That was after the prince's "you're my princess" etc etc  Correct me if I'm wrong, but If you've had your big toe, or heel, cut off, the last thing you'd get a rather white face for would be from anger... Let's see... the pain, or perhaps more likely, the  agony , the blood loss... I just can't see anger being worse than those two... especially combined... But then again... what do I know? :/     I know... I like to argue moot points, that are completely pointless (no pun intended)    Meh...

I'm gonna punch you in the face until you bleed to death   And, yes, that was neither here nor there...     &nbsp;   Hmm, I wonder if watching Kill Bill will have a detrimental effect on my cousin... she sort of sat through the first half hour with a sort of rapturous awe...     &nbsp;   In a bad movie&nbsp;I shall find this to my disadvantage some day when I'm assailed by a murderous 6 year-old brandishing a large cleaver :/      But I doubt it somehow...        &nbsp;    hopefully...        &nbsp;    Meh...

       Before...   kinda bored right now >:/ Gonna cycle around the place for a while. See if i can get the m00k3s to run after me :) then they probably thow rocks at me >:| Nah, better not. I'll just cycle to the park... nah, prob full of mo- how about the corner shop - nah, prob full of- erm, the lake? prob full o- eerm, erm, the local roundabout? prob ful- AGH why the hell are the annoying bas***ds running the area?!  Anyway, did some more on the flash. Go to my other blog to see a small gif anim :)  Too bad, I'll leave this half typed and go outside anyway.   After...   Back - just went to the park, only a wee m00k3 there, better than I thought. Sorta cycled in loops, got bored and tried some wheelies and some other crap and *nearly* fell off. [note to self - do not try a BMX biker for a career] Then i hit the curb at high speed and fell off. I was like " holy ****! ", but lucky landed okay on the grass, as I twisted around with my n1nja speed and skillz (correction: uber lucky to land not too badly, although on my knees which dont look too healthy, being wrecked and bloody). Grr, must not wear shorts when cycling next time :/ My left hand is sore cos it smacked off a tree quite fast. Whos the stupid retard who planted it there anyways? Overall, a good trip nonetheless, the pain flows, but it does some good >:)    Tribute to thy retardedbastardwhoplantedthytreeness,  Jamie

      Bleh...  Am sitting here listening to some random fairytale for the cousin's benefit...:/  But judging by the fact that she's happily dumping rubbish onto the ground, I don't think she's listening...  It's quite strange, its an amalgamation of Snow White and Goldilocks... with some overenthusiastic dwarves...  Now to wait for her to go to sleep so I can watch Kill Bill, or maybe The Mummy Returns... I shall see...  *atchoo*  Meh...

      Bleh...  Bah.. Not an awful lot happening, the fire alarm went off as my aunt was cooking, resulting in the cousin doing a world class screaming baby impression...  It also appears I must actually do some work for Jamie for once as opposed to sitting on my backside doing nothing as normal... *sigh* ah well... Brainstorming for ideas time...  BTW nice flash Jamie, although it looks quite similar to your original, but hey... I can't say much... :/  Meh...

Correct me if I'm wrong. overall exellent post. *laughs*  Anyways, seems like I'm getting a 6800 GT muwhahaha. I also done 31 secs of some Flash. Without any resources. Some dudes fighting with axes, throwing knifes and kantanas. Have a look at  urlLink this .   [EDIT]   Got some screenshots now in  urlLink my ghostanomics blog . If you cant see the latest post titled "here ya go" then click archives for 7/04 on the side to see them.     Tribute to thy laughinatsimonnonstopness,  Jamie

      Bleh...  Boredom resumes...  Congrats to Jamie for getting off his ass to do some work... I would, but (excuses time...) I'm in Canada...  I have managed to catch a cold while the outside temperature is 27 degrees, I will now procede to blame the cousin considering she's been coughing for the past 3 days... >:(  damn her...

      Got a job at the Asian Supermarket. Have to work 9 hours a day at £3 an hour. Its the basics, such as packaging, bagging, etc etc. 9 hours seems to take 12 hours. Time slows down in the building just to piss me off. I was so bored and tired that I made a comp to see who had thew biggest orders (i baggage the food into guess what plastic bags). Its kinda joint at the top :)   At number 3...  A fat guy walks into the shop. Real fat. He was six times the width of me, and a lot more times heavier. I swear, i felt the ground shake when he walked past. His order?  £450 of packaged burgers, hot dogs, meat, and coke and fanta . It was delivered from the warehouse in boxes, so i luckily didnt have to package it. Funny thing was, the guy couldnt get in/out threw the normal door, so he had to go in/out through the warehouse doors X-D   At number 2...  A woman takes 2 trolley worths of food plus a mass order from the warehouse. I was like holy fuck! I was busily for 5 minutes packaging her stuff and then her husband comes through with another trolley worth. :'( Total order?  £790  It must have been their shopping for the year or something.   At number 1...  A man comes on Wednesday with a £450+ order of food. Not that big. He then comes on Saturday with another £450+ order. £ 900+ worth of food in four days ? I'll use a James qoute: " Go figure :/ "  At least i'm getting paid for this. At the end of 8 weeks I will have around £400 for working 2 days a week. Enough for a Nice Gryffin or Dita hockey stick and a iPod maybe?  Its all fun I tell yer >    Tribute to thy baggagingness,  Dragontail

      Bleh...  I'm bored again...   There's only so many science fiction novels you can read before you find them tedious and pointless, I'm going for about 30, but I suppose people can start with 0 if they like...  That's life for you...  I'll leave you with this:  Why is it that when you are obsessed about getting sunshine out of oranges you are "crazy" and when you're obsessed about a person you are "in love"? :/  Go Figure...  Meh...

      Bleh...  In an effort to alleviate my boredom, I obtained a copy of John Wydham's  The Day of The Triffids  as well as about 10 other Science Fiction books, they  should  keep me occupied for the week, but after going through 3 in 36 hours I'm beginning to have doubts...  Anyway, if you should ever be in need of a good book, especially if its Science Fiction (note I didn't use Sci-Fi *shudders* evil term...) then Wydham will not disappoint...  As for The Day of The Triffids, here's a basic synopsis:  The main protagonist, Bill Masen wakes up on Wednesday 8th of May to find the hospital he's in deathly quiet, so he decides to take off the bandages around his eyes himself. The night before everyone in the world had gone out to witness a brilliant meteor shower display, but the green light had a strange effect on the eyes, the population had been blinded... If this wasn't enough, the mysterious plants known as triffids had flourished in the lack of human intervention, before, the strange carnivorous plants with the ability to move were just curiosities... now they were overrunning the country feasting on the vulnerable populace...  It's a rather disturbing book, more so in that it feels like it could be true...  and yes... I now have a phobia of shooting stars and green plants :P  Meh...

      Meh...  I was quite surprised to discover I was growing a beard...   wait... make that I was quite in pain this morning after the cousin decided to pull on it...so its considerably more sparse than it was,   well, saves me shaving I suppose :/  The boredom is starting to get to me now... well, more precisely, its starting to get to me in between the bits where the cousin attacks me or starts screaming...  Yes, I know... I whine too much...  bah... >  Bleh...

I went to High Park today... Its kinda like Central Park... except its not in New York... afterwards we went to China Town in Toronto... its massive...wait that's not right... its MASSIVE, that's better... its quite funny.... even the street signs are in Chinese and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who was white in there. It's like being in China all over again... the people the noise :/  Ah well...  Back to Able and Baker :/  Meh...

      Meh...:P  Don't worry Jamie, I won't take a rager as such.. just remove you from the writer list :P  I admit the "Meh" and "Bleh"s may get a bit boring...but hey... I might be dictionarily challenged... but I don't tell girls they're weird on a first date :P or talk about the weather *muffled laughter*  anyhoo... I've changed the descrip about the blog... to something more appropriate... considering what it started as, (me ranting...and rambling) to what it is now, (the three of us having a go at each other), so why not...  Sit back folks, and enjoy the show...   By the way, I was never the happiest man in the world, ask anyone I know...  the normal reply is that I'm constantly in a depressed mood... which isn't all that far off...  Everything going okay in the land of nod... or more commonly known as Canada... althoguh I did learn something about them today...  Today was Canada day...think... 4th of July for (obviously) Canada... and we went to a park where they were celebrating... it was all quite normal until the speeches came... they had this Health Minister Guy... Here was the general gist of the speech:   Canada is a great country... blahblahblah... I'm honoured to be with you all to celebrate the 137th birthday of our country...blahblahblah...Canada is greatest country in the world...What is the greatest country in the world? yes... Canada... etc etc    Canada is the greatest country in the world???  Gimme a break... and I thought Americans were self centred... :/  That's it from me for now...   Miss Emma... :(  Bleh...

      Mr smart ass simon with his come back again. Me = unl33t. :/  Right . Anyway, moving away from such unpleasent matters. No fun 2day. Did great in Morrowind, till i lost around 2 hours of gaming when the bloody game crashed to desktop for no reason. As reliable as a pile of dog crap, I tell you. Wheres the fun.  Simon's off to South Africa soon. To some nice 6* hotel i presume. I'll just have to do with my 1/4* bedroom :\ Fun, fun, fun. Well, look on the bright side. I've got an great window to look out, and then I will see something Simon won't see in S.Africa! Rain! Hahaha! :/  Anyway, wasted half a day and created  urlLink this . Yes, my dev log/blog. James will take a rager at me, but at least I won't die?! Will i??! Uhoh... Kinda expecting a knife across the ocean being thrown at me...arghhh   tribute to thy l33tn3ss Dragontail

      Today was quite a mediocre, dull day, nothing much happened, Jamie seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth, or just to Morrowind *glares*  There is nothing wrong with "meh" and "bleh", especially those who are dictionarily challenged :P  Jamie is the most unl33t person I've met (TMPed...hahaha)  2 days!!! :D

       Bleh...  I be back!  *looks around*             *Tumbleweed blows past*    *sigh*   Ah well, I'm wrecked after 3000 miles in 4 days,  Day by day then...   Saturday    Got up at 5:30AM, no idea how and when I got on the coach, but I did, and we set off for the border...  At about 10 we get to Rainbow Bridge, the main crossing point at Niagara Falls, waited for a bit on the bridge for the coaches in from to get processed by Immigration and when the rather surly policewoman finished checking our papers, (my British passport got a raised eyebrow), we set off for the first stop, Boston.. Well, after another rather surly (Anyone spot a pattern here?) policeman told the driver "to get a move on"  Boston came, after about 9 hours, and we did a tour of Harvard. That was rather amusing, since they had a statue of Harvard himself, (even though they had no idea what he looked like), the wrong date for the founding of the school, (1638 instead the actual 1636), and had some completely random person added to the list of founders...:/  After this it was about 8:30, so we got to the hotel, dumped various things, and looked for somewhere for dinner. Nearby was Quincey Market, with its multitudes of fast food places and shops. More interesting was the guy doing comedy outside. He wasn't bad, although the most amusing part was when he performed the "sexy trick", which he claimed "everytime I've done this trick someone from the audience comes up and kisses me" Yep, sure enough, after his first failed attempt a woman from the crowd comes up and kisses him,  but  when he succeeds the second time, four men come up in succession to kiss him, more disturbingly, a 5 year old also went up...  Well, after that my view of Americans went on a rollercoaster ride, the people at Immigration don't exactly push themselves to the top of my Christmas card list, but I suppose the new national sport of the USA is currently paranoia... some decent comedians though I suppose...:/   Sunday   Unsure of when I got up exactly, and since I can't remember it was obviously too early, left for New York, which meant another arbitrarily long coach journey...  Got there, eventually, and wandered about various places, Rockefeller Centre, (or maybe center, depending on preference), Times...uh...Blob? Seriously though, I can't really see a polygon let alone a square, so best word to describe it would probably be blob...  The next stop was the Intrepid Museum...  *Insert rant about stupid paranoid Americans here, use your imagination, the author is too tired*  We stood waiting outside for about 30 minutes in the scorching sun while the stupid security people checked out everyone...  *mutters*  The museum consists of the Intrepid Aircraft Carrier, Growler Submarine...  And a Concorde....  yep... a concorde...  anyway, because of renovations or something you weren't even allowed on to the flight deck,  After that it was a boat trip round the Statue of Liberty,  I'll finish this tomorrow, too tired right now...  Meh...

      Just back from the caravan at Portballintrae. It was TIRING. Anyway, a brief synopsis and observations:   1) The sea  - Jesus, the sea is COLD. Even in a wetsuit!  2 ) Balance  - Balance is a wonderful possession, it's just that neither I nor my dad possess it. First of all, I, following the lead of others making fools of themselves, took a running jump from the harbour to land on the board. I landed on it, but not only did it tip over (like it did for everyone else) but it flipped up and hit me on the head :S Great. Then, on the donut with my dad behind the speedboat (great fun at 25 mph), my dad gets his toes stuck in the water and flies of the donut. Now, what happens to me sitting on one side of the donut if I suddenly lose 85kg from the other side? Splash. Great.   3) Sherbet straws  - I don't get how 340 sherbet straws can bring so much happiness to the lives of 3 12-year-olds.   4) Water pistols  - Long story short, girl with water pistol - with 5 nozzles, person annoying her. She shoots. She hits him with the right 3. Guess who's standing beside him...and where the other two went. :S   5) Random people  - The cousin of the person who owns the caravan 2 across for the one I was staying in was up to visit. Apparently she's in my year at Methody, yet we didn't recognise each other. Strange.   6) School of Rock  - We watched this last night. Is quite funny, especially James as the role of Laurence the keyboard player - "now is not a time for reading Laurence, now is the time for rocking" - hehehe. Bloody annoying Chinese subtitles on it though - why do they have random English characters in it though?  That was my weekend in a nutshell.  Simon - Don't laugh at me, don't look away (Keane)
