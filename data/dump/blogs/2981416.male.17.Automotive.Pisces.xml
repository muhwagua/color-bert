      Here's an interesting spin on the recent events. I know it sounds more like a good X-Files episode than something that could really happen, but if you read it to the end, Marc Perkel does have a point. This should at least be addressed. Check it.  http://marc.perkel.com/archives/000233.html

      I'm going to be doing a daily segment on here called "PIDL" or "piddle" for short. PIDL stands for "People I don't like." I will be writing about people who I dislike, and why I dislike them in an attempt to justify why I dislike this person. This is not to encourage other people to dislike them, and it is certainly not a "hit list" or anything of the sort. It's hard for me to explain, but this is just reasons why I dislike people. For example, why I dislike Michael Moore, President Bush, etc. My reasoning is usually simple.  There will be several chapters to the PIDL depending on how many disliked people I feel like writing about, and how many complaints I get for writing this. I know this is another controversial subject and that people are tired of my controversy. But I'm starting to like it.

      The title really has nothing to do with this, just a fun phrase I recall from my two years of Français and some tricks of the common keyboard. Anyway, I kind of got bored of the piddle idea and decided just to continue to be misterious about my dislikes and such.  First of all, I hope you like the new roses I added to the top. They seem nifty, but they'll probably look like shit on 800x600, but what doesn't? Secondly, I'd like to say that I think Islam is a noble and respectable religion and that it is being plagued by extremists and fundimentalists. Third, I wish to express grief that Richard Biggs passed away recently. Here's to a great actor and an awesome man.  Weird post, but this blog is sucking so much butthole, I had to post something just to keep things going.  "My loving heart, lost in the dark. Once and for all, and all for once. Nemo my name forever more."

      I redid some of the core things on the site. Now it's all pretty and the like. I might redo the cascade style sheet eventually, but it seems okay enough for now. I's liking the multiple banners and the roses on top. Feel free to give me more feedback, or if you want access to the news login (and hate the school district of hudson) let me know and I'll get you set up. Hahaha!  The 2004 hudson high school yearbook is pretty nifty. The True Blue Annual did a damn good job. Too bad they fucked up my order. Oh well, I'll get it tomorrow. I have a featured quote in the yearbook, just don't tell my parents!  There was something I wanted to bitch about, but it completely slipped my mind now, so I'll just resort to bitching about how the school district of hudson is violating our rights by seizing and searching any and all cell phones. That is pure bullshit. Bull. Shit. Oh, not to mention how they stalk students' websites, steal all the content (copyrighted or nye), and then play the blame game. Fuck that. I hope they all starve.

      Mindblock.net is getting more hits per day that CeruleanFantasy got in a month. This would have been sweet for me like, a while back. Ever since I lost CF though, I've sort of lost my passion for web pages and the whole spiel. I know back in the day on the CF forums with Tiffiny and everyone I was much more active than I am now, and I appologize for not being as active.  Promises that I'll post more and whatnot are not going to be made. I will continue to pay for and host this stuff for people who still enjoy this page. The NR Forum is a great hit, along with some other stuff that isn't linked on the main page. Shit.  Well, I hope you're enjoying... Maybe eventually I'll enjoy it again too...

      MindBlock.Net has issued a statement today explaining the conduct of the staff who post items and information. This is the second time the actions of the web ring leader, Matt Sias, have been questioned. Disturbing statements about politics, religion, and race have been commonplace within this group. Most recently was the post stating that, "Islam is a noble and respectable religion and that it is being plagued by extremists and fundimentalists."  "First of all, I'd like to say [explicit] you. [Explicit] all our critics," Matt Sias stated. "Especially [explicit] the School District of Hudson."  When asked for further comment on the subject, the only reply given was a slur of curses and a prompt end to the conversation.

      In my opinion, there is no greater human deed than sacrifice for another person. The person who stands between a friend and the world, if only to say, "You're wrong, my friend is right." I would like to thank a very good friend of mine who has sacrificed for me time and time again. (You know who you are.) Indeed, I believe Jesus's good friend John agrees with me as well. "No man has greater love than this, to lay down his life for his friends" John 15:13.  Thank you, my good and dear friend.

      Ever wonder why March, April, May, and June aren't known as the best time of the year? Because it is not the best time of the year. Spring is a time of restlessness and unease. The general mood of people decreases during the spring months. Most people are grouchy and sour without even realizing it.  There are many reasons as to why this happens each year. One of the major reasons is because spring is seen as a time of renewal and rebirth, yet people feel the same. They don't feel renewed or reborn. They feel like it is just another day, which leads them to feel let down. Most of this takes place subconciously and sometimes can even go unnoticed by anyone at all. Other times, however, it is a very external and even physical for people.  People are working the rust off their yard work skills which most would prefer to have left behind. Spring cleaning is absorbing energy and time as well, though it's proven by survey that no more cleaning takes place in the spring than any other time of the year. Throughout the year, there are always changes and adjustments everyone must make to continue on. This is definitely not true only to spring. Why then is spring such an unhappy time for most people?  Is it an exceptionally transitional time? Are people just bored? Well, maybe. But I think it's more of something rooted into human instinct that was burried, but did not go quietly that still brings this out in us each year. Interesting, yes?

      Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is definitely the best of the three released movies. It feels real, emotional, energetic, and just more of how a Harry Potter adventure should feel. Nice job boys and girls! 4.5/5.0 stars. Thumbs up.

      Back by request is the Flash section of the site. So far there are an amazing three files there, but if you know of a flash file you want me to add, just let me know.  Please, do not play games from this site at school. We don't need to get blocked for something so trivial. Or do play them, just don't get caught. Or whatever.

      Well, I went to my sisters 8th grade graduation yesterday, and it was kinda cool. I enjoyed it, and found it fun. And there was cake. Other than that the only thing going on is Final Exams. I am taking one right now, or I would be if I hadn't taken it last year. So with summer just around the corner, I think we should all get together and do something. Or not, doesn't matter to me.

      A lot of us want to go to E3. I suggest we start figuring out how we're going to get there quite soon. Perhaps starting our own gaming web site or something to that effect. We could always make some kind of crappy comic (just like Greg Dean did) and milk that for profits.  The bottom line is, we need to get a somewhat recognizable fan base before we should apply to E3 for press passes. I'm thinking we would aim for our senior year's E3, as we will all be 18 by then and such. It'll probably take some work, but E3 will be so big in two years, it shouldn't be too hard to land a pass.

      Could someone please show me where in the United States law it says that school administrations must be liberals? It has to be there somewhere. I just thank the Lord daily that my boss and the administration at work don't bleed green.  Ever since the turn of what we'll call the Liberal Revolution came to be, the generations that will be "THE FUTURE OF AMERICA" have been turning out at a regular pace. One prime example of a group of individuals turned out from the Liberal Education System (LES) goes by the alias Limp Bizkit. A large sum of their music bitches about the liberals they put up with. Interesting? No, not really. But what the libs don't see is that while they are trying to create tollerant breeds of next generation liberals, they are actually creating somewhat more morally sound conservatives. The system is painful, but working in the conservative favor. It's like when a human annoys a nest of bees. Although some may get destroyed, the majority just get pissed off and fly out of the nest and sting the human to an agonizing death.  Since the media sucks Al Gore's dick on a daily basis, they are quite unreliable for objective information. Though I am trying to keep out of the 2004 presidential stuff, I'd just like to point out the fact that everyone thinks Bush is so damn stupid, even though he graduated from Yale. He is probably smarter than 99% of his critics, although he just isn't good at public speaking. If you look at his choices retroactively, they are the right choices, where as Clinton's just seemed right at the time. Gore, however, failed out of no less than four colleges before finally getting a pity diploma. As for Kerry, can we say waffle?

      Today starts my campaign against the liberal hypocrits who run Hudson High School. The first stage of the campaign, will be exposing the full, complete, and honest truth where the school has been trying to mislead their pupils.  Here is the start of that.  urlLink The "News"  formerly on CeruleanFantasy.Com with comments revealing the truth.  Before anyone freaks out and calls the DNR on me, I would like to make it absolutely crystal clear that this campaign is 110% legal and non-violent. Absolutely nothing illegal or violent will ever be tollerated by my compaign.  "This is only the beginning!" - Count Dooku. "So it begins." - Gandalf. "Hold your ground! Hold your ground! Sons of Gondor, of Rohan. My brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come, when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of Fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shileds when the age of men comes crashing down! But it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you, stand, men of the West!" - Aragorn.

      It was a good week for crappy movies. Spider-Man 2 was not so surprisingly just as bad as the first installment. With the Spider-Man sequel, they had mastery at their fingertips, but instead of molding perfection with it, they stuck their fingers up their butts and sloshed it around with their shit until all that came out was boring crap. The best part of this movie was definitely the short lived action clips where Spider-Man gets hit by a train and loses his powers and falls to his near death. Oh, the opening credits were good too.  Fahrenheit 9/11 was also boring shit. I still don't understand how this movie won any award. It was boring and babbled on with jargon trying to make the accusations look intelligent. They did, however, raise some interesting views, such as how Bush values family and friends. I guess liberals agree that family and friends are not to be trusted and you should never associate with them. As for Michael Moore, can anyone else see the high volume of hypocracy in his works?  Spider-Man 2: 3.5/10 Fahrenheit 9/11: 1.5/10  Just a side-note, Michael Moore gave legal permission to download this film. Go grab it from  urlLink BitTorrent  or something.

      Many times I get asked why there are roses on this web site. Well, the answer is vague. Because roses stand for all emotions.

      There are rare occasions when I am, in fact, proud to be an American. These occasions are few, therefore I'd like to point them out. Again, I'd like to say thanks to Mr. Marion Shaw for standing up for his beliefs as he has done so many times against the worst odds. And so, here are some good articles by the people, for the people:   urlLink Cancer society official recounts benefits of relay   urlLink Town of Hudson parents oppose school redistricting   urlLink Looking for some answers to school redistricting   urlLink Asks candidate how he’d ‘strengthen’ public education  (By Mr. Marion Shaw)  urlLink Opposes embryonic stem cell research

      "I, Ronald Reagan, president of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare the unalienable personhood of every American, from the moment of conception until natural death, and I do proclaim, ordain, and declare that I will take care that the Constitution and laws of the United States are faithfully executed for the protection of America’s unborn children." -President Reagan speaking for himself and all of America from the presidential proclamation of January 14, 1988.  Hopefully President George W. Bush can continue the great work of former President Ronald Reagan by abolishing the slaughter of the human child. Even though recent events have been a disappointment to pro-life and pro-family advocates, Bush vows to fight on. Let him have our support. Perhaps even John Kerry through the power of his religion will see the error of his ways and aid the truth instead of fighting it. Let us pray for that.

      Finally some cinema redemption!    King Arthur. Yes, I'm a little late in writing this, but, it happens. Anyway. If you've read the King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table tales you will probably be pleasantly surprised by this interesting spin on the story. If you have not read them, or you are vaguely familiar with them, you probably will end up not enjoying nor grasping it as much. So... Great acting, classic story (kind of), classic characters, possibility of being true, kick ass battle scenes with a moral theme; sounds like a good movie. No! Wait, it is a good movie.    I, Robot. Willie's new flick. Surprisingly excellent. Probably the best film of 2004 I've seen yet. Excellent plot with many twists, violent in-your-face action, possibility of futuristic truth, cutting edge CGI (step aside, LucasFilm, Wingnut). It's hard to take your eyes off the screen during this one. Robot, Sonny is an incredible character, but what's most surprising, Sonny is CGI with a voice over! How often does that happen? It certainly didn't happen with Star Wars Episode I. Will Smith's character, Del Spooner, is a deep and real character and Mr. Smith plays him very well. This is no cheap rip off of The Matrix, this is a brand all of its own. The action scenes are intense and overwhelming. All in all, finally a great summer movie.    King Arthur: 8.5/10.0  I, Robot: 9.0/10.0

      As you obviously know, I am horrible at keeping my projects secret or even undertoned. So, even though I don't have much done on this story yet, and this part of the story will most likely change before I finish, I will post a little sample. This is the first original fiction story I have written in two years, so it just might happen to suck. I've been playing around with the idea in my head for a while, so give it a chance. Here's the first paragraph of the prelude. Tell me what you think.   Tales of the Fourth Army Volume One  Prelude  The Fourth Army only really consists of four warriors. Why they are still considered an army, nobody knows. Perhaps it is because of their undying will, or their unmatched strength of arms. Some believe the Fourth Army doesn't even truly know why they still call themselves the Fourth Army. The Fourth Army was originally one of the ten armies under the command of the Ecimir Empire before it fell. Each army had nearly one thousand soldiers strong and served the glorious Empire which spanned throughout much land. The capital of Ecimir was in the center of the vast Empire, located in the grand city of Ecim . From Ecim, the Empire expanding in all directions claiming lands and peoples as it went. Of course, there was no military might that could have stopped the Ecimir Empire; it truly fell apparent from the inside out. It had rotted at the core. Some of the good and loyal servants still served each other under the knowledgeable values of the former Ecimir Empire. Of these loyalists were the four men of the Fourth Army: Jerome, Bester, Gristan, and Gaul.
