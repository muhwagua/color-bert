       Oh, the burden!   Martin has some links on an issue that is crucial to me in a very personal sense -  urlLink Chile . There used to be a lot of Chilean refugees in Italy post 1973, and they shaped my ethics, and my politics, and my sense of music too. So I'm mirroring his link.   He also  urlLink sets very high standards for his blogroll  - and includes me. Gosh. I'm a bit humbled - I guess I'll have to live up to it. This means I'll have to read  urlLink George Orwell's Politics and the English Language .   I agree with most of his points, though I have to admit that links from my booklog to Amazon will earn me some pennies. Er. I've got to think about this.

       Revamped Anthem   Apparently, I had overlooked the fact that the national Anthem has, in fact, been sort of shook up a little to get the baroque and martial accretions gained over the ages fall off from the score. We have gone back, they assure us earnestly, to the orginal, "be it good or bad", as even our President Ciampi had to admit while talking to the National Socced Team.   Anyway, you can find out more about the hymn  urlLink here  than you probably ever wanted to. Everything is in Italian though - the Presidency did not think foreigners might be interested, obviously. I should scold them, but them they might follow me back here and be duly outraged by my lack of respect for the Symbol, "be it good or bad". In theory there's a "hear the anthem" link, but doesn't seem to work. Pity. Or possibly mercy, dunno.

       Singing the Anthem   While freedom of expression in this country takes unexpected turns (apparently, one of the points is that it's up to the Cavalier Berlusconi and his hench, er, collaborators to decide what is true criticism of him and his ways and what is "aggression", "partiality" and "violence") and if a journalist doesn't contradict the claim that the private TV is freer than the public one the concern is not if this is true but if he smeared the public image of the firm, one of the chief worries of our President of the Republic is if the Italian Soccer Team will finally start singing the National Anthem at the World Championship.   Now there are several problems with this. The first is the National Anthem itself. I guess not many of you can whistle it, eh? Thought so. It's close to a well-kept national secret. And it takes a  lot  to embarrass Italians.  The Italian Anthem is dreadful. The music is embarrassingly trumpety (it's hard to resist the temptation to go "Pa', parapa', parapappa-pappa-pa" at one point between stanzas). But not even the tune comes close to the horribleness of the lyrics, or as I once referred to it, its "high-falutiness". Anna Mazzoldi was prepared to me more indulgent with it:"Standard 19th century pomposity".  The translation gives but a pale idea:  "Brothers of Italy, Italy hath woken up Of Scipio's helmet it hath surrounded its brow Where is Victory? Let She offer her tresses That she is a slave of Rome, God created her!"  Most people are uncertain at what exactly this means. Who is exactly offering her tresses? According to Anna Mazzoldi,    No, no, no: "God made Victory a slave of Rome" is the correct reading.  So, the last 2 lines would be:  Where is Victory? Let her [Italy] present her [Italy's] mane to her [Victory] [so that Victory can crown Italy with laurel, presumably]: God made Victory a slave of Rome.  There are a few more verses too, and they ain't bad either ;-) They don't get sung very often, for some reason... The second verse starts:  The children of Italy are all called Balilla, the blast of every trumpet is a signal for the Vespers...  ("The Vespers" were a nationalist insurrection in Sicily a few centuries back. "Balilla" was a local boy who started a nationalist insurrection in Genova by throwing stones at the police ;-). However, "Balilla" was also the name for one of the age-groups of the Fascist Party's youth organization.) (Another age-group was "children of the she-wolf" -- I swear ;-))   There's also a bit about "Stringiamoci a coorte, siamo pronti alla morte" (Let's draw up in a cohort, we're ready to die), that must have a superstitious people like the Italians in a frenzy of anxiety.   So text is difficult, close to nonsensical, alarmingly resonant of Fascist key words... it was chosen in the aftermath of the proclamation of the Republic (when the old Royal March was shipped off with the Royals themselves) as a sort of temporary anthem, but few people are enthusiastic about it. The vast majority of Italian don't know the words past the first stanza, and a lot of them don't know the first stanza either.  But lately there has been a resurgence of patriotic feeling. This has been a pet peeve of the current President of the Republic. He cares for it. He was seriously and publicily annoyed at Abbado (or was it Muti?) for having skipped it on the occasion of an opening at the Scala, and Muti (or Abbado) later made it up to him by producing an arrangement that made it a bit less offensive to the sensitive ears of somebody who cares about music. The President was pleased, an has been recommending the singing of the hymn since then. Being a widely respected figure, people have sort of shuffled their feet and mumbled a half-hearted promise to try to learn the words.   Apart from the soccer team, that is. I'm not sure what their problem is, if they have a deep aesthetic problem with the music or the text, or if they can't remember them from one match to the other - or, this being Italy, both things. Or perhaps they are just contrary souls. This being Italy an all. Home of contrary souls on stupid things. Anyway, at every interview they get asked if they will sing it this time around, and each time they shuffle their feet and mumble. We'll see, I guess.   It's a good thing I'll probably never stand in front of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, torn between the desire not to offend him (though he has somewhat disappointed me lately) and the resolution not to mouth what to me is an offensive piece of violent rethoric. Because I would never sing that thing, and the fact that I was brought up to follow healthy internationalist principles is only part of the problem.   I mean - if the Italian Anthem were " urlLink Va' pensiero ", I'd consent to sing it, despite my little enthusiasm for patriotism. Not only is "Va' pensiero" a wonderful piece of music, it is also much closer to values and emotions I'd feel inclined to share. The longing for a home that is lost and in ruins, for example - it would be difficult to find a more appropriate theme for an Italian Anthem.   Unfortunately, our pet xenophobic party, the Leagues, has pilfered it. They have adopted it as their own anthem - the anthem of the imaginary country they have been swearing alliance these last ten years  or so, "Padania". It's very hard to express the outrageousness and sadness of this thing - I can only say that I fully expect a rapid rotatory movement to go on in the vicinity of Giuseppe Verdi's grave.   So, no luck changing the anthem there.   But the fundamental fact is that I think that patriotism is anti-Italian. It's one of our chief virtues: the refreshing lack of any national pride whatsoever, the firm conviction that not only Italy isn't the best country in the world, but practically every other country is much better - as long as one doesn't have to live there forever, that is. The fundamental lack of enthusiasm for all the paraphernalia of nationalism, and military pride. This is a good thing in a nation that has listened to high-falutin' nationalistic rethoric once too often already. And so, basically, I think that singing a pompous anthem that proclaims Italy's greatness is, well... unpatriotic. A betrayal of the best values this country has managed to snatch from its shame.   However Claudio Amendola, a young and presentable Italian actor, has given me an alternative. He's sung it at the concert for the First of May, and it's being re-played over and over with cheerful wickedness by  Blob , a subversive program made up of malevolent stitching together of tv clips, so I could jot down the words. It's simply an alternative lyrics and it's just perfect in its self-deprecating grossness - very Italian. It goes like this:  Fratelli d'Italia ben poco ci basta (Brothers of Italy, we'd settle for little) la macchina nuova e un piatto di pasta (the new car and and a plateful of pasta) il calcio la gnocca, ed uno spinello (soccer,er... how can I put it? a woman, and a joint) Ma, attenzione! che non si puo' (but! be careful! that it's forbidden) Non si puo' non si puo' non si puo' non si puo' (this would be the paraparapara' bit)  The second stanza... But I think you have the picture.   Now  this  is a real anthem worthy of the particular soul of this country. Crass, stupid, and self-mocking. It's got the cars, the sex, and the tendency to take rules less than seriously. And it's deliberate effort to send up gravity and to thumb one's nose at pomposity. Yes, yes.   Who knows the real measure of their own patriotism? If it ever comes to chose between betraying my country and making a silly ass of myself singing about  la gnocca  in front of Ciampi, I hope I'll have the courage to sound stupid.

       The Berlusconi disease can spread throughout Europe    It's a bit annoying when somebody  urlLink (Martin Woollacott, in the Guardian)  comes along and in one essay sums up pretty much everything you want to say and the reason you want to say it,    "All that part of Italy that was instinctively entrepreneurial and individualistic, modern but vaguely Catholic, which had struggled ... to found the material wellbeing of families upon hard work, self-sacrifice and a cock-a-snook attitude towards the state, recognised itself in the smiling face of the tireless little Milanese businessman," writes the historian Paul Ginsborg. "On the other hand, that Italy which believed in the growth of a civil society, in the need to curb the vertical hierarchies of patron-client relations, in the rule of law and the fight against the Mafia ... was appalled."     and to hop up and down and scream it:    The tendency for politics to be seen in part as a branch of consumption and a form of entertainment is also generally evident. How to explain, otherwise, the prominence in the German election campaign of the issue of Gerhard Schröder's hair or, in the French, of Chirac's grocery bills or Lionel Jospin's squeaky voice? The standard issues that Berlusconi exploited to come to power, including crime, migration, nationalism, regionalism and freedom from state meddling, are available everywhere. The means that he employed, in the shape of greatly concentrated media power, a party strong in organisation but short on debate, and a ready recourse to private wealth, are less available, but there are no guarantees that the situation could not change.   It is worrying that Europe has accepted Berlusconi with so few reservations, an acceptance symbolised by the inclusion of his party in the Christian Democrat group in the European parliament in 1999. It remains to be seen whether Europe will change him or he will change Europe.    I'd like to be able to quote this  urlLink article  in full, but I'll just beseech you to go and read it. Please.

       More on Santoro   Yesterday, since  urlLink Santoro  wanted to tackle the difficulties he and Biagi have been having, he decided it would have been better for somebody else to play host to his talk show. He therefore called Maurizio Costanzo, his long time friend and a pillar of the once rival privately held Canale 5. The RAI management told him no. He had a contract, he was supposed to be the presenter, he couldn't palce anybody else in his place.  Santoro wiggled out of it by telling Costanzo that he must keep sitting, because he was the only one intitled to stand on the studio floor.   Among other things, Costanzo ended up saying that it appeared to him the journalists working for the networks owned by Berlusconi could enjoy more freedom than those working for RAI. Santoro did not argue.   This morning, the RAI management said they had involved three or four lawyers, to check wether this intolerable smear on RAI's image did not constitute a breach of Santoro's contract.   Let me sum this up: A guest in a programme in the public TV said that people are actually less free to speak their minds there than in the private channels. The host does not contradict him. He gets sued for breach of contract. Is it me or does this reaches almost kafkian heights of irreality?   I think the word in this case is "embattled". I'm wondering if somebody somewhere is wagering on how long Santoro is going to hold on before they kick him out.

       Department of Pet Peeves: Dulce et Decorum   This was the received wisdom of the ancients, according to sites I just googled in search of the right quote, and it was the Old Lie, according to  urlLink Wilfred Owen . Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori: It is sweet and decorous to die for one's country.   No, I'm not going to talk about war. It's not forgotten but I have to confess that I'm using Owen's bitterness for my own, far less tragic, purposes. The fact is, decorum bothers me. I think there's something wrong about it - or maybe the way it's used.  Perhaps it is because I'm a slob, and a very happy one at that. I care about beauty and appearances - hell, I'm Italian, after all - but I don't share the obsessive preoccupation of my mother for neatness and cleanliness and order. And my mother is not even a serious case: compared to what my grandmother was,  my mother is a slob herself. Granted, my grandmother had a full-time maid, and my mother an astounding (an incredible) part-time one, and neither of them worked full-time as I do. But still, I don't care as much as they do.   I'm still bothered by squalor and muck and neglect. My love for Sicily is a tormented affair on this issue - squalor in the South of Italy is something that you have to learn to sublimate out of in order to see the appalling beauty it conceals and shrouds, and sometimes makes possible.   But. There is something disquieting, something chilling, in valuing decorum above all else. Life is messy, it's movement, noise and dirt. This planet would be perfectly neat and clean without life - but subjectively, I wouldn't consider it much of an improvement.  This town I live in is run by a major obsessed with decorum. She is, I think, a good and decent woman, but I have to say that I'm not much impressed by her record as a mayor. And I'm frankly bothered by her insistence on decorum. It seems to get in the way of so much else.  Part of the problem, of course, is  how  do you define decorum. The mayor seems to think, for example, that inflatable huge publicity balloons or structures painted in primary colors and taking up most of public squares are all right on the decorum side. A substantial amount of one of the key pedestrian passages in Padua, right in front of the historical  urlLink Pedrocchi Cafe'  and a few paces from Belzoni's Egyptian cats (who gazed on stonily, not commenting) was occupied last year for months on end by a miniature golf course, with sand hole and miniature olive tree and real grass.   Conversely, people standing around drinking spritz (a cocktail made up, from what I could see, by mixing in whatever the barman has on hand and a bit of white wine) in the town's central squares are not decorous, and neither are the graduates' carnival-like celebrations, and neither are, come to think of it, the markets.   The people (mostly young, mostly students, mostly definitely not the mayor's electors) have been dealt with after three years of struggles, of fining patrons and bars for occupying public space, issuing ordinances closing down the bars earlier, and generally hassling people so much that the bars finally gave in and closed shop at seven pm - the spritz hours.   The graduates are holding on, among a flowering of barriers and the stuffing of the city center with town police during graduation sessions, and ruthless fining for misbehavior.   Of the markets, one is to relocate in ten day's time, to be moved to a peripheral square - for the time being, pending restoration of the square it's held on, but nobody knows if they'll be allowed back once it's done... it's such an attractive square and the market is starting to look not too decorous...

       Biagi, Santoro, Luttazzi   This is long, boring, and political, but I must tell it because it is a key story, in many senses. It's significant, and it's important, and it's, well,  impressive. It's part of why I'm keeping this blog.  First a bit of background.   Italy is one of the least literate countries in Europe. The vast majority of the population is made up of non-readers, and this means that the papers are read by a minority and the vast majority of citizens gets its news and its view of the world from the TV  exclusively.   There are six major TV channels in Italy. Three are public, broadcasted from RAI - Radio Televisione Italiana. The board of directors of the RAI is chosen by the Parliament, so as to reflect a wider representation than the Government. The board of directors chooses the directors of the three channels - Rai1, Rai2, Rai3.    The other three are privately held. In the beginning, one of them, Rete4, was property of a great publishing concern, but soon enough all three - Italia1, Rete4, Canale5 - ended up being owned by an up and coming entrepreneur who had made his fortune in construction - Silvio Berlusconi.   Exactly how Berlusconi ended up as virtually the only private TV broadcaster in Italy is an interesting story, and introduces the new concept of ad personam laws passed for the good friends of the Prime Minister (at that time, Bettino Craxi), but it'll keep for another time.  The fact that the owner of half Italian TV could end up controlling the other half has created a lot of alarm and disapproval around the world, of course, but as I noted, the RAI is on paper controlled by the Parliament.   The board the Parliament finally elected, though, is suspiciously close to the Prime Minister, because, after all, he enjoys a large majority in Parliament. This majority does not reflect the actual balance of forces in Italy, but this also is another story.   So people are kinda worried that we may end up hearing one side of the story only. I mean, the whole of the broadcast media controlled by one side, that would look sort of a bit on the alarming side by many. But Berlusconi apparently doesn't see the problem. After all, he says, he's merely the owner of Mediaset, which controls the three private channels, he has nothing to do with the management. And besides, he loves freedom of expression. He'll guarantee for it. It's just partisanship, lies and aggression he won't stand for. He will personally guarantee that no opposition leader is subjected to the shameful attacks he had to endure...   That's right. Francesco Rutelli, head of the opposition coalition, will not be accused of owning three national TV networks. Piero Fassino, leader of the major opposition party DS, will never be accused of having bribed judges to decide a business deal in his favour, or the Financial Police to close an eye on book cooking. They will not have the fact that they employed a member of a Mafia family as their personal holster used to sort of imply that they might have not disapproved of his connections...   Because Berlusconi has been accused of all of the above, and more. And he isn't happy about it.   Now some of the people who accused him of these things are, unfortunately, state prosecutors, and he can't do much about them, because the Judiciary is, alas, a separate power. But he's working on it.   However, some people who don't wear a toga picked up these claims, and it is crystal clear for him that such people, repeating claims like this in public, are a threat to democracy. After all, the people voted for him. This means the approve of him. Therefore, anybody who critizise him goes against the will of the people and therefore democracy. This is dangerous and should not be tolerated.  Many of these concepts have been expounded upon by Berlusconi during a press conference in Bulgary, where he was on a state visit. He called these threats to democracy by name: Michele Santoro, Enzo Biagi, and Daniele Luttazzi. "They have made a criminal use of the public TV, which is paid for with the money of all of us. The management should not allow this to happen again." He was willing, as always, to be merciful: "It they will change their ways, I have nothing ad personam against them. But since they will not change..."  Who are Luttazzi, Biagi and Santoro?  Daniele Luttazzi is long gone from TV. Before the general election that gave the power to Berlusconi, he was the host of a talk show not terribly different from Letterman's, say. He would joke, with a surreal kind of humour that often tackled the crass with an unfazable unflappable demeanour, and would interview writers, actors, and generally interesting people.   One of this writer was Marco Travaglio, author of "The colour of money", a book on Berlusconi obtain by stitching together documents - all rigorously available to the public - from the various trials he's embroilered in. Apparently, it makes for chilling reading... but was passing unnoticed. Until Luttazzi gave it the only kind of publicity that counts in Italy - a passage in TV. There is a transcription of the interview  urlLink here  - unfortunately, in Italian.   The day after the programme, the book was sold out all over Italy. The publisher rushed several other print runs. The author was promptly sued. But it was Luttazzi that got most of the flak.   Commentators thundered. He was a comedian, how did he dare talk politics? It was libel (talking about the book, that is. Apparently the book itself didn't rate a libel suit before that). The following week, Luttazzi's programme was suspended, while the RAI management panicked. The berluscones were furious. Luttazzi had another few instalments programmed - and on the last, said goodbye to the public with a smirk and a "I have this feeling I won't work for RAI any more." He hasn't been heard of on TV ever since, and has had problems securing theaters to host him.  But few days afterwards, the author of the book - Marco Travaglio - was a guest on another programme, and this wasn't a comic variety show - this was serious stuff, one of the pillars of public TV - Michele Santoro's  Sciuscia' .   Michele Santoro has long been a sore spot for Berlusconi. He affects not to know of him. Santoro has acquired the nickname "Michele chi?" because of this. He is certainly not a middle-of-the-road man. He has opinions and doesn't hide it. He is a provocateur. He is a clever, sometimes unpleasant, interviewer. But, since he thinks strong opinions and vigorous clashes make good ratings, he usually invites right-wing people (it was in his programme that I first witnessed the new communication strategy of Forza Italia, Berlusconi's party: to talk incessantly, over the other guy, repeating slogans ceaselessly and not responding in any way to what the other guy is actually saying, but simply ignoring him).   Michele Santoro invited Marco Travaglio and even showed the last interview with Paolo Borsellino, a few days before he was blown up with all of his escort in Via d'Amelio, in Palermo, in which he talked, among other things, about Berlusconi's mafia-affiliated holster.   A second, stronger storm hit Santoro after this. But he wasn't a random comedian with a short-term contract: he had high ratings, and a rock-solid contract, and was probably among the ten most celebrated TV personalities in Italy. This wasn't the first time they had tried to shut him up, and he was still there. He still is - as a matter of fact, the last scheduled broadcast of his programme goes on the air in a few hours today.   But if Santoro is a brazenly left-wing, controversial character, Enzo Biagi is the doyen of Italian journalists now that Montanelli is dead. (Montanelli is another doleful chapter in the long and painful story of Berlusconi's relationship with the press - he had been the director of a rabidly right-wing paper sponsored and paid for by Berlusconi, and had been more or less ousted because he had not approved of his entry into active politics). Enzo Biagi is an old - 82 - and thoroughly respected moderate journalist. He is everybody's stern and old-fashioned grandparent: very Catholic, very proper, socially conservative, politically spot on the middle of the spectrum. The champion of unsensational journalism, of English propriety. Enzo Biagi is the old school. And, as such, he has a deep suspicion for demagoguery and populism. That is, he's not a Berlusconi fan.   He has been a journalist with RAI for the past forty-two years. He has been there forever, and his programme, The Fact, which goes on air just after the main news of Italian television - TG1, the news of the First Channel - is nine times out of ten the highest-rating programme of the whole public networks.   He is scrupulous in how he conducts his programme. Each left-wing commentator must be balanced by a right-wing one. Sitting completely still at his desk, like a white turtle, he asks his question in a polite monotone. What has this champion of facts before opinions done to gain such wrath on himself?  He's invited Benigni, of course.  Benigni doesn't need Berlusconi to work and cannot therefore be threatened or intimidated. He doesn't scare easily, and he has the sharp, vicious, and irresistible humor of the Tuscans. A few days before the elections, he was asked by Biagi, on prime time on the major Italian tv channel, what he thought of Berlusconi, and he let fly. People laughed themselves silly. Berlusconi wasn't amused.   So there it is: a comedian who dared turn the spotlight on an unauthorised biography; a talk-show host who hosts Berlusconi's enemies ans asks rude questions; and a very proper journalist that dared make fun of him. They are all, according to Berlusconi, criminals. Among them, according to Berlusconi again, they made him lose 17 points at the elections - this in itself, one feels, is in his mind a crime.   After his Bulgaria press conference, there was turmoil and scandal. The opposition cried censorship. Santoro opened his next Sciuscia' by ambling around the studio humming "Bella Ciao" under his breath.   And I thought, and said: Santoro and Biagi are there and won't go. It's impossible to kick them out, they are too famous, too celebrated, too respectable. Disappearing them would smack too much of censorship - it can't be done. It's in bad taste on Santoro's part to hum that song, as if he too was threatened with death and torture as the Resistance fighters whose song it is were. He'll stay there and he knows it well, he's needed to provide a cover, a fig leaf over the wider censorship.   Santoro and Biagi are not in danger, I said, this is not intended to scare them. But the young journalist just signed in at a local RAI office? The writer just starting on in one of the great newspapers? They know, now, what can happen even to the greatest of their trade of they displease Berlusconi - this is intended to make people shut up of their own spontaneous will. This is to ensure that no other Santoro will grow up.   I was wrong.   The new management has been telling Santoro things. His programme is stale and boring. Yes, yes, he still has high ratings, but it's time for a change. Shift it to another day for a start, and then... well, RAI 2, his channel, is due to become a federal channel. They are more interested in entertainment than news or commentary. And his contract... well, nobody's actually irreplaceable.  As for Biagi, his contract is due to expire next December. His programme is due to be suspended for the usual summer pause on May the 30th. According to him, on the fall schedule there is no mention of him. He hasn't been told anything, despite having asked. He sits there and says: "I thought we had dealt with this people once and for all in 1944."  Do you see why I'm a bit nervous keeping this blog?

        Just heard    "Everything is all right, and that frigging Communist journalist has been dealt with". These words have, reportedly, been pronounced by the head of Italian Intelligence, SISMI, after the killing in Somalia in 1994 of Italian journalist Ilaria Alpi, a reporter for TG3 (the news service for RAI 3, one of the three public Italian network), who was investigating arms deals in Somalia.

       I won't be linking much from this blog.   Partly because I'm terminally lazy and not much of a surfer anyway - but mostly because it's a bit futile to link, say, to a page of an Italian newspaper. Besides, I don't like cross-referentiality much. I try to provide content... maybe not very interesting, but mine.  I've thought about this. I'm going to comment on things you folks out there have few chances of disproving. You've got my word on it and that's about it. I can try to be fair, of course, and I will, I will try to be factual, but there are limits on this, and one of them is that I want to be able to speak my mind with a minimun of self-censorship.  So treat everything I say as a primary source - not necessarily a hundred per cent reliable, but significant.

       This is actually an old post, from March 28 2002, before I had managed to work out how to keep a blog.    Today I went in search of things to bake a pastiera with. A pastiera is a cottage cheese cake that's traditionally prepared in Naples for Easter, and therefore not exactly something I can claim blood affinity with. My friend Paola, who is from Naples (well, actually from the vicinity of Amalfi) used to prepare it for me, and now I'm returning the favor.   Padua was full of people shopping for pastiera. Cooked wheat was everywhere. All of them Neapolitans? Perhaps. There are lots and lots of them, just as there are lots of sicilians.   I'm not from Padua. I've lived here for more than fifteen years but, like the neapolitans looking for pastiera ingredients, I'n not one of _them_. I went to see my friend Riccardo in a play by what is probably Padua's most celebrated son, Ruzante, and I couldn't understand word one of it. I got the gist - and the final invitation from the whole cast to the public to come down and share in the food on the loaded table: "El pan! Vida! El vin! Vida!" - but little else. I've lived here most of my adult life but I don't speak the language. But then, I never did speak the language of the place I was born in, either.   As I was cycling back the moon hung in the sky, still meekly turquoise long after sunset, over Prato della Valle. It was a fat, serene, slighlty yellowing moon, and it hung there as if by her own determination. Prato della Valle always keeps some surprise in store for you, when the weather is like this, clear and luminous and soft. Soft may well be the word that sums up this land. Soft colors, soft voices, soft noises. Pale hues, slightly fuzzy edges. Two days ago I passed through here earlier in the day, when the sun was just beginning to acquire that pink-orange tint it has in late afternoon. The sky was clear, the facades on the east side of the huge round square seemed to strecht and blink in the soft light, for all the world like huge ginger cats sleeping in the last patch of sunlight.   There is something about Padua at his best that pierces you. The light does it for me every time. Clear days are not that common, but when one comes along it stops you in your track, forces you to look at it. The light is not the golden, glorious, almost palpable light that paints evetyhing in a warm clarity in Rome; not the windy and broiling crystal light of Palermo, with its hard edges and stark shadows; not even the dusty glory of ochre and tan and yellow that I remember from my one September in Brindisi. No, Padua has discreet hues, a soft blue, a quiet pink, a mild orange spread by sunset on marble walls. Fog is never very far away, or better still, nothing as decided as fog, but the haze, the blurring, that reminds you that the normal state of the sky, here, is a lowering white that lets no cloud formation be discerned, a stifling and depressing sky, softening everything into drabness.  This land is my land, whether I like it or not. Not in the sense I was born here. I wasn't. Not in the sense I speak the language. I don't. Not in the sense I am particularly proud of it, or that I like it in particular. In the sense that I have to care for it. Some corners I'm very fond of. Others make me furious. But they are my responsability, because I understand them.

       Today - well, technically it's just past midnight, so yesterday - it was ten years since they killed Falcone.   The prevailing mood among friends and family is bitterness, and despair, and defeat.   Ah well - but he's gonna end up on a stamp, so I guess it's all right.

        I don't know if this is such a good idea.   I have long been meaning to keep a blog about what's happening in Italy. Or maybe to Italy. I have just realized that this may, just possibly, come back to haunt me, that it can hurt my career, my chances, and generally myself. Yes, I do so believe.  I'm not telling you that I   know  it will... but it's not good news when you are afraid to talk about politics in your country because you suspect it will hurt you.   This is a depressing time. It's depressing up, down and sideways. I'm not an optimist, and have been accused of elitism for this. But... well, I'd love to think that my despair is personal and temperamental.   I don't know how often I will have the heart to post. Will it be any use? Will it serve? It may serve me. I have to survive somehow the death of most things I love about this country. Italians are mostly not patriots and I love them for this, as I love them for many less than obvious virtues. We are not proud about our country. We are not proud about ourselves. We are mostly ashamed. "Shame is a noble sentiment" urlLink  Marco Paolini  said. Yes. Shame is our best virtue. So this is a diary of my shame and anger. The best Italians down the ages have been ashamend and angry, and often have been branded cynical for this. I think it is on this shame, and anger, and even cynism that this country survives with some dignity intact, and most of its sweetness and humor.   I'm aiming for humor. I suspect I'll mostly miss. I expect a lot of outrage instead.

       1966, again   Allright - now that everything is over and the Italian soccer team is holed up in the shower room weeping over each other's shoulder, I can own up to it. I rooted for them. Not that very much, and for a whole lot of strange reasons, but during the last ten minutes of overtime I  was  buried under a pillow and moaning.   Partly it was because of the surrounding ambient of friends and relatives that were living the thing with authentic passion (up to and including the friend who unplugs the phone during and after to be able to grieve in private). Not to mention the neighbourhood - some heroic workers were tearing down a garage opposite, and though they arrived at the workplace a bit later than usual they did arrive and they did start working, when the second time was still running. In this they were a lot more conscientious that the members of the Parliament, who stopped the session and divided along party lines to go watch the match in the respective group rooms. At the end, somebody walked out to inform the workers of the outcome: "How's it gone?" "As usual. They fucked us."  Because in the end, in Italy, it's always the referee's fault.   Partly it was because rooting for the other team is, in Italy, such a seriously grave and heinous crime that it can inspire a certain revulsion even in those that don't give a toss for soccer  and  the nation.   Partly, and mostly, it was because how can you resist rooting for the underdog? For a team made up of, granted, overpaid big boys, but of such candid stupidity and tender emotional fragility that you can't but feel a bit sorry for them? For the robustly old-time coach that sprinkles blessed water over his boys? For the team that has to score three times to make a point because two out of three scores are annulled (and it's a moot point if rightly or not, when facing the touching look of horrified surprise on the scorer's face)? For the team playing the home team with a referee from the same nation whose team it first kicked out of the Cup?  So in the end, I was genuinely sorry.   A few hours after the match, one of the TV news - TG3, the one that's supposed to be on the left - ran an interview with the coach and for an embarrassing moment the caption appeared "Giovanni Trappattoni - Prime Minister". Don't we wish. If we'd won the Cup, it would certainly have transpired that it had been Berlusconi's doing, which was one of the things tempering my distress this afternoon. As it is, it was him that fired the preceding coach, Dino Zoff ... And, since he seems to enjoy so much the interim of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, why can't he take over coaching the National Soccer Team too? He'd have fun and we'd have, well, another Prime Minister. I'd gladly take Trappattoni.

       ...But the sky gets bluer and bluer   In the one sunny day of this wretched end of the spring in the North-East, Padua stopped to let the Gay Pride Parade go by, and rushed up to look, with an uncertain smirk, and occasionally cheer.   Two years ago I had been to the 2000 parade, pointedly re-named "World Pride", and stubbornly held in Rome during the Jubilee on the face of ever-increasing shrilly advice to cease and desist from the Church and from the usual faction of Italian politics that thinks it's much better not to annoy the Church. Among this faction was, painfully, numbered the then Mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, who rather fancies himself a left-wing man and later tried to head the Center-Left coalition. He announced that he would support the parade but, when things got going and the Church started moaning aloud, retracted and abjured. He lost the election, can you believe it?   Padua's parade was loudly protested as well, but curiously enough not by the local Church, which kept a low-profile and even made cautious opening moves, demonstrating a refreshing tolerant attitude. No, in this case it was the, well, the fascists who protested.  I cycled by them on my way to the rendezvous point with the rest of my  urlLink Amnesty group, that took part in the parade (torn between embarrassment and genuine emotion) . I would have liked to take a photograph but cowardly decided that there was no point in being provocative at this point.  It was three pm and they had a huge stage put up on the major Paduan square, Prato della Valle, in front of Santa Giustina and not far from the Santo - the Cathedral of Saint Anthony - holy of holies and important tourist, er, pilgrimage spot, laying in wait (the Santo, not the fascists) for the great celebrations for St. Anthony's day the next week. Padua's Town Hall, who discovered at the last moment that they couldn't give the public space of the municipal building to the Pride organizers to host conferences, because said spaces were suddenly found out to need air conditioning installed  immediately , the same administration that is bothered by bars placing chairs and tables not of the Approved Model on the streets and squares, apparently had no qualms about conceding a very important spot to New Froce, uhm, sorry, Force, the fascists.   Now we have post-fascists and unrepentant though getting on the old side fascists, but these are the real thing - or so they obviously believe. They had red, white and black banners which stopped one segment on this side of being swastikas. They had powerful PAs the blared heavy-metal music about WAR (which the song seemed to consider with a lot of satisfaction as an experience in itself). The stage was plastered with the same posters they had put up here and there on Padua's walls (very quickly torn down by unknown but obviously almost unanimous hands): the photograph of a very tall and powerful black man kissing a slighter and shorter white man with spiked hair, and the caption NO TO GAY PRIDE, and, smaller: No to peadopornography - Italy needs children, not homosexuals. They had announced that they were going to stop the parade "with their bodies" which caused a lot of surely intended mirth all around.  They have contributed crucially to electing our current mayor. No, I'm not kidding you: their leader conducted a rabid campaign in favour of the current mayor, who ended up winning by a margin of about a thousand votes - more or less the votes the FN can swing.  Now there was a lot of unhappiness about FN demonstrating against the Pride on the same day and hour as the parade, and being so obviously favoured by the city administration. So much so that a faction of the demonstrators, roughly the anti-globals, announced that they were going to try to stop the FN's demonstration. The Pride organizers begged them not to do it, and at the last moment, after a lot of bold announcement to the contrary, they let themselves be convinced. This was a last moment decision though, so Padua was attended by a thick contingent of policepersons and carabinieri in riot gear. Going from Prato della Valle and the FN's sparsely attended fortress up towards the concentration point for the Parade I kept seeing cars and jeeps and vans (some of them protected by steel grids) and buses filled with grim-looking policepersons, some of them bedecked with padded armour. When I arrived at the concentration point, there was a human wall of police with plastic shield on either side of the streets.   I felt sorry for them, scary as they looked. I didn't know about the anti-fascists no-globals last-minute decision not to seek battle after all, at that point, and I felt a tiny bit like going up to them and wishing them good luck. I don't wish being beaten up on anybody, and I didn't think - no, really - that if the antifascists wanted to walk up to the fascists and try to stop them from holding their own parade they deserved all they got. Still, both demonstrating groups sounded like they really were looking forward to beating each other up, while the police looked like they really could do without it. So I felt sorry even if I was acutely conscious that if things went bad, I could well end up on the wrong side of those shields and batons.   They looked on with unreadable expressions. When, later on, I managed to get a snapshop of a clutch of them flanking (and protecting) the parade, the photograph turned out to show stony, perplexed, and bored expressions, and a smirk that might have been mocking or might have been delighted. According to reliable sources inside the gay community, a lot of them could well have marched, after all.   Around seven pm, when the parade was over and we had set up our table in the square where the organizers were giving inaudible speeches (because we had ended up near a group of drummers), my partner phoned all worried because he said he'd heard of disorders on the news. I reassured him and told him that they didn't reach us, but today on the papers no mention was made of any kind of disorders, so it might have been a case of expected news not materializing in reality. At that point, the square was encircled by another solid wall of plastic-shield bearing police or carabinieri, but the shields were firmly pointed _outside_, and when I tried crossing the line I was stopped with firm and utter politeness and re-routed toward another entrance.   At the end of it all Alessandro Zan, chief organizer of the event and shy engineering student , thanked the police, "those that never get thanked," he said," and that on this day have protected and made possible a democratic demonstration", and went on to pointedly compare the Quaestor's (the town police chief) behaviour to the Mayor's. Everybody clapped. The police and carabinieri kept looking on in professional neutrality.  But let's tell this in some kind of order - I got to the large avenue were the parade was forming up and didn't locate the Amnesty people for a while. Instead, I saw the  urlLink atheists , the GGIL - the largest, oldest, toughest Italian union, proving the "order service", that is the security - the Sinistra Giovanile with its red flags and people donning  urlLink T-shirts with a red rectangle and "Another World is Possible - Genova 2001 - I was there" , and the Radicals (who are, because Italy is a curious country, in gross approximation on the right), and of course, the GLBT.  urlLink Some of them colourfully provocative , most of them  urlLink very, very normal despite their best intentions . Especially the women, because, as the local paper uncharitably notices "the appearance of gay women is the height of reserve and measure". And one  urlLink Filipino  in traditional costume, feathers and all, smashingly beautiful and very happy to be photographed. ( urlLink And some hetero infiltates, of course. )   They look so normal that one of my fellow standard-bearer looked at me and told me: "I think most people here are hetero". This was when we noticed that the whole of the big avenue running from the station to the city centre was packed with people - 20,000, Padua hadn't seen so many people on the street since the Alpine Corps held their annual meeting her. I shrugged and told him: "No they aren't. At best 40% are hetero. The fact is, there are lots of people you wouldn't spot, were it not for the fact that they're holding hands with some other guy or girl."  Our group secretary - who is a high-school teacher - kept being approached by students and ex-students, obviously very happy to see him there - and to let him know that they were. I wonder if it has dawned on him yet why they were there. At one point he turned and told us: "You know, the people looking on think we're all of us gay." A shameful shade of disquiet went through the Amnesty people - not one gay among them that I know of. But they kept marching. One guy came up to ask us if we were Amnesty's gay group. I don't know what Paolo told them - on the other hand, one middle-aged woman asked us, while we were waiting to set off, if she could march with us. "My heart is wholly with them," she said, looking around alarmingly, "but, well, I'm not gay."  The strange thing is that when I went in the Rome parade, my chief worry was to be sussed out as hetero. "If it's the  Gay  Pride," I wailed to one of my many gay friends that didn't go but were happy I went, "what's the point of _me_ going? I can't very well pretend I'm proud to be gay, can I? I'd be usurping somebody else's moment in the spotlight." My friend wouldn't offer such an easy way out. "They asked for the hetero to come and march together," he pointed out. Yes they did. All the same, I cut my hair very short and dressed in, er, a measured way then. My gay friends laughed themselves silly.  I didn't try to pass for a lesbian this time, and much of the point of the parade was that you couldn't tell, and that, as one billboard held by three women (parents, I think) proclaimed,  urlLink "We are  all  different."  And that nobody was alone, it wasn't an Us and Them issue, it was a matter of who was willing to fight for somebody else's rights and who wanted to deny them, or forget about them - and in Padua, the first were being cheered on and applauded  by the onlookers, the second  was proudly marching not a kilometre away with Roman salutes and Italian flags with the face of Mussolini stencilled on... all six hundred of them, apparently a huge turnout and deemed a wonderful success by their leadership. And the third... it was staying away, for all sorts of reasons, some of them not despicable.   All the same, as a collective coming out it is becoming less obvious, unless one wants to dress up in leathers or don a blue wig. And some, understandingly, don't. For now, they solve the problem by wearing T-shirts that say "Nobody knows I'm GAY", or, rather more subtly, COCK (with the Coke logo).   In Garibaldi Square, where the parade turned right to go towards Insurrection Square, right under the column that was built to house the statue of Garibaldi but that has a Madonna on it now (the good Catholics city fathers having removed the Garibaldi statue to a less central location about a century ago), two police vans with steel grilles were parked in a strategic spot with policeman poking up from the van roof. One of them was looking on, the other had a digital videocamera and was filming us. Official or personal curiosity I don't know. I smiled and waved.  urlLink The streets were packed at that point with curious but smiling people.  Some applauded. Some, from the safety of high-up windows, shouted insults. Most didn't - after all, if they were serious about the insults they'd have been with the fascists.   We arrived at the Insurrection Square, set up our table and started inviting people to sign for gay rights in far corners of the world. People drifted off. Drummers started to drum and dance. We bought beers. I bought a  nice Gay Pride t-shirt for a friend who hadn't been able to come.  urlLink The memory card of my digital camera  had long been filled up and I stored it with some regret. Another one of us had been going up and down, drunk on the joy of the photographer with lots of things to shot at, and was in her third roll the last time I saw her. The mayor, despite reportedly very touched by a meeting with the Parents of Gay Sons and Daughters, didn't consent to come down.   And that was it: nobody got beaten up, to the possible disappointment of a lot of people, nobody had a fit, the local bishop didn't report of being offended or hurt (thus gaining a lot of points on the Pope in my book), and people in general proved a lot less troubled by faggots at their most provocative than their government is.   A lot of the people interviewed by the local paper said that the great and terrible moment of coming out - "I'm gay!" was met with polite disinterest - "Well, yes, good. So what?" among their friends. No tragedies, no rejection - society at large is generally much farther that it looks like.   While I was walking away one truck was blaring out the same music it had been sounding at the beginning of the parade - Rino Gaetano. Rino Gaetano was ironic, sardonic, elegant and capable of levity and tenderness, and a particular brand of nonsense humour.  urlLink He performed in jeans and top hat . He sang in happy rhyming nonsense about no-nonsense women who did not seek a Pygmalion and tried to save their salary from inflation and couldn't wait for a new world to start, a world made up of sex. He died very young more than twenty years ago but every time I hear his songs he seems gone just yesterday, and much missed. Ironic, cheerful, devoid of carelessness, aware, and refreshingly free from cloying sentimentality. He was the southern Italian spirit at its best, shred of its rethoric, with all of its heart and mind intact. People were dancing. I was walked away by the sound of his most  political  song, a long cheerful listing of disgraces and miseries.  Those who eat once a day. Those who have short memories. Those who sweat, those who fight, those who eat once a day, those who live in a shed, those who live alone, those who live with little, those who play with fire, those who live for love, those who die on the workplace...  and the triumphant refrain, to which the people were furiously dancing, goes:  And the sky gets bluer and bluer .

       Once upon a time there was the war against the Mafia   Giuseppe Riina, son of Toto' Riina, possibly the most important mafia boss of modern times, has just been arrested on charges of extortion and "criminal association" (associazione a delinquere). His brother Giovanni is serving life for some murders done in their native town of Corleone.  Corleone has had for the last eight years a centre-left mayor, resolute adversary of the Riinas and their ilk - as proved by the insults and threats picked up on the taps on the younger Riina's phone.   But in the last elections Corleone has voted in, at the first turn, the right, as all of Sicily has been doing recently. Among the councillors chosen by the new major is the Riinas' lawyer, who is the Arts and Culture councillor.  But it isn't true that the battle against the Mafia is over, no.

       urlLink Avedon Carol  in her blog  urlLink talks about Bush's visit to Italy . Among other refreshingly entertainig things she says:   So Bush went to Europe and insulted national leaders, was downright nasty to a reporter (who had committed the terrible crime of addressing the French head of state as "Monsieur le President Chirac"), announced policies that scared the pants off of nearly everyone, and then decided to meddle in the Catholic Church's problems. Well, it may not be diplomacy, but ya gotta admit, that's entertainment! And it's okay, anyway, because the one country that matters thought he was just great. I am speaking, of course, of Italy.   Avedon, Italy was too busy laughing itself silly over Berlusconi's creative re-writing of basic history (among other things, he called the twin brothers whose myth is at the heart of the foundation of Rome "Romolo and Remolo" instead of "Romolo and Remo", kinergarten stuff here), his papier-mache statues and the determination to have the media devote virtually all their time to the Historical End of the Cold War Brought About Single-Handedly by the Best Politician Ever to Grace This World, i.e., Berlusconi himself, obfuscating this way the fact that said best polician in the world had just signally failed to win the local elections, to pay much attention to Bush.  As far as I can say, Bush is not really popular here outside Berlusconi's fond wishes. If anything, there is a pervasive and deep-rooted anti-Americanism that distress me greatly in its knee-jerk nature and in its peculiar marriage to an uncritical idealization of most things American (as well as, of course, in it being a fundamental dumb-assed generalization as all kinds of nationalism are).   Let's not confuse the scary scoundrel we have had elected over us with the totality of the nation, please. We're much better than that.

       urlLink Charlie Stross says lots of sensible things  about socialism and in particular what socialism really is in Europe.     Just about every Socialist I know thinks that, far from the Soviet Union's fall proving that Marxism is a total crock, the collapse of the USSR is the best thing that's happened to socialism for nearly a century. The entire ghastly Leninist experiment can now be laid at the crossroads with a stake through its heart and a garlic bulb in its mouth -- leaving the socialists free to get back to the main program, which is redressing the roots of human injustice and inequity.   I'm really not as optimistic as he is about the collapse of the Soviet Union being a good thing for the socialist idea, but the whole piece is worth reading.

       I'm not dead and neither is this blog   The fact is that I work as a translator. This means that I alternate between periods of bleary, frenzied overwork followed by burnout and periods of terrified anguished worrying that I'll never work again. I've been in the first phase since last Christmas and the burnout has caught up with me, I'm afraid.  With a bit of luck, by the end of next week I'll be human again. For a while. It's not that I'm getting any vacation, ah-ha, what a quaint concept. Just that I'll probably get to sleep for a couple of days.  My fond hope is that among the various human qualities that I'll be getting back then there'll be  the ability to write to this blog.

       I would do it again   Sunday afternood, about 5 pm, the fishing ship  Chico  from Porto Palo in Sicily was at the end of its third and last day at sea. Its crew had caught 49 swordfish. They saw a ship with 151 aspiring immigrants on board, in serious difficulty. They called the Capitaneria di Porto in Augusta and were placed into contact with the one in Rome. Scared, and worried of the approaching dark, they cut the nets, took the women and children on board, ran a line to the drifing wreck, and started off towards Malta, the nearest destination.   The situation on board was dramatic. One woman had a cardiac arrest and needed rescuscitation. Another fainted from exhaustion. It was while soccurring this woman that the crew revealed that they were being towed towards Malta and not Italy. All hell broke loose. People started jumping in the sea. The women clutched the children and threatened to follow suit.   At this point the captain received from the Capitaneria in Rome something that seems to have been along these lines: "Do whatever you have to do to save the lives of those people there, even if it means coming ashore in Italy."   Which is what the captain of the  Chico  elected to do.  Once reached Pollazzo, in Sicily, the captain and crew of the  Chico  were questioned by the police, and subsequently charged with complicity in illegal immigration, and the ship seized.   The captain is bitter. What he said was: "My father and his father have been fishermen before me, I know what it means to die at sea. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, because you're not even left with a corpse to grieve over. I am a seaman, and at sea solidarity is life. I would do it again."  A couple of years ago, a boat full of people - about 180 of them - sank off Porto Palo on Christmas night. News of the wreck came ashore but was not believed, because no corpses could be found. And no corpses could be found because the fishermen of Porto Palo, snagging first bodies and then parts of bodies and then bones in their nets, were spooked and horrified and siezed with pity - but they also knew they would be facing problems and aggravation and their ship stuck at shore if they reported it. So they chucked them overboard again. This went of for years, until the secret got out and one journalist followed up with the story, and Porto Palo was shamed, despite trying to explain that they would have acted much differently if those people had still been alive. Indignation was poured on the heartless people of the sea town who would chuck skulls and arms and legs back to the sea.  The wreck, and its bodies, is still at the bottom of the sea despite appeals from the relatives and several Italian public figures including members of both houses of the Parliament and a couple of Nobel Laureate to retreive it and give a proper burial to the bodies.   And when the fishermen of Porto Palo do happen on live bodies at sea, this is what they get.

       La mattina del cinque di agosto   Today the news on TV is unanimous in remembering the anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death. It took me a while to realize that "the fifth of August" tugged a very different memory in me. And finally I got it: it's the fist line of one of the most famous, and notorious, war songs in Italian history.   It has been officially collected in Novara, by a folk song researcher, from a man who testified to having it heard sung by the troops that, on August 10th 1916, took Gorizia. The battle of Gorizia (August 9-10) claimed, according to official data, the life of 1,759 officers and about 50,000 soldiers on the Italian side, and 862 officers and about 40,000 soldiers on the Austrian side.  I have heard it said that you could be executed if found singing it, which isn't all that unlikely, sedition being a serious offence then, especially in wartime. Nowadays, even the webpages of the National Association of Alpine Corps can offer its  urlLink lyrics , but not so long ago folk singers were prosecuted for public slighting of the Armed Forces for having sung it, and could provoke outrage by performing it.  The song is a curse, and a dying man's curse at that, of the object of the offensive, the city of Gorizia; and of the men who had sent the soldier to fight while remaining safely behind the lines; and of the whole concept of a national borders somehow affecting the nature and quality of the land. My parents and me used to sing it on long car journeys. You can hear it  urlLink here  (takes forever to load)  On the morning of the fifth of August The Italian troops were moving For Gorizia the far-away lands And grieving each of us left  Under the pouring water And a hail of enemy balls On mountains, hills and great valleys We died while saying this:  Oh Gorizia may you be cursed By any heart gifted with conscience Grievous was our leaving And return was not for many  Oh you cowards that now lay With your wives on wooden beds Mockers of us human flesh This war will teach us to punish  You call it the field of honor This same land beyond the borders We die here calling you murderers May you be cursed some day  Oh dear wife who cannot hear me I entrust to my comrades beside me To provide for my children While I die with your name in my heart  Oh Gorizia may you be cursed By any heart gifted with conscience Grievous was our leaving And return was not for all.  I have been thinking a lot about my grandfather of late, if nothing else because he was an enthusiastic swimmer who taught me to swim when I was less than a years old, and I've been dutifully going the swimming pool lately. And though he had not been in Gorizia, he fought for all of the First World War on the mountains. Actually, he was on the Monte Nero, I believe, and the Monte Canino, also recorded bitterly in song. I think I'll go up to Monte Grappa, to see the trenches and galleries, next week. The memory of the great carnage is never far away, geographically, but mine is the last generation that actually heard the stories from the living voice of people who had been there, and knew. I wish now that he's gone, as I guess every granchild ever did, that I had paid more attention to him.  Still, I guess Marilyn Monroe makes for a better story. It's a lot easier to dismiss her.

       How not to get people killed    urlLink Martin Wisse  (here I am, Martin!) has written about the huge demonstration that took place in Genoa in the first anniversary of the death of Carlo Giuliani during the G8 riots (let's call them like that) last year.   What's been remarkable is that this time, despite the danger of terrorist attacks having, if anything, grown, despite a death laying between protesters and the various police forces, despite anger and the memory of torture (because that's the name of what happened in Genoa last year, to peaceful protesters many of them foreign nationals), and the rest - nothing happened in Genoa. No shop windows where smashed. No cars burnt. Nobody got hurt. Upwards of 100,000 people marched and nothing got destroyed and nobody got as much as a bloody nose. Ok, some flowerpots near the the Brignole railway station got smashed. That's all.  Why? What was it that went so differently from last year? Is it that there were no violent elements, antagonists, violent anarchists, black block? No - they were there all right. Probably fewer of them but it's not the force of numbers that counts in this case. So what?  In part, this time around the mainstream leftist parties and the CGIL, the largest Italian union, came as well. (They even officially apologized for not having been there last year, took the requisite flak, and Luciano Violante, there to represent the DS party, in a press conference said: When you go wrong, you say so, and you take what's coming to you.) They have strong, and experienced, "order service", that is, security. Maybe it was that. Maybe not. Security was there last year too. I wasn't there, understand. So I have to go by what the papers tell.   And they tell funny stories. This is how Carlo Bonini chronicles the event on La Repubblica:   At twenty past six, the "blacks" have just gotten under the walls of the city prison of Marassi. They meet a Neapolitan policeman, vice-quaestor Angelo Gaggiano: not a wet pinko but the same man that ordered the charge in via Tolemaide last year.   Gaggiano marches up in the no-man's land between the police and the Blacks and takes off his helmet. Fifty meters behind him, his people. Fifty meters in front, maybe five hundred people from "Inmensa" and "Askatasuna". He shakes hands with their representative - roughly the same age but - the journalist notes - for all the rest divided from his opponent by all of life's choices bar none,more or less.   "Now understand me, guagli&ograve; (= guaglione, "kid", all-purpose friendly Neapolitan form of address). I let you get to the prison, with all that you shouldn't have. You give me a guarantee that you'll not be lobbing stones, bottles or molotovs against mine or the prison. That way, everybody's happy. If you don't keep your side of the bargain, you'll get charged. All right? Can you guarantee that?"  The other, not exactly a kid the journalist notes, is a bit vague. "Let's say that we self-determine ourselves as single individuals. That we demand the political agibility of acts of outrage."  Gaggiano turns, fiddles with his cell phone, calls somebody, maybe the quaestor. "Oscar? Look, this is how things stand here..."  Then he turns back. "Let's say I don't get precisely what you mean by acts of outrage. Let's say that I take it to mean a couple of firecrackers, all right? Is that so?"  "Well, yes, a couple, three firecrackers."  "Eh... let's not go over the board with this outrage, though."  "Maybe slogans as well. I dunno, murderers, things like that."  "Vabbu&ograve; (=allright), see what you can do for the slogans. Just as long as you keep those scarves off the face, allright? Gimme a break there."  Yeah - I don't know how much the journalist embellished events. I can just see this scene in any typical Italian comedy, with Ugo Tognazzi in the role of the policeman and Vittorio Gassman in that of the Black. And yet, you know, this  is  Italy at its ridicolous, childish best.   Anyway, Marrassi went unscathed, and so did the Blacks' outrage, and so did shops, banks, petrol pumps, malls.   But that's not all. Police consistently was visibile in front - and shielding - the carabinieri (it was a young carabiniere who shot Giuliani), but giving a wide berth to the demonstrators. Visible but not threatening. No tear-gas launchers in sight. No armour. Shields and batons in ungloved hands, and kept rigorously low. No menacing war drumming with feet or shields or batons. When the crowd got nervous, buffer distance was simply increased. Never was the crowd bottled in, and possible deflux corridors were always kept clear. People charged with keeping the peace kept their heads, even when spat upon freely.   Needless to say, no live bullets flew around.   At the end of the day, disappointment was expressed only by the handful of young people who attacked the flowerpots in via San Vincenzo. "If I knew it was going like this, I'd have gone with the Disobedients. At least they were a lot. What a shitty day."  And as a result, a vast peaceful body of civilized citizen could express their protest with all the protection that a democratic State should afford them. And that it should have afforded them last year.   Is this an unprecedented leap forward in sanity and competence? No. It's the ABC of crowd control, that all the Italian police forces have known and have been practicing for decades. I have seen much the same in Padua: young men who probably thought that they were being made to risk a beating (as Forza Nuova had promised) for a bunch of bloody perverts, but were there nonetheless, curteous and more than ready to protect the faggots and dykes from anybody who'd tried to stop them doing their thing.   So the real question is: why was this uccustomed sanity ditched last year? Was incompetence, confusion, panic the only reason things derailed so much? Or did somebody plan for disaster? And where did the people that tortured people in the Genoa barracks learn their trade? And who told them that they wouldn't be called to task for it?   The same people who loudly proclaimed their support for the officers accused in Naples of doing much the same things, things that would, that should, shame anybody wearing a uniform if true? And not claiming that those things weren't true - but that they were justified.

       Malefic fluid   The former President of the Italian Republic Francesco Cossiga is in Ireland, on vacation. He has just issued a press release in which he says that he is ill with a "constipation" whose origin leaves his doctors baffled, but not him: he knows it is the "malefic fluid" promanating from one of the advisors of the newly elected Chief of Superior Council of the Judiciary, the governing body of Italian Justices. The new Chief is an ex Minister, and probably felt by Cossiga to be a political adversary.   People in Italy have a tendency to mutter "Need to get his lithium dosage adjusted again, right?" when these sort of things happen with our former President. And they happen with a certain frequency.  You'd think this is a quaint and marginal character. Not so. Cossiga is a powerful and influential political figure.   Yeah, I hear the snickers. It's all right snickering for you, it's not as if you had him as a Senator for Life in  your  senate.

       We're not in it for the oil, oh no.     urlLink Peter Maas's blog  points to an article that clarifies what's in store for the disruptive Europeans that dare oppose the Imperial orders:   As The Washington Post helpfully explains, countries that support the invasion will find their oil companies rewarded with reconstruction and exploration contracts. Governments that drag their heels or oppose the U.S. will be shut out of a country that holds the world's largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. James Woolsey, the former CIA director, is blunt about the situation: "France and Russia have oil companies and interests in Iraq. They should be told that if they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent government, we'll do the best we can to ensure that the new government and American companies work closely with them...If they throw in their lot with Saddam, it will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the new Iraqi government to work with them."

       Socialism   And while I'm on the subject of Usenet, the huge advantage it has is that somebody will say the things you know you think and spare you the effort of articulating them, and in some cases of, er, researching them too. I've long wanted to say something about Socialism, and lo and behold a thread sprang up on rasff about it, and these posts, uh, had bouncing me up and down on the chair.   I bow to the wisdom of rasff:    Dan Goodman:   Roughly speaking, socialism means that the means of production are owned by _the people who work in that factory or business_. I believe that _in theory_, this was the law in the Soviet Union and other parts of the second Russian empire.  Under socialism, there isn't supposed to _be_ a national government or even local governments. Anarcho-communists believe that this can be done immediately. In the Marxist version of socialism, there was to be an interim government which would prepare the society for full socialism.  There is some evidence that Marxist-Leninist governments have not given the withering away of the State as high a priority as theory calls for. This failure has been variously attributed to Lenin, Stalin, and Russian tradition.    Ken MacLeod , quoting  urlLink http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/tmp/backward.htm   [...] this book, having produced a great impression on people who are really enquiring into Socialism, will be sure to be quoted as an authority for what Socialists believe, and that, therefore, it is necessary to point out that there are some Socialists who do not think that the problem of the organisation of life and necessary labour can be dealt with by a huge national centralisation, working by a kind of magic for which no one feels himself responsible; that on the contrary it will be necessary for the unit of administration to be small enough for every citizen to feel himself responsible for its details, and be interested in them; that individual men cannot shuffle off the business of life on to the shoulders of an abstraction called the State, but must deal with it in conscious association with each other. That variety of life is as much an aim of true Communism as equality of condition, and that nothing but an union of these two will bring about real freedom. That modern nationalities are mere artificial devices for the commercial war that we seek to put an end to, and will disappear with it. And, finally, that art, using that word in its widest and due signification, is not a mere adjunct of life which free and happy men can do without, but the necessary expression and indispensable instrument of human happiness.   and finally and most particularly - for all those people, yes Italian comrades I'm talking to you - who think the USA are a bastion of reaction:    Michael J. Lowrey   Last night, I went to a dinner with 700 other folks, celebrating the 90th birthday of Milwaukee Socialist and ex-Mayor Frank Zeidler.  The local Lutheran Bishop mentioned that when he came to Milwaukee, Frank gave him a tour of the city, and eruditely explained an enormous amount about Milwaukee history.  He called his brother in the Seattle mayor's office to talk about this amazing ex-mayor he'd met, and his brother said, "You mean Socialist Mayor Zeidler is a Lutheran?"; the Bishop said, "You mean Lutheran Mayor Zeidler is a Socialist?"  In Milwaukee, Socialism meant a lot of the lakefront and riverbank lands were bought by the taxpayers, and made into parks, instead of incredibly expensive condos.  It meant housing being built for poor people, and run by an agency responsive to the taxpayers AND the tenants.  It meant a pioneering Health Department, and good sewers, when such public improvements were scorned as interference by do-gooding busybodies.  It meant a world-class City Museum that was a haven for scholarship, with an extensive publishing program and even its own ethnographic and zoological expeditions to Africa and Central America.  It meant Mayor Dan Hoan trying to arrange a store to sell war surplus at cost to the local citizens, with nobody profiteering.  It meant a city government that kept its AAA bond rating, because the Socialists believed in pay-as-you-go government (they didn't want to mortgage the people's future to bankers).  It meant schools open to all the children without subjecting them to religious propaganda.  It meant the cleanest, least corrupt government this reform-minded state has _ever_ seen in its history.  It meant that when a former party leader advocated working together with the KKK because they had been so successful among working-class Americans elsewhere, the sonofabitch was expelled from the party and his vile suggestion denounced in ringing terms by then-mayor Hoan.  It meant trying to make the city a better place for honest working people, rather than running around posturing about how "revolutionary" you were (and being sneered at by the 'revolutionaries' as mere 'sewer socialists').  It meant, in Frank's own words, "a way of life based on cooperation, rather than competition."  --  Michael J. Lowrey proud, today in particular, to be a Milwaukee "Sewer Socialist"

       Whine, whinge, grumble    urlLink Avedon Carol , whose blog I follow religiously, has posted a  urlLink bit  about adding links to other blogs. While I was nodding along, I started up an internal whine: nobody ever links me, wee, wee. I'm in but a few blogrolls. Poor derelict me. And then the familiar switch to the Guilt Trip (tm): it's my fault, I don't post often enough, I don't write about the right things, I don't suck up to other bloggers enough...   And they I gave me head a good whack and told myself in a pure Monty Python voice: Stop it! This is silly!  I don't keep this blog for the glory. OK, I like the glory, but for godsake, that's not the point. It's not a race. It's not an ego thing in  that  way. I may pepper this blog with grammar mistakes and disappear for a long time and write rubbish - but you can trust me on this, I'm writing about things I care, and because I care. As Francesco Guccini says in  The Poisoned , I sing when I want, however I want, when I feel like it, without cheers or whistles, selling or not is not among my risks, don't buy my records... oh, all right, sounds much better in Italian anyway.   So well, I blog when I want, how I want, when I feel like it, without cheers or whistles, linking or not is not among my risks, shun my permalinks...  Oh, you're welcome to try for the final verse.

       Comments   Seems like comments don't work today. I'm not sure why, but while I try to work it out, you can use my email, which I just added to the template and will hopefully show up soon. Yes, that is a valid address.   I managed to access my comments on the yaccs page and saw that Gary Farber was disappointed that I never responded to a comment he made. Well, yes, I try to check comments whenever I can but I may well miss them. I spend far too many hours of my time on Usenet being interactive, and there are none left for what is, after all, a much more awkward medium of interaction as far as I'm concerned, that is, a comment box.   As a matter of fact, I'm a bit disappointed at the general move away from Usenet and towards blogdom. I like blogs, I read them with pleasure, I'm all for opening them to discussion,  but I don't think they can or should replace Usenet. I'm usually active on rec.arts.sf.fandom. rec.arts.sf.composition, it.comp.macintosh, it.cultura.fantascienza and it.arti.fantasy. I can easily be reached there.

       Tearing down the house   They're tearing down a house near my place.To be honest, it wasn't a particularly pretty house, one can even go so far as to say that it was unreedemably ugly. It sits on a T intersection and the side looking out on the main street is a drab two-stories oblong body, neither old nor new, of a depressing maroon color. On the side, coming out from the narrow street I live in, if you throw a look to your left side, there is a gate and you can glimpse the other side of the house, obviously older, painted white, looking on a grassy courtyard. It's no beauty either but a pleasant place to live, sheltered and sunny. The grass tended to grow wild and was cut down periodically by who knows whom - because the house was obviously deserted. There were trees, and it was very popular with the cats, especially when the grass was high.  I understood they were tearing it down because I finally worked out that the four concrete blocks they had erected in the fenced-in section of the street in front of the house were for a crane, and because they were throwing things out of the abandoned rooms in the back.  I stopped and looked and felt the usual stab of pain. Furniture, old, lumbering, ungainly and out of fashion, but obviously having missed its chance to become antique, was piled on matteresses and other unidentifiable debris of somebody's past life. When you see such things, furniture being cleared out from somewhere where people once lived, it means one thing: somebody died in there. An old woman, usually, living among her outdated things and finally giving up. When I was hunting for this house I saw a couple of houses like that: tidy, neat, sparse, with that desperate love for the physical objects that keep you anchored to your past. When my next-door neighbour, the lovely Dorina, finally died in her still lively and present 85th year, I saw the same thing happening: a lorry stopping outside, and people throwing out her things to be carted off. The big mirror of the dining room cupboard shattered. The dining room cupboard itself, a lumbering monstrosity in  well-cared for blond wood, was uncerimonially ripped from its nest and undignifiably shattered and loaded on the lorry.   That's what happens when people die, and of course there's no other way. People - children, if the dead had any - come and go through the heartbreaking task of separating out the chaff of your life, and the rest gets sold, if it can, or thrown away. Dying means this: that the things you cared for, that made your life comfortable, that have a piece of you in them, end up smashed and obliterated.   I left the condemned house behind (to be passed again and again, with constant regret) and bycicled off in the pleasant sun. September is a terrible month, with the same gentle cruelty Eliot attributed to April. Since Italy basically shuts off for August, coming to a complete and grinding halt while people go and do their thing at the seaside, September sees a coming back to life, which is the same thing, if I'm not mistaken, Eliot blamed April for. For the first week, while shops open up again and the traffic picks up and the incredible abundance of parking spots in the center evaporates, there is a Monday morning gloom in the atmosphere. It's still by all signs summer, it's hot and stuffy and the days are still long, but intermission's over, and from here on it's all a slide towards the long misery of winter.   Then the gloom wears off a little bit, kids go back to school, the pace picks up, and in the long slanted gentle shadows you begin to appreciate the gold in the sun, the soft breath of the wind taking off the bite of the heath, and it's still a month of pleasant evenings out, though you have better take a jacket out now. And the thunderstorms have left off almost completely. It would be a nice period to go to the sea if you could swing it.   It's a good period for the reckoning of what you've lost. Yesterday I went for the first time to the Busonera Hospital, once I think the Sanatorium, and though a friend had prepared me I was still gobsmacked by the rabbits. Rabbits everywhere, lean wary springly beasts eyeing you suspiciously and munching on the grass in the aisles, Richard Adams country. Amazing and marvellous for animal-deprived urban kids like me. I crouched down to get a  better look at them. The rabbits, as proper rabbits, sidled off. I wonder where they came from, if they used to be used for something hospital-related and then where freed or escaped. In all this wonder and grace we are both alive, me and the bunnies, and death presses in from all sides. To drive the point in, the TV has started two days ago showing burning buildings and falling people, spreading pomposity and fake sentimentaliy over it all like quicklime. I guess I'm in danger of adding my spadeful.   Yesterday during a nap a voice floated up to me, as things happen to do when you are half-asleep, stretches of fictional dialogue o random noise generated by your subconscious: I cannot talk about September 11, the voice said, a bit baffled. And as a matter of fact, I find it hard to do, for some reason. You think that what you have to say on the Big Solemn Occasion has to be of undying significance, and I don't feel properly up to undying anything right now. So maybe I'll end up posting this late. No big deal.   What I lost then. I lost the Manhattan skyline. Yes, I know, this seems awfully cold, but I'll get to the rest. For now - since it wasn't my neighbourhood and it wasn't my town and none of mine were there, I suffered no personal loss of a tragic nature. But I did lose the Manhattan skyline, for all time and all eternity. I'll never see it again with mine own eyes.  I saw it only once, for no more than a few dozen seconds, a from a long way away. I changed planes at New York to go visit a friend of mine in South Carolina, my only time in the States, and the only glimpse I got of the Famous Skyline was from the airport tarmac. I was sitting by the window in the plane, I pulled up the shade and there it was, black on gold in the sunset, unmistakable, and gosh, it really was like in the pictures. I gazed at it in wonder for about thirty seconds, then the woman sitting on my side growled at me to get the damn shade down that she'd got the sun in her eyes, and I, starteled, obeyed. Shutter down on the Manhattan skyline, well,  that  Manhattan skyline, for what I fondly thought was only the first time.   I know New Yorkers weren't so thrilled by the design. I liked them, though, perhaps because I saw them from so far away, and I could appreciate their joyous, fearless standing up taller than everything else in sight, and by a good deal, too. It didn't look an arrogant or proud standing to me, it just looked like a perfectly understandable ambition to strike a pose. Besides, I liked the way they unbalanced the profile of the land, introducing verticality were it wasn't supposed to be, introducing stark geometry were only geological fuzziness belonged. They made the horizon look like an ikebana, deliciously antisymmetrical in its paired symmetry. (When the stars threw down their spears, and watered heaven with their tears?)  I'm stupidly sentimental that way. Pulling down building gets at me even when there are no people inside. Were it for me, I'd build them back where they were, how they were. I would very much like to see their serene sharp geometry back. It'd be easier than replacing the Bamyan Buddhas, anyway. It'd easier than replace the people. It would be easier than erase the pain, terror, despair, agony. It all went down and it's buried in the past but it was there and we cannot unlearn it, I cannot unlearn it.   Some things cut at you because they happen to you, to yours. Some things cut at you because you see them. Some things cut at you because you hear them told. Some things cut at you because you're human. Some things cut at you because you are a good human.   The dead get at me a lot less than the dying. They're all dead now but I'm not the only one I guess that keeps imagining them dying. When I see dead, dead people fished from the sea after a wreck of immigrant desperation, dead people plopped down in the dirt shot, I always think of my partner. I always think that for somebody that body  is  that kind of death. With the dying, I see myself in them, I try to model the terror and the fear, and I guess I'm not the only one, and I guess I'm not the only one to understand that there is an unbridgeable gap between the worst of my imagination and reality, that I can only project about. I prepare my last words - what would you say, and to whom, if you only had five minutes on a phone?   People say horrible things about this, you know. I hear them. They say that too much fuss is being made. They say that they don't care. They remind themselves of the general reckoning of death, of human-inflicted death, and how much larger the toll of non-American still is. This is for me not so much wrong or horrible as beside the point. I don't care what nationality the dead were, I don't even feel the urge to remind people how many were not American to begin with. But the fact is, when you've spent so much time bothering people with the rest of the reckoning, in unsuspicious times, you feel precisely how to bring it up now, just as a way to redress the balance, would be belittling all those other tragedies. Things, like the Manhattan skyline, sometimes are in order even if they are unabalanced, with two sticky bits off to one side. People may bemoan the fact that no candles were burned for Srebrenica or Rwanda, but not me. I did burn them. I did mourn. I did try to get people worked up about it.   When Srebrenica fell I was in my parents' seaside apartment - as it happens, at the thirteenth floor of a smallish skyscarper  that looked over the Adriatic. I remember reading the papers on the dining room table, and the fuzzy black and white photo of a woman hanging from a tree. She had hanged herself in the woods, after having gotten away. She was alive and on the way to some sort of miserable but probably safe haven. She had escaped what would turn out to be among the worst massacres in Europe after 1945, and she hadn't wanted to live in the resulting world. The dead one forgets after a while but some sort of dying are harder to dismiss. That silent turning away from what the world had been revealed to be like was ghastlier for me then than murder. A lot less dramatic than jumping from the upper floors of a skyscraper, but it had much the same effect on me.   I was at a graduation party in the evening and I got drunk and I started taking people by the lapels of their coats weeping, telling them that they were cutting people's throats on the other side of the sea from us right at that moment. Nobody was paying my too much mind then, and yes, no candlelight vigils were held, but I did mourn. And now, well - people are finally getting worked up, and I'd be inclined to call it a progress...   Were it not for the fact that I lost - we lost - so much ground. On September the 12th last year I had the usual meeting of my Amnesty group - we meet every Wednesday night, we plan for our modest and locally ineffectual fight and we trade black humor over the nasty surprises the world springs on us. I went, feeling dizzy and dumb, and I realized in a flash that nobody was going to give a flying fuck for human rights from then on. Seeing a lot of human beings dying on live TV wasn't going to awake feelings of fraternity and a new understanding of the precious quality of human life in people, fuck no. Well, perhaps in a few. The ones that already were awake to it before. But for the rest - there was going to be righteous rage, and merciless fear, and if what I cared about  was dismissed as hilariously weak before, it was going to be branded downright traitorous now. Death and repression and torture would be welcomed instead of just happily let happen, and never mind that the victims counted the good and the bad, the misguided and the wise, the furious and the grieving. Never mind that humanity was a tresaure for humans, not for this or that national. Never mind. The time in between hasn't done much to prove me wrong.   The one thing it has done is teaching me the kind of fighting resignation that keeps you going. Oh yes, you and humanity spend the ages building, and then some murderous moron comes along and gleefully tears it all down, and calls it heroism. I am not an optimist. I am not a pessimist. I don't think there is a written guarantee in some Cosmic Book of Reckoning that the good, the just, the merciful, will prevail in the end. I don't think there is any malignant intention bending history towards evil. History advances haphazardly, and we can't derive any consolation at the end of our days by any progress made, because it can be lost in the next generation. Not by a will, but by something worse - chance.  You can only build back, and try not to make of the final result the yardstick of your happiness. You put one brick over the other because that's what humans do, and hope that you never find yourself wandering in that wood looking for a way out the unbearable pain of unconsolable grief and irreparable injustice. You shrug and go back to rebuild the wall even if you know you may never see it in your life as high as it was when you got there, though higher than it would be if you didn't. And try to find happiness elsewhere, in the pink glow of some sunsets that make you feel as if somebody switched a huge orange neon tube in the sky overhead, in the wary suspicious rabbits, in figs ripening in unsensitive innocence, in familiar music and new words, and such trivial things.   And yet, I can't understand how people can bear it to go on, how they can find any happiness in the nooks and crannies of the world, in the chinks of the world machine, if they lose sight of the backdrop of pain, if they can't feel the pain of every human beings as their own. It's only the general universal cruel and unfair pointlessness of it all that gives me the space to find solace and purpose. Given how it was unshakable faith in a purpose in the world that made at least some of the aformentioned morons believe that they could strike a great symbolic blow to something or other when they were just killing random people, feeling a vast cosmic pointlessness may make me less deliriously happy, but it sure makes me feel a lot more innocent.

       Mount Etna   I have been on the Etna several times, and once I went up to the summit too, but even if it is always more or less active, my visit have maddeningly always coincided with particularly quiet periods. It isn't such a quiet period now, and yesterday it seemed like Rifugio Sapienza, where all my visits had started, and even the cable car to the upslopes, would have to go.   The lava has seemingly stopped this night, and I happened across this incredible  urlLink gallery  of photos. It's really a pity that the larger versions have been reduced for easy loading to the point of losing much of their magic. The best way to admire them is en masse, even if at thumbnail size.

       Impunity for the powerful   The Guardian has  urlLink an impeccable article  on Androtti's conviction. Besides being informative and correct (though I wonder if people can follow the dark convolutions of Italian history through its most terrible turns) it ends with the ominous note everybody has been pointing out to me these last few days:  Paradoxically, the fate of a man who always emphasised his faith in the justice system is likely to be used by Mr Berlusconi and his allies to mount a renewed assault on the judiciary, for the rules and traditions of which the present prime minister has scant regard. The result could be a reduction in the autonomy of the magistrates and a return to the impunity of the powerful: the principle that characterised, perhaps more than any other, the Andreotti years that have just been condemned.

       "To think badly is sinful...   ... but you're often right" is probably the most famous of the celebrated witty utterances of Giulio Andreotti, sith times Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, affectionately known by friends and enemies together as "The Devil",  urlLink sentenced yesterday  to 24 years for commissioning a murder.   I was driving towards a cinema yesterday (to see the absolutely crappy K-19, a grievious disappointment) when my mobile rang to the tune of The Simpson - my partner Emiliano calling. I stopped and answered.   "They found Andreotti guilty!" he screamed at me.  "They  what ?" "He was found guilty of murdering Pecorelli!" "You kidding?" "No!" "You know... " I said after a brief pause, "I was almost coming to think he was really innocent."   Yes. Giulio Andreotti, the wilyest Italian politician, one of the few with a sense of humor, one of the few of total personal honesty - he never got rich - one of the many utterly devoid of a sense of public morality. Is he really guilty?  Who knows. People who know him swear on his personal integrity. A lot of them also admit to his certain political responsability for a lot of the ills that befell Italy in the last fifty years, including the Mafia. He may have ordered to have Pecorelli killed. He may simply have expressed a wish, knowing that the wish would have been met. Or he may be guilty simply because being an intelligent and anything but naive man, he should have anticipated the consequences of voicing a wish in the wrong ear.   I won't go into the convoluted an tormented history of his two trials (another one is at the appeal stage in Palermo - for Association with the Mafia). Believe it or not, I will praise the man.   Andreotti benefited from the Mafia. He did not create it and may not have used it. But he let it be. He knew - or should have known - that his men in Sicily were in connection or part of the Mafia families. He knew - or should have known - that the Mafia voted and had people vote for his party. He was a man of few scruples and probably believed it was for the ultimate good - defined by him, of course. But credit where it is due: when push came to shove and he could not ignore any longer what was going on, he fought it. That was why his good friend Salvo Lima was killed, because the Mafia felt betrayed by Andreotti.   And when he was brought to trial, he submitted to it. He did not stall. He did not cry that he was the victim of political persecution. He did not try to pass legislation that might get him off the hook. He went to his trial. He testified. Even horrified by the latest sentence, he has just said that he still has a deep respect for the Judiciary, and that the country needs such respect.   You'd think this is normal, obvious? It isn't. It takes guts. Everybody else is screaming that a politically motivated and insane judiciary must be brought to heel and subjected to the rule of the executive power. It would be easy for him to join in. He doesn't. Like Adriano Sofri, serving a 22-years sentence for a murder he most probably did not committ, he played fairly and accepted his sentence.  Maybe it's because he knows that no matter what, at 83 he cannot legally be actually sent behind bars. Maybe he does not care for exculpation on such tricky grounds.   Maybe in his old age he grew what we all would have denied he ever could possess: a public morality.   I don't know and I don't care if he was a murderer. As many have already said, in the eyes of history, politics and morality he certainly was guilty of even worse crimes. But for playing by the rules, I salute the man.

       They came and got them   The night before last, twenty people have been woken up by police and arrested. They were all involved in the "new-global" movement. One of them was Francesco Caruso, leader of the movement in Southern Italy, and such a far-out radical that other fringes of the movements left writings on the walls of Naples that said "Al prossimo G8 Caruso poliziotto", "At the next G8, Caruso will be a policeman". They have been charged of "subversive association" and "conspiracy to disturb the activity of the Government".   This immediately caused quite a stir, with people taking to the streets and a chorus of protests.  Since the arrest warrants had been signed by two prosecutors from Cosenza, the Right quite understandably argued that it was too easy to staunchly defend the Judiciary only when it prosecutes your political enemies.   There were also assorted expressions of relief and even somebody who said that this time the judges had got it right, because the charges were really serious now, not like those against a couple dozen policemen in Naples when there was merely cause to suspect they had tortured people in custody.   The arrested have not been charged with any  specific  crime. Media (the sort of media we have in Italy, you know) made a big deal out of the fact that they had been taken to Trani prison, where the last die-hard, stubbornly unrepentant Red Brigades members are serving out their sentences, and of the fact that the inquest had started from a leaflet found in a factory, claiming responsability of a terrorist bomb placed in Rome in the Institute for International Strategic Studies. But, as was noticed in the news on other channels, none of the arrested were charged with any link, however weak, with the bomb itself, or indeed, with any specific crime at all. The TG3 drew a parallel with the April 7th investigation, the one who landed lots of radical left intellectuals like Toni Negri (and incidentally, the founder of my own Amnesty International Group) in jail. But back then, they noticed, the 7th April people were charged with a sort of intellectual affinity with terrorism, but also with complicity in specific, and very serious, crimes.   Why am I telling you all this? (And why do I keep writing these monsters blog entries, that always aim at telling a small short story and end up recapitulating the universe? That's not what a blog is for, is it?)  Well, first of all, despite all of Italy apparently being on the move about this, no demonstration is scheduled to happen in my city and I'm too lazy to move to Vicenza and Verona. So I do what I know how to do best: sit down and write. I'm somewhat lukewarm towards the new-global movement as a whole, but you know, first they came for them and I did nothing because I wasn't one of them...  But mostly I write because this is what happens when you have a Fascist Penal Code. Let it be a warning.   I'm not referring to Berlusconi's governament as Fascist, mind you. There are fascists in the governament but that's a different thing. No, I mean it literally. Our Penal Code - the Codice Rocco - dates back, not in its entirety but for big enough chunks, to 1930. Nobody really ever got around to uprooting its most unsavoury bits, possibly (as Andreotti once said, if you suspect the worst, you commit a sin, but you're often right) figuring that they could come in handy sooner or later, like the ones that describe and prosecute what are essentially political crimes, allowing people to be persecuted for their opinions. If it's against the Constitution? Er. Yes. But you know law. There are ways around it.   If anything, the Governament, in the person of the current incumbent of the Interior Ministry, Pisanu, is quite obviously as uneasy about this as the most vociferous exponents of the opposition. Because things have changed since Genova, when the then Minister made himself scarce and let Gianfranco Fini and other assorted ex-fascists handle things. It has changed since the then Minister was caught slagging the latest terrorism martyr ("a prick that was always whining that nobody was listening to him" - as he was, poor bastard, because despite threats and ominous signs that he had become a target his escort had been revoked) was sacked. No, the new Minister is somebody who apparently thinks that good public order means no blood, no beatings, no shootings, no torture.   Which translated in the incredible victory of good sense last week, at the European Social Forum, so let me backpedal a bit because this too is a story worth telling.   The European Social Forum held in Florence over last weekend was five intense days of meetings, workshops and seminars in which the new movement was aiming at gathering minds and coming up with ideas, common grounds, and maybe a line of political action. It was supposed to be a meeting ground for the several disparate and different souls of the movement - from the grassroot Catholicism of committed priests and parishoners, to the radical and even borderline violence of the "disobedients". This meant that the Disobendients were there as well as the monks.   It would begin with a demonstrative "action" of the said Disobedients at Camp Derby, a NATO base near Florence, and conclude with a big, no wait, we got the last numbers, great, no wait a moment there's others who've confirmed they're coming, a  huge  demonstration against the war.    Now this made a lot of people nervous. Everybody expected mayhem, wreckage and devastation. No, I tell a lie. Not everybody expected them - some feared them, some hoped for them, and some deep down dreaded them despite being firmly resolved not to believe anything untoward would happen.   I think the most genuinely worried were the Florentines themselves. Some Florentines, at least. Most of the shop-owners in the city center closed down in trembling anticipation. They were expecting the worst: the barbarians, bringing ruin.  In Florence! Treasure coffer of humanity! Most beautiful city in the world (Florentines are wonderful people, but humility is not one of their strongest points)!  Other Florentines, as they have done again and again in their long history, tried to take a positive approach. Thousands and thousands of them signed up to host some of the visitors in their homes. On TV we saw these beautiful rooms lined with books and tastefully furnished in modern starkness, and middle aged men and women with patrician features telling the interviewer: I mostly do it for my children, I want them to meet people from abroad and talk to them and I expect this will broaden their minds. And you could catch a tiny spark of worry in their eyes - but they still opened their homes. Booksellers, among them the owner of the oldest bookshop in Italy, stayed open. The mayor stood firm in saying that they welcomed the Forum.   The Governament wasn't so thrilled. If the thing went well, they would end up with a huge victory for the hated Left - the real thing, not the middle-of-the-road Center-Left - on their hands. If it went badly, they would have to go through the horrors of July 2001 in Genoa again. Berlusconi enjoys playing the Foreign Affairs Minister, but not if it means that people take him up on their kids being beaten by the police during those fun get-together abroad. So the ideal thing for him would be if this Florence business simply went away. With people crying that the treasures of art and culture in Florence could not be endangered, hints were dropped that maybe, well, they could just call the thing off? Or shift it somewhere else?  As I said, the mayor of Florence wasn't having any of this. Neither was the Governor of the province. Neither were the Forum organizers. The right-wing papers (among them the major Italian paper, Corriere della Sera, which has sort of been sidling up to the Right for months - people say because of a secret buy-out) started up a campaign to have the Forum called off. Then one voice rose up over the murmur - Oriana Fallaci's. Bear with me, I'm going off into a tangent.   Oriana Fallaci isn't completely unknown abroad. She lives in Manhattan and after September 11 published a long, er, what shall we call it? Screed? Which basically came down to "We have a superior culture - let's go and bomb those beasts into the Stone Age. And since they breed like rabbits, let's kick them out of our beautiful country and keep them out." It's been published in English too, under the title "The Rage and The Pride". Oriana Fallaci always wrote passionately, and when I was a child I loved her for it. I cried over her long article on the life and murder of her lover Panagulis, a Greek dissenter who had known jail and torture and had never knukled under. I devoured her books about Vietnam and the space race - she was a good journalist, and an outstanding writer. It took me graduating into adolescence to understand that she wasn't as good a thinker. That she was quicker to move you to tears than to make you think clearly. That if she was uncompromisingly honest in looking inside her and chronicling what went on in there, she wasn't as good in processing that information, or measuing it up to the rest of the real life going on outside.   Oriana Fallaci,a Florentine herself, called the Florentine up to arms. Pull yourself together, people! she cried. Resist! Show some dignity! Spit on this barbarian horde! Do as you did during the Nazi occupation - close your shops, close your houses, bar your windows - and hang a notice outside: Closed for mourning.   While the Rage and Pride thing had been met with a furor - horror on one side (mine, for example: I had soured on her, annoyed by her self-preocupation and the frankly embarassing clukiness of her latest books, but I was wounded by the frank racism of her  outpourings of hate and prejudice), and enthusiasm on the other - now the prevailing emotion was embarrassment. Florentines, which besides being humility-impaired are not great fans of other people telling them what they have to do either, quietly simmered. There even was some snickering in the corners. One very popular comedian, a woman gifted with an almost scary talent for turning into uncannily identical copies of the figures she caricatures, appeared during the Forum in Florence with a camouflage helmet and mimiked Oriana Fallaci's speech cruelly.   After long consideration, the Governament decided grudgingly to let the Forum happen, on the grounds that while it was possible that letting it go ahead might lead to disorders, forbidding it was  guaranteed  to do it.   The fateful days arrived. The Disobedients went to Camp Darby and shouted Yankees go home. The Yankees probably didn't appreciate, but went along doing their business and ignored them. The people met, and talked, and slept in neat rows on the pavement of the town's sport facilities, under polite handwritten notes that forbid smoking and drinking, or in the Florentine's homes, and visited the museums and galleries for free. The few restaurants and bars that kept open shop did great business, as did the bookshops - the movement is apparently made up of avid readers. The ones who had closed, and protected the windows with plywood, found the plywood (and the plywood alone) covered in sarcastic commentary: "Closed for selfishness", "Closed for short-sightedness".   The demonstration wasn't huge - it was enormous, at least 400,000 people but probably a lot more who couldn't even march but had to shuffle because the route was too short to accomodate all  who had arrived. Nothing got broken or soiled or ruined. While in Genoa people had sprinkled water on the sweltering crowd passing under their windows, here they passed from ground-floor windows uncountable plastic cups of hot tea and ham and cheese sandwiches and plastic dishes of spaghetti, and opened their toilets to a long string of polite demonstrators who had found no bar and restaurant to recieve them.   Oriana Fallaci, who was rumored to be in Florence in those days, was probably vastly disapponted. She did not take up the Forum's invitation to go and meet them - thus missing, I think, the chance of a lifetime. (And so did I - for reasons that I will, sooner or later, try to explain).   People came back close to tears of elation. It changed my life, they told us. It's like the '68, told us an older friend who had been there, but gone right this time.   After everything was over,and the booksellers were gloating, and the Florentines were relieved and elated and touched, and even the Governament was basking in the warm fuzzy feeling of it all and complimenting itself publicily for its success, one of the Forum organizers took up all the t-shirts that they had left - t-shirts with the "Another world is possible" slogan that had walked the streets of Genoa too, and been beaten bloody by the hysterical police - and brought them to the Questura, to be distributed among the police that had discreetly, and benignly, overseen it all. The same people who ended up behind plastic shields and tear-gas and batons in Genoa received thanks and a t-shirt with Another World Is Possible. Demostrators and police congratulated each other and shook hands.   Two days after that, those twenty people who had just come back from Florence full of warm fuzzy good feelings got  that early morning visit and ended up in jail.   Why? How? What for?  Yes, there were violence and devastation and wreckage in Genoa. Were they linked to it? No.   This that follows is the reconstruction that appeared on La Repubblica today, in an article by Giuseppe D'Avanzo.   The inquest was started by a special branch of the Carabinieri, one of the several Italian police forces. The Special Operations Grouping, Ros, became convinced that behind the riots in Naples (7th May 2001) and Genoa (21 July 2001) there wasn't simply the random violence of the casseurs, but a plot. They set about proving this, by monitoring conversations and emails. They found evidence. Just to give an idea of the quality of this evidence:  - Anna Curcio (one of the arrested) talks on the phone while going to Florence. "I'll be working for a project of collaborations with the indipendent radios that will work through a web site, www.radiogap.net." Gap, the prosecution will note: like the GAP, the subversive formation formed by Giangiacomo Feltrinelli! Clear indication of the knowledge of, and a willingess to exploit the memory of, Italian terrorists networks. These networks, please note, were active in the '70s.   - Francesco Cirillo, talking on the phone with somebody else: "We've got to be in Florence by the 6th, because the first action will be at Camp Derby, an American base near Florence." The somebody else doesn't seem to be too keen. "Aaah," he goes. Cirillo presses him: "It's some hundred chilometers from Florence... this base here... and so the first thing will happen there." Thing, the prosecutor underlines, significantly. "Thing". Obviously, they were planning some violence.   Now, with this sort of evidence, the ROS started to tour Italy in search of a compliant prosecutor. They sent the dossier - all 980 pages of it - to the judges in Genoa. Genoa sent it back, telling them that there was nothing useful in there. Undaunted, the ROS sent it to the judges in Turin. The Turin prosecutor's office said "No meat here, folks." The ROS then tried with Naples. The prosecutors in Naples said that there was nothing penally relevant there. Then ROS then hit on the Cosenza Procura. Bingo.   Because the beauty of it is that these kind of charges do not need actual evidence.   Let me stress this again. What I have said up to now may be intriguing and interesting for whoever cares for Italy however tangentially, but this has a wider relevance.   A charge of conspiracy to overthrow the established order does not need evidence of any actual crime. One does not need to prove that anything has been done to overthrow the established order. It is sufficient that the conspiracy  could  do it.   The Right is, then, primly (and gloatingly) reminding people that  they  were the ones that insisted the Judiciary is not politically motivated. Ah-ha, they said. Taste of your own medicine, eh?  The fact is, accusing somebody - not to name names, Silvio Berlusconi - of having cooked books, paid kickbacks, and even corrupeted judges to have controversial business deal go their way is a political act only if there are no grounds for the claim. Accusing somebody of plotting not to overthrow the State but to "conspire to obstruct the action of the Governament and the established economic order" is a political accusation  itself .   The fact that such crimes are still contemplated in the Italian Penal Code is alarming. The fact that they are intrinsically so subjectively applicable (there is no discretionality of penal action in Italy: prosecutors only can  decide if there is a crime, not wether to prosecute) is also alarming. The fact that other groups, openly out to overthrow the established order have never been prosecuted  for this fact alone  - not to name names, the Norther League, is actually quite heartening. So is the fact that no judge does take orders from the exectuive power, nor is appointend by it. There may be judges with dubious judgement in Italy, but the majority are actually quite sensible people - and if they can be manipulated, they at least can't be ordered about.   The fact that "preventive" laws like this have been proposed or adopted all over the world is, or should be, cause for thought.   My friend Massimo Riva helpfully sent me a form yesterday, which I may use to denounce myself to the Prosecutor Office in Cosenza. The form goes:   Self-denounce form for subversive elements  The undersigned,born in      on   and resident in              , declares to be guilty of: (tick off the appropriate box, multiple answers are allowed)  Political conspiracy by means of association with the purpose of:  [ ] obstruct the function of the Government (including: not voting for the parties currently governing Italy, protesting against the Pact for Italy, defending Article 18 of the Workers Statute. (An aggravating circumstance is the ownership of any Nanni Moretti movie on tape).  [ ] spread subversive propaganda (that is, saying any thing that has not been said, or has been denied, by the Prime Minister. (Asking for respect of a plurality of viewpoints in media is an aggravating circumstance.)  [ ] subvert the established economic order (including: to support fair trade, boycot multinational products. Not including: cooking books, export capitals abroad, fiscal evasion.)  Other crimes  [ ] attempted attack against Constitutional Institutions (including: asking for the respect of Article 11 of the Constitution, demanding a discipline of the conflict of interests. Not including: voting for absentee members of Parliament)  [ ] carrying means of aggression (including Swiss Army knives, tissue papers, sanitary tampons, kriptonite. Not including: batons, CS gas.)  [ ] instigation to disobey the laws of the State  including: consciousness objection to military expenses, disobedience of the Bossi-Fini law on immigrants, taking parts in anti-prohibitionist campaigns. Not included: tax evasion and illegal building pardons.)  Signed by [name] on the  [date].   Massimo supplied the email address and fax number of the Prosecutor Office. I'm in two minds about this. I mean, do I want to gamble on these guys' sense of humor?

       Some were communists   This is by Giorgio Gaber, Italian singer, author, performer and, as this makes abundantly clear, ex-Communist. A lot of this is very Italian but I left it in because, well, because never mind if you don't get it. It explains a lot about Italy, really, including what Italians mean by "Communism". I do hope it falls under fair use. It's basically satire. I guess.   Emilia is the region in central Italy where the Communist Party has always won every election, with a long tradition of good administration.   Enrico Berliguer, a famously shy and honest, upright man, beloved by his supporter and respected by his adversaries, was to his premature death the leader of the Italian Communist Party.  Giulio Andreotti, now Senator For Life, was long a very influential figure in the Democratic Christian Party.  Piazza Fontana, Brescia, Bologna Station, Italicus, Ustica are all names associated with terrorist slaughters.  If I were ever a communist? Mah... in what sense? I mean... Some were communists because they had been born in Emilia. Some were communists because their grandad, their dad, their uncle... no, not their mum.  Some were communists because they saw a promise in Russia, a poem in China, and the Earthly Paradise in Communism. Some were communists because they felt lonely. Some were communists because their education had been too Catholic. Some were communists because cinema demanded it, theater demanded it, picture demanded it, literature demanded it... everybody demanded it. Some were communists because "History is on our side!" Some were communists because they had told them. Some were communists because they hadn't told them everything. Some were communists because earlier, much earlier, they had been fascists. Some were communists because they had understood how Russia went slowly but far. Some were communists because Berlinguer was a good man. Some were communists because Andreotti wasn't. Some were communists because they were rich but loved the people. Some were communists because they drank wine and went all soppy at fairs. Some were communists because they were so much of an atheist that they needed another God. Some were communists because they were so fascinated by workers that they wanted to be like them. Some were communists because they were sick to death of being workers. Some were communists because they wanted a rise. Some were communists because the borguesois, the proletariat, class struggle, easy, no? Some were communists because not today, not tomorrow, but the other day there'll certainly come the Revolution. Some were communists because Marx, Lenin, Mao Tse Tung! Some were communists because to get their fathers mad. Some were communists because they only ever watched RAI 3. Some were communists because of fashion, some for the principle of it, some out of frustration. Some were communists because they wanted everything statalized. Some were communists because they didn't know any State employee. Some were communists because they had mistaken "dialectic materialism" for "The Gospel according to Lenin". Some were communists because they were sure they had the working class behind them. Some were communists because they were more communist than everybody else. Some were communists because we had the Great Communist Party. Some were communists despite having the Great Communist Party. Some were communists because there was nothing better. Some were communists because we had the worst Socialist Party in Europe. Some were communists because the State, worse than here, only in Uganda. Some were communists because after forty years of slimy thieving governments they couldn't take any more. Some were communists because Piazza Fontana, Brescia, Bologna Station, Italicus, Ustica, etc., etc., etc. Some were communists because everybody who was Against was a communist. Some were communists because they could stand no more of that dirty thing we keep calling democracy. Some were communists because maybe they were something else entirely.  Some were communists because they dreamed of a freedom that was not Pax Americana. Some were communists because they could only conceive of being happy and free if everybody else was happy and free too.  Some were communists because the needed a drive towards something new, because they were ready to change each day, because they felt the need of a different morality, because maybe it was just a force, a drive, a flight, a dream, a desire to change things, to change life. Some were communists because with this force by their side everybody was something more than just themselves, they were like two people in one. On the one side the everyday personal drudgery and on the other the sense that one belonged to a race that wanted to take flight, for life to change, once and for all.  No. No regrets. Maybe back then many had opened their wings without being able to really fly, like hypothetical seagulls. And what now? Now too we feel like two people in one, on the one side the integrated body that obsequiously travels through its everyday squalid survival, and on the other the seagull, lacking now even the wish to fly, because the dream has shrunk.  Two miseries in one body, alone.

       The good American   I really wanted to write about something else today, and I may yet do, but this is something that I have to point people at - even if after such a long hiatus (hangs head in shame) I don't know who may notice at all.  When I'm about to give up the USA and everybody in it - and last elections were such an occasion -  reasoning that the people I trust and admire there are such a trifling minority that they're close to being negligible anyway, along comes Micheal Moore and makes me glad for the rational part of me that knows that's angry bullshit. I went to see  Bowling for Columbine , I laughed, I was sick, I heard grown men sniffling in the aisle across from me, and now I've read his interview in  The Guardian  and goshdamn if he didn't hit on close to everything I care about. I've been campaining to get all my anti-American friends go see it, because you can't help loving a nation that produces a guy that makes you laugh so much and so bitterly, even if it scares you silly.  The  urlLink second  part of the interview is probably even better than the  urlLink first , but both deserve a read.

      They appeared slowly, tiptoeing into the urban landscape in days of luminous cold, one by one. One of the first ones was  urlLink this . I don't remember when it was that I saw it first. Then two others blossomed together in my own street, tied to the omnipresent railings. I stopped and looked at them in something like recognition. Then it was  urlLink its  turn. From that day on I walked with my nose in the air, looking at them, feeling for the first time in the almost twenty years I've lived in this city not only affection but kinship.   Sometime later, at the beginning of January one freezing and most bright Sunday we went out to get drunk on the sharpness of the light, and to stamp on the iced pools, and we bought  urlLink one .   I don't know how many of them there are all told in this town. It seems there are a million of them in Italy, and Padua is one of the most flag-ridden town in Italy. Even the Town Hall has  urlLink one , exposed with the approval of one of the majority's councillors, an ex-helicopter pilot in Bosnia. They keep cropping up and sometimes you say, "Oh, look, that's a new one. That one wasn't there last time." They call out to each other and encourage each other. Some of them were taken down and paraded, often with the  urlLink ribbons  to tie them down still on, in the small but very colorful  urlLink demonstration  of the 4,000 Padua citizens who didn't go to Rome with the 40 coaches or the special trains.   They are silent. They are made from a thin, silky fabric, and when the wind blows mine up against the window it becomes a veil for a moment, but a dazzingly colorful one. They are difficult to pin down, especially if you don't have a railing, and often end up  urlLink furled up  against the sill. They flap merrily at the tiniest breeze. They ripple when pinned by the four corners to railings, they snap and furl and unfurl from the few flagpoles. Some houses here still have the flagpole stand on the balcony from whence you were, once upon a time (as my grandmother told me, showing me the corresponding Monarchist flag) obliged to fly the national flag on holidays. But few have the pole, and most just use a broom handle and  urlLink stick  it somewhere among the railings.   They  urlLink peek  from upper stories windows. They hang demurely over Padua's many  urlLink canals . They are trapped by rolling blinds, or hang by  urlLink clothspins  from clotheslines. I even spotted one, and stamped on the brake to jump down and take a shot, hanging inside the local  urlLink Apple  shop.   They are silent and cheerful. This winter, so unremarkably normal, so uncommonly clear, with its string of clear, bright, cold days, has been kind to them. This town, with its two or three stories houses, encourages them. The Italian soul is partial to them: they have, undeniably, a pretty design - much prettier, in fact, than the national flag.   I don't know what kind of people, inside those windows, fly them. It is tempting to imagine them close to me in feelings and convictions. I know that many of them are moved by religious conviction, this is very much a Catholic province, and the archbishop has encouraged their pacifism. But they are still close to me, in this vain act of minuscle courage, in standing up to be counted by all.  I don't know what their motives are or what their degree of pacifims is. I don't know if they ever mourned the loss of Mantegna's first fresco, bombed by mistake in the effort to get a Germans' depot, if they were ever touched by the bronze shield sent by King George with apologies. Or if they ever paused before the shelter, hit by a stray bomb, where among too many of Padua's citizen died the wife and child of the local Resistance commander. I don't know if they look at the sky in disquiet, in fear or in guilt because no torrent of fire and iron will fall on us from there. I don't know if they have read Love Thy Neighbour - that's difficult, because it's not translated - or Chomski, or maybe Joe Haldeman. They can't tell me because the flags are silent but for a very faint swish-swish, and their message simple.   There are lots of them. Lots and lots, and when I walk through my streets I walk in a silent, flapping, rippling, cheerful, peeking, furling, waving, snapping, thin and silky chorus of like-minded people.

         I got some extremely good news on Tuesday. I had one day to enjoy and then... well, then. Wednesday night I slept with the TV on, because I was seized by anxiety whenever I tried switching it off. And so, even without waking up fully, I knew when it happened. The next day I went around with a strange feeling of relief. It was happened: it was out of our hands. Then my ingrained optimism kicked in. Maybe, I thought, it will be like in the song: it's going to be a small war, and it won't be people fighting it, and when it's over nobody will remember it. Maybe it won't be so bad. Then I looked at the TV and remembered how much they lied last time around.  I have had along the years the fortune and privilege to be the Italian translator of some of the works urlLink Iain (M) Banks . He's one of my heroes. It has happened that his books have disappointed me a bit, but it is with a feeling of warm fuzziness that I read  urlLink this .

       urlLink 2003_03_01_markarkleiman_archive.html#90775005">One catch  (out of, let's fondly hope, many out there): Mark A.R. Kleiman says excellently a lot of the things I've tried to say confusingly and in fear of being deluged by outrage:  He rather callously adds, "It's a good bet that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed has felt some pain. And if that's the best chance of making him talk, it's OK by me."  No doubt it is.  The human capacity for courage in the face of pain felt by strangers is always pretty impressive, and fear and hatred can make that capacity virtually boundless. Taylor disapproves of "actual torture," for example breaking bones or tearing out fingernails, but even then makes a reservation for what he calls "extreme circumstances."  We faced truly extreme circumstances in 1861, and again in 1941, and again until 1989.  We do not face them now.  The threat of terrorism is a real threat, but it is not a threat of such gravity that it forces us to chip away at the Constitution to preserve the Constitution itself.  The terrorists can't conquer us or overthrow our government. The worst they can do is kill some of us, and we're all going to die some day anyhow.  Lest someone attribute to me the same sort of callousness of which I accuse Taylor, let me bring this down to a personal level.  About 3000 people died on 9-11, out of 300 million Americans.  If the next attack were as successful, and its risks were spread evenly over the population, each of us would face a risk of 1 in 100,000 of dying in that attack.  (If the risks of ordinary homicide and of automobile accidents were evenly spread, each of us would have about 1 chance in 15,000 of being murdered this year and about 1 chance in 7500 of being killed by a car.)  Imagine, then, that torturing the next al-Qaeda suspect has one chance in ten of preventing a disaster that great, and thus one chance in a million of saving you, personally, from being killed by that terrorist act.  Would you choose to be a citizen of a country that practices torture to avoid one chance in a million of dying suddenly?  I wouldn't.

      I have never, not even indirectly, met with torture. Not only I was born in a time and place, and to a class, where the danger to meet it was minimal. I have also, despite several years as an active member of Amnesty International, never met anybody who has faced it, something for which I am somewhat grateful, because I am not sure I would have been able to look at them and see them, as they deserve to be seen, as human beings, and not as survivors, burdened with the terrible knowledge of the extreme, saddled with the necessity of their witnessing, bounded in by their past, forever victims or martyrs.  I have then only and always met torture through the silent communication of the written word, which is no substitute for human experience, however piercing its papery scream.     This means that before embarking in any discussion of it, the standard disclaimers apply. I have, thanks to my good fortune, no direct knowledge of the matter. People who do often repeat it is not communicable. John Conroy, in his superb book  urlLink Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People: The Dynamics of Torture , (and  urlLink here's  the USA edition if you wish to buy it) says:   "I think it may be possible to set down on paper a description of al the horrors of torture in such a way that a multitude of survivors might nod and say, 'Yes, that adequately portrays the pain that I felt.' And yet the end product of such an exercise could be a book too painful for most people to read. Those who managed to reach the final page might find their eyes glazed over and their heart hardened.".   Jean Amery, who  was tortured by the Gestapo and lived to tell the tale (before taking his own life), reiterates often in his essay "On Torture" that the thing itself defies the limits of language. "The pain was what it was," he writes simply. "There is nothing else to add. The quality of sensation is neither comparable nor describable. It establishes the limits of the possibility of verbal communication. Whoever might make others appraised of their physical pain would be forced to provoke it, and so begin torturers themselves." (My translation from the Italian edition: it is probably  urlLink this  book).  People who have been tortured do bear witness but certainly not easily. They have to overcome shame, and reawakened pain and fear, and often the very real possibility of retaliation, and even the understandable and probably very healthy desire not to be forever defined by the experience. But more than anything, they have to overcome the unspeakableness of the experience. Description only goes so far. It?s easy to gross out people but harder to convey the horror of apparently smaller things. And knowing all this, for  me  to talk about these things often smacks me of an outrageous usurpation of somebody else?s witness, a violation of somebody else?s silence, even.  But the fact is, I have been obsessed by torture for a long time and I have come to accumulate a lot of knowledge, however partial, mediated, indirect and undeserved, about it. And when everybody and their dog is speaking about it, sometimes with cheerful callousness and fake courage (it?s very easy to generously steel oneself into giving consent for the torture of somebody else), I think I have probably, if not the right, then the duty to add my voice. That was what I joined Amnesty International for, after all. To wrestle with this particular demon.  It?s easy as I said to gross out people with torture. To mention the insertion of mice into vaginas; to speak of the young women whose hood was removed in front of a mirror with the warning "Take a look at your pretty face because this is the last time you?ll see it"; to talk of La Venda Sexy and La Escuela Mechanica and so on. Easy but pointless. Once you?ve waded through blood and excrement and death, all you?ve achieved is that people will squirm a bit and then talk about some bloodless, ?painless? forms of torture.   So I?ll tell you first off what was my hands-down worst moment in all my readings about torture. It doesn?t really concern torture at all. It concerns murder. But it makes the point.  Not many years ago I read the book-long confession to journalist Horacio Verbitsky of Roberto Scilingo ( urlLink  ,  urlLink and USA edition , also a book to buy and by damn read before granting cavalierly permission torture one's favorite enemies), one of those rarest of things, a repented torturer. Scilingo was in the  Argentinian army, and he ended up involved in the dirty war Argentina waged on pretty much a whole generation of bright, intelligent, idealistic and in the vast majority of cases totally innocent kids. This is a touchy subject for me for several reasons, one of which is that I am only a little younger than those dead kids, and living in a different if similar country, but in all other things very much like them. A lot of them were even - as many Argentinian are - Italian (Italian nationals, I mean, with Italian passport, not descendants of Italians).   Now the book?s title is ?The Flight?. Because what bugged Scilingo, who never  took a hands-on part in the actual torture (he managed the pool of cars used for the kidnappings) was that on a couple of occasions he had been embarked on one of the planes employed by the Argentinian military to dispose of prisoners who had outlived their usefulness. The prisoners, all of them ?desaparecidos?, disappeared, were told that they would be transferred to a proper prison, which meant that they would reappear to the world and their families. They were told they would be given some vaccination shots, actually a narcotics injection. Then, once unconscious, they were stripped and put on a cargo plane. Once the plane was over the ocean, they would be thrown out a hatch, alive.   Now this may gross you, it did gross me, but I have long known all of this and I could read it with nothing but a grim feeling of deja vu. What Scilingo adds then really makes me mad. Along the people charged with the stripping and throwing, he says, there were on the planes also the pilots, obviously, and a doctor. The doctor had the task of injecting the prisoners with another dose of narcotics (which did not prevent some of them from waking up, apparently) to keep them safely under. Then, Scilingo says, the doctor would go into the cockpit and close and latch the cockpit door.   Because of the Hippocratic Oath, you know, Scilingo says.  There. In all my years of reading about torture nothing, no unspeakable act, no gross physical violation has ever upset and revolted me just as much as this rationale. Because of the Hippocratic Oath.  I?m not here to say that hypocrisy is worse than actual responsibility. I?m here to say that hypocrisy does not get you out of responsibility. I?m telling you that hypocrisy is what allows torture  urlLink to happen , and  urlLink to happen again , and to happen now, in this very moment.  It?s too easy to get out of confronting torture, you know. It?s too easy to redefine parts of it as not-torture. It?s too easy to find special cases, special circumstances, special classes of people who are not exempted, who are not deserving of the same standards we would apply to our precious physical and psychological integrity. It?s too easy to redraw ourselves in the shape of the good guys, not matter what we do. John Conroy says ?Torture has long been employed by well-meaning, even reasonable people, armed with the sincere belief that they are preserving  civilization as they know it.?   It?s easy to find a way to excuse or even praise torture. People at this point usually ask pointedly if the noble soul ready to sanction the use of torture is ready to do it personally. I won?t. I?ll ask if anybody can imagine a scenario in which it would be right and just to  be  tortured.   And now the time has come to tell why torture is bad, wrong, and evil.  Though.  Allow me to get personal for a moment. I have already said that I am obsessed by torture. I?ll leave off the coyness for a moment and talk about personal matters - I write. I write pulpy space operas which I believe have some merit despite having remained unpublished for now, and mostly I write about torture. And I don?t really feel that I am entitled, but somehow I can?t avoid it. Because I am obsessed, as I say. I often wonder why, since I never have been tortured, never met anybody who was, never encountered the thing in real life in all my born days. And I do feel, kind words notwithstanding, that I am trespassing on very touchy ground, on an experience of a seriousness that should not be mixed with space opera.   I am not alone in feeling this, well, this fascination. With some friends and colleagues and the sponsorship of the Italian section of AI I have helped organize a contest for an SF short story that centers around a human rights theme. The first time around, we mostly got stories that had a lot more to do with urban legends and media scares than with any real-world concern, let alone one that had anything to do with human rights. So we decided to give a nudge to the aspiring writers and encouraged them to write about torture.   This turned out to be a very bad idea. What we hadn?t realized, being people who had all read plenty of accounts of real torture, who had a clear idea that it was a real-life fact that involved real-life people, was that people had fantasies about it. And they were, how shall I put it?, unsavoury fantasies.  It?s unpleasant to say, but torture fascinates people who, like me, have never met it, as it were, in the flesh. This obviously revolts and angers those who have - one of my colleagues on the contest jury panel, who has several friends among the survivors of torture, was quite upset at some of the things we received. But it?s true none the less.   I have several possible explanations for this fascination. One is that it?s a defence mechanism. Fantasising about the ultimate evil is a way to control it. One is that all things extreme fascinate us, in their excessiveness itself. One is, of course, that torture represents the ultimate control, the nearest one can come to omnipotence. And this fascinates us.  People in blogdom have been discussing the practicalities of torture, whether it works or not. I think the best answer I found in Salon, long ago, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11:  urlLink "Lessons on how to fight terror", by Andrew Brown   Torture is the crack cocaine of anti-terrorism because, for a while, it works. The terrorists will certainly use it. But everyone tries it. The Brits did it in Northern Ireland, the Israelis use it on the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority uses it on Palestinians too. The French, in their Algerian war against terrorism in the 1950s, turned it into an instrument of policy. But the price is higher than a democracy can pay. Either the people who have to do the torture are sickened, and spread their disillusion throughout society (this is what happened in France); or they are not sickened. They come to enjoy it; and then you have lost the values that you are fighting for. Either way, after a time, it stops working. The Russians in Chechnya can torture all they like. They still can't win the war there.   That?s all true and more than worthy of mention, but I think beside the point. People who have read a bit about how torture is used in the world (and let?s bear in mind that torture  is  used in this world, right now as we speak, for real, on real flesh-and-blood people like me and you, reader; that Mohammed al Kahlid  is  being tortured right now, as we write, or at any rate will have been, whatever we say about it, whether we are for or against it, no matter what we think or feel or argue or any permission we give or withhold. The matter is simply not in our hands, not for us to decide) will know that gathering information is really not the point. Torture works, yes, and the information it provides is often useless, yes; and often it is not, but lead to an escalation in brutality that landed us where we are right now. But that?s not the point.   People are not tortured to gather information. They are tortured as a means of controlling other people. Of putting the pressure on future prisoners, and their friends, and their supporters. They are a means of terrorizing a whole population, in the (often, at that, mistaken) belief that a terror-stricken people will not give flak. Torture is not about information, and it?s not about pain, which is why arguing that there are ?painless? forms of torture is placing one?s head under a thick covering of sand (?painless? torture, like sleep deprivation, exposure to white noise, disorientation, and so on, has wrecked people for life. There are survivors of the ?five techniques? used in Northern Ireland, and of course decreed ?not torture? by a tribunal, that are still suffering from the experience now, thirty years after the fact.). Torture is about control. Torture is the ultimate, most extreme form of control.   "With the first hit" Jean Amery says, "the prisoner realizes to be lost to itself: it contains therefore in itself all that is to come. After the first hit, torture and death in a cell - events of which the prisoner might have known, but without this knowledge possessing a real actuality - are anticipated as real possibilites, if not certainities. They are allowed to punch me in the face, realizes the victim with confused surprise, and with equally confused certainity he deduces: they will do to me what they will. Outside nobody knows and can do anything for me. Whoever may want to rescue me, a wife, a mother, a brother or a friend, could never reach me here."   And again:  "The most important element of the trust in the world yet, and the only one relevant to my argument, is the certainty that the other, on the strength of written and unwritten social contract, will respect me, or more precisely, he will respect my physical and therefore metaphysical substance. The boundaries of my body are the boundaries of my Self. My skin surface protects me from the outside world: if I am to trust, I must feel on my skin only what I  want  to feel.  "With the first hit, then, such trust in the world collapses. The other, against whom I put myself in the world and with whom I can only be as long as he respects the boundary of my skin, hitting me imposes his physicality on me. He comes upon me and thus annihilates me. [...] When  there is no hope of succor against physical abuse, it becomes forever a form of annihilation of one's existence."  Amery argues that torture is so characteristic of Nazism that it becomes its one defining fact. I am afraid, and saddened, that if he is right we must broaden the definition of Nazism too much. I do believe that it is a constant characteristic of fascism, inasmuch as fascism is an apsiration to total control of all individuals. Torture certainly does that: it imposes its reality on anybody who encouters it, it crushes and violates them. It is the ultimate imposition, the final form of control. You may not break all the victims of torture - though they tell me it happens with such high degree of success that one may discount the possibility of resisting it - but when you're impotent against their values, actions, networks, culture, you can at least without doubt or impediment  hurt  them.   And this is, I think, why people have been clamouring for it. Not because it works, because other things work much better in the short (good traditional police work) and the long (establishing a better way of co-inhabiting the planet) run. It?s because of the hunger, the need, the pathological desire for control.   I said pathological but I know that?s not the right word. Maybe ?futile? would be a better word. Or ?desperate?. I don?t think that pining for total control, for perfect safety, is wrong. I just think that it is a desire that everybody has to admit, at one point in life, is destined to remain frustrated. Total surety, total control of our environment would be a neat thing: it is just not possible. This, alas, goes for terrorism as well.  I don?t want to sound callous, because I?m not. I have lived through terrorism. I think the risks have to be minimized as much as possible. I think all the strategies for minimizing such risks (for example, try to talk ?friendly? regimes out of  urlLink radicalizing their opposition by means of torturing its members ) are to be pursued. But when all?s said and done, there?ll always be the idiots, the death-wish fanatics, the crazy, the evil. And we live in a society where a few people can do a lot of damage with mundane means. It doesn?t take advanced technology, or a great organization. A single madman with enough dynamite, or a long range rifle, can pull it off.    urlLink Jim Henley among other worthy things  (that should be read) has quoted Kevin Maroney saying:   "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."   --General Carlo Alberto Della Chiesa, head of the investigation into the kidnapping (later murder) of Prime Minister Aldo Moro, 1978   This has moved me and shaken me. Dalla Chiesa was no bleeding heart liberal. During a prison riot he sent the troops in and quenched it at the cost of several lives, including those of five hostages. But he was also, above all else, a faithful servant of the State. He knew what the country he served and revered was all about. And he did defeat terrorism, or at least the part of it that wasn't fueled, organized and defended by shady parts of the State itself.   But we still get terror. We still lose people to abysmally idiotic  fighters .   Americans have obviously had a different experience of terrorims than we - Italians, Spanish, British - have had. The body count was higher (though not by orders of magnitude) but more importantly it happened suddenly, with no warning and with a terrifying magnitude. The rest of us, we all had the slow escalation of terror to get used to it. (And, Dalla Chiese notwithstanding, we all had our moments of weakness, when torture looked a good idea). But the sad fact, common to all situations were terrorism takes roots, is that there is no guarantee of safety. Torture offers no guarantee (and several tactical disadvantages). Praying offers no guarantee. The common will of the people offers no guarantee. The sad fact is, you can reduce the body count, you can minimize the risk, but "defeating terrorism" does not mean that it will be totally obliterated and that complete and serene safety will ensue for ever and ever. It will only mean that it will happen seldom, and few people will be killed. That's the best that can be done until the nature of this world changes.  We do not have control of this world, however mighty or righteous we are. Total safety, complete surety, is not of this world. Invoking torture is a panic response, if not the totalitarian desire to substitute Orwell's repressive boot for the lost feeling of safety. The search for closure and vengeance, that goes with terror and weakness. It may make people feel better - because, face it, torture is a great source of satisfaction when it happens out of sight, to your chosen enemies - but will not guarantee total safety.   What it will guarantee, is fascism.

      I don't read too many blogs because I'm afraid of stumbling on something so sick and so evil that it will physically hurt me. But when I do stumble upon it, I have to point it out. This is it.  urlLink This  is as evil and as sick as you can be:  "I don't approve of ever torturing American citizens, who are of course protected by the Constitution.  But so long as we're at war, I think there are limited circumstances -- the "ticking bomb" scenario outlined by Dershowitz, for example -- where the torturing of foreign national combatants hellbent on destroying us can be justified."  Do I have to explain my disgust? I hope not. Well, maybe. I understand people who consider torture. I think they're wrong, but I do think they have sort of a point, that has to be discussed. (It has to be discussed. I have long meant to do it, and collected links and thoughts about it. But it needs time and tranquillity that at the moment I do not have. I will come back to it.)   But people who  do  grasp that torture is wrong, if applied to "real human beings" (i.e. citizens of the United States of America), and are still willing to see it done to the others... well, they are the face of evil.   There are people I respect who believe that patriotism is a good thing. Of course they aren't thinking about this kind of thing when they think about patriotism. Me, I don't believe patriotism is a good thing, because  too often it is all about the above.  Update on previous post. The author has seen fit to tell me that his point is legal and not moral. Well, sir, I did read the whole post. You do not seem to have understood that my point is moral, and not legal. You seem to also think that legality begins and ends with the American Constitution, and that international treaties, conventions or any other form of legislation banning the use of torture, like the International Declaration of Human Rights, which I believe the USA is signatory to, have no value whatsoever.  I don't know what kind of person you are. You may be a good and decent person, but then so probably are many torturers. Your position  disgusts me and sickens me from, yes, a moral point of view.  You also, I think, did not understand that I am not, myself, a citizen of the USA. You will probably understand, bearing this in mind, just why I found your post so evil and so immensely offensive.

      Last March, on the first day of spring, two things happened, one good and one bad. I got a phone call from Neile Graham, Clarion West administrator, to tell me that I was being invited to Clarion West 2003, and the war started.  I have to admit that I became a coward. I needed a visa for the US to be able to attend Clarion, and I knew there was no way I could talk about the war and not say things that could, concievably, no please the current administration. I thought it was mostly paranoia on my part, or at least exaggeration - and I was a bit spooked by the number of Americans who told me flatly, and in apparent all seriousness "no it isn't."  Anyway, cowardice went to keep company to laziness and the general sense of shame I felt, and the feeling the keeping the world appraised to what went on in Italy was both an Herculean task (they did too many, and too bloody outrageous things every day) and of dubious utility and impact.   I was also, as I recognized afterwards, in the first stages of the worst depressive episode of my life, that got seriously under way after Clarion and incapacitated me for most of last winter.   At any rate, I'm out of that now and though I still wish to travel to the US, it's no longer a matter of life and death, and things have been happening that I'd like to blog about. So here I am.

       1. Unshakable beliefs   The thing about America and torture and the whole bloody mess that Iraq has become, in Europe, is that nobody is surprised. A few die-hard americanophiles are hurt, but in general, the revelation that Americans have been torturing people out of need or pleasure isn't very shocking news to Europeans.   Actually, what I have seen discussed with disquieting frequency on mailing lists and newsgroups, is the possibility that the Nick Berg beheading footage were fake. The theory bandied about is that Nick Berg has actually been beheaded by Americans in Abu Grahib. This completely wacky theory - together with the ones that the Twin Towers attack was really the doing of some shady American agency - is actually considered by intelligent and educated people. It is based on so much pure bollocks that I am actually at a loss as how to counter it: the "evidence" is based on things like a fuzzy blob being likened to another fuzzy blob in the photos of Abu Grahib as proof that there is, in the Nick Berg video, a "typical American Forces beret". Another "proof" is that the white plastic garden chair Nick Berg was seated on look an awful lot like the white plastic garden chairs seen in the Abu Grahib photos... and in my own lawn, I might add.   What this latest conspiracy theory shows, disquietingly and, for me, maddeningly, is that people here are prepared to believe the most atrocious things on the flimsiest evidence, as long as they indict America of some Bad Stuff. Trying to counter the wackiest examples by pointing out that there is, actually, quite a lot of Bad Stuff that's historically attested and it should perhaps be wisest to base one's assessment of a country on that (including the fact that it was brought to light by, lookie here, other Americans) is useless.   The sad fact is that people are prepared to believe wacky theories because they hate the USA. They hold unshakable beliefs about it that no mere fact can dislodge. The terrifying but perhaps not surprising thing is that many of these "facts" are no more or less than buying the neocon or right-wing version of something. Example - many Europeans believe that the war on Iraq has its cause in the Twin Towers attack. They then proceed to point out that 5,000 civilian deaths are bad enough, without adding some several thousands civilian deaths in Afghanistan or Iraq on top of them. No amount of evidence can convince them that the war on Iraq was planned long before 9/11. This is not surprising because Europeans, especially those without a good linguistic skill, do not read American or English blogs and news, and have been missing out on lots of clues consequently.   For much the same reasons, Europeans believe that Americans are far more right-wing than they are, and that they are far more ignorant and less educated than Europeans. They attribute to the Americans in general a total lack of subtlety and political savvy, and no amount of pointing out exceptions can convince them. They will listen to Chomsky and Vidal, or have seen Michael Moore's documentaries, but they come out of such contact with the American liberal thought with the unshakable conviction that it's an isolated minority. They never pause to think that liberal, subtle, educated thought is a minority position in pretty much the whole world - and this is particularly puzzling in my compatriots, who have, after all, witnessed the landslide electoral victory of such a champion of educated political subtlety as Silvio Berlusconi (who last week attributed the attack on the Twin Towers to his personal obsession - the "communists").   Since it's not a problem for conspiracy theorists to believe mutually contradictory things, Europeans - and I mean particular individual Europeans I know - are fully ready to believe that Americans are ignorant clumsy idiots  and  that there are infinitely wily American agencies that will do things like bring down that bastion of anti-establishment thought, the Cantor-Fitzgerald offices, in pursuing their shady ends.   Why am I ranting about this in English?  I guess I have some sort of confession to make.    2. Confession   I have been one of the people irrationally irked by America. I mean, being very fluent in English and having lots of friends in the blogosphere, as well as having had a few selected and much loved American friends, I have always been aware that the popular picture was, to be kind, skewed. And I used to become pretty incensed at people having a go at Americana in general and at the supposed general characteristics of the American people in particular.  I  could be scathing about Americans, but nobody else should dare.   But still, I was irrationally irked by the USA. I wasn't too anxious to go there, and the accent got on my nerves. I remember sitting in Schipol airport waiting for my flight to Washington, my second time in the USA, and being irritated by random snippets of accent drifting my way. Irrational as it is, I guess the continental discourse on the USA influenced me, no matter that I knew how ignorant and misinformed it was. This is the awesome power of prejudice, it gets you even if you know better.   It took me about two months to be assimilated. I can pinpoint the moment of complete assimilation when, around the beginning of November, I realized I had  ceased noticing American flags . This was a sort of scary moment. But maybe the first twinges of assimilation had come when I heard the third wave of Europeans make the same remarks to the Americans about the things that freaked them out. The Americans happening by at that particular moment were far more gracious about it than I felt like being. The third wave of Europeans - embodied, as it happened, by my soon to be ex partner - were unfairly subjected to my ire, seeing as I had said  just the same things  when I had first got there.    3. Things that freak Europeans out: flags   I don't know if Americans consciously notice them, I guess not. But Europeans do notice them - with a start. And it's a continuos starting amounting to Tourettic moments. They're bloody  everywhere . You can't turn your head without spotting one. And believe me, until you get used to them, it freaks you out.   It's very hard to explain exactly why. I mean, one could go on for a long time about nationalism being sort of associated with your neighbours coming over the border to hit you with big sticks since time immemorial, but that wouldn't convey the deep-seated reaction of your average European to a flag.   So I'll recount the following anecdote.   We were driving down from Seattle to San Francisco, spotting flags here and there and the occasional bellicose hand-written sign, which my soon to be ex partner would photograph. We stopped at one coffee shop in Eureka, which had all the trappings of an obviously wishy-washy bleedin-heart liberal establishment, complete with rainbow-colored kite and general post-hippy ambience. And a good enough mocha to induce even my soon to be ex partner - who could spot a less than completely orthodox espresso at forty paces - to admit that, seen as a chocolate with coffee in it and whipped cream on top, it wasn't half bad. Provided one didn't think of it as  coffee .  At one point my soon to be ex partner freezes, his gaze aimed past my shoulder, and stammers: "Wha-what is that?" I turn and read the large sticker that I had already noticed on the coffee-shop's glass door: fluidly waving star-and-stripes, fiercely-looking eagle, and the caption "Peace is Patriotic".  "It means they're left-wing," I supply.  "But-but-but." He looks at me with the air of somebody caught in a world-upturning case of being smacked between the eyes by cultural relativism. "But the flag!"  Lest somebody think that I'm being unfairly hard on my ex, I did my share of flag-boggling during my first weeks in the US, and was repeatedly ready to share such bogglement with any handy American. They were very gracious about them.    4. Things that freak Europeans out: tips   Because you mostly don't tip in Europe. Oh, well, you do in case of particularly outstanding service, but it's very, very rare. I guess lots of Europeans tourists don't tip out of perfect and innocent ignorance of the custom, and are therefore a lot less liked overseas than American tourists (who, probably, tip out of sheer force of habit and not knowing it's not required) are in Europe. If you're even marginally clued, they would have told you that tipping in America is required, because waiters and staff will depend on that to reach a decent wage. This means that every time you add in the tip, you're reminded that some poor bloke's making the rent depend in part on how generous you feel. It's not a welcome feeling. It's also inconvenient to calculate the right amount every time, partly because nobody gives you real rules about it. Is it 15%? 20%? Used to be 15% but now is 20? Leaving 20% will be too much? Leaving 15% will be too  little? What if you don't have the change? Will I be thought a miser? Clueless? Too generous?   Add to this the fact that tax is usually counted in the shown price in Europe, and every bill comes with a little nasty surprise and a moral problem for us. Every time we pay a bill, there's a little hint at the state of the working person in the US. It's not probably a fair picture - but disproportionately disquieting because it forces you to take part in what is, to us, a displeasingly arbitrary system.    4. Things that annoy and puzzle Europeans: money   The smallest annoyance, all right, but a curiously abiding one. Once you get over the flags, the tips, the taxes, you still have this itch. Why oh why in a country where so many things go out of their way to make your life easier - cars with automatic transmission, motels, round-the-clock seven-days-a-week shops, large friendly directions, cat's eyes in the middle of the road, and, well, friendly natives - why has the money to be so stubbornly difficult to tell apart? If cutting it different sizes is too much effort, would it be so difficult to catch on to that stroke of genius the rest of the world has had - printing each denomination a  different color ?   Pointing out that the greenback is part of the national identity doesn't cut much ice with people who just switched over to the, let's face it, rather drab euro. But as dubiously attractive as the euro banknotes are, at least they're easy to tell apart!  And if having money that's rigorously all the same is that important to the national sense of identity, how come the States mint their own distinctive quarters, eh?   5. Assimilation   It might have happened around the fourth of July. I was looking at the fireworks seated between two friends, and they were mumbling disgustedly at the whole nationalistic pomp and crassness. I said joyously that I was actually  enjoying  the whole nationalistic trip - hey, it was so quaintly American! They both - from their quite different backgrounds - looked at me in disgust, and shook their heads. Somebody in the back kept going "Yes! Yes! YES!" at every successive bang and shower of sparks, finally erupting in a positively climatic "GOD BLESS AMERICA!" that I suspect accompanied other climatic moments in his life. My two friends were still shaking their heads.  Or it might have been when I discovered Office Depot - a country that houses such a temple to stationery can't be all bad. Or maybe when I found out that the bookstore cat was more or less mandatory for most independent bookshops. Or when I saw the Employees' Rights placard in the already mentioned Eureka cafe. Or when I had to take the final leave from the last of my Clarion mates. Or crying over email in a San Francisco Starbucks, because email wasn't the same thing, and San Francisco was so windswept and mellow outside, all soft but neat whites and deep blues, and cheap sushi.   I'd always known Americans were uncommonly nice people, but I thought the ocean acted like a sort of filter, that only the best specimens came through. Well, admittedly, I met a very intensively filtered kind of American through Clarion - the best fandom had to offer. But I guess it was enough to counter prejudice. Somehow, even the accent sounds different.   So I was assimilated. I have reflected on that since I left. I would go back to the States if I could, despite the nasty government and the appalling working conditions, and even despite the frightening lack of protection from the misfortunes of your health. And the silly lookalike money. And despite what New York smells like in high summer. It's first and foremost because of the people, of course. And because Science Fiction is still alive and kicking there, and it doesn't kick you in the shins like it does in the UK - though there's no finer kick in the shins to be had, UK contingent, let me hastily add. But maybe it's because this strange, unclear, ultimately rather unsettling feeling that the US is more real than the rest of the world. I've been thinking about this, and I have found no other better way to phrase it. Put it down to cultural imperialism. Put it down to the world becoming globalized, and my country only supplying the shoes. Put it down to our imagination being colonized. Put it down to this being the cradle of the best and of the worst - mah. That was a  Canadian  saying that, after all.   I am left, sadly, with a lingering antipathy for my country. Maybe because it tries to be the US and keeps missing in embarrassing ways. I have never resented copying the US, on the contrary, I've always been very irked by those that leveled "americanism" like an offense at me. But I would have liked it to be copying like Sergio Leone used to copy - with love, and ultimately being himself. Instead we get faded carbon copies of the most unfashionable stragglers of the American Right wagon. They look worse than pathetic - they look unreal.

      One thing you can't say about Italians is that they lack style.  urlLink This  is the latest addition to the Highway Police car pool. Apparently Lamborghini made a present of the car to the police. One is none the less inclined to think of the state of research funding in Italy, but hey, we got style.

      I was reading the NYT and found  urlLink this article  which struck me for several reasons. The first is the cute way it lists the traditional means of torture, like pushing somebody's head under water and stopping short of drowning him, and then calls it "stopping short of torture". It does say that "defenders of the tecniques" are saying that, but it consistently uses "tecniques" throughout the article. I'm left wondering what do you have to do to qualify as "torture".   The second is this priceless little bit:    Concerns are mounting among C.I.A. officers about the potential consequences of their actions. "Some people involved in this have been concerned for quite a while that eventually there would be a new president, or the mood in the country would change, and they would be held accountable," one intelligence source said. "Now that's happening faster than anybody expected."

      I have finally - to the general relief of my two remaining readers no doubt - decided to change my template. I am afraid that to switch on the new Blogger service that lets me have comments and warns me via email when they come, I had to lose my old comments. That's bad, I know. But let's try to be forward thinking. Also, now I'll know when people comment on my blog.

      While I work I keep checking the news. Yesterday La Repubblica's website was "Amnesty [International] accuses: Blair knew".   Oh-ho. Amnesty makes the headlines. That's new.  That's new because in the few years I've been a member I've read press release after press release with facts and figures - some of them relating to Western countries - that completely overshadowed the things we've all seen these past few days.   Reactions?   None.   Because let's face it. It's not torture that shook the public opinion in the USA and elsewhere. It was known that the US Army used torture. Its own coroners were returning a verdict of murder - not manslaughter, murder - for dead inmates in Baghram jail. What shook up people was not torture. It was pictures in prime time.   Any way, we're making the news. I think that's a good thing. I mean, not that Amnesty is making the news - that people are recoiling in horror. It would have been better if they had paid attention before, but it's a good, good thing that now that they are paying attention, their reaction is of horror.   What this means is that in future, pictures will not be allowed to circulate so freely - it's already happening. This will mean that torture will be carried out with a minimum of caution. Don't take me as a pessimist if I say this: it's not a bad thing. One thing that's glaringly obvious from the pictures themselves, is that there was what Amnesty calls a climate of impunity. Impunity means that people doing that sort of thing are seldom punished and if they are, they are punished extremely lightly. It means that the message travels down the ranks - we're looking elsewhere, and if you have to "take the gloves off" to make prisoners talk, well, we'll be looking out the window. To the extent that you can take pictures in the serene knowledge that nothing will happen to you if they circulate. (I don't rule out the possibility that torture wasn't encouraged or suggested, or even ordered. I'm just going by the most generous interpreation here.)  Now, if I may be permitted to point at the silver lining, the climate of impunity is lessened. People are paying attention.   To be honest, I am inexpressibly glad that the uniform - or almost uniform - reaction to the pictures was horror. Nobody - or very few - said "well, but it's the only language those people understand". Or "it's war, innit?"  This is a good, good thing.

      Kathryn Cramer has a  urlLink post  about heroes: people who refused to torture or denounded or stopped torture once they knew about it. Which brought to my mind sections of  urlLink Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People , by John Conroy, a book I wish everybody would read, especially these days.   I googled a bit and found  urlLink this piece by Conroy himself . It seems to incorporate a lot of the best material from the book. It is dated 2000.   Highlights:    ... It takes no genius to see a pattern ... and that pattern is repeated throughout the world: torturers are rarely punished, and when they are, the punishment rarely corresponds to the severity of the crime.    [...]  Democracies and authoritarian regimes sometimes offer the same rationales for failing to prosecute torturers. The morale of the security forces, for example, is as sacred in a democracy as it is in an undemocratic regime. Putting soldiers or policemen on the witness stand is politically dangerous. They might, after all, name high-ranking officers or public officials who sanctioned the treatment.   Furthermore, it is often difficult to mount an effective prosecution. Torture usually occurs in a closed room without independent witnesses. Sometimes the victims have been blindfolded or they are dead, so although their in juries indicate they were tortured and it is not hard to determine what unit was responsible for their custody, it may be impossible to determine which man in particular attached the electrodes, performed the rape, the near drowning, or the severe beating. Without predetention medical examinations, it is often difficult to prove that a victim's injuries were sustained in custody.   A prosecutor's task is made more difficult by the fact that torturers are often decorated soldiers or policemen who have served their country in time of need, men who often represent popular belief: they were tough on crime, or they were saving the country from subversion or immorality. The victims, on the other hand, may hold political or religious beliefs not in favor in the larger society, or they may come from some lesser class that is viewed as a threat to the society at large gooks, niggers, Paddies, Arabs, Jews, criminals, agitators, heretics, labor organizers, stone throwers, flag wavers, singers of nationalist songs, terrorists, friends of terrorists, and so on.  [...]   The response of those societies is fairly predictable and can be charted in thematic, if not chronological, stages.  Consider, for example, the British reaction to the revelations that they were torturing the Northern Irish in 197I. The first stage of response was absolute and complete denial, accompanied by attacks on those who exposed the treatment.  [... spooky, eh?]    The second stage was to minimize the abuse. The government referred to it not as torture but as "interrogation in depth"  [ ... "abuse"]    A seventh component of a torturing bureaucracy is to put the blame on a few bad apples.  [...]  [And finally, a helpful, hopeful note:]   In his book The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence, Staub argues that helping is infectious, that helpful bystanders, if they are not devalued by the perpetrators and inactive bystanders, break the uniformity of views, chip away at widespread antagonism toward a particular group, affirm the humanity of the victims, call attention to values disregarded by perpetrators and passive bystanders, and make it clear that persecution can have consequences for the persecutor. Staub points out that the citizens of Le Chambon seemed to have a profound effect on the Vichy police charged with rounding up the Jews: anonymous callers, believed to be policemen, warned the local pastor of impending raids.   Staub argues that helpful bystanders can also inspire victims. Staub points out that during World War II, Belgians resisted the Third Reich's anti-Semitic orders, and Belgian Jews did more on their own behalf than Jews in other Nazi-dominated countries because they did not feel abandoned, helpless, and alone.  Go and read it all.

      Mostly, I don't know what to say. I think I said it all about a year ago, when I wrote my long post about torture. Back then, I was moved to outrage. I am not outraged now. I was in a state of continuos outrage all the time, because the news where there for people willing to listen to them. Do I believe it's just a few bad apples?  LOL.  A few bad apples don't take photos with great big smiles and trade them around. No, I don't believe in a few bad apples. I believe in what we in Amnesty International call "impunity". It's the thing that makes torture possibile. When it's done with the encouragement, sometimes consisting in just turning a blind eye on, of the authorities.   I will make a prediction. In a little while, if it's not happened already, somebody will start saying it's not so bad. Just a few pranks, innocent mocking, despicable, all right, but real torture is something else, right? It is not, after all, as if we fed people in an industrial shredder feet first, right? (No: just dumping them overboard offshore in the knowledge that they can't swim. Or dumping them off a moving vehicle. Or beating them up until they're dead and then traying to buy the family's silence.)   You just wait and see.

      In the summer of 2003 I went to  urlLink Clarion West . It was the best time of my life. In the winter of 2003 I had a severe depressive episode and went very close to taking my own life. In the spring of 2004 I began writing again.  My bout of depression, for several reasons, was by far the most serious Ive heard about - going into major depression is not usual after Clarion -  but my predicament was not unique. Most of us went through some kind or another of what my fellow Clarionite Gabe Morgan called Post-Clarion Stress Syndrome.  Clarion is an extremely stressful experience. I wasnt aware of it at the time, I was even a bit scornful about all these talks of how stressful, how hard, how taxing Clarion was. I had been under a not negligible amount of stress for the year and a half preceding Clarion, on account of my job (I was, perhaps will be again, a professional fiction translator)  something that contributed among other things to the gravity of my subsequent fall  and Clarion itself seemed, by comparison, loads of fun. I hadnt realized that just because youre having fun doesnt mean that you cant be under a lot of pressure. Having the time of your life  by itself  , not counting what happens when you have to go home, can be extremely hard.   But lets concentrate on what happened to me after I stopped having fun.   My position was, if not unique, peculiar among Clarionites because I was a foreigner (well, I still am, of course). English is not my native language, and I didnt reside in an English-speaking country. I come from a different culture, so along with all the rest, I was in for culture shock. Not at Clarion... when I got back. When I landed back in Milan and looked around, in the most scorching summer Italy has known so far, a shiver went through me. I felt like I was on an alien planet. If there was a bright and lively centre of the universe, I was in the place furthest from it. This was a large part of my Post-Clarion syndrome.  Another stress factor was the fact that for the six weeks of Clarion we had been spoiled, pampered brats. Our needs were, for our mums Leslie and Neile, of supreme importance. Our sleep was sacred (apart from the racket across the street, but thats another story). Ailments and discomforts were taken seriously. Conflicts were dealt with. Paperclips were provided. At the parties, we were the stars. At the readings, we were sitting in the first row. We got to stand up and be applauded.   Clarion is a hothouse, and rightly so. You are treated like the privileged guy you are, and its implied youre going to give back lots to the SF community, because the SF community gives you lots more than can be paid by your tuition fee.   Then the six weeks end. Reams of scrap paper are recycled. You leave. The others dissolve into a cloud of electrons. You go back home and youre nothing and no-one. Youve been to  what?   What is it, a kind of school? Did you win something? Its that thing about Star Trek, right?  Rapid wilting of hothouse flowers suddenly exposed to January snow.   This is all the more true if you live far from the fandom network. In large cities, especially cities like Seattle, Minneapolis, New York, where fandom is thriving and you may even have a Clarion mate practically next door, it is possible to resort to the network. But if youre in the sticks, all your achievements and pains are suddenly worth or a weight for you and you alone. I went back to Padua, Italy. A country where Science Fiction is basically dead and fantasy doesnt thrive either.   I would probably have been able to brave the slump, and the culture shock, quite well if it hadnt been for other factors. One is personal and particular but one is very Clarionite  I was one of my years Clarion divorces.   They tell me the Clarion breakup is often a result of a Clarion hookup. In my case it wasnt so. I wasnt married but I was certainly sure I was going to be in a short time. My partner had joined me at the end of Clarion and the plan was to tour the USA together. As soon as I saw him I knew that, no matter how much I loved him, our life together was over. Clarion changes you, and the rest of your life sometimes doesnt change accordingly. We went through the motion of a happy holiday anyway, were even happy together for the last time, then we came back home and he took a plane back to his home town and I havent seen him since.  The advice I would  almost  feel like giving people about the Clarion divorce is: dont. Dont take life-altering decisions in the aftermath of six weeks of intense stress, at a moment when you are high on exhilaration and exhaustion. Wait to go back to your normal life, to your routine. Settle down, get over the slump, get over the mourning for the separation and loss of leaving Clarion, and then decide.   But I wont give this advice in the end. After long internal debate I think that, sometimes, people need a push. Maybe I needed one, to get out of a relationship that wasnt bad enough to be broken up as it needed to be. Being in a moment of flux and crisis, having to face loss anyway, helped me take what was probably a wise decision that I would, otherwise, have delayed indefinitely.   But if you end up being a Clarion divorce, and if theres no compensating hookup, do expect to go through the wasteland. There is no skirting around it.   So now, a few words about going through the wasteland  a few words about depression.   Feeling heartbroken and bereft is not pathological. Especially if youve got a huge stressor to justify it, like divorce, or Clarion, or  both . But it can devolve into depression and depression has to be cured. Depression  can  be cured. The tell-tales are widely known but Ill recap them briefly:   feelings of sadness and dejection feelings of hopelessness, radical and unrelenting pessimism (this is probably the most important signal) feelings of worthlessness, guilt or inferiority loss of interest for activities or other things that used to give pleasure in the past loss of interest or inability to perform everyday tasks loss of sleep  or  increased sleep feeling always tired loss of libido suicidal thoughts or ideation, including masked suicidal thoughts or behaviour like reckless driving, dangerous behaviour, etc. loss of appetite  Almost everybody goes through some or all of these at some time or other in life, but if you experience most of these and they persist for more than two weeks, youre likely depressed. Now depression can lift of its own, but you dont want to wait for this, for several reasons. The first one is that nobody will award you any points for your stoicism, and there are good and efficient treatments for it; the second is that depression has quite a high mortality rate  that is, people who have it tend to kill themselves. Depression is a serious condition, a dangerous one. It is not a moral fault. It is not a character fault. Its an illness, its a way certain brains have of dealing with stress, its got nothing to do with how brave, strong, worthy or nice you are. If you develop it, its because your brain has taken a pathological path to deal with stress. Youve got to help it, just as youd help your body deal with diabetes with insulin, or deal with an infection with antibiotics.   In dealing with depression, you will not be alone, no matter how strong and clear the impression that you are will be. Something that must always be remembered is that depression skews your perceptions. You will have strong, crushing feelings that all is vain, all is ugly, all is hopeless, that nobody loves you, nobody cares for you, and that life isnt worth living. You may believe that you have lost the will or ability to write. And you will feel a soul-crushing loneliness. This is all an artefact of depression. You are not hopeless, you are not faulty, you are not alone.   Depression, as a friend told me, works like this: your brain has some feelings, generally of a very negative nature. It then searches for a reason to feel them. If it doesnt find any factual reasons, and the feelings persist, it seizes on inexistent or irrelevant facts and constructs a pathological but very convincing case out of them. It is very important not to lose sight of the fact that what seems very convincing under the influence of the illness is not necessarily true.   I have, for example, throughout my illness, been consistently helped by several people who have devoted time and attention to my condition, some of them my Clarion mates, some of them unrelated to Clarion. They have listened day in day out to my pain and fear, and never stinted on reassurance, reason, company, and love. They sent me cards and little gifts, they chatted with me, they emailed me, they phoned me, they showed up at my house to sleep overnight on the day I felt most dejected and close to the edge. This did help me  I probably would have killed myself if they hadnt been there  but throughout the episode my most crushing, painful feeling was of loneliness. I felt absolutely alone and bereft of hope. But, having been depressed in the past (and thanks to the generosity and patience of the above-mentioned people) I knew the feeling was just a feeling, and would disappear with the illness.   Clarion itself is a great resource in times of trouble. It is an incredibly bonding experience and there is not one, not one of my Clarion mates I did not miss, I did not feel close to, I did not love. Not even the ones I argued with passionately during Clarion (or indeed afterwards). This is a common experience and a resource that is there for most people who go through it.  My Clarion mates were probably the most decisive in helping me survive until I got better. Some people broke under the strain  two of the people I cared for and counted upon most ended up shoving me away. One probably did it believing it was good for me. The other did it because he couldnt take it any longer. This will happen to anybody going through a serious crisis; some people will stay and some wont. Some people will help and some wont be able to. It is useless and unfair to hold it against them: it is not an easy task.   The most important thing, and the one that is hard to believe, is that one day you will realize all of a sudden that a feeling of grace has taken hold of you again: that once you were lost, and now you are found. One day  that may come quicker  because of medication, therapy, help, or the natural lifting of the veil  you will realize that the dreadful loneliness was being far from yourself. That the reason nothing and nobody seemed sufficient company was because it was you yourself missing. Missing but not gone: and you will wake up one day and every piece will be there, and the disorder wont be chaos any longer, and you will spend a happy weekend all alone with your words, and you wont miss something vital any longer. And new words will come back. You will realize that even brief notes scribbled in notebook are not as bad, as useless as they seemed at the time you were writing them. You will go back to life. Even collecting rejection slips has its own perverse charm.   It gets better.  Really. It does.
