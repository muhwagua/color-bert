      Heya im back again. Just found out that my Physics lecturer is a nerdy looking boy. Heh. He's not that linen. And he sucks!  I need to pass up my 2nd assignment tomorrow. Damn, im in deep shit.  Anyway, there's nothing to do much. And unexpectedly, Jonathan Khee sent me a sms, and there were 3 missed calls before that. Well, i had dinner with Yasin and Hanvin at Meok. Three of us, hehe, all of us are doing Computer Science.  Finally, i got some friends who are in the same stream: Feeling happy.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, Kum Loong told me that James is such an arsehole. Well, i bet he is.  Looking for one night stand huh? Too bad, i'm aint your prey. Cause im too smart, besides that, you're not that type of guys that i look for as a boyfriend. Though he's rich but he's so short, but i bet my sisters would say that his genital must be damn short.  Anyway, i don't care. Maybe he got a sourgrape when he's in malaysia; well, he just couldn't get me, that's why he told K.L that he only looked for one night stand. For god's sake, the first day, he saw me. He fell in love with me on the first sight.  "Oh my god, you're so gorgeous!" Of course, but too bad, you're an arsehole who's born to be stupid.  I'm not playing with your feeling directly but indirectly.   Hmph, luckily i have these senses telling me that, James is not a good guy.  Oh well, Jonathan Khee..? Another prey of mine?  Hopefully, i'll love him...for god's sake  Please bring me an angel, if not, that would be Jeremy.

      Okay, i have no idea where to start, so i try to write as much as i can now. I feel so depressed and sad, tired and blistered. What's all about life? Hurting james? I dont know how much that i have hurt him but despite to hurt him more, i decided to tell him what's exactly in my mind. I just read Ivy's blogs, yeah, i bet she pity James as i have this weird thought that she likes James and rather want me to leave James alone. Yeah yeah, i bet you do like him, Ivy. So stop denying yourself!  Today's Tuesday, my apartment is still out of electricity...  Can you imagine that i've been sleeping without any light these two days? It's like a doomed day to me. Somehow, candles are essential for us. It's funny when i accidentally burnt my fingers. It's damn hot, and i just can't live without air-conditioner.  This is my first post. Stupid college's IT department set some new policies and for library use, they have banned some website addresses which they assumed as obscenity.  What a fuck is wrong with their heads?  Anyway, skip that shit. Miss Zoe just told me that University of Toledo offers Internship for Engineering majors, sounds delicious to me and damn it, i need to prepare everything within today. And now im still hanging around at this library writing my blog.  Well, this is my first post. Feeling great. I like writing anyway even though my english is damn bad.  Anyway, now im feeling tired. Missing Jason, reading his blogs makes me envy! He has so much fun for this summer holidays.  Oh yeah, Jonathan Khee. He's my monkey now. Thought he doesn't give a shit about me, but he does somehow... indirectly...  What a weirdo...

      There's a force keep pushing me away from you. . All i see from the past few years; our promises they were meant to be broken. . Pieces of you are shattered by teardrops of venus. . It's almost unreal when you reach out for me just to tell me that you love me. . you're bringing me down, down to the ground. .

      I want to be with him forever and ever and i'll be honest for the rest of my life. God knows why i want to be with him. God knows why i still want to be with him. Cause i'm not over you, and i won't get over you no matter how, no matter how bad it is and no matter what happens I just want to be with you even for a while or even for the rest of my life... I love you...

      Well, currently listening to Placebo's Without You I'm Nothing...  It seems like some of you might have crestfallen, or you've been forsaken because of love and u're lost in the relationship u have now.  All i feel is nothing.   "You're making me anxious again. You always do that starting 2 weeks from your period. Start acting weird and strange. Sigh. Well, when you do that you make me uncertain about you." A sms from J.Khee.  What am I supposed to say? I stunned for a while, feel a little pain at my chest.   Eventually, i wrote, "Likewise: I don't know what you are thinking now cause the way you treat me now is different since we came back from Iph...I know a lot more, but i keep them inside without letting you know." "Since you say that we're not compatible and etc, it doesn't even matter to me, so i guess u shouldn't concern with my thoughts. Whatever you think about me, let it be but whatever i do with you r true..."  Anyway, i got not much to say today. How many people out there still feeling lonely even they are in love...? Feeling insecure and confused? Feeling doubtful? All kind of thoughts would come and strike your mind for once; and you start to feel uneasy and etc. It matters how you control it and how you look at it.  As for me, i cried for a few hours when i read those ICQ messages that J.Khee sent to Ave; i know it's bad to do such thing, but in the end, i still doing the same thing. I cried for a while when he was sleeping next to me, eventually i accepted it and i calmed myself for a while. Spending a few nights with him were the greatest memories that i had when i was with him. Even though it's just a short-term relationship but it was enough for me.  For him, the excited feeling was gone after we were together, he told me honestly. Despite of hurting my feeling more and more, it's better for him to express his feeling to me, how he feels and etc so that when we break up eventually, it won't cause any impact to me.  Came back here is another way to forget about him, i feel calm, there's not much of pain. I'm glad that i'm back here, though the old memories and nightmares come back to haunt me every second...   Sitting down here, wondering; the dead feeling comes back not because of him, because of those memories which are stored in my mind eventually let loose and haunting me. It hurts and makes me cried.  I know it sucks, but i accepted whatever that has happened to me, all my rage my pain are led to numbness that i have right now.  My heart is bleeding like before but i know, time is a matter; hoping to get a new life somewhere. My dream is to break the lies; the despair that i have all this while.  It's pointless for you to hold back to the relationship that you know it won't work out.  So i give it away, i give it all away...

      In the dark, all u see is a hopeless dream... all u see is lie; all you believe is nothing, it's emptiness and loneliness You can't see your hands but your senses guide you and you need to crawl, scared you will hit something; u hear some voices that u assume they are the devil's calls... everything seems hopeless to you; and u hope and u pray for a light to lead you... so im afraid of the dark...  I'm getting used to it... even though i'm so afraid of it... waiting patiently even though i know it takes a long time... like sleeping for a long time conquer the fear, eventually become numb, then u hope for something to lead you...

      Well, today's "Hungry Ghost Festival." Uncles and Aunties came to our place to organize a ritual, well, shouldn't be called a ritual. Burning some incense and some papernotes; respect those descendants.  "Wow.. You look prettier now, did you dye your hair...? Look like an artist...? Look fairer.." Okay, aunties and cousins like to make some joke everytime when they see us [sisters and me]  "Yeah, i did.. Really...? Look nicer huh but my hair is still wavy and kind of dried...?" Hehe, greeted all of them before we had a conversation like usual; this is a manner we should learn.  "Nice hair, fits your face and personality, black is dull but anyway you look prettier with your hair though it's not sleek and straight... Look nice naturally..." Cousin, Yun, a big grin.  "Wow, why are you still so skinny....? You should put on weight and you will look definitely gorgeous...?" exclaimed both my aunties.  I was like, "Uh... skinny...? Not again...? I'm gaining more weight now, auntie...." "Being thin" is the topic that they always like to bring up; well, i know i look thin but at least I'm better than before; unlike before, i look like an ANOREXIC. Wtf?  "Auntie, my weight was 38kg before and now my weight is 42kg!" Gave them a wink.  "What?! 38kg? Oh my gosh... Well, you look fine somehow. All of your sisters are skinny, even your father.. hehehe.. Well, three of you hold different kind of beauty... bla bla bla.."  During this conversation, i made them laughed, you could hear they giggle and chuckle so loud; i'm a witty girl;i like to make jokes to make them laugh, want to see them happy; not because we are blood related; because i like to make them feel comfortable when they are at our place. :-)  Well, aunties and cousins: thanks for all these compliments, though; but sarcastically, they crap about my weight; always do, but I know they are just joking so i don't take their words seriously.  Sometimes, you may become a subject as an amusement of your families, peer, or even strangers. Keep in mind, don't get annoyed or angry easily on the 1st place; just take it easy; probably they are trying to mock you or maybe they are "advising" you in a teasing way for the sake of yours. Sometimes, those words might hurt your feeling or make you lose your dignity or hurt your pride + self esteem but think in a positive way; they might "motivate" you to be a better person.  Well, i make a point of view sometimes for all the words that my family or close friends say to me and i judge myself from every angle to find weaknesses in myself. Self-improvement is good... Ignore their words or listen to them. :-)  Suddenly, recalled whatever my cousin, Yun said about this thai-chinese guy, Teng. Both of us knew him when my family and her family went for a tour to Thailand. Yun was the one who had a crush on him the first place; hehe, she's always that flirtatious but eventually, Teng and I fell in love.... awww, it was the sweetest memory i had. Well, i was 15 years old that time and he was only 21 years old. Erm... *blushing* I guess he's probably 28 years old now; Introduction; Teng is a Thai who can speak fluent mandarin, he wears spectacle, fair, he looks neat all the time, humorous, mature and he's such a good looking hunk (well, a thai-chinese!); well everyone in the tour liked him... He was an assistant to a Tour Guide, Uncle David; seeking for working experience before he could become an official tour guide.   Well, it was really funny when, Yun said,"Do you still remember what you said at the airport?"  I stoned for a while and started to giggle and covered my mouth. Feeling embarrassed.  "You said that you would pay him a visit at Thailand when you're 30 years old... and you promised that..."  "Oh my, yeah i did, but not 30 years old, i mean when i'm 23 years old. It's been 7 years; he would probably get married or being a monk right now..."   "Well, actually i like Teng too, hehe though i'm only a primary school student... " Bee chuckled.  How did we fall in love...?  Well, Bee and I were sitting at the back row in the traveler’s bus. He was sitting just behind us; we became so close when we played some games together in the bus; for example; stone, scissors, hand and other tricky games... At night, it was extremely cold; hehe, he started to disturb me by pulling my hair, feeling annoyed and tried to catch his hand but failed. In the end, i caught him and in a sudden, he just held my hand tightly, tickled my palm and i was shocked... Oh my god, i still remembered that night; Bee was sleeping beside me; and he held my hand so tight and that's all. Well, i was freaking scared that my dad would see it and my sister, heh that bugger. My face was getting hot and i could hear my heartbeats beating fast. 15 minutes of silence, but eventually i felt relaxed and feeling deeply emotional; affectionate by the touch of his palm; I'm just like China in his hand. I didn't dare to tell my siblings about this and even my cousin about it because Yun liked him that time...   Only both of us knew ... we liked each other, well, we didn't hold hands whenever we went since i'm just 15 and he should know if he holds my hands, my dad would definitely kill him, just that night; holding hands, the warmth from his palm soothing me... The next 2 days before the last day, we just stared at each other; had no idea what we should do; just looking at each other lovingly and a bit awkward; he felt shy and me too. How sweet it was.  He adored my brother, David so much, carried my brother everywhere since my brother was only 6 years old. Everyone likes him so much and still remembers him, even now...  The day when we left Thailand, at the airport; departure; everyone started to weep; i just held my tears back from falling down my cheeks, so did he.. When we were ready for boarding; he cried, so did we; i saw his eyes were getting red and tears falling down... Even though i was very young that time, i knew this was impossible for us to continue our "relationship", though it was just a few days of being in love but it was enough for us, sweet, short and simple. I'm so lucky that he left me with a Photo, his address and a letter written "Pom Rak Khun." [I love you in Thai]   "Bye..." I showed him a hand sign where i learnt from a MTV; MTV is about this girl who has an accident and she becomes mute, the only way she can express her love and "I love you" to her boyfriend is to learn hand signs, i couldn't say a word of "I love you." since my dad was rushing us but i guess he knew what did it mean.  Oh well, i kept this feeling for him for two years or maybe more than that, til i reached 17... Knowing that this dream for us to get together again won't become true, just to pray that he's always safe, happy and healthy...   Okay, anyway, i miss him.. All of us miss him.. He always.. Has a place in the core of my heart..

      Okay, where should we start?  Jonathan Khee; He's cute and smart but he's such an arrogant boy and a sick brat. I'm sick though.  Hehe, mummy calls Jon.K a toyboy since he's younger than me. Hehe, anyway, he also admitted that i'm treated him like a boy... Ooooh, well, nope, i didn't; i treat him like a man.  He's such an androgyny, he looks prettier than me. I'm kinda jealous of his "look" esp his complexion, he got a pair of big eyes, of course, not as big as mine.  Anyway, our relationship has improved, a step forward, well, I spent a few nights with him, sleeping with him, kissing, cuddling, chit-chatting on the bed, intimacy and what else, play some bubbles games, downloaded the exe from Http://www.absolute.com Heh, now his score is more than mine. Grr...  Accidentally, i checked on those messages that he sent to his best-friend, Ave and some of them made me weep at night when he was sleeping next to me. They hurt so much; but funny when they only gave me a little tension after i accepted whatever is happening right now. Well, J.K said that he would go after any girls if i leave to USA end of December and i'm not the type of girls he wants to be with and etc. Well, i bet he will look for a better one than i am.  This game of love, all you need is to play safely. But things are getting out of my hands, cause my feeling... for him is getting stronger after we came back from his hometown. He treats differently since then, but still i feel insecure.   Come on, he can get any girls he likes like i can get any guys i want easily. But when i look at him, it's just like a mirror, reflecting my inner look and my personality. He's ... such an eccentric like i am but now he's so special to me..  Am i in love with him? I guess i do, a bit by bit. Wonder when will this bitter end?  That's why im running back home from him... without seeing him by my side; we'll get over it sooner....  Miow... i miss him...

      Hi, i'm  back again. It's been 5 months I did not update my blogspot.  Should I write about something that is out of my expectation here...?  I'm reading my past few blogs, yeah, I'm deeply in love with him now.  Everything is so clear and true.  There's so much things to say and write but there's only one thing is confirmed; he loves me too.  I feel loved and I'm in love with him until the day I die and my body decay but my memories shall remain...

      Well, i wanted to tell him about the good news and bad news; but i guess he won't answer my phone calls.  Who else is gonna share this happiness with me?  I wrote a short paragraph for description pattern; those three classmates of mine selected my paragprah and they thought mine would be eligible for reading. My lecturer gave me a compliement that i wrote an excellent paragraph, i was so embarrassed but feeling proud of myself. But when i was presenting my paragraph, i almost wanted to cry... After that, my lecturer gave me a feedback and said that my paragraph is touching.  Sigh, i hope he could read it besides blogging, but he doesn't know this site, sigh, what else i can do..? just to let him know what i wanted to tell him...
