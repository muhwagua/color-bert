       npcc day  it's the perfect day for our feeziks teacher ASP Chia to actually stand in front of the mike and string together more than one gramatically perfect sentence. of course, his "speech" paper must've made several trips across the english department for major overhauls... uh... i mean, touchups.   but the sight of 7 guys in npcc uniform sitting right in the rows in front of me... is irritating. like big black beetles that refuse to go away.

       calamity 1979  i had dinner today. outside. fish porridge. i mean eating fish porridge has a transcient feeling to me. like... caviar. or smoke--i haven't tried that though.   simon poh is going to try a maths class--chee's class in particular--at mavis. good luck, i say. "i'm going to conquer this row first." yuck.

       the essence of pain  three things happened after i failed my napfa 2.4km run for (approximately) the 823,513rd time: i went to play football with KS' brainy friends, then i hurt myself in the knee and pulled a hamstring (on the same leg). the fucking thing bleeds every time i bend my left knee. so now i type this mournfully in bed on my laptop.   and oh yes, the pain surges through and through; and the blood is merely a trail of its destruction. your disdain is my fuel; your pain is my cure; and for ever and ever dinosaurs shall rule the planet.

       personality disorders   urlLink BBC: personality 'improves with age'.  keeping in mind that lee s.h. and mr foo s.m. are the two best physics teachers on the planet (and also very retired, unfortunately), i think i see more, uh, "exceptions" in school than is the norm.   but you see, the heading of the entry is "personality disorders", and today's personality disorder goes to kenn--and seriously, there's nary a soul who can rival him in this area. today he sported an SCGS badge and snorted like a cow... all day. and what a time too--i'm reaping the first profits of a good venture (and if you allow a pun here, very foolproof!) by the end of the week. i decline details for the moment.

       meditation, science & statistics   urlLink Slashdot: Buddhists Really Are Happier  "...there seems to be scientific evidence for the idea that a regular program of a certain kind of meditative practice can have a positive effect on the brain."  there's nothing as good as a slashdot discussion to widen your religious horizons on a boring saturday afternoon. see coments  urlLink #601940 ,  urlLink #6017045 ,  urlLink #6015527 ,  urlLink  #6020291 ,  urlLink  #6018386 ,  urlLink  #6022104 ,  urlLink  #6014728 , and finally  urlLink  #6026027 . all short little snippets of wisdom by atheists, buddhists and observers. no gory scientific details. now, of course i respect your religious ideals. if your religion does not encourage you to go beyond, don't read. easy.   on the other hand, this orange juice i'm having... never mind.

       taking a bull by its horns  feh, today ruled: i think i couldn't do a quarter of my e maths paper; and i hope my scheming plans for sympathy marks for chinese composition will reap some dividends. now, you must understand that trying to get me to speak enough chinese to be of a comprehensible standard is like trying to get a duck to bark and malcolm to learn his social studies by tomorrow morning (not that i'm going to underestimate him here--in secondary school it's possible for one to get away with memorising whole textbooks and scoring A1s).   the plan is obvious: gain pity by so conciously & sincerely harping on your poor chinese (the pun comes next) written in that very same crappy chinese. and  that , i am confident enough to say, i can do better than anyone who dares talk about robert and raisins in the same sentence.   and of course, after half a year (or a year?) of not knowing that (for thankfully i don't own a nokia/whatever brand handphone) companies have practically cheated thousands of mobile users in singapore into buying 15-20 second RINGTONES for  two dollars apiece , any form of cheating is possible. there are gullible people abound. goodnight!

       space & time  it's quite an endearing scene (if you ask me) where you have a teenager inexperienced in this temporal world of ours overboldly preaching on the rights and rashly impugning the wrongs of the day. there's no such thing as an eternally wrong thing to do, as science, history and the theory of probability have shown and will show.   but you know if there were such a science the science studying adolescents is the most interesting one of all. it's like a house where Confusion is father and Contradiction is mother; and the children Dream, Infatuation, Senseless and Rebel, they link hands and sing winter songs by the fire. Grandma Wisdom, neglected & cold, she's the one at the corner, always in reach but never called upon.   ok i'm buzzing like a fridge. it's ingliss tomorrow, i hope i pass. bye.

       liberation  the exams are overrrrrrrrrrrrrr. for me that is. but anyway biology sucked my stupid thermometer. i had to sit there for 2 hours with T.T. staring at my paper like it was the kama sutra. or a really poorly done paper, of course. that's why the expression is "a glaring mistake". it just glares at T.T., and T.T. simply hates people glaring at him. & when you glare at your reflection in the mirror, all you do is wonder why that fellow looks so much more mean-looking than you do.   kw, jeremy & joseph are watching (or maybe it's over) a movie. i don't know what it's called, but probably the sequel to this octopus movie thing. matrix or something. yes. with their 5 million female companions. as you can expect, kw and joseph talk about females the entire day. and i... i can merely marvel at how they keep at it...

       to whoever it may concern  i appreciate your kindness for sending me (for the fifth million time) bill nye online greeting cards (and yes, four years ago bill nye was my saviour). but as they say too much of dessert leads to diabetes, and too many greeting cards... result in more trees getting chopped down. oh yes. that is not a lie.   and you don't have to poke fun at my lack of fitness... but i'm the only Mr Sik Hui School student to sport a tie every tuesday... just to display my wonderful yellow/green/orange stickers. yes sir. but i'm on my way to heaven. i think i might just negotiate with maya to lend me his holy grail and life of brian DVDs. i just NEVER NEVER get to see those re-runs these days.

       a waste of money  after school today, i had the sudden bright idea of following jeremy, qi wen, augustine, brian, edmund, sam and joo yeow... to play counterstrike at this stupid shop that just had to open half an hour late. the conditions for entry are--and quite stupidly too--pretty detrimental to its business. you're not allowed into this particular shop unless you're above 16 and do not wear school uniform. and tell me, how many people are genuinely above 16 and have hour after hour of gaming time to burn?! the stupidest businesses are those that kill off their biggest user bases instantly.  and then qi wen, jeremy and i went to this place called cine leisure, only to meet freddie and a female companion, and yuba bowling with his 5 million girlfriends and... never mind. and then jeremy convinced me to get a birthday present for mohawk, which should be flattering because quite sadly i have never gotten a birthday present for my buddies. even KS bought me a chicken wing for my birthday. so spending 50c on a crappy card (with free envelope)... that's better than nothing.  and guess what i returned with: a lingering headache (at its worst when i was still in that stupid game place--i'll never ever visit one again), a new glow-in-the-dark shirt & lots of holiday homework. wow so cool. byeeee.

       eternal doom & destruction  eh, today feels so good: ms tan gave us 2 pieces of comprehension to finish, by my understanding (if using it this way is grammatically correct and free from american influence), is due tomorrow.  today's quote is from godspeed you! black emperor, the greatest orchestral rock band with a queer name. and no, while my own liking for their material remains to be seen (ie, i am fickle), they're fine poets without contest (punctuation mine because i happen to be bad at it and need practise):  the future is bleak, uncertain, beautiful. tomorrow they might come and arrest us all. only if you listen closely can you hear the machines beneath the sidewalk whipsering. the machines beneath the sidewalk are always whispering. strive to listen close.

       succinctness  here goes: today i'm playing a game in which you kick a round ball along on a grass patch. this grass patch has a foundation layer of brown substance called soil, upon which green blades (among other types of contraptions that are collectively known as the artificial environment) called "grass" sprout like green blades called grass (which grow at identical rates as green blades called grass). the idea of the game is to run over the grass blades over and over again with expensive shoes that have little projections for the supposed function of gripping the soil better. the shoes are called "the official footwear of this game in which you kick a round ball along a grass patch blah blah blah".  in the event of a participant or player not playing within the rules of the game or causing irreparable harm to another player physically, mentally or otherwise, the referee may give him a caution or dismiss him from the game completely. a second caution issued during the game will also render a dismissal. there is no such thing as a third (or fourth, or sixty-fifth) caution, presumably because cautions have no effect on a player when he is fuming at any place beyond the field. the referee usually makes known his intention to caution a player by flashing a thin piece of yellow paper or plastic known to idiots who watch too much of the game in which you kick a round ball along a grass patch blah blah blah on tv as "yellow card". to signal a dismissal, the referee displays a similar thin piece in red and an appropriate gesture with his fingers such as to prevent trouble with the authorities, physical harm from the player to be dismissed, or his immediate self-destruction from eternal guilt. the player must then walk away with an expression similar to that of a person being run over by a train three times over...  n.b.: every time i do this it rains. i believe i have a remedy for drought in my hands.

       laksa vs. emu  i just hate laksa now--i used to practically gulp down bowl after bowl of the stuff in primary school, but this homemade edition totally stinks. you see, the holiday is a good time for me to get a bit bulky, but the rate at which i'm consuming this delicious home-cooked food is frightening in a word.   and damn it my dad should just stop refilling the fridge with coke. i thought i kicked the habit already since just two days ago i was drinking fruit juice so frantically i thought i'd die drinking it. but noooo, my dad just has to appear with a carton of coca-cola. would you rather pay $3 a day on fruit juice to fight an addiction or pay nothing to fuel it?  ah, those effing choices.

       mystery & porcupine magic  i was bored this afternoon and behind me where the window overlooks the road, millions of fine raindrops were pelting everything in sight into a wet (soggy for the grass patch) but sufficiently recognisable incarnation. all that is left of the rain now is the smell; the slight, stale sensation of soil floats around. so much for a lonely late afternoon for the typical singlet-wearing teenage singaporean... like myself. my current desire is to have a good camera so that i can spend time outside taking pictures. i believe that it's the only way for me to get out of this prison i love so much...

       live with you  KS, D and i went to play football at this park where there was a family carnival... apparently they were having a game to determine who had the longest, and then the biggest... thing. 2 females paid to talk dirty on a family carnival = priceless.  i went to eat at the hawker centre later... a simple meal of duck rice & a bowl of soup comes to the tune of $5. $2 was spent on the soup alone--a delightful mix of bittergourd, chicken pieces and tomatoes. the pieces of fibre from gently disintegrated tomato float around conspiciously. a slight (and rather pleasant) taste of garlic is palpable. the soup itself is a strange character. slightly masculine with the bittergourd's--um--bitterness and gently sweet & sour from the tomatoes. everything is boiled to perfect softness. the chicken bones within crumble with a delightful chomp. with every mouthful of duck and rice i down spoonful after spoonful of this soup. simply magic...  now playing: suit of lights by elvis costello (it goes without saying that elvis costello is brilliant beyond words, but i really like restating myself over and over again).

       why i am one bored, tired & angry soul  1. my tv went bonkers. 2. my fruit juice supply has been depleted.  3. i listened to three straight diana krall songs from an online radio station. yuck.  4. never eat the ayam laksa flavoured maggi noodles. comparing it to the original penang laksa, contrary to the supposed popularity of the noodles, is like comparing drain water and apple juice. (yes. i still mourn the fruit juice.) 5. mamee's vegetarian vermicelli soup is nothing more than a lot of pepper and monosodium glutamate.  6. which tastes nice, but you also have to sleep with a very irritated throat. 7. i've read all the stories at  urlLink slashdot's science section ,  urlLink bbc news  (at least the links in the front page) and  urlLink economist's science section , only to stop halfway through   urlLink guardian unlimited's education section  to ask myself why i have spent three hours reading for no rhyme or reason.  8. i don't mean to offend, but guardian's official weblog sucks.  9. salon is good also, but very US-centric. (so are the UK publications, but they at least recognise the international audience.) 10. local online publications are merely about nokia phones & david beckham (= boring). it's small wonder why people think of singaporeans with little opinions of our own & and as an easy marketshare of "4 million loyally stupid people". 11. cappucino makes me very grumpy indeed. i don't know why, but i'll find out some day.

       bam wham  i am having the most meaningless dinner, washed down with apple juice with pieces of aloe vera, just about the smartest thing the fruit juice company executives (and the chemists) have ever done for us. yes sir.  just as a little warning to you, never never never buy a cookbook teaching you how to cook dishes with tofu like my mother did. never. because after you spend about $4 billion buying the thing, you actually have to cook the tofu dishes and (gasp)  eat  them (predictably to justify your conscience). i'm having three tofu dishes now. not a joke.   that said, my father once told me that the thai "hawker centres" (or whatever they call them) keep little containers of chilli padi for customers because snacking on everything with a big blob of chilli is such a big hobby there, and apparently big, snowy cubes of tofu go just fine with them. or maybe it's all a pack of lies because this chilli padi (and unwont amounts of light soy sauce) that is going with the fourth of the five tofu cubes i have to conquer today doesn't seem to have an effect on the taste at all. that is, this tofu is totally tasteless. i am fearless, i say. you might frighten our 15000-strong poor Mr Tastebuds (they all share the same surname) from the Tongue Department, but wait till you meet mr Hydrogen Chlorine from the Stomach Department. just you wait.

       desist  i caught 35 minutes of study at amk library today: the entire O level acid, base and salt chapter & half of the A level chapter on ionic equilibria. just in time for marcel's class tomorrow you know. because you never know what marcel is going to teach. the other time he gave us this hydrocarbon handout and i spent 3 days furtively reading up on organic chemistry only to have the fellow pretend that hydrocarbon is the middle name of a blue-tailed spadger called Percy. (whether there is such a thing as a blue-tailed spadger is kind of beyond the scope of this entry. i don't like research.)  pfffft. my battle plan for term 3: sleep right through all the chemistry classes, get 3 straight zeroes for the titration exercises, do exactly 3 easy handouts, scoff at 3 of kye's RGS handouts, scrape through with a B3 and listen to kenji talk about how he spent five million months memorising the entire textbook for his 89 marks when i got 75% (75% of 89 that is) there doing almost nothing. which is what i've done in term two, you see, but always third time lucky. always.

       what have you been doing today?  i have been toilet spying. what?! no, not peeping at girls or something. i saw something truly amazing.  i observed five men (with not too much hair on their heads, anything below isn't something i want to notice, thank you) going into the toilet to relieve their bladders. now, you must understand that boys, male adolescents and men alike have to pull out this skin-and-muscle extension from their pants through a resealable (for lack of a better word) cavity on the pants where the two trouser legs meet. the device that "seals" the cavity is known as the zip. there have been countless cases of excruciating pain when a man seals the cavity and forgets something is hanging out.   now having given you the gory and gruesome details, the nightmare is over, and it's time for another. after this, most of us expect that as a sign of self-respect, you wash your hands thoroughly before allowing them to roam elsewhere. and out of the five men, none gave their hands the dignity of a proper soap washing (two gave their hands merely a very brief wash). and four of these men, dirty hands and all, started to run a slow and seemingly deliberate hand (palm + all five fingers of gruesome particles) across their faces. i am not shitting you. one even stood there for a minute rubbing his brows, and then adding yet another round of contamination to his face. i was a tad disappointed from the performance: he didn't dig his nose.   now, of course, i don't happen to be the dirtiest (in another manner apart from touching your face after answering the call of Nature without washing your hands) soul in existance. i just got curious while soaping my hands slowly... and emerged more than shocked. and now i decide it's an opportune time to let you know as well. muahahahaha. so be careful the next time your boyfriend emerges from the toilet and holds your hand / touches your face, hair or anything else you deem important (or anything--anything at all--more intimate than that. thank you, and you heard it first at channel "the bad things that men do".

       today's food review: mutton soup  i woke up late today, so at four pm i decided to have a very late "brunch"--supposedly an singapore-exclusive term from the obvious coinage of the first two meals of the day, but its existence has somewhat eluded my attention since the beginning of time. till recently, that is. so i had mutton soup at a hawker centre.  the soup is as advertised: mutton slices, a few pieces of coriander and exactly six short stalks of young celery, sliced ginger in the soup. and that is all. the taste of the soup, depending on your mood, teeters on the fine line between mediocrity and weird tastiness--it is reminiscent of bak ku teh, which i like (very much). the mutton slices are well-cooked and taste brilliant when matched with the chilli sauce--one of those made of chilli paste easily available at the market doused with plenty of lime with enough to ruin a supermodel's face. you would expect extras--but you get none.   the surprising thing is that this is one of the times where you order a soupy dish with so little in it that you can't actually finish with two bowls of rice. instead i walked home briskly with a stomach threatening to empty itself at a flash of my disobedience. or maybe it's just me--yesterday i couldn't even finish a upsized burger king meal and a cheesecake pie, which i have been able to do for the past century. thank you thank you thank you. let me nurse my stomach, you pitiful monkeys.

       a day of firsts  friday was a day of many firsts. and also, coincidentally or otherwise, the unluckiest day of my life. now if you know me well enough, you will know that i'm unluckier than the average person at the very least. but friday was terrible.   i'm not going to tell you all about the unluckiest day of my life, as i think it's well-etched into my (future) memoirs, but right now i have a very big corn (the patch of skin, not the tasty, yellow crop) obtained while i rested the part of my palm below the region of my thumb smack on the metallic part of a very hot platter holding my steak. and i also watched the first movie of my life. i don't remember its title. i just remember the fight sequences, the hot girls, and (um) monty python's john cleese as the parent of one of the girls who thinks she's a hooker or something. hey, not a brilliant performance by JC, but it was good nonetheless. i can't say much of the whole movie though. it's a waste of time, and that's why teenagers like us love them. muahahaha.  that'll teach me not to mess with the sacred Confucian Analects and change the lines to eternally comical, grotesque re-versions. it is, from kw's reactions, probably about the funniest thing to hit the planet since minestrone soup. later, people.

       cookbook  i bought some cream rice today. it's exactly what you think it is, if you're normal: cream, and rice. the "cream" itself is a mix of overly sweet cocoa and vanilla, but kudos to heinz: i believe that any other addition to the ingredients would have made it utterly inedible. also, i have a packet of a "hot cup special" minestrone soup. as most of you know, my favourite soups are mostly ones with a lot of vegetables, and one of the biggest achievements in my life is having downed a hot bowl of cream of celery. but i hate the croutons with the soup. nine out of ten times, the croutons that they sell with the soup taste horrible.  and not to mention, the croutons look ugly floating around on my mug. later.

       photons + mystery  now listening: o'rourke, wilco (o'rourke-mixed), sonic youth (o'rourke is a member now), stereolab (o'rourke mixed this too), gastr del sol (o'rourke collaboration) and the microphones (which hopefully has nothing to do with o'rourke). yes. 80% of the music i've been listening to are associated with jim o'rourke in some way or another. and i swear i never knew it.   but then again, i've also been reading a lot of stuff from  urlLink project gutenberg ... all the famous classics in their unabridged glory. it's also so great that you can actually annoy people on the internet with creative editing of the Confucian Analects. thank you.

       lessons to learn  today's music: flaming lips, clearlake (typical british dry wit; radiohead-esque british band), badgerlore, fog and spoon. (always a rocker right at the end to ruin the quiet. but spoon aren't bad...)  yesssss. i went for tuition today, and i took 1/3 (not sure which third because it is said that they arrange it in order of difficulty) of a scholastic aptitude test for english and got 19/20. vocabulary, analogous relationships and a reading passage. and the last time i took a "full" SAT test at maya's class was last year and i got 48/60. maya says that score is okay. ya right i bet it's grotesque. and chemistry was okay. i stole just 12 pieces of pH indicator strips from marcel. errr and marcel says that he will go through the stupid oxidation chapter "in due time". come on, hurry up--i want to sleep for khooooooo's lessons. auuughhhhhh. so many tables to learn, so little time (tomorrow, thursday, friday & the weekend). everytime that khoo looks at me it's always with a surprised expression, like i have a big exclamation mark printed on my shirt or something.   ok la hahaha i need to learn some more chemistry then i also can sleep through all of khoo's lessons next year. that's my ambition for now, you wet blankets. and now, i'll just anticipate my breakfast. it's coming up at 2am.

       just the right one  now listening to: stereolab, o'rourke, fennesz (sp?), sonic youth.   i'm a lazy person, so i spend quite a lot of time listening to music sleeping in bed with the laptop by my side. and today i accidentally added the wrong sonic youth song to my "playlist", meticulously constructed to fill my ears with tranquil, lush lounge music + downtempo + a bit of trip-hop. and then guess what happened: i was already soaring in the skies at the checkpoint to dreamland, and then kim gordon had to interrupt my journey with her song (i.e., her vocals) about plastic suns and her mother smoking grass or something (which i obviously couldn't decipher until i heard it again fully concious), and a kilotonne of guitar screeching. granted, one's appreciation of somewhat loud, screeching music is at its lowest when you're just about to drift to sleep. oh, go away, kim.  and then i rose from an unusually warm, unfamiliar smelling bed (my sheets were changed this morning) to get myself a cultured-milk drink called vitagen. hard to describe, but the fun part of drinking vitagen is trying to drain the liquid into your throat and allow the milk substances to coagulate. wish for something milky and sour to chew on when you're bored? you've got it.

       man-go-s-teen  ah, good evening. today's dinner was  roti prata  and chicken curry. the roti prata was fried by my father and it sucked ice-cream. there's a skill to frying a decent piece of roti prata that i am beginning to appreciate. the thing is that you can't put too much oil or it will drip like a dog's nose in your mouth, and if you put too little, there's no taste at all. at least an excessive amount of grase tastes grotesque. and to have just a bit more moisture (and flavour) you could add an egg to it.  a bit about eggs: they contain 98% of the essential amino acids for our diet. eggs should be cooked because raw egg white contains avidin which is deactivated by cooking. it's been said that eggs are bad for your health because of the high cholesterol content, although a (very) recent study suggests that the amount of blood cholesterol in the blood is more dependent on saturated fat in the diet as opposed to dietary cholesterol.   this also goes somewhat in hand with the success of the carbohydrate-control-not-fat-control  urlLink robert atkins diet  which invited ridicule after he first introduced it in the '70s. he died two months ago, a year after science & statistics proved that the well-established (but incorrect) idea that a low-fat diet is the only way to go. maybe some other robert could try the diet out...

       quasi-fiction  the photos of the slightly chubby but nonetheless mouth-watering model that we took at photography class have vanished into thin air... from being wedged between the pages (of worksheets) of the Owner's file, through the pores of the bag zipper, into infinity and beyond. i am utterly dismayed.    my bowels and my nose had a catfight today over nature's call. i was wondering whether to suffer the cigarette fumes from the people chain-smoking inside the toilet cubicles next to the one that would have to entertain me for the next half-hour, but i decided to bring my sorry ass (and my sorry bowels) home instead while a free-for-all-fight broke out inside my tummy. thanks, buddies.   ordinarily jim o'rourke's simple humming refrain over light, wispy bass, subtle & rubbery piano, and horns evoke a sense of appreciation in my head, but now it's all headache. and time for a lie: the sweet scent of love will be in the air...  ... tomorrow at the CHIJ toa payoh carnival. apparently that place will be swarmed by people from my school and all, and CC has $25 of those coupons, so i figure that we'll all assemble at CC's house at 10am, fight the crowds, and gorge our mouths with free, badly-cooked food, since girls who can cook are now an extinct species, what more attractive girls with nice legs who can cook and study and argue with you about bernard shaw and j j thompson and alan paton with more ease than putting on clothes. and as far as putting on clothes is concerned, i much prefer the antagonistic action. muahahahaha.

       three is the word  today is the wettest day of the year. it has rained three times already (at different locations). and then we had youth day celebrations today and threw "water bombs" at everyone else (cc threw 20 of the kind at strangers and classmates, and remained dry to the very last... until kenji came along). then two very refined gentlemen from jeremy's class started firing unsavoury & utterly distasteful vocal salvos at me, which isn't entirely surprising if you have some idea about what the people in my school are like.   later i went with jeremy, cc, kenn (who had a good time making his st patrick's nemeses suffer with his impartial judgment...), edmund and malcolm to watch the second movie of my life, one which i will have to pay on my own. it's also lousy but it's funny enough, and not particularly memorable. i didn't join in the bowling and the card game, especially since the latter defies my own philosophy with regards to gambling cards, and i think i'd have done even worse than cc at the bowling alleys anyway.   and then i sent an undesirable  urlLink message  to one of jeremy's  female friends, who shot back an electronic message a few minutes later with a  genuine  venom that made me chuckle slightly. and in my repentence i wanted to... apologise (in my own special way) over the phone, but this person is apparently... um... quite unbending to sincere apologies and the like, so i think i should apologise in this space in hopes that it will ease my conscience. (yes sir, i have a conscience.) or maybe i should be more concerned about my dinner instead.

       damnation  yes, this interweb thing is so fun. my "msn messenger" service does not work, apparently--just because maybe i use a mac or  urlLink some other reason  that might be related to my  urlLink intelligence . i've been spending some time reading on bertrand russell's articles about religion and agnosticism, and then arguing with CY over this... and all the chemistry stuff we're learning. personal rivalry. don't ask.  meanwhile, i think i might be hooked onto milk again. i bet this is somewhat instinctive. as you know, milk is one of the few drinks i know of that will relieve the burning hot sensation of chilli padi (which i have with my meals pounded with sambal belachan... mmm). and it tastes so... um... filling. yes. milk, fruit juice, lots of curry puffs. all right. sleep beckons, bye.

       another hits the dust  kwen, also known as the person who sits next to me in class, has bought yet another nokia phone. considering the prices of an MMS download - $2.60 per small, poor-quality picture with next to no value - this equates to getting cheated. kwen's feeble excuse for this is that M1 - in his books a completely reputable, reliable company with no intention to overcharge for their services - will keep his wonderful imagery forever... so that his great-great-grandkids will be able to sell them at a profit.   hey, don't put kwen down. he's only giving M1 and nokia a steady income. and trying to be hip. but if i were kwen, i'd resort to cheating people to be fashionable instead. just like eating with spoons and eating spoons. literally, of course. kwen could bring ms spoon to a dinner-and-dance and then proceed to do acts familiar to "haters of young kids". they just produce 'em, put 'em in boxes and step on 'em repeatedly and then you have... trampled goat meat. and then you could eat the spoon with the meat for your daily fix of carbohydrates and proteins. and vitamin sik hui...

       ooh, and they assemble  a punk rock lover  urlLink explains  why she is so anti-social: because she "stole the fried onion spoon today to eat it". now, i'm not trying to express feign surprise, since many people i know are weird in their own way, but none even begin to challenge this spoon eater. this is a milestone in complete peculiarity.   of course, all punk rock lovers are somewhat like that... perhaps this one is a bit too obsessive. today's thought of the day: never try socialising with people in the canteen while eating fried onion spoons. not only is the deep frying unhealthy, onion also makes your breath stink, and spoons are just little carriers of solid and liquid food made out of wood, plastic or metal, probably the first tools made for eating invented by Man. hooray to food carriers you can eat! this is a revolution!

       fishing in a pond  mr tay is a fucking butthole. i've got 25 pages of useless resources in a typeface too humanly small to make much of. honours chemistry my ass. i'll do these pages of crap an honour by tearing them up into pieces. of course, much of the stuff about electron affinity (why f.e.a. has exceptions for fluorine, etc) and ionisation energy (with enough exceptions to the rule to fill a 1-litre bottle... and having more to spare for your "vanilla coca-cola"). & so on. electronegativity scale is just page 4. and just because the microscopic dynamics of atoms depend on physical laws, i also have to know a million irrelevant physics formulas? what's this world coming to? tomorrow i expect someone to add physics formulas to my english textbook since " all the dynamics that lead to your purchase, your reading, your mental processing of information, and ultimately your destruction of this book in total frustration, are solely based on physical laws, so pay up ".  sorry, i'm like that when you have o'rourke on and then bach's air from suite in D and then radiohead. because it's about the best formula to turning so stupidly caustic. causticism is stupid. only stupid people become caustic. wise people just laugh away at them. the wisest people, on the other hand, shall probably turn to other sources of inspiration to make quotes that stupid people will copy for the next twenty-odd generations. are you hungry? are you sad? join my club for the bored, lonely and dead. leave me alone while i download ten 10-minute classical pieces to put liszt (a regular on my playlists) to shame. bye.

       hints hints  one.  urlLink someone  is obviously... a. too serious at his tuition class; b. with 2 million female companions, and  now , officially a  urlLink "hater of young kids" , so we can come to the final conclusion that this person obviously thinks a. mature, sensible & smart enough to sprout wings and fly in the working world (literally or otherwise--your guess) and b. when human beings experience a stage of life called puberty, they become a totally different species also known as Homo sapiens-I-am-a-great-adult-because-I-am-2-kilometres-tall. try talking me out of this illusion--you might get my drift when you actually access one of those links. two.  urlLink what goes around comes around.

       pomp & circumstance  cc didn't turn up and made us wait for his sorry ass at the chij carnival from 12pm to 2.30pm. i swear that i saw plenty of credibly pretty girls with nice legs to boot. i bet they just put on their PE kit to agitate their male guests today, and i have few objections to the strategy. and i bid farewell to $1 just to have a song dedicated to sik hui which i bet they didn't play.   on the way home i only waved briefly at sj and a male companion with a plastic bag holding my "dong ding" (ahahahaha!) oolong tea tied to one of the "belt brackets" on my trousers, and two club sandwiches (the ones jason's mother makes come with preserved mango) which i was about to demolish on the spot. i think they went to celebrate mich's birthday or something. happy birthday mich, may you have the shortest hair for life, or something. like joey.  anyway, cy has to be the most irritating pest on the planet. she's trying to convert me from oolong tea to japanese tea (both of us have more exotic flavours of tea in mind but those are only afforded by the very rich and the very crazy), which i dislike for its inferior brand of bitterness. i love bitter stuff, just not too bitter. why so green, i'm lonely, i'm lonely... we're just accidents waiting to happen.

       ufo  mich and unidentified company claimed that they saw me near the mcdonald's outlet paya lebar talking to a signboard. what makes these people think that i talk to a signboard is beyond my comprehension, but apparently, it's about time to list all the things i did and have done around this area.  look, considering that i have in past visits, ordered meals and then disappeared, sounded the long john silver's bell until my ears couldn't take it any more, and belched enough times to chase away 2 tkgs girls who were as thin as sticks but occupied six seats... i would never, ever talk to a signboard. i'd even drink ice lemon tea for once, or play a bit of this game called "warcraft" if i learnt to, but i'd never ever talk to a signboard. never.   you people just go away or something while i gargle a solution called self-pity.

       i knt speel  we have a chinese test tomorrow. as you may or may not already know, my chinese standard has gone beyond the state of desolation. yesterday, i swear i knew at least three different chinese words. but now my fever (and this miracle cooling water) has almost brainwashed me. i can't figure out anything that lsm has to say about her herbal medicines, her herbal torture clinics OR her virgin child yellow liquid sea. and neither can i make much out of our new chemistry teacher's (khoo ye... come back! now!) half-honkie-half-anglican accent. maya thinks it's an overdose of the official english accent of the world™; but considering that this teacher of mine - not unlike my physics teacher, my mother and a thousand million people - like to add plurals to all kinds of esoteric nouns. it could be that my hearing faculties are on the decline. old age. even marcel doesn't look that old.   but i guess any teacher would be better than our physics teacher at english now; even ms half-anglican. mr physics teacher, of course, has a brilliant penchance for language that does not resemble English in all its flavours as we know them. his best attempt at good english, according to the slides that he has uploaded to our school portal, counts to a measly 25 english language errors with extra consultation, giving concessions on very liberal terms.   time to down another bottle of cooling water. i'll see you in the south pole. i'm the human with RB the penguin cutting my toenails.

       woe  i spent most of today with a terrible headache and a slight fever. after gallivanting with a few people for lunch after school, i finally got a chance to purchase this great cooling water rubbish. it killed jeremy's cold almost instantly, but there was little effect on  me ... until just now. my fever is beginning to "break" - the formal term of which i am uncertain - and i am sweating a little as i type this.   obviously jeremy is forgetting someone else in his quest to usurp kenn from his "humanities supreme" reign. that someone else passed his exam by getting less than a handful of marks (over fifty) for structured essay. just a kind reminder.  and on to other things. i hope i turn up for school tomorrow. or maybe i hope i have another bottle of iodine to empty during she***-the-not-so-thin's lesson. or maybe i hope that someone will shoot JTCK and WJ like dogs. or maybe i hope i'll become a gaming expert overnight. or maybe i hope i won't slack in class tomorrow, provided i attend school. or maybe i hope for... er... a thousand wishes, and a big house... and i hope for another thousand wishes and the skies...

       opposites  we had a false fire alarm today. that was met by a very loud chorus of boos after the entire school actually got their ass up to assemble at the basketball courts in what seems to be record time to realise that... it wasn't a grandiose display of school infrastructure by whatever department involved.   malcolm left maya's tuition class a bit earlier on a very real emergency, however. at the time his grandfather was in critical condition at the hospital, so i hope (and all my hopes are - hopefully - not too belated) that they will both emerge all right. even if my best guesses tend to overestimate his intelligence, grave matters like this aren't meant for us to fool around with. best of luck.   i still haven't done any of my homework yet, which is quite the occurance at 9.30pm on a cool weekday night. time to demolish my oolong tea and tear my short hair. and kenn, resident  urlLink flirt  is up to his antics again. of course, jeremy & i still remember the time he pretended we were mole rats or the like and turned into a super-nice-boy to talk to this chij tp girl reminiscent of... never mind. it never ends up as a compliment to a girl, anyway. and neither did i intend one. hahaha. sleep beckons...!

       pillow tales  today, we mark the departure of the entity that has meant more to me than any human, animal or plant on this planet: my beloved yellow pillow. i call it the yellow pillow because it's what it was wearing last night, before my mother decided to take leave and then remove it from earthly existence. the pillow, i must have you know, is about the thing most people come into contact with more often than anything else in the world. and for some time already, my beloved little pillow has been communicating in tender, subtle wisps of scent with me. oh, you poor, poor thing, how you must be rotting away in a rubbish pile somewhere. i hope they bury you with full military honours or something.   you must think i am somewhat a psycho, but maybe you might reconsider this when you think about 15-year-old boys crowding around a stupid shop buying gaming cards (in somewhat, but not in entirety, refined language)...  "so who's this boyfriend of yours?" "uh... ah seng. that's his name." "ah seng, ah..... tell me one thing you do, and do very well." "well auntie, i am a gaming card enthusiast. i get cheated to collect stupid little pieces of cards like it's marijuana." "that's good. i shall give you my daughter's hand in marriage. now."  and so on. yes. singapore is a home for the truly disturbed. thanks.

       libido & the troubles  i almost remind myself of a i have 9 pictures from the studio photography class that we developed in the dark room; all is well. in addition to the two photos of "chubby girl" kwen marketed to the class as my latest girlfriend, i now have pictures of a girl in a swimsuit, another girl in a spaghetti-strap outfit in another (but by no means is this the only outfit she is clad in, which must be a tad disappointing), and a casually-dressed (the requirements of cloth on a girl's body, of course, reduces exponentially with time, so take the term with a pinch of salt) girl with a lascivious / libidinous smile to kill.   the products of the shooting, i must add, are well-deserved considering the things you have to do after taking the photograph itself; consideration to brightness, shutter speed and picture composition is challenging. the next thing is that you have to develop the film in a dark room, this involves an hour or so of shaking the film in a canister containing a chemical that  must  exist at 20 degrees Celcius, so add another hour to preparation. finally, you have to spend another few hours developing the film. you have to do test strips for practically every picture you want to do, and you have to re-crop the picture, and if you accidentally screw up you get a picture that turns out all black, or if you developed it in the safe-light you get... nothing. after that you have to put the picture in 3 different chemicals, the first of which gives a yellow-brown stain on our white shirts and trousers. one of my trousers now have a stain that has been strategically placed to locate where the trouser-legs meet. and you have to develop the picture at an apeture that above 5.6, but then you need to focus the image with 2.8 since anything else is not clear enough, and if you forget to change back to 5.6...   given the astounding failure rates for a novice like myself, the defining moment of a budding photographer-cum-developer... is to see the pictures form correctly; to see the thing of beauty seal its place in recorded history. but even this is temporary if you do not put it in the fixer chemical & running water long enough!

       pigeons  now listening to chet atkins' guitar instrumental re-working of a beatles staple "if i fell". it almost reminds me of a little paradise and i'm a short, stout taxi driver with a healthy beer belly and every day there will be a plump girl to massage my smelly toes and lots of iced citrus fruit drinks and a warehouse of fresh fruit within a hundred metres and... mmm... no school. the ending gives a totally different impression. it comes to a halt almost like a car would, and then you get out and realise the world isn't as cool & fresh smelling (although the fresh-smelling chemicals, mr low once said, screw with your psychological rhythms). of course, it's quite marxist in a john lennon way: demure, hopelessly idealistic; but people like lennon only make the world a better place. lennon and those monty python guys.   i spent the entire afternoon scanning and touching up a few photos. the reason for my apparent lack of productiveness more lies in the software and the stupid dell computer. i'd expect, for a two month old computer, it should be fast enough for most purposes. but apparently everything i do it just slows to a halt and shows an alert talking about "virtual memory". and you thought simulation was only for CG animation movies. some people have an admirable amount of patience to handle this rubbish from day to day, but not me. sorry.   kenn has a collection of  urlLink crappy photos of our class , so i might as well point you to the various interesting shots: someone who appears to be me reeling in pain after an evil  urlLink Joseph Punch , a stupid pencil case i got in August 1995 that is now mutilated and vandalised  urlLink beyond recognition , jeremy yap getting  urlLink slaughtered , and my favourite  urlLink slacking project  in cheena class, and wei jun  urlLink after he ate  the stupid burger i pasted on his back. bye.

       goodness of my heart  today was crazy. i wrote a 1.5 page composition about some insignificant person in my usual broken chinese, wrote about 100000 words wrong, had half the essay marked out in red ink, and i actually passed. by 20 marks. don't ask me, all right. i don't even speak a word of chinese. i understand as much chinese as, say, a bald beaver does. lsm torture clinic: we'll kill you by giving you significantly more marks than you deserve.   i devoured an entire cup of that badham milk that no one dared to touch. i think the almond chunks at the bottom were a nice touch. i've also signed up for one house activity - which is required, or else you do AIMS - to throw as many pieces of paper into the wastepaper basket from only three metres away as possible. this is a lifeskill that i have - quite predictably - honed to near perfection in the last two years of my life, and now i can safely say that i'm a marist who can make a difference to society. predictably by throwing waste everywhere with shocking accuracy to electrocute a beaver. bye.

       the sole  today i had fruit salad, meat patties (those that my maid cooks amazingly taste more like potato than whatever meat she used) and a very citrus-enhanced can of diet coca-cola. i read that moby has made the album an industry (the album that started it all was self-made and quite possibly the most critically acclaimed commercially successful album in the late 90s) - by my interpretation, linkin park and the revitalised chinese pop industry is almost completely because of a bald, nerdy, ugly asshole. and a big asshole at that.   i'd like to be like that someday. i'd like - here is where my excessively ambitious plans go - to write a very good (ingenious, in fact) book with parts i butchered off from somewhere else and then make books all over the world a very commercial commodity: less than a hundred pages, overwhelmingly easy to read, and with sluts adorning the covers. the only difference from moby is that i'll actually get the money i truly deserve from my evil schemes, and then start to cheat every singaporean who can walk, talk and spend money out of his or her trousers a trilion times! i'd charge them $2 per bonus word for sequels! of course, one who is sanguine of the IQ of the common singaporean might express his sceptism, but as a US executive once put it: "once you get hold of the government, you automatically get 4 million guinea pigs to experiment on", and einstein's famous quote: "only two things are infinite: the Universe and stupidity, and i'm not sure of the former".   and i'm determined to succeed... and i will... unless some idiot comes up with pancakes we'd all buy willingly for $10 per piece so that we can check the underside for 4D numbers. bye.

       sects of doom  i'm stuck here trying to figure out what i should write for my english composition. the my english composition is decidedly lurid; if you know how my english teacher is like (my average mark for her assignments turns out to be in the D7-E8 range) then the dark themes for composition aren't that surprising any more.  yesterday all our female teachers suffered from a bad bout of PMS, although one looked like she was battling the voices in her head, one is  always  in that pms-y mode, and the last has stomached so much of pms-ness that it was inevitable anyway. ms fong is really nice, err yes she is, she just looks more auntie than she has ever has. and even kok pin exempted us from his physics hell, which i don't really mind in retrospect even though i still had to carry an effing heavy bag home. i'm not a strong little beaver. well. not strong in the areas where i need it the most at this time in life anyway. muahahaha.  errr there's geography test tomorrow. and do i look i remotely care? and wait. there's our school's crappy band concert at victoria concert hall on thursday - which i would go if joo yeow / kwan siang gave me one of those $8 tickets that joo gave to king arthur & the furry (rabbit), feathery (chicken) and crappy animals (errr oxygen is egested during photosynthesis! ha!) for free. and scgs' concert on friday, apparently, costs about $15 dollars. this is overkill - my budget: $0. okay night night.

       ping  ooooohhhh. i am so bored now. we spent the very early afternoon at the PLMGSS funfair talking rubbish to nonplussed girls who leave immediately after we ask for a "table corner", "your green socks", and a "bath bubble"; after that i was - and i still am - rather free. really. i like free things, and sometimes to get things done your way, ethics (and manners and goodwill and peace - just ask george w. bush; someone who deprived millions of dollars to the education of his american students to spend billions on war against a country on the pretext biochemical weapons programme that has not been found yet) must be defied.   but say, i'd like to have a purple balloon that resembles a human phallus (free gonads included!) then slash everyone to bits with it. i rock and you stone. and the PL girls are pebbles. bye.

       defining moments; emu the warrier  we've got plenty of free periods these days: mrs soo has decided to go on strike thanks (majorly) to ivan; ms lee has been reduced from fierce-missus to miss blush-blush; and a few other teachers are turning crazy. and my tuition teacher told us about some politics between the catholic "brothers" in school. see, politics.  to tackle the sudden influx of free time, kenn spends all his time sleeping to digest his food (it is alleged, but i do not know for certain, that he enjoys about a truckful of white floor tiles for fun), while i just stare at the remains of a wasp wei jun brutally murdered two days ago: he swept it from side to side with a broom and then trampled it... and that by someone with a stature that is not very modest by any standards! and its red-and-yellow-but-more-red-than-yellow remains shall stay intact forever.  forever.  and while he's still awake, during english lesson, and with joey around, it's much easier to  urlLink prioritise the daily tasks ; as you can see, my spelling has a lot to be desired. a lot.

       double you  i've been reading a lot at wikipedia again, sorry about that. today was about southeast asian political leaders, since earlier this morning i was quite enchanted by mahathir's very eloquent dismissal of globalisation in three words: gobbledygook, globaloney and gobblisation. and his authoritarian collectism thing sounds interesting... somewhat like controlled marxism. i think next week will be about euclid of alexandria, bartholomew roberts (the most successful pirate of all time), and... probably uday hussein. fascinating people they are.   benjamin lai from the G class "blocked" me (from his "contact list") under the assumption that i want to speak to him (maybe rudely or something) in the first place. of course, i have no personal feud with mr ben, and although i hear a lot of people from outside don't take a strong liking to his personality (or his over-friendliness towards a certain scgs nerd i know of), i have no rights to critique others for what they are and what they are... not. yup. so if you're reading this, mr lai, i just ask that you find someone to push over that is preferably your own size. i'll just stay here and talk to the mice.   i'm arguing with kenn about beetles. this is some way to spend time while the both of us fail our furking spelling test tomorrow. bye!

       murder  i just overheard a toddler screaming at the top of its lungs, the performance only muffled by the traffic outside (across the road, someone is having an auction or some other secret gathering). which is scary. it alternates between screaming and silence and screaming and silence, as if the poor fellow is being tortured as i type this. or maybe he is... dead. i hope not. because i've just read some of the best ghost short stories of the past fifty years, and my conscience is... quite tarnished. thank you.   i once had this dream about arguing with the voices in my head. these critters took form in duplicates of this short young boy with messy hair (which is what you would see if you had the misfortune of waking up next to me one cool early morning) and eyes that threaten to shut without a daily dose of caffeine, and they blame me vehemently for not learning to think and communicate with others in my native language, which is supposed to be chinese.   but then the spotlight intensified, the skies gave way to Destiny, and all the elves gathered in front of me; with a microphone stand (and the microphone) in front of me, i could only say the most brilliant thing a person can ever say to the voices in his head in a nightmare:  "i fucking dare you to speak to me in chinese. NOW."  then i woke up to cold feet and the prospect of another boring day in school, and i felt like i had just conquered the world. but i only declared victory when i had my morning mug of coffee, since at five a.m. in the morning alertness is still in hibernation somewhere in my ass. goodnight.

       protect eyesight  listening to: badly drawn boy, kraftwerk's new EP, avalanches, st germain, four tet. not brilliant, but sufficient. i now think that maybe i want a satellite radio and not an mp3 player.   kenn asked me to suggest a "classic". i suggest mutiny onboard hms bounty, but not just because the tahitian ladies are "horny" beyond mortal expectation. (ah yes, hormones.)   yesterday i asked sngs smartie to do some maths sums from my overdue homework for me, which i conveniently forgot how to do just because my eyesight is kind of failing me. (and more because i'm just damned stupid.) right now i owe her something. like an encyclopedia or something. argh bye.

       tralala and all the junk  had second ngak howe lesson this week. ahhh, first the politics among the brothers in school, now the politics between maya and an insignificant fat lady. and maya versus ---- and maya versus ######. so you want to know. and you shall not know.   i swear i'm choking on malcolm's (the real malcolm, by the way) deodourant. i have no idea why i asked him to let me spray some on myself. i think we're all getting vain: arthur now is never seen without some hair cream in close proximity, everyone's hair smells more or less the same from using  the same hair wax, and i spray deodourant to smell like flowers. no hair cream; i only use that if i'm on a mission. bye.

       big evil  i'm at the school library watching people one to two years my junior at this neopets web site (and chattering away and getting scolded by ms heng and kind of playing around with the keyboard and so on). you can imagine that; in no more than six months i reckon they'll write compositions that say something like this:   when i was young, stupid and silly...  ah well. let's not fill in and destroy the fun. you can ask kenn for the rest: ahhh, all grown up and ready to adorn a tie. and go to work. and face retrenchment. and... old age, pension, death and taxes. and damned lies.   i'm due for mr foo's tuition & i haven't eaten & the canteen sells lousy food & it's probably closed by now anyway. bye.

       key words  the carrier man kenn was not very nice today. you know, the carrier air conditioners they used to promote on the telly: just a smiling young man with a most enterprising & ambitious gleem in the eye carrying an air conditioner with three fingers and then proceeding to drop it on your toes in typical gorilla-hates-human fashion. that's kenn. the same promising young man who wrote about how innocent, foolish and silly he was when he was young. i imagine he's about fifty years old in his head and fifteen years old physically.  but quoting from s.e. hinton's outsiders, which happens to be the book i'm using for my ERIL project tomorrow: "yesterday was years ago. a lifetime ago." and my dear ladies and gentlemen, like ms tan would say, that's how the years add up for kenn: like fucking exponentially. (vulgarities mine.)  i saw ms zaleha buying things (what exactly is the british english version of "groceries", my 10 years of a very bad hybrid of american and british english ask; i believe ms zaleha will have the answers) at cold storage after ngak howe tuition, and given that my school's english teachers are the most brutal markers in the entire country, it would be better to get into her good books so i can possibly pass my SA if she's marking any of those sections.   but no: untucked shirt, nametag in pocket, my school tie is tied around my waist like a slimming device, and... mmmm bratwurst sausag. like bratwurst sorsarg. yum. bye.

       patriot day  i went for the national day parade thing just a few hours ago, and given that this is my first time in such a massive gathering, and this is the first time i've come so close to speakers that boom so loud (the emcees hardly had the courtesy to at least speak at a normal volume, instead of screaming), and this is the first time i've seen fireworks literally cracking and flowering over my head. it was beautiful. each time some of those shot high into the sky, it boomed so loud the ground shook, and for a moment it felt everything was unsteady, surreal, but mortally noisy. (human civilisation has a tendency to be noisy, for the uninitiated - i always like to make sure aliens know what is going on.)  right now my ears are sort of ringing in pain (despite the fact that i covered my ears through the noisiest parts of the parade - which probably spans to about a third of the time). i have no idea how kenn + jeremy managed to get through the entire ordeal with perfect hearing faculties, but i suspect that they are either immune to this or they are deaf. or they will be in due time, but it's not as if i am desperate for that to happen. or maybe my ears are soft, watery and... fragile.   i wrote only one sms to a fan of my blog with much difficulty; i hope - um - you pay your taxes promptly. okay bye.

       p stands for the holy grill  went to play football with isaiah, khairul, daryl and the crazy nut who just runs on and on by his own before khairul cuts him down with more grace than a swan. and oks is just... mugging and mugging and mugging away. if isaiah can run until the cows return home for the sixtieth time at a go, oks can mug twice as much.   and exams. argh. i hate exams. kenn just makes me so effing jealous cos he just studies so much you could smell his studiousness lingering in the air like a very long, very loud, and above all very disgusting fart. bonus points for a "squisssshhhhh-brapppppp" accompanying band.   if you are into queer and sometimes lazy brit music, try stereolab. it's not anything as brilliant as their '94 work, but it's more electronic goodness and more queerness and so forth. cy says it's the soundtrack of my life: it sizzles, it fuzzes and pulses, it is naughty and playful, and buzzes with "blatant transgress of the immaculateness of pre-puberty". and yes, that's why i am sometimes filled with a tremendous envy and respect for cy's command of my favourite language, and sometimes filled with a certain desire to choke her with a nylon cord because she can sometimes sound like she is one of those people who flip through a thick thesaurus just to get a sophisticated word to use. when she is, to the best of my understanding, nothing of the kind. and yes: run-on sentences (because i cannot remember what the actual term is) and bad grammar is... good. or bad.

       the three peaks   ... and the dried soil caked on the boy's very adolescent legs. the rest of the boy was merely a portrait of uninspired human ruins, of destitute and dystopia, and what had left of it was a face marred with fresh blood stains that would never stop, not until he had breathed his last at least. the air never seemed so still before; but only when Mister Hope had trudged around the corner and  urlLink out of sight  with the chains of restrain on his ankles clinking before him had the world turned pitch black for the boy, and he left a most torturesome world for the next.    still at work on ngak howe's third essay. always requires a lot of thought, you see: i'm already out of ideas. tay says to use the interweb as my big library. screw the national library, you've got project guthenberg: sans the attractive covers, the pretty printed text, and the irreplaceable satisfaction of flipping to the last page of a lengthy novel. okay. bye.

       impervious  i'm on a six or seven composition marathon for ngak howe's class. woohoo. should i write the one about describing the scene in a restaurant first or the one about "joy" first? i also have two books: one, a collection of short stories by  urlLink wong meng voon , another is one of catherine lim's slightly fast paced, slightly feminised books. uncharacteristic for a novella but perfect for boys with short attention spans. i have actually written a very very long composition about "joy", but it's far too austere and every sentence i write conflicts with the next, so i have decided to re-write. here is the rubbish i am going to discard:   ... the wealth of joy is always compounded by the onset of puberty; at an age like ours, puberty is more likely a self-imposed set of prejudices targeted towards emulating the idea of adulthood. when naivete seemingly trudges off and carries its custom elsewhere, its persistent & wraithlike phantom incarnation remains...  the life of a young man at the peak of adolescence is merely marked by wraithlike illusions of a world of freedom. a world of freedom, like one might characterise a region in the world untouched by the long arms of human destruction, is also a world where...  and so much for a composition. this one i'm writing completely sucks, so i am going to tear this paper i have just typed from. farewell, my good friends.

       gloomy  i kind of almost did better than kenji at chemistry. by 1.5 marks. teehee. but no, i had to spell the compound (wrongly) as "nitrite" twice, and my mathematics standard is comparable to a panther's. so that sucks. ditto for physics: CC was half-laughing at eight marks given away to my incredible skill at mathematics, and MISTER KENN HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO GO AROUND THE CLASS HARPING OVER HOW I GOT THE EASIEST 2 MARKA QUESTION IN THE WHOLE PHYSICS PAPER WRONG. ya thanks :|  later i followed cc + malcolm + arthur + wenjun + brian to eat and stare at album after album of cards which have no particular value in my eyes. i'm very, very curious, really. i have no idea why people waste so much of their money buying cards and then selling them at equally high amounts to get almost no nett gain (or a running loss, if you consider arthur -- about three booster packs, twice a week, $4.50 each). i was just pacing up and down outside the MRT station and dying either from passive smoking or from trying to walk away to avoid it each time a new puff came, my head spinning on an axis different from the earth's, and the rest of me was still stuck 30 years into the past.    yes. and i'm almost sick and tired of people asking me to help them manage their steadies. i honestly have no idea, since i haven't reach that point in life where everything i write has a reference to being significantly sillier six months ago while not having eaten some magical tonic made of earthworm guts. (or, for the more direct people in the universe: "i am a real MAN / WOMAN / IDON'TREALLYKNOWBUTI'MSTILLRAGINGWITHHORMONESANYWAY !!!). hoorah for weirdness. goodnight.

       all about jeremius  yes, however have i offended jeremius of the city of lights? i, caesium of rome, demand your ears, your eyes, and your three noses to be cut off by a blunt razor blade. and  then  fetch my grapes. but seriously -- i almost cannot understand why jeremy never thought of the word "emmui" -- the feeling of extreme boredom when parted with your emu plush toy for more than ten seconds.   but as quintus arrius from the 1959 3-hour epic ben hur once said: "you have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it. your eyes are full of hate, Forty-Two. that's good. hate keeps a man alive. it gives him strength."   but ah, jeremy is like a plate of vermin, a community of feisty creepy crawlies mating on a piece of white ceramic. like fireworks that don't work and don't get retrenched (which is - aptly enough - a better way of describing your state of employment given the recent spate of events). like ping pong balls and golf balls, jeremy bounces and reels off every blow from bumblebees and ignites his cheeks with the flames of shame. shame on you, vile, disgusting human! this benevolent emperor of yours may not be in the business of furnishing you with the most evil of death curses, but he does relish the act of physically extracting every  little  extention of your cold, shivering body with a pair of blunt scissors, an axe, and only a cup of tea at eleven.   for now, the emperor wishes to dispense you the honour of mumbling your final prayers very quickly in the last three seconds of your comfortable life. as a no good evil doing perverted slimeball. farewell!

       elective  today is weird: i am having a black soy drink that is not black and a lousy banana cake that tastes more like pandan. as you all know, um, some advertisement on the people's republic of north korea came up in mediacorpse's fine newspaper publication. but i guess the seventy-two hours to seven days of hibernation under my warm blanket nest -- as the fine people who babble and think in chinese call it. of course, these are the same people who came up with the saying "big fish eat small fish; small fish eat prawn crackers."  either they are immensely talented or ingenious, or my translations tend to tread on the fine line between ridiculous and incoherent. and a nasty bird called robert pecking away on your left ear. i hope you fall.   but if the Spandaus prevail and fish ruled the earth for a moment, the earth would dry up like a dog's carcass in the face of three months of arid weather and a wave of hyperactive vultures in mating season... as if it weren't already happening. and yes, vultures are social animals. in celebration of impending freedom. bye.

       watch  the half of the book i did not read was, as you can expect, even more sexually charged than you can imagine. the greatest writers on the planet are also the most obsessive ones. but this isn't merely so much a book about sex as it is a social statement about vileness, about adultery, about how a good (and a bad) turn deserves another, about the thin line that separates lust & greed from savagery. and then it puts a big, lingering question mark over whether the restrictions that men put over themselves edge them towards a bigger ruin. are the morals that rule the order of human procreation flawed and myopic? is incest and human promiscuity acceptable?   cat lim offers few insights as far as the answers are concerned, but if a book report is in order this week or the next, my gut feeling is that barring any chance of mark deduction through charged up description of sexual expression, i might actually ace one of ms tan's work for once. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. dinner time!

       frivolous  i spent a few hours reading through thirty chapters of catherine lim's "the teardrop story woman". it handles the main theme of love in the face of responsibility, obligation and moral customs eloquently at the very least. it flits from person to person with immaculate detail, and as far as the disillusioned teenager is concerned, it also has colourful imagery of bed scenes. nyahahahaha. but it likes to let mister metaphor rule the sequences, which can get overboard at times, but that is only a minor quibble. really. you should read it: not the best of catherine's work, but dirty enough for a teenager's desires and most certainly a good introduction to her better works. serpent's tooth is not that bad also.   almost perfect. i think i have a keen eye for dirty and grim books at the same time. i almost completely rule. time for a celebratory nap.

       ham  i was so bored i read two months of National Geographic from cover to cover. this does not bode well. but the holidays: i can't say much for the holidays. for the past two days i have been -- um -- just playing right through the wee hours of the morning. reading, actually -- i was consuming  urlLink "the bedford-row conspiracy"  by w.m. thackeray, along with the  urlLink first volume of  poe stories  i understood in moderation (this was about three years ago). which isn't a lot when you have been marathon reading for two days. and ah, i love project gutenberg. i really do.    urlLink cjc  has an interesting school magazine thing. you should read one of those. the most memorable one, of course, is 2T30's class motto: Prevent Further Reduction In Head Count. wonder what that means, eh. K had better appear on my messenging software now. appear! and bring oranges. i am becoming exceedingly good at ordering people, and this row of people shall have their fates decided at the whim of a screw-like-head headless hammerhead shark.  nyahahahahaha!!!

       herbal drops  i'm listening to  urlLink brian eno 's two landmark rock albums... with synthesisers and instrumentals and pianos and samples. pishhhhhh.   almost everyone seems to think that i had a hand in a really good number of rhymes from kee to his bob friend, and despite my repeated insistence that i respect the idea of poetry: it must be, above all, neither overly cooked nor vague to the point of coherence. and my supposed work fails in that regard. if it were something of a classic i would have by no means restrained myself from admitting i wrote it and all of shakespeare's work for that stupid freeloading bastard, and unfortunately that is not the case.  i e-mailed this to a mentor:  "the essential scope of bertrand russell's work on human beliefs spans across two main themes: one is that the foolish man is too cocksure and the second is that the perfect belief system has a method for self-evaluation, self-doubt and co-existance with science. and, yes, i readily admit that russell has defined the stupid man, but i think the smart man is one who has, for all intents and purposes, guided a man into the Russell junction of doubt and sureness. but defining the ethically undesirable man lies almost along the same lines, and it is important to make a distinction here: he is one who misguides another into the Russell junction."    and i have done that, of course, but only because i am that ethically undesirable. i mean, yes, since i constantly talk about Brother Paul stalking students everywhere and laughing at them with an ingenious self-invented cackle and of magical fairies that watch MTV (and yes, the only abbreviation i know of in popular entertainment today) periodically. but nothing along the lines of what our  urlLink dope driven, insanely curious  smartie friend  hitler  heather has got here. good night.

       pick up  a set of lecture notes on the fundamentals of optics: "optics is a discipline that appears to have found the secret of eternal life... lasers, a solution without a problem in my youth, are now (among other things) making extraordinary advances in basic physics."  spent the morning on physics questions that i will never get to see in an O Level exam. that is damned stupid. but as both misters foo and tay will say, it's good practise. why prepare for something that is two years ahead when you can prepare four years ahead? forethought! like john cleese in the "self defence against fresh fruit" sketch, you must have a sixteen tonne weight ready at all times.  on to more important things. "sketch" or "skit"? if i'm not wrong, a sketch usually has only one scene. a skit is more general but most probably implies a work of an amateur. but that's only my interpretation, i am probably wrong in any case. okay. bye.

       felt tip  my condition is getting worse. not only has the tonsilitis overcome my powers of speech, it has given me a few truckloads of voice breaks. the only words i can utter now are probably, say, ten zillion octaves lower than that sickening  urlLink B-flat  black hole. then i start choking on the phlegm.   not that i don't want to go to school for another round of boring lessons until 3pm, then to maya's to insult his battered ego, and back home to a warm, comfortable nest... but... i'm on a bloody MC until wednesday. wednesday inclusive, actually. which is just as well, since i can't really talk now. my only forms of communication with the human world are as follows: throat clearing noises, spitting noises, and whistling. i kid you not, my friends: with stupid tonsils that have been inflamed beyond control by the SCDF, i can still whistle. phhhweeet. phweeeet.   and i love slugs. ah never mind. good night.

       free to go  i might be battling a fever, a very painful throat, and tonnes of disgusting looking phlegm that blocks my breathing from time to time, but it doesn't mean i can read the interview on SM lee. didn't expect the SM to be an  urlLink agnostic ... which is a good thing to be if you're a politician. (here is  urlLink an entire webpage of quotes explaining why .) but why the heck would you dedicate half the newspaper to this 80 year old man? i doubt even the american journal of physics would do the same for einstein...   i think my mother is trying to kill me. she asked me to eat some ice-cream, fruit juice, and this very bland porridge. for dinner i'm going to have... um... instant noodles. what a great diet for a sick boy. no. burger. what am i doing. they say that a cup of tea + honey is good for a sore throat. i'm listening to acid jazz on internet radio now. mmm. bobbling waves of keyboards, electronic bleeps & the occasional classical guitar. & sometimes overbearing percussion. always good for you.   dinner time. bye.

       cakes  i'm doing the biology mcq test now. ah, the life. i am sick, and i have a sore throat from eating too much of those tasty cheese+greentea mooncakes. the physics mcq tests have expired, biology ones expire tomorrow, and our darling mrs khoo extended the chemistry ones to monday. hoorah for procrastinators!  at my leisure, i say: the professor.com.sg site addresses me as "doctor". blimey sweetcakes! and time to mug for the exams or something. or play games and mug at the same time. that's hardly possible.   and again, i hate swallowing panadol pills. my poor, aching throat has got to entertain one of those bitter discs every four hours or so. and water. cooling water makes one sleepy...

      i will not be able to use this MSN messenger thing  urlLink from october 15 , because apparently they're shutting off the connection to the MSN client i use on my mac. this essentially means that users who can, in fact, log in after that period may  urlLink have to pay  at the liberty of bill gates and his evil cronies.   so maybe on october 15, we'll talk... not on MSN. maybe AOL or ICQ. we'll see.  on the other hand, i really really really hate biology. it's a very evil subject. okay. bye.

      ah. we butchered a pig's heart today. our one had a thick clot at the bicuspid valve. sometimes when you think biology is a total waste of time (sometimes i do, of course, since i don't quite like memorising things - kenn's favourite activity) you get to, um, express your artistic intentions through the means of something that once existed. an ex-pig, in this case.   but its spirit lives within us. for the sake of the education of a bunch of hooligans with nothing to offer to the country apart from total chaos, the pig has made a noble sacrifice indeed.

      the holy grail to my "monty python and the holy grail vcd": an A1 for english, which is impossible because for  three  straight examinations, the highest in english got an A2, but mostly because the person is... preferred. and the most brutal marker in school -- my english teacher -- is now responsible for dispensing twenty-five sympathy summary marks from the comprehension section. repeat after me:  one mark for no indentation, half mark per word over the limit (half mark for two words if you counted wrongly -- excess or deficit), one mark for no question numbers, just about half the style marks deducted for more than 3 points not properly written in own words (which cy pointed out after having a look one day)...  you can just about see our prospects for a pass. and do not discount the fact that most of us don't knows the plurals of a "grand prix".  but  anyway  i showed mrs khoo (rgs extraordinaire) kenn's amazing chemistry question, which she tried to avoid by keeping order in the class --  a rare occurance. and she kind of dismissed it saying that it was a "maths question", which kenji loves a lot (maths questions, i mean). and well, mrs khoo, i honestly don't really care too much if you major in maths, chemistry or dressing up like an air stewardess of a budget airline that lives up to its name... just do the question and we'll all magically ace the exams. really.  and the word "mindset" is just wrong. why do we have to lift everything from US shores? huh huh huh? all right. bye.

      some quotes:  the local actress embroiled in the slimming pill saga (on tv a while ago): "...it's been a wonderful game". (not to mention, she was gushing away over her new million dollar windfall. but, ma'am, the battle's just started...)  cy on lynette, who met her with a boyfriend and a new attitude to boot: "it pounds my heart to pity her, but it costs nothing to envy her pennies." (new boyfriend = gold mine. it sounds offensive, i know. maybe she meant something else.)  gw bush in a dramatic turnaround: "saddam hussein deceived the world." (that adds a word to his vocabulary.)  and... and... i just hate this biology business. why can't bio be more like social studies / history: four lines of obviousness + two lines conclusion and clinch something like full marks. which is exactly my kind.   mr foo said that the MOE sends our school some letters every year because there is large grade differences between our school's preliminary examination marks for  every bloody department in this graveyard  except the china one (maybe they speak a different language and work differently) and the o level marks: they already get miffed when the school standard is 2 grades higher than the o levels. and guess what: for the past five years we've been 3 to 4 grades worse for physics in the prelims than our normal o level standards. and now our school is now making us solve logarithmic equations for the end of the year physics paper. good luck if you're from maris stella, i guess.   ah. ok. have to work at cardiac graphs. ms fong stole the last 3 days of revision to teach a topic she thinks will come out right on our damn year just because it came out for ONE mcq question in the last ten years. good call...

      alain prost  urlLink on ayrton senna , probably the greatest F1 driver of all time: "even in that Mercedes touring car race, back in '84, I realised that he wasn't interested in beating Alan Jones or Keke Rosberg or anyone else - it was me, just me, for some reason [...] still, even as it turned out, it was a fantastic story, don't you think? and I think, in a way, we're missing a little of that today."   i think i might scrap  urlLink the Novel  and start over. which is, um, very characteristic of me because i am hardly satisfied with anything i do, and the fact that maybe writing in first person wasn't such a brilliant idea after all. write in third person, establish more views, and fuck the cliches. that would be better. so word count: from 2673 to 0. i was actually due to start on the first of november anyway. now i've got to start on a fresh sheet of mindmaps, outlines & scene diagrams (too complicated to explain the finer workings of the latter). ping!  oh and how i miss all of you who still use msn or something. jt for conversations with at least six mentions of the totally bizarre, hon, and pe for being all too good. and jeremy who is very interested in idle issues, and mohawk who is scared of jeremy to bits, and kee wen who cannot spell the word "apology". the two sngs nerds i know were also fun to talk to in equal bits, except that i think marbleeyes is... un fun and nerdy and all that. and most of all, of course, i miss my big crush from scgs (let's call her A), who likes instead fellow churchgoing captain of the ACSI canoeing team (source: the very reliable ms khoo) although i have personally sworn to smash his head with a big, hot frying pan.  at least i have cy to talk to on icq, which isn't that bad because that's one person who you can learn lots from, and also that she now refuses to communicate with her steady through the internet because she thinks he's a microsoft whore, which leaves her this alien to talk to for half the day.   see you at mcdonald's tomorrow. i'll be camping there with my laptop to work on the Novel. bye.

      i'm  urlLink writing a novel  now. (plots and everything had been decided upon a long time ago.) it's tentatively called, um, "the winds of change". a semi-fictional story, actually. here's a little excerpt of what i was writing just now:    do not mistake me. i like girls very much [...] but there are times that give me a certain impulse to lust after inanimate objects such as rocks and leaves rather than girls, and school mornings are very trying times.    yeh. a novella about a sex-deprived kid who lives opposite a girls' school on exam day, and how an event changes his life forever (no, not getting a girlfriend, that would be shallow). hence winds of change. i expect there to be a lot of wind talk, of course, because i like winds a lot. anyone interested in writing a novella with me? 50 000 words. we'll do it just fine. in fact the other one i'll write about will be about calculators. much crap about butterflies and bull intestines. yum. bye.

      one: i am on icq at 174181650, and on aol im as 'simianwarhero'. if you need a shoulder to cry on, a deposit for your hate, and a place to send free coffee sachets, try your luck. or maybe if you really miss me because microsoft is so determined to shut out users of its (admittedly) quite good chat protocol -- but only if because so many of its useless features are cut out for my msn software that it begins to look functional and useful for a while.   two: listening to radiohead, godspeed you black emperor, the microphones, david byrne (!), brian eno. the usuals, that is. but i'm begininng to discover david byrne, who's got too much pop sensibilities. too much. and enough string sections to scare the godspeed people far and away. and what happened to hip-hop?   three: oh, oh, oh. i am tired. i hope my father bought canned chicken curry. otherwise it's boiled egg tonight. woo.   four: oks' birthday is on the twenty fifth. i think. and i owe him three drumsticks, a year overdue... just because i kind of forgot last year. i'll give him two egg tarts instead. or one digusting fish burger. but don't get mistaken: i love egg tarts. those they sell in my school just suck. phissshhhhh.   five: how come i can solve  urlLink this  and not  the  question? damnation. bye

      brian eno in an  urlLink interview : In cities, you have the opportunity to do all the things that women are really specialized at: intense social relationships and interactions, attention to lots of simultaneous details. And of course in cities you can do very few of the things that men are good at -- you can’t break anything in a city.  anyway, i almost got a damned chunlong haircut. i mean i bloody did, of course, but having looked at myself for the last ten minutes of the cut weirdly i realised i looked a little, um, chunlong-ish, so i decided to have it trimmed further. any more and i would have kokpin's cut. isn't that great or what.  and poor old darling al still hates me, i bet. not that i expect her to like me over a canoeing captain, but still... don't torture me, you know? my brains are soft, watery and pulpy. any more of this mushiness and i will most certainly bury myself under some good plaster of paris. and shiqi, being the great sport that she has always been, still refuses to tell me anything. still. i couldn't have pried something like one of these mugs of chocolate chip ice cream from her cold, dead hands, not even with a big spanner. oh al oh al. i am, um, hurting. maybe after this mug of ice cream, i swear i will hurt.  i won at scrabble today with ERUDITE, THEOLOGY and INHIBITED (that's nine letters, for the astute). no doubt you must have incredible respect for me. my streak of eight letter words is fantastic, i tell you. in fact i've rewarded myself with a pair of speakers that grace either side of my bed. every night this software thing will programme the playlist of the night and for it to shut down by 2.30am and i just go to sleep with gastr del sol plucking away by my ears. nice. 2.30am, of course, is usually a lie. but then again i have no one to talk to at 2.30am these days, except cy if she's upset or what. no doubt she hates losing at scrabble. time to go declare war on my maid. bye.

      ah, how nice of some people. jeremy's friend charmaine has the distinction of being only the second person to email me within, i believe, the last five days. and N can just, um, dig a hole and swallow all the soil he's dug up or something.   david has very, very sublime stories but he does not want me to share them because he is shy. but it is a pity because they are very good. almost, in fact, as good as cy. she sucks at all those dungeons and monsters stuff though. but she can whip up a mean story on retribution, tradition, religion and sex and all that, which happens to be catherine lim's backyard, i believe.   heather, all mighty with regards to the bizarre, is a  urlLink better writer than a poet . but maybe some of these weren't meant to be poems at all. that aside, occasionally brilliant writing. exactly like a radiohead record, actually: it always ends rather great. maybe except their straight-out-rock albums. the one on thom, in fact, reminds me of radiohead's "backdrifts", a kind of nice song about hopelessness, crumbling shortbread and gargling tea. (all british songs are tributes to tea.)    to this end, i actually have my own stories, but i'm waiting for kelly to design the template for me first. although she makes me check her own essays for grammatical errors and expects, um, very lenient critiques, which i can dispense i suppose.   i like gastr del sol's camoufleur (a brilliant album i got from a great pal) very much. most of the tracks are kind of aimless but effortless and beautiful for four minutes, but a one point five minute climax that makes it all the worthwhile. it's like a beautiful moment where you're on the verge on sinking into a most wonderful little dream, you're floating... and by the time music starts to fade out you have lost all mortal contact for the next few hours. i love it. with grape juice and shortbread fingers and a lot of imagination. sorry, i am being digressive again. but if you ever get your hands on it, maybe you ought to give it a listen. just skip the rock track.

      jim o'rourke in typical morbid, cheeky style: "Women look good in, with men’s clothes on / It contains them / Men look good in, with women’s clothes on / It betrays them." (lyrics from modern rock's (or laptop rock) second best lyricist. which kind of sucks, but compare to linkin park in cy's ever eloquent ways: " urlLink challenging -- and beating -- the intelligence quotient of more than a million people a day. " and no, off-kilter grammar aside, i am saying nothing.)  needless to say, i lost to cy at scrabble, despite four eight letter words (and a 200-point windfall) in one game (i lost by an agonising one point). cy is just too good at this thing. she got MORIBUND and PHYSICAL out of nowhere in the last stages of that particular game. i got UPRIGHTS, ERECTION and WARHEAD in three consecutive turns, with three of the six Rs and hence destroying my chances of winning with a related word like ROBERT. i rulez. it's like my fifa 2003 game: twenty shots on target, five shots that smacked the uprights (with a very, very detectable relish by my team's HOME crowd), and zero goals. shut up. my inspiration comes from monty python's eric idle's  urlLink penis song . and no, don't ask why. just grin and bear with it.   lessons as usual next week. which impedes with revision for my aptitude tests next saturday. and of course you don't need revision for aptitude tests because none of what you have learnt in the past 15 years will actually be tested. but i actually have some articles on the greatest chess player (or at least, "a guy who won six amateurs simultaneously while blindfolded", i am not lying to you) paul morphy. but all geniuses are inherently assholes, like bobby fischer. now that's one big asshole.   fischer: "i want a prompt, direct, specific, straightforward and unequivocal faxed answer to this question."  storage company: "the direct, specific, straightforward and unequivocal answer is no."  fischer (in reply): "instead of answering my clear, simple and extremely pertinent question you insist on falsely restating my question and then answering with your own false restatement!" (goes on to ask the earlier first question. this is posed in addition to about 3/4 page describing the contents of a previously faxed document.)  storage company: "the direct, specific, straightforward and unequivocal answer is no."  and so on. bye.

      professor robert jensen  urlLink on religious cults : "I think absolute certainty is dangerous."  einstein the agnostic: "my religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality." (other notable agnostics include hemingway, sagan, charles schulz, george soros, charles darwin and closer to our shores senior minister lee k.y., although i wouldn't really want to give him a standing ovation like 6000 people did at the NDP.   for dinner, i had this dish called nasi ulam [rice salad? is this translation right?] which involves sprinkling some of this fried brown stuff over rice fried with dried prawns and onions and a sprig of leaf that i cannot identify. (yet.) and it tastes quite good actually with lots of lashings of chilli, like all peranakan fare. and i tried adding half a teaspoon of sesame oil to it with not much effect. tastes just good with sparkling grape juice, or if you don't have that then a nice mug of cool, slightly diluted guava juice will be just fine. but it has to be cool.   i completely demolished cy at scrabble five times in a row. bam bam bam. i was trailing by 20 close to the end of one, but... triple word score + eight letter word. quixotic => 10 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 26. 26*3=78. 78 + 50 point bonus = 128. emurocks => infinite. go away.

      i have done about three quarters of my favourite physics puzzle book. which is really nice, because it is only now and then that you get the "i want to solve these unsolvable puzzles" feeling and you do so and get them right. and for a 12 hour stretch, too. but not now. great preparation for an upcoming aptitude test. (nothing to do with the NUS school, just something i am doing for fun...)  and the novel is, um, quite started. now it feels like i spoonfed it too much. i bet i'll give up in ten days because i'm stupid, and it's still five days plenty. and is there any outlining software on windows that is rather easy to use (like  urlLink omnioutliner  on the mac or something) because quite stunningly PK cannot access my omnioutliner files, so i might be forced to use this pc thing. the only substitute i've found is this treepad thing, which has about one hectazillion things that i don't really care for. and i hope i don't have to resort to  urlLink radio userland  (which i like, but i get easily sidetracked by current affairs :-)  and oh, i haven't been to maya's class in a month. i think i'm returning on thursday to make his life a miserable one.   and just to gloat over this: i actually got the  urlLink stupid question ... two decimal places off. (but it was calculator-solved, mind you) and  urlLink this one . but only 2. out of... fifty. ok damn. bye.

      i lost at scrabble today. that ends my winning streak doesn't it.  anyway , every dog (and every female dog) has its day, and cy  will  in fact retire into a nice, orange sunset and bloody fry or something. sizzle. i am not past my prime yet. in fact, i don't think i've even started escalating the ladder of greatness yet, and i'm already winning at scrabble. so there you go. i'll be frying the bacon tomorrow, my dear boiled chihuahua.   ah, the wonders of living next to the road. if i had a camera, i would take this very fascinating picture of a road chase between a pillion rider and a very, very aggressive poilce motorcycle. i mean, of course, justice always does the chasing.   anyway, anyway, anyway: kenn looks far too serious when he's playing cards, which is really rather because he's already living his life as an adult at the very mature age of 15. and of course, it's also possible to be very serious in an adult way about games where you fire little cannonballs or bullets or watermelons or something and games where you breed virtual pets and so forth. all growing up, aren't we?   for anyone who desires to be just like kenn, spiritual advisor of the twenty first century, here's a guide: 1. purchase a year's supply of cards. (that is exactly one pack, which is plenty in my opinion.) 2. take exactly one card and stare at it for about 36 hours or so as if it were a deer you are going to hunt so you can get its meat and sell, probably for a profit. (commerce and trading are, of course, very adult things here. and venison is also a very man food, so change this to about a tonne of trout if you are female, if so desired, or else you will grow an extra leg. this is, from what i notice from some PLMGSS girls in the morning, one of their finer ambitions in life.) 3. try not to laugh at yourself for being a complete ass. 4. congratulations. you now understand what it is to be a real man/woman/some combination of both, but surely not a kid like the rest of your fellow 15 year olds. they all suck. they are creeps and kiddy creatures who deserve to suck their milk bottles, choke, die and then rot anywhere outside five kilometres from your residence.  hooray for kenn, the new spiritual primate advisor of the 21st century. he'll lead us down the glorious path of capitalism, globalisation (although strictly speaking this is already an unstoppable juggernaut, just ask an iraqi), card games, and breeding of online pets and the like.  anyway, i  am  going to thrash cy at scrabble. some day i will. just you wait and see. in fact if all doesn't work out right i'll hire sik hui to do something, like steal cy's hair for himself, and i'll bet $40 she'll bawl her head off. tee hee hee. okay later people. good bye!

(in fact, it was his own sec 3 class but he had, um, hijacked it to coach some students again.) but anyway, life sucks. i am still doing the puzzles, still winning tremendously at scrabble and still the total asshole that i was not 24 hours ago.   there's the 3 hour social studies lecture tomorrow. i wonder why they bother. but it would be good as always to concentrate 400 of us in one small sports hall thing and torture us with death threats, stones and of course the Stuffy Air. they don't bother to air condition anything in the school, do they. except the teachers' lounge, the staff rooms and the whole of our brothers' humble abode. they really deserve it for all the hard work that they put in. not to mention: the teachers in my school never put up airs, never scold us for no rhyme or reason, never shout and yell at us. heck, they even deliver the morning newspapers to our doors every morning, if that's what you want to know.   not that we are a terribly angelic lot either. if i were to give you a little percentage chart of the types of students in school, 5% are studious, the next 20% are not that studious but do acceptably well, 40% are so-so, another 20% don't really give a damn any more, and the rest don't even know they exist. they're zombies. i swear that you can actually see it in their eyes, like sleeping fish. (fish have no eyelids.) so yes, i am looking forward to the lecture by some of singapore's  finest  teachers. didn't you know that huh huh huh huh.

      i squandered the entire afternoon reading up on, um, asian political leaders. which is a very fun topic to read. i came across some short writeups of some asian leaders and so on: they are featured under the time 100 list. emperor hirohito, sukarno, and one written by  urlLink mao zedong's english teacher . probably a 30 minute read. it's worth the time reading through the list, in particular rabindranath tagore (the first asian nobel laureate for literature!) and hirohito. there's also one on lee kuan yew.  sylvia pek, a local phd maths student studying in U of michigan: "But to the Peranakans, dressing in Malay-Chinese-Indian-British influenced fashion, living in a house roofed with intricate Chinese tiles and supported on stilts of Malay fishermen' s houses,  drinking tea out of British teacups  is an absolutely normal way of life." (now you know why. it's in my genes.)  i am losing to that nerd again at the puzzles. he solved 3 subquestions, and i have done the same for 2. out of 98 questions. oh yes. king of the world.   and normal lessons as usual tomorrow. what the heck!

      daryl and co have decided that we should get a football jersey of our own. i bet we'd call our team "suckerfish". at least, that's what khairul would call it. actually i'd like something like dark green + black. no orange please. and i need proper boots.  & mmmmm i love salmon. mmmm. smoked salmon. and you may not really agree with me, but as someone who can touch type i really want to outfit my laptop with  urlLink one of these keyboards .  back to work.

      do you know how it pounds below? they, not it; they are defanging the ground of precious green friends and the concrete inhabitants literally pour in. my spirits were, of course, hardly dampened: in only six months i'll have lifts that i don't really care for although they stop at every floor and serve breakfast in the mornings and i would ask natalie for two hard boiled eggs and she would rush in with the requisites: coffee and no sugar in it, the eggs, layers of dry, toast bread that make delightful scrubbing sounds as they rub the adjacent, and the odd crumb on my bed and natalie would rush in with a napkin to sweep the intruding ant attractions and i would tell her screw the blasted things just sit here next to me and let's watch the world morph into white, blue and those blasted noisy whirring machines building our lifts hell forced up their sufficiently tight rectums and they would scream as a rotten strawberry would as it has its sour red flesh chomped off by the desperate big yellow chips  of a starving man by the street just a few blocks away.  and my dear natalie would just melt away into the abyss, except that it isn't really one, since she's got to fall into it and make loud unnecessary screaming noises as girls do so she just disappears and resumes being a cross between an aloof housewife and one of those english housekeepers; they wear some headgear device, something like a crown of feathers -- also akin to that of a hen's.   modern shakespeare for you. the old bugger, as expected, was never daring enough to pop a few expletives into his work, but his clues were never subtle either. good bye.

      biology lecture, then to marine parade library. i read, um, almost half of one of "a farewell to arms" (1/4 in the library, 1/4 on the homeward bus)... yes, it's a damned love novel. but if i were to recommend two out of all the hemingway books i've read (about  urlLink eighty percent of this list ) then my favourite three would be green hills of africa, garden of eden and for whom the bell tolls. and if you like the occasional challenge to the olfactory department then the old man and the sea would be good as well. (i like fish. yeah i do. i sure do.) but there's this weighty tinge of his words, surely more than when he was talking about blood dripping down from a dying man in very sick, foreboding stream, that kind of ruins the highty flighty hemingway spirit of it all. sorry about that, i am talking nonsense again.   and although i am quite indifferent to animal farm, i'd recommend it over harry potter any day for  just   urlLink the last paragraph . would have been a fun book to do for lit in sec 1 or sec 2, if they hadn't decided to make us do one on some american gangsters. how nice, american gangsters. i thought enough of our school are americanised chinese gangsters, but apparently we haven't had enough.  anyway, thanks to the nice fellow who vandalised one of the library books i'm working through now. you're a saviour. you really are. i'm being mean just saying this, but i hope you didn't make it to a university. hmmmph i am just fuming now.   damn. when i'm angry i need some sparkling grape juice and sigur ros at my speakers. farewell.

      a friend asked for my top ten monty python moments, which i can fill easily with maybe just two episodes, but i've watched about ten or so -- which is too much. of course, presenting them in text does no justice compared to seeing it on your own. anyway, here they are in no particular order:   ten: "All through the winter of '43 we had translators working, in joke-proof conditions, to try and produce a German version of the joke. They worked on one word each for greater safety. One of them saw two words of the joke and spent several weeks in hospital. But apart from that things went pretty quickly, and we soon had the joke by January, in a form which our troops couldn't understand but which the Germans could."   nine:  Accountant:  	Lady Chairman, sir, shareholders, ladies and gentlemen. I have great pleasure in announcing that owing to a cutback on surplus expenditure of twelve million Canadian dollars, plus a refund of seven and a half million Deutschmarks from the Swiss branch, and in addition adding the debenture preference stock of the three and three quarter million to the directors' reserve currency account of seven and a half million, plus an upward expenditure margin of eleven and a half thousand lira, due to a rise in capital investment of ten million pounds,  this firm last year made a complete profit of a shilling .  Chairman: 	A shilling Wilkins?  Accountant: 	Er, roughly, yes sir.  Chairman:	Wilkins, I am the Chairman of a multi-million pound corporation and you are a very new chartered Accountant. Isn't it possible there may have been some mistake?  Accountant: 	Well that's very kind of you sir, but I don't think I'm ready to be Chairman yet.  Board Member: 	Wilkins, Wilkins. This shilling, is it net or gross?  Accountant: 	It's British sir.  Chairman: 	Yes, has tax been paid on it?  Accountant: 	Yes, this is after tax. Owing to the rigorous bite of the income tax five pence of a further sixpence was swallowed up in tax.  Board Member: 	Five pence of a further sixpence?  Accountant: 	(eagerly) Yes sir.  Chairman: 	Five pence of a further sixpence?  Accountant: 	That's right sir.  Chairman: 	Then where is the other penny?  Accountant: 	... Er.  Board Member: 	That makes you a penny short Wilkins. Where is it?  Accountant: 	... Erm.  Chairman: 	Wilkins?  Accountant: 	(in tears) I embezzled it sir.   eight: 	This is a frightened city. Over these houses, over these streets hangs a pall of fear. Fear of a new kind of violence which is terrorizing the city. Yes, gangs of old ladies attacking defenseless, fit young men.  seven: dinsdale sketch.  Vince: 	Yeah.....after that I used to go round his flat every Sunday lunchtime to apologize and we'd shake hands and then he'd nail my head to the floor.  Interviewer: 	Every Sunday?  Vince: 	Yeah but he was very reasonable about it. I mean one Sunday when my parents were coming round for tea, I asked him if he'd mind very much not nailing my head to the floor that week and he agreed and just screwed my pelvis to a cake stand.  ...  Gloria: 	I should say not. Dinsdale was a perfectly normal person in every way. Except is as much as he was convinced that he was being watched by a giant hedgehog whom he referred to as Spiny Norman.  Interviewer: 	How big was Norman supposed to be?  Gloria: 	Normally he was wont to be about twelve feet from nose to tail, but when Dinsdale was very depressed Norman could be anything up to eight hundred yards long. When Norman was about, Dinsdale would go very quiet and his nose would swell up and his teeth would start moving about and he'd become very violent and claim that he'd laid Stanley Baldwin (british pm in the 1920s). Dinsdale was a gentleman. And what's more he knew how to treat a female impersonator.  ...   Vercotti:  	Doug (takes a drink) I was terrified of him. Everyone was terrified of Doug. I've seen grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug. Even Dinsdale was frightened of Doug. Interviewer: 	What did he do? Vercotti:  	He used sarcasm. He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony, metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire.  six:  Vicar:  	It's about this letter you sent me regarding my insurance claim.  Devious: 	Oh, yeah, yeah - well, you see, it's just that we're not...as yet...totally satisfied with the grounds of your claim.  Vicar: 	But it says something about filling my mouth in with cement.  Devious: 	Oh well, that's just insurance jargon, you know.  Vicar: 	But my car was hit by a lorry while standing in the garage and you refuse to pay my claim.  Devious: 	(rising and crossing to a filing cabinet) Oh well, reverend Morrison...in your policy...in your policy...(he open the drawer of the filing cabinet and takes out a shabby old sports jacket; he feels in the pocket and pulls out a crumbled dog-eared piece of paper then puts the coat back and shuts the filing cabinet)...here we are. It states quite clearly that no claim you make will be paid.  Vicar: 	Oh dear.  Devious: 	You see, you unfortunately plumped for our 'Neverpay' policy, which, you know, if you never claim is very worthwhile...but you had to claim, and, well, there it is.  Vicar: 	Oh dear, oh dear.  five:  Chemist: Right. I've got some of your prescriptions here. Er, who's got the pox? (nobody reacts) ... Come on, who's got the pox ... come on... (a man timidly puts his hand up) . .. there you go. (throws bottle to the man with his hand up) Who's got a boil on the bum... boil on the botty. (throws bottle to the only man standing up) Who's got the chest rash? (a woman with a large bosom puts up hand) Have to get a bigger bottle. Who's got wind? (throws bottle to a man sitting on his own) Catch.  four: Man: To boost the British economy I'd tax all foreigners living abroad.  three:  Ximinez: So you think you are strong because you can survive the soft cushions. Well, we shall see. Biggles! Put her in the Comfy Chair! (Biggles roughly push her into the comfy chair) Now. You will stay in the Comfy Chair until lunch time, with only a cup of coffee at eleven... (to Biggles) Is that really all it is?  Biggles: Why, yes lord. Ximinez: I see. I suppose we make it worse by shouting a lot, do we? Confess, woman. Confess! Confess! Confess! Confess!  two: SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'JULIUS CAESAR ON AN ALDIS LAMP' Close-up of Caesar walking in Roman street. Soothsayer pushes his way up to him wild eyed and produces Aldis lamp and starts flashing:  SUBTITLE: 'BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH' Some steps at the foot of a statue. Caesar is stabbed. As he falls he brings out a really big Aldis lamp and flashes to the assassins around him.  SUBTITLE: 'ET TU BRUTE'  one: Watkins: 	And grenades, sir. And machine guns, sir. So I'd like to leave, sir, before I get killed, please.  Colonel: 	Watkins, you've only been in the army a day.  Watkins: 	I know sir but people get killed, properly dead, sir, no barley cross fingers, sir. A bloke was telling me, if you're in the army and there's a war you have to go and fight.  Colonel: 	That's true.  Watkins: 	Well I mean, blimey, I mean  if it was a big war somebody could be hurt .  Colonel 	Watkins, why did you join the army?  Watkins: 	For the water-skiing and for the travel, sir. And not for the killing, sir. I asked them to put it on my form, sir - no killing.  Colonel: 	Watkins are you a pacifist?  Watkins: 	 No sir, I'm not a pacifist, sir. I'm a coward.

      ah, what weird things happen. this afternoon a friend of my mother's came to talk because she actually wanted to ask if she could stay here temporarily. she's (the visitor, not my dear mother) is somewhat of a paranoid psycho. she's off her rocker. she thinks everyone, including and  especially  her 80-year-old mother, is conspiring against her. she's a fruitcake! she's a dotty mooner! a loony! her normal mental processes are of interest only for the historians! her sanity has gone to jail! she is an ex-sane being!  mother says that she was from RGS, was real pretty, and all the boys wanted to date her. and i couldn't really tell if she was some kind of a ex-bombshell. and, mind you, she became a teacher (and retired just recently), so she's quite filthy rich from what i hear. and, oh, how time and fate can take its toll. today she's still single, has plenty of pimples and black patches on her face, and is migrating to australia to find true love. but she's still paranoid, and it would be quite infringing on the affairs of her immediate family to tell you about it. (and you would never believe me, anyway, so it's best left unsaid.)  but the moral is that if you're a pretty girl, come from a great school, and have a quadzillion boyfriends, you better not be picky even if you can. or else when you're approaching your dotage you always sense that the walls are closing on you every damn night, an inch at a time. (or grow plenty of pimples, but i swear that's  beside  the point.) like my friend cy, or better yet, my big crush al (to protect her identity, i have only used the first two letters of her name), but al is such a nice girl that such things will never happen to her. but cy, i'm not so sure. HAHAHAHAHAHA. bye bye!

      it came to my attention that my father did see the post about my hip-hop tendencies and so forth on thursday, but i believe that for some reason known only to himself he has not memorised the web address of my blog. (maybe he finds me a stuffy individual.) but he said something like "good, finally making some progress with girls". with a big approving grin. deep down my papa isn't like that, you see, he just tries to accommodate the fact that our values undergo change towards the vulgar. but he said not to say a profanity to a girl.  papa, if you're reading this, you do know that male chivalry died out in the last quarter century. it's really true.   but alice... alice... say the three words i have been trying to gurgle over the phone foaming in the mouth only if my phone line was connected and i paid the phone bills......... and say it to me, not that acs dude with the strong canoeing arms.....................

      nigel and i quarrelled our way through an iphos question in 1.5 hours, no thanks to his extensive probing with calculus. and the cord question also. in fact the cord one has been kind of bugging us for half a week already, but i did get a reasonable looking two step solution. which goes to show that even though you've already learned the entire a maths syllabus by the first semester of upper secondary school, like our nigel has, you may never be able to do even three puzzle questions correctly with calculus and all.   although the word "fuck" is in fact considered to be slang, i do wish to point out that the first recorded use of the word was slightly before 1500, which was before or after columbus found america (1492), but certainly the english speaking american population needs more than just a few years to first adapt the european english before utterly murdering it beyond reason.   and to alice's slightly evangelistic lines, i can only say one thing: i am an  urlLink agnostic , but given that one must never be so sure of absolutely everything (which does include agnosticism; despite it being its central idea), i am always open to your evangelism provided they don't come too thick and fast to utterly confuse me, because i am quite a stupid person. but i refrain from discussing too much about agnosticism for the simple reason that it is obvious and a progression of the natural sciences' instinct to be curious and inquisitive.   i am not anti-american. saying that about me would be absolute nonsense. similarly, a pro-american is not  urlLink someone who gets repeatedly cheated by american companies , knows it, grins and bears it. that kind of tolerance is admirable. that ability to turn an eye knowing full well one is being cheated shows that tolerance. it's like conceiving a son, knowing for sure (maybe you were given a subtle divine clue) that when you are eighty he will just leave you to rot alive in an old folks' home. and obviously, that's why i like a girl like alice: so womanly, so nice, so tolerant. sometimes she's *quite* aggressive, but that happens to all girls routinely. although if we ever have such a demon for a child, at least she has  only me  when we both get feasted on by maggots at the neighbourhood old folks' home when we're eighty and bony and skinny.

      because i am feeling a bit lonely now, i'll reply to the latest onslaught by alice and her friend miss ang:   i am fairly sure that for all alice's english acing credentials are worth, she is quite aware that when i write about "fucking chinese scholars", i used the expletive as a verb. i am a zhong guo ren, of course, just one who isn't too well-versed with the language. but don't go around waving your pet monkey's privates at me: i am quite peranakan. which means that my parents were brought up in an exclusively malay + english environment that, in turn, affected my upbringing. not my fault.   my great grandparents are 100% chinese, i believe. that i never denied.   i even frequently point out on slashdot, of all places, that the chinese economy at its current growth rate will overtake the US by 2041.  in fact when you and me are eighty, alice darling, you'd be buying chinese love songs just because your overlords are now chinese and you'd be doing a happy, sexy (in an old way) hallelujah dance in the streets (slightly shaky, of course, since we'd be eighty)  and i'd be clapping my hands and pouring tea syrup (because maple syrup is western) all over myself because i can't really read the instructions properly.    i didn't generalise about being cheated and such. i am sure greenday is american. i am sure than linkin park is american. and just to test if i'm not a twit, clay aiken is also american, because if he weren't he wouldn't have participated in this american idol thing. don't think i don't know read bbc entertainment, yo nigger.   my school: you're right here. i'm a blemish in a perfect school. i suck.   with respect to my slow emotional growth as a teenager, i find that, well, since you have no doubt read in our local agenda-setting newspapers that even three year olds are displaying signs of purchasing ownership (buying games, harry potter, etc) that in the past have only first presented themselves at teenage. and appropriately, teenagers our age no longer as in the past assert that it's teenage, damn it, but instead try to act all adult and everything and end up  bloating every other girl's tummy across the fucking street  because they think they're so bloody smart with their phds and their toyotas and their linkin park cds and their microsoft computers and their nike shoes (brought to you by a chinese sweatshop) and their nokia handphones. every person i know owns one, except maybe cc.   i thought that since you find "dear" a bit trivial and american then "alice darling", "ali sweetie", "hominy bidet honey" (sounds like a kind of soup) and "frank" (clay aiken has a hedgehog called "frank", and  urlLink clay aiken is no american , no no no) should suffice. and there's also "alicko yo yo yo i luvvvv u baby yo yo yo niggers eat crap and go away from muh alicko", which is more aligned to your american affiliations and "a-li-si wo-ai-ni ni-shi-wo-de-girlfriend" which is a respectful number to hail our collective chinese roots. up to you, anything is fine. they all refer to the same girl i like so much.   i still love you, no matter what. even if you still doggedly like that acs fellow, i will never give up on you. and to the person who got curious and asked the acs guy, just tell him this in nigger language: "you nigger yo yo don't steal muh alicko from muh arms nigger go drink your coffee and flush it down the toilet and  freeze yr head in da freezer yo cos it sure hell stink of fish!!!! !@#!@#!@# "  fuck where the hell did i pull that from. if i continue, this will be a damn classic. i feel so good now. ok bye.

      the chalet -- in simple terms -- was a complete waste of time. but cc and i managed to while about an hour talking about people who i haven't the faintest idea of, and at least i managed to share  urlLink some things i do know  from obsessively reading the bbc. clifton, kee and i were loitering pasir ris at... um... 1.30am, then we had a meal of hk-style fried rice later and everyone destroyed clifton's sparklers. better than watching some horror movie or four boys hog the playstation, bless those fools.  at five thirty in the morning, the few of us who were smart enough to demand a respite from this utter nonsense left for orchard, which proved to be quite a costly mistake because for all the vibrant night life that orchard has even burger king only opens at 7.30am and the old aunties tending the counters were all too eager to aggravate our gastric aches. but that's freedom.   i slept when i came back, so, yes, i will be well awake until the next sunrise.   my dear english-language acing alice wants to  urlLink get involved  in a battle of dignified words with me. lest i remind all of you once again, formalities and dignified words are what make people from my wonderful, brilliant school what they call gentlemen. i never said, however, that one shouldn't indulge in our distinctively local (and embarassing) spoken language. in fact, i can absolutely promise you that i speak in a tone suitable for our youth gangsters about three times a day, and inject more chinese terms in my language than a -- forgive the slang term -- fucking chinese scholar. (if you wish to nitpick, all that a fucking chinese scholar does is moan.) just ask kee wen. your english-laced profanities wouldn't stand a chance.  and yes, i don't have a unique identity, which sucks. but the world needs a few more unique people like you, people who are willing to be champions of american culture, to be cheated by filthy rich music companies to buy albums and so forth, because it is a kind, brilliant, unique person like you who will keep the world (and my humble beating heart) going. thank you, and if you have never heard this in simple terms already, i love you so much. good night!

      i am quite free today to go for the class chalet and freeload on food. at least, i hope those robots bring food.   and while i'm at it i might as well address a recent issue right now: i have no idea what you mean because you insert all kinds of strange americanisms into your diary entries, but i am fairly sure you are trying to degrade me as a person. and for that i have no instinctive defence mechanism whatsoever because i tend to agree: i am, in fact, a blithing hippopotamus who breathes through my anus, and that is why i refuse to grant you any privacy whatsoever.   logically, however, i believe that my method of keeping you in the dark of my intentions was the best way of securing your privacy (and also respecting you); the fact that they leaked out has got little to do with me. i blame the few people who i trust so much to share these feelings with them, and i guarantee you they will see a good round of reprimanding when i ever catch them, those groin smashing bastards.   and i really care about little things like respect. had i not respected the fact that you hate me like a dog hates fleas then i would have done exactly as you had suggested: confront you by phone, personally or by helicopter and scolding you on the spot just to be able to get in touch with you. but i did no such silly thing, if you have some recall. i will never resort to such things.   i never liked you for your tactness, your immaculately poor taste or your inherent disability in spelling the word "paparazzi", and in full acknowledgment that you  may  not (because being absolutely certain is absolutely foolish) have the necessary capabilities to logically interpret my feelings, i will continue to enlighten you as long as my frail self can continue outside the jails of twilight.  in your terms, my dear, yes, you will continue to hear plenty from me in future episodes. cut!

      auuuuu-tohhhh-BANNNNN. excuse me. it's almost twelve, i'm feeling hungry and cranky and no one will make me a hot bowl of porridge so i guess that i'll have to go make one myself. at the start of "autobahn" there's the sound of a car that sounds exactly like a damn datsun. one of those very old ones. they don't creak like most old things do, they rumble like a curmudgeon and threaten to collapse in a whole heap. i was from a very kampung primary school, and our teachers were generally kampung-ish, until they decided to hire a few sluts. in the morning, a cikgu would drive in with his carpark and i'd just beam in approval. but i approved of anything in those times. yes sir, there are some places where you could actually drive an old datsun into without fear of shame.   cy: "the most delightful feeling in the world is to wake up on a slightly frosty morning with your boyfriend licking your toes and feeding you cornflakes and other bite sized fruit slices -- one flake at a time, dear -- and the pillow has the slightest evidence of last night's naughty activity: an undescribable smell that you once deemed absolutely disgusting is now a symbol of fluttering butterflies and hearts struck by cupid arrows and all that romantic nonsense. but all that would be ruined if he weren't doing a perfect mccartney rendition of 'dear prudence'. hehehe!"  me, in response: "the most delightful feeling in the world is to tell someone to fuck off, and he actually does that."  kd, somewhat amused by our exchange: "the most delightful feeling in the world, is to have her [cy] wake up in that room, and have her boyfriend do all those stupid things, and come to realise that her name isn't prudence, and they never had sex either."  cy's boyfriend (whose IRC vernacular has been very much cut down in this edit, thank you very much): wa.... i don't mind..... i'll go book a hotel now.... kekekeke (ewww! what brand of masculinity is that?)  no, um, i better go make myself porridge now.

       urlLink mmm... nerd.  but seriously, how many girls are good at vi and emacs?   expecting mortals?   i have nothing to say now. anyway, i didn't see this until just now:   CHICKEN: HELLO EMU BIRD YOUR DIARY ENTRY IS SO UNORIGINAL BOY ALICE COULD SUE YOU FOR PLAGARISM! CHICKEN: HELLO EMU "COWARDLY" BIRD STOP DISTURBING MY ALICE WITH ALL YOUR WORDS ASSOCIATED WITH HER. IT'S ABSOULTELY GROSTESQUE HOW YOU REFER TO HER AS IF SHE'S YOURS. CHICKEN: EMU BIRD DON'T HIDE CHICKEN: HELLO EMU BIRD I KNOW YOU'RE STILL READING ALICE'S DIARY OH WELL DON'T BE SUCH A COWARD & COME OUT OF YOUR HIDING PLACE!  all i want to say now is, well, no one asked you to be so passionate you know. there's quiet, sincere passion, and there's also this expression i cannot remember wholly offhand, but it goes something like this: "empty barrels make the most noise, and chickens tend to be flea infested birds with no particular sense of direction apart from soiling their butts with excrement".  bye.

       urlLink best analogies ever written : "The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a bowling ball wouldn't."   i hate those fucking puzzles.   bbc reader's comment: "the music industry has to start treating people like they have brains instead of dumping this top 40 pop garbage on us."   a few days ago on slashdot: "i listen to a lot of  urlLink alternative music . it's called  urlLink top 40 . sincerely, the american public."   i met matt at b.k., and he said something stupid in front of his girlfriend. (or maybe not quite his girlfriend, because they weren't already holding hands and all that stupid nonsense and cuddling and saying very mature things to each other.) all i can say is this, birds of the same feather flock together. the  urlLink bird  of  my  dreams hates me because i'm a pagan, and because i like to talk nonsense about how we're going to be ruthlessly abandoned by our children and biting on concrete for our meals.   and maybe it's that i've progressed ever so slightly in years and in centimetres, but i find it better to stay by the sidelines to hide and watch, occasionally hiding behind the fattest tree stump when i'm noticed. i find it better not to torment her and keep her angry, i'll do anything that floats her boat, i guess. call me a failure if you like, but by no means have i given up. i'm just making things more difficult for myself.   but anyway, here's a little survey i scooped up from an obvious source.  I AM: a virgin. I WANT: wealth, power and intelligence. and to be practical.  I HAVE: lots of tea. I WISH: for unlimited wishes.  I HATE: many people.  I MISS: my childhood. no wait, i'm still living it. no. be patient, i doctor, you miss nurse, she nurse your wife. I FEAR: a lot of things, i'm a wimp. I HEAR: immediate radius: brian eno. beyond: ventilation facilities, cars.  I SEARCH: for answers. but really -- more of the time i search for questions. the world's already this fucking complicated, why simplify matters?  I WONDER: if i will ever get to see penguins mate.  I REGRET: that i regret at all.  I LOVE: almost all the people who hate me. and almost none of the people who love me. that's the world for you.  I ACHE: when I over-exert myself I ALWAYS: make life hard for others.  I AM NOT: a lion, a flying creature of any sort, or a circus animal.  I DANCE: U PAY (me, preferably) I SING: not really.  I CRY:  urlLink tens of times a minute.   (i have no rough figures, actually, it varies from about 5 to 70 bpm.) I AM NOT ALWAYS: a walrus. I WRITE: everywhere. including my pencil case. I LOSE: my virginity. hopefully soon. that's what every teen hopes for. I CONFUSE: with confusing words. I NEED: a girl. that's what every male teen wants, too, but i guess all i want is a lot of money for now.  I SHOULD: conquer the universe. clear up my room, wash the dishes, and drink less tea.

      ah, it was so fun today. khairul + daryl + isaiah and myself went to make football jerseys at peninsula plaza, which resulted in our walking back and forth mocking shop signs. eventually we bought orange nike jerseys (that resemble holland's) for about $40, names and numbers included. of course, there is the number 99 khairulz, the number 88 zayer, number 55 (myself) and number 20 daryl. we're buying shorts separately.   we eventually decided to eat at junction 8. then i believe we went to walk to sim lim or something, from raffles city. we went somewhere near waterloo centre or waterloo plaza and then near fullerton or something and then we tried to walk to chinatown (we asked a trishawman for directions and it got him a bit cracked up). i don't know where the hell we went, but i remember that when we took a bus to dhoby ghaut it went around the circle road outside suntec and went back to exactly where we had spent most of the afternoon walking. and the fact that peninsula plaza, which is near city hall mrt, is a stop away from dhoby ghaut... that alone makes wonders. you can actually spend four hours walking round after round over that stupid area and end up... not that far away. we could've gone to see the singapore river if we had a better sense of direction, or spent meaningful time reading at the library... later we went to harbourfront mcdonald's to eat because khairul's fast was over so he could have a decent meal.   but it was fun, you know. catching up on old times as we paced in loops. how we crawled up drains and everything, kicked pong pong fruits, threw milk packets, and myself having poured too much detergent into the school pond. i'd give a front tooth to wreck havoc again.   on thursday we're going to have the finest football jerseys in sg, and our captain zayer leading the charge. and we're going to watch movies, although i care little about movies. (they suck.) today was team suckerfish's first outing and counting. maybe next time we'll walk to mongolia. who knows. ah, well. time to do something to myself. bye.

(i am the only durian hater in the family, apart from myself. i defy sense.) what can be worse.   gurgle. i am bath-deprived, and bathing now, i guess, is a sure fire way to get a bad cold in this kind of weather.   and when are we going to buy jerseys??? i already have my number+name booked: either 55 (suckerfish), 22 (oodie) or 58 (robert). or 76 (sik hui), but i could get into trouble walking around orchard in that. off to get sick. bye

      eh well. it's nice to see daylight morph on your ceiling, really. i couldn't sleep, you see, so i just lay on my back watching the ceiling change colour. i forgot the word i was thinking of... trans something. ah. trans fatty acid. be fair.   eric idle almost got laid. right, and i bathed in goat's milk. actually, quite close. i have this shower foam at home that is goat's milk and honey, which i have tried to avoid because goats eat everything, really, who knows what the milk smells like! but i'm a convert: it smells quite decent actually. i think if you actually bathed in those concentrate you could solve body odour problems in no time.   yes, so it's midnight. and i came to the concession this morning that i should really get cracking on working on impending exams, not sleeping at 4am every morning, and to wake up every morning to a sunrise. which is impressionably noble and all that, so i must go and sleep right this moment, my friends.  after  my last mug of grape juice. i am getting a sore throat from all that drinking.    and kee wen: when do you want to go pay the fees? pick a day this week, it's administrative week. time to fund the spherical bastards, milk the scapegoats and feast on cockroach salads. thankfully, i am vegetarian, or i plan to be, especially since i saw the maid brutalise the carcass of a crab to produce so little meat a cockroach couldn't live in it.

      yesterday was fun, dood. kee wen and i walked for what must have been kilometres up grange road to some stupid building just to pay up. and then it rained. blah blah.   a smart person once said that "christmas is the time where people of all race and religion come together to worship jesus".   cy couldn't help but discolour when she saw this monty python episode with a  urlLink sketch on beethoven . or at least, probably when beethoven (with caricatured frazzled hair) told his wife to "stuff the jam spoon" (interpretation yours) and to "buzz off and shut up" (not too nice a man, is he). and of course, for some reason, the word "bugger" (verb: sodomy; noun: sod) is a strong word to use on bbc tv. or at least in the seventies. all this when nudity and the use of words ruder than "bugger" are more than allowed, anyway. john cleese has a million brilliant ways to say "shut up", but i have to say that the american accent he tried out on "the meaning of life" completely sucks.   and carol "cleavage" cleveland is yummy. quite, anyway.   alice goes philosophical. which is good, really, but fifteen years old is too young an age to take yourself seriously. cough.

      i knew it: ok computer is pitchfork's number one album of the 1990s. fine. flaming lips at #3 and dj shadow is #7. fine. and no white stripes (whew). okay. but no gastr del sol? how fair.   -edit- sorry for the very horrible grammar. i am rather famous for having poor grammar, if you don't mind me. but employing daft tactics with your parents, i am afraid, is one of few good ways to live life the way you want it. but seriously, we have no pastries at home to go with a whole new box of jap green tea (i am not acquainted with brands, of course).   scrabble partner and i quit after i won for two straight games to finish watching monty python's meaning of life. surely among all their movies there isn't one with a greater capacity to offend and to insert stupid jokes every few lines (or whole scenes, really, which is typical of them). in one, um, some guy is in a battlefield with a subordinate who bought (and presented to him on the battlefield itself) two clocks and a cake (he made it himself from sixty days of rations). and a cheque. in another, the python simultaneously make fun of the catholics and the protestants, and there is also one of a waiter who asks the cameraman to follow him for miles just to be told in the end to fuck off. and there's a man who is sentenced to death for cracking a stupid sexist joke in a motion picture, or something like that, and he's sort of chased by tens of women without their tops (before finally falling off a cliff into his grave). yes sir, nude to the flesh. but only waist up, and you can actually see 'em bouncing up and down.   my favourite, apart from the one where they are reciting nonsensical prayers in the chapel, is the one where the headmaster is teaching a sex class. (he is teaching foreplay.) yes. and there is also a full demonstration but they only filmed the head and shoulders of our fearless protagonists. and all of the students, um, don't *quite* like the lessons. hell, you should look at their lifeless expressions. hahahaha.   if you actually don't believe  urlLink all of this happened  in that particular movie, then i guess you haven't heard that in the holy grail movie all the knights gallop around without a horse and there's a kind of helper (who doesn't even wear a horse suit to keep up appearances, if you don't know that) behind him who claps two coconut husks together to make the galloping sound, which is quite genius.   anyway, i have to go. bye.

       urlLink seatle post intelligencer : "According to the findings, the more biased people are, the more their brain power is taxed by contact with someone of another race, as they struggle not to say or do anything offensive. The effect is so strong, the team found, that even a five-minute conversation with a black person left some of the white subjects unable to perform well on a test of cognitive ability."  i've got a question: is a prejudiced person naturally dumb? or does prejudice make you dumb? keep in mind that bobby fischer is an anti-semite, and winston churchill was a misogynist. whether winston churchill was a certified genius is hard to determine (although he's got some of the wittier comments of the century), but it's beyond doubt that bobby fischer is the greatest of them all.

      well, hooray: my mother offered to pay me ten dollars if i can remove these weird advertisements that appear every so often on her dell  urlLink peecee . i tried  urlLink ad-aware , which was certainly impressive in removing fifty to sixty files i can care less about but it did nothing to remove those pop up things. i might give $1 to nigel because he suggested trying everything  urlLink here ; surely something will work. we'll see about that.   the most worrying thing, i suppose, is that altogether this impressive set up has found six tracking devices, and i am sure there are at least six more hidden somewhere inside. which is typical of the reliability that we have come to expect of windows, i must say. thankfully i have patient parents.   well, on to more important things: a woman who once had an american accent  urlLink now speaks cockney , which is bad news because we in asia have only just started to graduate to a half-hearted american accent.   a pack of ciggies sold in france used to cost about SG$7.91 on average, now they cost about SG$9.33. who says our fags are expensive? (they cost SG$6.20 on average, see  urlLink this , and 44.7% of this six bucks goes into taxes, none of which is used to promote an anti-tobacco lifestyle)  and the rio karma looks like a very very nice (albeit looking cheaply engineered)  urlLink audio player .  pitchfork's  urlLink 100 top albums of the 90s . sonic youth's goo is at 80-something... and stereolab is ten places behind... and also on fifty-one. and when they release the top 20 tomorrow, i'll literally bet that two of radiohead's albums will make it... into the top five. where's jim o'rourke (my prediction: 15) and christian fennesz (10) and gastr del sol (5? please?) and godspeed (15)? even boc had one entry. mmm, anticipation. i have to go make coffee. bye.

      today they had a supposedly challenging SAT passage by a local book reviewer. and also there was an article on people playing scrabble! woohoo scrabble. it sucks though, because i've been losing game after game.  i have an inherent disability that keeps me from discovering eight letter combinations that sound remotely english. the other day i lost because i didn't realise that the word "partisan" was begging to be put in, and my worthy adversary put "quartz" on a fucking triple word score and got ahead by, um, about fifty to sixty points on that move alone. and needless to say i killed myself in the end by putting "insignia" on the board: it's 57 points, all right, but i just left a host of vowels leading to percarious squares of enemy reward. like a double word score thing, and in the end i lost by fifteen points. i suck. i had no reason to lose this, even if i so stupidly put a word to position the triple word play on quartz.  i could've won with "partisan"! i could have struck the lottery, gotten a few concubines and made dinner by three o'clock!  so now i'm training on my eight letter words. and you people can just, um, shove it. bye.

      since i feel like talking about myself, i will, um, one several choice question from ms dream girl's exciting latest instalment:   would you rather cause misery? what kind of a question is that? did you do comparatives in school? anyway, causing misery has its tradeoffs, but the major boon is that you can wake up in the morning and say to yourself in a loud, steady voice: "boy, i just pissed someone off yesterday, and i am proud of it, for the world is fucked up and i just cemented that factual expression into the truth books!"  well, there's a class gathering on saturday, which i am not keen on, honestly. but i liked the tranquil days of primary two. i forgot who i was sitting with, but on tuesdays i believe the last period of the day was physical education, and we swept across moist, cool grass blades, against friendly breezes and so forth. i don't remember so much of what we did, i just remember it was cool and i could not care so much about little seedlings getting stuck on my socks and all that. and we had social dancing, i think. mine was with a taller girl, and also somewhat of a tomboy if my memory is right. it had the air of oldness in it, something that others schooled in denser, modern concrete jungles will never ever understand, like we were living through the old days again. we only had chalkboards, and i still remember our worksheets were one of those papyrus-like fibre sheets that yellowed very rapidly and had primitive looking drawings. (our only exposure to white paper was this so-called "mahjong paper" which had a blank space on top to draw things and lines below to write a wordy description.) and of course, i scored full marks for mathematics that year (and the next). whatever happened. i could've become a food-adoring mathematics genius like kenji, but it was never to be.   cy says she always wondered what life was in my school (she lives nearby, but her parents did well to send her to a far away but vastly better school), but she stopped asking herself when she got a bit older and saw my schoolmates yelling and shouting and smoking and all that outside school and managed to convince herself for so long that it probably was some kind of a shit hole. and she was mostly right.

      err, yesterday we went to watch some movie called master and commander, which is metacritic's number two rated movie in recent times. it is, of course, the most entertaining film you will get to watch this year (like some of its rave reviews imply), but profound thematic meaning? not much. although more than one character had a distinctively american accent. that on an english ship too.   the good thing about christmas is that i can have an excuse to get my parents to buy me something just because "all my classmates and all my friends get expensive christmas gifts", which is somewhat true.   aye aye robert sailor

      i actually memorised a poem attributed to more than one person:  tender handed stroke a nettle,  and it stings you for your pains. grasp it like a man of mettle, and soft as silk remains.  not the kind of poem you'd relate to someone who is asking you why you practically stampeded through deep patch after deep patch of mud at football. and one caucasian fellow who met us later asked if i'd played soccer. (it could have been rugby, or rugger as known to some brits, but i was rather clean from the knees up.)  i said "they only call it soccer in the united states," and smiled beatifically, which somewhat removed his smile a bit and cy made a stupid grin and cocked a wry head american-style and said "actually, only the united states and singapore", which he found unusually witty. so much for linguistic consistency, dear SPH writers, you guys suck at it.   not that we're about to correct their language, maybe cy, but not me. or alice. bye.

      i saw lc again. i always see her with her boyfriend at the interchange hugging and all that, blissfully unaware and playing with each other's toes. (there is a reason why teenagers like slippers... convenience aside.) i mean ah, well, at least there are two happy people in the world. ah yue is thinking, of course, fuck, what happened to my best friend, that stupid bitch ran off with my crush. but that's a teen's world: it's not as much of an adult's world as we like to pretend it is but sometimes it does turn out that it's still close anyway.   yeah, fucking right. to put in a gremlin's perspective, kenn is like a gremlin who hates other gremlins because they're of an uglier shade of blue. hahaha. joke, that.   alice apparently hates scrabble because, strictly, it's kind of a luck game. but *still* it's no snakes and ladders.   anyway, it's 2am. argh.

       urlLink departure lounge's jetlag dreams : this is something you want to listen to if -- i imagine -- you're on a plane to nowhere and you need to forget that there's a lover back home crying his or her heart out onto a soft polyester cushion. makes you just a little bit tourist-haughty, like if you were an american touring singapore or something if the climate hasn't already defeated your spirits.    about yesterday's post on wing han: well, actually it doesn't sound as bad as it really is. my former footballing role was left-winger, and if you're playing with tennis balls you have got to cross (or deploy a kind of deft flick, as it usually is) a high, accurate, slow ball that you can chest to the floor and volley home without hurting your... you know... i wasn't, if i should put it this way, the consenting recipient. but i remember she was always the leader of the girls, and her chinese was too whoa. hongkongers. our female centre striker. or left-side striker or right-side striker, i don't recall. or even cmf.   that's a real ungirl girl for you.

      kf: thanks for the charcoal tablets. nine times out of ten when you've got a gastric ache in a train, standing up, you really want to curl up and keep squeezing your stomach like an overly adorable new pet never destined to live through the next forty eight hours. i almost became a gymnast, but your timely arrival at the bus terminus after almost an hour of pure gastric agony furnished me enough of those stupid tablets to feel... better. you are my saviour.   cy: apparently, your cultural theories are very 1988. get over it: sure, sonic youth turned alternative into top 40, but you don't have to gloat over it. stereolab also made weirdness cool in the 1990s bop-style, but i don't really care.   pat: i don't say this often, but get a lobotomy. you don't really talk, do you, you're programmed to produce noise that is interpreted by human brains as raving, almost incoherent series of words clumped to almost sound cohesive albeit too fast to catch. if you slow down a bit, you'll realise that you are reading the jungle book by rudyard kipling backwards ten chapters at a time.  as for charmaine "imelda" miranda: one, if kenn is too shy to personally ask you out to attend a human anatomy seminar (where the guestbooks are particularly fascinating, i hear) and you feel smug about it, you don't show it to the entire world, just like a teenager who discovers that he's got a nine inch floppy doesn't go waving it at his aunties. or a prata man able to fry a few eggs start shouting "humpty dumpty" at the top of his voice hoping the prime minister will come begging for an autograph. or the inventor of buttered toast... never mind.  two, john cena sucks. but that doesn't make the undertaker a saint, either. i like evil people, not a bloody spokesman for the hip-hop community or a guy who proves his manliness by swinging a bike chain around like a pathological criminal yields an axe. but sucking more than a vacuum cleaner on full speed, that comparison is a little light. he sucks more than a hyperbolic cyclist on steroids trying to inflate his butt with helium for air drag. stupid physics laws.   me: note to self: keep telling myself i am a qualified genius and somehow try to live to eighty deceiving myself. i'm pretty good at lying.

      saddam hussein arrested. woo. all this means is that george w. bush gets re-elected, US foreign policy remains crummy as ever, and select people benefit tremendously from oil. at least it's driving stocks up a bit, so my dad wants to dump some stock for real tangible cash, baby.   and my parents are, despite my constant barrage of news they will never get to read (mainly because they refuse to embrace the internet, which sucks), staunchly pro-US for our crummy (to use the slang term) local press. i'd like to talk on and on about why, but i am sure most of us are aware of our local press' shortcomings. long on shortcomings. pun not strictly intended.   to express my further annoyance at radiohead's anoitment as the best band of the 1990s (which is mostly deserved, honestly, and they don't seem to have any qualms about abandoning guitars, and that is very rare for a rock band indeed... but there are better bands than radiohead!), here are the six simple steps to write a killer radiohead album.  1. get into the mood. you are required to cut yourself up a bit and pretend that you are going to die because your lover left you to marry a mexican duck.   2. whip out a notebook, and start writing. anything will do, just as long as it's related to death and taxes and pesky things like insects. but try to sound dense, and not like those linkin park people. they sound like they have a combined IQ lower than their total number of fingers.   3. model the melody of your music to what it might sound like if you were crying in honey and no one can hear you. apparently, the sound of guitars won't exactly work here. your song must be about four minutes total, enough not to be a pop song, and also enough not to be craptacular.  4. establish the climax. radiohead songs have a climax that fit the context, duh. it's not like you're crying because your girlfriend or boyfriend got eaten by an alligator and then you get an orgasm, but more like you have just gotten a climatic  mental breakdown and after that you're laughing at yourself for no apparent reason. but it's got to be fast, maybe get it over with in twenty seconds or less.  5. the end. very important. must not be a fairy tale ending or one where all the important characters die in a stampede, but must remind you of an empty street devoid of life and feeling. no one is there, because what you wrote is all fake, but the feeling is palpable like if someone struck you on the head with a violin. or a vase.   6. repeat steps one to five enough to make an album (do include a few instrumentals, duh). find a record label and sell it. don't expect gullible people from singapore who buy only the pop hits to buy your song, but you'll have a kind of religious following just because you're a decent radiohead imitation. just never ever play guitars, and your formula is forever safe. but never ever get caught smiling. you can't, or you'll lose your respect among teenagers and parents who know they can't provide their children with a good future.

      i had this dream earlier where everyone calls me robert. anyway, i kind of miss my sister. she left for st john's camp on thursday and isn't coming back until monday. and honestly, i think uniform group activities are among the most futile activities you can engage yourself in.   why camp under miserable plastic sheets with people you don't know (my understanding has it that my sister's st john's group have people from different schools) and mosquitoes when you can come home to be manipulated into doing a wide variety of fun and interesting household chores by a superior brother? even my muddy shoes are crying for her return.   envy me. i'm an elder brother in a traditionally-run household struggling to find some modern relevance. to distill to its essence, i'll never get grounded and my sister is my personal slave.

"why, we have had sexual intercourse twiiiice, and we have two children..."  anyway, for a movie that is mostly unsubstantial, a fish called wanda has a  urlLink metacritic score of 81 , mind you.   "ANYBODY GOT ANYTHING THEY'D RATHER DO APART FROM MARCHIN' UP AND DOWN THE SQUARE?" okay. bye.

      happy, err, boxing day. i mean, hahaha, cy and i didn't sleep yesterday and the whole of this morning because of the christmas - boxing day movie marathon. quite good. there was one movie on a dancing boy, and another about two really old, really cheeky enemies. this latter movie, really, is about older people getting laid and all that, and in some worlds there are italian ladies with extremely firm, extremely melon-like busts at the age of fifty. and this world is it.   then later there was a show called "felicity", if i am not wrong, which is one of those american serials on young american adults where they have sex, break up and have sex again, even though all the friends are still in the house snacking on dessert, blissfully unaware. yeah right. randy nights.   "wish with one hand and crap in the other, well see which gets [full] filled first."  i am determined to  urlLink learn  cockney rhyming slang on the simple pretext that the word "breasts" indirectly maps to "Bristols", "testicles" maps to "cobblers", "septic" to refer to an american, and "trouble" to "wife". why, you little glass mouse, you filthy little scheming nostril. and damn those septics. good bye.

      yeah, good morning. how nice. everyone is assembled at home, the maid is cooking something at this hour, and... no presents. oh ho ho ho. also a good morning to read dense material on the abrahamic beliefs. yeah right.   anyway, errrr, i had pancakes this morning. it isn't even good to start with; we have only faux maple syrup and only a bit of margarine left. and the pancakes were literally paper-thin. don't ask me how she made them.  anyway, shove it. our foreign correspondents wrote a bit about howard dean, and is an okay introduction to howard dean the person, but is otherwise not very good anyway. but wesley clark is a very, very impressive fellow. he's more balanced, when you consider the person *and* the politics *and* the anti-bushness about him. anyway, bush needs to go. he's fucking up the world. at least matt groening would be happier. bye.

       urlLink musicmobs  is a great website to go to check musical trends, and people who use itunes are fairly cool, except those windows itunes users who only listen to linkin park all day. anyway, i did want to add my mac's library list to musicmobs, but it's not really necessary, and it'd be boasting. it'd make me the greatest music geek on the website, with 45000 plays and counting. but see my collection on my mother's computer only. the one on my mac laptop is more extensive at about 8000 tracks -- all ripped, since those damned filesharing programmes don't work-- which would probably bring most of my favourite artists into the top 10 easily. but here i only have a cd's full, since i can't do anything else while ripping my cd on this computer, i have to do so *very* selectively.   but the statistics are pretty cool indeed, and with definite evidence of some proper music fans with their own catalogue rollin', instead of someone who keeps listening to something that makes our local airwaves. lemmings, all of them.   anyway, yes, i did break down one day and decide to listen to one of alice's covers. although you may immediately ask if alice is not entitled to sell her versions of songs or to quickly emblazon her own "copyright" over them, she has the right to do so under US law, but she has to send mail to the artist in charge with 30 days' notice to invoke a license (which i believe is automatically and unconditionally given to her, unless she cribs the whole recording) to cover the song under US fair use terms. these may be mirrored in singapore law when the FTA takes place in just a few days' time.   we assume that alice is so smart from her english acing activities that she has already sent these artists their fair use letters already, so she is probably legally bound to do so. although people may sue her for deploying guitar, it's so 1966. no cool person ever plays guitar any more. (in case alice does indeed play all the guitar, it's the best strumming since sonic youth! errr heh. maybe not.)  but alice does have a sweet singing voice. really sweet like sugar. even though she sings the one they play EVERY TIME YOU SCORE A GOAL IN THAT WINNING ELEVEN GAME, IT'S NOT FUNNY ANY MORE. honest. i scored so many goals i turned delirious. never mind a more american voice singing it (words pronounced by americans like "hot", "fot", "bot" and "han solo" are now pronounced "hart", "fart", "bart" and "banjo" respectively). or that she does, admittedly, just slightly trips over the very very high chords, but every good woman has a bit of manliness in her. hence the tendency to spoil for a fight now and then. alice, seriously, well, keep it up. it's good enough.   cy did sing a stereolab song (she MEMORISED the whole of "lo boob oscillator" just to tramp on into "plastic sun" by sonic's kim gordon)... once. it's almost the most charming song ever, except that they try to spoof sonic youth at the three minute mark.

       and oh. i'd like to say that something great happened in school today, but not really. see jeremy's diary for details. no change in seating from last year, and every day i have to climb too many stairs to my class. but great wind, great view... and i stay back until 3pm. at least on monday. i've got a feeling that our schedule drags to 3pm every day of the school week... damn it!  and my geography teacher is also the teacher i dislike the most in school. the feeling appears to be mutual, and also unilaterally raised (that is, not by  me ), and i always got sent out during her lesson. sometimes for no reason at all, i might add. and that's life. i was the only one who got a warning letter, too, and those who used to be my classmates can testify that there are certainly more difficult, lazier and more stubborn characters than myself. and why me? i'm not even the biggest kid ever.   i remember watching this comedy called "taxi" with danny devito -- taxi is perhaps one of the best american comedies ever, and  urlLink don't just take my word for it , and they were going to buy a masterpiece belonging to a dying artist so they can sell it for massive profits, and to convince elaine to buy it the guys recite rudyard kipling's famous poem (of which a poster graces my room) starting from the second-last stanza.   cy: "ninety eight percent of existentialists already have a religion, and all of them think they're right."

      i sent a letter to streats half-berating the author for breeding american-gotten rock music instincts in all of us. and roberto  here's a list of questions i pilfered:  1. what did you do in 2003 that you'd never done before? impersonate brother paul, eat too much turkey sandwiches and, uh, not vomit.   2. did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? in the words of bill watterson, "i find it easier to live life with lowered expectations".  3. did anyone close to you give birth? no.  4. did anyone close to you die? no. my grandparents are all six feet below and my parents are healthy.   5. what countries did you visit? none.  6. what would you like to have in 2004 that you lacked in 2003? better grades. and money. and a lot of nice food to eat.  7. what date from 2003 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? the day we first got to meet our physics teacher, and also the day he said the immortal words when someone asked him a stupid question "liddat liddat liddat equal liddat lor". this is the most competent teacher since, i don't know.   8. what was your biggest achievement of the year? i made myself happy all year. subject to your interpretation.  9. what was your biggest failure? everything.  10. did you suffer illness or injury? flu, strained my hamstring and fell in love.  11. what was the best thing you bought? coca cola. i don't recall.   12. whose behaviour merited celebration?   13. whose behaviour made you appalled and depressed?   14. where did most of your money go? food.  15. what did you get really, really, really excited about? nothing.  i think so.   16. what song will always remind you of 2003? 2003 wasn't a great year for music.   17. compared to this time last year, are you happier or sadder? about the same. i don't fluctuate like girls do.  ii. thinner or fatter? both height and weight increase, so overall, i still look like a living skeleton. i hate myself.  iii. richer or poorer? about the same.  18. what do you wish you'd done more of? read more  19. what do you wish you'd done less of? spending too   20. how did you spend Christmas? rotting.  21. did you fall in love in 2003? oh yeah, i became hooked on grape juice. then i got sick.   22. how many one night stands? heh heh heh. none.   23. what was your favourite TV programme? MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS, duh.   24. do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year? no.  25. what was the best book you read? i don't try to rank my books. and honestly, most of the books these days are trash. in particular, 'someone like you' by sarah dressen.   26. what was your greatest musical discovery? they were all mostly great.   27. what did you want and get? three meals, shelter and the ability to make fun of all my teachers.   28. what did you want and not get? a lot.    29. what was your favourite film of this year? i watched "tora tora tora" last night, and considering all of the latest movies are pretty crummy, that's my favourite now.  30. what did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? nothing. my parents wanted us to go out or something, but i said "either we migrate from this stupid country or we'll do nothing", and they settled for the latter.   31. what one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? no school.  32. how would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2003? at home, i am a singlets boy. outside, cy usually chooses what i wear, and i wear ridiculously plain things.   33. what kept you sane? never was.   34. which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most? oh, george w. bush. yeah. what a bastard.   35. what political issue stirred you the most? none. they're just as bad or good to me so long as i'm safe and well.  36. who did you miss? robert and sik hui.  37. who was the best new person you met? bl... i think.   38. tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2003. when in doubt, always feign ignorance.  39. quote a song lyric that sums up your year. i prefer instrumentals.

      anyway, the electricity is out until five, i think. well, i've still got access to an electrical appliance until all this brian eno music and tapping on this computer finishes my laptop's batteries. (update: one afternoon nap later, they've got it restored, and it isn't 5.30pm! efficiency... oh no. i'm not going to take the bait and start raving like crazy about the government.)  i watch a lot of simpsons for a distressed boy. woo. they're worth liking because they admit openly to inserting right-wing messages as possible, and the voice-recognition stock quote system  urlLink maps fox  to "what the hell is this crap". amazing. just amazing. and they have an entire episode dedicated to the fact that homophobes are idiotic, and probably very 1970. come on. 89% of homophobes are people who find something to be prejudiced against because -- quite secretly -- they purchase avril lavigne cds on the bulk. that's despicable and homicide-worthy. not the cds, the people.   eh, maybe there's something in my orange juice. i don't know. and there's something about adults that, you know, keeps stirring the hate? and you know what else i fucking hate? i hate rich people who have gone to nice big schools all their lives and then go home and lament on the internet about the stressful educational system. well, shut the fuck up. weirdly, the problems of 70% of the population are never represented on the newspapers. stupid people who live in private estates.   when i get miffed i go eat something. bye.

      an english translation of stereolab's "cybele's reverie": "what to do when one has done everything cried, wept and laughed on all the rooftops in all of the towns and the country?"  there's a discussion on stone skipping at slashdot, but two things: it's all thanks to barnes wallis the inventor of the bouncing bomb (he originally planned for dimpled spherical bombs but settled for cylindrical bombs for practical reasons, although flying  urlLink a lancaster low under flak  is no joke), and an actual paper on stone skipping isn't *that* complex. which means that wallis is probably the first great stone skipping physicist-researcher. wallis is also noted for  urlLink research on geodetic construction . see also  urlLink pbs .   a  urlLink glowing review  of sigur ros:  "This album shimmers--Stars are going to have to find another word for whatever it is that they do."

      spinning: david bowie, neu!, ulrich schnauss, st germain  THE WOMAN possessed a hypothetical glow about herself, one that took form in physical salience as well as a kind of aura that engaged the senses: a delectable although common cologne floated delightfully, and the sharp clog-clog-clog clattering of loose heels on the marble flooring. one could see her slight plumpness foraging through whatever imaginary greenery that lay ahead, hindered by glass slippers only a well-fed royalty could bear to - inappropriate to the occasion - put on for a little hike through the elements and the sheer roughness of nature. she seemed a little out of picture - no round, lush, earthy greens to complement the entourage of pale cotton garments fittingly tailored for her modesty; and an uncomfortable mix of apprehension and excitement fuelled and cajoled her on. she stumbled a bit in the last few steps, but as all great individuals do, made a quick recovery and made for the waiting carriage. the horse whined impatiently, as did in a way more reminiscent of a human groan the horseman who had the unenviable task of bearing the brunt of its nihilistic tendencies -- he lived a year in a minute sharing the breath of a creature that was sure to stop his if the damned vain bitch took a second longer in arrival. not all fairy tales are fairy tales through and through, it would be a fairy tale of a fairy tale. it had been waiting for a woman to put the finishing touches to the black, curly mess on her head, and it was about time they headed for the ball anyway. the prince would be waiting.

      hmm. well kee wen made jeremy and me wait so long for his meeting thing and then proceeded to abandon us for a basketball game. as red-blooded singaporeans like to say:  you good.... pro already right... win grand slam huh... yeah next time i'll be the !@#!@#!@#!@# umpire!  hahaha. ok then. i haven't shopped for my kp shirt yet. a kp shirt, if you do not know, is some form of checkered shirt in the ugliest hue ever, and for kp it's actually two shades lighter than shit brown, and a bit of white-grey on top of that. then all i do is wear a pair of trousers and put on some cheap canvas shoes. no one notices the difference.   and apparently, imelda has some problems comprehending a language only understood by the supernatural and the saintly. she in fact -- through jeremy, which is not only a cheap measure but a cowardly one as well -- told me to go to hell holding a magic wand in my hand, and then said nothing when she had the chance to verbally insult me over the phone. let's see if you have nothing to say if i tell your boyfriend. muahahahahha.   ok guava juice time bye

      kee wen and i have our test on the 24th at expo. blah.   zero 7 is the perfect fusion of guilty guitar pop, keyboardish acoustic guitars, fuzzy IDM and not entirely clever  urlLink lyrics , but there you go. it's even christian pop at intervals. "in the waiting line" could have been an argument for the theists, but it's like sophie barker waking up in red jammies with her hair in all the wrong places and putting on nerdish thick glass and rubbing her eyes delicately and there's an alien on her bed holding her hand and they're singing "do you believe in what you see? everyone's saying different things to me!" and when the song is done the alien has disappeared and she realises it morphed magically from the emblem on her blanket. maybe a guyferd blanket.   if anything, i might be one of those MTV directors one day. but only if it was some intelligent lounge pop and the vocalists were all cute girls with nice voices. i'd be the alien.   and now for something completely different: boring language nonsense. don't read further if you think english is a language meant for idiots, it'll bring you down to its level and defeat you with confusing vocabulary.   isn't that formulaic? but fuck, what isn't formulaic? i mean, within the newton-bound confines of earth.   oh yah, grammar. lye hwa (we call teachers by surname in school, but in inquisitive blog postings like this one, i hope we can dispense with formality) seemed pretty insistent about groups not being referred to with "are" and "have"; that is, 'the group is' and 'the team is' and 'the Concert Band is'. but isn't it supposed to be the case? pertinent question. apparently, the bbc do not see it that way, and lye hwa (we refer to teachers by surname in school, which  thinks the bbc "is wrong". (the headline of this  urlLink article  on bbc sport says "man utd rule out investigations", which is telling enough.) of course, i don't know what the beeb might think about "the bunch of grapes are horny and fruity souls", but i dunno. honest to goodness. the beeb's official stance is that  urlLink they are practically complementary  if you can change your perspective a bit. of course, there's also the headline "US lets canada bid for reconstruction work", which not only reeks of fox but also americanism.  and for those of you with "drug problems" and intentions to study "material engineering", take note that since narcotics deals with a great variety of drugs and the latter deals with a great variety of materials, the beeb deems it better to refer to them in the plural. "drugs problems", "materials engineering". but you read the "sport pages", and not "sports pages", although you will note that there are no "musics pages", and most people will differentiate aesthetic from the plural by verb versus discipline (noun).   so why am i so militant on trying to find out more precise british english conventions? well, i don't really know. it's one of those mindless teenage passions. (like for linkin park and being on either side of the political camp.) grammar is really fun. even the americans with their sulfur (they sniff lots of its gaseous incarnations in los angeles) and their not pronouncing the H in herb (they got it from the english, who got it from the french... and later the english changed the pronunciation and the spelling).

      i realised one thing after having to sit down in one place, eat pastries, and being forced quite simply to watch a girl wagging her stupid ponytail like a whale wags its... ah spit. anyway, the thing is that i think i realised what i truly hate in this world: girls with ponytails. it's so irritating i wish i could cut them off and laugh insidiously. no wait, it's correct to use in some context but has the wrong connotations. maybe i should say "cackle".   on irc, singaporeans cackle like this: "KEKEKEKEKEKE". yeah, that'll show the americans how bloody smart we are. good night.

      winston churchill:  "Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened."   recently, our school website had a much needed revamp to something less awful, but awful nevertheless. and our school policies  urlLink model  around a good english standard, chinese and christian values, and to be gentlemanly. if there is a marist who is actually less barbaric than a horse deprived of its caffeine supply, well, he isn't. and we're not only proud of the fact that we are enormously uncivilised, we're also smug about it.   now, it's not that i hate the school or what, but every bad thing you've heard about the school is true. some of us have pointed ears, some of us kiss pixies and most embarassing of all -- some of us even peep at the pigeons screwing on the rooftop as they bob from side to side while we are supposed to be doing something useful, like singing the school song for the millionth time, or doing a test, or watching a teacher babble on with a blank expression that reveals an awful lot. we also have no toilet paper in the toilets for one of two reasons: some person or persons unknown have been eating our supply of toilet paper, or the school has "absentmindedly" struck it off its annual budget for the tenth year running.   conspiracy theorist? mmm conspiracy. this is the nacho man signing off from, er, mars. bye.

      hello. i am rich. today was uneventful. we made our one and only stop to first auntie's house (since, unfortunately, my uncles have all shuffled off their mortal coils). she lives one bus stop away from shiqi, the ever youthful moon goddess. and anyway it's so weird to have cousins who are already breaching forty five, and my youngest cousin on my pa's side got married last year and was conspicuously missing today.   and as usual we had this ayam pongteh and chicken curry, in typical  urlLink nyonya  fashion. but i think i've lost my sense of taste. i demolished all the "special" chilli at reunion dinner without a whimper, and three whole green chillies with my lunch. really. and i ate almost two tablespoons of belachan chilli made with the hottest chilli padi my maid could dig out. i think it's because i've been eating tasteless meat with tiao hua jiu + pepper recently. it helps make food a lot more eatable, actually. but if i can't enjoy my chilli any more, then i guess i'd rather not be alcoholic.   nig wanted to introduce to me his cousin who is about the same age as us, and i said something stupid to her on the phone. i stopped short of proposing to her on the phone, and she said i was a disgusting creep and hung up. i may not be good at  urlLink stalking many girls simultaneously , but i am on an individual basis.   i think i've still got biology and chemistry homework. both undone. woo! and on saturday, SAT test. i've been screwing up all my practise stuff. everything. i think not a single question correct. i refuse to memorise vocabulary, or to integrate one hundred new words into my vocabulary by daybreak. i'm not one of those jackasses who get by every test by memorising and sitting down by my desk doing the same kind of exercises and questions. i kind of feel like lye hwa now. argh. i even like her favourite wuthering heights. not really. it isn't a great book, actually: the only truly well fleshed out character is male (heathcliff). it ends abruptly. (although i like my books like that.) and this book is written by emily bronte. but stories by female writers excel in two things: a great ending and ghosts, and wuthering heights showcases the near pinnacle of both with a storyline that barely hangs together. barely.   so much for wuthering heights. i am going. bye.

      today they played some lion dance thing for the chinese new year thing for TWENTY MINUTES (note: the lion kept staying where it was half the time, the high point was when it climbed and descended a short desk, and they kept clashing the drums in the same beat and melody for the twenty minutes). total crap. obviously, it reeks of desperation on the part on some groups unknown to scrape together some kind of festive spirit.   and my class won the best cny decoration award. no, really. my class have a few of thse more aesthetic people, in the sense that they like to cut paper and all that. everyone keeps saying that they're transvestites, but i guess winning this award isn't going to help their reputation decement itself.   err wait. i am rich now. lots of red packets. i don't have to say anything else.

      so yes, tired this morning. i have cca in twenty minutes, and i should be there now, but i don't want to be there. and at four, football. i don't really care about cca now. what do i earn from two hours every saturday watching space? one cca point. honestly, i'd rather be sleeping (my favourite hobby), or readiing on the net. i'm actually reading balzac through the internet! never ceases to amaze, technology.   overseas  urlLink reaction  to the bbc crisis: "BBC news has never been as well regarded in New York as it is now. Ironically, it is mistrust of their own commercial  urlLink media , and the sense that it fails to question government policy enough, that has driven so many New Yorkers to overseas outlets."

      i ate too much. dammit. what happened to joeycop recently. and malcolm, it seems. he says maya sucks. i don't happen to disagree with that view, but maya ain't all crap either. and i got the marks i deserved for my level tests.   eh i need some pistachios. the ones i have are too salted, my sparkling grape juice has disappeared...  btw, hutton inquiry over. lord hutton chastises the beeb, and guardian unlimited become conspiracy theorists, and all of slashdot rushes to their defence. blair demands an apology from the bbc. yeah, see, that's free press. i don't know if it's objective press, but that's free press all right. the bbc is in the wrong, but tony blair is a stinking liar. enough politics. i am going.   today's smart american quote: "history is written by the victors man [sic]. At one time a bunch of people hiding in the woods and sniping at officers was beyond reproach, and were the "terrorists" of their time. We here in the USA call them revolutionaries now, and revere them. During the civil war, the north took a radical step by attacking civilian and logistical targets instead of purely military ones. A move that would have been reviled had the north ended up losing, instead it's hailed as tactical genius."

      for the first time, a parrot has learnt with some proficiency about 350 english words. excellent. and some things don't change either: yet another windows virus. woo. and yet another american wisecracks on slashdot that they are just too productive -- this time, at least he thinks his civilisation is on the way down.   on recomendation i've been reading gustave flaubert's most famous novel madame bovary. and of course, in addition to balzac's "another study of woman". but we shall see. so far i'm liking the flaubert a bit more.   ah, stupid school. i 'ate it. bye.

      damn it. the lexmark printer connected to my mom's dell just jammed and i can't reprint all my things, like the big eight*a4 collage kelly assembled for me which i have to cut out and paste into a single masterpiece. well, yeah, i could have used my mac... if lexmark had some mac printer software for that  urlLink  particular model . it doesn't.   "I'm as happy as a Frenchman who's just invented a pair of self-removing trousers."   anyway, it's a bad day. i skipped cca today because i don't give a damn. and i watched two monty python episodes. which is worrying, because there are only 31 episodes (i hear) well worth watching -- about three seasons, so i have to ration well. i'm also going to watch "a fish called wanda", which i didn't watch as promised.   of course kee wen says, um, monty python is inferior to simpsons. that is considering the fact that he has never watched a monty python show before, and also considering that if he did, he would probably not understand obviously easy jokes. and also that he doesn't watch anything that isn't a box office hit, doesn't listen to anything that does not make it into the top 10 charts, or  urlLink not use a computer operating system that less than nine out of ten computer users would choose (willingly or not) . and he reads anything that his favourite target audience -- six year old students -- read. harry potter. or use a handphone brand that is not "nokia".  well, that's the asian teenage consumer demographic for you. (blame the culture.) you can't trust the opinions of the asian teenager. it's bound to be along the lines of "this is better because everyone else is using it", which discounts the possibility that everyone using it might have no taste, or everyone using it might be much less smart than they imagine. goodbye.

      two days ago, y dared me to ask a random sundry shop girl out for valentines' day. which i did, because i don't engage in bets where i don't win either way. (nb: i happen know the girl personally... but still she rejected. it could've been a month of free meals.) the consequence of that is... i have free meals for five days at any of several expensive restaurants, all happily sponsored by y. woo. i rocker.   so now, i am date-less, tired, lonely, cold and suffering from a bout of boredom-nitis. so i'm trying now to ask, um, my biggest crush on this entire planet -- to protect her privacy, let's call her alice and let's put her initials as YQY -- to go out with me and i can't contact her at all. (i am appealing to everyone who is a mortal to contact this person for me.) upsetting.    anyway, i should be going now, to -- er -- study. bye.

      guess who got a whole  stack  of free mcdonald's ice-cream cone vouchers. well, don't guess. it's me.   the collage has been printed. but it's a bit too colour-balanced. fiery expressions co-exist too evenly with greens and blues. and my room is a bit too bright for my liking, so... well, it graces my wall now, albeit with colour enhancements.  y and i have watched, um, two episodes of blackadder, two episodes of the simpsons, and two episodes of goodness gracious me (wish i could find those episodes, it's a great show). it's damn funny.    ahahhaha blackadder is damn cool. woo. it's the first show to make us chortle like bloody fools since fawlty towers and monty python. it's one of the nominees of britain's best sitcom, along with fawlty towers. (mp would have taken it if it were a sitcom for sure...) but i think blackadder might just win after all...   a certain john sergeant says in the case for blackadder that "it was big and  bold and boasted the cleverest use of the English language in any  sitcom". which is what will ultimately prevail in the end: fawlty towers has more bang for the buck but less juice for the laugh.    my favourite simpsons quote: "without a bar mitzvah i'm just a boy... with a prostate the size of a goat's head!" -- krusty (he makes an appropriate gesture underestimating this size, following which lisa winces a little)  my favourite blackadder quote: "Why, your very posture tells us, 'Here is a man of true greatness'. Either that, or 'Here are my genitals. Please take them.'" you can see what i mean.   all right my tuition homework beckons. even the dictionary agrees with me that oct- refers to eight, so why am i supposed to be learning differently? ok bye.

      the  urlLink oldest-looking pragmatist  i've  urlLink seen  yet: [on copy protection mechanisms] 'That is the wrong approach. The only way to survive in this moving and evolving world is to grow and evolve with it.' note, however, that he does not sport any wrinkles.   for the past few days, i have eaten at a fast food restaurant. it's not that i like to gorge myself and my arteries with an impressive array of "suicide foods", but i'm already sick of hawker centre food. i have eaten at every store, from the one that sells the mee rebus with the cheap, diluted gravy, to the famous noodle store manned by this hippie in his sixties who sports hair as oily as his lard-infested soup and who swaggers as he scoops sauces into inferior plastic bowls. and when he gets the chance to loaf, he sits on the table adjacent to his store, drinks plain carbonated water and just inhales a whole fag, all the time making assorted references to the human anatomy, especially the part or parts between the legs. (i think he *does* sell chicken leg noodles, but i bet those are unpopular.)  hence my visit to the most apparent contribution of western culture to obesity in developed countries. such a label is quickly dissolved in whatever they use to fry the freedom fries the moment you talk to the cashier.  one time i asked -- not knowing exactly what McName (tm) it was -- for an orange flavoured soft drink they call mcfizz (they could have rebranded coca-cola and marked up the price five times, and teenagers would still buy it), and the girl at the counter looked at me as if "soft drink" was an expletive in a bizarro world (i am not a fan of comic books). in the end the girl blurted why i didn't ask for "orange juice and that sprite", and the manager next to her whitened in absolute astonishment.   "you mix that cheap orange juice with sprite into this tiny cup and sell it for the combined price for both?" (in the end, i did not make the purchase.) then the people in the queue did seem to have rather disgusted expressions, but all was ok after about fifteen seconds and singaporeans continued to be cheated by a world-renowned restaurant that mocks people with clowns and some purple creature (not a monster because he is smiling, and he's got purple fur).   today was different -- i went there because y begged for a "cheap" meal (they are giving out those discount coupons outside the MRT today) after paying for my last three twenty-dollar meals (which i earned fair and square, mind you). and that turned out to be a mistake. behold:   "buying this coupon, ah?" "err, ya." (in mandarin) "do you want the dessert or the fries?" (in very poor mandarin) "i'll take the dessert." (goes to the dessert dispensing machine for a moment and returns with a cup of cream with chocolate on top) "eh, you want de hot fart or de storberry ah?" "hot what?!" (frustrated) "fart lah! hot fart! hot fart!"  that exchange continued until y figured out that she was talking about "hot fudge". and even then it's not exactly the finest example of "hot". so remember: if you ask for a hot fart, note that what you ask is not what you will get.

      btw, i threw up after the run today. i know, i'm hardly the most convincing runner on the planet, but i ate so much for breakfast.   professor iPod  urlLink notes  in a wired magazine review: "But personal stereos reflect a cultural drift." (the reason *why* any kind of music revolution will not affect cultural drift in asia is, i believe, equal parts due to asian culture and global music distribution.)  i am reading this  urlLink article  on clarence darrow, easily the most eloquent lawyer in the world. damn, what a fine one too. he brought philosophy to the courts. this is a man who pusehd blame to the skies and the stars, and poked at religion whenever he could. and what a fine agnostic.   on the scopes trial, he blighted the whole of religion in a heated rant and got the judge to ban eight darwin theorists from testifying in court, and then requested for long-time bible expert and prosecutor (!) jennings as a defense witness, only to shoot down his (extreme, if you ask me) christian beliefs. (mostly.) jennings died six days after the end of the trial.   by the way, darwin became an agnostic (although i believe it's  towards extreme atheism) towards the end of his life, but his wife and children tried to protect his public image as a christian until his eventual death.   SAT scores came in the mail today. fyi, kee wen and i were among the 25 000 who took the examination at singapore expo on the twenty-fourth of last month. mail on time. fairly impressed.  my SAT scores read: 780 verbal 600 math. yes, 600. i had 1/3 of my arithmetic questions wrong. please don't rub it in. i know y will butcher my score when she takes a re-test this year (her 750 V 550 M test was taken last year). i know i like to make silly excuses for every failure, but trust me, a test that ends three to four hours late does not help to defray one's virgin test nerves. and i know my bladder was on the brink of bursting for half the test.   ah, okay, i have a headache. sunspots. bye.

      i think i'm turning vegetarian. ever since i stopped weaning (and started whining, and  that  has never stopped since) i've been eating some kind of meat, and my arteries have inherited the legacies of countless members of the animal kingdom.   yes, so while  urlLink terz  laments about civil engineers (the engineer joke *is* all over google and slashdot), i'd like to start complaining about how mediacorpse used  urlLink FOX NEWS FEEDS FOR THEIR LIVE IRAQI WAR COVERAGE , yes, the smartest idea since they introduced those variety shows where the hosts scream like they've got mice in their knickers (and we got sick of that eons ago) and the same sappy dramas that people just love to watch. yeah.   i can hardly say "mediacorpse is a company run by sane, rational people with an IQ above that of a mexican jumping bean" without choking on my favourite water chestnut drink and reproducing it all over my iBook's cute screen and keyboard. mediaworks isn't much better, they just keep emulating everything mediacorpse does. now try saying "mediaworks is a company run by sane, rational people with an IQ above a doornail because they don't emulate everything mediacorpse does, and everything mediacorpse does simply reeks of the carcass of inferiority". i'd rather step on a box of kitties, bless them, than say that. at gunpoint.    and also, although this is more because of very crafty planning, SBS' decision to happily alter bus services as they like it to "reduce redundancies in public transport" and to "facilitate integration with the NEL". you all know what that means, don't you. doesn't it just reek of a company desperate to write off losses from a metro system they can't operate in such a way that it turns in a profit, and so taking full advantage of their monopoly over public transport to make us spend a lot more.   and what is it that i was talking about? ah, i forget. i feel a whole lot more civil now, for a change. usually i just have all the hatred huddled up somewhere, tossing and turning under a thick blanket. it feels unbearably warm and fuzzy, like if you ate sweaters. or the polyester filling of my pillow. and i just want to drink something citrus and bitter. like coke. i mean, citrus tea. goodbye.

      so, in between demolishing my pile of tuition homework (since, thankfully, school work seems to be a bit on the thin side for now), i have been listening to air's "walkie talkie".   no ripcord (rating it at 80%) says it best: "With all its shallowness and artifice, it can only ever be a guilty pleasure. But it is the most intense of guilty pleasures."  anyway, blackadder is damn cool. i like the second season. percy: "i laugh in the face of fear and tweak the nose of the killer spindly fish!" wonderful.  and now, mmm food time. toodles.

      guess which catchphrase has keen wong's (always keen, surely) seal of approval for most f***ing irritating political soundbite of the year.   that's right, chen shui-bian's "taiwan". y remarks that it is indeed remarkably irritating. just imagine he and hu jintao at the negotiations table and chen screaming "taiwan" in his face and hu wiping his face ever so gently with a large white hankerchief.   ah. i have two weeks' of music (about 4000 tracks), and even then i've only found brian eno's apollo soundtrack to suit the mood:  "deep blue day" from the apollo soundtrack for the scene after winston has betrayed julia and is now whiling his time away at the chestnut tree, awaiting news of victory.   "always returning" from the apollo soundtrack for the scene when winston is courting julia. well, and a few other scenes. it's not a natural fit, but fits the mood surprisingly well.

      oh, just before dinner i was thinking of studying for tomorrow's emaths test. but i am in fact out of grid paper (and i have been since slicable bread was invented, and that was perhaps when people baked breadfruit a la mutiny on hms bounty), so that will kill all my academic inclinations for today. maybe.    i gave a rose (free, courtesy of a very nice florist lady, thank you!) to d that i creatively edited. with scissors. y swears that since evilness is gaining some kind of cult popularity, i'll be the most popular person in a tertiary institution. if i make it that far.   during physics class we were duly reminded that we have to maintain a proper standard of english in our written answers. right. right. i would have scanned a copy of his quality answers if i had remembered to regurgitate every little quibble with his version of queen's english; but i didn't. argh. that is my one regret of an otherwise short day (cut in half by teachers who always fail to turn up on this day of the week, by some mysterious circumstance). damn, i should've stolen the guilty transparency slides (note the plural) for the review of the denizens of the WWW. damn damn damn damn.   right. my new diet (in the more vegetables sense, not the eat-until-i-am-bonified sense) is going very fine. i feel better when i'm meat-free. like a butterfly with really big wings. (or like if you sniffed glue, which i promise i will never ever do.) you sure glide in the air, but it sure feels giddy fluttering around in the afternoons. joking about the last bit. bye.

      i have a major headache now. how it hurts, dear head!   simpsons quote of the day: [on looking down the blouse of a fellow mensa member] comic book guy: Forsooth, mine eyes doth rove of their own accord.  implicit blackadder quote of the day: "Well, Mr Blackadder always says, when the going gets tough, the tough hide under the table.

      to the brave souls who wasted every minute of your personal development trying to figure out foreign (the descriptor is purely relative) languages, you have been duly granted with a nice alphabet on your exam slip. hopefully, the first one. i hear alice has done very well. (along with those really gifted people in our class who got promoted to hcl last year. i think all aced.) congratulations!  the ridiculous class people bought a fish paradise (a trendy new age word for "enclosure"). today, i am proud to inform you that this humble new circus for aquatic life has been colonised by a grand total of one shrimp, the length of which is about the size of my pinky.   anyway, i am going to make myself a midnight snack of some sort. gurgle gurgle.

      good evening. cy and i are - very desperately - trying to find "porridge" on dvd, vcd or dvd rip. and i don't have a dvd player, which sucks. rp has been raving about it for so long, and he refuses to lend us the dvd. lousy no gooder. yes, i know they sell it on amazon.co.uk, but i'll never trust amazon with my money (or my parents' money, really) again.   oh yes, homework. i have plenty. we have biology, chemistry (a lot of it, anyway), a maths, e maths, and the chinese high physics prelim paper. and chinese (damn!) and 2 english comprehensions and elective geography worksheet(s) *and* mr low typed us a special letter beseeching us to study the entire sec 3 syllabus by the end of the week. oh yeah, we will. we are such academically motivated and ambitious people. and a certain steffi is complaining about *her* homework, in between flirty talk with her chinese high comrades. hahaha. china schools unite.   so yes, i am going to start on my homework quest by screaming or crying. or both.   on another note, i have been accused by a certain lady of cyber-vandalism (i was not named directly, but her flames aren't the most subtle clues in history). note that i find my time better served "contributing" to newsgroup messages, slashdot or just plain reading; as opposed to pretending to be someone with no original cultural taste, no sense of humour (to some extent, anyway), and no sense of satire whatsoever. (she *does* possess it in her blood, but in written communication she kills it too quickly, defeating its original purpose.)   the responsible person remains elusive. and given the anonymity of the internet, the truth may never come to pass. but this humble netizen wishes to curse this eccentric busybody to hell and beyond, and do have a nice day yourself. thank you.

      currently slogging away at a puzzle question. it was brought up by ben the other day, and kenji ran it through his breadboard emulator and found that my original solution was wrong (and it was, anyway, even if the method was right -- i got basic arithmetic in the way). so, back to the drawing board. pf gave me a hint. [edit: everything i've tried so far is wrong, but i've got a feeling my original solution is correct, just that i haven't got my mathematics right.]  the new school veep came in for a talk (which lasted an hour, and none of us fell asleep!) this morning, and for a person whose husband is also our school's chief "enforcer of justice", she's more approachable. in a sense. that's admirable for various reasons, and among them, it's that teaching *is* a social job however you cut it; and also that, yes, for once you could see that your classmates had the sort of glint in their eye, the kind like if the school was undergoing a kind of Renaissance -- although otherwise still very much the same. man, a veep that goes around exchanging gossip (a little, anyway) and encouraging us to screw the books if we prefer our girlfriends. and a veep that, for once, is going to headhunt all the "cool kids" for a personal talk.   ah, time to eat. i'll go now. bye.

      i'm reading several excellent jack london books, including one i've read before, "call of the wild". of course, one cannot fathom why maud and humphrey build separate huts (they're lovers). another that i'm looking forward to is the iron heel, the precursor to orwell's 1984.   also on the cards, several ambrose bierce books from gutenberg. ambrose pierce is that guy who wrote the devil's dictionary (see dict.org to access), and as the name implies, the entry for "christian" reads:   One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin.  on idiots, he writes:   "And after the rest of us shall have retired for the night of eternal oblivion he will sit up to write a history of human civilization."  fucking cool fella. time for dinner, bye.

      yup, i'm hungry again. today we had... let me see... yes. some fish soup thing. it's totally horrible. even the sour plum + assorted things couldn't save it. it still sucks. what i'd like is herbal soup. bitter, i know, but us HDB people don't quite have the money to indulge in all the luxuries.   anyway, i crave laksa now. very bad craving. mmmm. laksa + buah keluak (only if the gravy is superb) + char kway teow + carrot cake (more like radish cake and lots of egg) + one store i remember where you eat some chilli padi with pieces of beancurd (yum) and so on and so on and so on. OHHHH i need you so badly. i want you, i need you, i crave you. all i ask for is to be able to sit in a food court, air conditioned, peace, food and a nice drink. and wireless web access, and a nice couch, and television, and satellite radio. and a plump girl to massage me (less bones, less pain). and a krusty doll. yeah!  and i'd like a zoo named after me. i think. but i'll shut up and go make myself some egg and porridge now.   football day. i have nothing to say about my lousy football. i can't dribble, can't run properly, can't kick or pass correctly, can't shoot, can't volley and pretty much everything else. i even react too slowly. but i'll learn.   a people daily article (no link, sorry) says that about 36% of schooling chinese singaporeans speak english at home. 36%. i always thought it was something like 20%. that proportion has since risen to 45% in recent times, that is, the latest batch of babies. it isn't as if among that 60% of chinese speaking chinese, all of them speak perfect mandarin. quite the contrary. none of my mandarin speaking friends speak with the locally indecipherable accent of a true-blue cheenapiang (yup, we even have a singlish word insulting our heritage).   and  urlLink this page  talks about christianity providing the best moral value: right below it, there's a table that shows that christianity is the undisputed religion of choice among university-educated singaporeans. and i don't know the implication of that. i'll be honest: i don't think it's any more "moral value" than "western trends", "modern thinking" and "globalisation". (think: people with "modern thinking" roam with so little, that "if a zebra's skin were fashioned for their needs, it'd only have one stripe".) [super cool quote from cy, what a fucking smart bitch. hawhaw.]  ah, what am i saying. i need to eat something now. goodbye.

       okayy.being the supremely nice being that i am, i have gladly (or perhaps not) decided to help emu with his template.perhaps it was the after-effects of inhaling too much helium, i'll never know.and thus, this brilliant template was born! though i fancy it is a tad too teenager-ish and cool for the dear old turnip.hmm. yeah, well, steffi helped a bit too.just a bit. with certain html configuration which i sadly could not do.but i was the source of it all. heil charmaine!  if you really are dead bored or feeling stupid, go read my blog.the link is at the side of the page.in case you really  are  stupid, my name is charmaine.now dont forget that, kiddo, it might be worth a million bucks someday. woot.time for my dear partner-in-crime, steffi chan, to say her bit. mind you, she's feeling rather high.must have overdosed on something as well. perhaps it was jay chou (or KENN... hee). (:     HELLO! steffi here. haha i feel so honoured to be writing in emu's diary. now now as i am a girl of few words, i will just impart a few wise words for all of you to ponder over:  "to be great is to be great... and to be great is to be steffi"  this basically means that steffi is great. hmm steffi rocks! yes!  "gareth gates is THE man"  yay gareth gates rocks! woohoo! hmm all those who like his songs (ESPECIALLY ME AND KENN) rock. all those who call him gay (like EMU)... they dont rock (im being nice here)  ok la dunno what to say alr. hmm shall do some great advertising here.  go to my urlLink  diary  and tag my tagboard!

      yes, that's the new title of my fresh, teenager-y new layout. all thanks to charmaine (who did a lot) and steffi (who shifted this text down below the rich of evil google ads). and if you have noticed, someone has declared that i am 1. homosexual; and 2. that steffi rocks. i don't know what his or her affiliation with our earth's most abundant resource is, but well - my sexual orientation is on for debate.   oh yeah, my music collection (unfortunately mostly half-ripped, and i've had no time to rip brian eno's neroli) is now accessible to the other two computers outside. pretty cool, except my mother thinks "wireless networking" will load her new laptop with junk. what a dampener.    i'm reading blogs that wouldn't be so bad if they weren't all so sappy. AHHHH. all right. i am going now. bye

      Now spinning:  Hands  from the album Rounds by  urlLink Four Tet   i'm using  urlLink ecto  for this entry. very nice. for the most part (it can parse current music information, mmm).   my parents are off to buy a laptop that is probably heavy, bulky and lasts an hour on battery, just because they would rather listen to their friends than my purchasing advice (and trust me, i do sufficient research).    my books list is still progressing, but not at a rate i appreciate. i swear i used to read faster than y, and now i'm only at about 10 pages a minute (i think that number sounds a bit suspect, but i know that speed-readers approach 55 pages per minute). said fellow bookworm has demolished bronte, and a lesser known dickens book in a day. (yes, she finished a dickens in a day, but sometimes i don't think i trust what she says.)  a last thing: how come lisa simpson is never featured in a simpsons episode as being an agnostic? all right, bye.

       now playing: chanson pour solal by air. feels (note the use of the word in preference of "sounds") like angels communicating with voles.   good afternoon. this weblog's new and ugly look has been brought to you by kc. it looks less readable, actually.    for lunch today we have fried vermicelli ( bee hoon , as us lowly chinese singaporeans typically call it). all egg, unattractive shreds of caixin (i know of no english translation for this vegetable's name), fried prawn and some chicken thing that tastes like rubber. so yes, my attraction for meat is dwindling by the day. hoorah for my quest to be vegetarian (and ultimately, due to philosophical reasons, i do wish to become vegan).   my parents are out buying a laptop, which would potentially bring our computer count to five (a mac, one error-prone pc, and four "junkyard" class pcs). unfortunately, it runs windows. the thing is that although they know it's going to be virus-infested (they aren't very computer-smart), they insist on buying something with windows in it because it's "what i'll be using when i am working", and "that's what everyone is using".   (yes, large conglomerates have a lot of staying power these days.)  which is why i might be trying to put linux into it. i'm also going to try out cy's linux-loaded laptop for some time, and i'll report back another time.  still on the book list is a couple of jack london books (i finished three), a thackeray and one love novel that cy recommended (doubleplusungood writing, but very graphic!). there was also a net reading of a sherlock holmes story (i forgot which one it was) that i only caught a few sentences of. damn it. all right. time to do some study. bye.

      arghhh i've got a case of diarrhoea to deal with. something went wrong with my soup last night. or maybe it's because my latest vegetarian project has screeched to a halt for now, and roughage is getting rough on me.  me weak me lousy. me is heap fan of monty python. it is heap good.   oh yeah the guy who sits outside the used-to-be-when-short-guy-was-veep infamous conference room disappeared yesterday and a disgruntled office staff was calling really half-heartedly for him over school PA. well, he ought to: it's so lonely sitting there by yourself on a chair with a desk, reading your comics and watching five, six, seven hours fly by. (depends on your schedule, my timetable is the most punishing in the whole school, earliest day ends at 2.40pm.)   oh, and people constantly pointing at you and taunting you. sometimes you feel like pointing a finger (or two) back, but you're under the scrutiny of one block of classroom. who knows what lies beyond those windows and walls...

      anyway, i woke up a bit too late to go with two other people to see ex-interim-cane-wielder terz's (no comment on the net handle) pix at the shooting homes exhibition.   speaking of which i'm hungry again. is it that i'm finally piling on the centimetres? actually, i just post whenever i feel hungry. and the relative-imported bak chang isn't my cup of tea. what *is* my cup of tea is those lipton milk tea sachets. not too bad, actually, but could do with more flavour.   oh which reminds me: monty python's LIFE OF BRIAN is slated to rescreen in US theatres soon, and hopefully this also means a singapore screening. LIFE OF BRIAN is at least one of the most brilliant comedy movies of all time, although the entire movie is sort of anti-church. FINALLY! i hope the stupid censors don't remove anything. the news was received by a near fatal heart attack on cy's end of the telephone, followed by enough mad screaming on that end to turn me deaf had i not the good sense to distance myself from the headset at the time.   yeahhh! i'm a fist pumper. wooooo!!! i have a scream! YEEEEOWWWWW! that's enough for this week's dose of teenageristics.   and ah, chinese test. sure fail. even though i wrote down some words in pencil on my plastic desk cover (i try telling myself every night, to little avail, that every star student has cheated in at least fifteen class tests).   and no screw-up on making joseph tay's life a miserable hell. it's covered: his masculinity will be destroyed by guangrong extending his winning streak at his daily arm-wrestling match; his intelligence will be removed by some assorted pranks; and his integrity and honour stripped with some deft art. but joseph is a nice guy, ladies, really. except that his hands are very clubby indeed. he might just crush all of your fingers if you're interested in that dull hand-holding business. :)

      i am one of the many, many curious people on friendster now - that is, before they start charging as they once promised they would, with a grand total of three "friends", one of whom i know, and two others i don't really know at all.   class gathering was ok. at the risk of putting my friends, enemies and in-betweens, i shall give you, the undeserving reader on the web, a taste of what happened.   i got thrown into the pool and i didn't put up resistance, unlike cc who was screaming like a super-sized pimply baby as he was gang-dragged into harmless chlorine water (ha). we played water polo until some security guard came to enforce the law on our collective butts.   cc brought his "female good friend", became as quiet as a church mouse that has gone for a tonsil operation, and then got hauled into the pool as a punishment. it's not his fault. many boys lose their balls in front of a girl, how ironic (** see below). so would i, if i *had* a girlfriend in the first place. or a female friend, or something. anyway. joseph would have given his two front teeth to see cc reduced to nothing, or at least a non-talking shadow of his normal self. and malcolm would have been... well, his usual and more.   and later, we did an illegal, non-sexual activity. the point in time where a young, unknowing boy becomes a man is when he ______________, two to three years early. i am not, however, a ______-hound, so i am still, for the record, a boy. it's not smoking either. and it's not pornography.   marshmellows suck.   anyway, cy brazenly watched what she calls the "best episode ever" of monty python in my absence. i hate you so much now. ok, gtg mug bye  ** i know the expression may have set off some alarms at the  irony-enforcement police, but i think i have not abused the word "irony". consider the context.

      cy, her boyfriend, joe and i went to eat at a malay wedding yesterday afternoon. i dunno who the groom was, but n kindly invited us down to fill ourselves up. then i went to play football (association) and following that i hurt myself a bit. thanks. best lontong i've ever tasted in my life. i thought the one they sell at the malay store in school is pretty damn good already (the *only* thing good the stupid caterers sell), but it appears that whatever my maid cooks and passes off as lontong might be some alien milk formula.   oh, this is all very sad and sudden, but i am sixteen today. i have a $50 red packet and a pair of creative speakers. hate the wires. what i'd really like is a DAR, but speakers are just fine!   thanks to mich, cy and seng for early birthday wishes. no, i don't have a birthday cake at home waiting somewhere, 'cos 1) i don't really find birthday cakes very tasty; and 2) instead of asking my parents to get something which i'll only get 5% of and costs really little, i can get a more expensive gift that is 100% mine. i'm selfish, sue me.   i still don't have a girlfriend. awwww! that means cy has failed in her challenge to broker me a few choice females. which means a few more good meals at her expense. i'm thinking of going to an indian restaurant, wonder what they sell. and buy some good roti john. i've forgotten what it tastes like. and hum chim peng, or however you spell that, which i have a big time craving for. mmmmm. man, with food, you never need a girl. time to go eat something, bye

      yes, just in case you were wondering, my class profile thingy is a pic of the comic book guy, full-body. the slogan on his very ample tummy reads:   "veni vidi castratavi illegitimos" (all hail blackadder.)  chang thai didn't come to skool today. on *friday*, he ______ a bit more than he should have for our class gathering, and went to sleep one hour late early next morning (at 12), and appeared for our photography club meeting at nine looking worse than a panda in the last minutes of estrus. poor fellow. that'll teach him to fiddle with adulthood before he's due.   leonard goh is some ex-marist who's critiquing our pix now (fotolog.net/langren) - and his pix, he says, are done with a pretty rudimentary, 18-shot, portable camera. urban legend, too: he's one of the lucky chaps who got stuck with robert for two years.   of course, on a previous instalment, i had some bad things to say about my cca teacher (the tirade has since been removed). but the deal is fair: she doesn't seem to interested in photography (yes, i know what sepia is), and neither am i enchanted with spending 2 hours every week chatting with orange boy and insulting teachers, so we're quits.   okay bye

      badminton day. my fitness and conditioning (that is, a module where they make the fat, weak and unfit sweat less than they would if they did a sport they like,  tsk !) days are coming. because i failed my 2.4km run. and that, because i walked half the way...  obligatory simpsons quote:  "edna [krabappel] is sleeping blissfully under the many folds of my spiderman t-shirt." -- comic book guy after he got laid by mrs k. scene pans onto a naked mrs k, more than completely covered by a spiderman t-shirt belonging to a very gut-ample man indeed.  obligatory class profile quote:  "glee is wat i give =)" -- ajy  feh. tomorrow is our skoolz sports day. yeah, i'm very enthusiastic about cheering on a bunch of dimwits i don't know personally and i don't care two horn sounds about. or i should really tone down that remark because i've been a bit too antagonistic as of late.

      gr and i were eating at the canteen, *and* he was making amorous noises at this fairly good looking teacher who was wearing a *somewhat* translucent, tight fitting white dress and seated a table away, twisting her fork this way and that to grab her food. sexy. not voluptuous, more bamboo-like with a slight tushie afterthought.   amorous indeed.   of course, what happened was we saw one of those portable massagers lying rather harmlessly on our class table.   "that's a dildo," gr said, making funny chortling noises.   "that's a vibrator," i said, and i scooped more grass jelly into my nose.   then gr approached the massager and fumbled for a switch, and true to its word it vibrated. purred. it had "implicate me and that cute teacher" written all over it.   which we did. and gr is truly a great dirt disher, and a humble pink massager became a guilty pleasure for at least two minutes, punctuated by loud hoots from all quarters. whether it's been between someone's thighs or not, that's something i don't want to know: a couple of people put the massager to their crotches and their faces and noses, as if wanting a piece of fem-dom... it was a pink massager for that extra credibility. that was by total coincidence.  right. i have to go now. bye.

      i have fired off a sanitised version of that tirade yesterday to mediacorpse; just in case you don't believe me, here's a  urlLink screenshot . that's from my "sent" mailbox. they'll never reply, i suspect.  goodbye.

      my revision is advancing at a very fast rate indeed: about 0.   yeah for fruit juice.   mediacorp tv is giving away prizes for your  urlLink "frank" emails  about its television programming. here's mine.      dear mediacorpse,  your company is a major fuckup. let me qualify that in several, easy to read passages.   one, while i have no objections to your broadcasts of american shows, do refrain from copying "wheel of fortune" when all you can afford are cheapskate prizes. at least invent your own cheapo gameshows.   two, nobody wants half a million rock concerts, and nobody wants half a million britney spears/linkin park concerts, except all the braindead jackasses in singapore (and that amounts to only about 40% of us, and that's only a modest estimate). also, rock music isn't everything.   three, using the very left-wing FOX NEWS for your iraqi war coverage isn't very telling of the brains running your fine corporation. i'm also sure that CNA deployed FOX NEWS for the last US presidential election coverage. that's just plain stupid.   four, your ratings war with SPH mediawoks is both infantile and futile. quit the shit. everyone knows SPH mediawoks will quit once they lose too much money (although, yes, they've got a lot of money in the bank).    five, don't bother with the english sitcoms. while our locally produced chinese shows are the epitome of "seven evening eight evening cry father cry mother" - the variety shows are about 90% screaming, and the dramas about 90% crying - the english shows are the new epitome of "crap". why don't you support our arts scene and broadcast one of those plays instead?   six, if you are really sincere about art central's "comedy night", put it on a prime time slot *every* night.   seven, quit the "soccer" thing. first of all, it's "association football". if we can live with calling the game *not* played with a spherical football "american football" (incidentally, a better name to describe that sport would be "futile rampaging"), we sure can live without that stupid american coinage.   eight, 70% of singaporeans might be chinese, but 20% are *not* chinese. i think that's a minority large enough not to ignore with your stupid, fantastically timed chinese shows on your so-called tv mobile (many bus drivers are so sick of it, they just don't bother turning it on any more).   your choice of television programming, whether it is intended or not, is stifling, confusing and stupidifying us, as you can see from the construction of this very sentence (caused by watching five minutes of your rather inferior news show). it has very obviously stemmed from negligence and stupidity. the fact that you people actually won something at the asian television awards thing is only a testament to the inferiority of asian programming, sad to say.   yours,  a  very  disgruntled part-time viewer

      i have a case of diarrhoea. the only curse i have for that is crap. crap crap crap. that's all i'll have to do until 9pm.   my revision isn't going on well at all. with any luck i'll do biology and then it's out for a korean restaurant outing with cy and j. i never remember the names of the dishes, and i hate anchovies.   just like how i forgot the word "palindrome" all of a sudden in the past two days, and i kept writing "aibohphobia" (not the "official" word for the fear of palindromes) until it kind of came back.   heap good. okay, i got to go now. bye.

      today we had english remedial from i think 2.40pm to 4.10pm... and i think i've learned more in that one session than i have in six months. yes, we get almost nothing done in english class thanks to a lot of people in my english group. at the very least they don't keep chattering in mandarin (argh).   oh. i'm the lowest in class for chinese oral, having failed chinese oral by a mark for having absolutely no ideas on how to marshall and express my thoughts in chinese. i'm the only kid to have failed oral in the entire level, i think. jarrrrr.   it's really not my fault that we don't speak a word of chinese at home: we're straits chinese people, we handle our chilli well (usually), and we don't really like cheenapiangs (not to say that they like us either). and our desserts are really fantastic, i swear.  yarr. i have to eat.

      i have a gmail.com account. miles better than that hotmail trash.  today was a pretty bad day, but i guess it'd suck more if i wrote about it.   jesh: i don't know dom su that well. the details of my dealings with dom are as follows: i got into the same bus as him one day, his friend kept raving about him. that's it. sorry to have given you false hopes. ha.   oh, and GR stole (and adorned his initials on) a "meow wif clashnicough" printout that kenn laboured so hard to make (for our class tree, with our wonderful class profile drawings hanging on the branches). kenn, of course, made fairly pained sounds for the duration of the three periods after lunch break, and vowed to take revenge.    cy has also been fairly interested to know about the state of my friendster foray. here it is: i have nine "friends". all the males on the list are my classmates, and all the females are lormee's and kenn's mutual friends. yup, i'm a stud. you little flirty thing, you. all of this when other people have in the region of 100 friends.   ahem. in response to terz's retort in my gbook...  0. i wasn't driving at anarchy, grand gala dinners, or whatever it is... i'm just bitching about money (although i'll admit that i'm not in the position to do so). but the school could do better than splurge on the wrong things and then make pretty pathetic appeals to everyone to donate our precious clams for them to make even more financial gaffes.   1. you're right about the jacuzzi.   2. you sound more than annoyed about the get-away thing... and i apologise, since i now recall having seen the annual get-away pix on the school archives (really, boxes and boxes of photographs nobody wants to see again). or i shouldn't type things at the spur of the moment.   3. yes, i use a tastefully expensive mac at home. (i am typing this entry on one now.) if the savings from buying cheap, commodity pcs can translate to, say, funding that will benefit the students (or, to give it a more selfish spin, ME) better, i'll live with microsoft.     and, anyway, powerpoint slide lessons are  urlLink essentially useless . which i was tempted to talk about, but that wired magazine article (linked) speaks for itself.   4. i'll get over myself when i leave this school. i really will. thanks for the reminder.

      um, hoorah for teh tarik. ok today's lunch menu: chicken herbal soup, fried bee hoon (the usual... blah), some icy fruit mint drink. and then a nap. and then i wake up, eat a tuna + egg sandwich, do my biology homework, nap.   third cycle. i think i'm going to have another dig at the bee hoon.   in other news:  mother: pepper doesn't go well with fried bee hoon. me: that's opinion.   then mother goes into a lengthy discussion on how argumentative i am, how i'll get retribution when my children do the same to me, etc etc. oh mother - i'll be less of a "son" if i were a yes-boy. adolescent children are supposed to argue and scream and yell at their parents for no obvious reason at all, not to give in to arguments like a baby.   of course, my idea of an argument is a two-word semi-retort. i've long since given up trying to argue with them for more than an exchange or two, because all parents think they're undisputedly right even though logic, common sense and the laws of physics go against them in every way sometimes. or, perhaps, just older parents.   yeah, i rulez. bye.

      "every sound is a comeback, every moment is a little bit later"  highlight of this week must be the ongoing scgs-anderson catfight. no, i don't understand this school spirit business, what more with two people who have not met before slinging mud at each other... all in the name of school.  the problem is that things are never that romantic. at maris stella, students are frequently screwed. they care more about frosting the fucking glass panels on the staircase to the office more than they do about an ailing LCD projector in the class (putting a stop to many of those stupid lessons where they stuff a million words per slide for reading pleasure), a dead wall clock, or the bee nest that's on the roof just above my classroom (we're on the top floor).   yes, a fucking bee nest. action? none. and when a stupid aircon unit sputters (or threatens to sputter) to bring the staff room air temperature up by some notches, some guy comes almost immediately to twiddle the compressor.  oh, the air-con men come frequently to twiddle with the inverters. and the teachers all have a yearly getaway to heaven knows where. and the teachers openly defy all sanctions not to invade the eternally superior (and eternally cheaper) primary school canteen before 1pm, because they're not students and they don't apply for students-only oppression and rules and sanctions.   i'll just take that teachers who dye their hair, dress skimpily and routinely refer to students as animals (i know of some teachers who do) count under "essential conditions that will differentiate the teacher from the students". because, apparently, if the teacher were roundly reminded that he or she was probably not much different from choice animal due to genetic makeup and animal-like behaviour, said student would face a public apology, caning and a suspension. at the least.   oh, i can't *wait* to leave this stupid shithole of a school.  just remember, marists, when you go for that leavers' day dinner, that the money they could have used to give you international cuisine at a good hotel has gone into a jacuzzi, a yearly teachers-only get-away, air-conditioners and tastefully expensive iMacs on every teachers' desk (we can't use our class iMacs).   and the frosting on the glass panels of the staircase to the office.  all at the cost of student safety (if some TWIT from my class dares to poke the hive with a bamboo pole, and there are some), at student education, yadda yadda.   i have to go drown my anger with a bit of midnight snack now. bye.

      Well, days after that "beating my kids just because I'm a failure at managing them" saga, a voice of reason has come... and more than a little late. That, too, on Life!, that lousy, no-gooding celeBritish (tm) paper - see today's edition, page six. Now and then, something worth reading, and they trivialise it... just to keep in line with populist theory.   Now playing: Soundhack by Forrs. I like it.   Will Buckley on the Guardian:  urlLink Football is a childish pursuit...  an inconsequential, faux-patriotic sport.   Well, sort of. Depends on what aspect you are in pursuit of. Enjoying football because one can be one of many David Beckham admirers must be about as smart as listening to, say, Linkin Park -  who, like that article so eloquently says about Diana and Becks, "share a cookery O Level between them".   Geography is pretty fun, actually. Now let me be one of those top-five-school nerds who, out of the sheer perceived cool factor, insert assorted biology or geography terminology in their blog posts. Grrrrr. Okay, here goes nothing: I have been fertilising my brain with herbal chicken soup and undergoing some half-hearted industrialisation. Soon I shall be integrated with the ground as coal.

      Before I go off and study, um, I'm having a bit of an eating problem recently. I keep biting my !@##@#$-ing tongue, and this latest one isn't any exception. Now I've got a hole on my tongue and it's all yellow inside. !@#!@#!@#. I can't eat without pain, and I can't talk without hurting the thing.  Or like the previous time, where I bit a healing tongue ulcer, which bled and aggravated the problem. I have to drink a cold drink with every meal, every snack I have. GAHHHHHHHH  I ought to stop Frenching so much. Stupid bitch keeps biting my tongue. I still love you... my money. Shouldn't have blown my bucks on Portuguese egg tarts. So addictive.   Okay, time to hit the books, and pop a Coke if there's spare change around. Bye.

      Wassup. I've been busy getting Chinese current affairs essays into context. Hate it.   BBC says that women with hourglass figures are  urlLink more fertile , which is synonymous with "Western views of beauty". Tomorrow, women with hairless armpits are more intelligent... not.  Also:  urlLink is it in anyone to abuse a captive?  One sentence in that article will sum up why I am not sanguine about letting teachers do anything they like to students: "...absolute power corrupts absolutely." There is this exclusive i'll-trust-some-stressed-out-adult-who-could-give-less-of-a-damn-to-discipline-my-kid-fairly mentality of parents in Singapore, out of what, convenience?   And, more revealingly, teachers don't have any more time to care about students than their fucking lazy parents do. Time for my tirade on caning students, I can't stand it anymore:  How much time would you have for one student if you have to teach 200 students a week - and see each student only for 1 to 3 hours during that time? Eh, it's an absolute given that students aren't perfect. Neither are teachers. Teachers aren't superhuman.  Yup, two hours of time a week to show a kid some love, discipline, and simultaneously earn his or her respect.  And about beating kids, I'll say again that, while I haven't got any alternative solutions (hence the subdued resignation to fate), caning isn't the be-all-end-all to all things. We're civilised people here. A painful, physical deterrent translates to absolutely nothing in our protected world. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for life. But you can't teach a man to fish if you pelt stones at him for whatever shortcoming, can you? Ever wonder why we lack social grace? Because we think Michael Fay is going back to Yank Land with cane scars on his ass and never ever do a naughty thing again. (They don't flog naughty kids in America, just shove them into luxurious state-paid prisons with television sets and beds.)  Why have children? To be part of a national statistic? Joy -- in all knowledge that he or she will grow up in fifteen years just to shout at you and make you life miserable?   I've seen  six-year-olds  scream at their mom to shut up, and they haven't started full-time schooling yet. Where do we pull these things from, our asses? These things don't surface as genetically or magically as we'd all like to think they do.  Stop blaming us for what our shortcomings. And the teachers aren't to blame -- what right do you have over two hundred students that your fucking kid should be preferentially cared for?  To put everything I've been so painfully trying to say into context:  Singaporean parents are failures. They are the real wimps and the whiny slobs.    Let's have a national campaign to breed us kids right. You never have that, instead you have futile campaigns to rid our pidgin English. The gov't, let's face it, can't force us to have kids. If you don't want to, don't. Don't give a chance to a kid to come into this world to regret so and hate you for your own shortcomings as a parent if you don't see the need to change them.   Of course, kids have many shortcomings, all of which have been covered in great, absolutely one-sided detail by moaning adults on the newspapers.

      On a  urlLink blog : "A baby sitter is a teenager acting like an adult while the adults are out acting like teenagers."   urlLink bbcwatch.com  monitors the BBC for bias.   As expected FOX has given in to the Simpsons voice actors' demands.   I have just got to study. I haven't passed a Geography test in forever, there is an E Maths test next week on "everything" - and I got 600 for my Maths SAT (for a total of 1480). Shit.   C and I spent an hour or so eating some really great Portuguese egg tarts - they don't really look or taste too different from the usual egg tarts, but it's better in a way I cannot exactly describe. Good with tea, mainly because it's sweet. And, as George Orwell says in his  urlLink guide to drinking tea , always Indian tea.   I've read all the essays on that list. All are good.  "The problem of language is subtler and would take too long to discuss. I will only say that of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more exactly. In any case I find that by the time you have perfected any style of writing, you have always outgrown it."  Robin-Hoodish to Impressionalist to... well, Orwellian.

      As you may or may not be able to see, I have resorted to typing with some capital letters for a start... and whenever imagination permits, I shall have a good title to use for my blog entries.   It's six in the morning and I have been up since, well, eleven am yesterday. I can tell you what I did not do: view pornography (and related exercise), play Tony Hawk, have more than five mugs of coffee (actually, three instant  teh tarik  drinks), try keepie-uppie, or even spend my time reading a whole slew of BBC programme essays and Wikipedia articles.   Perfectly healthy hobbies, really, if you don't attempt them too early and too often.  Coffee is a diuretic. Pornography has spawned everything from rapists to perverts. And Wikipedia is making every Netizen an American, one at a time; what a fucking good ploy. I'll just eat a shortbread.   It's quite hard typing with capitals for a change; partly because things look "cooler" when it's all small letters, and partly because I'm just too damn lazy. It's the "style" of the cool cats who dip their philosophical brush in the politics bucket and aerate their ears with the, um, dragon's-breath sound of Radiohead synths. Neither of which I do to justify continuing typing in small letters. I am still, however, a fucking lazy butthole.   Oh, seven o'clock. And then a couple of tuna sandwiches, and then a mug of milk or sparkling red juice if we have it, and the sound of ice boulders as they drop and clink the sparkling glass to dramatic effect (currants... mmm), and then off I drift with the marlins as we annoy the prawns, and where the currents are always warm. (I'm  not  talking about peeing onto my hand, it's - um - something deep and abstract that you losers will never ever get. MUAHAHAHAHA!) And penguins... I'll get to them one day.

Think of it as this year's equivalent to the White Stripes' "Elephant." It's going to garner enormous reviews and all your cool buddies will listen to it while getting stoned this summer."

      What is it about me and hawkers? I had this urge to part with my money after the exam today (yup, it really is our easiest physics prelim in  at least  the last five yrs) and get cheated at McDonald's again, but I turned back at the last corner to find a radish cake stall (or carrot cake, or whatever).   What the heck is wrong about me buying a $3 plate of radish cake (sans sweet sauce; that thing gets on my nerves) and waiting patiently while *they* serve a million people who ordered after i did? They were pointing at me with wrinkled fingers as if I couldn't afford to pay.  But don't worry: the guy who fries the radish cake probably has his gonads - and his generative ability - suitably fixed by the wonders of fate, karma and thermodynamics. And the lady - probably the wife - who thinks I'm really funny probably earns some extra cash posing as a rabbit, what with her buck teeth and all. In the buff. Or, on hindsight, maybe with a fig leaf in the way. Some things ought not to be seen, not even by a spouse.   Here I am, one of the few,  few  student-age customers who can get sick of hamburgers, glad to exchange service for cash, and there you have some impotent, balding dude and his buck-toothed wife chortling away in the face of impending misfortune. Or, since I'm cursing them, just another bad episode in a long queue of disasters. Maybe tomorrow the stall will collapse.   Maybe I'll go eat at McDonald's some day. At least I've got a manager to complain to. And you wonder why Singaporeans are such evil consumers...

      Physics is tomorrow. My Physics teacher - who, if it's of any interest, recommends that we write everything in past tense to "improve answer quality" - says it's going to be a break in tradition - that is, the paper will be easy. I'll quote something he wrote in one of his gawdy, full-of-typewriter-effects Powerpoint slides: "the greatest the friction, the greatest the force".   Told you: Microsoft Powerpoint is evil.   Never trust my school for an easy physics paper. Maybe it's because they've run out of questions - they got so desperate at our EOY last year that they just pulled out questions from the A Level ten years series from chapters somewhat outside the syllabus. Oh, and if difficult questions won't fail us, tough marking will, as per tradition.    urlLink Naps are the best way to stay awake for long periods of time.   Very true, I swear to that. Still, I love my tea.   Gah. I haven't eaten yet. Time to raid the fridge. Bye.

      Did you notice the almost casual way that the ST's science correspondent dismissed all human cloning scientists as "rogues"? (It's not on the website, but it's definitely in the first few pages, because it's the very first news article I read today.) Moral cop, government policy, or just plain bad syntax? I'll pick moral cop for obvious reasons.  No, I still have 1000 Chinese  ci yu  left to passively memorise. What a waste of time.

It just wouldn't make a difference if I tried. Maybe it's because I'm stupid, but more because in the end something's going to give. Like impossibly strict marking is going to kick our prelim L1R5 to fucking hell.   I have to go pore through my Bio again.

      Chinese O Levels, woohoo. Honestly, none of us are expecting good results. Let's see: out of 375 of last year's June session takers, ~20 got A2s and above - seven percent. Mathematically, what are the chances that the lousiest kid in Express Chinese in the entire level gets minimum C6? (Not being very ambitious here.)   Anyway, that psycho PLMGSS girl came to annoy me this morning (I think it's the same one who's annoyed GR and Arthur repeatedly). The nearest bus stand from my house is, unforch, right in front of the school gate, and the next nearest one is about 200-250 metres away.   She targets only people from my school. And she only speaks in Mandarin. I now regret not learning from G how to say "fuck off, you stupid bitch" in Beiyu.   And if you think "bitch" is rude and unqualified, I'll say that this girl uses at least one expletive to every human being who has the courtesy to say hi to her every morning. (Except me, but I was the victim, and was consequently exempt.) And, of course, including her lower secondary friend from my school.   Pleasant as a crow with weak intestines. Now I've got to wake up extra early so I won't get to see that maggot again. DIE, DIE, DIE. I hope beetles eat your flesh in your sleep and the tooth fairy never, ever visits you.

      I found local playwright Alfian bin Sa'at's  urlLink secret "wank shed"  (on diaryland). The current entry really is pretty dirty, but I swear I found the link from  urlLink new sintercom , and not because I was searching for gay porn (homophobic tinge not intended). Solid, interesting, endearing. And, if only for one post, dirty.   Ah, anyway, Biology P1 tomorrow. And Chinese O Levels in about two weeks. Anyway, my Chinese teacher told Joseph's dad during a PTM that his best hope was for a C5 grade, and he wasn't the only guy to fail Chinese oral. (In case it eludes you, I have that distinguished honour.)   Everyone's so happy...

      Some guy at Pitchfork  urlLink spent a week  on the Avril Lavigne E-Team!   To thank her 60000-odd rabid maniac E-Teamers, she appears on a cute video: "Thank you for all of your e-mails and calls to 'TRL' and [Canadian music channel] 'MuchMusic' which helped me get to #1 on both,  which in turn increased record sales... "   I think I've got a crush on this Avril Lavigne girl. Eh, a female faux-rocker with economic sense. What more could you ask for? Wait. Don't answer that.

      I've got an eyelash stuck in my eye, and for the past fifteen mins I've been trying to get it out with wet tissue paper. What? Playing with your eyes like that? It's under approval by webmd.com, and thank goodness it's not even in the sclera itself.    Unfortunately, the dispensed advice isn't of much help, the wet tissue paper can cling onto said lash when it is, say, completely on the sclera or on the eyelid. Mine is in the middle of nowhere. It's tucked inside the bloody lid, and no amount of probing is going to work.   And I don't know where the eyedrops are. Mama, come back now. Or at least don't remove the eyedrop bottle from my room.  Or, maybe, in the next five minutes, I'll magically blink it out. Yeah, that's what will happen. A miracle.

      My Chinese isn't going on fine at all. But I got my highest grade for letter-writing at today's remedial... ever. Nah. It's purely a rally-the-troops mark.   Oh, and I haven't done a single mock paper yet. Or even touched my Chinese ten-years-series. Because I haven't finished learning (okay, blatantly memorising) the vocabulary yet. Hate it. Hate it so much.    I finished the Physics worksheets pretty quickly (most of it in class, I finished up the last question just now). It isn't the most difficult thing in the world but it's fun for once. First time I've used a capital sigma for a school assignment, at least.   We also have a Chemistry project that is so boring, five minutes of Google will settle it.   And et cetera.

      By some stroke of luck I found my verification slip - ticket to the examination hall this Monday. And you know, I've already paid half a bloody grand for a bunch of bald Cambridgers to play dice with my fate. What else do you want?   At the bloody least, inform us  the day we receive it , not wait until it's two days from the O Levels and then start reminding us to search our Piles of Papers Generously Provided By the School for them. Thank you, multi-tasking & efficient civil servants.   You can see the school brimming in thoughtfulness in the following ways:  1. In the space of ten days, we have to carry our tables and chairs to and from the classroom, twice.   2. Some classes, like mine, do not have a single break day during the course of the examinations, and immediately after the papers are returned... Chinese lessons.   3. The very day *after* our bloody O Levels, we've got holiday lessons. Wow. Way to go.   Well, we got two lollypops to suck on today and our affable veep gave a hearty "I wish I could give you all my luck" speech. Yeah, that's some kind of a remedy.   My life is relentless. In a few hours I've got Chinese remedial. 8.30am. And it's really really late now, but I can't sleep and I slept the whole afternoon anyway.   Gahhh. Bye.

FOUR  To reward me for working on my Chinese compo two nights ago, cranky, dopey-eyed and everything, here are some very well-deserved marking comments by Ms Chinese Teacher.    ...???????????   Which may mean one of these three things, if my years of Chinese has served me well:  1. You're crap at Chinese, which is exactly *why* I gave you that assignment! Haw haw haw. I'm kidding, but I'm giving you some kind of false hope at least. Credit me.    2. You're crap at Chinese. I betcha you got someone to dictate the whole thing to you.   3. You're crap at Chinese.

      Today's top three signs that I ought to prepare for junior college now:   3. Two ex-students appear in NYJC garb to pretty much sidestep everything about the academic side of getting into a junior college and jump into ex-student girlfriend statistics.   2. VJC has six mass dances a year. Also, the girls have their 2.4km run first and stick along the sidelines to cheer boys on for the last 60 metre stretch. Dig the postcards.   1. "Hey, Marist, hehehe, you've got chocolate all over your mouth."  On the other hand, ah, it's hardly worth it, and I've got more common sense than to blow a hundred bucks on a prom when that money can go towards a fine meal at a good restaurant.

I love Google's Gmail...  urlLink really really intuitive , and it's going to be a charm for one of my holiday hobbies (anyone interested).   Yeah, I flunked both maths miserably (E8, F9), thank you  urlLink Jeremy  for rubbing it in. L1R5: 23 (above average, as far as I know). Oh, and my physics teacher, for the fourth time (out of the four occasions he's marked our test papers) that I've been screwed out of one grade. Yeah, he gots a problem with me.    It's 1.15am. And there's "intensive Chinese lesson" later. Bloody right. Hate it. Goodbye.

      Five things:   WANT  Mmm I love my bed. I managed to do only my fifth power nap ever. I want an alarm clock, sailor. So I can actually wake up and remember my sweet dream and hit myself on the head in reproach because I'll never get something as good as it again.    TOOL  My mother's new NEC Versa is fucking problematic. For the second time in the row it won't detect our wireless network properly. Why can't Windows machines and hardware specially made for Windows not work properly? I dunno.    TREAT  Kenn should loan me his book of "everything". I'm gonna demolish that in a day or two. I know of a guy who finished a Tolkien in about one and a half days, and still had time to go online and have a retaurant dinner and such. Nerdo.    FOD(DER)  I was planning to eat laksa at that stall again, but ah, it's six-thirty, dammit. By the time I get home it's going to be dark and the bats will chew on my toes.

      Part one of my cross interview with CY (partly shamelessly ripped off from the Guardian's famous Small Talk section).   (Edit: There won't be a part two, though. Mainly because my questions were too boring. I bet the woman cheated on the Tory question. Nobody ever gets the Tory thing right, let alone tell between right and left wing.)   In British currency, how much does a pint of milk cost? What is that in Singapore currency?  I am a metric person, and I don't buy milk. I don't bloody know.    A lion and a tiger are fighting. Who wins and why?  Are both healthy? Do they have equally sharp teeth? Am I the only spectator? What are their sexes?   Yes, yes and yes. Both male.  Then the tiger wins... unless the lion is unmarried, in which case the lion will be so crazed as to visualise the tiger as a female lion and...   Okay okay. What is the air-speed velocity of an African swallow?  Laden or unladen?   What changes will come our way in the next generation?  Fundamentally, zero. Idiots will continue to exist, proliferate and fight over: religion, politics, money, people who like people of the same sex, Jews, and China. Because China has always been a troublemaker, right throughout their history. Sort of. And, half of these problems will persist because Americans will consistently vote for presidents with extremely low IQs.    What colour and type of underpants do you have on?  Dark blue briefs.    Name five jobs you'd love to have in your life.  Probably write a column for a magazine, or write sitcoms, be a theoretical physicist, be the next Dalai Lama, and most likely be a drunken, fat lout.    What is the biggest problem with the world?  That we are all cockups.   That's a really detailed answer. What is the one sitcom you're curious about?  Dennis Miller show. One day I'll watch it. Hopefully.    You've watched enough of it to know... are there any good Seinfeld-the-sitcom quotes at all?  George's "I can't carry a pen, I'm afraid it'll puncture my scrotum" is the only one I can think of.

      Slackfest before the physics practical mock paper. Someone brought a Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? book and I BSed my way right through to the £250 000 question. I blew that question on a wrong interpretation of "quid pro quo". And that one I was supposed to know because I was reading it on Wikipedia in between my Albinoblacksheep.com video fest. (Thanks Kenn... this is so much better than that MTV crap.)  Going out for footie later.   Update: offensive football rant removed. I got a chip from 20m that clattered the makeshift goalposts - which had been moved half a minute earlier - and counts as "not on target".  Today's stats: 10-15 tackles (75% success) 1 attempt on goal, 1 attempt not on target 3 assists 4 very unconvincing runs, 2 successful 7 critical passes 2 very crappy crosses about 70% successful passes

      Boy have the lessons been boring. Just about everyone I don't know in my English group skipped English remedial yesterday... and of course, tomorrow's as well. Come to think of it, 1 hr to talk about about six basic grammatical errors is a bit long.   We saw some mynah on the road after school, dead. It was a pretty clean death, no mauled limbs or anything, just a piece of bird meat coming from somewhere near the human equivalent of the ass and kidney region. It looked like it had a tummyache though, with the humanoid wing and everything.   Why I think that if I ever get to earn a lot of dough, I'll do a Phillip Torrone: "i usually never go to bed until 3am or so..."

      Some person filed a USPTO  urlLink patent  for a peanut butter sandwich.   Why a totally uncool Microsoft employee  urlLink became  an "impractical, elitist hipster", wait, I mean, culturally superior. Whatever, dude.   Samsung means  urlLink to come . A really dirty story.   Apparently, we've got lessons on Saturday.   I've lost a lot of my Bio stuff so I don't have an answer key to my holiday assignments. Sounds like I've got to: 1) photocopy someone's entire bio file, which is about as thick as my English file, and you know what our English teacher is like; or 2) slack four weeks the way I always do and then come to school to copy everything.   G's Primary 4 sister is really cute and everything, but she's got all the usual inclinations of "bitch". I'll keep it short, because at the end of it all I had to surrender two Mars bars. Two-point-five bucks... which makes this girl the first female I've spent more than a buck on in my entire life. (My mom and sis collaborated to swindle me of two bucks, but that's ok.) Thanks, that could've gone to fattening me up for winter hibernation, but apparently you fear for my obesity. Love you, darl. Ahem.   My adventures with da mugus aren't going too well, but I've heard it's "exactly like sex".

       Well, I suspected it: today's Chinese paper didn't exactly reward the legions of crazy people who mugged for it. It's becoming a bit like English - that is, you're still as likely to ace it even if you don't study, except that they're asking you for your "opinion" on almost everything. You can pretty much get away in English without an opinion, like much of Hemingway's work if you don't read it "right".   No time to rest now, because tomorrow and Wednesday are effectively school days - but much better than what we're getting usually. It's just 7.40pm to 2.10pm for tomorrow. Three straight days of English (!!!) and Biology and two hours of Chemistry lab tomorrow. And, as usual, many hours with my Physics teacher.   I'm well started on my holiday interest. Anyone who knows what I'm doing and is interested to help out is invited! Potentially fun, games and all that. Unethical my a..a...albumen. Buhbye.

And... an atheist offers to start believing in God; a straw hat; Stanford, Harvard & Princeton acceptance letters; a signed Weezer backstage pass; a recorded crank call to any number; lingerie; sea-shells; digital camera; a week of free drinks at a Barcelona bar; a real mouse.    Yes. I have a Gmail account - but I used up one invite... I think I'm going to plump for the Olympic Games ticket. We'll see how much it chalks up on eBay.

The stupid internet connection was down from 4pm until just now in my area. This is just fucking stupid. This is just retarded.   I woke up from my afternoon nap drooling. And then I watched a couple of Simpsons episodes at home, and I bum-ded at G's to watch more cable TV. Love Discovery. Oh, I still remember the time Maya brought a tape recording of a documentary on the Mayans to Mavis klazzz and Arthur + Kenneth + me had a field day.   Woo, boredom. I really like it though. Tomorrow F and I are going to wake up at seven and watch the old folk dancing to the commands of a female voice saying "inhale, exhale" many many times and eat at the nearby hawker centre or something. And if I can, try to remember where they sell the most damn tasty soybean milk in the entire estate.    If  I don't sleep too late...

       urlLink Manhattanhenge ... and  urlLink USA terror alerts , Ashcroft style.   My neck and back hurts after yesterday's not-too-good trip to the Wet Water World thing. It sucks. I had three rides on the really high slide thing, the only highlight of the day. It's a V-shaped ramp and they release you on one end and as you fly down with great velocity like a sneeze, while clutching the handles tight. It was heartstopping the first two times, at least.   But $12.50 + $8 for three rides and a bust of mediocrity... well, that's worth nothing. Well, I did get to touch a lot of things today. I just pretty much got into the way, that's all. Among these I had a (very accidental) handful of this gangster's girlfriend's butt, which earned me a total of one very menacing look.   And I'm supposed to play football later, which I will probably have to give a miss because my back is really bothering me. Which leaves me with the option of catching today's Blackadder festival at G's, although I've seen all three episodes before. At least I can lounge on the couch. I love being a couch potato.   Mmmm.

      I went to watch  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  with Kenn and Joseph. (GR excused himself to bye his parents off to LA... apparently, Kenn's dad is captaining this flight!)  It's a fun movie, yes, but utterly mediocre. Your typical American movie, really, all action, zero character development, over-simple plot. But you gotta love the special effects.   Let's ignore the thing that half of America squeeze into Mexico and live fairly happily in spite of losing all their money and land.    NYT says it right: "The glacierization of half of the world's inhabited land is contemplated with barely a hint of horror. In fact, it looks kind of cool."  It could have been redeemed if the main characters perished. You know, like in Orwell's 1984.

      Quote of the day: "Look, let's can the euphemisms. No more bullspit." - Principal Skinner on the episode I saw yesterday  I didn't go to school today. Woohoo! Rest day. I haven't eaten anything yet though. No brunch. What I want, though, is to demolish the coffee chiffon thing and a couple of otah. What goes best with otah, orange juice or Coke?   Btw, Coke really works for ulcers. I dunno why. Mother always says I'm bluffing her but it's really true.    urlLink Bill Joy , millionaire computer scientist crusading against risk: "I was going through the books [film guides] and found out there are only about 2,000 movies in history in which there's critical consensus that they're really good... so I bought 600 of them."   Now ask me what I want to be when I grow up. Just ask me that again....   Haven't you ever noticed that the Americans who actually have opinions of substance come from New York?

      I'm in a partnership with this Nigerian cockup to get some percentage of his US$80 million fortune. Ok, not. I'll try to sum up his bullshit as well as I can:  1. This kiddo, let's call him Asshat, has a private number with a Nigerian prefix (I dodge the "we must talk by phone" clause citing church policy). His sister is living in another African country - I'm lazy to check out the relevant Gmail label here - but I think it's Togo. They have cashflow problems but thanks to me they're going to be $60mil richer. Soon. Soon.   2. Asshat wants to meet me in Amsterdam, but his sister is critically ill (uh-oh). In spite of this, he *still* prefers his airplane ticket to his sister, so I suggest to use his plane ticket money for her treatment while I fund his travel expenses. I also provide a very, very special prayer. Here's a line: "May the stickiness of a million adolescents find their way down your blessed throats."  3. Two days after I've sent the generous package, Asshat has not only checked his sister into a first class hospital, she is also miraculously recovering thanks to the superior effects of my well-crafted prayer. (No side effects of swallowing too much adolescent seed though.) Aren't they staying in different countries?   4. Now I've got to give him travel expenses, but suggests that I forward the money to his accountant. What am I, daft? Remember, Asshat said he has no money, not even enough to buy a fucking plane ticket.   Yup. There's one more thing to add to my resume.

      Indoor football yesterday. Quite incredible, except that I scuffed a great chance from a metre out. We lost all our matches. But it was to opposition that can run faster, read the game superbly, and have better teamwork. But we'll learn.   I have to stop drinking something during my meals. I had three cups of Milo today to starve off my simultaneous addictions to Coca-Cola, orange juice *and* a water chestnut drink. Grumble.  The quest for video streaming has come to a very, very fast end: VideoLAN has it  urlLink inbuilt , and only requires a 4 Mbit/s connection to work. All of us at the Blackadder Video Party have VideoLAN - why didn't we figure this out earlier? Oh,  urlLink this .   Well, in the past few days, people have been uncovering a lot of bullshit from Fox. Especially Bill O'Reilly, who has the gall to dismiss NYT and the BBC for "misleading reporting". Well, I thought you were having an anti-terrorism war here. Fox has less credibility than an over-used debit card.

      Well, my mugus will have to wait if they're going to meet me in Amsterdam. Too bored to carry on with this bullshit.   And I've got a tummy ache. Bother. Me, I still cannot find that soy bean milk store. Oh, and today: I had a goal and another that would have been a top left curler - if we had real goalposts. Otherwise I didn't have much to do.   I spent most of the morning at G's who was showing me this  urlLink particularly interesting  piece of software. The page says Microsoft is ripping it off, as they always have. It's a dashboard and you type a query, for instance my name into the box, and it brings up all the e-mails, photos of me, my latest blog entries, ICQ messages I may have ever sent you, etc.   Which brings us to the next generation of cyber stalking. Was pretty creepy the first time I saw it.   This is like Gmail's filtering feature thing on a cocktail of steroids. It's quite awesome if you're doing 419 baiting and have to deal with 20-30 people simultaneously and got to deal with all the pics of themselves in compromising positions and fake contracts and faxes and voicemails and summaries of their lies in short text notes so you can keep up a decent facade.   Sometimes they're so bad at bluffing that I start to feel like a conman myself. Even though my only aim is to waste all their time at airports holding placards and posing in a picture holding signs that say something like "IVANNA TINKLE" or "I LOVE MANBOOBS, INC" or something like that.   So far, of course, all of them want to meet me in Amsterdam, so I pretty much have no photos waiting to clog up my 1 gig Gmail inbox. Yet. Bastards.   Meanwhile, I've got to find some food around the house to go with the Coke. Bye.

      I can't watch it on TV, but I've listened to it on BBC Radio Five and it's just as good. The BBC people were talking animatedly in the last two minutes.   This is one of the most incredible games in the universe! And I never got to watch it live!  England had, what, all of two chances in the first half (and scored once) - not including the Beckham penalty which Coco the Clown saved (!). Two  Zidane  goals in  stoppage time ! Two Zidane dead balls!  No goals from open play. All the fancied forwards - you name it, he was pretty much anonymous. And all that Rooney kid did was two runs and a couple of passes. That's pie in the face for you Henry peeps.   People are going to wake up to SPH's Godfrey Robert's latest instalment of  urlLink populist bullshit  about how England deserved to win. Sorry, England was pretty much trounced in every department, and it's not just my opinion (see BBC  urlLink player ratings )... except the French forwards. Lacklustre.   Or, if the BBC isn't good enough for you, try ESPN Soccernet's  urlLink report , Godfrey.   I'd say they didn't deserve to lose. But if you say that they deserved to win, then that's a different thing, because you know how the English football never lives up to its billing.   Laterz.

But I still think it's bullshit.    urlLink Slashdot comment : "Thankfully, we'll probably all be dead before 'alot' becomes kosher in formal writing."   Sorry, dude, that is like, so totally freaking wrong.   Good news: today England are gonna have France pack their luggage for the long flight home.   Bad news: I don't have cable TV to watch it. And I don't have cable TV to watch NBC's Saturday Night Live, which Kenn was waxing too much lyrical about just now. Hot damn.   I  could  make the short trip to two blocks away where G is staying, but his mother is already sick and tired of his friends coming to "watch those stupid cartoons" - also known as the Simpsons, almost the greatest cultural parody on American primetime. We also watch Seinfeld, but she doesn't complain about our impeccable taste for Seinfeld's crisp comedy writing. Let alone come at 3am to watch Europeans stroke a ball around a park and 30,000 delirious people watching Zinédine "Zizou" Zidane make a mockery of that Beckham bloke. Poor, poor Beckham.   But I pity myself even more. And of course I can't go to CY's place, because what other agenda could you have for going to a girl's house in the dead of the night? Watching Les Bleus giving a footballing lesson to Les Anglais as a reason doesn't sit well with the parents of a girl, or so it's said.   So... screw this. I'll be at albinoblacksheep.com until 5am. Bye.

      France 0 Greece 1. Yes yes yes yes yes! I have recovered lost capital. Not a great night of football, really, Greece had very miskicked crosses and corners and few sparks of true footballing vision, but France in a word: uninspired. But give Greece credit: they deserved to win this.   And without Patrick Vieira - my favourite player aside from Davids and, of course, Zidane - what a difference that makes. And believe me, France were just plain sluggish because there was only Zidane left to push the team, and believe me again, Zidane hasn't got "pace" or "urgency" among his long list of footballing virtues.   Don't believe me? Guardian, on the French press conference after France's extra-time victory over England: "Befitting a man who plays football as if he has all the time in the world even in the most dramatic of circumstances, Zinedine Zidane fiddled with his watch yesterday as he reflected on Sunday night in Lisbon."  So yes, Zinedine Zidane was like a magician without his biggest prop: Patrick Vieira. Hornless in every front. Does Vieira make Zidane horny? That is the breakfast question of the day, folks.   And, unlike what any of our local "soccer" pundits would like you to believe, football has never been a game for forwards, unless you're talking about Brazil, where everybody is a potential forward. Until someone comes up with a decent theory about this footballing idolatry and why people wear jerseys with Thierry Henry's name on it, I'll be downing my breakfast like a guy who's just won $10. And I have, people, I have.   And perhaps it's just plain wrong to rave about a guy who once flashed his pubic hair at an interview... but I'll do it. But later.

      Yes! Portugal are through! However, I am five smackers down. I bet 1-1 and Portugal to win on penalties, but G bet 2-2 and Portugal to win on penalties. And although neither of us debated on whether the silver goals count, but it was decided that G wins by default.   Quite amazingly, Luiz Felipe Scolari has done it again. Or maybe  not  amazingly, because England, to put it this way, were only outcrapped by a dung shed. But the thing is, Portugal didn't lose despite throwing everything they had (and Luis Figo out of what was almost his last international match...).  So yes, justice is served a second time on a shiny silver platter, much helped because England have about as much steely nerves as an amoeba. But many kudos to Scolari, again, for beating a team of massive, underachieving egos into shape. And what wide smiles too, for a country with people who have been robbed of US$4 billion for Euro 2004 in the midst of a recession.   And the couldn't-give-a-tinker's-cuss, super deadpan look of the Eric Bischoff dead-ringer, Deco, as he took the spot-kick... priceless.   Great job, Portugal. But from here they meet either Sweden or Holland, and although I've been rooting for Portugal since Scolari's tenure began the future looks hazy for them. But I'm sure they won't give up without a fight.   Oh, and to cap up a day of served justice, the US Supreme Court has refused to order Dick Cheney to  urlLink reveal  the Bush administration's energy policies. Dick Cheney still receives yearly payouts from Halliburton, this world's greatest cheats since Enron bit the dust, and also *that* oil company that won many lucrative Iraqi reconstruction contracts uncontested.

      It's not exactly early now, but I'll type this hastily as my sister fries frankfurters in exchange for computer time till 7am (but I'll get to listen to the England-Portugal game on Five Live, and maybe later today I'll get to watch the tape at G's house). Sucks to be my sister, I know.   But my terms are quite generous, anyhow. Six hours of computer. Very good brother, me.  In other news, someone or someones (!) from a "convent school" put a comment on my blog which I accidentally deleted and there's no way of undo-ing the delete. Thanks for dropping by, anywho.   Scambait progress: uncertain.   I practised free-kicks today. My left foot is horrible. More on that when I have the time. Gotta run, bye.

      Scott Raymond  urlLink describes  a combination of two of my favourite technologies yet. See, it's not the most visionary thing ever, and yet nobody's doing it. Yet.   One of probably only ten Mac users in Singapore is  urlLink Mr Brown , who's got a column in Mediacorp's "free sheet" - the paper in general, not the column per se, sets a new mark for total mediocrity (note how Mediacorp and mediocrity share a lot of alphabets). And... apparently, not having the sharp end of the SCV MaxOnline stick. Because in the last two or three weeks it's stalled, let's see - about a million times, by my best estimates.   As a casual aside, there are pictures of girls in Mr Brown's blog. Go.   Oh, and one of my first 419 scambaits (that was replied to after the third e-mail, at least) is coming to a very, very exciting end, with the scumbug sending US$25 to an orphanage (but not a local one). Because nobody I asked (on a web forum) wants to help me here.    For the next one, should I return to the scambaiting fraternity after the hols, I plan to get a mugu arrested. At least, I want to get him to pose nekkiddddZzzZ. Holding a sign like  urlLink this , but in the buff.   I have to go now.

      The Observer  urlLink on  Luiz Felipe "Big Phil" Scolari, Portugal coach: "All of Portugal is watching the 56-year-old who again stares at failure on an epic scale. So far in his career, he has thrived on such occasions."  I'm not banking on Portugal to win, mind you - but I'd really like Portugal to win this one. If they don't, I'll blame the lack of breadth of talent, etc. (Which isn't quite true.) But if they do, you heard it here first, Big Phil has worked unlikely magic again. He has now booted Spain out of Euro, and it isn't as if they had a bad match against Portugal. Far from it.   England - oh wait, they can't string 10 passes between them. I guess that's why I'll be a mad, raving, drooling England fan at one of our local cinemas in the dead of the night. Like a plasticine screwdriver, goes an almost obvious but reeking of plain genius simile from a Guardian feature, Singaporean "soccer" fans aren't always the sharpest tools in the box.   I'm off for breakfast now. Good luck.

       urlLink Petals Around the Roses . After several tries I decided to read the background information - which is the biggest giveaway ever. And then I got it.   Unpleasant Event Schedule: Get four writers, from different pockets of the U.S. to commit to  urlLink composing a poem a day  during the year's shortest month.   Thurston Moore's poem forms all the lyrics to his song Peace Attack on Sonic Youth's latest LP - which is, as has been said, one in a long line of superb SY records, and nothing more.   Four of Brian Eno's earliest albums have been remastered, and here's a  urlLink four-in-one review  on Pitchfork and  urlLink Drowned in Sound . At this point there's little reason to harp on why Brian Eno is perhaps one of the finest musicians of his day - it's a given already.

      From the reactions at Five Live, this is brilliant, totally brilliant football - Holland versus Czechoslovakia. Amazing stuff. The Czechs have stolen the game! Davids smacks the post from 25 yds, Nedved smacks the bar from  35 yds , Seedorf comes close twice from 30 yds and the Czechs come from two goals down to overcome 10-men Holland 3-2! Not that the one less man actually makes a difference!  I hope they both go through, but that looks quite unlikely now. Poor, poor Holland. They lost because of a stupid manager who tinkered when they were so comfortable. Mr Advocaat, that was really bad.   I'll go watch the tape at G's house later and let you know what I think.

       urlLink gCount  is exactly what I need. Too bad it doesn't work now.   Chinese oral: It was quite horrible, actually. The good thing is that I've said more in this oral than all my other Chinese orals combined since Sec 1. At least, though, the discussion to my questions was relatively easy to marshall in Mandarin. But for each question I spent at least a minute or two looking at the blank space between myself and two bored-looking Chinese examiners. The cause was pretty much gone from the start, anyway, and it's as if I can do anything about it now.    Listening comprehension: I got different answers from everybody.   People - from SPH to whatever - have been moaning about the death of footballing justice. And here's where the whole philosophy about football sinks in, one which both Luiz Felipe Scolari  and  Otto Rehhagel understood a very long time ago: tactics, teamwork, determination and discipline. What I do not know is if attacking flair is a natural extension to these virtues, but I hope I'll have some divine answer on Monday. I might sound like a no-good ultra neutral, but as I said before the Portugal - Spain game, 1. Portugal will qualify for the knockout stages (and quite deservedly advanced after that); and 2. I'd like them to win it.  Or maybe it's because I lost $20 on 0-0 and Greece winning on penalties, which brings my total profit from football punditry to $-5.  I am also total kickass on Fifa 2004.   I am also very happy about the fact that while G and CY have their respective steadies to cuddle with on the hard seats in shopping centres while tucking cups of bubble tea under their armpits, I am waddling around in bed with my laptop, with a couple of cartons of Vitasoy on the floor, and generally living up to the label of "pig". Doesn't take a pig to be happy these days, though...

      Oral updates at a later date. Before I set off for our youth day celebrations, though, here's something:  For the past couple of months our class has been arranging a dunking station - which is a mainstay at all of those girls' school fairs (ours is today but closed to the public). The only thing that stood in the way was approval; then, the teacher in charge said it was not a viable operation and refused to release school funds for transport, etc etc.   Cue two months later: Yesterday they announced - to the very private disgust of those who had worked hard on it (that is, not me) - that they *were* going to have the station after all.   The best part of the deal is that they used the contacts that one of my classmates had gone so painstakingly to compile for the best deal. From bewildered faces I don't think they were even informed.   I mean, look, putting even a minimum effort into school activities is not in my blood. And again, it doesn't even matter in the first place *who* collects the money. But isn't that despicable.   (It's in coupons that you've *already* paid for as part of the school fees, and I doubt all the coupons will find homes in plasic bags, so what does one do with the surplus? Another jacuzzi?)  It doesn't justify any kind of school spirit or what. Not that the teachers sing the school song or anything - they'd have a better chance of singing the DPRK national anthem, and scoring a perfect game at bowling.   Plain sad - because the people who bother the most get buggered. All stolen: the project, the potential testimonial mentions, their almost disillusioned idea that our school is actually worth bothering about, etc and all that.   Well, that's quite typical from a professional. I don't know how their thought processes functioned shortly after the class' proposal was rejected, but the people involved could have done with an apology. That might be beyond professionals though.  Laterz. I've got to tend to my super arm-wrestling booth.  (PS In defence of the dunking booth, give 'em credit: for some obscure reason nobody else has ever had the courage to bring the idea up.)

      A very quick update about my life, best summed up in a word: hectic.   The bad   A new timetable is slightly more brutal than the old one (release at 2.40pm earliest every day, no rest periods)   Tests for every subject coming up next week  Chinese O Level orals tomorrow, listening on Saturday  Our school's closed-to-public youth day celebrations means that our class has a little stall - and I have been assigned to arm-wrestle people - what the?!  Joey and I have to type out essays "ASAP" - I think we're both on the shortlist for our school's typically crappy (if you ask me) essay collection, and I doubt I'll make the cut.    The good   Class t-shirt - cost $13 and isn't lousy, but isn't the best thing in the world I hope it's not too thick like my other shirts so I can wear it at home  I'll have a new set of pyjamas soon, if Kenn promises to buy for me - barring natural disaster, pyjamas delivery failure or intervention by miscellaneous forces I will be showcasing it in preference to the class t-shirt on Marist Youth Day  Expect to arm-wrestle a weak, short, drooling kid in his jammies - priceless  Famous-among-TKGS-girls-currently Kenn and me bought a couple of pies each for tomorrow morning's football game  Our class bet that the result of tomorrow's football game would breach nine goals - one buck per head. That's a bit stupid you say - payouts, as I've heard: $180 per dollar   Bah, bah. And it's Chinese oral tomorrow. And guess what? I'm in the first Express class to the oral - I'm among the first 40, at least. And I failed my Chinese oral in school, the only one in my level to do so, and our school's grading standards for oral is far more liberal than anything they're going to throw at us tomorrow.   I have a headache now. Bye.

      "All exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation." -  Bertrand Russell    urlLink Margaret Atwood : "The male brain, now that’s a different matter. Only a thin connection. Space over here, time over there, music and arithmetic in their own sealed compartments. The right brain doesn’t know what the left brain is doing. Good for aiming though, for hitting the target when you pull the trigger. What’s the target? Who’s the target? Who care’s [sic]? What matters is hitting it. That’s the male brain for you."  Russell and Atwood combine with some kind of weird time-transcending telepathy to explain why none of the most celebrated thinkers are female. Two possibilities about the truth, then: either it's too simple or Man has made absolutely no progress towards the truth at all, Einstein or no Einstein. Both of which seem perfectly valid.   Recently, though, some classmates have been particularly infatuated by Dan Brown - there was even a blurb about it on the Today free sheet, which means that Dan Brown is now the Britney Spears of book authors, because Today isn't BBC radio, where people and talk show hosts mingle and discuss indie music (in excess of 25% of music in the UK is indie), books and Tolstoy... sort of, for the last item.    Singapore radio talks about David Beckham and "soccer", and I swear once when I was having breakfast at McDonald's in the morning there were these two jokers on the radio insulting each other's favourite English football club. Why do Singaporeans need to have such completely worthless idols? Beckham is about as smart as a shoe.   I've not been too enchanted by fiction books lately. Don't ask why. I'm usually a junkie - I have a mindmap of Ulysses the size of my bed - but I've foolishly given it away.   Anyway, an update of my life: nothing whatsoever.   Nobody's called me in years, and I haven't called anyone in eons either. (I'd appreciate it if it stays this way, thanks.) E-mail correspondence has been minimal: a couple of messages to this guy who's sending me my US$25. And G's mom has banned me (and CY) from the house because we watch that pornographic show - she's talking about Monty Python's Flying Circus - there was, however, one episode just full of Carol Cleavage prancing around. And also Carol Cleavage changing, of course, and yes, boobs exposed. But it was fast-forwarded. And, I think it was a separate episode, though, one with Carol Cleavage in really revealing clothes talking in a male voice. (John Cleese's voice, as it is for most of the MP voiceovers.)  It didn't help that we watched one Black Adder episode where Blackadder is sleeping with a prostitute in his room. That one got G's mom really hopping mad - but considering that she watches those stupid Channel 8 dramas, she can't have any more taste than a yeti with its tongue cut off. Sorry, G, but it's the truth.

      To sum up my day, Brian Eno, St Elmo's Fire, hastily written bullshit Eno hit single: "Brown eyes and I was tired; we had walked and we had scambled; through the moors and through the briars; through the endless blue meanders."  Later he describes St Elmo's fire as "splitting ions in the ether", a line that was either so sublime or so utterly daft that nobody of note has bothered to crib it.  What's the worst thing that can happen to you when you can go 100 WPM, have a 400-word essay to type out, and it's the night before you've got to turn it back to your teacher?  That's right, it's happened. !@#!@#!@#!# Oh. I've found it again.   The essay I've got to type was the also the one which I've scored my best mark ever. But I don't really like it all that much. I was really squeezed for time, and I did the entire thing right in front of my English teacher, while half-listening into the lesson, talking rubbish with Kenn and company and so on. Which pressed me so much I just kept weaving lines and lines of totally senseless flowery expressions to fill up the lines. Don't tell me teacher I said that.   Turns out it was the best composition I'd ever done, I got the highest marks for an essay she'd marked in two years, and it was read out in class - surely too flattering for something that was invented only upon necessity. And bullshit, to include today's obligatory euphemism.  And worse: she thought I had been listening to too many of her motivational tidbits, which is best described as modern Aesop's fables, sans talking animals.   The truth was I'd (m)angled my story in such a way that the only way for me to redeem it was to end with something like "I had met kindness" and give it a conveniently cute title "Meeting Kindness", which were the last two words I wrote on that sheet of paper.   So it was all an accident, really. Kenn also had his much nicer story about swallows read out - lean and mean indeed, but mine gave new justice to the fact that you can bullshit your way through anything at all.   But we'll see.

      The  urlLink Nigeria Project . Speaks for itself.  Someone tell me this *isn't*  urlLink Hilton in Abuja  - Nigerian capital - overkill!  Pictures of the US$25 I'm about to get are  urlLink here , courtesy of a kind Brit on the scambaiting forums who's provided a maildrop on my behalf. Anyone with ideas on how to spend this money? It's not much, but again, there's not much fun in spending money you haven't earned.   Oh, right, I've also clean forgotten to type and print my essay (written hastily during teacher's lesson, heh - for some reason), which should make it right out of the selection process for essays published in next year's very uninspiring school essay compilation - or pinned up in some dusty, unnoticed corner in the school's very neglected open house. Come to think of it, it's almost like a bloody punishment.   And oh, oh, Physics level test - total crap. I literally squandered 15 mins by staring at the booklet because I was so confident I could finish it on time - the questions were actually easy by our school's incredible standards, but there were so many of them. Turns out I didn't even flip the stupid booklet to look at the questions, and with five minutes left I realised I hadn't done 5-6 pages. When time was up I still had 3 blank pages to stare at, one of which I scribbled on in utter desperation.    Mehh. I've done it before and done reasonably well. Actually, twice, but anyway, I've got to go now.

      Congratulations to SPH for yet another completely appalling instalment of the Sunday Times, replete with a very informative article like this one:   urlLink Singaporeans are class-concious.  DUHHHHHHH. Now quit wasting my time, losers, and pull out a decent publication already.   On to a more interesting topic: pornography.  Ron Jeremy, the world's #1 porn star. He has a Master's from Queen's College (the Oxford one?), and a couple of BAs. Some people have all the luck. Ron Jeremy is a Jew and half of his family have PhDs.  Hugh Hefner, the man every male wants to be (sans the wrinkles, etc). Hefner has - ahem - a hefty IQ of 152 and, in a way more profound than Ron Jeremy can manage, put such a spin to porn that makes it look legitimate again. (It *is* legitimate, in my opinion, in general, because all want to make $$$, but sometimes you've got to pander to your more conservative side.)  Read this Hugh Hefner  urlLink interview  though.   Quite amazing that some of the smartest people I've read about are turning the very large cogs in no small way of the porn biz. We have our own Annabel Chong, and while she is a woman of contradiction - if you read enough about her, she is undeniably smart and articulate.   There are also a couple of porn stars who've graduated from uni with first class honours, represented their countries in science and maths olympiads, and whatever. I didn't get to all of this by gatecrashing right through porn, obviously - the behind the scenes stuff is always much tamer.   Mark my words: one day somebody will write a spread about the smartest people in the world being porn stars, and it's not as if it isn't already - um - fucking obvious, to squeeze in the obligatory other use for the F-word as an intensifier.

      In one sharply written commentary, the Beeb  urlLink on why  the US has blown US$151bil to find things that don't exist: "US intelligence was willing to base their case for war, in some part, on some nervous, suspicious man from Amman." Just US$10bil - six point seven percent of that - will be able to fund the UN's quest to battle AIDS.  urlLink Saving Grace  is a wonderfully written Guardian feature. I spend all my time reading stuff like this, but this one is quite inspired.   On Slashdot today, Mac users are not just smarter than PC users, they also  urlLink have a better grasp of English . But that conclusion was reached by some guy using what are essentially mathematical calculations.   Slashdot idolatry of Macs and Mac users has escalated to a point I call Kim Jong-ilism: "The classic 'Mac user' is just an insanely cool bohemian dude who probably lives in a free wi-fi enabled coffee shop." Hahaha. Actually, there's a reason why it's called Kim Jong-ilism: it's mostly unfounded.   Me, I'm more average than the average Singaporean teenager, who has an IQ of about 2, listens to trashy music like Hoobastank and Avril Lavigne, wears bermudas, always roots for England at football, reads trashy local celeb magazines, has a Nokia handphone, and uses a Windows PC at home. It invariably falls to those two, because Singaporeans are daft, that's all.   Okay, I'm not, but I am more lifeless than the average Singaporean teenager. I'm a recluse - I never leave the house unless I have to. Another flaw is that I don't have the kind of brains it takes to spend S$3 on a ringtone that sounds more like a fart than a pop staple. (Although they have a lot of other similarities.)   Tangerine dream...

      (Seems that hax0r translates to "hacker" in English, because it's supposed to look like a "C" and "K", but I also do not see many similarities between "leet" and "genius".)  A very tame list of the  urlLink stupid things girls* do . (Girls = adolescent females; other types of girls are more worth your time.)  Oh, standard stuff. I have a quibble though.   What is inexplicably unexplainable is that after those few people compiled this list, more boys and girls come around to argue and, of course, mingle. What is even more unexplainable is the excessive usage of the words "like, hello?!", which is all the more ridiculous because we do not have a ridiculous American twang to go with it.   Or the word "guy", which is slang, and never mind that Nigerian 419 scammers refer to each other as "guymen", which would raise the average homophobe's eyebrow above the roof, and Singapore has got more homophobes than number of gas bubbles in a freshly opened can of Dr Pepper's.  I haven't read it all, and not since this "girl" decided to add her  urlLink refutal . Will you people find some better use for your time. Like watching pornography and fantasising about girls on the Net. Oh wait.   Here, though, is a short list of stupid things boys like to do. Generally applies to all males, but particularly to people from my school. (I like to distance myself from these people by not using the words "schoolmates", "buddies", "best friends" - which defeats the purpose of the superlative; and "brothers".)  1. Make amorous noises at the few young, female teachers in school, never mind voluptuous rating.   2. Urinate all over the toilet. I've never seen anybody in action before but I bet at least one joker goes fire hydrant all over the f***ing toilet.   3. They all look alike - they have the same bags and sneakers, and they all wear the same sick-looking bermudas at the mall. They justify that with "it looks nice WADDD", but honestly, never trust people who listen to Hoobastank and wear the same Nike shoes to school because it's "trendy".   4. Nobody is willing to splurge on teen magazines, but the moment one is spotted everybody crowds around it to read stories about girls with blue discharge, or worry that hairs on their armpits would fall into their cornflakes.   5. They like to appear crazy to girls. That is probably why all their Friendster testimonials read "dis guy ar.... crazie one... hahaxx". Although in school they don't spend five minutes without making a reference to the human anatomy, having sex with someone's parents (would you really), or being a general asshole.   6. They play the skin flute, skin the one-eyed trouser snake, greet John Thomas, sharpen the pork sword, and go blind. Some do it a lot and others do it occasionally, but everyone does it. And their moms don't like it... usually.    7. They'll play sport with you but it seems that their idea of sport is to completely deny everybody else of a fun afternoon.   Anyone to add to this list must note one thing: that it must describe people from my school only, because I hear other schools have better specimens of boys, and it's not as if some half-brain here couldn't do with a reminder of what he is - a weeping, self-hating loser who mutilates himself over the kitchen sink because so do those creepy, crazy American rockers.  Bye.

      My US$25 has arrived on my "humble desk". Anyone, anyone at all, please tell me where to get a money changer. I plan to take a bunch of photos of all my futile purchases, esp. the money changing bit, and then send it right back to the fucker's face.   Finally Real Madrid have taken their heads out of their asses and are trying to get Patrick Vieira - and if they do, Becks is out of a job. First they remove Claude Makelele and then installed Beckham in his place - what the...?!   Oh, and Marco van Basten to take over the reins of the Netherlands' football team. Did you people do well with Rijkaard? No. But he had a brill season with Barcelona, and not even with Ronaldinho - it took van Bronky and Edgar Shortie to elevate them to championship material. But now Davids is gone, and that brill-but-misfiring-by-rapid-twists Deco has big boots to fill.   Slate has a great  urlLink article  on tired.com.  If I ever send an e-mail to tired@tired.com, here's what it'd read: I'm not tired, I just need more time to sleep.   sunnytzu on Slashdot: "Insomniacs don't  urlLink type "tired" into their web browser , they just stay up all night trying to go to sleep."   Mine is not so bad that I have to take pills to get to sleep, but I definitely understand the plight. Ugh.

      For some reason I've received an e-mail from my DM saying he's out of the country on official duty and will respond to my e-mail in due time. The good question: So what does Mr DM's absence/disappearance got to do with me? The better question: How come he's got my e-mail address? Even better: How come I sent him an e-mail?  The better explanation is that somebody has mass-emailed dumb kids and changed the reply-to headers. Ha, prankster.   Oh, it seems that our school is so upset over us watching Copa America in our classes during recess that they've locked us out of our classes during this time.   Well, Mr-and-Miss-School-People: it's not as if the teevee serves any other purpose. It's only on for all of twenty minutes before morning assembly, and immediately after that, just during the 10 spare minutes before lessons start and said student finally has spare time to take a look, they switch the stupid things off. Some TV.   Such smart purchasing decisions on the part of the people who run this trainwreck of a school also extends to opening iMac labs that just sit there the entire year unused until the stupid school open house, where they gloat about our school's dazzling array of computer technology - and promise you a lot of action on these cute, iFruity, gumdrop-esque pieces of technology.    Crap school. People, aunties, uncles, never put your kid in this school. They even promised a swimming pool but looks like a hole in the ground is too much of an expense. The toilet smells like a zoo enclosure. Far from it being the fault of the janitors, though: most of the highly intelligent lifeforms in the building have decided to focus their energies - and their warm jets - to showing their more flamboyantly zoologistic tendencies in the most convenient place in the world. (I have no idea what this means.)  Early eulogy on Kenneth's  urlLink new blog  (welcome to the blogosphere): "He was dragged away forcefully into the light."   Which brings to mind the grand finale of the Blackadder series when Captain Blackadder and crew walk out of their trenches into just that - the light. (Haven't watched it yet, but that's what I've heard.) No man's land - is that what you call the space between warring trenches?  It turns out that just about everyone failed the Physics level test, so my break in the middle of the test - just beause I could (that's the way people work in my school) - wasn't in vain.   Anyway, back to homework. And after that, maybe I'll have a hot mug of cocoa.

      I'm le tired now.   Oh, oh, and Biology LT on Wednesday. Bah.   The  urlLink "fuck-off"  salute by bungling Halliburton pensioner cum US vice president Dick Cheney makes this  urlLink Slate columnist muse  about the only two British contributions that will ever be remembered: the expression "fuck off" and the game of football.

        "If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to."  - Dorothy Parker  Sleep sleep sleep. Oh - and am I late or what - happy birthday Charmaine. I really did try to remind myself to write a greeting on my blog but I have been busy doing nothing recently. And anyway it isn't as if my greeting is that important. Not any more than yet another day to ensure Hallmark's financial sustenance.  And oh -- I am officially in love with Dorothy Parker:  "Brevity is the soul of lingerie."  "I require only three things of a man. He must be handsome, ruthless and stupid."  "I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true."  And besides, she looks kinda cute.

      I'm having some "PREMIUM DARK SWEET CHERRIES", which is 25% plain opinion, 25% fact, 25% untrue, 25% generally correct observation, and all awful. Sweet? Hardly.   The highlight for our school's celebration of racial harmony was  not  to change their policy to allow non-Chinese students to study here. Instead we read some crappy religious harmony pledge.   Yes, it is quite painfully obvious that if one learns to live with others peacefully there would be no infighting, but some person or persons unknown are seriously underestimating our IQs.  Wait - if that's the case, how come we need reminders to be polite to each other and to speak Mandarin?   Well, that's because, like Harry Lee Kuan Yew once said, "pay peanuts and you get monkeys". Which is why you ought to spend some money on futile campaigns to get something arguably better than monkeys. I'm not so against Singapore as to classify Singaporeans under "monkey", but they're quite simian in my humble opinion. Queueing up at McDonald's to get cute toys of kitties - only monkeys could have done that.    "I'd like an hour on the holodeck with Seven of Nine."  - Comic Book Guy (IQ 170; has a PhD) with a typically fantastic retort to Homer's request for Spiderman Issue #1, but Homer has the last laugh by eating the mortally superior comic - this has Comic Book Guy rolling on the floor and crying. The Simpsons.   Sony and BMG have merged - thank goodness for that. I'd love to start saying that you shouldn't buy artist(e)s from any of the Big Five - now Big Four - company, but let's face it, some people exist on this earth to be financially exploited. Others exist to exploit.   And yes, this is today's attempt to be crudely cynical. I know I was eating cherries at the start of this entry, but I'm digging into a really nice pie now and I know none of you give a damn and not only will I not thank you for reading so far I will laugh at you for doing so while munching on succulent pepper-infested beef and pastry and you know my throat is steady and I won't choke.  Yet.

      Currently spinning: Angie Stone, Franz Ferdinand, Tangerine Dream, Sigur Ros, Deerhoof, Sufjan Stevens, George Harrison, John Lennon, Thievery Corporation. And Dr Dre. (I also listen to too much Talking Heads, and I'm not just talking about Byrne and co.)   Not much to report on the personal side. Except that do you know why it always rains on Thursday? It has for the third week in a row, and it's dry on other days. Well, Thursday is PE lesson day, and I'm in this module called Fitness & Conditioning where they make you walk around the school once...   Oh, not that I'm fat, but CBG is to me the new cool. Fat, ugly, unwanted, eats too much, and his only friends are Superfriends. Woohoo.   My classmate Yen Theng is out of this pathetic country and on his way to Massachusetts. Good luck on your magical mystery tour, dude. You'll likely find true love, better schoolmates, and a world hopefully not run by Bush - and the richest government administration in US history.    "Well on the way, head in a cloud, the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud. But nobody ever hears him; or the sound he appears to make; and he never seems to notice. But the fool on the hill, sees the sun going down; and the eyes in his head see the world spinning around."  - Fool on the Hill, the Beatles  Have to go study something now. Bye.

      English oral - really bad. My grade paper (comments, but no marks written on it) was scrawled on from corner to corner. And my English teacher is strict.   And what did she say? "In case you were thinking, it's not all bad..." Oh dear. Double-negative. At least, though, according to Kenn - the teacher told him that she told me similar remarks - and for last year's oral he was given due praise for, if I remember right, "business-like articulation". So hopefully if I fail I won't be the only one making cheap McDonald's napkins all soggy and crumpled.  I got my 419 scammer lad to sign a  urlLink cute little form that I invented . The slightly quirky phrasing is the lovechild of really sleepy brain cells, and unedited regurgitation of some of CY's ideas - some things run in the mind of girls that I don't ever want to understand.   Like pandas copulating - I do not want to have a 500-word e-mail speculating whether pandas copulate missionary, doggy, or as  urlLink Washingtonienne  (a US state government intern who got fired for screwing everybody within reach, and then using gov't computers to write about it) says in a Wonkette* interview, "Tulsa wheelbarrow".   *Wonkette appears to be, as most political blogs on the Internet are, moderate-extreme-left, and not a blog about 1. the adventures of a crazy girl; and 2. a girl with a phallus - she'd call it Wankette.  It might be of interest that this form is not the end at all. This is merely the  start  of a shitload of totally irrelevant forms addressed to authorities that do not exist. Sorry sir, I apologise in advance that the US$15 000 I promised you will never reach its destination.

      Aye. An update on my studies: I can actually visualise what I want to write during the average Elective Geography class test now.   Oh, and teacher-pupil conference - or the best thing the WITS team in school has come up with in years - is really 10 of us sitting in a classroom answering questions as startlingly ungeneric as "What is your opinion of having a boy-girl relationship at the age of 16?" and "What could you have done for the school".   There's an organic chemistry test tomorrow - and my English oral. You know how I love looking at pictures of pus-addled teenagers frolicking in the sun and racking my brains choosing one of the three possible interpretations. (New syllabus means that you cannot mindlessly ramble about checkered shirts, nice abs or girls in ponytails - grrrr. When you're in a bus the ponytails go swing swing swing swoop - irritatin'.)   Outside of school - ugh, lonely. Verily. I have almost nothing to live for these days. Except my favourite porridge stall, Portuguese egg tarts, a couple of books I haven't gotten around to reading. I try to wake up smiling. I really try, though, and it's mostly successful.   I'm round the bend... bye.

      Yen Theng's last day of school before he goes to Massachusetts - bye. We bought him a chocolate cake.   And I stole a Durex condom. Condoms are infinitely useful currency in Teen World - I swapped the one I got for two bottles of Coke from a person who has expressed the desire to remain anonymous. The other use for a condom is...  urlLink this .   Apparently our school is second for basketball in the North Zone thing. Never mind that. For the NZ finals I think at least half the stupid school went to cheer our basketballers - no, I don't believe it myself.   Right.   Where were they when the school's basketball team sucked 'nads? Booing our own basketball team and fighting amongst ourselves and making fools out of ourselves, which is why we got banned by the school from attending our own school basketball matches... until two days ago.   As far as I'm concerned, school basketballers: you've earned your glory, it's yours, the coach's and the ten other people in your team, and don't let anybody - your beloved schoolmates & teachers, especially - ever take that away from you.   I have to go do some Chemistry now. Bye.

      Startlingly poor English in the entry yesterday - well, I actually bothered to proof it and rewrote a quarter of it hastily, drowsy and all. G - eat my shorts, but not the pair I'm wearing.   We have Mass tomorrow from nine to ten. Oh dear. I don't know why they force us to attend Mass.   I also have a fairly decent grade for the only SS assignment I've been made to do since this time last year, I believe. Considering I spent about 15 minutes tops on it, and that our school's markers are just plain sadistic.   I also have a whole set of this ex-student's Geography notes. He scored 7 points for his O Levels last year - straight A1s except Higher Chinese and English.  Let's go through his test results: his class tests average a bare pass mark, which is considered pretty good already.  And he failed his first Sec 4 preliminary examinations for Elective Geography.  And  in an act of almost total bizarreness the first sentence of his Sec 3 year-end examination answer script reads "The map has basically no contour lines".  And  I heard that they moderated the Combined Humanities result by ten juicy marks for last year's preliminary examinations, and even that wasn't going to prevent MOE from mailing their yearly letter about our prelim standards.   So there's still some hope left for the rest of us who've never passed an Elective Geography test ever. Ah, sorry to mock you in my humble little blog, dear seven pointer, but...   Um, nothing. Umlaut. Have to eat something now. Bye.

      12.5/15 for my Geography class test, which I like the sound of, since with 1 minute left I was barely a quarter of the way through the last question. Go me. Kenn and I got crappy tasting lollies courtesy of the Geography teacher who hates me (and still remembers my name from Sec 1) - I was quite happy to leave it outside my mouth when my English teacher singled us out for breaking school rules.   And we did the English discursive essay on external influences while she was teaching the lesson, which Kenn approached with a timeline, and which I didn't handle well so we went on a tangent. And with a minute to the end of the lesson and with half-marshalled arguments left unshelled, I ended by saying "burning fags isn't for heresy any longer. Isn't Western culture great?" - thereby breaking an unsaid rule for formal English. Twice.   This after we mangled Joseph's fantasy story into a one man show where the protagonist eats refrigerator doors and becoming the Lord of the Rings for no apparent reason at all.   Now spinning: a Kenji Williams live show. KW is the artist behind one of the standout tracks John Digweed's typically excellent compilations Bedrock... I think it's called Illusion or something. It's actually classic (violin) + house, which makes for smooth grooves.  I'm actually going to buy a couple of his CDs. The problem is which one. Funny how the best IDM and house albums and tracks have crappy names like "Illusion", "Faces of Epiphany", and the almost inconceivable "Moment Utopia".   The same problem affects jazz - Miles Davis named one of the most brilliant albums ever - never mind just for jazz. Beautiful cover, great songs, even the artist name sounds about right to grace Rolling Stones' "Best Ever" issue. And he had to ruin it by calling it Bitches Brew.   Right... yarrrrr.

      It appears that our dear millionaire Alice is emceeing a school humanities quiz, and that rich people have the "incessant desire to own [luxuries]". Why, yes, that must be the most insightful thing that required mention this year.   That said, it's quite pointless splurging excessively on something nobody will see you in, like a singlet. In which case I'd actually buy one with thinner material - a cheaper one, that is - it's comfortable.   Oh, oh, and apparently Malcolm (not the one from my EL class, but the one Maya christened on one of his bad hair days - which is every day) was the joker who kept yelling a vast array of all 3  vulgarities he knows during our school concert at some place, just to impress various members of the public into complaining. Hey, it isn't your concert, nobody asked you to come. It's not as if we have some kind of favourable impression to uphold.   Recently spotted: a completed essay on virtues your future spouse must have. The most important on that list: virginity. Koff koff koff.   Okay, right. Back to studies. Really.

      On the I-caught-a-bug front: I was taking a shower when I noticed that there was a (dead) beetle caught between the folds of my towel. How it got stuck there, how it died there, how come it didn't fall off onto the bathroom floor - I don't know.   On the football front: Been working on left-foot crosses and free kicks. So far my progress is okay - it's got the right swerve at least. But my approach angle for the left foot is a bit tight, so I've got to work on the power bit. Low shots: shabby for both feet. And I cannot dribble still, but that isn't such a great footballing virtue in my favoured position.   On the academic front: Let's just say it's generally crappy. But I've just started trying to make sense of my maths, at least. And biology. Boy do I suck at both. Of course they're both subjects you must mug for, and I haven't mugged them at all. But my tutor has a tantalising offer that she will keep secret from Mother, which involves some kind of generous monetary compensation for my hard work, so I might actually get cracking.   On the girls front: ______.   On the Simpsons-front: We had a Simpsons TV party at G's house since his Mother cooled a bit from the time we flashed Carol Cleveland's boobs at her. Four hours and 8 episodes. All of them slightly better than average. And in between, lots of weird tasting (but refreshing) beverages.   My to-do list:     Scan the new Friendster pic Kenn has made for me - or rather, I just kidnapped the damn thing Get someone to respect me for once  Get a recipe for a great Nigerian dish... I'll force one of my 419 scammer pets to find it. Heard it's a Lagos favourite, so shouldn't be too hard to get  Finish my English argumentative essay  Finish my Physics workbook exercise and Physics whatever  Get some stationery - oh wait it's eight and I better get cracking   So that's it from me.

      Now playing: Neu!; the Beatles; Christian Fennesz; John Digweed & Sasha; John Coltrane; Sigur Rós  Somebody got a public caning this morning - for stealing food. At the top floor and as the class closest to the quadrangle you can't see anything at all, of course - not even the cane. But the guy didn't flinch at all.   I have no sympathy for the canteen vendors because they cheat us of our money, only to dramatically reduce that amount when our principal shows up. Which isn't very often because he's always in China looking for "scholars".   I saw what used to be the little red-haired girl today with her boyfriend, eyes lost in each other and walking around hand-in-hand, round and round like a merry-go-round for human beings. (I saw them sharing an enormous bowl of chendol before my usual soy-milk binging, and they were frolicking at the bus-stop I wait at to go home.) Oh dear me.   No, she isn't red-haired. And yes, Peanuts-insiders might understand. And yes, her hair is no longer that shade. That was over a fairly long time ago.  Before Mongols came the people in my town had blue eyes and blond hair, now we mostly have dark haired people with hazel eyes and I am one of them and I don't mind being a brunette.  - Elena, on Mongolian invasion, massacre & rape

      For English lesson we had letter writing. I swear it wasn't my idea to write a crappy letter - I had half a mind to actually do it properly - but I wasn't the one wielding the foolscap and pen.  In any case, Kenn and I ended up writing a letter to a "good friend" and promoting four different places to stay in, including completely unnecessary promotional slogans, of which one reads "How about a small, dilapidated coffee [shophouse] house?"   I'd make an excellent friend if there ever was such a thing. Back to work - I have Chemistry November 2002 and the 1986 English Paper 2 to start on. It's not part of my study routine, mind you, because I totally despise the TYSes, it's homework.

      This is an entry in three parts. Okay, five, what the hell.   Zero Seven  I'm listening to Zero 7's Simple Things - a friend you despise but always appears when you need one.   A BBC review takes a Douglas Adams turn for their Simple Things review: "Soul food from the lounge room at the end of the universe."   Pitchfork's review is more acid than that.    urlLink Sia Furler  and  urlLink Sophie Barker  are only two of Zero 7's 15-strong live performers. Sia is better endowed than I'd imagined and Sophie reminds me a little of Nina Persson, and I really do mean "a little".    Oscar Wilde  Oscar Wilde was a wild, insane man who knew his similes and wrote books that swaggered from "crappy" to "sharp". The Picture of Dorian Gray is  urlLink good reading . Actually, a finely crafted short novel: I finished 60/230 pages in an hour, and reading on a computer screen is drastically slower than reading on paper.    Fuck you, morally superior people  I'm not chipper now... gotta learn to harden up. That's what life is about, right? Tell me - I'm a real man - a real, dignified man - when I'm a bucktoothed, impotent pensioner in a dirty creased burgundy polo t-shirt who has nothing to do but sit at a  kopi tiam  every time there's a stupid football match on and jeer really loudly as and when I like and smoke like a Javanese forest because this world belongs to me and I'm really high up on the class ladder, which is why I'm a bucktoothed impotent pensioner in a dirty creased...  Tell me... well, you've heard the parent slogan "you don't know what it's like in the working world". I go to school with the same people as I will work with in the future, so what gives? Dramatic changes in personality?    To the evangelist  I've removed this section because, honestly, I'm not hardline anything. I'm not an extreme atheist. I'm not a theist. I'm more convinced that I'll never know, that by believing in something I deem myself to have the final word. That's a bit too much arrogance in my book. But you never know, I'm still young. Some time in my twilight I'll probably convert to the religion that saves me from the jaws of death.    CY on opinion  I don't think in terms of the general opinion, because I despise the general person.
