      Heheheheheehehe    I AM....              You are 10% evil!    urlLink [How EVIIIIL are  you ?]      That's right!  You're the meekest of the meek!  You're the least amount evil!  The philosophy in ying and yang is that no one person can be completely good or completely evil, but you're pretty close to complete, goodie-two-shoes!

        What does everyone think of the new "Shpiel of the Week" column at the side?   Basically it's where I use a keyword, and spin a paragraph around it.  I got the idea from my friend  urlLink Jeff Yen  who picks a random word from a dictionary and writes a journal entry on it. I was his "guest" entry for this particular word,Threat, which I've used as a starting point for my weekly shpiel.  What do you guys think?   Drop me a flooble yah?

          Doli Incapax   and the 50-egg cake   I was at my friend  urlLink Joy's Blog   the other day, and read something interesting, called  doli incapax .  Basically it means that kids under the legal age of responsibility can't be held accountable for wrongful actions/ crime that they commit 'coz they can't yet tell right from wrong, and may not understand what they're doing.  Just what is the "legal age of responsibility"? Hmm...maybe the argument can be used for certain *ahem* 22 year-olds?  I'd love to plead that case. Especially for me, the  bumbly butter-fingered buffoon .  Well, it was Shawn's 24th B'day party today, though his b'day's tomorrow (that's the surprise!), and I kept doing bumbly things. Like dropping Joy's camera (classic 3 stooges stuff), biting into my plastic fork, and worst, accidentally hitting E-Gene's still-recovering-from-ligament-operation knee. ARGF. After  I was so careful not to. (He was in pain - you should've seen his face.) Oh and did I forget to mention that I left the sandwich maker on and it burnt through it's own rubber insulated wiring? How one day can go so wrong I don't know...sigh...  And it's not just today. It's EVERYDAY. I'm constantly making a fool of myself, either putting my foot in my mouth or causing/being involved in accidents. Charles says I should just try to be more aware, but as you can see from the knee hitting incident, it makes no difference. I'm just bumbly lil' ol' me. Ah wells.....    Enough of my whinging and whining...   Shawn's party was pretty great, organised by his girlfriend Joy. We stuffed ourselves silly with party food like egg sandwiches, pasta and nachos. BURRRRP. And of course, later, the DENSEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER. It must have had 50 over eggs in it (I'm extrapolating that figure after considering the fact that a block of Peranakan kueh lapis has 30 eggs in it. I'm not kidding.) ACK...feeling the pain now...  I think the highlight of the party has to be the "What do I hate/love about Shawn part" where everyone got to air their grievances. For more information, check out  urlLink his Blog  . Let's just say we had a ball of a time...hee hee hee...  Whatever it is, we all had a great time. Too bad Shawn did all the cooking and cleaning up after. :-) Now THAT'S what I call a good party, when the birthday boy prepares his own surprise birthday celebration. (No lah, he's not that pathetic...he was only let in on it 'coz there was no way to get him out of the way. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em! doodeedoodeedoo... His pasta was pretty good though.)     Bit of a borin' ol' read innit?     All rights, that's all for today. Sorry it's a bit of a boring read so far, only 'coz I'm too busy/lazy to write with my usual *ahem* creative flair. Tune in after I finish me essays for a more updated look to this site, and hopefully I'll be able to add more interesting links n stuff.

      Oh man  Just checked out  urlLink  my sis' Blog  . Man that girl is crazy. Anyways, thing is, i followed the link to the "Which Ep. 2 character are you?" website and found out my true calling is to be...bam bam bam bam....    urlLink    which Episode II character are you?      "Anakin Skywalker - jedi apprentice. Like Anakin, you know your morals and usually always stick to the rules. However, stray away from those who know best and you may become naiive to what anybody tells you. Stay with those whom you trust and have always been your friends. Otherwise, you may find yourself being manipulated by outside parties."    Darnnit - i really wanted to be Obi-Wan Kenobi! ah wells...  Anyways, do me a favour and take the quiz then let me know which character you are! (In the flooble msg box at the side...)

        Big Event    E-Gene had his knee operation today, to fix his torn ligament (soccer soccer soccer...the bane of all knees...)  Went with him in the morning, and checked into St Vincent's Private. Not bad - the room is pretty retro - the wallpaper, floor, TV etc. He has his own room and bathroom, so it's cool. The meals are pretty good - I know 'coz i ate his! (MMMM....yummy satay beef skewers on jasmine rice with peanut sauce, caesar salad, bread roll with butter, fruit salad, fizzy lemonade and clear consomme.) He wasn't allowed to eat anything coz of the anesthesia. He could have had something to eat in the morning, but coz we thought the Op was at 11 or 12, the time he checked in, so he didn't have anything to eat. In the end the Op was actually scheduled for 4pm.  Anyways, in the afternoon I left for the Apple store, came back but missed "seeing him off" to the operating theatre. It was about 5pm, so I hung out at a cafe for the next couple hours, then went to wait in his room and watched TV there. He came back about 8.15-8.20 pm.   He came back looking woozy and tired - he was under General Anesthesia after all. He's now on a morphine drip 'coz he's allergic to other painkillers - and it's self-administered. Hmm...wonder if anyone ends up euthanising themselves by accident...  Anyways, thank God the operation went well. He seems fine, and will probably be out on Friday or Saturday. Check back for more details on this page!     Just a quick update on my iBook situation.    Yesterday I ran a check using Disk Doctor. It was pretty cool 'coz i used it via Wally's Disk Doctor, installed on his Powerbook, through FireWire. I couldn't start up the Disk Doc using the CD so had to use my iBook as FireWire disk, and scan my HD on Wally's Powerbook.  It was so cool! We connected the FireWire cable, pressed T as my iBook started up, and voila! My iBook's contents appeared on Wally's desktop! Woohoo Macs rule!  Anyways, went to the other Apple Centre today. The IT guy there was really nice. I explained what happened, and mention the *ahem* small knock it had.  Told him my dilemma of warranty running out, as well as the countless assignments due. He said no prob, he'll register my problem, so when I go see him again (when I can in a few weeks time after essays are done), the warranty would still cover it. Excellent! So now I have time to do my assignments, and also try reinstalling Word for OS X again to see if that could fix the problem.   (Am doing work on Word for OS 9 right now btw. For non-Maccers, with the new platform, my iBook has 2 operating systems - OS X and OS 9.2. Programmes on OS 9.2 can start up in OS X via Classic mode, which is what I'm doing now with Word. Capeesh?)  The IT guy was pretty cool. He's like one of those "dude" IT guys lah - streaked blonde hair etc. And he kept saying "no dramas" meaning "no problem". So now it's Charles' (who was also there to collect his new OS X software) and my catchphrase - No Dramas! haha...  Oh yes. Got a poster as well from the place. Pretty nice. It's the iMac - but the old one lah, not the new one. Am planning to pop by other Apple stores to see if they have other posters that are just stocking up...

      It hasn't been a good day.  Firstly, I went to the Apple Store in town and they tell me the problem is probably the software, and the warranty doesn't cover software, only hardware. Then they tell me if I want them to check it out, it'll cost a $90 diagnostic fee, and then they'll give me a quote if I wanna repair the software. If it is a hardware problem, then it's covered under warranty. The whole process will take 3-4 days (or did she say it'll be 3-4 days b4 they get a LOOK at it? Which means it'll take at least 10 days altogether!)  I don't have Norton Utilities or Disk Doctor either. It could very well be a software problem that can be fixed by reinstalling my MS Word for OS X, or even reinstalling OS X itself. But i don't have the MS Office CD right now - it's with a friend.  Thing is, my warranty runs out in 6 days. So if i wanna get it fixed, i gotta do it quick. But i don't have the time to send it in 'coz i really need to finish researching and writing my essays! ARGH.  Basically I just want it done in the quickest way, less stress, NO $$$ spent. Everything costs so much in Australia!!  I'm gonna try another Apple Store near my place tomorrow, and see what they say. I'll call ahead though, and ask how much they charge for diagnostic fees etc. (The place i went to today didn't even take a look at my Mac!)   I think it's horribly unfair that they charge to tell you what's wrong with it. I can understand charging to fix the problem, but not for taking a look at it! Previously they had fixed a problem I had with the iBook on the spot (it wouldn't start up). Today they weren't even helpful! I don't get it.  Sigh...why don't I ever learn?

          AAARRRGGGHHHHHHHHGGGGHHHHHH        I dropped my iBook. My precious precious iBook. On the ground. From a chair. I knocked it over. By accident. Honest.    Ack! Now my Microsoft Word application won't open, and certain folders in the Finder can't be opened either.    And I have 3 MAJOR essays due soon.    HELP!! I'm almost in tears. This is terrible. And I really wanted to finish an essay by today so I could start on the rest. But I guess it's not meant to be. The scary thing is, I think I may have to send it into the Apple Store and get it fixed, and they might wanna change the hard drive or something. Which means I'll have to backup all my applications etc. and I don't have a CD writer or anything (although I could back it up on iDisk on the Apple servers, but that'll take too long on my 56k modem). I think hopefully my *AHEM* good buddy Charles (nudge nudge) might lend me his external CD-writer so I can back up my stuff.       WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN NOW??      I'm sure there must be a reason for all this to happen, some sort of Big Master Plan or something.  Either that or I should just be less  lun-zun .   Personally, I think it's the latter. Not that I don't believe in a BMP, just that I'm always  lun-zun  ;-)  Charles and E-Gene tell me that all the time. Like how if I could just be more aware, and watch what I'm doing I could avoid lotsa accidents.   But the point is, it's not like I'm not trying or anything. When you're unconsciously unaware, you just ARE. It's not like you can really help it.   Or Can You??    I don't know. I really don't know.   As a famous man once said,      So Help Me God!!

Crazy isn't it. Picking up bits n pieces along the way. But I'm still pretty new at it. That's why it's an obsession now, to tweak my Blog. ARGH...

      I'm supposed to be doing my essay now but am obsessed with fiddling with my Blog's appearance. Picking up a lil' HTML along the way - never done so b4. Am not a techie.  The only prob is i can't seem to change the colours on the side bar for shawn, e-gene and bart's links to orange like charles' n tessa's. And i can't seem to see the "flooble chatterbox" (a forum thingy) anywhere on the page - i think coz i use a mac and haven't updated my javascript capability or something...  I'd also like to enable a comments link to my posts. Anyone has any idea how to do so?  Btw, g0ldfi5h.blogspot.com is no longer in use - although the page still exists lah - the archives. It's herefishyfishy now. Although the ones i wanted, like goldfish.blogspot or fishbowl.blogspot were already taken. Darnnit

       urlLink    Went to the Hoyts Cinemas website and saw a contest they had for Spiderman - winner gets an original signed poster. So i entered the contest - the question was "If you could be a super hero, what kind would you be and why?"  I wrote:      I wanna be  Super-Essay-Girl  ! To save the world of Uni Students from the drudgery of writing essays on post-modernism and psychoanalytic theory! With my acto-plasmo eyeglasses I'd scan all textbooks and regurgitate information into 16-pg Times font size 12 scripts!      Cool huh? Hehe wish she'd really exist so she'd handle my essays for me haha...

      All rites...  Well then, things are starting to heat up for me now..lotsa essays and stuff. Feeling the pressure a bit..sigh. Not sure what to do. Plus i have to struggle with the various assignments, and i keep procrastinating.   I think that's (one of) my biggest faults...  Anyways, am eating butter and sugar on bread right now - the poor man's brekky hehe. But it really doesn't taste fantastic on sourdough bread. My advice is, stick to plain ol' white 'lo-ti'.  I got my radio assignment back today. Had overslept and missed class this morning - the second time this week! I was royally pissed that it happened - really wanted to make the class and discuss/workshop my ideas with people 'coz i was  feeling a little lost. Was so upset. Ack. Anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment, which i did pretty ok in.  My good buddy Charles got his back too - and i'm pretty upset on his behalf. I read his piece a little before he handed it in, and i really don't think it deserved a P. At the very very least an H3 (the grading system in Melbourne Uni is H1, then H2A, H2B, H3, Pass, Fail). And according to him she sorta 'dissed' his idea for the feature story too.  He wanted to write on Palms - or rather Personal Digital Assistants. Can you believe that she hasn't heard of them? Then again, I'm not surprised...apparently Australia is about 5 years behind in the whole PDA world - like their AUSPUG (Australian Palm Users Group) was just set up recently (as compared to the thriving one in S'pore and the States which have been around for ages). Geez Louiz...  Oh wells, so much for that. He's gonna try to reangle his story, and pitch it again. Hope she takes the bait!  As for me, I'm planning to do my topic on Naturopathy. Like natural healing and all. But i think the story's been done before, so I'm trying to take a fresh approach. I thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc., but i realise that it's too narrow for a 2500-wd piece. The most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds? And that's the max. So what to do then? (Any ideas, please let me know). I'll prob. see her again on Monday to discuss.  All ritey then. I'm gonna sleep now. Even though i don't really feel sleepy - slept from about 6-10pm just now! eeks..screwing up my whole system. But I'm supposed to wake up early and go for Brekky at this place called Fruits of Passion. It's got really good brekky, but a lil' expensive. Ah wells...pancakes yay!  Nitey nite! TTFN (Ta Ta For Now!)

        Bras 'n Things    Woohoo...went shopping again today. Myers is having a sale, today and tomorrow only, so i ended spending $88 on lingerie!! But i bought like 7 items, so that was pretty worth it (usually 80 bucks only gets you about 2 bras and 1 underwear...).  So yes, am pretty happy. Going crazy shopping i know. I spent 2 hrs there, SOLELY in the lingerie section, while poor Charles had to wander around the department store alone...poor guy.  But all this spending really means i have to get down n search for a job. Eeeks..praying for a good and fun one.  Anyways, we had a nice night after all that shopping...came back to Homebush (my old apt. where Wally, E-Gene and Shawn still reside) and cooked dinner, then had our Monday TV night. Yay, nothing like good food and good company (friends and the telly heehee).  Tomorrow my friend Joanne's supposed to arrive from Canberra for a visit. That should be fun! I'm also supposed to watch "I am Sam" tomorrow as well, can't wait.  By the way, everyone's vacating Homebush on July 7. Wally's moving to stay with a church friend, Shawn's moving to Jon's place (and therefore becoming my neighbour!), while E-Gene may or may not be returning to S'pore for good. I feel sad..it's like an end of an era or something. Had good times here, plus both Michelle's and Kenneth's places are in North Melbourne. Sigh...Wells, we're having a going away party on Thursday, have the whole gang over to bid this place a fond farewell.   Getting late, better sleep now.  Nites

        It's been awhile...    Yep, i'm back to blogging again...it's been quiet, mostly 'coz i've been tied up with assignments n essays n stuff. But it's the hols now, at least till 29 July!  Been having fun since stuff ended on the 14th. Went skiing at Mt. Buller with E-Gene's family, and that was really fun. His whole family was there, including his sis and bro-in-law and nephew. Boy, the baby's cute! His name's Ethan, and if i knew how to upload a pic onto my blog i would, but sadly...need to find erm, some server or something b4 i can upload pics right? (Hmm... i think i can put it up on my mac site...will check that out.)  Anyways, skiing was really fun, had a ball of a time just tumbling down the slopes hehe....would have loved to ski more, or at least try a longer distance, but it wouldn't have been much fun without E-Gene around...he couldn't ski 'coz he didn't want to risk injuring his knee again.  Watched the England-Brazil match at a pub yesterdat afternoon (the telecast here was at 4.30pm). The crowd was a good mix of Brazilian and English fans, so there was an equal amount of cheering going on. We had originally intended to go down to a pub in the city, but my friend who got there first said it was so packed they were turning people away. So we went to a place on the outskirts of the city instead.   The match was pretty exciting. Let it be known, I'm not exactly a huge crazed fan of soccer, but i do enjoy watching the game now and then, especially between good teams. But i think i still prefer watching it by myself, or with a smaller group of people. I guess when you don't share as much passion about the team as the VB-drinking bloke next to you, it's hard to cheer the team on (and in the process slosh beer on your clothes).   But there were these calm collected group of girls at the next table too, watching the game, having chips and wedges and the occasional Lemon Ruski. They looked as out of place as I did, me with my calm claps, plastic smile, and feeling torn between rooting for England (which my friends were, and i'm "supposed" to by default as E-Gene is a Liverpool fan...), and Brazil which i kinda liked for their playing skills. Plus Brazil seemed like the underdogs in the beginning after Owen's goal. (AND!! Ashley Cole wasn't too friendly to Ronaldinho who'd placed his hand on the former's shoulder as a friendly gesture, or what i perceived as a friendly gesture at least, only to have Cole shove his arm away. Plus Cole was equally rude to other players later on.   erm, if anyone disagrees, drop a flooble and we can discuss the finer points of soccer etiquette  Which was why my heart kinda tugged towards the Brazilian players after a while...)  Well, two Bacardi Breezers and many contraband hot peanuts (we bought some from the Asian grocer and snuck them in) later, Brazil's in the semi's for the World Cup. No surprises there i guess, although it would've been nice to see England in the semis after all this time...    Wow...i actually sound like i know my soccer stuff huh? Amazing...    Oh wells, anyways, it being the hols and all, i'm trying to find a job now. Either at a cafe or as a sandwich hand or something. Both seem pretty fun to me... :-) Less boring than an office job. But i need a good environment (pple and boss must be nice), good flexible hours (so i can still enjoy the hols, and spend time with my sis when she comes over), and good pay (not too worried about that, pay here is pretty decent, from $10-15 at least, depending on the job). So praying for opportunities...  All rights, almost 1am now, am planning to go to church tomorrow (after a looooong hiatus...bad huh?) so gotta go sleep! Nites!  Okies, it's late. Will write more (hopefully) tomorrow.  Drop me a flooble yah?

And I also added some new links and that disappeared everytime I refreshed the template menu (in the Edit Blog mode of Blogger) too.  What's happening?

        Freedom of Speech?    I chanced upon this Blog, as how web surfing usually goes, by clicking link to link to link.  It's a page about this lady in the States, who     got  urlLink fired   for what she wrote on her Blog.     What's the state of freedom of speech now? Internet laws are still in their infancy stage - can she sue them for firing her? (Joy? Any comments?)  It makes me wonder, could I get into trouble for what I'm posting right now? If that's the case, my Blog'll never be able to fully express what I think or feel 'coz *gulp* Big Brother's watching...it's Self-Censorship at work...  This sucks doesn't it?  Anyways, I read  urlLink  what she wrote  about her boss and co-workers. It seemed innocent enough, a standard rage-against-the-machine rant.   IMHO, some people are just wayyyyyyyy too sensitive. I mean c'mon, it's not like the whole world gets along right? We all need room to express our pent-up pissed-offness...  The sad thing is, I think the machine won.  urlLink  dooce.com   has been abandoned, although you can still read the  urlLink archives . And this all happened in the good ol' US of A, where the the  urlLink  1st Amendment   clearly states     "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." — The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution    Of course, this means that the   government   can't interfere. But it seems like nosy co-workers can. hmmm....  Oh wells. No big deal right? Singaporeans have always practiced self-censorship right?    But at what price?   Drop me a flooble yah?

        What in the world??    Hmm... i took this test today, off  urlLink  my sis'   blog. Check this out...I'm a   urlLink       Take the  urlLink What High School Stereotype Are You?  quiz, by  urlLink Angel .  Now that's a weird result. 'Coz I've never thought myself as particularly athletic or er...dumb. Then again, if the bumbly butter-fingered buffoon strikes again...(read the 30/5 Blog (" Doli Incapax  and the 50-egg cake") to find out what happened in a previous episode...)  Ah wells.   And yes Tess, I've gone Jewish.   Ya talk sommor and I shvitz ya in ya tuckas ya hear? (That's my yiddish-Queens accent, courtesy of  urlLink The Nanny  )  You know, I actually remember the lyrics for the entire theme song to the show...erm, minus a few gaps of course...      She was selling some make-up in Flushing, Queens  When her boyfriend kicked her out in one of those crushing scenes. What was she to do, where was she to go She was out on her fanny....         So she ?? over to the Sheffield's door She was selling some make-up, the father saw more She had style, she had flair, she was there That's how she became the Nanny...         Who would have thought that this girl we described Would just exactly be what the doctor prescribed          Now the father found her beguiling (watch out C.C.!) And the kids were actually smiling (such a smile indeed) She is the lady in red, while everyone else is in bed...(??) The flashy girl from Flushing, the nanny named Fran!      urlLink  Hear the song in MIDI    urlLink  Actual lyrics    Well, that's  how I remember it. How sad is that? Maybe I am a pea-brianed jock after all...(oh man, i just found out  urlLink  my boyfriend   is a jock too after taking the test! ack, how weird is that?! Two peas in a jock pod...)  Okies, back to my essays. See ya sooon! (Hmm, I suddenly have the urge to pee...flushing...flushing...)

        We interrupt our regularly scheduled programme to bring you this groundbreaking news story!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- This morning at 2.30 am, Miss Sarah Wong, a 22 year-old woman, was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having an allergic reaction to the anti-flatulence medicine, Mylanta.  The allergy symptom is described as a "red rash covering the length of the patient's body, with small bumps appearing on her arms and a little on her face and neck." The patient also suffered from puffy eyes, and a cough resulting from the constriction of her wind-pipes, making it hard for her to breathe.   According to the woman, described by night-shift nurses at the triage station as a "walking asthmatic lobster with bumps", she had overate during dinner, and thus felt its residual effects - a little heartburn, and "wind" in the stomach. She then decided to take Mylanta to help ease her discomfort.  Unfortunately, 10 minutes after ingesting the medicine, she felt flushed, and experienced an itching sensation all over her body, which gradually turned into a bumpy rash on her arms and neck. This was when she decided to call her boyfriend who drove her to a nearby hospital to receive treatment.  According to Miss Wong, "My throat felt tight - probably from the allergy as well, which was why I thought it might be serious. I mean, I've never been allergic to anything in my life before, so I was quite worried."  After a thorough examination by the doctor, it was pronounced that the Mylanta medicine was probably the cause of the reaction, and not, as suspected, the garlic prawns she had consumed for dinner earlier that night.  "I've had Mylanta once before, but didn't have a reaction then, though I was probably still allergic to it. Apparently the first time I took it, my body was just sensitised to it, which explains why I didn't get a rash then. But this time round, my body just reacted against it."  After a dose of antehestamines (injected into her system via a drip - a painful first-time experience as well), and a few hours of sleep under observation, the symptoms receded and the patient was free to go home, with instructions to visit the allergy clinic the following week.  "I'm quite thankful that nothing more serious had happened - I hear you can actually die from allergic reactions! Praise God I'm fine now! I'll probably be more careful with what I consume from now on, and will make a habit of reading the labels in detail, checking the ingredients list. I mean what if I end up turning into a yellow banana with fairy wings the next time round? What happens then?"  30 July 2002 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We now return you to our regulary scheduled programme...

        Chest Pains Part Deaux     Why do I seem to always hurt the ones I love the most?  Why do I lash out?  Sometimes I just wish that they'd disappear. Even when I don't want them to. Or maybe I do.  Sometimes I just want to  yell  and  scream  and  shout  at people. To just fully release!  But I can't. I'm trapped. I worry about consequences and their feelings and remorse that I know I'll feel at the end.  I wish they wouldn't take it personally if I really did that. Even if it really is personal.  If I could have said something just now, I would have said :  Actually I don't know what I would have said.  My heart's beating way too fast for its own good now. It hurts. Can't breathe. Heartburn? Need a doctor. Literally....it hurts to have the blood and vessels pump at such a rate. Ouch. Too quick. Ouch...

         Chest Pains     My heart is thumping really quickly now. Ba-dam-ba-dam-ba-dam. Ouch.   Way too quickly for any good. Heartburn?  Must be the garlic prawns.

        Today...   I miss my sister terribly - it just seems strange not to have her hanging around, irritating me (just joking...). Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and I mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to Tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact.  Maybe it's just the thought that I won't see her for quite a while - with her going to Bristol in Sept/Oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how I miss them all.  Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly? I can honestly say it has been an eventful break, what with all the travelling I've done, and the things I've seen. Still no luck with the job hunt though. Favour Lord, Favour!!  There's still so much to do and see. This semester promises to be a challenging one, with me taking two Film subjects (equating to two 3000 word essays in the middle of the semester! ), hopefully holding fort with a job, and I haven't gotten round to taking those driving lessons I've been saving up for (and which money I have technically spent already on ordinary expenses...). I'm also planning to help out with the Children's Ministry in church, and am also taking an Alpha course, which is sorta a foundation studies thing  - good 'coz it's like going back to the basics of the Bible. Wow - so many things to accomplish - grace needed here!  Well, Shawn's back, which means I see even less of EG 'coz his comp. and best bud are both at Jon's place (Shawn's Jon's new roomie). Woopadeedoo... Everyone always kids that the 2 of 'em are like lovers! (erm, EG and Shawn, not EG and his comp., although now that I think about it, the PC always seems to hum a little when EG's around...) Anyways, the point is, in this little love triangle, I'm the "concubine" you see. Unless you go by EG's version, which is that I'm the "wife", the one he's married to, while Shawn's the "mistress", the one who he really wants to be with. Haha...whatever...  No lah, it's good that he hangs out with his buddy - gives me a lil' space, a lil' of my time you know? So however much I whine that I'll never see as much of EG now that Shawn's back, I'm pretty ok about it, plus I'm glad Shawnie's back too. Miss his sudden rants about society's faults and the various places in Melbourne which are "a bloody rip-off!!"  Welcome back Shawn.

        Chaddy and Dandenongnongnenong   I had a truly wonderful time today. Woke up, went shopping in Chadstone Shopping Mall with my sis, and then drove to Mt. Dandenong where I had terrific devonshire scones, the hugest sundae you've ever seen, and lovely asparagus, chicken and cheese fingers, accompanied by Taylor's tea. Yummm....  Not by myself of course - with E-Gene, Tess and Charles.  Later, it was time spent wondering around looking at nice tea shops and bought essential oils and an oil burner, which unfortunately i cracked much later that night. (No fear, it's still usable - one of those internal cracks caused by sudden change in temperatures when i ran some water over the hot dish).  Added to the depletion in my wallet's funds was the $$ spent on a nice new 3-for-the-price-of-2 book at Border's, which turned out to have a 20% discount for Uni students today. (Charles and EG returned at night to make more purchases).  And that was my day.   Tomorrow should be fun as well - prepping for a b'day party for my sis, who turns 19, and who'll be insisting on wearing the pretty fairy wings she bought today. It'll be a medium-small affair - about 10 pple for a potluck dinner. Little cocktail sausage  hors d'ouevers  anyone?  But tomorrow also marks the 2nd last day I'll see my sis for a really long while. She'll be in Bristol from September/October onwards, for the next 3 years. But she'll be back at least once a year, so that'll be good. Am planning to visit her in Bristol one day, so we can get a Euro Rail pass and travel round Europle. Excitement!  Having Tessa around made me realise a lotta things about myself somehow. In many ways we're so much alike, bumbling, making mistakes as we find our way through life, and it's hard when I realise stuff she does that irritate me probably irritate others when I do it too. Ack. Plus I also seem to nag a lot at her hehe...(which incidentally is very much the same way EG used to nag at me). As she puts it, I tend to treat her like a living doll, often mothering, (even smothering?) her. I guess 'coz I'm too used to being the older sis.  Am trying to let go I guess.   One thing's for sure though, I'm definitely going to be bawling when she leaves on Friday. I can imagine it now, me blubbering away at the airport. Eeek. Really for all the stuff that irritates me when she's here, like not having my own space, small quibbles about inane stuff, I really love having my sister around. Especially 'coz we both share the same warped sense of humour (we're the only 2 idiots who laugh at each other's half-assed jokes, which would usually elicit a loud groan and shake of the head from other people). Underneath certain differences, we   get   each other. Plus it's also cool when we can trick other people over the phone 'coz we both sound the same. Muahahahah....  Ah well, mushy eh? Ahhh, I can still recall the times when we'd fight and scratch and pull each other's hair. Woohooo...  Time to sleep.My bed awaits.

        Conversations with my sis    Tess: Namu? Me: er..namu? Tess: Namunamunamu! Me: You have namu-itis... Tess (shock, horror): Namu is NOT a disease! It's a way of life!!   (Note to readers: I still have absolutely no idea what Namu is. A term purportedly invented by my sis, it still dares to do the unthinkable and defy definition. One up for the think-out-of-the-box-ers) .

        Tess and Tas    In the last few weeks I can safely say I was never for a moment bored.  Spent last Wed to Sun morning in Tasmania, with Charles, E-Gene and my sis Tessa. It was a fantastic getaway, seeing the sights, and generally spending a wonderful time with my sis. Really enjoyed it (I should put up some photos...)  School's starting next week though, which is kinda a drag - where did all the good times go? Plus I'm still on the hunt for a job, which I can't seem to get unless I confirm my timetable. Well, we'll see what happens. This semester promises to be pretty exhausting.  On another note, Mac is gonna start charging me to use the email account and all the other nifty features it has, like iDisk and Homepage. I don't use much of it I guess - mostly just the email account, which is forwarded from my school account anyways. It's just 'coz there's the benefit of having a POP or IMAP account, which means I can d/l me mails. Darn, really dun wanna pay the $$ for it - it's US$99.95 a year, but I get a discount for the first year, so it's $49.95. But it's STILL in US dollars...ack....  Going to Chadstone ("the largest shopping mall in the Southern Hemisphere") and Mt. Dandenong tomorrow. Excited about Ms Marples...this cool English tea place that features, u guessed it, Agatha Christie's Ms Marples character, as it's central character.  Am trying to revamp my blog somewhat  - add in cool stuff, like piccies and I dunno, interesting stuff I guess. Good that Tess is around, so she can help me.   I woke up today with the intention of arriving at 9am in school to help the newbies with enrolment. Guess what time I arrived? 10.45am. Woohoo, that has gotta be a record. In the end, they didn't really need much help, so i just mooshed around, chatting, gossiping, discussing last night's SATC and Buffy episodes (btw, the 2 ep. finale was on tonight - Willow vs Buffy...wooo...scary...to the uninformed, Tara, Willow's gf got shot accidentally and Willow's on this kill-the-world-so-I-feel-better-but-end-up-hurting-myself-and-the-people-I-love rampage. Woah nelly...)  Not that I'm really a fan actually. I just watch it once in awhile when I happen to flip the channel. Demons and witches, pardon me for my lack of liberal-minded thinking, still pretty much freak me out. They might seem harmless on TV, with their wisecracks and all, but that's what the Devil wants you to think doesn't he? Hmmm...  Anyways, time to sleep. Wondering if I should bother to sign up for the Melbourne Blog Meetup or not. Hmm...    Ciao bella!

        The Name Game    I like the name Aidan (Ay-dun). Guess it must be all that   Sex and the City   that I've been watching. I dunno. It just has a nice ring to it doesn't it?  I also like the name Arian, or Arienne, or whatever spelling permutations there are. Pronounced  Ari-ahn  . Or maybe   Ari-ann  .  Nice name for kids don't you think? I can imagine yelling at them to tell 'em dinner's ready. AHHH RIIIIII!!! or DANNY!! Sounds nice eh?  Although I also would like calling my kid by his/her initials too, which is why a middle name is needed. Like CJ or AJ or KC or something. hehe... i once thought of calling my daughter Caitlin Josephine just so i could shorten it to CJ.  E-Gene, sadly, thought naming his kid Aidan Samuel Soh would've been a laugh (yeah we both like the name Aidan. Whoever gets a boy first gets that name! dammit...tick tock tick tock...). Can you imagine the teasing and bullying the poor child would face in the playground? Who wants his kid's initals to be ASS??!! Wah lau eh...damn cruel...  Ah wells, who gets the male mind eh?

        It's one of those days    It's one of those $&^$(*&^& days when you just hate everything and everyone and everything around you. Everything.  I don't understand why I'm so edgy. I just am.  And it's annoying that it just comes out in tight-lipped strained tones when I speak. I apologise to anyone who had to cross my path today.  I hate that i can't express myself properly, fully, and without whining. As one of my good friends Michelle says, "Sarah and whining just go together, but we accept it i suppose. It's part of you."  Sigh.  Sometimes i just wanna lash out and yell words that would make a hard-core sailor blush.

        Coffee, Tea or Me?    Thaaaaaaat's right. I'm becomin' a *ahem* barista, or in more colloquail terms,  ka-fei mei . Yep, just applied at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf round the corner from my place, and hopefully will get a job there, serving people their cappucinos and cafe lattes. Yay...can't wait.  No seriously. I can't wait. Need money to supplement my expensive habits like shopping, eating and taking public transport. You'd be amazed at how much I spend a week. Not to mention groceries, rent and phone bills.  But being a  ka-fei mei  isn't too bad an idea. I don't really mind it actually, mostly 'coz the hours are flexible, you get to interact with people and you aren't stuck behind a desk and computer. It's fun actually, which is why I'm pretty excited about it, IF I get the job.  The funny thing about Melbourne is, to get any job, you've gotta have a resume. EVEN for part-time work at coffee joints. Strange huh? Back home they just make you fill up a form, and if you look pleasant enough, speak good english, and can tell the difference between a mocha ice-blended and a mocha caramel ice-blended (it's the caramel,  duuhhh ), you're a shoo-in for the job.  Here, they get you to fill in a form, and a resume with REFERENCES mind you, people they can call to vouch for you, just in case you're a schizophrenic psychopath about to suddenly attack customers with scalding hot Special Dutch Chocolate. Can you just imagine that?  Sttstttsttt....must get foam just right, stttststttt, just right, caramel mocha, mocha...waitaminit. Did she just give me FIVE CENTS LESS?   Hey lady, you're five cents SHORT. It's four ninety-FIVE lady, FIVER at the end lady, heard that? Says so on the screen! FIVE CENTS LADY! FIVE CENTS GEDDIT? FIIIIIVVVEEE CENTS!! FIIIIIVVVVVEE WHOLE CENTS!!!! What, you don't know how to count huh? AHHHHHHHHH!!!   and I suddenly launch at the poor unsuspecting woman desperately trying to dig out the coin from her purse with trembling fingers, screaming like a banshee, spilling caramel and creamy milk everywhere, a bulbous vein throbbing at my temple.   Phew!    Erm, in case my future employers are somehow reading this, I'm NOT REALLY INSANE. I've NEVER been institutionalised at a mental hospital before (unless you count my secondary school years...)   Thank you. Just needed to clear that up.  Well, the job's all in God's hands. Praying for it, and going by faith. I really want a job that has a good working environment, good colleagues and boss, good flexible hours, and good pay (it's pretty standard pay here - The Bean'll prob. pay me about $10-12 an hour, a rate I'll never get back in S'pore!). Hours-wise, i wrote on my application form that i'd prefer the morning 7am-12pm slots Tues to Fridays (although negotiable), simply 'coz that frees up the rest of the day, and my sis is coming to visit. And i don't really have to wake up that early 'coz i live pretty near. So praying! They'll probably call me soon to arrange an interview. I'll sell the fact that I can spell most people's names, an asset when writing them down on the plastic ice-blended cups. (can you imagine? The Bean at Junction 8 Bishan spelt my name as Sey-la! Wah lau eh....)  Okies. gtg now. Nite nite.  Drop me a flooble yah?

         Daisies and Daffodils     Oh yesterday was wonderful. Helped out with Daffodil Day, which is basically a day the Cancer Council of Victoria has to raise funds for Cancer Research.  It was really fun - woke up at 6 plus am (can u believe it??!! And I'm NOT a morning person...), went down to Flinder's St. Station and sold all sorts of Daffodil-type merchandise, including pins, ribbons, pens, a cute teddy bear (which was dressed for summer complete with thongs on his paws), a footy ball and bunches of real daffodils! I got to wear this Daffodil Day t-shirt, which I even managed to keep (though I really wanted to keep this yellow pouch we used to collect money in, but couldn't. Shucks....)  So there we were, a bunch of girls at a table outside the station, selling stuff. 3 of us decided to wander down a lil' further, outside Maccers on Swanston St., and managed to sell quite a bit too. We even got our picture taken by this passing photog.  All in all, a really fun start for yesterday. I'd definitely do it again, esp. since it was for a good cause (or as Ew Lee puts it, "buy a daffodil, support a chawitab...a chawribaba...a cha.. ah-fegget-it, it's for Cancer Research!!") and people do make an effort and come up and support the cause. Best of all,   hello , yellow is   so  my  colour !

        The Big Issue   I saw him at Flinder's Street Station today. Got off the tram and bought a copy.  At least I think it was him. He sounded different. Maybe he was just another gruff old man.  I hope it was him.

        Why?   I don't have a regular job any longer. They told me yesterday, after my shift, that they were implementing a change in the schedule or something, and would call me as and when they needed me. So now it's a casual basis kinda thing. They were pretty vague about a reason why this had to happen, and I was still under shock so I didn't press for details. I figured maybe 'coz they had 2 new pple, this Shanghainese woman and man, who seemed like new partners or soemthing. Ah dunno lah.  I honestly think it's a cheap way of firing someone and letting them down nicely, YET keeping them hanging on your lil' pinky finger so you can depend on a filler when you need someone.  This REALLY sucks. I mean, what the? After 2 weeks of training etc. And I really think I did pretty ok, and got along with everyone. If it was just a trial, tell me it was a trial. I shifted my classes around so I could fit the job in. Now they do this. I have a bleedin' 4 hour break on Wednesdays for goodness sake!  I'd better cancel the scheduled transfer that's supposed to move $$ every week from my bank account to a savings maximiser one. Was planning to put aside $$ each week, earn interest, and have $$ at the end of the semester to fly back home for hols. Now  that  idea's shot.  Happened to my friend, who was working the Mon & Thurs shift too.  This really stinks.  On the upside, at least I'm using the time to get some research done. ONLY 4 weeks left. Haven't done much. Arrrghhhhh.  Stomach hurts now. Gastric and wind. Am not daring to try Mylanta again. Tried 3 other forms of medication though, to no effect. Sigh.  Only looking forward to the presentation for TV Cultures we've been working at. We're gonna majorly impress the pple, and whoop everyone's ass! As Michalengelo (of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) would say,   Cowabunga Duuude!

        Regret   Ever had one of those moments where you coulda shoulda woulda done something if you weren't frozen by nervousness or inertia? One of those moments where you miss an opportunity and it  never really quite comes round again?  Today one of the vendors for The Big Issue came up the tram. He was a well-built old man, his face tan and leathery, his hair silver, and each of the many wrinkles on his gruff visage told of the things he had seen and done. He stood tall, proud, save for a scruffy grey sweater that had seen better days, and a Big Issue vest and sling bag, both worn at the edges.  He sat on the seat in front of me, facing the lady on my left. I stole a quick peek at the cover - a smiling Rachel Griffiths next to a headline for Six Feet Under. I averted my eyes - I didn't feel like buying a copy. True, the money went to a good cause - the magazine employed the homeless to raise funds for the homeless, helping them get back on their feet. But except for the 5 copies I bought last year, when the idea of giving back to society in such a convenient way was still a novel idea, I hadn't approached a vendor to buy one since; I didn't have time to read anyway.  "Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan, young lady?" said the old man to a pony-tailed woman who'd just come up the tram. She just smiled and shook her head.  "You know why I'm asking don't you? he pressed on, the magazine in his hand, a wry smile on his lips. She smiled and nodded, then turned away. "Yeah, not much of a fan myself, just like the photographs," he said, smiling to himself, as he twisted the magazine in his hand.  "Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?" he asked the bespectacled teenage boy that came up next. "No," he replied simply.  "Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?" he asked the lady sitting across the aisle. She shook her head, too absorbed in her own thoughts.  "Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?" he asked the lady next to me. I looked down at my shoes, then stared straight ahead. He didn't bother asking me.  He got off the tram at the next stop. My heart was pounding, my head was screaming. I should have done something. I could have bought a copy. He'd just fallen on tough times. He could be someone's father, someone's grandfather. He could have saved lives. I could have invited him back for a cuppa, we could have talked. We would both have made a new friend.  I looked out the window, and saw him cross the road to Flinders Street Station. He stood outside in the cold, wrapped in his grey sweater, holding The Big Issue, smoking a cigarette.  The tram moved off. I opened my bag, and saw my wallet. I took it out, looked through, saw that I had a ten-dollar bill, and a five-dollar one.   I could have bought a copy. But I didn't. I was afraid. I was ashamed.   19 August 2002

        It's been awhile...    Yep, sorry haven't been on for awhile, mostly coz v.v. bz with school and all. Subjects this sem are  TV Cultures  (expert on this!!),  MarComm  (although unlike the one i took in Mass Comm...more theoretical),  Italian National Cinema   (must read up on fascism etc etc..), and   Contemporary Hollywood Cinema   (can someone PLEASE explain "2001: A Space Odyssey" to me please??!!)  Special Mention Alert: Welcome PRIYANCA!! Yes, this is my blog....however, if you are reading this right now,   get back to work!!  . Tsk tsk... I wonder what AWARE would think of their brightest young talent if they found out she was spending time reading people's blogs instead of doing her job... tsktsk...hehehe  Am v.v. tired nowadays, mostly 'coz of the early starts. Am NOT a morning person, and I hate having 9 am classes. eep....skipped a couple already. And I have another tomorrow!  The  job so far is pretty cool.  Getting to know the people at work a lil' better, and Jah-mes seems to be loosening up. He's actually a pretty nice guy. :-)   I guess one of the perks of the job are the free coffee and food. I mean the last place I worked at was so anal about making money it charged its employees if they wanted to eat the food there! While they were working! I mean I can understand if any day you just happened to pop by and ordered something, you'd have to pay, but I mean come on, if you've been working there 4 hours in a row and there's no lunch break and if you wanna grab something to munch on while there weren't customers, you still have to pay?? So much for employee benefits.   Phew   I hoped all that made sense.  Whatever it is, I like how the job's going so far. Have decided to take one of the church aunties' advice and put aside a lil' each week (after tithing of course) as part of a savings plan. There's this fund/investment management firm where I can transfer $$ from my bank account, earn interest through them, and transfer the $$ back anytime I want. It's pretty good, and the current rate is 4.75% on yr principal, calculated   daily  , with no other charges, and no minimal principal amount. Sounds pretty good eh? Hopefully can save enough to go for a lil' holiday back home to S'pore at the end of the year. :-)  Okies, enough for now. Here are some things I MUST do, and soon...  1. Stop munching on those addictive Arnott's Mint Slices  2. Reduce chockie intake - just now the house (that's Evelyn, Me, EG, Shawn, Chris, and Jon who wasn't around 'coz he was out) took a stock take and realised that ALL my snacks had choc. content, even the healthy muesli bars...sigh  3. Start exercising - which may be hard 'coz I can't make the Taibox classes this sem, and my ankle's acting up. Btw, haven't even started using my new running gear!! eek...   Oh yes, on this note, just caught a really freaky episode of Smallville, this Clark Kent-in-highschool drama. A pretty-but-plump (aren't we all?) girl was desperate to lose weight so she started drinking veggie shakes made out of veggies found in her garden. Thing is, some meteors from Krypton had landed there when Clark aka Superman landed on Earth, and so the veggies were genetically altered somehow. Everytime she drank them, her fat content reduced dramatically (liposuction w/o the tubes), so she became slim pretty fast! Woohoo...BUT after awhile she started getting really hungry, and the only way she could successfully stave off the hunger was by consuming another being's fat - like a deer, and this mean guy that used to bully her. Hows   that   for revenge??!! Creeeppy..."come one come all, meet the the Incredible Shrinking Girl Who Sucks Up Your Fat!!" eeeek.....   4. Start on essay research, which eek, are ALL due in FIVE weeks time! (one of the classes is TV Cultures, and have been doing   tonnes   of research for it - heheh watching the tube that is....)  5. Finally change the "Shpiel of the Week"  And now off to bed. I hate early classes. zzzzz  Drop me a flooble or  urlLink SIGN MY GUESTBOOK!!

        A new dawn awaits   All right! I have a new job up, and it's starting tomorrow! Excitment - it's just a simple cafe job, and I'm not sure what my duties exactly are, but it's in school and it's income so I'll try my best. Really need favour in the manager's eyes!  Phew, getting this job was such an ordeal, mostly becasue I've never received any replies to the resumes I sent out over the hols. But maybe it's good 'coz mebbe God wanted me to hold out for this, esp. since in school, and I got to fully devote my time in the hols to doing me-stuff, and hang out with my sis.  Well, the cafe is run by these Shanghainese. I have no either what posessed me to do so, but I spoke to them in Mandarin! Argh, my half-past six broken Chinese. Eek.  It all started innocently enough. I went down to the cafe, dropped off the CV, spoke to the manager in English, he in his Chinese-accented English too.  The following week, I got a missed call from them, so I called back. The guy I spoke to (who wasn't the manager though), started speaking to me in Mandarin, so that's how it all started. I went down the next day with my timetable, and spoke to the manager in Mandarin, thinking, after all, hey I handled a whole conversation yesterday in the language, I can do this too. The manager seemed a little surprised at my speaking Mandarin though. Whatever it was, I was really proud of the fact I asked for his name before I left in the polite Mandarin form:    Oh, dui bu qi, qing wen ning gui xing?   (Oh excuse me, by the way, may I know your name?)  To which he replied: Oh,   Jah-mes    Teeheeheee...yeppers,  Jahmes  teeheeeheee  He called later that week, woke me up on a Friday morning, asking me (in Mandarin of course) if I could start work the following week. YES!! I was really happy - Praise God! Thing is, that early in the morning, ( 11  a.m. mind you - I mean who wakes up at   such  an ungodly hour?), I couldn't form the proper words to reply in Mandarin. So you can imagine how the conversation went:    Qing wen ze shi Huang xiao jie shi ma?   (Pardon me is this Miss Wong?)    Ahh..shi shi!   (Yes, yes!)    Wo shi chong XXX cafe da lai de.   (I'm calling from XXX cafe.)    Oh dui dui dui!   (Oh yes yes yes!)    Oh dui dui dui.  (Was he making fun of me??)  Qing wen ni zhao dao gong zuo le ma?   (Oh yes yes yes. May I ask if you've found a job yet?)    Oh hai mei you.   (Oh not yet.)  Blah blah blah...I was really struggling with it. He was asking me if I could shift my subjects around so I could work on Tuedays and Wednesdays. I just simply couldn't articulate properly what I wanted to say, and had to repeat myself a couple of times, peppering my broken Mandarin with a smattering of English words, like Timetable etc. Ughhh.  Finally, after everything was settled, I was about to say bye when he said,     Ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (Your Mandarin really isn't very good is it? -> said as more of a statement than a question)   I was stunned to say the least. So I just said the only thing that popped into my head.    Hah??   (Hah??)    Wo shuo ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (I said your Mandarin isn't very good is it?)    Oh dui, er, nah shi ying wei, er, Ying Wen shi wo di yi ge, er, language.   (Oh yes, er, that is because, er, English is my first, er, language.)    Nah ni jiu jiang Ying Wen ba.   (You can speak in English then.)    Oh hao, hao.    (Oh, yes yes -> I mean I really didn't know what to say. It just threw me! Sigh - Shanghainese are famous for their bluntness)    Xia ge xing qi jian.   (I'll see you next week then.)    Ah, dui.   (Ah, yes.)  E-Gene, who overheard the conversation, put it very succintly: "Man, your Chinese really sucks!"  Sigh.

        Tribute   Yes the weather is fine today on the red carpet. Fans are cheering wildly as the winners arrive for the annual Bloop Awards, bearing bright smiles and the prerequisite V-for-victory sign for paparazzi pictures. We cross over now to centrestage where the award ceremony is already under way...  ...well I have to say I was glad Charles won the LSA*, I mean after all...oh! We're back! Well, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, the winner of the Great Buddy Award is none other than...drum roll please...Bharatha Moorthy of Serangoon Avenue 2!!  For your compassionate concern and calling me all the way from Singapore after reading my Blog and finding out about my short hospital trip, worrying when I didn't answer the phone the first time, and for also reassuring my sister that I was all right (who incidentally didn't even KNOW what had happened 'coz she hadn't been reading my blog - so much for keeping tabs on me), I dub thee my GREAT BUDDY!  [crowd cheers]  Our next winner is no stranger to the Bloop Awards, having won both the prestigious True Blue Award as well as the Warm Embrace countless times. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of this year's Physical Protection Award 3 years in a roll is E-Gene Soh of Southbank!  [crowd cheers and screams]  For dropping everything and rushing me to the hospital at 2 am in the morning, and staying by my side as the anti-allergy medication took effect and I dropped off to sleep, and then getting up again later that morning at 7 am to fetch me home from the hospital, I dub thee my KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR!  [wolf whistles and a standing ovation ensues]  An Honorable Mention also goes to Jonathan Chew of Southbank for allowing me to use up his download credits on the last day of July. Thank you for ensuring that my Mac is now fully equipped with the latest software applications (and also for that really nice salmon lunch.)  [clap clap clap!!]  Well that wraps up tonight's ceremony! Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you all had a wonderful time, and thank you for coming to this year's Bloop Awards!  Please exit to your left and would you kindly refrain from stealing the decor pieces on your way out. Good night!   *Long-Suffering Award

        New Additions   I have just composed my first limerick, all in the space of 5 minutes on Friday, after Evie told me we were going Doncaster for Yum Cha!   My First Limerick    There once was a girl from Doncaster Who liked to eat chips, wood and plaster She fell ill one day Got taken away Leaving her house looking somewhat lacklustre   Geddit? Geddit? She was eating her house that's why she was ill and...and... (silence from the audience)  Sigh, unfortunately My First Limerick hasn't quite taken off...no rave reviews, and recitations have been met by either puzzled looks or blank expressions. Ah wells...maybe next time.  What do YOU think of it? (And also the Brinjal Song)? Drop me a flooble or leave a bl00p!!

        That Purple Vegetable    Music: Am listening to  urlLink  John Mayer's  Room for Squares   . VERY VERY nice!! I highly recommend it for your (easy) listening pleasure...   Here's another Silly Song with Sarah!!    The Brinjal Song (aka An Ode to E-Gene)    You're a Purple Brinjal You like to dance and sing When you shake your brinjal butt It makes a sound that goes ding ding   Ok ok I know, why is EG a brinjal? Just thought he looks like one lah. Btw, do you know the other names for Brinjal are Aubergine and Eggplant? Teeheehee...that said, I don't really like eating it, unless it's the Lasagne-version that Wally taught me to make....very very yummy!   Brinjal-Lasagne Recipe   1. Fry brinjal till translucent (like how you would an onion I guess) 2. On baking tray lined with baking paper, place a layer of fried brinjal 3. Pour spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce on top of the brinjal 4. Repeat with additional layers of brinjals and sauce until desired height 5. Top off with a sprinkling of cheese (parmesan, mozzie, tasty, chedder, swiss, whatever you like) 6. Bake in oven till cheese has melted (I usually put it at a really high temperature so I don't have to wait too long...but that means you gotta watch it so it doesn't burn)  Voila! Yummy brinjal-lasagne!

       What a day...  I spent a very enjoyable weekend so far. Friday was spent at the DFO near Moorabin airport, with lotsa nice cheap stuff to buy...got a pair of Just Jeans for $39.95, and EG bought me a pair of slippers for $12. And I got sidetracked by a $12.95 top which I was totally indecisive about, and I didn't buy in the end...was too conscious that I'd eventually decide it wasn't flattering after I bought it and wouldn't wear it in the end...eep...  Yesterday was a great day spent with some church friends, a bunch I got closer to through the Alpha course we take in church. We had Yum Cha, then watched The Bourne Identity (featuring many out-of-focus shots), then watched a lil' footy (it was the Grand Final after all - the Brisbane Lions beat the Collingwood Magpies 75-66) on the big screen at Crown Casino while our friends played a lil' rapid roulette hehe...  I think it was pretty great when we came back and hung around, playing cards and a lil Twister. All in all, a very enjoyable day spent with them. I know how I've totally not really felt comfortable at ACCF, primarily because of the lack of a group of pple to hang out with, mostly 'coz they were  Aussie-Asian so there was a huge difference when we talked, even for simple slang terms and the wavelength. But this bunch is pretty cool - mostly Malaysians, but still got the   lors   and the  lahs  hehe... It's a great funny bunch of people - funny as in we laugh a lot.  Last night me EG and Shawn (and Evie for a lil' while) played Upwords...imagine the ingenuity that is involved when you really can't build any more words...we came up with stuff like "Quita" (for quitter, said 'hood-style), "Sista", "Gemz", and we allowed Shawn's "Fie" 'coz it's Ye Olde English...hehe. I really like playing board games with people, it's fun. I remember how every birthday and Christmas 'til I was 12, I'd get my parents to bring me to Toys R Us so I could get boardgames. I had Payday, Monopoly, Go for Broke, The Game of Life, Taboo (bought it on my 12th Christmas, and am still playing the game 10 years on, even though the set is a different one 'coz I lost the old one) and lots more. I loved, and still do love, boardgames...  My new obsession right now is crosswords puzzles, which I do with EG or whoever is available to hazard a guess at a seven-letter word for "practiced boxing" (answer below*). That said, I'm stumped at an eight-letter word for "announces". The 6th letter is an R though...anybody can help? Please post a flooble or a bl00p if you have any clues....thanks!!     * The answer is "Sparred"

       Jazz and the Charleston  Oooh..went to watch  urlLink The Cat's Meow   starring Kirsten Dunst, Cary Elwes and also Edward Hermann, Rory's grandad in Gilmore Girls, who plays William Randolph Hearst, the 1920s newspaper titan. Quick trivia: Did you know that Citizen Kane was supposedly based on his life (Hearst I mean, not Hermann).  The Cat's Meow is based on the novel written by Elinor Glyn, about what really happened on a yachting trip in 1924. Actually, 15 November 1924, to be exact - hehe my birthdate! ooooooooh...  Movie and the webstie have really nice 1920s-style songs...it's actually playing in the BG as I type. And the Charleston dances they did seemed pretty funky too hehe.  Am plannign to watch Lilo n Stitch later, prob at Highpoint. Some lighthearted 'toon eh to jazz up the week. Man, I've really been watching lotsa movies these couple of days...prob to make up for the months of abstinence hehe.  okies, cheerio. And please remember, flooble's down, so leave a bl00p (comment lah)!

        Yueah Babay...   I have returned from watching Goldmember. Hmmm...dunno why, didn't laugh as much as I thought I would...maybe my expectations were a little high? I know, I know...how do u have high expectations when u watch Austin Powers right? But no, I actually like watching shall we say, *Doctor Evil-style finger quotes* "stupid"  movies...like American Pie, Road Trip (although Tom Green was *trey* gross) and the list goes on...  Overall, i think the best part of the show was the cameos in the beginning and the West-Side Story song n dance sequence... pretty nifty legwork I would say. Beyonce Knowles had great abs, bland acting - no sparkles there.   The highlight was doing the typical Singaporean thing after the movie - supper! Except it was more like dinner 'coz we hadn't eaten. We took our first trip to Bismi! A regular Prata shop, in Melbourne! With yummy prata and teh tarik, and it was pretty cheap too...full meal (2 pratas n tarik) for only $4.90. Yummers...  Oy...so full now... edge of puking.  My sis is leaving for Bristol tomorrow night. Just reading her blog makes me sad in away, like she'll be so much further away - it's not just a 2-3hr time difference anymore (depending on daylight savings), but much much more - the other end of the world! I will really miss her.   Somehow I feel and wish I could be a better sis n I dunno...be able to give her greater emotional support. I think I'm prob. one of those "church"-type people who she referred to in her blog, who don't really know what to say and give tried-n-true advise, 'coz I probably don't understand the emotional turmoils she goes through. I'm less angsty I guess. The 2 of us are quite different in many ways, even since we were young. She tended to rebel and question the system, and still does (which i'm very proud of actually, she doesn't just accept things "as they are", unlike me), while I just happily went about my way... sure we'd fight all the time thought - hated each other when we were kids, and I really thought she was a pest when I was in secondary school  - i remember once, when i went back to get my 'O'-level results, n she popped by to find out how i did (she was in Sec 1 then), and I was like "Why you come?...aiyah just go back to your class lah". I guess I really hurt her then. And even when she started hanging round my friends, like the Old Awake friends, and the Tsunamit people - i guess i didn't like her infringing on my "territory".  Irony is, she's prob closer to them now than I ever was... :-)  I think one thing that stands out vividly in my mind when we were kids was that she always had a flair for the dramatic. On a trip to China, she stood at the front of the bus, in her little white jumpsuit and rainbow-coloured checked shirt, and sang into the mike connected to the bus' audioo system, while everyone clapped and cheered along. Wah lau eh - attention seeker! haha...But there was a really sweet side to her too. We had had a fight, or a brawl should i say, what with the pinching scratching hairpulling etc. I think i hit her too hard, and she started crying and ran to my mum, who took the cane out. I ran to the corner, and was really prepared for a whacking man, 'coz she really looked pissed. And then my sis ran in front of me, spread her hands out, and said "No! Don't beat   jie jie !!" So sweet right? In my head I was thinking "Wah lau eh, trying to act again! Watch too much Channel 8 serials ...." but at the same time still relieved coz my mum's face softened....haha :-) Oh the stories of childhood.  To Tess, if you're reading this b4 your flight tomorrow. Take care, God bless, and you'll do fine in Bristol. I love you very very much.  Goodnight.

        Yay!!   Oh happy happy sunshine song! I have completed 3 of the essays due today, and the 4th's due the day after the hols end. Yippee! Can at least relax for a bit over the weekend.  Tomorrow will be spent at church in the afternoon, then it's Goldmember at night...muahahhah. And Sunday's gonna be a potluck dinner with lotsa friends, sorta celebrate the end of the term and the beginning of the 2-week break. Yay...  Excitement!  Today was pretty taxing...only started writing the TV Cultures today, and it's due at 4pm! Had planned what to wirte etc. last night, so wasn't supposed to take too long, but ah wells...in the end, finished at 4.30pm (500 extra words, eep, hope i don't get penalised), rushed to get everything printed out, reached school at 5.30pm. But it wasn't too bad, I think they might not count it as late 'coz they usually check essays on monday mornings anyways. Whatever it is, nothing I can do now.  Very sleep deprived...aching body...  In lieu of flooble, leave a comment!

       Tired...   EEk..the last leg of my essay mash..trying to read all the stuff on domesticity for TV Cultures essay, except I did EXACTLY what the readings said lotsa pple so with TV..watch it in the background.   How intertextual/postmodern is that? A reading of me reading my readings while participating in the reading of televisual forms. Burp.  Ever tried speed reading? I did what I was taught eons ago in secondary school - place a finger in the middle of the sentence, and try to read the whole thing without moving yr eyeballs. Theory is to encapsulate the sentence at a glance, letting your mind fill in gaps in the sentence (ie pick out key words). IT'S NOT POSSIBLE without incurring any serious injury. Verdict: V.V. painful, only try if you're already   pah ciao    I saw my TV Culture's lecturer at the gelati place just now - what a coinkidink (sarah-speak for "coincidence"). Don't think he recognised me though. Which was just as well...  Sleep now....

        Feminista   I've recently come across this website, called  urlLink Big Bad Chinese Mama  . It's a really interesting website posing as an asian mail order bride service that serves to, as the manifesto says, catch men in the act (of porn-ing).  I sent the website's url round to a couple of close friends, little knowing the stir it caused. But it was a really good stir, as in we started debating about the site's effectiveness at subverting patriarchal oppression, whether it's too controversial and nihilistic with the male-bashing and all.  This was what I wrote:   In my humble opinion, I figure that our resident big bad mama is not simply ranting against the patrairchal standards of today. However much we can argue about gender equality, about our roles in society, about men and women walking hand in hand towards that great light of peace and harmony, she is using humour as a way to deconstruct the ideologies of femininity today. (I've personally used the same approach, albiet in a less confrontational way, to satirise the global female fashion industry in my project for class last year - yes yes, boast boast teeheehee)  It's a pretty in-your-face, confrontational gesture i suppose. What I think is good about the site is that it stands to subvert current norms of thinking, through parody. Yeah, we're pretty much living in a post-everything world, post-feminist, post-modern yadayada. The fight has been fought, the battle has been somewhat won, but the war for equality still goes on (wow, how prosaic...). Like Velle said, the branches of feminsism stretch far and wide; i think it's all down to the whole personal-as-political approach again - i.e. if you feel that women and men play diff roles, so be it. If you feel we should use whatever power we have (sexual or otherwise) to do whatever we can to climb to the top and change things from within , so be it.  Personally, I'm more of the humour-works-to-deconstruct kinda thing. Mostly 'coz (a) my kinda humour does not serve to uphold my pretty lotus blossom image (yes i can hear the coughs in the background! i know who you are!!), and (b)Ê i have a pretty wacked out sense or humour and damn, i'm proud of it!  Also, i think the fact that we're debating and thinking about it (the website as well as feminism at large) legitimises the topic anyways - yay! one up for the womyn!!   Another point I want to make is also this:  The fact is, that the issues for women today lies not in debating about feminism, or taking up the cause or whatever. When we discuss women's issues casually,  (even with the same women who took my feminsit film n tv theory class last sem), and I say that i'm a feminist, it's always greeted with a blank stare and "oh, so what do you do?". Everyone equates feminism with activism and the bra-burning butch stereotype. I think feminism today is more subversive, and with the use of new technology (unfortunately a world equated with the techno-geeks-are-usually-men idea), that's what bigbadchinesemama.com aimed to do.  I mean I told my friend I use to clean my boyfriend's bathroom for him, and she said "oh, you're definitely not a feminist that way". I had to explain, firstly I liked cleaning bathrooms coz it was cathartic for me in a weird way (must be all the fumes i've been inhaling from the Jif bottle), and secondly he wasn't free to do it and we needed to get it sparkling for the real estate agent's inspection, and thirdly it's nice to do something for someone, man or woman. If she had asked me to clean her bathroom for her, I would have (if and only if it wasn't in too deplorable a shape!!!).  Sigh...the defences we have to keep coming up with...

       A Tribute to Shawn the Koala-who-thinks-he's-a-pirate   *ahem*   You're a little Ko-ah-lah   (menacing "arrhhhh" courtesy of Shawn, along with curled paws and scrunched shoulders)  You're my little Ko-ah-lah (arrrrhhhh)   You like to suck on Eucalyptus   You're a little Ko-ah-lahhhh (arrrrhhhh)    It all began when Shawn dyed his hair, so it looks like he's got a lil' tuft of red on top. Then this lady at a shop he patronised said he looked realllll cute, like a, like a koala!   And then this ditty came to me just now, while we were just standing round the kitchen, and I was drinking my tea, and he was washing the dishes. Yep, inspiration strikes everywhere!  12 Sept 2002

        Alpha and Omega   I just returned from Alpha camp over the weekend, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. It was pretty far from Melbie though, in Upper Plenty, so far it was hardly on the Melway map. Eep. But the place was so fantastic! The  dorm rooms, the toilet, all really neat and clean, esp. the bathroom. All the amenities you needed, great food plus A REAL FIREPLACE. What more could you ask for!?!!  We spent the 2D/2N there enjoying each other's company, and learning more about the Holy Spirit - part of the Alpha course I'm taking at church, sorta like a foundation back-to-basics of Christianity kind a thing. Real good stuff.  EG had a great time too. Probably 'coz there was some serious male bonding going on. Him and a bunch of other like-minded noisy guys, sitting around after lunch, talking about cars n stuff. SO blokey...I made my friend Alan promise never to turn into them, guys sitting around congratulating themselves on being the masters of the universe. He said no guarantees there. Sigh. What happened to all the Sensitive New Age Guys?   One highlight was learning Mafia, this really interesting game where someone gets "killed" and you gotta find out who did it. Think Murderer meets Bluff meets Survivor and you get the gist. 3 Mafiosi, 1 Doctor, 1 Spy, and the rest are Civilians (9 people in all, plus 1 Game-master). You should see the heated debates as everyone tried to defend themselves and prevent who they thought were compadres from being voted out. VERY layered game, and you never know who's bluffing. Very fun, and also very interesting 'coz you've got this group of Christians who are essentially lying to each other...hmmm....hehe  Anyways, it was a great experience, and I'd definitely do it again if I had the chance. Right now, slogging n trying to keep up with the essay schedule. Cheerios

        It All Makes Sense Now!!    As you all know, I've been writing Silly Songs (aptly named Silly Songs with Sarah) for awhile now. To the unenlightened, Silly Songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile, outta blue, totally off-guard. They could be lyrics to well-known songs (a la Weird Al Yankovic) or just, well, songs with a tune.  Here's a sample:   (To the tune of Kylie's "I Just Can't Get You Outta My Head")   I just can't get you outta my spleen Boy oh boy do I need anti-fungal cream   Also:   (To the tune of P.O.D.'s "Alive")   I can't see at night For the very first time I believe I am blind So blind  I can't drive past nine Otherwise I'll die But night blindness is fine So fine     Anyways, I just came across, in one of my readings, a man named Philip J. Kitchen!! So now this ditty I came up with a YEAR ago, FINALLY makes sense!   *Ahem*   Kill Kenny Chicken....But don't kill the Kitchen.... (repeat)   Please don't ask me who Kenny Chicken is. I have no idea. Just some figment of my subconcious I suppose. BUT! Now we DO know how kitchens can be killed - when they're human!! Heeheeheeteeheehee... (Previously,  "don't kill the kitchen" came with a "with germs lah!" reply to people's perplexed expressions.)  There of course have been times when these ditties have come back to bite me on the ass, unintentionally of course (no malicious content, and all G-rated songs ok?!). I recorded one as my voice-mail message, and left it there for quite awhile. Thing is, a potential employer for this job I really wanted to try out for after I graduated, but which I thought wouldn't come through 'coz he hadn't called for months since I put the application in, finally gave me a tinkle on the phone! And I didn't hear the phone. So it got redirected. And he heard the song. And this was the message he left:  "Er, wow...that's er real interesting er....anyways, this is Colin Gomez from Perfect 10....just wondering blah blah..."  ARGHFFF!!   5 September 2002

         Run Forrest Run!     I went for a run just now. Sick of just moaning about me weight and fat, and took action!! yay.  EXCEPT. My feet are killing me! I'm slightly flat-footed so it really hurts when it's pounding on the ground. The run wasn't too bad at all - 1min jog, 1 min walk. Nice pace. But the feet...oy the feet...  In other news, just heard that SIA might be resurrecting Ansett - the airline company gone bust here. Hmmm...  In other other news, am doing MarComm n my lecturer is a major slacker. Can't be bothered to put the lecture notes up on the net, which he's been promising to do so, so I don't have access to the notes I missed. And there were many.  Whatever it is, am so positively swamped with work now. Really need grace to get through this!! Which is why I haven't been bloggin much hehe. Sorry guys...  Okies, better get back to the daily grind....

       The Day When Many Things Happened  Let's start at the very beginning...a very good place to start...   12 pm   Woke up feeling really shitty, 'coz the night before I was all tense about my Italian Cinema take home exam question, which I had no idea how to write 'coz it had to center around 2 specific topics from a list. One topic, Migration, I could relate to the film (Looking for Alibrandi), but I had absolutely no clue which other to pick.  So I just read my Bible, and it seemed specifically tailored for me, talking about how we should rejoice in trials. To quote some movie I watched, "That which doesn't break us only makes us stronger". Was it Arnie? I don't remember.  So I decide to just pick one of the topics,  Mezzogiorno , and find out more about it, 'coz (a) it was part of the week's readings on Post War politics, which I could possibly link to Alibrandi and Migration, and (b) 'coz I wanted to know what it actually meant in English.  Typed in a search in askjeeves, and voila! It basically refers to the South Italy region, encompassing Sicily, Calabria etc. Woopee! Italian-Australian immigrants always harken back to their homeland, esp. Sicily, and it was done so in Alibrandi. Yay! Praise God.   1.30 pm  Mobile phone rang and I ran to pick it up. The caller ID said "Anonymous", so it was from a private number. "Hello? Is this Sarah?" "Yes, it is." "Hi, I'm Mike from Gloria Jean's Coffees? I received your email early this morning. Could you come in sometime for an interview?"  In short, I'm meeting Mike, who's wearing a black shirt, tomorrow regarding a position as a barista/customer service staff at a new store they're opening on Bourke Street. Praise God for opportunities. I also applied for another job, a Call Centre one (answering questions on an upcoming govt. campaign), but they haven't got back to me.   3.15 pm  Am still on the bleeding tram when I should be in class already. I'm giving a presentation for my Italian Cinema class!   3.25 pm  Phew, class hasn't started yet. Prayer really works.   3.55 pm  Presentation went ok. Everyone was anxious to go to the pub (rest of tute lesson @ pub.  Cool huh?) so they weren't really listening. What to do, it's the last tute for the semester. Anyways, didn't join them - on to the next presentation, for TV Cultures.   4.00 pm  Well the Multimedia festival went well, though it ended late. Everyone's presentation was really good! Sadly, ours didn't win a prize (4 prizes for 7 groups, plus door prize draws). My 'honourable mentions' go to the group that talked about Phua Chu Kang and syntax, and also the guy that did celeb impersonations of Ozzy Osbourne and Bill Cosby talking about global television. V. funny.   8.00 pm  Doors open for the John Mayer concert! YAYYYYY!!   8.30 pm  Charlton Hill, an Aussie group sporting a cute front man perform. Really rocked the crowd. Not bad tunes - esp. the radio single, "Two's Company" (at least that's what I think the title is).   9.45 pm   JM comes on stage!!! YAY!!!!  It was a fantastic concert, and the crowd was good, rocking and rolling along. I must say a lot for his musicianship - he's pretty good at the guit., and his voice is great too. He's fabulous to see 'live' too  - interacted with the crowd and all. Overall, nice prep/rock look - he was wearing a shirt, which was drenched by the end of the night.  Hehe, we sneaked in an MD player and recorded the entire thing! Although I talked at a couple of instances. And sang along too. Eep. Hopefully my voice doesn't come out, so the recording doesn't turn into  "John Mayer in Melbourne - the Karaoke Version".  Charles read on his website that JM's actually fine with pple recording his performances, esp. since it's a good form of promotion. As long as $$ doesn't change hands. It's fine to let your friends have a copy and all. Now that, I think, is the right attitude to have. With all the hoo-haa over piracy and music and downloading MP3s and all, sometimes it's nice to have an artiste not being so  ngim-jim  over money. I mean, the record companies are having hernias over the whole piracy issue, mostly 'coz of the money they say they're losing. Get with the program - not making AS MUCH as you thought you would does NOT qualify as a loss. Most times they don't just break even, they have lotsa profits. Hello, Metallica?  Well, spending those few hours bouncing up and down was really fun, esp. since I got to share it with my 2 best friends in Melbourne, EG and Charles. We were standing in front of the speakers (oh my poor ears, I should have brought my ear plugs. They're still ringing now, more on the left ear though), @ the left side facing the stage. Irritated EG a lil' though, 'coz he was the designated photog. (he being tall and all), and I kept bugging him to take more photos. "How many shots of him singing do you want? One with every light change issit?" "No lah! But if can change angle also good lor. Maybe I should go the other side to take?" "Tell you what lah. I'll scan the photo and then flip it around for you ok?"  Hehe.  Highlight of the concert? I went home with a souvenir - a signature guitar pick that one of his roadies threw in my direction after the concert. Yippeee!  Next up, Emily of Emerald Hill on Thursday. And possibly Bic Runga next month. (I'm still lamenting the Jamiroquai concert though. Really wanted to get tix early on, but no one to go with! Finally found out Johanna's going, but she's got tix already, and they're seated ones, not general admission  - apparently the GA ones are sold out. BOOHOOOOOO).   11.50 pm  Walked out of HiFi Bar.   2.26 am  Just finished this Blog entry. Going to sleep now. Nitey nite, I've an interview in the morning.  29 October 2002

       I'm still here  In case everyone's wondering, I'm fine and no, I haven't flopped out of my goldfish bowl. Speaking of which, there's a new ad on TV right now featureing fishes swimming around a baby in his cot - for some sorta baby monitor by Fisher and Paykel I think. Not sure - if anyone has seen it, let me know.  It's essay crunch time again, which means I've been  piahing  or at least trying to  piah  for my essays, 1 due next Friday, and 3 due the following Friday. As you can tell, my days are packed and dreary, and I've gotten to know the Law Library pretty well, at least the section where I spend sitting on my butt and reading/typing.  On an upside, next week are the John Mayer and Emily of Emerald Hill performances. Quite excited for it. Yes, I know, strange that I'm going to see Ivan Heng in drag (once again) as everyone's favourite  bibik  in Melbourne, when I can see him in drag back home, but I think tix are much cheaper here - only paid $19 for an evening show. Plus the theatre's so close to home, I can walk there. I wanted to check out other shows as part of the Melbourne festival too, but unfortunately, with essays and all prob. don't have the time.  Am also on a job hunt for Nov/Dec/Jan summer hols. This Customer Service Rep. job sounded quite promising, and they pay $16 an hour, so that's good. But I gotta revamp my CV first though, 'coz I think I need to sound more dynamic in order to get the job, instead of just blah blah, I did this and that. I'm taking tips from this guy at the seek.com.au website too. Now I just have to get around to doing it b4 they close applications.  On an upnote, tomorrow me EG n charles are finally going to the IMAX theatre b4 our 3-month ticket expires. Such a waste of money if we don't get around to using it!  Anyways, I'll prob. write more interesting stuff next week. Not that my life is entirely very interesting anyways hehe.   Tata  Oh yes, btw on Chuckie's recommendation, check out   urlLink this guy . We're planning to do something like what he suggests, giving out useful items and maybe cookies during Christmas, to the homeless.

        Bel's B'day  I spent yesterday and today with Bel, celebrating her 22nd birthday. It was very enjoyable - yesterday we had a picnic at Fitzroy Gardens, with E-Gene. I got her a picnic lunch for her b'day (sigh, which I still feel is a kinda cheapo prezzie...) and also baked a cake. We had sandwiches, potato gems, crackers with kabana sausages and tasty cheese, herb and garlic cheese spread, strawberries and apples, and coke to wash it down. Throughly enjoyable, and the company was good :-)  Today we went to South Melbourne beach - took the tram down. We spent a couple of hours on the sand, talking about stuff, from relationships to people to school. Then had tea at a cafe and talked some more. Then had dinner with people from her church - mostly her housemate, Jean's friends, one of whom I found out much later was Wally's housemate! Wow...hehe. Dinner was fun, at this place called Malaya Inn in Doncaster - nice yummy food like  Or Jian  (fried oyster omelette), fish head curry, sambal kangkong etc. And even bowls of chicken soup! Mmmmm... It was followed by coffee at Brunetti's, which I hadn't been to since it's renovation. Didn't stay long though, 'coz Charles n EG came to pick me up soon, after their dinner and M1 concert.  The people I met today seemed really nice - would like to hang out more with them if I could. Nice to get to know new people. I'm also beginning to hang out more with a bunch of people from church, which is great (and a long time coming, considering I've been at ACCF for more than a year). Guess I'm finally fitting in and finally finding my place in the scheme of things - esp. 'coz of Alpha.  Btw, I've graduated from Alpha course on Wednesday, with my own certificate and everything! Alpha is sorta a back-to-basics course in Christianity, which EG and I attended, and after many months, finally finished it off reinforcing the knowledge we have, and making many new friends!  Anyways, back to today. I'd wanted to bring my camera and take lotsa pics, so that I could stick it into an album or collage for Bel to remember, but ARGHFFF!!! Forgot the camera!! Sigh...sad right? There goes a nice prezzie idea...  Chatting with Bel was nice. It's interesting how our friendship had evolved - I never really liked her from the start (which she tells me is what happens with practically every girl she meets - they automatically don't like her for some reason, so poor thing right? She says sometimes she acts a lil' bimbotic, just to seem more affable to people, 'coz she's naturally assertive. Me, I don't have that problem - I'm naturally bimbotic! heheheh). I didn't like her then 'coz I must admit I was a lil' intimidated by her, 'coz she's quite confident and assertive (and also very babe hehe, which I still think so), plus her manner wasn't very, I dunno, warm n friendly? A little aloof sometimes, and when she was friendly, she seemed superficial, and very PR. Plus we didn't have much in common to talk about too.   But we get along better now, and talk about stuff. She made a good point, that we should try to hang out when we're both in S'pore, or it'll seem like we just hang out with each other here and now 'coz we don't have any other close girlfriends here. Thinking about it, it's partly true though, 'coz Bel and I aren't exactly personality matches in a way - but that's 'coz our friendship is still progressing. Let me explain.  I personally think everyone has friendships with others on different levels. Like how I interact with people like say Charles, or Velle and Priyanca, is different how I interact with Bart, is different from how I interact with Bel, different from how I interact with my housemates, and different for EG (of course). With the first category, and also with my housemate Evie, I'm a lil' crazier and silly, and loonier . But when I'm with EG or Shawn, a lil' less loony and loud ('coz EG keeps telling me I'm too loud), with Bart I'm more affectionate, and with Bel I'm more sedate, 'coz we're still establishing our friendship, and haven't come to that super-comfortable point yet. I think the true litmus test will be to see her reaction to one of my Silly Songs! Then I'l know...hehehe

        My Mobile Phone...Literally (Part 2)   I walked slowly towards the tram stop... all the while feeling sad, and praying. "Oh Lord...help!"  Suddenly I stopped in my tracks. Waitaminit! Wait a minute! Before I left the lecture hall, I threw a plastic bag into the bin. Now it had made an unusually loud 'thunk' when it landed, which was why I picked it up again and looked at the contents of the bin. But I didn't see anything, so figured maybe a can or something just toppled over when I threw the plastic bag in.  That 'thunk' could've been my phone! As I recall, I was holding my phone in my right hand - I must have let it go along with the plastic bag!  Excitement bubbled up inside me. I ran for the security station again, praying in tongues all the while. Panting and out of breath, I knocked on the window. "Angelo! I..gasp..think...gasp...it could be in..gasp...hold on, I'm gasping too much..."  I explained my theory, and he just laughed good-naturedly. "Sarah! You're killing us!" He called Keith again, and I ran to meet him at the underground parking garage to walk back to the theatre.  We walked back in anticipation, as I apologised to Keith for making him walk back there again. I was telling God, "if I can find it, I'm just gonna say "Thank You Jesus!" and use this as testimony man! I was so sure...   We reached the theatre, and I ran for the bin. Pushing my sleeves up, I dug into the bin, which housed a few coffee cups, my KFC plastic bag, and used tissues. No phone.  But I knew I heard a 'thunk'! So I shifted the bin aside, and lo-and-behold, it was there!! Neatly resting against the wall, undamaged.  WOOPADEEDOOO PRAISE GOD!!  I jumped up and down in excitement, and even grabbed Keith's arm, shouting "Thank You, thank you!" He smiled, and said, "That's ok, as long as you don't make me come back here again!" I grinned back.  We walked out, and I kept thanking God. I suddenly remembered that I had promised to proclaim Jesus' name in this situation, and I'd forgotten to. Suddenly I felt nervous about it saying it out loud. I whispered loudly "Thank you Jesus." - don't know if Keith heard.  I realised I was being a chicken about it, so as we were walking I said, "Wow, that's amazing, I really thought I'd lost my phone!" Keith turned and nodded. "Yeah, it's really a MIRACLE that I found it, I mean, most people never find their phones! I really THANK GOD man. It's just so amazing. AMEN, amen!", I said, stressing on the erm...Christian-sounding words...  As we emerged from the shortcut through the carpark, I looked up at the sky, and suddenly everything seemed so beautiful to me. The trees, the damp ground, the cold air. I raised my hands a lil', and whispered "Thank You Lord."     EPILOGUE  I walked back towards the guard station with Keith. Before he left, I said thank you agian, and asked for his name, giving him mine as well - just in case we ever bumped into each other again around the campus. I walked up towards the guard window and waved at Angelo through the glass, holding my phone up for him to see. He smiled. (Praise God btw, that the bunch of us were the last few to leave - that way I knew who was locking up, and so could locate Angelo at the guard station.)  I boarded the tram, and thanked God once again for his blessings. I bumped into another friend on the tram, and shared my testimony with her .  Our God's really an awesome God!

        My Mobile Phone...literally   I walked towards the tram yesterday, as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky. It was about 6.40pm, and I'd just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with Jessie after lecture, while she waited for Tammy to finish class. I had a nice time, just having coffee and talking about school - Jessie's so easy to talk to.   Anyway, since it was pretty close to dinner time, I figured I'd better give EG a call n let him know I was on my way back. I reached into my jacket pocket...and found it empty!  "Arrrgh! Where could it be?" I checked my bag, rummaged through it. As the pit of my stomach started to swirl, my brain kicked in. "I probably left it in the lecture hall or something. Better go find the security guard who locked it." So i ran to the station, hoping to somehow locate the guard. He was there! Manning the station! Angelo was his name, a guy in his late 20s-30s, and he was kind (and friendly) enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre, which was right at the other end of campus.   So me and Keith, this tall man with a moustache, probably in his 40s, walked in the cold back towards the theatre. "Where else do you think it could be?"  "I don't know. The Baillieu Library probably..."  "Have you checked it?"  "No, not yet. Probably later."  We walked up the steps to the theatre. I walked in, and searched the area where I sat. No phone. He looked up and down the theatre steps too. No phone either.  "Sigh, it's ok, I'll check with the library. Thanks!" "Yep."  I walked back towards the library, where I'd gone with Jessie to zap lecture notes. I put on my jacket there, so I figured it must have slipped out then. I checked with the librarians and the lost-and-found counter there. No deal. I tried calling EG on the payphone, and Jon's house phone, but no one picked it up.  My heart dropped as I registered the fact I'd probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone. Money that I found hard to part with. All this while, I was begging the Lord "please, Lord, please...", yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone. People adhere to the finders-keepers mentality over here - I lost my sunnies a month back, and never saw it again. Let alone a phone!  I walked in dark back to the cafe where I had coffee with Jessie. It was probably closed though - it was already 7 plus. The ground was damp, the air cold. I shivered as my toes gripped my Birkie sandals. A light! People were still there! I knocked on the glass door. "We're closed!" said the girl on the inside. I knocked again. She gestured with her hands, that they were closed. "Hey John, there's someone at the door knocking!" she said in a nasal voice. John looked up. "I'm sorry, we're closed"  DUH, I knew that already.  "I'm sorry, but did you guys see a mobile phone in here?" I yelled through the glass door. "What?" "I said I think I left my phone in here!"  He opened the side door, and I explained myself. "Sorry, we just cleaned up, and didn't see anything." "Oh, it's ok" "I'll leave a note in the the cafe, in case I find anything, so you can check back tomorrow?" "Thanks."  I trudged on, towards the Student Union info desk, in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up. It was closed.   I scrounged through my bag again, then decided to return to the library to call someone. The only other number I had memorised was Charles', so I called him. "Charles!" I squawked, "I lost my phone!"  "Huh? How?" "Don't know lah. Must have dropped it somewhere. Do you have Chris' number? I'm trying to call pple at home but no one's picking up!" "Ok, hold on ah..."  He gave me the number, and I lamented how I'd have to buy a new phone. He offered to sell me his other phone, the one he had but wasn't using at the moment. I said see how, still praying that I might find it.  I tried calling my phone, in case the person who found it picked up. Or at least if it was switched off, at least I knew for sure it was gone and could move on. It rang. And rang...and rang. It was on vibrator mode though, so maybe whoever had it didn't hear it.  I retraced my steps again. No phone. I gave up.     tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of... My Mobile Phone...literally

        Why?    Why is it   that you can never repeat that fresh-from-salon look, even after spending hours adding mousse to your hair?  My hair looks more bobbish than sleek n funky. I don't know how the guy at the salon did it, with his creme and his scrunching fingers, but it looks weird now....sigh. Or maybe 'coz I'm trying to do it with bed-hair, and not freshly blown & washed hair. Whatever it is, I can't repeat the look. Sigh...sob.    Why is it  that even though your body is aching and tired, your mind is still awake so you just can't fall asleep?  I spent the other night in an insomniac stage, and ended up watching informercials. I am actually seriously considering buying one of the products, Winsor Pilates from the website! Hmmm...    Why is it  that even though I have things to do, like essays and such, I can never fully concentrate on them?  Instead I end up getting distracted by TV and the like. Oh there's the computer, oh, maybe I'm hungry...hmmm maybe I should go mend the hole in my t-shirt...    Why is it  that even though I have school later, and I haven't done my readings, and my stomach's rumbling 'coz I haven't had lunch, I'm still stuck here blogging, drawn like a moth to a flame?  Sigh...   In the words of that great poet, John Mayer, "Tell me why...why Georgia why?"

        Highlights of the Day    I streaked my hair RED!! And cut it short, till about chin-length. It was a very interesting experience at the hairdresser's, considering how it's actually a hair college - Pivot Point.   After months of looking longingly at the model on the poster at the salon, I finally did it. I love it actually...very vivid colour, and the cut's pretty good too. Everyone seems to think so (hehe), I got reviews from "wicked!" and "gorgeous!" to "don't go back to long hair in a hurry!" and "eh, quite nice ah, hor?"  Anyways, as I was saying, the hair college. This nice Korean lady, a student of course, cut me hair for me. It was an interesting experience 'coz she's only been in Australia for a year, so her English wasn't really good. We managed to communicate though. She reminded me of one of those Japanese housewives who you always see in those Jap soap dramas. I was talking to her, and found out she is graduating in December, and from there working at her mother-in-law's salon. Hmmm trying to impress the in-laws?  Well she was cutting it half-way, then her supervisor walked by, this tall hulking guy with bulging biceps, thick veins and a tight t-shirt. He took over for most of the haircut, showing her how to feather-cut my hair using a razor, an advance technique which she hadn't learnt yet. He did a pretty good job - looked nice n layered, and I think made my hair look a lil' finer. (*ahem* he also said I had great hair, and after the cut, he said I looked "unreal" heheh....oh the praises...). I quite liked it, esp. considering I was afraid to cut too short in case it didn't fit my face shape.  The Korean lady, Jung, was also noting details about my hair in a form as we went along - a pre-requisite for the college I suppose. Flipping through it, I found out my hair is in Good Condition, Porous, and my scalp is Normal (yay, the Selsun Blue 5 for dandruff works!). And all this considering I blow-dry my hair EVERYDAY!  And the price? Are you ready for this? For a wash, cut, half-head highlights, and blow-dry, it's only $55! Fifty-five bucks! Wooohoooo!   Now if only I can get the same results the next time I return to the salon...sigh it always happens. Great the first time, but they can't seem to repeat the same thing the next time round...  After the cut, I went to Priceline and got some hair products - a bottle each of this new Sunsilk Frutrience for Coloured Hair shampoo and conditioner (which also got me a FREE Frutrience cosmetics/vanity bag) and also Wella mousse-wax. I tried the mousse just now, but it didn't have as much hold as I'd like (wanna try some funky upturned flips at the edges of my hair), so I might pop down to Priceline again and get the Styling Mud.  Well, as for tomorrow, I'd better start on that essay that's due on Monday! EEps! And I'll be busy on Saturday afternoon and a lil' on Friday too!! EEK!

        Yummers   Had a very nice night today making really yummy strawberry yoghurt ice-cream. It's sitting in the freezer now, setting, and by tomorrow I should have a delightful dessert! Woopadeedoo!  That said, tomorrow also marks the beginning of essay work, 'coz I've an essay due on Monday. It's the Cont. Hollywood one, which I caught a lucky break - i.e turned out I had 2 extra weeks to do it. Eep. But have I spent the time wisely doing more research? No....Why? 'Coz I deserve a rest dammit! teeheehee...  Oh yes, went down to town today to alter 2 pairs of jeans. One was the Just Jeans one which I bought on Friday, the other a Sportsgirl one which I've been wearing a lil'  sua-ku-ly , i.e. with the hem folded up a huge chunk.   Did you know that alterations can be done and returned on the same day? I didn't! Thought I'd had to wait a couple of days 'coz of all the hemming and tailoring all these people must do. Well, as I found out, JJ has an in-house seamstress who does it on the spot. Unfortunately, she wasn't in today, so I left it to be collected tomorrow.  As for the Sportsgirl one, they send it out to be altered, to a place just across the road called Melbourne Central Tailoring. It was on the 1st Level of an office building, in a tiny little room at the corner. I almost thought I was on the wrong floor 'coz the lift doors opened to reveal a solicitor's office, with its tinted glass windows and couches. It was only after hearing voices from my left, and spying a small rack of blouses hanging near a door that I found the place, run by this really nice n friendly couple. The lady was talking to a Jeans West salesgirl (I figured JW also sent their jeans to be altered there...she was holding a couple of bags), so the man smiled and told me to hold on awhile. Real nice. And the price was right too! After calling several places earlier in the morning, I found out they were the cheapest, charging only $10 (yes, yes, please don't compare to Far East prices ok? If I were back home, I'd have gotten my grandma to do it for me for FREE - she was a seamstress after all). I'd have sent the Just Jeans pair to them too, except for the fact that JJ charges only $5.50 to do their own jeans, with a receipt of purchase of course.  All in all, am quite excited to collect them tomorrow. Yippee-kai-yay!

       Beautiful Collision  She was shy, and looked a little uncomfortable to be on stage for all to see. But her voice was beautiful, enchanting, ephemeral even, as the notes that rolled off her tongue disappeared into the air, like little bubbles of lilting melodies popping in the darkness. She was funny too.  "Is someone smoking pot in here?"  "Did you know that giraffes communicate with each other into ultra-low sonic frequencies? I just saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah, 'coz I thought for the last song there where it goes  (sings a low tune) , the giraffes could have done it well."   The band playing with her were pretty quirky and easy-going too, peppering the performance with comments and laughter. The group was fun to watch, and great to listen to - there was chemistry, and they seemed so relaxed and happy to be on stage, and were so totally devoid of the performance anxiety that grips most background musicians, who generally intensely focus on their playing and ignore the interaction-with-the-audience bit.  After the last song of the set (which was her hit single, Sway, from her debut album "Drive"), she mimed to the audience that this was the last song, she was going off stage, we were supposed to clap, yell encore, and then she would come out again - hehe, acknowledging the farce that are "last song" performances, 'coz there's ALWAYS an encore.  Confession: I teared when she sang "Drive" as part of her encore performance, 'coz, I dunno, it sounded so melancholic, and it reminded me of my sis and how she'd describe the drive-arounds she'd have with Ken, and then I thought of my sis and how I missed her, and I dunno, the whole general atmosphere I suppose. Sigh, whadda wuss I am...  I think I might end up liking her first album more - will go take a listen and see if I'm right.    Check out  urlLink Bic Runga  and her latest offering  Beautiful Collision .    29 November 2002

        Lock 'n Loll...   urlLink  Killing Heidi   ROCKED man! The gig was worth the 3 1/2 hour wait as 3 opening bands performed (KH came on at 11.55pm!!).  There we were, me and Debbie in the crowd up front as Charles, Jas and Kelly watched from an elevated step. Half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down, the other half bopping, and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness, while amidst all this stood two Asian girls head-banging their brains out, arms flailing about, looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing. It was WILD. And it was Awesome. And it was pretty short - only about 1 hr long. We wanted MORE!!!  The gig left us on a natural high - Debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze, scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light, while I just kept smiling and going "Wooohooo!!". A bunch of kookies we were. But we had SO much fun, and I haven't done this in a really long time, a couple of years in fact! So it was great to just let go at the gig, especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces. I'm sooooo glad I went, and sooooo glad that Debbie went too, to be my rockin' partner. 'Coz it's not really something you can do alone you know? You need a friend next to you, doing the same wild things, so you won't feel too insecure, even if there is a crowd of people around you. Two (banging) heads are a whole lot better than one!  Whatever it is, I highly recommend doing this. It's therapeutic. Let's lock 'n loll duuuuuuuudes!!

       Nice...  Had a nice day today, hanging out with Charles watching The Banger Sisters, and then having dinner and a date with EG.   I was bugging him after dinner to "be spontaneous" and to "go somewhere", like the beach or something. 'Coz we never really do anything like that, or go out on dates anymore - usually if it's just the 2 of us it's just running errands together or something. So yeah, had a nice time at St.Kilda Beach, and at the cafe at the end of the pier. We talked and laughed and joked around, and generally had a great time.   Anyways, major event. EG found my keys! We initially thot he'd lost it, and we'd have to cough up money to get a new one requested from the Body Corporate, 'coz it's a security key. But wot a miracle! See, he's been in and out of his car countless times since yesterday night, when he'd thought he'd lost it. He'd driven to church to search, to the post office, and today he drove to church, reparked the car etc. All in all, he was in the car MANY MANY times. And today, after work at the church office, there it was, lying on the seat, in broad daylight, as if someone had just placed it there! Freaky, no? Either someone had somehow gotten into his car, taken the key, made a copy or something, and placed it back there (without stealing the car or breaking any windows...), or a miracle was at work. Touched by an angel eh? They must've been watching.  In other news, got the Bic Runga CD, Beautiful Collision today at JB HiFi, for $18!! Can u imagine? I'd wanted to buy it earlier, so good thing I didn't. I was even in JB HiFi yesterday, but just bought the Killing Heidi album (which I'm really enjoying rite now), figuring since I had an online voucher I could use for the CD. That didn't work out, which was just as well, 'coz today was the start of the JB HiFi Christmas sale! Can anybody say woohooo?  *wooohooo* (echo...echo...echo....)  Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat's right...

       Music makes the people come together...  How would I describe by taste in music?  I say, eclectic. Or in other words,  rojak .  I never really listened to music, other than Christian Praise n Worship growing up, since I was living with parents who thought "rock music is not edifying to your soul. Why listen to all this trash when you can listen to something good?" Not quite "rock music is from the devil", though pretty close. But it does make a lotta sense in retrospect I guess.  After discovering that there was alternative Christian music (ie. same genres like rock, dance etc. but with Christian or more sanitised language), I was into that for awhile. Esp. since Jars of Clay was pretty cool.  Then it was Bossa Nova, and all that Jazz.  Now? I dunno. I listen to anything and everything. A bit of Killing Heidi, a little Diana Krall, some Foo Fighters, some John Mayer, a twist of Disco Montego, a dash of Bebel Gilberto and Jobim, some Cafe del Mar series.   Like I said, it's pretty rojak. After a long time trying to figure out my music tastes, I realised I can blend in as easily into a jazz lounge as I can in a mosh-pit (like this Sat. at the KH gig - phew, gonna get me some bruises). Woohooo! I shall not be typecast! I am a unique individual that subscribes to a blend of commercial music! hur hur...  Most underrated band? A New Zealand outfit called  urlLink  Eight  , who came down to S'pore a couple years back. I met the guys, and they were really really nice, and funny too (although a couple of the ones I knew have left since). Their music's really different, so if you get a chance to check 'em out, it'll be great. I personally can't really describe the music, or put it in any category. I call it weird-but-definitely-listenable. They call it rock.   And they're playing for Big Day Out in New Zealand next Jan too! kewl huh? Darn, too bad not in Oz, although NZ is a hop skip and jump away...hmmm...holiday?   PS. Happy Birthday Kenneth!!   21 November 2002

       Training again  Today's 5 hr shift was slow, but still cool. I made my first full coffee drinks, as in mailk and foam and all and served to customers. Mike, my boss, said I did a pretty good job, and the foam really turned out well, so I'm pretty happy! Yay! Favour Lord!  Learned to clean the machines too. Next week, I'll be doing the busy morning periods - 7.30-9.30am, where the orders just keep pouring in. Hooooo....it'll be tough...

       Training  It went really well, and the time just flew past. 3 hrs taken up in a whirl of coffee making and pounding. And there's more tomorrow. I can honestly say I'm really enjoying myself. It's was really fun, and not too stressful, 'coz the Queensberry n Lt. Bourke store isn't as bz as the rest of the GJs outlets in town.  In other news, my silly iron has broken down. Maybe the fact I'd dropped it accidentally from the ironing board has something to do with it. Maybe, just maybe. Whatever it is, it's gonna be hell to fix. Erp.  My cough and slight flu is still going on. All the honey drinks and gargling with Listerine doesn't seem to help. Dangnabbit!

       This post was brought to you by the letters B, H and G, and by the number 33  Arghf. It was a high of 33 degrees celsius today. I felt like I was back home in Singapore. Except, unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of entering my room to turn on the air-conditioning, because, well, golly gee, I don't have one!  It's sweltering, the heat is intoxicating, stifling, almost as if yr baking in an oven. Even the fan that rotates near your face does not provide a reprieve, except to blast dusty air into your stuffed right nostril (I've got a bit of the flu at the moment). Sigh.  So the nap I took in the afternoon, or rather evening  - woke up about 8pm (and there was still sunlight - I tell you...I'll never get used to this) - left me feeling groggy and more tired than I was before. I can only describe the feeling in one word: bleuuurghghhffffgg. I felt extremely bleuuurghghhffffgg.   And the next coupla days promise to be worse. It's rollercoasting up and down, from 23 tomorrow, to 33 the day after, to 19 the day after that, to 23 on Thursday again. Wah lau eh.... well, weather predictions change on a daily basis, so maybe it wouldn't be that bad.   I can only hope.

       Birthday Part Deaux  Yup, yesterday went well, although the picnic at the beach became a picnic behind the bathhouses 'coz the wind was so strong. It was nice and sunny at Mid Brighton Beach, but way too windy. Overall, it was fabulously delicious, I got some nice piccies of the colourful bathhouses that looked like they could only fit 2 human beings plus their pet turtles - ie. very squishy n small.  Oooh we went to Hunter Gatherer at Acland Street, St. Kilda and picked up a really nice skirt for about $19. Kewl eh? Charles says it makes me look like Jungle Girl, ah but what da hey, you only turn 23 once.   Sigh...23...soon it'll be 25, then 30. How life zooms past. Ever get the feeling?  Anyways, for dinner, EG brought me to this v. nice restaurant by the bay/beach in Williamstown, called Anchorage Restaurant. I had the Sirloin, he had the Eye fillet, even though that place was more of a seafood kinda joint. We ordered the only 2 steaks on the menu. By boy, delicious! And the company was good, although it strayed to topics like "Is it possible to make drunken fries? Or like flambe it or something...", to which we started enacting how we'd do it, like  (cup hands together)  here's a potato,  (jerk arm as if adding seasoning)  add wine, followed by  (flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette)  lighting it, and then  (move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom)  TA DAAA!!!"  10 mins later....  EG: "Hey, what are those?" Me: (Chewing a rather large piece of medium-rare steak...)  Cup hands together, jerk arm as if adding seasoning, flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette, move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom  EG: "Potatoes?" Me:  Excitedly pointing left index finger to nose, and right index finger to EG, nodding vigrously, cheeks full of food   The highlight?  EG: "Eh? You don't want the mushroom ah?" Me: "Mushroom? What mushroom?" EG: "Er...that." Me: "It's a mushroom? Oh my goodness! I thought it was a really burnt slice of potato! Like, flambe-d or something!"  Yes, my blonde roots were showing.  My parents called later, to wish me a Happy Birthday, as well as my sis this morning. Tho Thweet. And Bart too, half and hour ago (Note to Bart: It's OK!! I still love you! :-) )  How does it feel to turn 23? I really don't know. Ask me again the same day next year.

       Shameless Plug  It's my Birthday today! woohoo! Was born 23 years ago, at 1.41pm (GMT +8hrs - i.e.S'pore time).  So far I've gotten a really cool laptop backpack for my luverly iBook from EG, Charles and Wally, and very adorable Sabi underwear from Bel. It's blue striped with a goldfish in front - she was very excited about it hehe. (Although Charles insists it isn't a goldfish, it's just a fish that's orange-gold in colour. Looking at it, yeah, maybe, but me and Bel will insist it is a goldfish! For my (name)sake!)  We're going for a picnic at Brighton Beach later, and a nice dinner, just me n EG later tonight. Can't wait.   How we decided on Brighton Beach was really amazing! We were scratching our heads as to where to go for a nice picnic. So I thot, hmm, somwhere not too far out, but still away from the city. Maybe a beach, or the countryside. Figured, hey, we've passed Brighton beach a coupla times on our way to Ikea in Moorabin, why not give it a go? I still wasn't sure though...  Then EG came home, so I asked him, "Where should we go?"  "How about Brighton Beach?" I stared at him, while scrambling to find in my brain whether i'd mention the location to him earlier on the phone or icq or something. Nope-didn't.  "You're kidding! I thot of it too! Oh my gosh!" "Yeah, Shawn's been there once, siad it was pretty good." "Oh my gosh! It's a sign I tell you! I even asked Evie about it just now. Maybe God wants us to be there or something...heheh"  Hmm..maybe he does? We'll see. It's amazing how excited I get about the lil' things in life...very easily amused hehe...  Okely dokelies. Will let ya all know what happens next!

       The things she said...  "Did you know that how you hold your chopsticks means how far away your future partner is?"  "Did you know that you can eat the fish's bones? If they're fried enough."   (Qn: "Which part of Singapore are you from?")   "Oh, Singapore isn't very big, it's actually smaller than Victoria...we don't really have states."  Yes, yes, such are the pearls of wisdom that spewed from my mouth at an alarming rate at the staff meeting. I really hope people didn't leave thinking "god, that weird Chinese girl talks waaaay too much".  'Coz that's what I think I did. Left people with bits of information that they didn't really want to know. Sigh.  On the up side, I think overall it went pretty well. The other staff pple were nice, and so was the meal, at Kun Ming Restaurant at Lt. Bourke St. It's been there for ages apparently, and got a huge do-up recently, leaving it looking pretty posh. Other than my inanities, it was mostly coffee talk.  I don't think I'll get as many hours as I'd like to work, judging by the training schedule. So won't make as much I guess. But I have a good vibe about the job...the boss, the pple, the place, the uniforms (which me Boss has to re-order 'coz they were a lil' too big). They're also pretty strict about attire - no earrings, minimal jewellry etc. Oh wells, not that I have any outstanding piercings anyways...And praise God, the job's starting 1 week later than scheduled, on Dec 9, so that means I get to go Church Camp! Woopee! (woopee mostly 'coz I get to surf hehe....)  Anyways, those were the highlights. Hope things work out with colleagues! And I gotta study for a Gloria Jeans' exam regarding coffees and the machines etc. Lotsa things to do...and remember. Like "once a customer enters a store, how soon must you greet him/her?" Answer: within 8 seconds....oooohhhh.....  That's what I'm talking about...

       Bow down to the Red Dragon!...   To paraphrase Ray Fiennes. Just returned from the movie - it wasn't too bad, albeit a lil' predictable towards the end. Does anyone know if the ending was the same as the book? Kenneth believes its different - shan't say more or I'll be accused of being a 'spoiler'.  Anyways, just thot some areas could be developed more, like the relationship between Reba and Francis (aka Mr D. aka Red Dragon aka Psychotically Repressed And Emotionally Abused Serial Killer). Stellar performance from Mr. Hopkins . Wasn't much space for Edward Norton to strut his stuff though. Same goes for Ray Fiennes. Emily Watson was very convincing as Reba, the blinking kewpie doll.   That aside, I also went to Borders and almost bought a book - "White Teeth" by Zadie Smith (was it Smith?), although was stopped at the last minute by Shawn who said it sucked. He said he was willing to give me his copy, which was back in Singapore though. Damn...  I spent a good 20 mins trying to finish reading  the Glamour mag that I'd started the last time I was at Borders. At $11 a pop, I don't have the moola to spend on buying imported mags, so it's Border's free browsing for me. Never got to the last page, but did read an interesting article by Kristen Gore Schiff (Al and Tipper's daughter btw) regarding women, work and motherhood, and why can't women have it all without compromise. I'll prob. read it again, to relook at the fine points she brought up. Did you know that Australia and America are the only two developed countries which have UNPAID maternity leave? tsk tsk....UK has 18 days while Hungary has 24!  A couple months back there was a huge hoo-haa regarding a bill that a women's coalition was trying to pass, that they get to have up to 3 years maternity leave. Some said it wasn't economical to keep a woman at the company and have her retrained when she returned. Me? I'm not quite sure where my stand is, 'coz I don't enough about the properties of the bill, nor do I know how much maternity is enough, nor do I know what the so-called economic costs are. So, gotta find out so I can weigh out the costs, and see where I stand.  I do believe, however, that the company she works for should be supportive, and allow her enough time to spend with her child, and not penalise her in monetary terms. In short, motherhood/household maintenance etc. is work!   I wonder if anyone's written a thesis about the whole leave-the-nursing-to-the-maids issue in Asia. How does that affect a woman's stand and her power relations with men and other women? Other than the gender issue, it also becomes somewhat of a class issue too.  Any thots? Leave a bl00p!

        Would you like boobs with that?  I really really can't stand Jennifer Love Hewitt. Or else, intensely dislike, whichever way you take it.  Sitting here in front of the computer, listening to the whinge-rock that is "Bare Naked" for the gazillion-millionth to the power of Nth time, all I can think to myself is,  "god, I hate Jennifer Love Hewitt!". Or Intensely Dislike.  How can anyone not stand someone who tries to rip off another singer's moniker? For goodness sake, J.Love? Holy moly ron kenoly!  And the Party of Five days, and Can't Hardly Wait, and her bobbly breasts, and her puppy pouts.   Ask me about the Jennifer Love frown-pout the next time you bump into me.  Would you like boobs with that?          Ironically after I wrote this post, I got into Sue-Lee's car, and there, blaring on Nova 100, was, you guessed it thaaaat song. It was as if the planets had specifically aligned today, to add salt to my bare naked wound, to rub my nose into Jennifer Love's perky bosom, for daring to take her pouty highness' name in vain. Sigh...

       Epitaph  Picture a quiet graveyard in the long-distant future, with craggly grey stones, the smell of green green grass, the trees overhanging as the sun streams through in the fading twilight. You stroll among the chirping birds, the flittering dragonflies, the people walking their dogs amidst the calm serenity.    Then you stop at my tombstone, and etched into the granite are words of wisdom that will follow you eternally.    I CAN'T REPLY TO THAT BECAUSE I AM DEAD.   Aaahhh...a cryptic message from beyond the grave, yet quirky enough to embody my character, my nature, my innate...er...quirkiness.   Whatever you say,   I can't reply to that because I am dead .    (Had meant to write this entry for a while now, dunno why I forgot to. Ami's blog entry reminded me of it, not to bear any disrespect to her entry of course, hehe).

       At Last...  It's over. The whole bleedin' ordeal. The whole  shebang . Essay garble on dominant ideologies perpetuated via melodramatic forms on television such as the soap opera and even my fav. tv show of the moment,   24 , due to their associations with the domestic sphere and the lack of final resolution. Essay crap on how  Looking for Alibrandi  can be constituted as part of Italian National Cinema even though the entire film is set and shot in Sydney, Australia. Essay vomit on Omar Calabrese's ideas of television seriality and the five dominant prototypes. Essay blobs on the uses of comparative advertising. You get the idea.  I AM FREE!!!  At least for the next 3 months plus. Until it all starts again in March.  But in the meantime, I'm gonna enjoy my freedom. Oh what to do what to do...hmm, yes shopping of course! Especially since I GOT THE JOB!!!  Wooohooo, yes yes, it's just at the new Gloria Jean's outlet, a global franchisee of coffee in Melbourne, the heart of Australian coffee-making. As Shawn puts it, I've sold out. But what the 'ell. I've got a job that'll last through next semester (if things go well). Praise the Lord!   Austin Powers impersonation: Moola moola moola...   And, based on the fact that I'm turning 23 next week (*ahem ahem hint hint*), I'll be paid a higher wage than most others (it's Award Rates over here, so the older you are the higher the pay. Downside tho's that some pple won't hire you, knowing they have to fork out more). Even after tax (which I can claim back anyway), I'll still be taking back a pretty decent wage. Woohoo!  Well, they say good things come in threes. I'm just waiting for the third. Hmmmm....

       Have you ever?  I'm just wondering is it just me or does everyone sorta put on an accent when they speak with  ang mohs ?  After years of thinking such people as   le poseur , I've come to the conclusion that we can't help but do so as a natural human effort to communicate with others clearly. I.e. if we speak a lil' like 'em, they'll understand us a whole lot betta.  Case in point: A couple of weeks ago I was checking around for prices for belly-piercing - Bel wanted to give it a go, so I was sourcing for the costs. Ended up calling this guy, who turned out to be a pharmacist who did all sorta piercings for pple, along with his wife who was a doctor (hygiene!). I rang up, and somehow ended up with a twang as I spoke. This usually pops up when I'm a lil' nervous too - lapsing into my Valley girl mode.   Hi, I'm just wondering if you guys like, do belly-piercing?    Yep, we sure do.     Oh, how much does it cah-st?    Well, it's $75, but it's pretty cheap. You sound like you're from America.   Momentararily caught off-guard, I said the first thing that popped into my head to explain the accent.   Uh, yeah, I am.    Oh, which part?    Sawrry?    I mean where are you from?    Erm, America? But I'm in Melbourne now....    Oh, erm, er, that's all right, heh. I was trained in San Francisco myself, so I know that you're getting a good price here. Are you a Melbourne Uni student?     Erm yeah, I'm an...exchange student.    Well, Melbourne Uni students get a discount, so that's about (calculate calculate calculate) $63.    Oh cool, ok. Yeah so if I decide to make an appointment I'll ring you guys yeah? Thanksverymuchseeyabyebye.   Dooooot....doooooot....doooot......    Sheesh kabab.... If anyone else has done silly stuff like this, please let me know so I don't feel so alone in this world... ;-)  4 November 2002

        Emily of Emerald Hill  Impressions of the lady sitting 2 rows behind us:   Emily (played by Ivan Heng)  says something  Lady behind us : Mmmmmm.....  Emily  says something else  Lady behind us : Mmmmmm....  Emily  asks everyone if they know the recipe for Pineapple Tarts  Lady behind us : Pineapple, sugar, er, mmmmm......  It was excruciating.  Other than that, the play was hilarious and Ivan Heng was great as everyone's favourite Peranakan Bibik. Especially when Emily started interacting with the audience, and pulled this woman on stage as she was getting to her seat (she was late - thank God we got to the theatre just as they were closing the doors). Made her stand in the corner while everyone laughed, but the woman was laughing too, and enjoying herself. She was finally allowed to return to her seat though, after apologising to the 'class'.   Should've been the lady sitting behind me. Mmmmm......

       Does everybody know what time it is?  It's...tool time. No seriously, it's 4.30pm here and I haven't gotten started on the rest of my essays. I just wish everything'll get done soon. Essay time of course, also means that my room and bed got vacuumed, the toilet got scrubbed, and the hallway got vacuumed as well. Essay time = housework time. Oh the life of a procrastinator...  Btw,  urlLink dooce.com  is back! Hooray...haven't had time to run through the archives though, but the stuff I've read so far's pretty good as usual. Very Ami, but more acid and bite. (That's not too say that Ami's doesn't have bite...noooo....in fact, the girl literally bites. EG had her teeth imprints on his leg for awhile ;-) ).  I hate Daylight Savings time for the fact that I lose an hour in Spring. So last Sunday, spent turning my clock forward, I lamented over the fact that I have even less time to do my essays. Eurgh.  I should get back to work...Sigh...v.v.bored...

       Also...  Note to self: Never EVER EVER talk about toilet paper that scratches your bum, over the phone, while sitting on the steps in a semi-unladylike manner.  You never know who could walk by and listen in on the latter part of the conversation and not realise that you were talking about ways to save money.  That same person may also throw you a look that's a cross between disgust and confusion before rerouting their path past you.

       Altogether now...It's quite fun to be a Mamasan...  It's quite fun to be a Mamasan! It's quite fun to be a Mamasan!  Hehe, yep being the innkeeper at the Lucky Lucky Best Best Holiday Inn in Bethlehem has its advantages :-) Whatever it is, portraying a loud brusque  sampat  brothel owner at which the baby Jesus was born proved quite a risque performance at tonight's church Christmas dinner. But it went down pretty well, everyone laughed, and I kept having the aunties and uncles coming up to me and patting me on the back for being such a good actor heeeheee...although some people say it wasn't really acting, I was just being myself. I wonder what they meant by that...hmmm.... :-)  People laughed at unexpected bits too, and especially at the last part where I started coming on to one of the Three Wise Men. Speaking of which, their rendition of "Dancing Kings" to Abba's tune was an instant hit, coupled with Steven's portrayal of a not-so-wise man bumbling around in his jester hat. It was priceless, to say the least! Also spot-on was Uncle Jimmy's Angel Gabriel, complete with flapping arms substituting as wings, and a lab coat. "Remember Joseph, what Mary says is true, for women are ALWAYS right!! Ask the married men in the audience!"  Aaaah....the wisdom of an angel.  Special Mention goes to Emily's and Amy's graceful dance, who pulled in the serious note of the play. Sigh, it's just as well that I was  Mamasan and not one of the dancers lah - would've probably fallen flat on my face. Teetering on high heels are fine, but swishing and turning and curving around to a ballad? I'll leave that to the professionals.

       And the Results are...  Yippee, didn't do too badly for my essays, better than I expected, considering all the last minute work I did hehe. Praise God it all turned out fine...  Yesterday night was a movie marathon as I spent a couple hours under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, watching Y Tu Mama Tambien as part of the Moonlight Cinema festival. The festival runs for about 3 1/2 months till mid March, with screenings of shows like Grease, or Frida or My Big Fat Greek Wedding - basically an eclectic mix of shows, and even Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as the festival closer.  Following the nice picnic under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, EG and I joined Charles, Alan and Shawn watching double-o-seven on the big screen at 12.45 am - explosions and diamonds for everybody! I have to admit though, the film's storyline was slightly more interesting than the bland catch-me-if-you-can scenario played out in the last, what, 19 or 20 Bond flicks? This time, he's Renegade! (And the Lorenzo Lamas/ Robinson Crusoe look does become him somewhat, although, Pierce baby, you gotta work at those abs! I spy some double-o flab...)  Recommendations: Lying on a mat under a star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens accompanied by good food, hot chocolate, a blanket and a warm hug. Yumsss...

       Pedal to the Metal  Had my first driving lesson with EG today, at a quiet carpark in Kensington. It was awesome! Had lotsa fun, even though it took me awhile to get the hang out changing gears, releasing the clutch etc. EG said I did pretty well for my 1st lesson, and that I caught on quickly. Hehe - he's a real good teacher actually, encouraging and patient..awwww.....  So I could start all right. The only problem was stopping! Hahaha....took me a long while to get the hang of braking and coming to a gentle stop for some reason. In time...  In other news, I'm playing the mama-san of the inn where Mary and Joseph crash at for the night in our church's Christmas play, held next Saturday. Quite funny lah, me teetering around acting like a Cruella Deville / ham-sap middle-aged lady. I think my favourite line would be when I say to Joseph "Aiyoh...leng zai (handsome boy)..." and pinch his cheeks. (Either that or "Welcome to Mamasan's Lucky Lucky Best Best Holiday Inn! How can I halpchoo?")  EG's flying back next Sunday...we'll be seperated for about 6 weeks! I'll definitely miss him, n i think it's about the longest we'll be seperated for (or was the Hawaii stint longer?), though it'll also be good to have some time apart and regroup. :-)  How's everyone doing btw? (Yes, this means YOU, the reader of this fair blog...)

       Whoosh  Ever felt the rush of wind against your ears as you take hairpin turns at breakneck speed? Yep, just did it - paid 60 buckaroos to whirl around a go-kart track for 1 hour.  I left thinking, 'Man, I'm such a wuss!' and how I didn't get my money's worth for the 3 runs round the track (Australian Grand Prix rules), 'coz I didn't overtake and cut corners as much as I should've. Next time, I will. But dammit, I was afraid of crashing, and my arms were really tired from turning - really had to use my arm strength. Added to that I'd injured the middle finger on my right hand just minutes before the race playing air hockey. Sigh - the injuries from my go-karting expedition happened b4 the race'd even started!  But going at pedel-to-the-metal speed on the straightest part of the track was such a scary experience. Some people call it a speed rush; me, I call it time to pray. I think it was scary 'coz the turns came up too soon - didn't get to enjpy the speed of that stretch b4 having to tap the brakes and make the turn without skidding. And when someone crashed into me, boy was it painful - lurched forward in my seat.   I hate having other drivers really tagging close to me too - so I just give way. See? Whadda wuss haha.... :-) I guess that'll make me a semi-safe driver in real life (which reminds me, EG's supposed to teach me next week. Woohoo!) Anyways, I think I'll try the other track up in Sunshine soon - the Port Melbourne one, in a converted warehouse, just seems too small. Oh, and with a smaller group, so I don't have to keep slowing down when the amber lights start flashing 'coz someone's just crashed.

       Lord of the (Bathtub) Rings: The Two Showers  Congratulate me, people. Today is the inaugural start of taking two showers a day, a feat never before accomplished by yours truly since arriving in Melbourne. That's because the weather's always been pretty good. Even summer - balmy and warm.  Today, it was gluggy, and HOT. It's 1.24am now, and it's 30 degrees outside! EURK!!!! Dang forest fires and depleting ozone layer. Dang-hot-diggity-dog. It's HOT.   And it's worse tomorrow - 42 degrees!! I just wanna curl up and melt with the heat. But no, I shall press on, and leave the comfort of my home.... for the comfort of an air-conditioned shopping centre. I hope I find a good one.         Damn, it's hot.

       Intense  That was the expression on Eminem's face in 8 Mile. Either that or Intense-stoned. The only 2 expressions captured on camera thoughout the movie. Oh yeah, and when he gets pissed off - then that's Beat-the-shit-outta-you-Intense.     Phew!  The pic was pretty all right - very character-driven, although it tended to drag a bit. Parts I liked? The scene where he raps/sings to "Sweet Home Alabama", in his words of course. Also the touching couple of minutes when he's tucking his younger sis (or daughter? the movie's pretty vague about it) into bed and sings her to sleep. (Side note though; Emmy, baby, stick to da yo-ho-ho-rap n leave da singin' to da professionals, ya know what I'm sayin', bro?). Oh and the mandatory shag scene, I'd like to think, was thrown in for good measure just to prove a) he digs Britney Murphy's character, Alex,  b) to show how trite and meaningless sex is today, and c) just to please the bulk of the movie's audience made up of adolescents wanting to Be Like Em, who are up for some gratituous shots of flesh, esp. Murphy's (although let's not forget the scene where he flashes a piece of his lily-white ass to the audience as part of the Rap Battle Royale sequence at the end).  That said, with those intense close-ups of Emmy's face, I think he's actually kinda cute. Symmetrical features, piercing blue eyes. In fact, he could down right be a nice sweet ol' guy. He's a romantic, a passionate poet at heart, his melodic lyrics inspiring this shattered world to greater heights. Save for the parts where he wants to kill his ex-wife of course.

       There's no such thing as a free lunch  But for Charles there is! 'Coz he was sweet enough to drive me all the way to Ardeer, which is majorly far away (although taking the M1 and West Gate Fwy cut the driving time considerably). It was past Sunshine. If I were to travel by bus, it'd have taken me forever - just think of travelling from Pasir Ris to Jurong and back, and there's only ONE bus that goes that way.  And why was I doing in Ardeer (formerly known as Deer Park West) anyways? 'Coz I was there to pick up my mobile phone, which had accidentally slipped out of my bag in the bus that morning, and ended up in the hands of a lil' ol' lady who didn't even know what it was! She popped it into her bag, and when she finally picked up the phone after I'd rung it countless times upon discovering its disappearance, I was overcome with joy. Praise God. What a miracle. Considering the fact that she had no idea how to operate a mobile phone.  After a long while trying to figure out where she lived (her English wasn't very good - I think she's Italian), and after calling Charles countless times, and after rearranging my meeting with Bridget, I was finally off to Ardeer to meet this lovely angel who rescued my blood-line, my mobile phone. Where all my contacts (and the free pass-SMS to 'Chicago') were stored.   Mac opened the gate and returned the phone to me, to which I gave her an impulsive hug, so relieved I was. Phew. That's almost-losing my phone twice within a few months. I really have to get into the habit of looking behind me before I leave. Bugger.

       CNY just around the corner   Yep, it is. And I have many things to prepare for the church picnic that's going on then, on  chu er  specifically. Like source for goodies, and prepare flyers, and organise transportation. Many things to do!  But I guess it keeps me busy.  To my fiathful readers (yes, all 3 of you...), sorry I haven't been updating regularly, just been caught up with the daily grind of life (ironic seeing how Gloria Jean's slogan is "Escape the daily grind" - geddit? coffee? grind? oh never mind...). So as you can tell, the blog's been a little anorexic. That and coupled with the fact there's really nothing much happening in my life now...doodeedoodeedoo...  Let's see, maybe I should change my writing style. Instead of a journal-esque what-happened-today kinda report, maybe I should just deliver quirky excerpts, or at least working harder at putting a spin to the events that unfold daily.  How's this for a change?  "Driving...euphorically exciting, especially the feeling of controlling a revving machine under my feet. A small tap and it roars, a release and it stalls. Machinery built for ease, yet deadly in so many ways. Can't wait till the next lesson. I love driving."  Hmm...maybe I should just stick to my day job.

       Cruise Control  I had my first  paid  driving lesson today. Let's just say I'm starting with another instructor on Monday. 'Coz Sprint Driving School's instructor really sucks in the personality department.  He was this guy in his 30s, gruff, with curly hair, Nike sunglasses and Bunker shoes. Spoke with some pseudo-French accent, and was talking to me as if I were a small ant, nay, the food that ants eat. Harrumph.  So I'm going with Shawn's instructor. Was planning to do so, until he quoted me a slightly higher price - $27 for 45 mins, compared to Sprint's $25. So I figured, since Sprint's first lesson is $20, with a free one before the test, I'd just go for it, then decide. Sprint sucks. So I'll be meeting David and his late-model Toyota Corolla at the VicRds carpark on Monday.  Horns kept honking at me today as I took to the congested streets in the Southbank area. Never again! Eurgh... "Phress youhr brahkes, hwhy youh afrhaid of phressing yourh brahkes?...Tuhrn here tuhrn left here..." while nary a smile cracked his  kwali -face veneer. Sigh.  Hope the next lesson goes better.

       Bleepin' Fooo   *Parental Guidance advised. This post contains explicit language (which serves to highlight the reality of the situation).*  Today's rude awakening was brought to you by a scruffy pudgy jerk who wouldn't know his right hand from a can of VB if he didn't occasionally have to pick his nose.  There we were, standing on the curb waiting to cross the road like law-abiding pedestrians when a few jaywalkers crossed over to our side. Since there wasn't much room curbside with the crowd waiting for the lights to change, two of them had to squeeze past in the space between me and the shop that sold motorbikes on Elizabeth and A'Beckett.  The third brusqely shoved past me and bumped me aside, then had the audacity to blame me for not moving to accomodate his pudginess.  "Hey!" I said when I felt the push.   "Stupid fucking chink" he said at the same time, as he walked on.  I was stunned, then ranted to Shawn and Charles, "What an asshole!"  Shawn shouted to the guy's retreating back "Hey what's the matter with you?"  The Pudge turned around. "She didn't move outta the way."  "And that gives you the right to be rude? Have some manners, man" Shawn replied before turning around.  The Pudge advanced towards us enacting acts of bravado you see only on TV, spewing cliches less cornball than "you wanna piece o' me", and more cheesy than "bring it on". Something more akin to the Far East Plaza bengs' call-to-arms of "Settle!!" while flashing an orange comb with a pointy end.   Shawn turned around and faced him, once again reprimanding him for being rude, as the Pudge defended himself, eloquently stating "So what?"  "Hey, you were the one that bumped into me ok?" I said. I was ignored.  There they were, two male peacocks in all their fiery glory, fighting for a piece of lost pride, jaws squared, looking at each other straight in the eye, the space between them the width of two fingers.  And I was thinking, where am I in all of this? This isn't some bullshit attention-seeking rant that I'm spouting here, but seriously, if he had a problem, didn't he have it with me as well? After all, wasn't I the stupid fucking chink that got into his Royal Pudginess' way? Did I need Shawn to defend my honour like a frail damsel in distress? Do I need to reminded, even now, that I would have slunk away muttering angrily before the shock of it wore off and I realised I should have retaliated? Or maybe I would have just turned the other cheek, saying I shouldn't bother or sink to their level (and used it as an excuse to hide my fear as I'm wont to do sometimes)?  Shawn just reminded me of the time at Priceline when this skinny bleached blonde teen just stepped on my heels and when I exclaimed "Ow" she just told me to move my bags from the bench, and all I did was mutter "Bitch" UNDER MY BREATH. He says we shouldn't let people like this get away with it.  So what should I do? I don't just go quietly, which I used to do last time; now at least I show my disapproval at others' rudeness. But what about setting an example? WWJD? Dammit, sometimes I know what I can do, maybe shout back a cheerful "thank you for being so niiiice", and "God loves you"  (and also just to unnerve them), but a scathing comeback's so much easier to take on than love and peace or even a conciliatory nod of "whatever". And maybe I just DON'T want to be nice or submissive. Maybe I want to fight my own battles, and show that I can hold my own against the Rude Ones, men or women (but especially men).  As the brilliant plumage of the peacocks began to fold back, Shawn decided to turn around and walk off leaving the Pudge to continue ranting, "hey we can do this right now, man. Come on..." The Pudge just fudged his battle.  Charles asked what was it the guy had said that sparked the whole episode, and as Shawn replied, a young Aussie couple walking by us told us just to "ignore that jerk. He doesn't know what he's talking about and unfortunately some Australians are just idiots. Not all of us like that"   We smiled, "yeah, that's good to know. Thanks". They smiled back, kindred spirits for awhile.  It takes all kinds, doesn't it? But what do I know? I'm the Other - a  Woman  of  Asian  descent, a small speck in this (post-colonialist patriarchal) world. [Forgive me for indulging in that piece of arty-farty knowledge hehe]  If my primary five teacher Mrs Koh were here, she'd have given him a stern talking to, and washed his mouth out with Dynamo for using such filthy language. That's what we need to keep the streets clean. A stout middle-aged aunty who could hold her own against the young punks of today.   Try calling  her  a stupid effin' chink.    5 January 2003

       Counting Crows  Dan Vickrey thinks I'm cool!  At least my hair anyways, says the lead guitarist of a truly fantastic gig on Tuesday. Too bad my seats were really crap and far up, although we managed to slip into some closer ones. Woohoo! Awesome gig.  Dan also said he wore a red shirt in honour of my favourite colour - was wearing red birkies, had a red bag, and red-streaked hair. Yeah roight, like his shirt was really for my benefit... :-)  Sigh too bad my birkies broke at the concert, and the Mrs Potato Head keychained to my bag lost her white hat. Oh the woes of a concert -goer...

       Breathe again  I remember a shpiel I put up awhile back, which speaks infinite volumes about what I feel right now. It's my first shpiel in fact.  So now, once again, please rise for the encore performance of  Threat    This was it. She had no place to run, to hide. From beneath the folds of his trousers he produced his weapon, a shiny object that glinted and reflected the singular beam of light streaming through the window and THREATened her with it. Backed up against the wall, she had no choice but give in. She raised her hand as he slipped the object onto her finger, and accepted his marriage proposal...  Written by Sarah Wong, 4 June 2001    It's amazing how a year and a half on, your own words can come back to haunt you...

       Total Request Live  Yep..I know...many people are asking for a full description of what happened that fateful day - Saturday, the 15th of February 2003 (also incidentally the 15th day of the Lunar New Year -  Yuan Xiao Jie  or the Chinese Valentine's day).  I promise details will be forthcoming! Been a little busy lately, with work and social activities. Plus I've been repeating the story so often my mouth has gone dry. Am a little tired of the story already! Eep.  Soon soon....in the meantime, hang tight! And thanks for all the congratulatory messages - it's been great hearing from u guys and knowing you're sharing in our joy :-)

       Happy Birthday!!  That's what I should have said to the dear 6 year old kid who told me her birthday was yesterday. Instead I said, "Oh! Congratulations!!"  Sheesh! It must've been all the "congratulations" I'd been hearing all day, so much so I got my salutations mixed up. Eep. Every few moments, it'd be a person coming up to me at church, congratulating me, no, not for performing Herculean feats of magic, but for getting a proposal.  Yes dear Bl00p Bl00p readers, yes all 7 of u....I'M ENGAGED!!!  AHHHHHH!!!

       Hair again  It's more or less faded now, so it isn't that orangey. Unfortunately the streak that I like on the front seems to have faded too. Not as dashing!  EG's family have arrived and are doing well, holed up at Oakford Mews, off Commercial Rd in South Yarra. Really looks quite new, very poshy and nice, serviced-apartments.   And Ethan is soooo adorable! He's only a year and a half, and he's already speaking and READING! and COUNTING! He can count to a hundred! And in multiples of two! And read Chinese words. And he knows the names of the authors who wrote his books, like "Eric Hill" for his See Spot Run books etc. WOW. What a kid. And everytime he goes "Aunty Sarah, Read" I just melt. What a guy. Cute, intelligent, and he smells so nice. Yummers.  EG got his new maroon Holden Vectra today. Not bad. Hehee...can't wait till I get to drive it around...muahahah...  Yeah..I guess that's more or less what's been happening. Haven't had much of a chance to blog 'coz been busy. Haven't even been on the Net all that often either! I really wanna get away for a weekend though, just to recoup and feel like I've actually had a holiday/vacation this summer, before school starts. And it's starting in 3 weeks! EURGH. SO not lookign forward to it. But it's the last leg. Shouldn't be too bad...

       Hair today, gone tomorrow...  Hate my hair. Not the cut - love the cut. Just the colour. What was supposed to turn out as a pink block at the bottom of my wispyish chin-length bob turned into a chalky orangey-red mess.  And the best part was, I'd spent 1...2...3...4 and a half hours doing it!!!!!! Wah lau eh....  3 hours to bleach it, and it was still not white enough, but me and the stylist, a 17 year old sweet young student, decided we should just go ahead a try it. Then she had to mix up some colour 'coz they ran out of the one I wanted, and the teacher said the mix'll do. But combined with blondish hair, it came out less funky Pink and more Hong Kong Ah Lian.   What should I do now? Should I dye it all black (and maybe do a couple of red 20-minute streaks)? Or should I wait a week (as suggested by one of the supervisors) and bleach it again, then do the colour myself, using the Fudge range of semi-permanent colours?  Dammit....good thing it was only $32.10 for the cut and colour.

       Darn...  EG's return has been pushed back another week, 'coz of problems with his visa approval. Something to do with the need for a police check 'coz he's stayed in Australia before. What a hassle...and the Oz High Comm in S'pore isn't really helpful at all. Plus they employ really grumpy women to front their counters and be rude to people applying for visas aka my boyfriend. Must be all that power going to their heads. Harrumph..if I was there....

       Picnic  Wow, today's CNY picnic for church was a load off my mind. Praise God for the good weather, and everything went smoothly, and everyone had a good time. All the running around, blood, sweat and tears was worth it.  We had games - a group skits, CNY karaoke competition, and of course, a Lion Dance! Oh man, spent the whole night before sticking and layering the crepe paper onto cardboard boxes. Darn...what a waste.  If I had server space, I'd upload some photos so u guys can check out...but unfortunately...ah wells. But trust me, we had a lot of fun, and lots to eat, and everyone pretty much seemed to enjoy themselves, and we also had sparklers too! And lanterns...yes, even though lanterns are more for Mooncake/Lantern festival, but hey, it's still Chinese-y eh?  A funny story I heard today btw. A group of the people from church were in Chinatown, enjoying the festivities, when one of them got handed a booklet containing some facts and info about Asian businesses in Chinatown. She rejected it though, saying "I'm not Asian!" under her breath. Thing is, she's Chinese! But she doesn't consider herself one I suppose. A couple of Aussies there heard it too, then smiled.  I wonder, why do 2nd-generation Asians sometimes deny their heritage? It's a whole issue I've been reading about for class, the diasporic community in a new homeland, and how the kids adjust being part of both worlds. About 95% of the people in my church are Asians, a good number being Aussie-born Asians. I wonder how they really see themselves; most don't speak Mandarin, some occasionally follow their parents to visit relatives back home in S'pore or M'sia, and a lot don't know a large part of their cultural heritage. Few of the Asian-Aussies turned up for the CNY picnic today - most were the Intn'l students, and the adults.  I guess now I'm beginning to appreciate and value the education I had growing up, being forced to learn Mandarin for 11 years ('O' and 'AO'-level Chinese). Some of it really sticks to your brain yah? I guess if I end up settling down in a country where my Mother Tongue isn't widely spoken, or part of the curriculum, I'd also send my kids to Chinese School, just to learn a bit of their heritage, language and culture, something extremely important (and marketable!) in this global age.   They can thank me for it later.

       Back home  EG flew back yesterday to settle some visa stuff, and praise God, he's got it down n settled, and it lasts till March 31st 2005. Woohooo!  I called me mum yesterday to talk, and yet again it turned into another session contemplating her worry over my brothers' future. Seems like the older one's acting up again, understandable seeing how he's going through the teenage angst years, but he's more difficult than she's imagined it to be, and she's worried over the company he's been mixing with, who've recently been caught shoplifting. Stealing for the Winona Ryder-esque thrill of it. And we're talking about a pack of rich spoilt boys from his school here. Bored rich kids who don't understand the value of money, who bandy about their fathers' wealth like a troupe of marauding monkeys, sucking up innocents who wish they could be like them, like my brother. Maybe I'm being judgemental here, but I honestly don't care, just wish my bro would wise up. Sigh, the  financial situation back home is really taking a toll on everyone.  I'm hoping to apply for a bursary from school to help with living expenses, at least till I graduate. I missed the boat on the rent one, which subsidises about $60 a week, but hopefully  there are others I can apply for. It's no-strings-attached, so prayerfully, that'll work out somewhat, to alleviate the financial burden on my parents.   It's quite pathetic how I keep running to God only when I'm in trouble or worried, however understandle it is, being a part of human nature. Yet sometimes I wish I could find the passion I once had about church and reading his Word, yet am bogged down by the mundaneness of life such that I can't find a reason to, or more appropriately face the inertia of picking up my Bible to read and meditate.  Although I see myself reaching out some way, in my little human form, for that vast expanse that is 'spirituality' and 'passion for God' yet coming up short most times.   Is it the engagement of the topic however? Does the deliverer of the sermon exist to entertain or educate? We (and I say we in the broadest sense 'coz I think most of us tune out once in awhile) learn when we're receptive and humour creates such an environment. How much then, do we learn when we switch off or don't connect with the speaker sometimes? But beside the Sunday agenda, there's more work to do to, on a daily basis, building such a close relationship, which to be honest, makes me wish I could have a proper conversation with God - as in hear audibly and see physically. Are real relationships based on this? The seeing and hearing and touching and feeling? The tangibility of the other?  Ah wells...back to my little worm hole I guess...

       Numb  Today was a day spent waking up late, rushing to work at 7am (was supposed to be there at 6.30 only to be woken up by a piercing phone call at 6.45), rushing to school, going to bridge road, walking around hunting for a pair of good black shoes to wear to work and with jeans for winter 'coz the pair I'm wearing right now is literally falling apart, failing to do source said pair, going to Myer in the City, finding a good pair only to find out they'd sold out of the black one in my size (curse my status-quo size 7 feet), having the salesgirl call up all the Myer stores in Victoria, finally finding the LAST PAIR in the WHOLE of VICTORIA and thankfully not too far away, grateful for fiance for offering to drive me and my numb tired feet to Doncaster to pick it up, only to arrive at his office to sit about for one and a half hours waiting for said kind generous fiance to finish work and whisk me off to buy shoes.   Am still waiting.  Am also facing possibility that we might hang about Westfield Shopping Town in Doncaster for a bit, when all I want to do is go home, rest my tired aching feet and numb self, and watch a good night of sitcoms on Channel Seven. Oh curse late night suburban shopping centres....   Sleep...oh to sleep...perhaps to dream.   To paraphrase some famous person who said/wrote/sang that.    Bah Humbug.

       Lola-post-loser  What is wrong with the archiving system on this blog?!! For the countless many times I've tried republishing my posts and tried to put up the archives again, it won't let me!!!  But the posts are still around, thank God, 'coz I can access them in my "edit blog" mode, I just can't seem to link it up on my blog.   Can't the blog/Pyra people see this and help me? I mean, you've customised the banner ads to speak specifically to me, so I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING! What's up dudes? Can't you just show some tech support? I've followed your instructions in the FAQ section about republishing and how it's an indexing problem yada yada...and it's still not working!  Can someone out there reading this help me?

       Today  Today's the day we got the keys to our new place! It's all nice and wet and green. The carpets freshly steam cleaned and damp. My new room smaller than I imagined.  Today's the day that I found out I don't need an extension after all - the due date for the assignment has been extended for all.  Today is the day I have to frantically pack the remains of my belongings, and prepare for a new phase in my life.  Today is the day I leave Evie and Chris and Jon and Sturt Street and great public transport behind. And say hello to Kensington and mediocre public transport.  Today is the day I have to start reading for my Understanding Australian Media presentation on Thursday.  Today is the day I can watch 24 on TV instead of taping it. I have missed many many episodes...didn't bother watching the tapes.  Today, today today....

        Apologies  So here I am, facing a spectacular view  of Melbourne City, the sun reflecting a gold-yellow hue off parched walls and fresh concrete, perched on my comfy black office chair in the Law Library. A quiet spot this is. I really should be doing my work. Bah humbug - who really care's about Proppian narrative functions?  I'm sorry. Because you all can't enjoy this view with me right now.  So there they were, chatting and laughing and joking around, needlessly wasting time, indecisively deciding where to lunch. And there I was, waiting, playing watch-for-parking-attendants (which I hate), stressfully seeing the precious seconds tick by when I could be doing research, when I storm over in a cloud black debris.  I'm sorry. Because I was rude. Because I should control, not react, not express, but repress, and let it burn, and not take it out on you.  So there I was, thinking, culling worries, SARS, money, schoolwork, missing out on my brother's teenage years.  I'm sorry. Because I should be there for you guys, to watch and teach and motivate.  And here I am, sitting, facing a view, reading how I should write more.  I'm sorry. Should have entertained you earlier. But I'm back, at least for now, till my next disappearance.

I know it sounds patronising, but well, I am his older sis.  Sigh.  I hope he knows we love him.  Very much.  At all costs.

The theme's "Out of the Ocean" or something like that, heheh... it's really cool, I managed to scrounge up stuff last minute and put it all together. Used my red plum-coloured scarf as a pirate headscarf, and found a ribbon (in the exact same colour!) as my eye-patch. Matched it with one of my big hoop earrings (woohooo, finally a real use for it; Shawn's using the other one) and voila! Sarah the Pretty (sic) Princess Pirate!  As a prezzie, we got her a nice starfish pendant from Tiffany and Co., 'coz it's her 21st! Plus, she's leaving in July to go stay in the UK for a couple of months...sigh am really gonna miss her.  Miri, I'd just like to say, I Love You! :-)

        A Tribute to my Father  I will always remember my dad as a strong man, with shoulders broad enough for six-year-old me to perch on; he with the round tummy, a twitch in his moustache, and a twinkle in his eye.  I remember the times us kids spent in the queen-sized bed he shared with Mum, playing "I Spy with my Little Eye" as he picked out easy items within plain sight, while we picked out items that couldn't possibly be hard to guess, yet he humoured us, and tried multiple times before we laughingly yelled out "No Pa! It's the TV lah!"  I remember how he used to purse his lips together whenever he got mad, a stern warning to stop being naughty before he brandished the dreaded cane. But I also remember how he restrained from lashing out when he saw my terrible A-level results, and how he tolerated my first serious boyfriend even though he knew that guy was never right for me. And how he embraced the next, now my fiance, into the warm folds of our family.  For all this, I say, Thank You Dad, for being the head of our household, for being inspiring and uplifting, for being the earthly image of our Father up above. Thank you for caring, thank you for loving, and thank you for leading me in my life. God bless, and I love you.

It's nice to see that despite 54 years of life spent on this world, he remains refreshingly innocent.  It's more than I can say for myself heh.

       Yo de lay hey hoooo   I wonder how many people actually still read my blog? I know I haven't been blogging much, so to calculate, I would have to say it's the number of people who actually know about this blog, coupled with the trajectory of minute comet fragments floating down from space after burning up in the atmosphere, multiplied by the incessant number of phone calls answered in the cinema by a loud "ah, an zua? watching movie lah", divided by the intensity of Fear Factor contestants' projectile vomit after searching for objects in a tank full of live maggots WITH THEIR MOUTHS, which brings me to a grand total of...two, yes TWO people who read this blog regularly besides me.  Thank you, Charles and Tessa, who've left messages on my TagBoard. I will never forget this. Never.  As for the rest of the lot of you, may a thousand fleas from a camel's bottom infest your armpits!

Yup, and word has spread among them that I'm getting married soon, so that was pretty quick.  All in all, it was pretty fun, shooting the breeze, catching up with mentors I haven't seen in yonks. Ziggy's the same, so's Des and Robin and Yi Ling. Wanted to catch up with Mrs Yeoh, but she was on course. Maybe I'll just pop by again another day.

       My High School Reunion  Am meeting a couple of former classmates from my JC days. My goodness, I haven't seen them in ages. In like, 6 years! I'm not sure whether to feel nervous or just plain old....  That said, tomorrow nite at Embargo should be a good one. I haven't been there, mostly 'coz I've been away of course, and I'm not exactly the type you see raving up the clubbing scene.   So tell me, is it all right to feel that slight wee bit nervous at impressing former classmates whom you want to think that you are  a) beautiful b) witty and intelligent c) thin?  I think c) is pretty much cancelled out here. I'll try to work on the first two. Surgery anyone?

       Am blogging 'coz Charles says I have to be faithful to my audience  Settling into a new role at work is a real challenge. I feel lost, often directionless when it comes to this new project. But it's wonderful at the same time, to have a job in such a dynamic, yet nurturing environment, that allows you to breathe life into and concentrate on your walk with God. Such a privilege - and I'm getting paid for it too! Yay!!!  It really brings home the lesson "I'm Strong in your Weaknesses" (to paraphrase the verse). Praise God - He's been so good to me. I pray for inspiration, wisdom and guidance, and the discipline to carry my ideals through.   Is the world ready for the new Global Advance Network Coordinator?

       Gagh  Am currently traumatised because:  1. I just saw a horrible Photoshop-ped picture of a breast that supposedly belongs to an anthropologist who's returned from Africa and contracted some sorta rash. Her nipple had a couple of holes in it with squirming larvae. 'Nuff said.   2. I was driving along Bukit Timah Road and was about to turn into a lane when my dad suddenly  grabbed ahold of the steering wheel  from the passenger seat 'coz he wanted me to go straight on instead. I nearly ended up in the ditch!! (NEVER EVER do that to the driver, not least an inexperienced one!!)  3. I'm returning to Melbourne tomorrow to start a new career.

       Another 'ilarious encounter  Here's an excerpt from an email from my mum, who'd quote-unquote "nearly 'pengsan' laughing after reading the grapefruit account (Sat 25 October's post):  ------------------------------------------------------- Hi Sweeties,   Read Sarah's blog linked to Bart's blog on the Grapefruit episode, I nearly 'peng-san' laughing.  Good fun for the week.   Maybe share with you this one just heard from a visiting pastor from Malaysia.   Pastor Gan from Malaysia shared that some years back, he offered his home to shelter a village girl from Ipoh, who was an orphan.  One day, she had some food particles stuck between her teeth and asked this pastor friend of mine what to do.  Pastor Gan offered her a string of dental floss and taught her how to do it.  She went into the bathroom and didn't come out till quite some time.  Pastor then asked her did she floss out the food particle and she said yes.  Then, handed the dental floss string back to Pastor and said "I washed it many times already.  Return to you."  hahahhahaha...some ulu kampong girl....  Mummy....  -----------------------------------------------------   Disclaimer: "ulu kampong girl" is not descriptive of all girls from Ipoh, nor the greater area of Western Malaysia...

       Kaploink  Just some random thoughts  1. Congrats to Karen and Jon, for entering a period of courtship!! May God bless you in this journey of discovery together! 2. Terence and Brenda have decided to name their son Joel Ong Li En!! (and mind you, it's 'Jo-EL' not 'Jo'll'. El as in Hebrew for 'son'. In which case, shouldn't he be named 'Ter-El' or 'Bren-El' ?) 3. Feeling bloaty. I pity the people around me when the gas gets expelled, one way or another... 4. Living the righteous life, dying to self, living and serving the one true living God...... is DAMN hard!!! (pardon my french). And tho' I know it's worth it, the turmoil of making conscious right choices has turned my world upside down, on end. We're not called to lead the easy life, we're called for greater things, to be dynamic infusions that pervade humanistic, hedonistic society...to Live. And sometimes I just want to crawl under a rock and give in to the tempations that rock my world, that provide relief and not rest. To not think and just carry on in the doing of things.   Ay Caramba!  In other news, check out  urlLink this site . Conservatives, mind your manners.

       Halp...  There are just some days when you come off feeling inadequate, and often times, insignificant. Tuesdays are those for me, often times 'coz the Exec. team meetings are long and arduous, and whatever little I contribute seem of even lesser importance.   But that's just today. Most times, it's pretty all right, it's just that being surrounded by thinkers and visionaries and perpetuators of God's kingdom is pretty intimidating. Plus the fact that it starts at 8.30 in the morning and coupled with the sore lack of sleep the previous night for goodness-knows-what reason.  Sometimes I question my calling in this ministry, this field. Where do I truly fit in, in all of this, in the ever-changing environment that I've been planted in? A lot of issues on self-worth and -centredness get thrown up in the mix, and I have to keep reminding myself that there's a greater purpose involved and at stake. To be honest, the sore lack of sitting down and meditating on his Word and doing my devotions is probably a key cause of this. Need discipline!!  Ah wells, just a bit of a whinge s'all.

       Friends and friend-sters alike  I'm currently hooked on this whole  urlLink Friendster  business, and am unearthing friends and acquaintances from eons ago.  It's like Six Degrees of Seperation gone mad!  Currently, with my personal direct network of 23 friends, I'm linked to more than 140 000 people! How bizarre is that?  Although, I'd have to say, a friend did make a pertinent point. How many REAL friends have we made thru' this crazy machination? Or are we just content finding long-lost friends? Or is it the fun of bragging rights (hey, i have 245 friends and you only have 18!! How pathetic are  you ?)  So far the experience has been interesting. Hooking up and messaging ex-classmates and realising they know people whom I know too. Like a primary school mate who's  urlLink my sis'  colleague at SPH, and also a good friend's girlfriend's brother's girlfriend.   Oh, you get the picture.

       Jesus (Pop) Freak...  Came across  urlLink this article  via  urlLink Winnie's  xanga blog, and a whole lotta questions ran through my mind.  It throws up a lot of issues to do with the convergence of religion with mainstream pop culture, and the harkening of "being the salt and light of the world" - to influence (rather than be influenced). In this case, who's influencing whom? Mass media or Christianity? Are we merely using whatever means necessary to reach today's jaded youth? To "reclaim" popular culture? Or has popular culture claimed us? Is usurping pop culture a means to an end? But to what extent? Has it become a turn-off? Jesus can be cool, and he sure can be radical. But so what?  Any thoughts?

       I feel it in my fingers...I feel it in my toes...  So sings glam-rock bad-boy has-been 'Billy Mack' in the opening sequence of "Love Actually".  And he sings it so, so well - the ol' geezer, gyrating to the rhythm. But he's not the only one to gyrate (or vibrate, or translate, or prostrate) in the movie, no. For 'tis the season to be jolly, and Love, Actually, packs a punch!  The movie was hilarious! Tho' the plot intricately weaving through various (love)-lives was predictably naff, understated British humour never ceases to make me laugh till my belly aches. I'd expect nothing less from Richard Curtis, the man who brought us Bridget Jones' Diary, Mr Bean, and the Black Adder series. (And yes, Rowan Atkinson does make a couple appearances).  Truth be told, the movie should really be titled "Lust Actually", or "Luff Actually". It charts the fluff-luff lives of several characters in present-day Christmas season London. It's love-at-first-sight. Or love-and-sex-at-second-sight. And where it comes close to the true meaning of Love -  choosing  to love, each day, again and again, despite mistakes and close encounters with infidelity - it shies away, preferring to gloss over its painful reality in favour of the "sweet pure agony of being  in  love".  One of the perks the movie offers is the fact that you'd recognise most of the faces in the movie, including Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth (Bridget Jones'), Alan Rickman (the bad dude in Harry Potter), Kiera Knightley (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean) and Hugh Grant as  (can you believe it?)  the British Prime Minister!!   Like i said, it was hilarious!  (Although I must say, Mr Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral can still charm the ladies with his foppish yet debonair ways...)  Look out for the cameos!

       Ponder  I've just finished a book by Francine Rivers called "And the Shofar Blew". It's a very real, telling, tale of the lives lead by a Pastor and his wife, called to serve a local community when the church's pastor retires. The book weaves intricately, and into depth, of the anguish the wife faces as her marriage disintegrates while her husband presses forward in building his ministry, into growing a church that he hopes would please his dad, the respected leader of a well-known mega-church.  It's not a plot-driven book. The climax is almost predictable, and the pace tends to dawdle at times. But the attention to emotional detail is amazing, and you feel and cry and smile as the characters do, while facing their daily demons.   I expected to turn the last page and sigh with a breath of contentment, of longing, that the journey I'd begun had ended all too shortly. But surprisingly, it left me cold. A cool splash to wake me up, to alert me to the dangers of ambition getting in the way of ministry, of being blinded by personal goals with no regard for wise counsel. Are we building projects too fast, steamrolling whatever (or whoever) gets in the way of progress? Am I constantly listening to the Spirit's guidance? Is this what the Lord wants? These questions were whirring through my head as I finished the last chapter.  And I have no answers. Not yet anyways. And I'm glad for reading that book - not just due to its entertainment factor - but for the fact that it got me thinking. And to dwell on thoughts that challenge my approach to ministry, my calling (which may throw doubts in the face of faith - always an unpopular approach). To think of what I'm doing, and how it ties in with the Purpose of My life, and to think about why I choose to do what I do; why I work on the projects I do right now; whether I'm going along with the flow 'coz it's my job; do I truly believe what I say I should believe in for 2004?  Questions questions questions.   It's good, I think. At least I'm thinking, and not following along like a blind herded sheep. The answers, I believe, lie somewhere along the lines of dying to my Self - the Self that's lazy, unmotivated, procrastinating, happy to coast along with whatever life throws at me. And I  know  that's not how life should be; rolling with the punches, drifting from pleasure to pain and back again. There's more!  Wake up Sparky!!

       Mother  My mum's coming on Monday morning! Yippeeee! Till the 18th, after my graduation.  In other news...really wondering if the journey to marriage is worth it. Sigh, the ups and downs of coupledome....sometimes i just wanna give in to my animalistic instinct and be self-indulgent. Be all drama-mama and fling something against the fall - usually the ring on my finger. Like some movie/soap opera.  Don't worry peeps. It's all in my head...just a bit of a whinge in the valley-lull of my life. I realise I whinge more on my blog rather than expound on the good things happening in my life. Hmmm..  Really feeling the change in taking an active role of leadership in the church. Even friends have pointed it out, although a part of me is still reluctant to accept that I have changed, and for the better too. I'm more passionate, more vocal, feeling the zest to be close to God. (Yet strangely hypocritical 'coz I havent' been reading my Bible or spending time praying as much as I should. And it's not for anyone's, or God's sake that I do it mind you, it's really for my own. Tsk...the angst of procrastination....)  To wit, I say, onward Christian soldier!

       A little birdie told me...  Here's an email from my mum. Enjoy.   "Hi girls, Tell you something funny.....  Last Saturday, invited some old friends for CNY dinner including Egene's parents, Uncle Thomsas & Aunty Rosemary.  Half way thru dinner, I tried to switch on the TV to watch the Chingay Procession 'live' but can't get it.  I was asking them "Hey, Chingay what time huh?"  Then, Uncle Tom and Auntie Rose started to look at their watches to tell me the current time.   One old friend shouted "Oi, you asking your 'chingay' what is the time or you asking "what time will be chingay be on?"    Then I realise Egene's parents thought I was calling to them as "ching-gay" in Hokkien, which means 'in-laws'.  hahahah so funny...... Luv, MUm"   All I can say is, OH... MY... GAWD.....

       Hi there   I know I should post something up, but am not quite sure what to say. Heh.  Post post blah blah blah....  So a quick recap:  1. Just returned from a whirlwind tour of Bangkok & Koh Samui, and HOME sweet HOME! 2. Now back in Melbourne, freezing in our cold "summer" weather. 3. Over-indulged in CNY goodies over the past couple of weeks.  4. Gained extra kilos 'coz of said CNY goodies. 5. Does anyone know how to make  more  CNY goodies? 6. New roles at job. :) 7. Just watched Honey - am inspired once again (though not by the stilted acting) to "shake my tailfeather". 8. Thinking of taking dance class so I "booty to the beat, 'yo" like Jessica Alba in Honey (and to lose said CNY kilos). 9. Thinking of volunteering at local campus radio station to "get back into the game". 10. Should really stop annoying habit of speaking in "quotation marks".  Also, I confess, in my MTV-fuelled madness while back home, I bought "In The Zone" (simply because  I can  and  I like her ok? ). Needless to say, my friends have disowned me, my brothers loathe me, and my pet fish and I are no longer on speaking terms.  Sigh.   ;)

       Comparative Natures  Right after I blogged the last post, I took it upon myself to visit other bloggers' blogs - mostly friends from church.   Boy oh boy, have I got a lot of catching up to do, especially with this bunch of eloquent peeps we have. And all emerging from the woodork! They have a knack of turning the terribly mundane to something far more interesting! Very much like how my sis does, with  urlLink her blog  , which btw, is still one of my all-time fav. blog reads. Hmm, doesn't  quite  run in the family, if you know what I mean...  Ah wells, back to work! Seeya in a while.

       A Trip Down Memory Lane  Taking my own advice, I revisited the posts I'd written when I first started. I just realised I've been with Blogger for almost exactly TWO WHOLE YEARS now!!! Can ya believe it? hehehe....  Reading the trials and tribulations of uni life brought a smile to my lips teehee. And reminded me of the anguish of assignments etc, and having my  sacre bleau!!  iBook damaged. Those were the days.  Thankfully Azalea, my trusty iBook has served me well in the last 3 years. Only the battery's shot, 'coz of the 'overcharging' I did to her. Basically, Azalea functions more as a desktop rather than a laptop nowadays...but she's still pretty!  I think the new look has really inspired me to blog/write/journal again! It's amazing what a little greenery can do to jumpstart a floundering writing career!  Ok, ok. I reeeeeally need to go sleep now.  urlLink Alex  my man, I hear ya. Blogging is highly addictive, especially when one should be doing something else...

       Stay tuned  Just wanna let y'all know that the next verse of my silly song "Wilbur" has been created! In a space of only 15 minutes at Mark Teo's b'day dinner/bunch time, in between the meal and cake-cutting (it was a challenge by the fellow bunch members) last week! *pat pat pat on the back* haha...  Am v. excited. Have gotten good reviews so far, and it's even inspired a cabaret-style performance idea, with life-sized props to illustrate the story, with Ellen (Philpott) and assorted backup singers/dancers in shiny costumes bobbing up and down, holding top hats and canes! Very showy, but what would you expect from a song to the tune of Copacabana?!  Imagine...a darkened theatre, a solitary spotlight focussed onstage, where a lone figure sits on a barstool, her head bowed down, capped by a black fedora. The tune plays over the sound system, and on cue, I pop my head up and start singing, softly at first, then louder and louder and joined in by the bopping chorus behind me, while the dancers carry the life-sized illustrations as they prance about on stage as the sounds cultimates to its dramatic climax and..and...and...  Phew!! Gotta get my head outta the clouds....

       Hellos agains  I have so much to get done before the week/day's up, especially in terms of the Annual Dinner that I'm planning that's coming up. So much to get done! And so many people to liaise with.  Sometimes, I wonder if it's just easier to  NOT  work with people, especially when u have to push, cajole, beg to ask them to get things done. I hate doing it, hate being the middleman. I want the Vision to inspire people enough that they're clamouring to get it done, to support what we're planning, but those darn  exams  just get in the way!!  Planning a wedding, on the flipside, seems to generate much more excitement. Most people ar ecstatic to be invited to be part of the intimate undertakings of planning a wedding! And I fully understand why - it's like being a part of a secret sorority that creates something beautiful, and once-in-a-lifetime chance! And I'm so terribly honoured and grateful that my friends have jumped at the chance to assist and be a part of something that holds so much meaning to me.   I guess I just wish that that sort of excitement could be generated in everything I need help to do! Is it really how well I have to cast a Vision that'll inspire others to move out of their comfort zones? Sometimes even I don't want to move out of the zone myself, to do above and beyond what's just required of me. I mean it's not like I need/want others to do the tasks - but really the sense of delegation-as-empowerment. As in "teach them how to fish, and they can fish for a lifetime", that kinda philosophy! (But of course, there are instances where my skills are sorely deprived in departments of creative design, graphics and layout, and I have to depend on others.)  As you can tell I'm ranting. Lord, I ask for wisdom and strength and calmness in times like these! Teach me to be more like you! Less Self, more You!!  Father, I need your supreme wisdom, patience and kindness to fill my every thought and deed. Let me not be so tired that I forget how to see others as images of You!

       Just  what  are collared greens??!!  Tonight was spent, quite lovely in fact, in the presence of like individuals who enjoy the oftentimes eccentric humour shared intrinsically. Yes, we're all kooks. That's why our bunch's called "Out of the Box".  That aside, it was pretty fun to revisit the Veggietales "King George and the Ducky",not least Larry's silly song on Barbara Manatee. BUt mostly, it was the time spent after that we engaged with the creative side of our minds as we prepared for our song-and-dance bunch item for the upcoming annual dinner.  In the words of Bob the Tomato, "have we got a show for you!!"  Suffice to say, we're ripping off showtunes and putting our own words in it. They're songs that kids would appreciate I presume, not least for the fact they're composed by a bunch of adults with very kid-like mentalities. I can imagine the spiel: "Bible characters come to life in this charming stage rendition of stories like you've never heard them before!" Cue spotlight as the cast emerges.  I'm lovin' it!

       Brrr...it's cold in here...there must be some Torros in the atmosphere...  It's officially the start of Winter, and the chills are setting in.  Surprisingly though, today was still pretty warm. I guess 'coz it's only the 9th day of winter. Which also marks the 9th month mark of my term as an Intern at ACCF!!  (applause applause)   Today's BIG QUESTION:  What does it mean to live a life that's  adventurously expectant ?   Romans 8:15 [MSG]: The resurrection life you received from God is not a timid, grave-tending life. It's adventurously expectant, greeting God with a childlike, "what's next, Papa"?   I guess for me, a life that's lived adventurously is one that's on the edge (however cliche that sounds!), built in faith. Expectancy calls for faith, calls for living beyond what we can see and often times beyond our means or capabilities. Adventurously - that's a call to be daring, to leave our comfort zones.  So today, I shall begin like this: I adventurously expect...  Post your adventurous expectancies, people! (in the comments section)

       Dissociative Identity Disorder aka Multiple Personality Disorder aka (only by popular usage) Schizophrenia   A word can trigger off many emotions, and the consequent turmoil as the mind and spirit tries to grasp one that befits the occasion is...well...confusing. It's like playing word association, where each phrase conjures up an expanse of images and feelings and heightened senses.    These are the words for me: Aunty Yvonne CNY Angpow Chicken Wings Wedding Funeral Life Support Heart Lung Breath Cancer Crash Distant Close Love Home Tim Danny Adeline Daisy Telok Blangah Short hair Maternal Peace Heaven Love  I wonder if any of these memories are simply confabulations, stop-gaps to create a sense of connection, like I'm grasping bits of straw that inevitably slip through my weak fingers.   I don't know what to feel, and I'd gather most in my situation wouldn't as well. Sad, yes but yet, at times, not really. It's only when triggers appear, or when I'm not distracted by something else, work, people, church. Like I'm trying every emotion in the spectrum for size, to see how it fits. Do I grieve? Yes I guess, where the wracking sobs appear inexplicably, but not very long each time, and anyways, just what are the rules for the mourning process? So new, this is. So very new.  I wonder if my Grandma realises what's happened. And I wonder what that would trigger in her too - will she babble and smile, and greet familiar faces at the wake, not comprehending its significance? Or worse, understand the full painful  measure of the loss of a child?  Too many thoughts to ponder...

       Embarking  In about an hour's time I'll be on my way to Flinders, in the Mornington Peninsula area for an overnight camp/retreat/intensive with the rest of the community. We're going to be Equipped in tools, teaching, and the bonds of friendship, this Weekend, to carry us through the tide and turmoil of an everchanging world.  I got a frantic SMS from my mum today, read it disbelievingly, then called her back immediately, only to hear the distress in her voice. She sounded like she'd be crying, and rightly so I suppose. We just found out my closest Aunt, on my Dad's side, has been declared (and I  HATE this word) brain-dead. Brain-dead. Almost a cliche. Like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or Channel 8 serial.  She's on life support right now, and I don't have the full details, but suffice to say, I'm shocked. I had no idea this was coming. Her cancer's been in remission for awhile, and I'd never known that she'd been in-and-out of the hospital over the last couple of months. This was sudden. Bringing up her name always conjured up images of love, warmth, and fantastic food that we'd always enjoy at her place during CNY. And though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the Lunar New Year period, we've maintained a certain sense of closeness, I feel. I'd anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in December (even during CNY again if possible), or if not, at the wedding in April, but now...  I don't know what I feel. Close, yet distant. Worried, anxious, helpless, yet...not quite believing it. Not quite coming to terms. Maybe my mum's message was wrong. Maybe it was a "she  might  be brain-dead" kinda thing - mum often leans towards theatrics, it run in my family.  We'll just have to wait and see. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully. Prayerfully. Uncomprehendingly.

       Lull  Am suddenly filled with the depressive haze that assaults me in periodic moments.  After the high from learning and utilising my brain at the Rikk Watts seminar over the last couple of days, coupled with the social performance of maintaining friendships over a meal, I'm suddenly feeling really, really, for lack of a better word,  sian .  I suddenly feel like I'm being extremely unproductive. Lots to do - but it's all a blur of tasks that I'm not quite up to doing. It's all the planning I have to do - hate sitting at a desk, interacting with a voiceless machine, and trying to articulate the swim of thoughts and things-that-need-to-be-done in point form. Am expected to plan and strategise. but am neither equipped nor have the passion to do so! I totally dislike a desk-bound job.  And there's the praying meeting in an hour-and-a-half's time, which I don't feel like going to, yet don't wish to spend my night distracting myself with the meaningless void of watching TV or a movie. It's a waste of time, which I've always known, yet can't seem to tear myself from. Hence I've to put my foot down on that one right now. Which is why I'm going for the meeting. Altho' of course, a huge part is so I won't disappoint the people who expect me to be there - BUT! If that element serves to stop me from distracting myself with other meaningless objects, then so be it.  ARGH. The groans and pains of a growing Christian living in the POST-post-modern world. Blech.

       Grandma  I was suddenly reminded of my grandma. Of the fraility of life. Of the lossness of memory, of being a prisoner of self, of the fading distance between the conscious mind and the unconscious one. The reminder served to halt all trains of thought and brought great, sobbing tears to my eyes. Will I see her when I return in December? Will she live long enough to celebrate my impending marriage? Will she be there, waiting on the front porch, smiling through the haze of her cloudy vision?  I wrote this in response, to that reminder:  "I'm crying at work. Sobbing in fact. Mostly due to the feeling of abject horror and loss, a total and overwhelming sense of helplessness, and guilt. Oh the guilt. That I can't even give her a hug when I most want to, that she has totally recessed from my conscious mind, only to turn up as a blip in my radar when her name is mentioned.  But yet I understand the passage of life, the frailty and fruitlessness of the achievements made in decades past, fading as distant drops in the misty horizon. Which is why I'm reminded once again, that I cannot live it the way most do, climbing, clawing, attaining and ultimately losing, everything. And I'm cheered, and conforted, by the fact that she's as much an eternal being as me and you; her body and mind will disappear, but her soul, bouyed by her faith and belief in her Saviour, will never cease to exist."  To the person who reminded me, I hope you understand, too. Not because I seem to know the answer, and that this is the only answer, but it's my source of comfort and strength.  He  is. And will be.

       Food Alert  Am reading a book Charles  lent to me called  Eat Chocolate, Drink Alcohol and Be Lean and Healthy  by Andrew Jobling.  Sounds impossible? Yeah it does to me too.  But catchy title aside, it's pointing out that nutritional dieting may not neccesarily mean a deprivation of all luscious food, great and holy. From the glimpses I've had, it's pointing out how moderation is key, understanding how your body works, and maintaining a healthy relationship with food to ensure quality life over YEARS. So that means a good balanced meal of protein, veggies, and YES! CARBS and FAT even! HAH! Take that, consumer marketing....No fads. Watching your Glycemic intake, eating smaller but more frequent meals, among other things. So bring on the chockkies, (just not as much tho'!) :-)  On another note, am also checking out this supposedly free weight-loss programme, also touting long term effects, by watching calories. Hmmm...  Oh well, we'll see how it goes. Don't worry folks, am not planning significant weight-loss, just wanna tone up and de-train myself from the unhealthy obsession with processed junk food (that's not just at Maccers but in your local supermarket too! Sob....). Am signing up with the Arrow gym too! Can ya believe it? Target date: by Yuli's wedding in December...
