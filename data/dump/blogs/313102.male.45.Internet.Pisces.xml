I've been working on a dialup, and I had a phoone bill that would make your eyes water. I'm planning to upgrade my connection, at which point, normal services will be resumed, but until then (say, the end of January?), I just can't afford the connection time to maintain the flow. Bits and pieces will continue to appear from time to time, so don't be a stranger. Happy and peaceful new year to you and yrz.

As the article points out:  "If you were to suggest that the Roman Catholic church had a questionable record on human rights through the ages and, while we're about it, transubstantiation seems to be pushing it a bit far, nobody would claim that you were racially abusing the Italians or the Irish and nobody would take you to court for your point of view.

       urlLink AlterNet     -- Bush 'Unsigns' War Crimes Treaty  [Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton] also helped draft a pending bill in Congress, the American Servicemen's Protection Act (ASPA), which not only bars any U.S. cooperation with the court, but also bars U.S. military aid to other countries unless they agree to shield U.S. troops on their territory from ICC prosecution. It also bans U.S. troops from taking part in UN peacekeeping operations unless the UN Security Council explicitly exempts them from possible prosecution. One version of the bill, which is still being discussed in Congress, would open the way for the president to use force to free U.S. prisoners hauled before the ICC, which is to be located at The Hague, in the Netherlands.   - in which case the policy of the US government, in the event of US personnel being held for trial for war crimes, would be to send special forces to the Hague to bust them out.

      A predatory robot, named Gaak (a klingon word, apparently)   escaped from its enclosure when left unattended for 15mins at a show in Yorkshire and made a run for it:  urlLink Robot fails to find a place in the sun . The owners insist that what it did wasn't particularly intelligent, but concede: "Gaak showed that a two year experiment in maturing robot "thinking" may be proving alarmingly successful." The part of the story that particularly appeals to me is the image of the robot, wandering aimlessly about on the slip road, distracted, you might say, by the dappled sunlight through the trees, soaking up the chaos, and maybe waiting for the apple to drop?

Right off the top of my head, I'd hazard that the record industry can survive as long as they add value to the  packaged  music they sell -  the music industry has never made music as such, it makes packages of music, and most people aren't inclined to make their own packages. Record labels however are unlikely to be able to maintain the kind of feudal, indentured relationship that they currently have over creative artists...

It became a massive hit. He subsequently fell out of the music industry, as he would, until the 60s, when he was persuaded into studios in Los Angeles to record  urlLink Eden's Island  (reissued by REsearch as part of their Incredibly Strange CDs series). There are unreleased fragments of music and poetry by the man  urlLink here  - definitely hear the first piece on the page, which is a retelling of the (possibly autobiographical) "Nature Boy" story...

Ambulance cars came to the accident site with a delay, that is why soldiers tried to relieve pain of the wounded themselves.

      The latest copy of  urlLink The Wire  landed on my doormat this morning, and within, the regular Invisible Jukebox features Arthur Lee of Love. The introductory paragraph stopped me in my tracks - it seems that one Peter Bradley MP entered an Early Day Motion to the House of Commons, inviting the House to acknowledge the status of Forever Changes as the Greatest Rock Album of Alll Time. WTF? I mean, the claim itslef has considerable merit, but surely they're not proposing to debate this in the House? Further researches reveal the following in Hansard: 1369 ARTHUR LEE, LOVE AND FOREVER CHANGES 22:5:02 Peter Bradley * 1  That this House pays tribute to the legendary Arthur Lee, also known as Arthurly, frontman and inspiration of Love, the world's greatest rock band and creators of Forever Changes, the greatest album of all time; notes that following his release from jail he is currently touring Europe; and urges honourable and especially Right honourable Members to consider the potential benefit to their constituents if they were, with the indulgence of their whips, to lighten up and tune in to one of his forthcoming British gigs.  You can see the record for yourself  urlLink here  - but I should mention that this page crashed my machine  twice  when browsed with MSIE (Mac), and only obliged with a result when I switched to Mozilla. Your mileage, as they say, may vary.  (EDMs, by the way, are a species of motion that rarely get any floor time to speak of - they're usually squeezed out by more pressing business, so we're unlikely to see this actually debated... well, now I think I'll go and see what I can find about Peter Bradley MP.

       urlLink This Machine Kills Fascists: Why sub-culture no longer exists, by Nicholas Rombes  - "The frantic replication of reality on TV shows and in movies desperately and unsuccessfully masks the truth that the real is running out -- it's practically all used up." I  think  Rombes is saying that subculture (meaning, possibly avant garde, possibly "underground" culture) has been, in the language of the Situationists, recuperated. If this  is  what he's saying, I disagree somewhat, although I'm probably too marginal in my tastes to be able to tell for sure.  Certainly the fixed narrative, the authoritative "text" of a movie has become (further) blurred by the advent of the DVD, which at least offers the possibilty of breaking with the traditional linear narrative of movies - but this is an incremental change from VHS (which allowed viewers to pause, rewind, slo-mo...) rather than a radical discontinuity. But the DVD is, in the end, another read-only medium: where things get really interesting with the MPG family, whose progeny are amenable to remixing... There's another recent piece by Rombes at CTheory,  urlLink Professor DVD  which addresses the threat that the expanded edition DVD, with its on-board commentaries and what-have-you, poses to  professorial authority . Most of us, I expect, should be able to contemplate this threat with equanimity?

       In Defense of (Some of) The Hundred Albums...  For the past few days, a feature on Jaguaro.org,  urlLink One Hundred Albums You Should Remove from Your Collection , has done the rounds of the blogosphere. Craig Jensen, whose musical tastes I respect enormously, based on the regular  urlLink Featured CDs  at Booknotes,  owns up to having seventeen of the offending hundred in his collection, and  urlLink comments  on these, and invites other bloggers to do similar. Since I'd already started doing just that, (and a link from Booknotes would do my traffic no harm at all!) I went ahead with the following.  Right, context first.  I've been buying music for just about thirty years, and I spent five years as a professional music critic. I possess truly stupid amounts of music, and I'm not that good at getting rid of it, if and when it disappoints. Consequently (?) I have no less than thirty four of the hundred items in Jaguaro's list - if you count vinyl, CDs and MP3 rips - and eight out of Jaguaro's first ten. This could be seen as deplorable.  On the other hand, there are 66 records on the list that I have never owned - many of these I'd consider it pretty damning that you would have them in your collection in the first place (I mean, Green Day? Fugazi? Celine Dion? Rush? Do me a favour...!) and a smattering of albums/artists I've never even heard of, so their inclusion in any list of overrated "classics" is extremely moot. Step up and identify yourselves, Paula Cole, Helmet, Death Cab For Cutie, Sublime... So, in approximately ascending order of disagreement with Jaguaro:     3 years 5 months...  - this is gone already. Everyday People was good - disposable, brightly coloured pop-rap, sounded okay in the context of joints like De La Soul and PM Dawn's first. The rest of it was very quotidian, and the followup record, whose name I cannot recall, was born to languish in remainder bins.    Zen Arcade  - bought this at the time of release, more or less, and I've not played it much since, I have to admit.    Electric  - I have this on vinyl - a promo copy from my days as a music critic. I keep it because the cover is just hilarious, and it's theoretically possible that I would play a track or two in a knowing, ironic sort of a way, for the right audience, but... yeah. I know.    The Joshua Tree  - vinyl promo copy and a miserably bad pressing into the bargain. I used to use this one as an exemplar of high volume, low quality vinyl production that probably served to drive untold millions of consumers into buying their first CD player. (It didn't work on me - I didn't buy my first CD player for another ten years!). Anyway, I was never that keen on stadium rock.     Synchronicity ,  Zenyatta Mondatta  - I didn't think much of the Police while they were together, but as Sting's mostly wretched solo career continued, I came to the conclusion that at least by comparison, the oevre of the Police was respectable and worth investigating. So I allowed secondhand vinyl copies of all the albums to gravitate into my collection, for further study. I have my favourite few tracks, but in most cases I couldn't even tell you which albums they're on, and I have no doubt that a greatest hits would be more than enough.    Physical Grafitti  - hasn't been off the shelf since I got the Remasters on CD. Only ever played Kashmir anyway, as far as I remember.     What's The Story Morning Glory?  - some of the singles have a certain leery charm. I still think  Don't Look Back In Anger is about as great a record - of its stadium singalong type -  as it could possibly be. But Oasis have never made an album I could happily play end to end. Probably I only ever did it once...    Emancipation  - this was where it became all too obvious that His Elfishness had lost the ability to evaluate his own output. I suspect that if you went through eveything he released from  Sign O The Times  onwards, it would be possible to come up with a perfectly respectable collection of work - but it would probably take you months and at the end you would hate him anyway for shovelling out so much crap along the way, too. I'll surrender my copy of Emancipation without complaint, but I'll rip his version of Betcha By Golly Wow, and probably a couple of others too before you take it away, if it's all the same to you.    Vs. ,  Midnite Vultures ,  White Blood Cells ,  Dig Your Own Hole ,  Music for the Jilted Generation ,  Check Your Head/Ill Communication  - these have all filtered into the collection over the last couple of years and to be quite honest I've not become sufficiently familiar with any of them to take them to heart. All the artists concerned have made much better records, and I could certainly live without them - but their presence in the stack causes me no embarrassment at all.    Pulp Fiction OST  - I don't feel strongly one way or the other about this compilation today. I already had Al Green's Greatest Hits, and Dusty's, and a fair stack of Surf Instrumentals. Oddly enough the track that crops up most frequently in my playlists these days is Flowers On The Wall. Go figure.    Daydream Nation  - this is admittedly overrated, and I still prefer everything they did pre-Geffen to anything they've done since, but it would probably make the cut even if I had to lighten my load of post-rock guitar CDs, which of course I don't...     Out of Time  - unfair to judge this on the basis of Radio Song, which I never liked. More than half of the remainder is excellent, and Kate Pierson was about the most inspiring vocal partner Stipey has ever collaborated with. Not my favourite REM album, nor is it  the first I'd ditch (that would be, erm, lemme see... Monster, probably - itself not actually a bad album, just the least interesting thing they've done)     Let It Be ,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band  - I've never thought much of Let It Be, and I've never considered Sgt Pepper as the Beatles' crowning achievement, or even in my favourite three Beatles records. It's one of those records that's impossible to hear, in the same way that it's impossible to see the Taj Mahal. Maybe you had to be there.    Nevermind  - it isn't as good as In Utero, I don't play it as often as Unplugged New York. I'd missed out on a lot of Pixies material, I had some catching up to do there - still do - but at the end of the day it is by no means a bad album.    Live Through This  - recently re-acquired. It doesn't sound as good as it did in 1994, sure enough, and the cover was always one of the best things about it (I would have liked a poster - I think I still would) but it's a hell of a lot better than  Celebrity Skin .     Bitches Brew ,  Giant Steps  - okay so Jaguaro doesn't like jazz. I do. BB is a bit like the Sgt Pepper of fusion - not the greatest, but (one of) the first and a radical statement of intent. Try On The Corner instead. Or better still, if you share Jaguaro's antipathy towards jazz, don't bother.    Transformer  - this was one of the first CDs I bought, certainly one of the first CDs which I already owned on vinyl, before I prevailed upon myself not to do this unless the vinyl was seriously unplayable. Come to think of it, it was one of the first dozen or so albums that I bought, period. So, sentimentality plays a big part in my estimation here. Sure its cheesy and fey and camp - it's supposed to be! I can play this end to end - not that I do very often - and it brings back some of the better memories of being thirteen again.     Dark Side of The Moon  - this one has fluctuated in my estimation, over the years. I  never owned a vinyl copy of it (only ever bought the Syd Barratt period on vinyl, and I think I may have picked up Meddle at some point too) but hey, I was thirteen when it came out, and back then it was everywhere. It was like the Beatles in the 60s, part of everyday life.    Grateful Dead  - after many long years of resistance to the Dead, I wound up with budget reissue CDs of American Beauty and Working Man's Dead, and they're both pretty decent albums. I have more affection for the (expanded) Garcia and Grisman Old and In The Way set that finally came my way early this year, but still...   Finally, I completely and utterly disagree with the inclusion of  Trout Mask Replica ,  Hunky Dory ,  Heaven Up Here ,  The Boatman's Call ,  On How Life Is ,  The Soft Bulletin  and  Mule Variations  - these are all great albums, and with the exception of Heaven Up Here (vinyl, not in the best state of repair, one day I'll pick up the CD), albums I play frequently. Trout Mask Replica is my number one desert island disc - it shows me something new every time I play it. I've heard ignorant populists trying the Emperor's New Clothes routine on this one more than a few times before, and I've never been convinced. There are weak Beefheart albums for sure, but TMR is a long, long way from being one of them.    That's the ones I have. There are others I don't have for which I would offer extenuating circumstances - I never bought Bob Marley's  Legend  compilation because I already owned most of it. For some years, it was the  only   Wailers product on the market, and if I look down the track list today I see very little that I wouldn't want to own. As a long-standing fan of jamaican music between 1960 and about 1982, I do tend to roll my eyes a bit when this is the only representative in someone's collection, but there's nothing wrong with the music itself.

Since the controversy, Batt has applied to re-register the track with MCPS as a pseudonymous Cllint Cage composition, which sounds extremely dodgy to me.  If Batt had just titled or subtitled the piece 'tribute to John Cage' or something of that nature, things would be different, but since he credited the piece on the CD as Batt/Cage, it seems to me that he should pay up.

       urlLink Nightmare scenario of antibiotic resistance has arrived  - they're heee-ere! The first confirmed case of vancomycin-resistant staph aureus bugs were found last month in a Michigan man. Vancomycin is the last-resort antibiotic, at the time of writing. The implications of this are just horrible - many surgical procedures could become too risky to be undertaken anymore, if no treatments exist to combat infections. The strain found in Michegan did in fact respond to treatment with a newer (and vastly more expensive, they'll have us know) antibiotic, linezolid - but other  strains have been shown to have developed resistance to that one  within a year of it hitting the market , so it's likely a super-resistant staph meeting will occur sooner rather than later.

This article could have been written fifteen years ago, and even then would have been thought rather old-fashioned. It is postmodernism's legitimation crisis all over again for the hard of hearing - how will you decide what is really happening? Same as before: your reality field will be pretty much owned by the media operator who devotes the most (and 'best') resources to controlling it. The truth is still, presumably, out there somewhere - but it will remain unknowable, unverifiable and possibly unrecognisable. Tou will look to your peers for validation. You will rely on trusted sources, your guru method or teacher, to tell you what's what (which makes you more vulnerable to hoodwinkery, surely?) - but you will never know.  In the end, I suspect this matters less than it appears when we try to theorise our way out of the problem, because the 'problem' has been with us as long as symbolic thought...

The first section, the one that actually begins with "lorem ipsum..." translates as follows:   "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains." (1914 translation by H. Rackham)

      Temporary aside: if your blog has disappeared from my blogroll in the last couple of days, please don't be alarmed or offended. I started reorganising the blogrolls, had the scheme worked out beautifully, except that my plan was based on the assumption that I had five rolls to play with, when it turns out I only have four. Plan goes out of window, blogrolls in some disarray, re-think in progress...

      Enthusiasm is expecting it's first child - in the  urlLink Blogtree  sense!  Chris Cannon is a friend of my brother's, someone I met a couple of times, years ago in Liverpool, and he's just started his blog,  urlLink The Seventh Circle  a few days ago (no blogroll yet, nor has the birth been registered at Blogtree) but he's emailed to let me know that enthusiasm was his inspiration - along with a bunch of very complimentary stuff with which I won't detain you, but for which I am very glad, and promise to continue to try to set (some kind of) an example. (BTW, Blogtree appears to be down just now - I wouldn't be at all surprised if it's outgrown its bandwidth allocation. I'll try again later...)  Also,  Sarah and I met up with  urlLink Owen  and  urlLink Tammy  last night at the  urlLink Old Thameside Inn  by London Bridge, and had a really excellent evening, which happened to include at one point trying to explain blogs and blogging to a fellow reveller, from first principles. This was a welcome exercise, although I suspect that my  description was abstract enough not to be as helpful as a more specific and less encompassing definition might have been. Or maybe it was just the beer.

      I've been thinking about the  urlLink Guardian blogging contest  recently,  and the likely bandwidth implications for whoever gets fingered. Not that long ago, Ev (CEO of Blogger.com, and one of the Guardian judges) blogged a  urlLink story  about a blogger who asked to be removed from blogger.com's blogs of note, because she couldn't afford the extra traffic. I found myself wondering how much of a bite the bandwidth costs of the increased traffic would take out of the prize - and whether a year's worth of unlimited bandwidth wouldn't be a more suitable prize, instead of or as well as the cash? It's a bit late to be suggesting it, of course - but  then again, if you're here looking for  actual advice  - bwooy, you must be having a  time ...!

       urlLink Bush's Forest Fire Plan: Log It All  A long-ish article by Jeffrey St. Clair on the history of forestry maintenance in the Western US, which underlines the total cynicism of the  urlLink WMPC 's recently announced "solution" to the forest fire "problem"...  In the name of fire prevention, Bush wants to okay the timber industry to log off more than 2.5 million acres of federal forest over the next ten years. He wants it done quickly and without any interference from pesky statutes such as the Endangered Species Act. Bush called his plan "the Healthy Forests Initiative". But it's nothing more than a giveaway to big timber, that comes at a high price to the taxpayer and forest ecosystems. Bush's stump speech was a craven bit of political opportunism, rivaled, perhaps, only by his call to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling as a way to help heal the nation after the attacks of September 11. That plan sputtered around for awhile, but didn't go anywhere in the end. But count on it: this one will.

For they are cold, and they are filled with all manner of hazardous substances and raw sewage and other pollutants.” And the Lord responded, “fear not, Harvey, for a great bridge will be built, and the people will cross into this land. And this land will be called Berkeley.

There are in fact only two blogs in my neighbourhood, according to Blogstreet:  urlLink The Bloviator  (which I linked to and commented on about a month ago) and  urlLink Prandial Post , which I have visited once or twice, but never linked to, nor, as far as I know, has Prandial  ever linked to me.

       urlLink  War of the worlds  - the speculations last year concerning the origins of the name, al-Qaida have not only failed to go away, they have provided Giles Foden with the meat for an intriguing essay in yesterday's Guardian:   "This peculiar coincidence would be of little interest if not for abundant parallels between the plot of Asimov's book and the events unfolding now," wrote Dmitri Gusev, the scientist who posted the article. He was referring to apparent similarities between the plot of Foundation and the pursuit of the organisation we have come to know, perhaps erroneously, as al-Qaida. The Arabic word qaida - ordinarily meaning "base" or "foundation" - is also used for "groundwork" and "basis". It is employed in the sense of a military or naval base, and for chemical formulae and geometry: the base of a pyramid, for example. Lane, the best Arab-English lexicon, gives these senses: foundation, basis of a house; the supporting columns or poles of a structure; the lower parts of clouds extending across a horizon; a universal or general rule or canon. With the coming of the computer age, it has gained the further meaning of "database": qaida ma'lumat (information base)...

I still don't think that what we see there is 'what Blogcritics.com will be like'.  I don't believe for a moment that the opinions of the Blogcritics posse, as it presently is, are worth more than anyone else's. The Blogcritics posse, in fact, cannot be said to have any idea of itself at all, at this early stage. Whether it develops one or not. remains to be seen. "A sinister cabal of the best writers on the web" is amusing hype, nothing more. I know I'm not a part of any cabal (heh - but then I would say that, wouldn't I?)  I suspect that the site is as much about concentrating traffic through Blogcritics.com's Amazon affilation account as anything else. I don't mind that too much (though I'll be interested to see how much that drags in over the next three months) . I still own whatever I post, and I'm getting traffic coming to check out my blog. Where's the harm? There are good, sometimes great, conversations happening all over, I'm just looking at Blogcritics.com as another place to go and find some. A forum for general discussion will be essential. That and a lot more consideration given to the design and architecture of the site - but in the end, what's occured there is a better-than-reasonable beginning. Oh and talking about dispensing "FREE CDS!!!" at the beginning (or at all) was a big mistake, imho. Ah well.

       Barberries Are Not The Only Fruit Sarah brought home a bag of tiny red fruits, labelled entirely with Arabic script. I'd seen these things in North African and Mid-Eastern cooking, but I never knew what they were called, and it took a little while before S. remembered that they are barberries.  Barberries (botanical name  urlLink Berberis. ) are named from the same root as the  urlLink Berber  (or Tamazigh for the language, or Amazigh for the people) of North Africa ( urlLink BBC World Service page ), among whom the  urlLink Tuareg  are numbered. The Amazigh have an  urlLink Action Coalition Website  whose motto reads in english:  "Handle your roots and move forward"  (I'm absolutely  sure  that's lost quite a bit in translation, but hopefully gained a little, too). There's probably an entire blog to be written about the Berber, but enough for now, back to the little red berries. The most unexpected thing I found out about barberries is that the cultivation of all species (of which there are a great many, distributed thoughout temperate climates) was  urlLink banned in Canada for nearly 40 years  - seems that some species are prone to a fungus that also  urlLink affects cereal crops . Last year they lifted the ban on rust-resistant varieties. The barberry is a noble beast - high in vitamin C, stuffed with pectin and rather sharp tasting, they can be used to make  urlLink wine , they are used as a thickening agent in  urlLink jams and jellies , and there are more than a few good couscous and rice dishes: for example  urlLink Tahcheen-zereshk (Rice  with barberries and chicken)  (This recipe gives a name,  tahdeeg , to the crispy layer at the bottom of the rice pan that Iranian children squabble over. I knew about the crispy layer, and the squabbling part of it more than twenty years ago, when my old friend and flatmate Iraj taught me to cook rice in the Persian style, but he didn't tell me that the crispy layer had a name. Truly, you learn something every day).  urlLink Morasah Polow  is also a chicken dish and looks rather similar, but if you're vegetarian check out  urlLink Morassa' Polo (Bejeweled Pilaf)  - I'm definitely going to give this a go. Hmmm, Sarah's birthday tomorrow. I wonder...  UPDATE:  Well, I made the Morassa' Polo, with a few slight modifications: cashews for pistachios, and just the outer zesty rind of orange, rather than the whole peel. It went down very well, too... even the tahdeeg came off splendidly...

      Working through my considerable backlog of mailing list posts, I find that a couple of days ago,  urlLink The World Conflict Discussion List  recieved a subscription request from an individual who was either a supporter or a member of Al-qaeda. It is quite proper that Al-qaeda should be able to engage in dialogue on this list, the purpose of which (save you clicking through) is:   "to bring together the diverse groups presently engaged in warfare to discuss their views and experiences on an individual basis. It is hoped that we can foster understanding and perhaps convince people that words not bombs can effect compromise and change that will lead to peace"

Nice to see that credit is going, belatedly, where credit is due. MS does shout to TB at the bottom of the piece, but strangely, I can find no navigable links on the page. You can search for the pieces on Scifi.com, but there's no sub-menu in evidence there. I suggest you replace "carbon.html" in the URL above with the element of your choice, and see what you find. And if anyone does find a menu page (I canvisualise a really cool interface for this!) let me know and I'll add the link here.

The commentary is also good - he had his first slashdotting yesterday, as visitors deluged his server picking up copies of the Lessig talk, and the pride and satisfaction in his writing (that his server stood up to the pressure) is wonderfully evident. he also points to an absorbing  urlLink Slashdot thread  about free_culture... The other thing about random($foo) is that the design-and-technology lag between his front page and his  urlLink about page  is even more precipitous than mine (not that this is likely to be true for very long)...

       urlLink Oin  has his doubts about the accuracy of  urlLink Hot Or Not?  He seems to have an extraordinarily (actually mathematically impossible) rating. I find the feature puzzling for other reasons. I put up enthusiasm on Hot Or Not? a few days ago - go and  urlLink rate me  if you want, I don't care one way or the other - and the results are altogether uninteresting, except for the fact that, according to my referrals, there are quite a few more people coming here from the site than there are voting. This suggests two possibilities: maybe the sight of enthusiasm when you're not ready for it causes visitors to lose the will to live, or maybe they get here, start reading, follow a link somewhere, and they forget to come back with a rating. Your guess is as good as mine.

"When my grandkids meet a blind guy with a brain implant," says Jerry, explaining his participation in Dobelle's experiments, "I wanted them to be able to say, 'Let me tell you about my grandfather.'" ... Dobelle has designed a three-part system: a miniature video camera, a signal processor, and the brain implants. The camera, mounted on a pair of eyeglasses, captures the scene in front of the wearer. The processor translates the image into a series of signals that the brain can understand, then sends the information to the implant.

The Electoral Commission in the UK is considering adding a box on ballot papers in which it will be possible to cast your vote for "none of the above". Amusingly, they want to do this because they think it will increase voter turn-out. I don't think so. But what I'd like to know is whether non-attenders will be added to the "none of the above" supporters - in which case, fairly solid mandates for "none of the above" may become the rule, rather than the exception. I don't think that would be quite the effect that the measure is intended to provoke.

       urlLink O'Reilly Network: Blogging for Dollars - Giving Rise to the Professional Blogger [Aug. 12, 2002]  Meg Hourihan proposes that businesses (some, not all) should hire bloggers of proven ability to blog on their behalf. She offers examples: Google coould hire someone to blog developments with the APIs, insurance companies could hire someone to blog information of interest to their actual or potential policyholders, Wine.com could hire somebody... you get the idea. I can see the benefit in the first example, but after that it gets a little muddy.  Once we disregard the inconsequential chatterings of teenyboppers (I'm not knocking it, I'm really not, but I don't have to read the goddamn stuff) and the tedious 'patriotic' willy-waving of the warbloggers (ditto), the blogosphere is populated by writers who have something to say about something, and they say it, without asking anyone's permission, without having to confirm to someone else's house style, editorial policy or commercial agenda. How well or how badly they (we) do it is beside the point - but if you're employed to 'blog' on behalf of someone else's commercial interests, you are not a blogger, you are a hack, and you are not to be trusted. [IMPORTANT AFTERTHOUGHT: this comment is NOT directed at anyone in particular, especially not Meg, whose blogging is a pleasure to read :) ] Much as we would all like to be paid for the hours we spend rooting around for unconsidered truffles in the reeky wood of  the web (to paraphrase Dylan Thomas) to say nothing of the time we devote to composing delicious commentary upon our prizes, what is on offer here in nothing more than a recuperation - in the Situationist sense - of the blogging phenomenon, by the greed machine.  Okay, a counter-example: say I read a wine column in my paper of choice on a saturday; both the paper and the writer have a reputation for impartiality to maintain, and if it were to be discovered that the writer was taking backhanders from supermarket X Y or Z, there would be an outcry, there would be very red faces all round, the column would be history, and quite right too. Of course only the most naive of readers would imagine that the contents of the column were entirely impartial, exhaustively researched, positively the last word. Most of us would weigh up the odds, make our own judgement, perhaps based on previous recommendations that had proved reliable (or otherwise). When reading a wine company's pet 'blogger', however, almost the only thing we will know for an absolute fact that the review will be geared around selling a particular line, persuading us to buy from a particular supplier, whatever. Any reliable information gleaned from such a source would be completely fortuitous.  I have first-hand knowledge of how this system works. Years ago, I wrote a few record reviews for a couple of in-store magazines.  No-one ever told me what kind of a review to write, but...  Behaviour modification invades at every turn. Averil, features editor at  Spend  magazine (acting on orders, you understand) told me today that from the next issue "we" are working a new "system" on the record reviews. I had a feeling what was coming next. And I was right. From now on there is no such thing as a bad review in  Spend . They want favourable comments on all records reviewed in the magazine, and if a record is declared by the reviewer to be complete and utter crap, it goes into a side column of records "also available" without review or comment.  Editorial policy at  Spend  is supervised in some way or other by the distributor, a major chainstore media retailer. When an editor calls one up and tells one that "we" are now working to a new "system", that from now on, records which are crap are no longer crap, they are now "also available", one naturally leans forward to examine this new "system". What manner of system is this being swung in here? Does it provide the consumer, bless him, with better information, because the news is all good? Does anyone get to find out what a record is like? Does it enhance, or does it undermine the credibility of the reviews that are included? Are we critics, or are we advertising copy writers? Are we  paid  to be advertising copy writers?

I sat there with my eyes open, watching the world around me go crazy, thinking, the lights could go out any time now... when everything stopped, I was still holding the wheel, and there wasn't a scratch on either myself or my passenger, who was unrolling from a foetal crouch as I looked around. Actually, no - the last joint of my little finger, right hand, became a little swollen for a few days, probably  from gripping the wheel too hard. The radio was still on. The ground was back where it belonged; we were facing the wrong way in a lane narrow enough to make it extremely difficult to turn around in, at least at ground level. The car was totalled. I mean, not just a little bit. It didn't move of it's own volition ever again...

What I mean is, I've jumped aboard  urlLink Eric Olsen's blogcritics.com wheeze , without any clear idea of where it's heading. After reading his and other people's posts on the subject, I'm not that convinced that anyone else has much more of an idea than I do, either, but let's roll with it. I've assured Eric that I'd put up some kind of music review by Friday, and Friday it is. Why not start with an album that did more than any other to broaden my musical (and intellectual, and possibly political) horizons?   "Her influence today is undeniable," said Michael Stipe of REM, "There' s not anybody I know in a band anywhere who not revere the records that she put out. There was a rawness and energy to Horses that I had not heard in any other music. From then on, my life was changed."

I probably had no more than a couple of dozen albums to my name back then, and a third of those would have been Bowie (so the sexual ambiguity - such an important part of what made Bowie so striking in the early 70s - was already a feature in the landscape).  It took two months for copies of Horses to appear in the shops in Liverpool, and when I got it home and played Gloria for the first time, I was anxious, first of all, that I hadn't put too much faith in CSM's persuasion. This was the first time I'd ever bought a record by an artist I'd never heard, simply on the basis of a piece of rock journalism, and a brand new release at that. I probably paid what, two and a half quid for it, which was money in those days... Well, the music was ragged: guitars thrust out at peculiar angles, the piano sounded like it was actually  prowling  around the studio. And Patti's voice, my God, and  urlLink the things she said . "Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine..." no-one has opened their debut album with such a radical (and true) statement of intent, before or since.  It was quite a shock to the system. It completely shattered whatever preconceptions I might have had about what rock music could do, what it could contain, what it could promise and more to the point, what it could deliver: passion, poetry and intelligence  all at the same time  - and once the strangeness had subsided, it became perfectly clear that you could, after all, dance to it.  Patti Smith turned out to be the flip-side (good grief, I'm regressing into vinyl-speak!) of glam: literate, allusive, predatory and strident, in a good way. She was utterly unlike any woman I'd ever seen in rock music before. Even if I'd known of Janis Joplin at the time (I probably didn't), any comparison would have been fatuous: Patti was totally in charge of herself, she projected a vision of deliverance and redemption  through rock'n'roll, and unlike Bowie, there was no trace of ironic distance - bear in mind that at this point in Bowie's career, Young Americans was the latest release, and while it was all fine and interesting, he seemed to be receding into thinness (and whiteness, and erm, dukishness) it looked like ironic distance was all we had left of him.  Horses provided a set of clues that continued to unravel and offer leads into unknown territory for years afterwards. (Oh and the second album,  urlLink Radio Ethiopia , is just as good, except of course that you can never experience that shock of awakening in quite the same way, after the first time...)

It all seems to work okay at this end on MSIE5.1/Mac, and Mozilla doesn't screw up the layout any worse than it did before (what is it with Mozilla's implementation here? The javascripts are pretty basic stuff. Any suggestions welcome on that. Seems not to work in Opera either - I may have to re-think my browser test and branching script moratorium...!).  If any of these modifications are causing your browser/platform any more terminal grief  - I'm especially interested in hearing the view from the Windoze side of the fence - please let me know, we'll see what we can do...

It seems he's played Baron Harkonnen in a US TV version of  urlLink Dune , with Children of Dune to come next year. People who like the books - I've never got into them - seem to prefer this to David Lynch's 1984 version. I've found the Lynch movie slighlty less dreadful with each of the maybe three viewings I've endured over the years, but I still wouldn't go out of my way to look at it again. Anyway, I was bigging up Ian McNeice. Enthusiasm salutes you, sir.

(It''s been released on VHS & DVD now). In case you're not familiar, The Stone Tape explored the idea that the physical environment can act as a recording medium. The play used images of technological investigation of "paranormal" phenomena, which was an impressive idea to me at the time. It was also scary as hell, beck then, though I suspect it wouldn't pack the same punch today. The Stone Tape is of historical interest on a number of accounts.

During's implication is that there is something fundamentally flawed about the contention made by critics from Siegfried Kracauer (who in 1927 analysed the high kicks of dancing girls as "the rational and empty form of the cult"), through Debord, Baudrillard and Virilio, that commercial cinema represents the "triumph of the spectacle"; that it is not an exercise in secular magic but in power magic, the most overt manifestations of which are the Nazi propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl.

The thread doesn't exactly fly, but it was a nice little find for a very minor league Heraclitean living in Sydenham.

       And here, because we need a picture after the intolerable screed below, is something else I found in my old notebooks yesterday when I was looking for the wiggly wall. I never did anything with this idea, so if anybody has a (non-commercial) use for it, be my guest. Actually, this is a hasty reworking of the idea from the notebook - the orginal doodle was very rough. By the way, does anyone know what the correct font is for UK road signs? I've used Mittelschrift here, which I believe is used in Germany, and I know it  isn't the correct one for the UK...

       urlLink [blog drone]  This is really quite scary. Michal Zalewski, who is clearly a very twisted individual, has written this blogging bot, which will spew out long and passionate journal / blog entries when provided with a seed phrase. He recommends stuff like "I am depressed" or "school is stupid", and advises that there is no point in giving it any exotic phrases. Oh and should you so desire, the blog drone will do it in Polish.  I gave the blog drone the word "shave" (for no better reason than I need to), and after a little while, it gave me the following:  We shave her every year to humiliate her in hopes that eventually she will commit doggie suicide. But it was fun playing little musical messages into the atmosphere in hopes that someone would appreciate them. And hey dog guano just adds to the atmosphere right. Scurrying away from her like a small child who just realized that they pushed their older brother to the limit and are about to take the beating of their life :0 We may lose our bid runs. Considering i didnt cancel this years bash we may have a nye repeat that once again leaves me and my friends in our respective homes toasting with mugs of thera-flu rather than cheap champagne. Now he just wanted to fix it :0 He just happened to be the right sum of variables just as i had been a convenient female ;) Which just happened to list me in the pm group rather than design?

      Chris C. of  urlLink The Seventh Circle  has followed up on my complaint about the non-appearance of a big red circle over the UK at the IRIS Seismic Monitor site. The circle is there now, but since it's a few days old, it's now yellow. No matter, my faith in IRIS is somewhat restored. I clicked through for the details on the 'quake, and found that the time given was 2002/09/22 23:53:14.0 - which means that I  did  feel the earth move after all. I'd been dozing gently on the sofa, and I thought that two extremely heavy bits of traffic had passed by the window. The BBC report had given the time of the quake as an hour later (summer time difference?), by which time I think I would have been asleep.   urlLink   Chris also writes that he has cashed in a two-year-old birthday present, and taken his first lesson in falconry, which strikes my as extremely cool. There's something neo-palaeolithic (and something Moorish too, of course) about falconry. There  are  urlLink pictures .

I hope he's past even being irritated by the reminders by now) on the audacious courage of... oh, you already got that part.  Tony Blair's dedication to carrying out the policies of the White House proves time and again that he has the courage of their convictions. He is prepared to back Mr Bush's arguments to the hilt even when they are palpably nonsensical. When Mr Bush cites Saddam Hussein's contempt for UN Security Council resolutions as the justification for his own determination to do the same, Tony Blair urges the President's case, for all the world as if he couldn't see the ridiculousness of it. When Mr Bush cites Iraq's failure to comply with UN Security Council resolutions as the reason for going to war, Mr Blair backs him up, boldly ignoring the fact that Turkey and Israel have got away with ignoring UN resolutions for years.

      Leafing through Euen Semple's recent-ish posts, I find a recommendation of  urlLink Jonathan Delacour's blog , where in turn I find  urlLink this , quoted by Mark Pilgrim in early August, which Mark found tucked into the XML source code for his Dive Into Python (presumably Mark's own words, then, although he doesn't say definitely). The final sentence is as elegant and concise an approach to time management as any I have seen; it expresses my feeling about time management, which I recall promising to go away and think about, which I did, and to come back and let you know my conclusions, if any, which I didn't, mainly because my conclusion was pretty facetious: "decide what doesn't need to be done, and go right ahead without delay, and not do it". This is a lot better:  As I write this, the year is 2000, and the Internet is a battleground of intellectual property disputes. Some people would like you to believe that, without proper financial incentives, music, literature, and computer software would disappear. After all, who would make music if they can't make money on it? Who would write? Who would program? I know the answer. The answer is that musicians will make music, not because they can make money, but because musicians are the people who can't not make music. Writers will write because they can't not write. I?ve been programming for 16 years, writing free software for 8. I can?t imagine not doing this. If you can imagine yourself not doing what you're doing, do something else. Do whatever it is that you can't not do.

       urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | Hypocrisy is on the march  Zoe Williams in the Guardian, echoing my thoughts as the numbers at the countryside march in London were announced:  When it comes to public protest, there are some irritating double-standards in this country, of which the most immediately irritating is this: on Sunday, the police estimated 300,000 at the Countryside Alliance march, where the organisers counted 400,000. Fair enough. There is always a counting discrepancy between the police and the marchers, though on leftwing protests it is usually rather larger (the police used to put CND marches at 30,000, roughly the size of a football crowd, which made their ability to fill Hyde Park and beyond nothing short of miraculous). Yesterday morning, however, newspapers were quoting as fact the final figure of 407,791; the Metropolitan police had brought their estimate up to 400,000, presumably because these are people in tweeds and therefore cannot be lying. This may, as so many point out, be the largest peaceful protest in British history, but it's also the first British protest in history where everyone agreed how large it was...

I think it has something to do with the energy of love. Contact with this energy results in the exercise of a kind of balance in the chaos of existence. A saint does not dissolve the chaos; if he did the world would have changed long ago. I do not think that a saint dissolves the chaos even for himself, for there is something arrogant and warlike in the notion of a man setting the universe in order. It is a kind of balance that is his glory. He rides the drifts like an escaped ski. His course is the caress of the hill. His track is a drawing of the snow in a moment of its particular arrangement with wind and rock. Something in him so loves the world that he gives himself to the laws of gravity and chance. Far from flying with the angels, he traces with the fidelity of a seismograph needle the state of the solid bloody landscape. His house is dangerous and finite, but he is at home in the world. He can love the shape of human beings, the fine and twisted shapes of the heart. It is good to have among us such men, such balancing monsters of love." [ Beautiful Losers (1966) ]

       urlLink  On the road to nowhere  Iain Sinclair interviewed, as the publication date of his latest psychogeographic investigation,  urlLink London Orbital , draws near. I've found that I prefer Sinclair's psychogeography over the fiction (although I've yet to read  urlLink White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings ); the style is more pumped up in the fiction (it's a style that can definitely be overdone, as certain sections of  urlLink Downriver  attest) and I find many of his characters impenetrable, but the psychogeography books totally boil what remains of my brains. London Orbital promises a visit with J.G Ballard, lots of Bram Stoker, the site of the first Martian invasion, from H.G. Wells' War of The Worlds, and yes, if you're reading this in some professional capacity, a review copy would be very nice indeed. The following gives indication of how much I'm looking forward to it.  Somehow I'd managed not to read any Sinclair at all until about three years ago; I knew the name, and I had some indication that his work would be of interest, but still, I didn't crack the spine of a Sinclair book until my good friend Clive in Wales gave me the kind of recommendation of  urlLink Lights Out For The Territory  that only a complete idiot would ignore, and my idiocy is... incomplete. So I bought the book, read the book and called Clive to enthuse.  "You know he's reading here tomorrow night?" said Clive. "What!? I'll be there!" I said. The next day I went into work with my bag packed. Sorry to spring it on you like this, but I have to be in Aberystwyth tonight. I'll be back this tomorrow lunchtime. "Er, okay", they said, and I was gone.   urlLink   Here's a picture I took on the train, some village in Herefordshire, moving at speed.   I was there in time to meet up with Clive, IS and others for a drink before the gig (and by happy coincidence,  urlLink Niall Griffiths  was reading in town that evening too, and so we checked that out) and then up the hill to the Aber Arts Centre and this is  urlLink  himself, silhouetted against projected video noise , during the reading/screening, 9th November... hmmm, 9-11-99 in UK date order...

I think not, especially because, irrespective of the horror of the World Trade Centre attacks, the US has no moral right to impose its will on our continent. After all, we in Latin America have ample experience with US terrorist tactics. In our continent alone 90,000 people disappeared as a direct result of the operation of the School of the Americas and US "counterinsurgency" policies - 30 times more than the victims of the World Trade Centre.

      I don't know how it's been around your neighbourhood this week, but around here, some people have been losing it; being on the verge of it, and then suddenly, not being on the verge anymore.  People have been snapping like twigs.   And so it is, as it happens, in the ever more brutal world of mainstream TV entertainment.  In  urlLink The Chair , a new game show on the BBC with John McEnroe (no lie), contestants  are required to keep their heart rate below a critical level whilst answering mostly multiple choice questions, and smiling indulgently through MacEnroe's rather tedious bantering. this show appears to reward a "skill" that might otherwise be interpreted as, well, a bit  sociopathic ... I wonder how many they've auditioned to camera? I wonder how many they've screened in total, and how. I bet a documentary plunge into those stats could be made an awful lot more interesting than this bogus quiz show with a tacky set, and John MacEnroe reminding us every ninety seconds that he used to lose it now and then? I only mention it because seeing a show like this isn't that frequent an occurence for me, so its noteworthy to me, but I wouldn't expect it to be a regular feature or anything. There's a  urlLink flash version  online, but I don't think I can have understood it very well, because I failed that that even more miserably than I would imagine failing in the TV game, and that's saying something...  urlLink   Adding considerably to the freak-out theme, Sarah brought round a library copy of  urlLink Themroc (1972)  which is a truly startling experience: Michel Piccoli totally freaking out & going feral, from a standing start in a mundane contemporary existence. And then people begin to follow his example... It comes apart a bit in the closing stages, lapsing into a rather  portentous, heavy-handed conclusion - it can't be easy deciding  where to  stop  with a movie like this - but the first two thirds of it are brilliant, raging, extraordinary. There's a review  urlLink here , and another one, more substantial but on a lime green page,  urlLink here . Oh yes, and - one of the first things I intended to mention about this movie - it's the only one I've ever seen where the language classification on the case says, and I quote: "Gibberish" - there are almost no intelligible words in the script. All characters communicate and express themselves  non-verbally  throughout. Absolutely, anthropologically compelling.

       urlLink  Urgent Appeal - Amina Lawal Must Not Face Death by Stoning  Amina Lawal, a 30 year old single mother in Nigeria, faces the prosect of being stoned to death once she has weaned her baby, unless some pretty serious global opinion can be mobilised to convince the Nigerian government to overturn her sentence. Despite any gut feelings we may have about the imperviousness of Shariah to appeals to human decency, there is some hope that we can prevail in this case. There was another woman,  urlLink Safiya Hussaini , in the same hellish situation earlier this year, whose sentence was  urlLink overturned  back in March... So - go sign the  urlLink open letter  (718,440 signatories so far) to the Nigerian government, organised by  urlLink Merton group  of Amnesty International.

      Following a sequence of links so arcane and obscure I'm not sure I could even repeat, let alone describe it, I've just found that hax0r activist /advocacy group  urlLink CULT OF THE DEAD COW  now has a blog. If I'd imagined a cDc blog in advance, which I have to admit I had neglected to do, I think I'd have come up with something a little more interesting than what I found there, but I've yet to venture into the archives. There may be treasure lurking still. A word of caution btw about the  urlLink Kingdom Of Piracy , which is cDc's latest "super-dope" link: it's an umbrella site for critical writing and rather dubious net.art - I've looked into four of the participant sections in there so far, and two of them have crashed my browser (I'm more inclined to attribute this to inept coding than to malicious intent, but whatever). Of the other two, one was a short essay with non-hyperlinked bibliographical references, which betrays an airy indifference to the benefits of web publishing, apart from anything else - but hardly "super-dope" in any sense I recognise...

      Well, here's a funny thing. Just downloaded  urlLink Netscape 7.0 , fired it up and it seems to render this page rather well, which is a good start. I'll reserve judgement on the new browser until I've spent more time with it, but that isn't the funny thing.  The funny thing is this - you may or may not have noticed I've included a  urlLink referrer's list  script (by Stephen Downes) at the bottom of the page, just a couple of days ago, and it works just fine in MSIE5.1, and Netscape 7.0 - except that the referrer's lists returned by  the script are each perfectly plausible, but they are  mutually exclusive sets  - no referrer appears in both versions. How the hell can that happen? I'm about to check in Mozilla (which first refused to run with Netscape open, and is presently upgrading itself, the little tyke) and Opera. More news as it breaks. Hmmm. Mozilla agrees with Netscape 7.0, which makes sense, because they're both Gecko under the hood - but Opera 5.0 gives me a partial list corresponding to how the MSIE list looked early yesterday. I am perplexed.

      Well, it's a beautiful morning here in Sydenham, just like it was a year ago. The sky is clear and blue just like it was then.  I'd just had a very pleasant lunch with some ex-colleagues, and I'd walked down to Camberwell Green afterwards. I was in the act of buying a secondhand copy of Joy Division's  Still  when the guy behind the counter asked me if I'd heard the news, and his account was pretty accurate, as it turned out.   Fuuuuck, I remarked.  I got on the bus home and stared out of the window, knowing that I'd just heard about something enormous, that things would be different from now on. When I got home, I switched on the TV, and it stayed on for about 36 hours straight.  I haven't played that CD yet. For a while the only thing I could listen to was Jan Garbarek's  Officium  - and then later, the song that came to represent what happened (as much for the subliminal references as anything) in my head:    Well I think it's fine, building jumbo planes.  Or taking a ride on a cosmic train.  Switch on summer from a slot machine.  Get what you want to if you want, 'cause you can get anything.

      Well, I'm back, and while I was gone, I actually finished a book. (This doesn't happen very often lately; I used to do most of my book reading on public transport on the way to and from work, which as you may have gathered, no longer applies.) The book I finished was   urlLink Not The End of The World  (Christopher Brookmyre 1998) which  I picked up from a local charity shop, after seeing it recommended by  urlLink Charlie Stross .  It's pretty much your standard millennial doomsday thriller: there's a dastardly plot to cause a massive tidal wave to engulf Los Angeles - I don't think I'm spoiling anything here; the True Nature of the Dastardly Plot is pretty well apparent to anyone who reads say, the first three chapters - but the  point  of the novel is a tirade against religion in general, and Christianity in particular. The tirade aspect of the book is by far the most effective, imho. The plot's... just a plot; there are conspicuously missed chances in both story and character devolopment, and some of the dialogue falters badly (LA cops using words and phrases that I doubt very much LA cops would ever use) but when Brookmyre gets into rant mode, the writing really takes off. - the porn star's withering denunciation of the TV evangelist - don't worry, you'll know it when you see it - is an absolute delight. I think I might have had to wipe away a tear.  Would I read more? I might. Brookmyre gives good outrage, and the rhythm of the sections told from the viiew of the Scottish photographer (with whom Brookmyre clearly and unapologetically identifies, no blame there) are more successful than some others. Perhaps I've just started with a book in which he's slightly over-reached himself; I'd very much like to see what he did with subject matter that's a bit closer to home.

       urlLink peter greenaway: monsters of macon   A short but pithy interview, originally from 1994, and posted last November. The main issue at the time was a defence of his (then) latest film, The Baby of Macon, which had been denounced even by a number of his close collaborators.  "Often it's the Church who is using the phenomenon of terror and horror in a deeply voyeuristic way to parade its own propaganda - we are prepared to cathartically take ourselves to the edge of human experience, but without responsibility. Television sets every night show us all sorts of terrifying things that happen in Rwanda, South Africa, the Middle East and we don't all have sufficient information and intelligence to separate what is fact from so-called truth and pictorial representation. Those edges become blurred as our anxiety about the education and involvement of children revolves around the perception of what is representation and what isn't. So I make a self-conscious cinema that is saying, "I can play with illusionism, you can be a voyeur, but let's take responsibility of it," because my film doesn't exist without you--the audience--and you are just as much a participant in this as I am."

The museum is (mostly) the work of one Jim Stewart, who has been making art from found objects, with particular reference to the decayed, distressed and broken, since childhood - although how long ago that was is not divulged. The work occupies a place somewhere along the line between Cornell and  urlLink The Brothers Quay . Ordinarily, the museum is only to be found online, because the works are too fragile for straightforward exhibition, but there is to be a showing "probably the first weekend of May 2003" at the  urlLink Silicon Valley Open Studios .   Two sections of the online museum, however, are not Stewart's work, although they are clearly related: there's a small collection of Xenophora assemblages - the work of a species of marine snail which attaches bits of debris to its shell, probably either for camouflage or to stop them from sinking into the soft mud they inhabit. There's also a section devoted to the work of eccentric 17th anatomist and tissue preservation pioneer  urlLink Frederik Ruysch  (1638-1731), who constructed tableaux of foetal skeletons and used hardened, preserved body parts - lungs, major veins and so on - as landscape features.

       urlLink Girl to get tracker implant to ease parents' fears   The parents of an 11-year-old girl are to take the extraordinary step of having her fitted with a microchip so that her movements can be traced if she is abducted... Mrs Duval did not accept that the family were panicking or overreacting, saying it was only sensible for a parent to use technology when it was available. "If a car is stolen, it can be fitted with a computer to enable it to be tracked - so why not apply the same principle to finding missing children?" she said.

         Samhain   I'm irritated by the  urlLink Salon article  which makes the astonishing claim that Halloween was invented in 1929 - and then goes on to discuss its ancient history. Sure they say, but that wasn't Halloween as we know it... well, duh. This is rather like saying that Easter is "about" eggs made of chocolate. Or that Christmas is "about" a fat bloke in a red and white costume (which dates back to a Coca Cola as campaign in the 1920s - before then, Santa's costume was no particular colour. But I digress). Even the Christianised versions of these festivals, from which the Day of the Dead festivals arise, and which have no great claim to authenticity in themselves, are ancient by the Walmart standards which obtain in this article. Samhain is the cross-quarter festival which marks the beginning of winter and of the ancient Celtic new year.  Here's the section of Frazer's  The Golden Bough  that deals with  urlLink Hallowe’en  (as unearthed by  urlLink Eeksy Peeksy ):  The principal fire-festivals of the Celts, which have survived, though in a restricted area and with diminished pomp, to modern times and even to our own day, were seemingly timed without any reference to the position of the sun in the heaven. They were two in number, and fell at an interval of six months, one being celebrated on the eve of May Day and the other on Allhallow Even or Hallowe’en, as it is now commonly called, that is, on the thirty-first of October, the day preceding All Saints’ or Allhallows’ Day. These dates coincide with none of the four great hinges on which the solar year revolves, to wit, the solstices and the equinoxes. Nor do they agree with the principal seasons of the agricultural year, the sowing in spring and the reaping in autumn. For when May Day comes, the seed has long been committed to the earth; and when November opens, the harvest has long been reaped and garnered, the fields lie bare, the fruit-trees are stripped, and even the yellow leaves are fast fluttering to the ground...

You don't. Never mind. I ran into the people who made that list, Claire and Scott, on Sunday evening - which was nice - and it turns out that Scott will be giving a talk at the Mitre in Greenwich (round the corner from St. Alfege's, opposite the cinema) under the aegis of the South East London Folklore Society:  Scott Wood - The Angels of Mons and Elsewhere. Believers say that angels saved the British army during the retreat at Mons in 1914. Skeptics have always insisted that the angels of Mons were a delusion based on a fictional story. Scott disagrees with all of them. This talk starts with paranormal phenomena, goes through history and ends in folklore.

       urlLink     Traditionally, the method of learning Chinese calligraphy has two main elements: one is to train technical skills, the other is to train the mind. Once they complement each other, it is thought a student will arrive at a higher level of the art of calligraphy. The former element is about the physical, i.e. exercising the muscles to develop one’s expressiveness, based upon the correct motions of writing developed with long practice, which matures with age. This could be seen in Western terms, as related to Baudelaire’s comment: "the grandiloquent truth of gestures on life’s great occasions. (Baudelaire in Barthes, 1957)" Learning calligraphy is like learning Chinese boxing, it is a matter of developing the correct writing techniques through the practice of the muscles of the fingers, wrist, arm, elbow and the waist. So, it is said without determined practice it is very difficult to emulate good handwriting. The latter element is about personal accomplishment and self-cultivation, which can be divided into moral standing and knowledge. According to the Chinese ancients, if ‘a person has no grand moral character, the writing has no splendor’. In calligraphic thought this means that one can not depart from one’s times, violate nature, desert life, disobey one’s country and one’s society, but be full of the substance and beauty of life.

      Further to yesterday's link ramblings, I should certainly take a good long look at Claire Harrison's paper at First Monday urlLink Whither Thou Goest, And Why :  The question then arises: Is it actually possible to create a hypertext that is not idiosyncratic in some manner? I suggest that it is not. Whether a site contains pages and/or databases, the decision regarding what is to be included is always based on human choice which is inherently idiosyncratic. For example, let us say that a government database includes the biographies of all elected politicians. Not only has someone decided that such information should be on the site, the biographies themselves are tainted, so to speak, by the writer(s) who have decided what information should or should not be included in them. Even simple facts can pose difficulties. Say, the government database also included a link to all votes by elected politicians within a given Congress. The "yeas" and "nays" are facts, but such facts are only the foundation of interpretation, discussion, and/or argument for which they require context. Yet, the minute the user can link to contextual information, e.g., the politics of the day, the dynamics of the particular Congress, each politician's political affiliation, and so forth, the information is once again "tainted." As Nelson (1999) noted, "'Information,' referred to as a commodity, is a myth. Information always comes in packages ... and every such package has a point of view. Even a database has a point of view."

       Cluster Analysis  Okay then: theorise, if you will, a downloadable script that crawls your blogroll, and the blogrolls of those blogs, and cross-refers the lists to produce:   Affinity groups of blogs with fully interconnecting mutual linkage  Recommendations for the home blog (blogs to which associates mutually link in significant numbers - sorry to say I've been too diverted to unearth any examples of this just yet. I've been putting it off because  my discoveries will necessarily and by design be places I'll probably be keen to explore...)   Recommendations for others (blogs which are interlinked with the tight clusters, which do not link to one another, reciprocally or maybe at all, which may well repay specific a specific heads up. As a gratuitous example: according to this afternoons brief investigations, I think  urlLink Jeff Ward  should check out  urlLink Plep , if he hasn't already. I don't think Plep is in Jeff's blogroll, but along with this blog, plep is mutually linked by  urlLink abuddhas memes ,  urlLink riley dog , and  urlLink wood s lot , all of which are mutually linked with  urlLink Visible Darkness ...  Quantify non-reciprocal linkage - sites with enormous inward linking and little or no outward linking don't really feature in this model. (Sites without blogrolls can't play? Discuss...)  Now for the trippy part:  Geodesic mapping of one's blog neighbourhood... if lots of people held this data in a particular format in their source code, and some kind soul put together a flight sim doodad, you could navigate through a self-organised blogspace visualising  mutually endorsed 'kinship'.  I'm a little unclear how much complexity (degrees of separation) a simulator might currently be able to deal with (I'm not much of a gameplayer, at least not computer games, so I don't know) You could perch on a blog and see the neighbourhood - threads of linkage extended to... well, you can visualise it any way you fancy.  Use some pretty basic spatial algorithms to govern the space: the more mutual linkage that occurs, for example, the larger the blog's signifier might  loom in the local linkscape.   Perhaps the flight agent can learn about thematically (even emotionally or psychologically) related nexuses...? nexi...? (ah, simply  urlLink nexus  - bottom of page) and report back to a giant pulsating portal brain at the centre of the blogiverse, which can help direct the traffic. Or not.  Blogspace??? Blogiverse??? Linkscape??? wtf is happening to me?  Perhaps a system to id every outward link, so that every inward referral is announced to the  page's local map. This, I realise, is probably what Trackback does, but I'm not far enough into my MT installation to have studied it (I know, I'm being really slow about it, but other things keep cropping up. The world's going mental. What are you gonna do?)  This has probably all been said before. I'm sure I can't be the first person to have put these few bits together, but I haven't seen it  done  yet. Herewith my offering to the lazyweb. What about it? More crazed scribblings on this subject before too long, perhaps...

      Want to fritter away a pleasant afternoon, and drive yourself close to the brink of insanity while you're about it? Here's a little game you can play:   make a list of all the blogs with whom you are mutually linked. (Enthusiasm has 24 of these)   check out everyone's blogroll, and find who among them is mutually linked to whom   it might help to begin by disregarding mutual links of yours that don't link to anyone else in your roll...   You come up with a strange crystalline structure in your head, in which one or more groups of blogs are interconnected by mutual linkage. There will others who link partially to those groups. These are bloggers for whom introductions and specific recommendations could be made. Make a note of these.   There may also be blogs who are mutually linked by members of your groups which you don't link, or maybe have never noticed before. These are interesting blogs; make a note of these, too.    things get quite quickly out of hand. You start wishing you had a little script to automate some of this blogroll-crawling. You start to wonder how that script would work, and how to present its findings... then you realise you are, um, well, agitated...

       For the second time in less than a week, I find myself mourning the death of someone I never actually met. Rick Gleason, a friend of Chris Kovacs (better known to the blog world as  urlLink Stavros The Wonderchicken ) was seriously injured in the Bali bombing, but for a while it looked like he was going to pull through. I just heard that he didn't. My condolences to Chris, to Rick's  family, and to those who knew him...

      Ah, developments. It looks very much as if this site will be moving to a new server over the next couple of days, and I'll be migrating the blog more or less immediately to  urlLink MT . I haven't looked deeply into the migration plan yet, but I'm hoping I'lll be able to fix some of the structural problems standing in the way of validation at the same time (I did  not  fancy the idea of manually fixing all the image tags just so I can stick a little icon at the bottom of the page, not even  urlLink Antipixel's nice new versions ) We may experience some turbulence...

      I slept for a long time last night, stumbled out of bed not that long ago... SMS about earthquakes in Manchester (didn't that happen already?) and rewound the VCR. C4 repeated a documentary/interview with Alan Moore at some ridiculous hour of the night. Anyway I started watching it before I'd even revived myself with my morning pot of tea. This would be a really bad idea for almost any activity  except  getting a nudge in the ribs from a magus:    Magick has quote a lot in common with fiction and with fantasy. We almost get to the notion that the two are pretty well interchangeable. I think Aleister Crowley mentions that the language of magick is more about language than it is about magick. The idea of a grimoire, a dark book of spells - grimoire is just another way of spelling grammar. According to Crowley, to cast a spell is simply, 'to spell'. When we think of the fact that most of the magick gods that various cultures have created or worshipped in the past - characters like Mercury, Hermes, Thoth - these are not only the gods of magick, they are also the scribe gods, the gods of writing. To some degree, the reason I involve myself with magick is that partly as a writer I was feeling that something to do with the territory of writing itself, the way that anyone who has been writing for a given length of time will have anecdotes to tell you, strange little coincidences, things that they wrote and then something very similar happened to them, perhaps a day, perhaps a month, perhaps ten years later. There are these odd little incidents that tend to build up that you tend to shove in a filing drawer just marked 'weird stuff' and eventually, as with myself, you might reach a point where you decide that the stuff in the drawer marked weird stuff is in fact the only  important stuff, and that if you wish to progress as a writer beyond mere technique, you might be advised to start looking at some of those events...

       urlLink  BRmovie.com - The Home of Blade Runner  An entire, multithreaded blog-formatted site devoted to a single movie? Sure, why not? I did have a factoid in the back of my mind, however, which this site was unable to confirm for me. I ran into an old college friend of mine in Holborn a couple of years (at most) after the movie was released, and he claimed to be responsible for the origami figures 'made' by Gaff. It was a plausible claim, as it happens - but despite a lengthy credit list - far lengthier than the one at the end of the movie itself - no-one is specifically credited with making the origami figures. The mystery endures... (via  urlLink consumptive )

      I'm really not sure how I should best describe what I've noticed on the ether today - some kind of memetic knot, perhaps.  It started with a portmanteau post on  urlLink MeFi , collecting a bunch of links pertaining to Mongolia, which included the page on  urlLink  Mongolian script  at  urlLink Omniglot  - which was also pointed to by a Cyberminder this morning, although I couldn't find the exact reference just now when I went to look. The Omniglot site is a pretty comprehensive overview of the world's writing systems, with lots of rather attractive samples of exotic alphabets, and amongst other things, the story of the Tower of Babel in forty three different languages - including some which render entirely as question marks in my browser, unfortunately, although there are a few exotic fonts for download, including traditional Mongolian...)  And then  urlLink The New York Review of Books: The Religious Success Story , which considers the ubiquity of religious practice throughout all human cultures, and wonders about the point of it all, tells the Babel story according to the tiny Sikari tribe of New Guinea. It's a brilliant version, involving the catapulting of a fugitive muderer and his relatives into the far distance, having been chased up a tree... I suppose it's the way they tell it.

       urlLink  Autumnal Tints  Henry David Thoreau, writing of autumn in Massachusetts, from the archives of The Atlantic.  Generally, every fruit, on ripening, and just before it falls, when it commences a more independent and individual existence, requiring less nourishment from any source, and that not so much from the earth through its stem as from the sun and air, acquires a bright tint. So do leaves. The physiologist says it is "due to an increased absorption of oxygen." That is the scientific account of the matter,—only a reassertion of the fact. But I am more interested in the rosy cheek than I am to know what particular diet the maiden fed on. The very forest and herbage, the pellicle of the earth, must acquire a bright color, an evidence of its ripeness,—as if the globe itself were a fruit on its stem, with ever a cheek toward the sun.

       urlLink Mark Wood  has a clutch of links this morning on the subject of enthusiasm. It's a word with a complex and fascinating history, as suggested by the succession of meanings given in the definition that sits beneath the blogroll over there in the navigation column.  Prior to the eighteenth century, the word stood for something like religious frenzy, inspired by a (supposed) divine revelation. In this sense, an enthusiast was considered someone dangerously unhinged, a loose cannon, a public order crisis-in-waiting. During the transition into the Romantic period, however, the word acquired a secular meaning, denoting the motive force of poetic creativity - and the boundaries and distinctions between the two senses were jealously guarded (from the religious side of the argument, at least). The most substantial of Mark's references, and the richest source of quotes on the subject, is an article by Jon Mee from   urlLink Romanticism On The Net 25 (February 2002)  , entitled  urlLink Mopping Up Spilt Religion: The Problem of Enthusiasm   'By 1735, the Gentleman's Magazine could publish a definition of enthusiasm in terms of "any exorbitant monstrous Appetite of the human Mind"... Two years later, the same magazine reported a parliamentary speech confirming that "the lowest Class of People [...] have, generally speaking a turn to Enthusiasm, and so strong is the Influence, such is the force of Delusion, that they can work themselves up to a firm Persuasion and thorough belief that any Mischief they are able to do, is not only lawful but laudable"...For the Romantic period, whether in its religious or secular forms, enthusiasm remained dangerously intertwined with the idea of the being transported into the amorphous and unstable hyper-sociability of the crowd.'

       urlLink Evolution and Literary Criticism  A most interesting article which appears to call for a Darwinian literary analysis.  Although most scholars give lip service to the merits of "interdisciplinary" study, all too often such efforts are only celebrated when they involve poaching on another discipline's preserve. Thus, current literary criticism seems eager to "deconstruct the texts" of natural and social scientists, while considering their own domain sacrosanct. What about some traffic in the other direction, all the while fully admitting that evolutionary insights will not exhaust the rich body of human literary imaginings, any more than the science of optics contains all that might be said about sunsets? We come to expand and enhance literary criticism, not to limit it.

What follows is a little impoverished, linkwise, for which even more apologies... Okay, Megalithomania report. I caught eight of the presentations, but missed the evening's music and film screenings. What I did see amounted to a broad introduction to a range of viewpoints on mindfully marking the landscape with stones, monuments, power spots, boundaries and alignments. Andy Letcher spoke of the relationship between paganism and protest culture, specifically  urlLink environmental ,  urlLink anti-road protests .   Rob Stephenson gave a lightning run-through of myth and legend surrounding the early history of London (I'll be unpacking the notes from his talk very carefully over several days, lest they detonate an information explosion in my head that would take over my entire life).  After lunch, Leslie Ellen Jones gave a most amusing account of the strange uses to which the film and televison business have made over the years, which rather underlined the wildly divergent, sometimes nonsensical interpretations which inform some understanding of megaliths. Followed by a supporting program of cheesy film clips, the cheesiest of which by far was  urlLink Psychomania!   Alan Walker spoke of Christian stonework, and the inscription of parish boundary markers in London, which might make an interesting psychogeography project for someone.  Robert Wallis described the fraught relationship between the conflicting cultures of Engliish Heritage (the Quango in charge of management of historic and prehistoric sites in general, and the pagan communities who actually use certain sites for their ritual observances, some of which bear scant resemblance to the sombre repressed devotions of High C of E., which brings a whole other set of problems.  Then Iain Sinclair described an arc of London's Orbital From the intersection of the Greenwich meridian around to Shenley, where Nicholas Hawksmoor is buried. There may be an excerpt from the book knocking about somewhere. Paul Devereux showed a bewildering variety of sacred sites, to a greater or lesser extent transforming the landscape and defining vantage points from which communication with the infinite, giving example of sites which replicate folk memory of the original High Places.  Then it was tea time, and I went home.

       urlLink  Donnie Darko  looks like my kind of movie. the official site is a tasty piece of flash work. Better than tasty, actually, its running in another window as I write, and it keeps getting better... This is from the  urlLink Sight and Sound review :  Kelly describes it as the soul of the movie, based on a completely inconsequential but similar moment in his own life that he never quite forgot, when he and a woman he never met waved to each other from passing cars. And so at his film's very end one character waves mournfully to another from across a street. The two people don't know each other at all at this point, and perhaps they never will because the character that connected them in another timeline has just died. The wave is a phantom of that other-time connection, one they feel numbly compelled to make.

       urlLink   Years and years ago, as a Fine Art student in Coventry, I attempted to give a seminar on  The Glass Bead Game , and the relation between the studies of the game, as envisioned by Hesse, and contemporary art practice. There were probably a couple of dozen people in attendance, and not a single one of them had read the goddamn book, which left me in the unenviable position of struggling uphill, trying to explain the book, whilst the assembled company grumbled at details as I went along. Since then I've always felt pathetically grateful and indulgent towards almost anyone who's even heard of it.  urlLink HipBone Games  however, takes the work a whole lot further, devising playable versions of the game, and linking extensive resources on the game, what it has to teach about game design in general, and most strikingly, how it helps understand the nature of cyberspace.  I foresee losing quite a lot of hours in here...  (via Robot Wisdom)

       urlLink Death of an idea  Julian Baggini steps up to bang another nail in the coffin of postmodernism. As these things go, it's a very similar argument to the ones advanced a year ago, and reviewed by  urlLink Stanley Fish  in the New York Times. I don't find it anymore convincing now than I did then. Surely postmodernism is being misrepresented when it is accused of actually denying the existence of "objective" reality? If I understand correctly, the existence of an objective reality is not really (heh!) in dispute - only the belief in the attainability of a single authoritative and exhaustive model of that reality. What's that Karl Popper word? Verisimilitude. That's the one. All of our understandings, or mappings of reality are culturally derived, and more fundamentally, contingent on the particular sensory and cognitive apparatus with which we are equipped. A good map is one that helps us get to where we want to go. A map that works. "Truth", or verisimilitude, only becomes an issue as and when the map fails. Wherupon the map may be revised - but the new map is more "true" only to the extent that it is more "useful"...  (via  urlLink Phil & Lit )

I don't watch too many ninja movies, but this I understand has established itself on the landscape, and it's not hard to see why. For a movie with so much violent death, it's remarkably peaceful and meditative. Forest Whitaker rocks the house with a laconic, thoughtful script. I do furrow my brows a little over the fetishistic caressing of powerful and lethal weapons, but the gore is pretty restrained - I was struck by the scene where Ghost Dog presents his best friend the Ice Cream Vendor with a suit he had been wearing for a full-on gun battle in the previous scene, and there isn't a  wrinkle  in the suit (which is kind of spelling it out, really).... A worthy if cartoonish attempt at a Zen fairy tale in film, and you don't get too many of those lately...

       Sarah came home today with a copy of  urlLink The Complete Clangers Series 1 , among other fine things. Two hours of bliss, with a charming synchronicity thrown in.  The case gave an address for an official  urlLink Clangers  site, which is kind of primitive, but I cannot fault the content of the site, which has a great deal more to it than the official   urlLink Oliver Postgate  site, which is terribly sparse. The Clangers site  includes a bizarre story from the pre-production of the first series:   Rather nervously I asked Ursula Eason of the BBC what they objected to in the scripts. She replied: "The bad language."  I could only think of one piece of bad language. One of the episodes begins with Major Clanger trying to open the big sliding doors of the main cave mouth. It jams and his first line is:  "Oh sod it! The bloody thing's stuck again!"  "That's it." said Ursula. "You know quite well we can't say things like that on childrens' programmes."  "But .. " I said, "they don't say it. They whistle it."  "But surely people will know?"  "If they have nice minds they will hear him say 'Oh dear me. The naughty thing is jammed again.'"  "Oh, all right then, I suppose so, but please keep the language moderate."

The right to protection from unlawful searches is an indivisible American value. Two hundred years of court decisions have stood in defense of this fundamental right. The state's interest in effective crime-fighting should never vitiate the citizens' Bill of Rights. Senator John Ashcroft, October 1997.

       urlLink    I'm not 100% sure about this, but it may be that his being dead was the first I ever  heard of Bill Hicks. Probably the first time I  saw  any of his work would have been about a year ago, out in Wales, when I mentioned that I'd never seen anything by him, and I was escorted rather smartly to the nearest VCR. What I saw filled me with the sort of admiration I hadn't felt about a standup comic since I discovered Lenny Bruce, and that was twenty five years ago. Anyway, I happened to find a little cache of MP3s of his work a few days ago, and I downloaded a bunch of them, and suddenly there he is on the cover of the Guardian's TV Guide on Saturday - a  urlLink devotional piece  by Andrew Mueller, and I gather there's a couple of new CDs coming out. I freely admit that I'm not qualified to be writing any tributes to Bill Hicks, and you probably were into him before I was. That wouldn't be hard. But if you're even more new to Bill than I am, I suggest you have a squint at the tribute linked up at the top, and the Guardian piece, and root around for more.

       urlLink  new books: Surrealist Subversions   From its auspicious beginnings in the summer of 1966 to the present, the Chicago Surrealist Group -- and the Surrealist Movement in the United States, which grew out of it -- have continued to foment an exhilarating whirlwind of revolt while playfully igniting the sparks of Poetry, Freedom and Love in the crucible of the Unfettered Imagination. In so doing, it has brightly illuminated the pathways of absolute divergence that define the intrinsically anarchist trajectory of the surrealist adventure. Drawing on the full range of U.S. surrealist publications, from the original journal Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion to the very latest millennial communiques from the front lines of the ongoing battle against miserabilism, this volume contains over 200 texts (many appearing here for the first time) by more than fifty participants in the Surrealist Movement, making this the most comprehensive, diverse and lavishly illustrated compilation of American surrealist writings ever to be assembled.

I wish I could scan the smell of them for you. These mushrooms turn into an unappetising black goop rather quickly, and although they remain  urlLink edible  until they begin to blacken and liquefy, they are really good when the gills are still pale and the caps relatively unopened, like these. Even better, I found them only three minutes' walk away from here, and there's more coming!  Now that's much better than a scan of my poor, injured, still throbbing finger would have been, don't you think? UPDATE: I cooked the mushrooms in butter with garlic and parsley. Like many wild mushrooms, they gave off a good quantity of liquid, so I let them simmer away for rather longer than I would usually cook mushrooms, so the liquor reduced. Then stirred in beaten eggs and black pepper to make an omelette of it all. The ink caps had a pleasant, delicate flavour, quite nutty, rather like almonds in fact, which nevertheless lingers almost an hour after I've eaten the dish. Of course I had no sooner eaten my wild mushroom omelette than I succumbed to Wild Mushroom Anxiety. I become briefly convinced that I have made a fatal error of identification, and that I am about to die a horrible and lingering toxic death. I get this  every goddamn time  I have wild fungus to eat - at least, every time I try a new species, or from a new source. Then I forget all about it until the next time...sigh.

      It's been a busy day. We've moved Sarah from Willesden, which is north west London, over to Forest Hill, which is fifteen minutes' walk down the road from here in the south east. It all went swimmingly, except that when we arrived at the new place, your humble narrator tried to open a sash  window. I slipped the catch, and the top half of the window - controversially not equipped with the ropes and counterweights that make sash windows actually  work  - crashed down on the middle two fingers of my left hand like a guillotine. Fortunately it only caught the fingers on the nails - and if you ever whacked your fingernail with a hammer, you'll have some idea what that felt like. I wasn't what you would call  conversational  for quite a while. There followed a miraculously brief visit to the hospital - I think we were in and out of there within about half an hour, which these days is absolutely unheard of. The receptionist told Sarah while I was getting treatment that they'd dealt with all the saturday night injuries by that point, except for the ones who had yet to wake up and decide that they needed medical attention, so my little accident was perfectly timed to avoid the rush. My left hand ring finger is throbbing like something out of a Tom & Jerry cartoon, but here I am, actually typing with it, so I expect I'll be fine in a day or two...

      Public Service Announcement: just in case you haven't seen  urlLink The Lost Boys  (1987), directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Richard Donner, and starring Keifer Sutherland, a word of advice: don't waste your time/money. I hadn't seen it until the night before last, and since there was a copy lying around, we gave it a try. Oh dear... I realise there are a million worse movies out there, but they're usually pretty easy to spot. This one should have been, at worst, mindlessly entertaining, something like Katherine Bigelow's  urlLink Near Dark   - but it was  atrocious . It's far, far worse than you expect. I spent the whole 95 minutes trying to figure out a point of view from which it might have some merit, and came up with nothing. S. says I obviously don't fancy Keifer, and that explains it. Well, we both knew I didn't fancy Keifer before I suggested looking at the movie, but I didn't hear about this being the only reason to watch the thing back then...

       urlLink Brewster Kahle interview  The Wayback Machine man talks to New Scientist. The ground covered is pretty basic, but we shouldn't neglect the basics, should we?  Websites are like shifting sands. The average life of a Web page is 100 days. After that either it's changed or it disappears. So our intellectual society is built on sand. You can't hold people accountable if, say, the promises posted on the Web by politicians are not available after the election. And key academic papers can become unavailable if a researcher leaves a university and their website is deleted. We've found that many websites of publicly funded projects disappear within a year. So as taxpayers we are investing in research projects, but we're not investing in a Web library that organises them and gives future generations access.

       urlLink Guardian Unlimited Film | Interviews | Michael Moore  This interview is dated 11th November. I'm not sure how I missed it until now, but I'm very glad I didn't miss it completely.  I think they're very afraid of this film - they've been afraid of it since Cannes and they've been trying to figure out how to control it. Because it's not a gun control movie - this is a movie which says that something is more seriously and deeply wrong with the USA and our gun problem is a symptom of the larger illness that exists. Charlton Heston said in this interview with me, with no prompting from me, that the problem with America is "our mixed ethnicity". I'd asked a question about why Canadians don't have as many gun murders as we do and he said he was very proud that our country had been invented by those wise and dead white guys. And he kept making these kind of racial comments, but then he'd back off from them when I repeated the question to him. People were very afraid as to how that was going to come across. I don't know why anybody would feel sorry for a guy who leads the most powerful lobby group in the US and whose sole purpose is to make sure that people can have as many guns as they want to have and fire as many bullets as the guns can possibly fire. These people are insane and they have to be stopped.

       urlLink Mark Pilgrim has come up with a cute web application  called  urlLink New Door , which will examine your blog page and compile a list of twenty recommendations for other pages you may or may not already be reading. It's based on data from Philip Pearson's blogging ecosystem, and you'd be much better off reading Mark's  urlLink description  of it than bothering with any cack-handed summary I might attempt. Here are the first-pass  urlLink results  for enthusiasm.  It may prove unwieldy to make such an involved refinement, but: could version 2.0 automatically skip blogs that are already linked from the page being examined? Eight of my original twenty are already in my blogroll, and it took no less than 24 individual, manual exclusions to arrive at a list which contained no blogs to which I don't already link. I might add that unless and until I provide an RSS feed of this blog, enthusiasm will never show up in anyone's list of recommendations, which I think is a bit rough; I see the value of RSS in general terms, but enthusiasm is a weblog, not a stockticker, nor a news feed. I don't think that someone readiing enthusiasm through a news aggregator would really be "getting it" - as I suggested in the case of  urlLink ikastikos , a  urlLink couple of days ago .  I must say that the list of twenty blogs I ended up with - which has the longest URL I have ever seen, and I've seen more than a few - only two or three are actually new to me, but one of them -  urlLink greg.org  - is so far up my street that it goes straight into the roll, and makes the whole exercise worthwhile, and I've been nudged into adding  urlLink Kevin Marks  as well, which I kind of suspected I ought to do all along.  I might as well take the opportunity to raise issues I have with the  urlLink blogging ecosystem  itself. I realise I'm probably still off the radar, as far as the top 500 goes, but enthusiasm is mutually permalinked to at least ten of the current 500, but when I look at the stats for each of these sites, this blog is not listed either as linking to or from them - whereas if I look at the cached copy of each of these pages, there I am, large as life. What's going on? I'll drop the archive URL to this post into PP's mail basket when it's posted, and report back any response I get. I'm not paranoid enough to think that enthusiasm is the only blog which is disappearing from the ecosystem's map in this way.

For most of that time, being an Everton supporter has been nothing much to shout about, but lately we've been doing rather well; for the first time in living memory we have an honest to goodness wild-eyed zealot for a manager, in David Moyes; Everton managers have traditionally been of the suit and tie persuasion.

We're fourth in the Premiership right now, we've won our last five Premiership matches, and we're three points ahead of Manchester freaking United. It's all rather disconcerting. We'll be competing in Europe next season if we're not careful. So why did I wake from a turbulent, repetitious dream last night in which midfielder and Irish international Lee Carsley scored a hat trick of own goals and was promptly sold, like the same day, to Dunfermline Athletic?

It's a nice little mind-bender of an article, but surely we've been through enough paradigm shifts by now to realise that the universe-as-information analogy is almost certainly no more fixed and absolute than the old universe-as-clockwork-mechanism analogy was in Newton's time? The crucial paragraphs appear to be these:  Any large computer these days can emulate a computer of some other design. You have Dell computers running Amigas. The Amigas, could, if anyone wanted them to, run Commodores. There is no end to how many nested worlds can be built. So imagine what a universal computer might do. If you had a universally equivalent engine, you could pop it in anywhere, including inside the inside of something else. And if you had a universe-sized computer, it could run all kinds of recursive worlds; it could, for instance, simulate an entire galaxy.

       urlLink   What happened was this: a week ago, I checked out a perfectly innocent astronomy picture, showing a rather sweet  urlLink nebula  (hi res version  urlLink here ) in the constellation of Ophiuchus, and thought no more about it. Then a few hours later, while reading  The Subtle Knife , a minor character points towards the constellation, indicating a flight of angels hurtling across the sky, and the witch Ruta Skadi takes off in pursuit.  Oh-oh: dig in the ribs time again. Agenbite of inwit. Mindful of  urlLink Alan Moore's remarks  concerning weird stuff, I also took off in pursuit, and what I've dug up spreads out in many interesting directions, although some of the online sources I've visited verge on the bonkers, so,  caveat lector , innit.  Ophiuchus (pronounced OFF-ee-OO-kuss), as it turns out, is quite a large  urlLink constellation  on the ecliptic, between Scorpio and Sagittarius. The name means "snake handler" and the two parts of the constellation  urlLink Serpens  are arranged about him. It happens also to lie in the direction of the  urlLink galactic centre .  Ophiuchus is the only constellation on the ecliptic which is not also a sign of the astrological zodiac - because the plane of the ecliptic has shifted since the establishment of the astrological zodiac. Some people consider that this somehow invalidates astrology, although I would contend that this indicates a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of astrology. Still, we can get onto that in a later episode, perhaps...  urlLink This page  is about the most comprehensive summary of both astrological and mythological data, and also the source for the illustration I've used at the top there. An older image from the Ophiuchus constellation at  urlLink APOD  shows massive swirls of cloud known as the  urlLink Snake Nebula  - presumably because of their location, rather than through any particular resemblance to a snake. The mythical Ophiuchus is identified by most sources as  urlLink Asclepius , Master Architect, Healer, and God of Wisdom - but mostly healing: he has five daughters, at least two of whom,  urlLink Hygieia  and Panacea, lend their names to medical concepts, and two sons, who don't. O-okay.   The  urlLink life story of Asclepius  is complicated (isn't it always with these Olympians?). Asclepius is the child of Apollo by Coronis. Apollo has Coronis killed for supposed infidelity with the mortal Ischys, but is filled with remorse and he gets Hermes to tear the unborn Asclepius from his dead mother's womb on the funeral pyre. The child is given into the charge of the Yoda--like Chiron, the Centaur, whose wisdom is said to be greater than that of all the other Olympian deities put together. Chiron teaches him healing, and his skill becomes so great that he is reputedly able to revive the dead. He is enlisted as ships surgeon for the voyage of the Argo. He restores Glaucon, the son of King Minos of Crete, to life following a chariot accident, and a number of others, which eventually causes some consternation in Hades, where the ruler of the underworld  complains that if humans are able to cheat death, his dominion - I almost said livelihood - is threatened. He prevails on Zeus to break out the thunderbolts, and Asclepius is killed while attemting to revive Orion, who has been killled while hunting. However in recognition of the benefit he has brought to humankind, the healer is placed in the sky as Ophiuchus, along with his snake. But there's more. Oh  boy, is there more...

I  can't  be the first person to have made this analogy, surely? I don't recall having seen it written anywhere before though... UPDATE: No, of course I wasn't the first person to make the blogging / punk analogy. Here's a dude called Dr Frank, writing in  urlLink The Blogs of War  - which I've never seen before - last December:  In many ways the weblog phenomenon is a lot like the often unrealized ideal of punk rock, which is that everyone has a band, and all the members of all the bands are in the audience when they don't happen to be on the stage. There is an absolute equality of opportunity, yet it's also a true meritocracy since the ones with the most appealing or interesting content get the most attention; and there's very little subversion of this meritocracy, very little incentive for people to pander to the lowest common denominator to increase "market share", since the financial angle, if it's there at all, is minimal at best. At least, that's the ideal."

       urlLink BBC NEWS | Scotland | 25-year murder conviction quashed  How exactly do you compensate someone for the loss of all of his 20s and 30s and half of his 40s? The guy is a year older than me. He's been in jail since the Sex Pistols were in the charts. Expect some hullabaloo over compensation, though. What's possibly even more sickening is that the guy was refused parole for the last ten years because he refused to give up trying to clear his name. And the Manchester police have said they "did not rule out" the possibility of reopening the case. Strangely (or predictably, perhaps) there is no suggestion in this article that the police officers who coerced Robert Brown into signing a false confession will be brought to justice. That would be a start, wouldn't it?

       urlLink  These chimps are fishing for ants... but does this ritual make them cultured?  A large and growing body of research shows that chimpanzees have quite a rich and varied culture, which carries implications, so they say, for conservation policy. It's another step in a slow awakening; it isn't all that long ago that Learned Societies considered culture to be the sole preserve of, ahem, People Like Us (meaning property owning white christian folk). Gradually the realisation dawned that other people had cultural agendas too, and "we" might have to take these into account.  Of course there are still people who disagree with this; I had the dubious pleasure of seeing a  urlLink documentary  about one, only a week ago, during the course of which the University of Leeds awarded a  degree  to the stupid fucker. Go figure.  And again, having a culture isn't going to stop George Bush dropping bombs on you and stealing your oil, either. Sorry, Iraqis. I have to conclude that merely prodding a few somnolent academics into a grudging recognition that you have a culture isn't necessarily going to save you from extinction. Sorry about that, chimps...

       urlLink Pepys’ Diary  is to be published a day at a time in blog format! Whoohooo! Samuel Pepys, in case you didn't know, was a civil servant in 17th Century London who kept an exceptionally vivid and entertaining diary for 10 years, between 1659 and 1669, never intended for publication, but which became a principal source for historians of the Restoration. The decade covered by the diary included the Great Plague of 1665, and the Fire of London the following year, and because of his occupation, he was able to give an account of historical events as an insider - and of course it did no harm that he counted Isaac Newton and Christopher Wren amongst his homiez. Anyway, Sam becomes Emeritus Blogrollee around these parts... (via  urlLink leuschke )

      Lightning bloggage again: I ventured into the West End today - I certainly wouldn't ordinarily do such a thing on the last weekend before xmas, but I was seeing off my beloved to Newcastle for the next few days, and I wanted to get a component that would reduce my stress quite a bit. For however long it is, I've been using an external USB hub with its own power supply, which despite being upstream of a surge-protected box, would momentarily drop all of it's connections when the fridge switched itself on. Not  every  time, just often enough to cause my computer activity to be suspended by a minute or so, while the hub remembered it had in fact  been  a hub, once upon a time, and decided to take it up again. Meanwhile the G4 had decided that my USB audio devices were no longer obtainable, and reverted to the internal ones, and these had to be reset manually, twice or three times in a day. Gets to you after a while. I had considered building a script that would restore the audio settings onclick, but it was a preposterous thing to have to do. Instead I bought a new component, endured the befuddling nonsense of non-liability on the grounds of it not saying suitable for Macintosh clearly on the side of the box. I mean, a PCI card is a PCI card, isn't it? Why would it not work, specifically? No-one was very keen to discuss it. I brought home the card, I stuck it in the G4 and it works. And he saw that it was good, which is more than can be said for the grey miasma of hysteria and carnage that was Oxford Street, seen from the Tottenham Court Road end, at about three o'clock this afternoon. The magic of xmas hung over the scene like a toxic cloud. Time for a shower, and then, more enjoyment!

Judging from the tag-line I evidently put up when I did, it must have been quite early this year, at the latest. And this is my second referral from there, according to them. Which suggests that in this case at least, having a presence on a blog portal is a lot less significant than being linked by a blog or two of good standing in what is uncertainly called the community.

      It's nearly ten o'clock, and I'm flying in one metaphorical door only to fly out the other: I've been having a little drink at my local and for the first time this year the festive cheer has sliightly got to me.. But I heard a story this evening that nudged me into remembering something I saw on somebody's blog a few days ago, and which has been rolling around in my mind ever since. It essentially said, there is someone watching you. there is always someone depending on you, learning from you, taking from you, and you may never know about it. So you  must not  sell yourself short.  The story that made me think of this again is the story of a very dear friend of mine who works as a psychiatric nurse. A few days ago he was going about the secure wards where some particularly scary patients are, in the current parlance, "cared for". A dude came out of his space with a box blasting a particularly fetching piece of dub, and my friend recognised it, because I had played it to him regularly over the last several years. And there they were, dangerous psychiatric patient and nurse, rocking steady to the Sly and Robbie digital dub mix of Slaughter by  urlLink Black Uhuru  (and I wish I was packing the bandwidth to MPthree you up, here) and when the tune was done, where hitherto there had been the most disturbing and fearsome grimace, there was a raised fist - Jah! Ras Tafari! - I thought you were going to punch me, said my friend, and there was a broad grin. Music can be powerful medicine.  One more day to go, and then, the holidays. For some reason, this year, I feel up for it.

      I see that the second Lord of the Rings movie is in the cinemas from today. I definitely wouldn't have been so interested in this, had I not seen the first one, only last night, in the extended DVD version (with extra features hand-crafted by dwarves, if I interpret the TV trailers correctly). I expect anyone who is interested in this is already well aware, but the Fellowship of the Ring, the first episode, rocks like a... well, what does it rock like? The CG effects are very, very nearly flawless. The casting is superb. The battle scenes are just extraordinary. I haven't read the book in more than twenty five years, and yet it took me right back into it, to the extent that I was able to ask, "So was that the Balrog, that the orcs were cooking up in that vat of excrement, or whatever it was?" just as if I knew what I was talking about.

       A few days ago I promised to explain Menzies as my suggested middle name for the forthcoming Cameron Turner . William Cameron Menzies (1896-1957). His  urlLink IMDb reference  page makes very interesting reading: many more credits as a production designer than as a director. According to Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia, Menzies was th first person ever to be credited as a Production Designer on a movie, and frequently had a much greater influence on the look of a film than the director, since the responsibility extended into costume and special effects.  The lead comment on  urlLink Things To Come  (1936) declares that it was the beginning of the 'Intellectual Cinema' anticipated by Eisenstein, and the only recommended viewing suggested in connection with it is Kubrick's   urlLink A Clockwork Orange  (1971). Menzies also co-wrote a screenplay, with Joe Mankiewitz, of a 1933 version of  urlLink Alice in Wonderland  which I've never seen. He was second unit director (as well as production designer) for  urlLink Gone With The Wind  (1939) - which is to say he was responsible for most of the good things about that movie. And he is all over the 1940 version of  urlLink Thief of Baghdad  (1940), as uncredited director, associate producer and associate art director, amongst others. It was his second crack at this - he had been art director on the 1924  urlLink Roaul Walsh / Douglas Fairbanks Sr. version , too. Aside: have you noticed how web searches for poets, authors and visual artists, the chances are you're going to find something reasonably to the point, whereas if you're looking for film directors, actors and more obvious Celebrities, you find nothing but commercial crap?

Fifteen minutes later I printed out a copy of this montage I'd thrown together, and pinned it on the wall to inspire the colleagues. I don't think that was quite what he had in mind, but still...

        There are coots on the canal. My knowledge of birds is rather patchy, but the one thing I had managed to absorb about coots, along with how to recognize them, is that they are quarrelsome little fuckers. Well, this afternoon - just after dark, I nipped out the back of the office for a smoke, and there were three coots in the water: two males, fighting, one female, egging them on, and a supporting cast of ducks looking on, appalled. The fighting had already started when I arrived, and it was still going on when I finished my cigarette and it was far too cold to hang around and watch anymore. I've found a few pages describing this deplorable behaviour, the best of which is  urlLink here . It describes American Coots, which look a little different about the upper beak to the local variety, but the fighting I saw was very much like the description. There's also a pretty  good picture of coots fighting  urlLink here , but it didn't reduce terribly well, so I used a more placid illustration.   UPDATE: I've just been telling Sarah about this episode over the phone, and she advises me that one of Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons books was called Coots, or something like it, and sure enough, here's a 1935 dustcover of Coot Club from  urlLink here .

      The last time I went out to work on a regular basis, I would step out every lunchtime to a secondhand CD store, and I would seldom leave the place empty-handed. Usually I would be carrying four or sometimes more CDs to get me through the afternoon. I believe I bought something like 800 of the things during the two year contract. I did have a lot of catching up to do, though; I'd only acquired my very first CD player, if you can believe this, in December 1998, and for a full decade before that, I'd been in no position to buy music, so I'd amassed huge numbers of tapes. A fair proportion of the music I'd enjoyed through those years on cassette tape was the music I bought secondhand in Camberwell.  Now I'm working in a kind of grey area between Islington and Hackney, and there are several secondhand music places within striking distance, but in two weeks, and not for the want of searching, nor of inclination, I have bought only one secondhand CD. It is  I Am Shelby Lynne , by erm, Shelby Lynne. The MP3s are encoding as I type this. (One track from this album, the wonderful  Leavin' , has been a playlist fixture for more than a year, and I'm hoping that it isn't the best track on there by  too  wide a margin.) Why am blathering on like this? Oh yes. Why am I not buying shedloads of new music anymore?   I already have more music than any sensible person could want or need. Actually, about three or four times as much as any sensible person could want or need, and more than most of , you know, the other kind. I'm already spending too much time even deciding what to play next.   I can move ridiculous amounts of music around with me on MP3. I don't have a portable player yet, but every day I've been carrying three or four CDs from my backup box into work and copying a selection onto hard disk at work. That hard disk is now positively groaning with the stuff.    Perhaps I have more or less caught up with my tastes. There isn't really that much  new  music that interests me enough for me to make speculative purchases, which have always been an extravegance, and long may they remain so...

I didn't know this was going to happen; I had this vague idea that I was going to be taken to see a ballet sometime around xmas, but it sneaked up on me, and S. reminded me about midday, when I was still somewhere far short of recovery from the previous night's revels. So I showered and shaved and made myself presentable, and off we went to Wimbledon Theatre, and sat down to watch  urlLink A Christmas Carol  in ballet. I was fully expecting to doze off by the middle of the first act, if you want to know the sad truth of it, but I stayed awake and although I am by no means an afficianado, I quite enjoyed it. I didn't care much for tthe music, which was determinedly middle of the road, and slathered with predictable festive cheer - but the staging and lighting was effective, and some of the costumes - notably the ghosts - were outstanding.

      I've spent my day rebuilding my template for the site I'm working on, from the ground up, reincorporating a whole bunch of deprecated and obsolete tags, because for some reason the client insists that the site should accommodate those who insist on using the vile and useless Netscape 4.x. Of course it all makes work for the working codemonkey to do, but I just hope no-one comes breezing along this evening saying  sure, I swear by Netscape 4, wouldn't use anything else, what's the point in upgrading, because they're likely to get a smack around the head...

      I can't spend as long on this as I would like - I have to go and cook a risotto - but if I don't put something down now, I might forget, and we don't want that. I walk through a little patch of my own personal heaven every morning on my way to work. It is a short stretch of the Regent Canal, parallel to the City Road, between the Angel, where I burst out of the Fritz Lang nightmare of the tube system, and Wharf Road, where I climb the steps. There are a number of narrow boats moored along the canal at this point, and the banks are green and dark with overhanging trees, and the narrowboats - at least some of them - are a vision of a way of life that I pine for, though why exactly they have such a strong impression on me, I could not say.  This morning as I reached the canal bank, an unfamiliar boat had moored immediately before  the canal disappears into a tunnel. Evidently it is inhabited by a woodsman - there's a tree surgeon's sign on the side, and the aroma of woodsmoke from the stove below is delicious. On other boats along the bank, I notice bunches of drying flowers and bundles of withies, evidence of manual crafts that have all but disappeared from the environment. I get a thrill from these few minutes' walk every morning, even when the weather is filthy. It is one of the most magical spots that I know, in London or anywhere else.

       urlLink Magic Kingdoms  In the New Yorker, Adam Gopnik asks, what is a fairy tale, anyway?  Fairy tales, however many times they are transformed, depend in some part for their effect on an air of sincerity, of urgent seriousness. For the not merely wise but wised-up children of this new century, other tales and other, more skittish ways of telling seem to have usurped the old stories and styles. Which means that the fairy tale could be headed for the place where all our good used-up things go, America's Island of Misfit Toys, the college English department.

       urlLink     Since the early 1980s, artist Hubert Duprat has been utilizing insects to construct some of his "sculptures." By removing caddis fly larvae from their natural habitat and providing them with precious materials, he prompts them to manufacture cases that resemble jewelers' creations. Information theory, as explained by biologists such as Jacques Monod and Henri Atlan, helps us understand what seems to be the insect's aesthetic behavior. The activities of the caddis worm, as manipulated by Hubert Duprat, are prompted by the "noise"---beads, pearls and 18-karat gold pieces---introduced by the artist into the insect's environment. This article is based on a conversation between the artist and art critic Christian Besson.

      I've written a basic draft of a welcome page that may at some point greet those who roll  up here wearing Netscape 4.x. It goes like this:  Aah, Netscape 4.x. So. We meet again.  This site does its very best to be W3C standards-compliant. It may even "validate". If it doesn't, someone will be working on it.  This browser, however, is a very, very long way short of standards-compliance. This browser, my dear sir or madam, is a dying breed:- something in excess of 99% of the internet has now upgraded to standards-compliant browsers, and those people are, I promise you, having an absolutely wonderful time with their CSS layout, snappy pageloads, and so forth. These are sites that, were you to visit them in this old jalopy, might resemble something sad and broken. But those sites are not sad & broken! Your browser, dearest of visitors, is what is sad and broken. What is your problem? Consult your dealer, you know? So, the word is, go immediately to a download site such as (whatever) and get yourself a proper browser. Mozilla 1.2.1 is very good, and it's workings will be more familiar to Netscape users than they might be otherwise.

      Well, there's no escaping the fact that there's been nothing on here since thursday, so I must be leading an eventful life. The damaged fingernail came off on friday, and I was going to scan the result, which is by far the most photogenic state its been in since the accident - but then I remember I haven't used the scanner since before the migration, and then I remember the dishes. Or the kettle. Anyway, it isn't done yet, and neither for that matter are the dishes. Of the weekend, I remember football. I remember seeing a mouse on the railway line, and then a fox trotting (as they are wont to do) behind the fence, running the length of the platform opposite. I remember waking up more often in chairs than in full repose.  And lots of preening of MP3 id tags, the better to play around with them in iTunes. iTunes is growing on me, I must admit. Soon as I've got the basics out of the way, I'll write me some of them Smart Playlists. Aherm. Yessir. So what with all that, and coding eight hours a day for money, and two hours (or more) per day commuting... you probably know how the sums go. I just don't have the hours I used to devote to this. I'm definitely looking at that commute. That's a lot of reading and writing time...

      Second talk on matters esoteric in the space of a week. I must be needing to restore balance to a life given over to coding for a living. Last night Steve Wilson addressed a packed upper room at the Princess Louise in New Oxford Street on the subject of "Living Gnosticism". This was a meeting of a group called The Secret Chiefs, about which you can read  urlLink here  (although there isn't a whole lot there - the list of previous talks makes interesting reading, though...).  SW's talk was complex and bewildering in parts, but contained interesting revelations: there is apparently an authentic and continuous gnostic sect which traces back to pre-christian times, originating (?) in what is now northern Iraq - and a good number of them are living in exile just down the road from me, in Catford! They are called the Mandaeans, and they are the people referred to in the Koran as the Sabians. They have an  urlLink official site  (sluggish to load, most of it in Arabic, but it's there)  - or you might keep an eye out on  urlLink Google ...

       urlLink   Attended another meeting of the South East London Folklore Society last night - Michael Staley gave forth on the subject of initiation, with particular reference to an  urlLink Austin Osman Spare  drawing called  The Background of Prescience . I've been unable to find this picture on the interweb, but there are some typical examples of Spare's work  urlLink here . He wasn't a great artist, but he was a hell of a lot better than Crowley, who for all his other talents was a  dreadful  painter (and not in a good way). I must say I was a little surprised to hear that he didn't think formal initiation was very important. It's understandable that someone may find the experience something of a let-down if initiation (in the sense of revelation of hidden knowledge) doesn't provide answers the initiate might hope for - but I have to suggest that there is a social and psychological significance in exoteric initiation, the loss of which in secular society, it could be argued, makes lifelong infants of us all. Which is all very fine for proponents and beneficiaries of heirarchical, paternalistic (and for that matter, consumerist) societies - but of course there are initiations for the elites, the Freemasons and the likes of the  urlLink Skull & Bones  - now, what about the rest of us? Shouldn't we consider reclaiming our rituals of validation and recognition as grownups? Mmmm?

      Such has been my state of distraction that a blogworthy thought that occured to me a full ten days ago hasn't yet made it into the blog. It was only because it cropped up in conversation in the pub last night that I'm recalling it now: has anyone noticed how tech shops are changing their look? It struck me, as I say, about ten days ago when I ventured into Tottenham Court Road to buy a hard disk. As the kit becomes smaller, computer shops are starting to resemble jewellers' stores, as the merchandise gets smaller, ever more  bijou : only the secondhand stores have the ranks of beige boxes that used to fill the storefronts of TCR... I wonder if the stores themselves will eventually shrink around the wares they sell, or if the space will be more taken up with the glossy lifestyle projections that come with the selling of consumer electronics...

      There had to be an easier way, but I made it back (again).  The problem seems to have been a suspicious IP address that somehow crept into the network settings which wouldn't be removed, and some alteration to the startup routine that wanted to wait for network initialisation before letting me in. After a minute or so, it would give up waiting and start the machine up anyway. If this had been 9.2, I'd have just thrown away the network prefs and taken it from there, but at this stage it is far from obvious to me which file I could safely and usefully throw away, so I ended up doing a fresh install of OSX (with upgrades) and drivers for the DSL modem (with upgrades) and the driver for the USB hub that connects the DSL modem, re-entered all the settings and now (should that be  for now ?) it's all working again. Maybe I'll have time for some  interesting  bloggage a bit later on, but I didn't have breakfast yet...

Job done, I restarted back in OSX - and the blasted thing is denying all knowledge of ever having heard of the boradband setup - the diagnostics software is still there (it  tells  me that it is diagnostics software, but it doesn't tell me much else, like a few health professionals I know) but the connection program insists that the communications device does not exist, and I should verify my settings and try again. And here I am back in 9.2, connected through a communications device which most definitely exists, and wondering what to try next.  Does this ring bells for any OSX / broadband users out there?

      There was a time when New Year's Day was the most documented day of the year - diaries abandoned after a single entry. The emptiness of the day itself, the year not yet really begun, the festivities over (at last) and what better way to fill out the day than inscribing one's intentions, formalised as grandly capitalized Resolutions. Then the year got started, everything went back to normal, the diaries, and most of the intentions probably, forgotten. Now our diaries are everywhere, normal is nowhere, and we have these machines to do our remembering for us...  urlLink   Once upon a time, I climbed a mountain at New Year. 1984? 1985? One or the other.  The mountain was Ben Rinnes (840m, doesn't sound as impressive as 2,759ft, does it?), the northernmost of the Bens, southwest of Dufftown, and no more than about 4km from Glen Fiddich.  There were white hares up there, peering at us from rocky look-outs at a safe distance, and then haring off over the snow - as they are, of course, completely entitled to do - before we got anywhere near them... We climbed the northern face, in shade, so as we reached the higher ground, windblown ice and snow, cloud peeling off the mountaintop and trailing away behind us, the watery midwinter sun down into our faces through the ice mist. One of the most unworldlly environments I've ever experienced... you can find Ben Rinnes by clicking on the (unhelpfully reduced) map there, finding Dufftown with the search facility, and heading SW. The  urlLink Ordnance Survey  site appears to offer no way to bookmark locations, nor to determine a grid reference for a location, once found.

       Today I am mostly enjoying  urlLink Milestone at the Garden  subtitled  Irish Fiddle Masters from the 78rpm Era  (meaning, 1923-1959). I've had this CD for about three years, but it fell among low company (less interesting compilations) and I'd forgotten, until yesterday, that I even owned a copy. The album included what is presently the oldest dated recording in my MP3 collection,  Over The Lakes , played by Fireman Barney Conlon, in 1923, older by  a couple of years than the oldest tracks on the Harry Smith Anthologies.  Sadly, this was Fireman Barney's only recording - what a terrible waste of a great name! - and the only references I've found to the guy through Google bring me straight back to this particular track on this CD. And there are no pictures, so here's one from the booklet of the Hanafin Brothers, whose contribution is  Miss Macleod's  (1926) will be recognisable to Holy Modal Rounders fans (and others) as  Hop High Ladies .

       "If we accept the notion that using power against the powerless is wrong, a clear enough set of corollaries begins to emerge. We become able to distinguish, as populations (though not always their rulers) have usually been able to do, between outlaws and evil-doers, between outlawry and sin. Not much analysis is needed, because it is something we can sense in all its dead-serious immediacy. 'But all they are are bandits', the rulers whine indignantly, 'motivated only by greed'. Sure. Except that, having long known the difference between theft and restoration, we understand the terms of the deal whereby outlaws, as agents of the poor, being more skilled and knowledgable in the arts of karmic readjustment, may charge no worse than an agent's fee, small enough to be acceptable to their clients, ample enough to conver the risks they have to take, and we always end up loving these folks, we cheer for John Dillinger, Rob Roy, Jesse James, at a level of passion usually reserved for sports affiliation."

And later this afternoon, in the market at Crystal Palace, I turned up another Jamaican record on the Copasetic label. If I was stuck for things to collect, which I certainly am not, I might start a collection of words of unknown origin. I can't help but feel it's a fine quality in a word, that no-one can say where it comes from, or from what it is derived... but as Homer Simpson would have it, the important thing is that  I diidn't dream it ...

      There's a rather strange antique shop just down the road from me - strange, because it's isolated and in London at least, antique shops tend to flock together in chichi areas that can stand the pain. Also the proprietors are anti-vivisection campaigners, not that there's anything wrong with that, but there's something slightly unhinged about the rather home-made, off-the-top-of-their-heads way they go about it: slightly deranged looking petitions pinned up in the window along side the china and upholstery.  That isn't what this is about, although in a way, it makes what I just saw in their window even more bizarre. It's a life size bronze of a pit-bull terrier (or similar fighting dog, I'm not really up on the nastier breeds of canine) in full, snarling lunge. Four hundred and fifty quid to you, squire. And you know what? Round here, it will probably sell within the week. Not to connoisseurs of 19th century bronzes, either... I don't imagine it will still be there when I buy my camera, around the end of the month, but if it is, I'll post a picture...

      Aw'right then. Looks as if I won't be going out to work again until next monday, so along with a whole shivering heap of domestic chores to be undertaken, I'll be able to spend a little more time with my dialogue box. Yippee! As I mentioned, I've been spending a lot of time preening the tags on my MP3s, the better to employ the programmable playlists. These are coming along nicely, although it feels a little like I imagine it feels to be painting the Forth Bridge. Anyway, I've started implementing a custom genre system, the categories of which refer to moods rather than musical genres, because I may well require a dose of confrontational music (genre contains 'represent'), but when would I ever filter on 'rock', because I felt like listening to generic 'rock' music (however you care to draw the boundaries of that concept)? There are a few musical genres I might preserve - I may well want to filter a 'jazz' or 'dub' subset out of the 'shinyhappy' or 'blue' genres, for example... now that the basics are out of the way (duplicates removed, variations of spelling artist's names resolved, and the dates of release (at least for whole albums), trickier bits like genre handling can proceed more or less organically.

Yesterday I picked up a copy of Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music - at last! - and I even played most of it, though I didn't have time for it all.

       This is turning into a portent, that's what it's doing. For three days or so, I've left an MP3 file on my desktop, which is where it first appeared overnight. At first I thought it had come in as an attachment, but on closer examination it turned out to be a copy of a file I already had in my library. I hadn't played it recently, but somehow a copy of it had popped up on the desktop. It's the tenth track from Bob Calvert's   urlLink Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters  . Now I've eventually got around to playing the track again, and the album and since  urlLink the story is pretty interesting , I did a little googling, as one does, and came across  urlLink this page  the first item on the menu of which promises "Brief history with details of speed records" but the link takes us  urlLink  here , and we find ourselves righteously spooked out.

         urlLink   Thanks to a tip-off from  urlLink plasticbag.org , I am now playing about with a very cute new software gizmo, name of  urlLink Clutter . It's a little OS X application that looks up the tune playing in your iTunes, fetches the appropriate album cover from the prodigous Amazon database, and displays it in the primary Clutter window. Then, the cute part. It is possible to drag any number of these album cover images onto the desktop, where they can sit, in whatever arrangement you may care for, and you can rummage around in them, and when you find something you fancy hearing, you double click it, and off it goes.       There's more. The album covers, which behave somewhat like windows, and somewhat like icons, are zoomable from ridiculously tiny to screen-fillingly huge. Keystrokes will whisk to to the relevant page on Amazon, or to Google search results.       There are a couple of minor grumbles, which aren't really serious enough to amount to bugs - the search is rather literal, and I was dismayed to find that the first three or four tracks I tried gave no results when Amazon's database disagreed in rather inconsequential ways with my ID tags, and when I double click an album on my desktop, it takes a small eternity to find the tracks in my collection and get going. But then, my collection is unfeasibly large.       This thing has been out in the world about two weeks, so I expect there will be some refinements - mutating into a plug-in for iTunes, perhaps? - but it's a brilliiantly simple idea, it deserves to be everywhere, and to make Sprote a gazillionaire. Which, since Clutter is freeware, is unlikely to happen...       Now, if some kind soul would figure a way of piping this through to blogger or MT, and we can have a bunch of album covers floating up and floating down the page, we've got something that'll show a clean pair of heels to Blogamp, n'est ce pas?

      A few catch ups: the coots are nesting now. I'd been off work for four days before yesterday (long birthday weekend, thank you for asking) and when I took my first nicotine break of the morning, there she was, esconced, every inch the empress, and bad-tempered with it, being, when all is said and done, still a coot. Her other half is still chugging up and down the canal basin, collecting twigs, and muttering.  I still haven't bought the camera. Top candidate is the Canon Powershot, but I'm still dithering. When I do, I can foresee this mutating into more of a photo blog, since I just don't have the time anymore to rummage around on the net for things to write about, and I don't really do journal blogs. Not really.  Despite evidence from the last couple of months' archives which may suggest that I do.

       urlLink   Yesterday's mystery bird has been identified by a workmate. The blighter's a Muscovy Duck, and the photo on the left there is the only one of the many I've found that looks anything like the bird I saw yesterday (and again today). Most Muscovy ducks are darker of plumage.  Little known facts about the Muscovy duck:    They don't swim very much, because unlike most ducks, their waterproofing oil glands are not well developed.   You're more likely to come back with a recipe than natural history. jThe American Heritage Dictionary describes the bird's flesh as 'succulent', which is a bit fruity for a dictionary, if you ask me.  urlLink Muscovy duck in burgundy and cranberry sauce  sounds rather nice.   The workmate who identified him added that he was obliged to boot the creature into the canal this morning, when he was menaced and hissed at on the canal path. This duck is possessed of a Bad Attitude. I forgot to mention yesterday that he was mostly engaged in psyching out the geese.   Muscovies are natives of South America, the they are the only domesticated ducks unrelated to the mallard. Which perhaps explains why I didn't think the beak was duck-like.      urlLink Here  is a picture of a Musocovy Duck in profile, in silhouette, and up a tree, which shows just how little like ducks these fellows can look.  And  urlLink here , ladies and gentlemen, is a PDF of an article which claims that "The Internet Is A Muscovy Duck". A proposition which requires further rumination, I think...

       Twitchers of the blogosphere, help me out here. There was a mystery visitor to the canal basin today. A large bird - at least as big in the body as the Canada geese that hang around there, but with shorter legs and shorter neck. Sharply defined but irregular pathes of black and white feathers on the body, black to grey wings, briight red about the eyes, and a dark crest. I didn't see him swimming, but if he wasn't some kind of water bird, you'd have to have him down as some kind of water bird wannabe, considering the location. Cack-handed drawing from memory enclosed. I wasn't close enough to see the beak properly, but it didn't seem at all duck or goose-like. I already looked in some of the more obvious places to check, like the  urlLink  Bird Family List , but other than establishing that it definitely wasn't a Crested Grebe, I'm none the wiser....

      What will they think of next?   Severely disabled people who cannot operate a motorised wheelchair may one day get their independence, thanks to a system that lets them steer a wheelchair using only their thoughts.   Unlike previous thought-communication devices, the system does not use surgical implants. Instead a skullcap peppered with electrodes monitors the electrical activity of its wearer's brain. Early trials using a steerable robot indicate that with just two days training it is as easy to control the robot with the human mind as it is manually.   At the moment the system controls a simple wheeled robot. The user dons the electrode-lined skullcap, which monitors electrical activity on the surface of the head. A web of wires sends the information to a computer. Millán's software then analyses the brain's activity and, using a wireless link, passes on any commands it spots to the robot.   At the moment the user can choose between three different commands: for example, "turn left", "turn right" and "move forward"....

My hosting company replaced the server with a two week old backup yesterday, which wrecked the template once I republished the site - the backup didn't have the stylesheets and scripts that the new template uses.

The providers have assured me that all will be well if I let them know which folders to copy over to the server when they swap back, but I am skeptical ( - you noticed?).

      Okay, the template appears to be installed, after all. Something a bit odd happened last night as I was, or thought I was, uploading the new template to the server. Everything fine and doodly at this end. Up go the scripts, stylesheets, images. Into Blogger, the template goes in, the changes are saved, and publish. Publish successful. We have a look, and we tweak a couple of tweaks, republish the offending scripts and there you go. Except that some of the images aren't loading. I check the code. I am considering publishing a test image, I'm putting up the latest tweak, and I publish. Publish error. We have another look, and when the page finally loads, it is as if none of this work has been done. Even the posts I've made are not showing any longer. The server then shut up shop knocking back connections through Blogger, and directly by FTP. This morning, however, all is well. There was no sign of the files I'd uploaded last night, so I put them up again, and here we are. I assume that I was switched onto a backup server in the middle of my upload, which was a bit trippy.  So, comments on the new template. Regarding functionality, rather than aesthetics. Are the dropdown items working as they ought? They ought to be closed when the page loads, and expand when clicked, contract when clicked again. Are any of the text blocks overlapping each other? This is bad, and if it is happening, you're hardly likely to have read this far into the post, so hey, we'll probably never know. You would think that I, as a professional DHTML coder, would check my template on a PC browser or two before unleashing it on the world, wouldn't you? Oh no. Oh no no no....

      Today I've had more new toys landed in my lap than I've had on any given Xmas in at least the last ten years. By happy coincidence, orders for a  urlLink new printer , memory card for the camera, the  urlLink O'Reilly DHTML Definitive Reference  all arrived on the day that I came home with a new  urlLink MiniDisc recorder , and six, mostly science fiction books picked up from the strange anti-vivisection antique shop I mentioned a few months ago.   I do realise that I haven't actually posted any pictures to speak of, yet. But it'll be coming! I've just about sorted out the slideshow stuff - PC users of sufficiently evolved calibre will even see the little beggars  fade into each other  (which I presently can't on the Mac - which is very odd, because I could have sworn I saw a filter fader working, at some point, in either IE or Mozilla, and now neither of the current versions want to do it at all. Maybe I dreamed it.)  Also, of course, I can now pick from about 500 recent pictures, which is a large enough sample that even a trembly-handed buffoon such as Yr Humble Svt. can make a reasonable showing. Someone long ago  quoted to me from the sayings of some exemplary photographic master who may or may not have been Cartier-Bresson, that  anyone  who takes thousands of pictures over a long period of time is just bound to get a few good ones along the way. After that, its just a matter of  noticing them ...

       You see, George, it's not the lying and the doctoring of intelligence that has me all upset. It's that you've had control of Iraq for over two months now – and you couldn't even find the time to plant just a few nukes or vats of nerve gas and at least make it look like you weren't lying to us.   You see, by not faking some evidence of weapons of mass destruction, it shows that you thought no one would mind if it turned out you made everything up. A different kind of president, who believes that the American public would be outraged if they ever found out the truth, would go to great lengths to cover up his subterfuge.

      Yes, nexistepas.com, and consequently this blog, is back on its wobbly pins again. I won't bore you with all the lurid details, but essentially my previous hosting company couldn't be bothered to sort out the renewal of the domain, as they had promised to do back in July when I first raised the point with them. It turns out that when I asked them if they had the domain renewal scheduled, and they said yes, they hadn't even understood the question. Leave it to us, they said, and you see what happened. Domain falls off the map of the world... and then they took five whole days *after* I'd given up on them, renewed the domain myself and taken it elsewhere, before they even looked at it and noticed, hey, he's taken his business to another company... Sigh... So anyway, the blog is back up, but I"m pretty sure that most of the images are broken in the archives - I haven't even gone there yet - so that will need some looking at... soon, soon...

      Ominous rumblings, in the most literal sense, from Yellowstone...  "The impact of a Yellowstone eruption is terrifying to comprehend." says Professor McGuire. "Magma would be flung 50 kilometres into the atmosphere. Within a thousand kilometres virtually all life would be killed by falling ash, lava flows and the sheer explosive force of the eruption. One thousand cubic kilometres of lava would pour out of the volcano, enough to coat the whole of the USA with a layer 5 inches thick. The explosion would be the loudest noise heard by man for 75,000 years."

      As the second day of trawling through the blogrolls approaches its end, I've reached the bottom of the second 'roll ("furthermore..."). I've visited sites I haven't looked at in almost a year, some of which turn out no longer to exist, but happily there haven't been too many of those. Nearly everyone's redesigned to some extent, though. In the course of my travels, I've added but one address to the 'rolls:  urlLink also not found in nature , which inclines towards hard news, and excited a permanent link for the commendable observation - on Blair's determination to infest the UK with GM crops regardless of the dangers - that "the only surprise here is that there are still officials in Whitehall who believe Blair works for the British government ...".

      This afternoon I have noticed at least two things. First thing:  urlLink William Gibson has ceased blogging , over a month ago, persuaded that trying to write a novel while blogging would be like trying to boil a kettle whose lid was left off (I'd be interested to know what  urlLink Charlie Stross  would say about this). So he's gone back to his day job.   The second thing I noticed (stumbled over it while reading the last month's archive of Gibson's blog) is that it is possible to download the  urlLink Babelizer  as a stand-somewhat-alone OS X app. So I did, and I gave it my previous post, ran it through all the available languages, thus:   The transport and the eye of the prices of the exchange, if with this same something Seins is qualified side, are consideravelmente near, but of Yoo, where this fact a private individual for measurement, which however the moment decides thus that it is him that you withdrew the adze ' and in the love of the place of the punnery, it, vorbehaltlichen an additional tiny room by additional additional of the methodologische of the additional material of water it, this 1, this for the cause of this of insufficient, is, for which they it folded those is, aechzt, it comes from the white woman of the woman who  increases you with him if, for the respect?

I have begged him to come out and meet me; I have been longing for a conversation with him, but he won't come out, and now here he is asking me to meet him at the palace! I was there with a million people on February 15, and the last time I was there was just a couple of weeks ago. My cousin, Michael Powell, was arrested and taken to Thornhill Road police station in Birmingham where he died. Now, I know how he died. The whole of Birmingham knows how he died, but in order to get this article published and to be politically (or journalistically) correct, I have to say that he died in suspicious circumstances. The police will not give us any answers. We have not seen or heard anything of all the reports and investigations we were told were going to take place. Now, all that my family can do is join with all the other families who have lost members while in custody because no one in power is listening to us. Come on Mr Blair, I'll meet you anytime.

      This is kind of interesting, thunk I to myself, when I found the  urlLink ITMS Link Maker  - whatcha do is, you enter song titles, album titles and/or recording artistes and the page returns an HTML link to the object of your search, so that folks can follow you into the iTunes music store and hear a sample what you're blethering on about. And buy it from the Music Store, if they're daft. Otherwise, they can whizz off somewhere else and pick up the actual CD. What it doesn't do is link to the more interesting, feature aspect of the store, so I am unable to link, for example, to Michael Stipe's celebrity playlist, which I might vaguely have wanted to do. 99 cents doesn't sound like a lot to pay for a tune, if you say it quickly. Then you see that you can buy, say, all of the tracks from Stipe's playlist, and that will set you back more than $30 - which is a hell of a price, really. Should be able to get some kind of quantity discount, at the very least...

It must be pliant enough to ratify the CPA's illegal laws, which will then be celebrated as the happy marriage of free markets and free people. Once that happens, it will be too late: the contracts will be locked in, the deals done and the occupation of Iraq permanent."

      It isn't every day I discover a new compression format. Rather bemused, when downloading some bits of Pearl Jam's appearance at the Bridge School concert, to discover the finished article was a folder (styled .shnf) containing a number of .shn files, which as I say, are a new one on me. A little research later, it turns out that .shn denoted a Shortened file. Shorten is briefly described  urlLink here  - it emerges from a Cambridge outfit called  urlLink SoftSound , and there is a lengthier and more helpful description, at least for Mac users,  urlLink here . Shortening reduces WAV file size by about 50%, but is claimed to be lossless, and so it is gaining favour amongst audiophile swappers. So I downloaded a copy of Shorten for Mac (from  urlLink here ), and showed it the scary .shn files, and it spat out a string of WAVs, which are playing just beautifully in iTunes as I type. Of course I will now be converting them to MP3, and thus irretrievably blowing whatever audiophile cred I may have been building up here, but there you are...

       urlLink  The Balvenie  12-year-old Double Wood in the house. Rich, dark and chocolatey.  Not for the first time, I wish I could scan and upload an aroma. The site is rather nice, if a little fussy, although I've noticed that although the text on the site, and for that matter on the helpful leaflet included in the bottle's packaging, is really rather small, it didn't have me groping for my reading specs.  Not too impressed by their insistence on collecting an email address before they'll let you see anything but marketing fluff, though...

      One of the sites I was working on this time last year, the BFI's  urlLink screenonline  has gone live, at last. Happily, it still looks pretty much the way I coded it, so there's a new item for my CV page, whenever I get around to putting that back up. The first crop of features includes a piece on  urlLink Oliver Postgate's Smallfilms , known to long term readers as one of enthusiasm's household gods. It seems that access to audio and video clips on this site, however, is for registered users only, and registration is limited to schools, colleges and libraries. Bummer.  The sister site, luxonline, which I coded in parallel with this one, has yet to launch. What can they be doing with it? The front end was finished back in February...

      Also from Eliot, this  urlLink article    tells of Carmelite nuns agreeing to have their brains scanned while they attempt to recall the feeling on  unio mystica  in search of the neurophysiological seat of religious experience. A rather too-cute neologism has been coined for the line of enquiry this project represents:  neurotheology  - but the piece is interessting enough to overlook that.

      I'm (mostly) back. There was this glass of port, you see, that Someone had placed between me and the keyboard, while T was engrossed in something down to my right somewhere, and I turned back to the keyboard, and over went the drink. In seventeen years of messiing about with computers, this is the first time I've sloshed the keyboard, full on, with a glass of liquid. Since it was port, it was no good just waiting for it to dry and hoping for the best (sticky, sticky, for all eternity), so I unplugged it, ran it under the tap pretty thoroughly, and dried it off. Yesterday i managed to coax just enough of a response from the keyboard to log into the machine, but after that, nothing sensible could be done. What you see below is a scan of a sticky note, which was about all I could do using only the mouse to operate the machine. Then the keyboard went back into the airing cupboard for another 24 hours, and  went off to explore Life without The Screen. Today, all but the south-western corner of the keyboard seems to be fully recovered - neither of the Command keys is working, nothing happens when I hit the z or the x which I'm selecting from the character palette, in case you were wondering (good thing Samuel Morse didn't put the e down there, eh?). When I  finish up here tonight, The keyboard's going back in the airing cupboard again. Hopefully I'll have my remaning keys restored to me by tomorrow, or I'll have to go buy a new one after all. Can't go for long without the command key (equivalent of the PC's ctrl key - imagine living without that sucker, if you will).

      Some confusion and controversy at  urlLink nettime  over a piece by Wayne Madsen at Counterpunch,  urlLink Wag the Turkey  which claims that the WMPC's hit-and-run Thanksgiving Dinner in Baghdad took place at 6am local time. This contradicts  urlLink other sources , which have Air Force One landing "after sunset", around 5.30pm. At the time of this posting, no correction has appeared on the CP site. Madsen gives no source for his information, but if he's sticking to his story, he ought to. As Kurt Ralske points out in the  urlLink nettime thread :  This raises an interesting question: how does one decide what the threshold of credibility is for a non-mainstream source of information? -- By the quality of the writing? By the popularity of the source? By the degree of intersection with one's own politics? By the quality of the web design?

      7th March 1937 - 22nd February 2004  My mum passed away early on Sunday morning, after suffering a heart attack, out of the blue, on Friday morning. The ambulance team got her into resuscitation within 30mins of the attack, and at first there was little serious concern. It was thought that she'd be in hospital for a week or so, then home for rest. By Saturday morning, the hospital were making radically different prognosis, and my three brothers and I converged on Liverpool. Happily, we all made it in time to see her, and more to the point, for her to see us. She slipped away peacefully at around dawn on Sunday.   I am still groping for words, but I know the words will eventually come.

      Okay, so you have a Torrent on the go, and you have a squint at it to see how it's coming along, and you find that there's so many KBs coming down, and so many KBs going up - but then you notice that your Torrent session is connected to... one, count 'em, peers. Wha? If this peer has more of the file than I do, then juice should be coming down to me, otherwise it should be going up from me to them. Oo-or have I misunderstood something? Wouldn't be the first time, of course...

The turnout was gobsmacking: there must have been nearly two hundred people, many I had not seen in at least twenty five years.  I think I'll be writing more about this, but perhaps not here. In any case, onward and upward.

      I came, I chattered (a bit), I left. While it was great to see those bloggers I already knew, and a couple or three new ones, I really didn't care for the venue. No windows, for one thing. A crowded, noisy basement with a cubby hole through which they sold wildly overpriced drinks (£4.50 for a half pint bottle of Grolsch - excuse me?). Then again, I got to meet Euen Semple, and confirm a strange occurrence. A week or two ago, I'd been walking through town somewhere - wish I could remember where exactly this was - and a tall, grey-haired chap strode past. 'That,' I thought to myself, 'is Euen Semple'. I don't know how I knew this, as far as I remember I'd only ever seen a thumbnail-sized headshot picture of him, but I was quite convinced of it. Anyway, there he was, large as life, and definitely the person I passed in the street the other day. Spooky, eh?

      was that I'd been unable to post for about a week, some configuration tweakage did the business, and here we are again. During the course of my fiddling in the guts of Blogger, I changed over to a regulation issue template, to see if that made a difference to the publishing problem. It didn't, but I'd forgotten to switch it back. In any case, this template contains all the built-in comments code and the other new blogger stuff that needed to be incorporated anyway, so it's all going into the new site design, and that'll be finished, oooh, any time now.

      this is a message from the void. I've been deprived of net access at home since last tuesday - thanks a bunch, BT customer services - and I'm likely to remain so until somewhere in the region of next weekend. Maybe by then I will feel a bit more like writing than I have done lately. There's a new template pretty much done, so when I do get back online, this page will be a good deal more presentable than it is at the moment. You never know, maybe I can find the time to mark up some of the other pages that used to live here, and put them back up, too. It's not as if the delights of the network will be distracting me at all for the next few days...
