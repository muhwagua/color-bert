      Ok, Ok, so I caved into having one of these things, Im so independant................., or not.  Whats that you ask? My story? My story is a simple one, one that begins with a bottle of wine, a honeymoon, and no rubber, yes thats right, no rubber.  Im 15, Freshman in highschool, enjoys guitar, soccer, and golf, only good at one of the three (between you and me, im not even that good at it). I'm a smart ass, or so ive been told by anyone thats been around me.  Thats how i was brought up though, i had to fend for myself, if there was a joke available, i take it, it may not be a good one, but if it gets a couple chuckles, im happy.  I give everyone one chance with me, they blow that, they can blow me, i dont see the point in wasteing my time on someone that doesnt deserve it.  I like a lot of classic rock music, some rap is ok, and country can die and i would frollick around the streets naked with joy, letting my bare ass freeze off all with a smile on my face.  Im a pretty good kid. stay out of trouble mostly, just mouth off a lot.  I get away with more stuff than people think.  Like my German teacher, Mrs. Larson, yeah i can swear and do anything in that class and not have anything said to me, but when brandon does, he becomes the Whipping Boy.  He's a great guy though, im proud to stand by him and laugh as he gets in trouble, for things i do everyday. I think thats enough for one day.  Enjoy my friends,  -Jonathan   (im single, incase you were wondering, and im getting very irritated with it, so if your interested, let me know, {that was really corny})   Current Music- any song thats by Dispatch (any song isnt the actual song its me saying that im listening to everyone of dispatches songs i have, wow i went way to far into detail for that one)

      Today i felt kind of down, like i dont know what to do now, i dont have any goals really, no desire to set them.  I need a vacation, which i will get in july, and june. June = South Carolina to visit my cousins with my grandma, hardly a vacation.  July= either Florida or Gatlinburg with Will, so thats more of a vacation than the other, hopefully lots of fun instore this summer.  I need a break from school, ive lost the desire to go on.  I dont see the point anymore.  I kind of wish that i could go back to being a kid where i didnt have to worry, everything was meaningless, the whole universe revolved around the grass and the bugs it held. but now the universe revolves around school and the demons that it holds.  I wish that i could just go and lay in the grass and stare at the sky for hours on end, or just run till i couldnt run anymore, or just roll down a hill, or just sit around and play with legos.  Now instead of doing the things i once loved, im forced to do things that i cant stand such as homework or chores. My parents come up for me something for me to do always, i cant just have a minute to myself anymore.  I always have to be doing busy work i cant just appreciate the simple things in life such as playing with rocks of building houses out of cards or listening to music and watching tv at the same time because i didnt want to miss anything.  I wish i could go back to simpler times. if only, if only.  Thats all for today.  Music:  Run Away- Flock of Seagulls

      Today Sucked, In german we had to do a little show thingy and mrs larson called us gay because it was 4 guys going to cancun and jokingly i called lacey a whore for wanting to go with 4 guys to cancun, Mrs. Larson, didnt take it as a joke.  I got called down to the office 6th period and Mr. Clark Thankfully only let me go with a warning, because it was a joke and lacey didnt care. He talked to me about respecting women and how i should think before i say the things that i say.  He ended his talking with saying  Plus he joked about the name calling in that class.  I had to do some major butt kissing to get out of that one.  I never groveled so much.  I feel bad though because brandon got one before for doing the same thing, i kind of want some punishment because what i did was wrong and i dont deserve to get off free.  Although it was nice to not have to explain to my parents.  So today i pissed my pants with fear.  Pretty cool eh'? sorry Brandon

      Today was boring, which was good because i am extreamly lazy, i only mowed about 20 feet today, my dad did the rest.  I watched The Fith Element wich was a very entertaining, although its a very stupid movie.  Oliver beene was on tonight and i watched that too.  Malcom was good.  I need a life.  I didnt do the homework that i had, dont see a reason anymore.  Its not very much of a chalenge.  I hate school. it needs a decent fight.  We get our yearbooks monday, so central people, better right something good.  Itll give me something good to read when im 40 and living in my parents basement.   I need a girlfriend.  I need a life, i need some prozac. im always so depressed.  It reminds me of a song, ahh yes a song, the song goes something like, Tommorow, Tommorow, I'll love ya tommorow............................some more singing.................who am i kidding, i dont know the words.  Im going to go watch tv and try to satisfy my A.D.D. later.           I need help, i think i spend to much time thinking up excuses for my problems with diseases.   Its fun to bug Mrs. Carter with though.  Later.   Song:  The candyman Can, Willy Wonka soundtrack

      I don't know what to do, i really like this girl but  i dont think she likes me, and i also can never talk to her because there is this guy always following her around and they dont like eachother but its always really awkward when i talk to her in front of him.  I dont know what to do, i wish i was Leon Phelps then i wouldnt have to worry about girls they would all flock to me, because i would be the ladies man, and i would have a fro and a entire house-boat full of 70's style fabric, clothes, and other entising jewls of desire. But until then im going to have to stay myself and keep trying to woo this woman into liking me.  Hopefully my charm will prevail, or lack there of.  Ok thats enough bitching for a while. later everyone. If you know who you are, im me and tell me what you think.

      Went to farm, got my ass kicked, surprisingly not by patzer this time, actually it was by a rock side i fell down it and on sunday i got up and could hardly walk, my knees and head and shoulder hurt so bad, i had fun though. After the farm i went to sams for the night and hung out with katie and played wade in some counter strike, he was actually better than i thought he would be.  But im kinda depressed that me and that girl didnt work out, because  i really wish that it would have and im going to try to get it to work this summer, i really like her, and it sucks because i cant do anything about it.  I cant make her like me, so im just going to have to wait it out and see what her next move is. but if shes reading this, and you know who you are, now you know how i feel.  im out........................... later kids

      Ello' everyone, North Carolina was cool, i got hardly any sleep and i didnt drop the baby, so thats a milestone for me.   but other than that,  it went well.  oh and im going to get my braces off on the 9th.  I really realized the fact that i am so fortunate to have such great people surrounding me.  I think thats the best thing for anyone is the people they surround themselves with.  And thats why people do stupid stuff that hurts people because they dont have anyone positive around them to tell the difference. i just wish people could tell the difference from good and bad.  i may say some hurtfull things sometimes but really honest to god i dont mean them i dont think before i say stuff and it comes out wrong and its wrong of me to do that. and im sorry for what i say and do sometimes i just wish i could take somethings back and not take so much for granite.  thats just what i needed to get off my chest.  i think im over the girl, we'll see i have someone else in mind.  so i guess thats all for today.  song o' the day-  Pete Yorn- Strange Condition

      Well its been quite a while since I've written in this puppy, but since my add and lack of participation in anything frees up a lot of my time I thought id restart this bad boy back up.  Lets recap......Since my last post which was July 5th some things have happened, I am now  a sophomore at central and my hair is longer and I'm about 2 inches taller.....And were up to speed. Good great grand wonderful.  My day to day is pretty much the same as it was, school, home, sleep.  Basic needs of today's society education shelter and sleep.  I'm starting to get more into criminal psychology which is something I could see myself doing so I'm happy I found something to do with my life finally. My sister, nikki is at IU and will be graduating in december and then only to return for another round of grad school ( she wants to be an Art Lawyer, dont ask because i dont know), and my other sister, Lisa is in Nashville with a job and a life outside of the four walls that i call my home.  Parents are the same...now back to me.  IN Gym class were playing Soccer and its quite a lot of fun, although it would be more fun if we had a team that actually was organized and didnt just either stand there or rush to the ball in a big clump.  Im out for now. LATER  -Jonathan

      Having no citizen ship sucks, the whole no exempting finals situation really pisses me off.  So we get out of school tuesday where i will be a junior.  Im not really sure if im ready to be a junior, i still have a lot of growing up to do.  Hopefully this summer, with the responsibility that im getting ill also receive some maturity.  Courtney is planning something for tuesday and im nervous because i hate secrets and i dont know what to expect and im already freaking out.  But im gonna go to bed soon so im gonna let you go all you visitors out there.  oh yeah people who say gay shit on tag boards need to be put in front of a firing squad.  but thats just one of many people opinions...........many people who agree with me.

      Welcome back ya'll ive got the motivation all the sudden to start this bad boy right back up again, we'll see how long it lasts.  So its almost summer and i feel like it isnt comming soon enough.  Also Ive started driving and its more fun than i ever imagined.  last friday i went out with a special little lady friend of mine, COURTNEY  and we saw Troy.  Good movie even better time.  I got humiliated in the parking lot, but im over it.  no really i am. drop it dude i am.  Humiliation is a common topic now-a-days that has been said over the news.  These pictures have been described as humilating but as ive thought about it, if we were to get outraged one more time it would just be one more thing to add to the list it seems as americans nothing is ever up to par, well if you dont like it then get your head out of your ass and go change the situation, if you dont like it do something about it.  You want to change it go over there and start holding hands around flag poles or going to the prisons and shake your finger in the soldiers faces, the soldiers who are doing this on free will to protect yours, your free will.  Your free will is something that they care so much about that they are risking their lives so you will still have it.  So the least we can do is support them let them keep doing what they have been doing.  good god i hate people who complain about shit and then dont do anything about it.  a comedian who i enjoy watching perform his craft wrote this on his website.  " I don't want to hear about Bush's outrage.  You can't be outraged at pictures when you have sent people over there to kill.  Humilation sucks and is wrong, but death is even worse, jackass.  My favorite part of this is it is glossing over an even larger prisoners rights issue.   The issue of the hundreds of "War combatants" that we have detained in Cuba, who may never see trial.  And that outrage can be directed specifically at the president and John Ashcroft.   Since we are holding them in Cuba (by the way, why can our Government do buisness with Cuba, but it's citizens cannot?) they are not subject to the rights of those in Jail in America.  Nice loophole.  And now Bush, et. al are saying we do not have to give them a trial until "the war on terrorism is over"  Well, how do you decide when that is?  You don't.  Just another wonderful loophole.   You want to be outraged at the denial of basic rights to prisoners, fine, but how about you start with those that are being held indefinatley without a trial."  that just says it all, and with that, im done for the day.  more to come in the future.

      Sigh I'm tired ya'll,grounds keepin at the zoo aint no joke.  "Manuel" labor and no I didn't spell that wrong I mean someone named Manuel (Mexicans) should be doing this shit.  Sunburns suck so much ass and no I remember why I never was tan because I always fuckin burn I swear to god I'm part Irish minus the red hair which is good because people with red hair freak me out.  But I'm so tired when I get home I end up falling asleep in the shower which I did about 30 minutes ago and fell over and hit my head and now I have a big headache, so I got that going for me.  What else, ummmm my neck is bright red and if I put my hand on it I can feel the heat coming off of it.  My hands are cut up.  My knees and back are screaming with pain all the time, and my shoes and socks are ruined.  So, right on people but its all ok just as long as I get paid.  It doesn't help that I always have the urge to talk to Courtney for like 3 hours on the phone before we go to bed.  But I would rather talk to her than sleep, shies great.  Last night I went to her house and evan locked his keys in his car and it was fun trying to break into it felt bad for him for more than one reason though hes a cool guy. So I guess that's all for today I'm gonna go take a nap, later.

      pretty sure the only one that reads this is courtney which is ok. because shes the coolest.  So i worked for the first time today, i mean WORKED, i got worked.  I trimmed so many trees and everything my knees are shot from standing on an angle by the lake.  but weds night i hung out with courtney and it was by far the best time ive had with someone in a long time.  Im becomming really attached to her and im probably going to flip out when she goes to spain for a month and then is gone some other place after that.  Im gonna just go insane.  Im so glad were back together and its almost like i cant get enough of her, is this love? yeah little unsure on the big L-BOMB there but whatever it is im really enjoying it.

      So yes, the last two entries do contradict each other probably as badly as possible.  That was how I was feeling that day very indecisive.  But its all ok now because were going to start all over.  So lets give a round of applause for Courtney and her patience and understanding for me and my behavior.

      First off, you know how much I hate the things I do to people sometimes? No you don't. Don't think you do because it impacts me much more than it looks like.  Secondly, Courtney I'm sorry, for everything.  Thirdly, everyone else who resents me for my actions this weekend, I'm sorry, for everything.  Courtney there was no easy way to do that. I'm sorry it came to that I'm sorry that it got that far I'm sorry that you had to put up with me. I'm sorry for everything that I did.  Most of all I'm sorry that I hurt you.  You may not understand my actions, me either, but all I knew was that if I didn't do it then it was only going to be harder and more damaging if I waited.  So I know you may not think of it as the right thing now, but trust me it would of been a hell of a lot worse if I had drawn it out.  I'm sorry if I played with your emotions. I'm sorry if you hate me now.  I think what I did was the right thing no matter what, and I feel guilty for it which is wrong, for me to feel bad for doing I'm my mind was right.  I just wish it could of been different. But what's in the past is in the past and what was said was said, maybe you'll forgive me someday, we'll see. Maybe I just need to move on,  maybe.  Maybe I just need to stop saying sorry and do something about it, maybe.  Maybe tomorrow will be different, maybe.  Maybe I did everything right, yeah....maybe.

      maybe i should elaborate on that last post.  i hung out with courtney tonight before she left for the weekend and i gave her a bloody nose, go me.  I felt horrible but i made it up to her and we hung out with sabrina and matt, two people who seemed cool enough to me.  we played some games on courtney's purple gamecube which i absolutly despise and want to drop kick because its a gamecube.  but i really had fun besides i made her bleed and had to bring her mc.donalds which she never paid me back for.  I had fun though and i'll miss her this weekend when shes in lexington for something.  I swear that girl is involved in so much stuff its amazing because i do nothing but work and lay around. but shes great and im happy that shes happy even though i was a spaz tonight and couldnt calm down its the A.D.D. i made her watch the red sox game or turn the tv off and she chose the tv off which was fine because they were losing in the first inning but its the bottom of the 5th and the sox are up 7 to 5, they can pull it off. well im gonna go watch the rest of the game and then go to bed and then go to work and then go home and then go watch tv and then go sleep and then go to work and then go home on and then..................................... sigh its a never ending cycle.

            Why hello America and or whoever reads this, how are we.  You know what has not been mentioned in the news lately is those priests and their alter "boy toys".  I love how they HAD to make a law about that. What the fuck, you get fired at papa johns for that kind of shit but come on down to the church were lenient on that whole molesting thing.  Although I can justify the priests actions, I'm not saying they were right and morally ok I'm just saying its not so smart to put grown men who cant marry or have sex around little boys all the time, and there is going to be a shit-load of wine involved. Imagine what would happen if they wouldn't let dog catchers marry, sure it would take some time, but somewhere there would be a very uncomfortable poodle.          Recently Courtney and I have been hanging out a lot which is cool because this weekend she will be gone and then 2 weeks she will be going to Spain so I'm trying to spend as much time with her as possible because she's amazing and I'm really happy for once in my life so I'm gonna keep on keepin on.  Plus its a true test to see if there is really a connection when you have no power and nothing to do but just talk which is a test we passed so rock on. I like her even though she does get me in trouble, its ok she owes be big time now. Alright faithful readers its time for me to depart so until next time goodbye and god-speed

      26 days = 1560 hours = 93600 minutes = 5616000 seconds.  I can do it if I take it by the seconds almost 120 of those has passed in the time it took to do all that math.   that's 4 Sundays, 4 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, 4 Wednesdays 3 Thursdays, 3 Fridays, and 4 Saturdays.  Evan thinks that it'll be good, in the long run.    armatage101: take something away, and you show what you have  I think just taking her away for like 2 or 3 days would of been enough but I guess I should be glad its not 27 or 28. Its just so hard to think positive right now.  I just hope she has fun. I'll find stuff to do around here.  I just need to keep my mind from wondering back to her it shall not be a fun time but I cant do anything about it I can just email her and think about her.  The 7th shall be my 4th because it will celebrate my independence from the depression that I am already feeling imprison my mind and spirit.  I love her and I'd love for her to be in Evansville where I know she's safe.

      she's not even gone yet and i already want her to come home. I miss her so much it pains for me to think, about anything.  What i'll miss most, is having someone to talk to, after talking to someone every day for more than a month about everything and someone you hang out with almost every day its just really hard to have them taken away from you for 26 days its just not all that fun, i dont recommend it to anyone.  i can make it through i'll just find stuff to do, its only almost 4 weeks, i can do it........can't I?

      dear god, im really questioning god right now because if everything has a purpose, what the fuck is the purpose of poison ivy????????? sweet mother of god  it really makes me want to start hacking away at my ankle and wrist because yeah it sucks that much.  ive never had it before i miss those days.  my wrist has like a huge line of it and a couple of little spots of it.  ive had it for like a week and a half and it hurts more now then it did when i first got it.  i have bug bites all over too.  A plus side to my job though is the fact that im making money and getting tan which is a first in like 8 years for me because im not a real big "tanner" i kind of like it minus the farmers tan situation which is really not all that cool at all.  but i think for the first time, ever, my hands are tan which is really weird for me because ive never seen that on my own body before.        So yesterday i went all over the east side looking for courtney and katie and betsy which started out at the mall where i walked around for 30 minutes and just ended up giving up home and started to drive home when i realized i was thirsty so i pulled into the hucks on lynch and green river and thought i call betsy just to make sure they werent still there. at this time i was informed of how they were seeing evan at his work so i drove on over there and become informed by evan about how i just missed them.  sweet mother of god was that frustrating so i got a really big drink and drove home.        Evan is a pretty cool guy, we have a lot of the same sense of humor.  we want to make our own version of mystery science theater 3000 but the details of this adventure have yet to be worked out.      At courtney's last night we watched monster, a really gay movie which depressed the hell out of me and we made cookies and cupcakes and i whipped up a couple of my world famous grilled cheese's for a few of the people there i have to say they were a few of my best ones yet.  courtney bought me stuff too which made it easy to realize shes the coolest person ever.   yeah man its gonna suck when she goes to spain but im sure youve already heard me go on and on about the situation, what can you do though just suck it up and embrace the time we have together thats about it.  i think thats a long enough post for today

      Today i got mulch thrown on me because i said jonny cash was gay.  Then the kid who threw it proceded to tell me how i was wrong.  I then added that we were in america and i could say what ever the fuck i wanted about whoever the fuck i wanted. Then he said but youd get persecuted and thats so wrong.  I just went off on him then and lost control i dont remember exactly what i said but i think it was about how he was a hypocrite because he just persecuted me by throwing mulch on me.  He just got really pissed that he was wrong and i just went back to shoveling mulch.  Later in the day he kept making snide little remarks to me and so when we were emptying the limbs in the truck i threw as many as i could at him, which was really funny.  I hate my job and the kid i work with.

      whew i played 18 holes of golf with my dad today some guy they paired us up with. I realized very quickly why i stopped playing.  I suck.  I hate that game and i refuse to play.  I stopped playing after Courtney called me and i just got really depressed.  I miss her so much.  I hope she comes home safely and i get to see her really really soon.  Last night a family member of mine came home a little "tipsy" and it really pissed me off.  I just always thought of them in a better light then slurring their speech and making random comments about t-shirts and laundry mats.  I just hate alcohol and the person it brings out in some people.  I got pissed at them and went to bed.  Its not right for me to be mad either, they didnt do anything wrong they are of legal drinking age.  Its just not in good taste to get plastered when your here to see your relatives.  (they were asleep when they got home). Thats all for today I miss courtney and i want the next 18 days to go by fast so i can just be around her.  i hope i can go see her at the airport because i really really really really really really miss her and love her quite a lot as well.  Thats enough wallowing for today.  Good day.                                        -Jonathan Hight

      For you, Michael Moore   execution-  \Ex`e*cu"tion\, n. [F. ex['e]cution, L. executio, exsecutio.] 1. The act of executing; a carrying into effect or to completion; performance; achievement; consummation; as, the execution of a plan, a work, etc.  2. A putting to death as a legal penalty; death lawfully inflicted; as,  the execution of a murderer.   Our soldiers arent being killed, they are being executed....daily.  Doesnt seem right does it, it doesnt seem right that our soldiers are being executed daily and we are court-marshiling people for "taunting and treating enemy POW's unfairly".   one thing i dont care for is seeing our miltary's soldiers getting their head's chopped off, or executed in any way. so for you michael moore, a man who is trying to turn his country against its leader, fuck you.....fuck you, you fascist bastard. If you dont like our country, so what, leave! dont like our leaders, dont vote for them.  obviously a lot more people like him than hate him otherwise he wouldnt of been elected!!!! and dont pull the flordia recount shit on me. thats fucking gay he won fair and Al Gore knows it too that "internet inventing" pompus ass-clown. jesus christ.  Michael Moore get a life. HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF CRITIZING THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THIS COUNTRY, HOW ABOUT CHANGING IT, INSTEAD OF TRICKING POLITICIANS INTO LOOKING LIKE ASSES BY TRYING TO GET THEIR CHILDREN TO GO TO THE WAR IN IRAQ WHY DONT YOU GO, ITS FAT ASSES LIKE YOU THEY NEED ON THE FRONT LINE TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE BULLETS.  if you dont think its right change it dont just complain to america about it.  our president was handed a note that was not inteded for the public to see, that told him iraq's government had been turned over and you know what he wrote on it?  he wrote  "  let freedom reign  "  thats a man who truly cares about his country.  he did that not as a publicity stunt but to show how he truly wants this world to be.  he cares, a president that cares, nice eh?  but we dont apreciate him with movies that show how great of a guy he is, we destroy his image and make him look like an ass.  back the fuck off of him hes doing the best he fucking can michael moore.  what have you done today besides eat 8 times you fat oaf.  so for michael if you can make those movies and books i can make these posts so all of you who complain about this, i dont give a fuck.  its just that simple...........get the point?  in the eternal, infamous, words of Evan-  Semper fi bitch.

      ok im just going to start this post off by saying i will be posting twice, two seperate ideas one is my daily post of what activites i acomplished today and a new post basicly where i get on my soapbox and go off on a tangent and let my mind go red and my fingers do the typing.  ok so for the what i did today, i got picked up by evan and we went out to USI to play frisbee golf, which is a lot of fun and i will most certainly play again in the comming days.  then we drove over to the west side schlotkzi's deli and evan tried to use his street cred to get some 1/2 price food. needless to say, he failed miserably, even managing to make himself and me look like an ass by a woman who said, and i quote "not in your dreams" this was said of course after making a condescending look at me like i asked for some outragious demand like free petroluim, even though Evan was the only one who requested the discounted food and i stood there shaking my head almost saying out loud "dude, its not going to work, let it go." then we went to the mall and he got some chik-fila which i watched him eat and on the way home we talked about the DMAT, more on the DMAT over at his blog......http://www.evman.blogspot.com/ Enjoy that. then i went home, napped, and went to guitar lessons and then came home, watched some reno 911 and now im here. preparing myself for the attacks i cant wait to unleash on michael moore.

      Today i went to the mall with will, the drive over there was fun, Will did better than i thought he would keeping up with me though, so Will mad props.  As we got there we walked around and we both got some hats mine say pimpletown PIMPS and another one that says MOUNT' EM and then went to best buy and Will got a Beastie Boys C.D. and i got Wonder Whats Next by Chevelle  which by the way is a really good cd and i recomend for everyone.  So then i went to hucks on lynch and i saw the coolest thing ever they have a seperate drink nozzle for the flavorings like cherry or vanilla. im sure this is all something you all have seen before but it totally blew me away so i got a 44oz cup of cherry flavoring.  Mighty Tasty.   I talked to courtney on the internet today it was kinda sureal it blew my mind because i hadnt talked to her online in such a long time it was weird to actually do that again.  So i guess thats all for today and im gonna go play some fight night 2004 before i have to take it back tonight later ya'll

      If you comment in my blog, don't be gay, leave a name. Don't be ashamed of your comments, be proud of what you have to say, I know I am. I rarely say something I wish I hadn't.  That's a reason why I have this blog, to say what I am dying to share with everyone without typing it out 7 times, I can just put it on here. I don't know who all reads my blog.  I quite frankly have no idea.  So lets start this if you read my blog as of now let me know, IM me blinkguitarist21 and just say hey, I read your blog (insert what you think of it here) I might ask you for suggestions, I might not.  You can also email me at blinkguitarist21@netscape.net  I'm not mad at all I just am curious to know how many people actually do read this thing and if its worth the work I'm putting into it.  Which isn't much.  Also tell me if even if its entertaining and what topics you would like for me to tackle next. But hey, that's just...How I roll.

      You know in my past posts I've made comments on many things like president Bush.  I really do like the man and I support him.  But as a whole Id like to criticize America now.  David Cross has a comedy album out thats called   It's Not Funny  .  on that he has a track where he talks about a restaurant in the Trump building called " Jean Georges " and he talks about this desert he had where he describes it as a "hand-carved chocolate mountain"  and on top? a real sheet of real gold.  Tasteless, odorless gold. TO EAT!!!! and he says something something that is so unbeliveably true that it just blows my mind.  he says " and i thought wow man if that isnt the ultimate FUCK YOU to poor people i dont know what is, that is an awesome gesture of fuck you, poor people"  and i thought not only is that a FUCK YOU to poor people, i wonder what kind of a image that sends out to other countries who have like 98% of their population is starving and were EATING FUCKING GOLD!!!!!! when is this shit going to stop.  COME ON PEOPLE.  I KNOW WHY OTHER COUNTRYS HATE US, WERE EATING GOLD!!!! NOT ONLY ARE WE EATING IT, WERE SHITING IT OUT TOO! JESUS CHRIST PEOPLE.  NEXT TIME YOU WONDER WHY COUNTRIES HATE US JUST THINK OF TWO PEOPLE SITTING DOWN IN NEW YORK EATING FUCKING GOLD ON DESSERT!!!!  true it is a free country and its not right for me to judge and if they want to eat gold whos to say they cant.  but seriously where is the line and how long to these rich bastards cross it?

       As a Boston fan you have to appreciate the underdogs. In the American League its good ol Boston Red Sox, in the national league its the Cubbies. These fans appreciate eachothers clubs and respect one another. Which is why in the National League, my team to watch is the Cubs. But this is easily changed if a red sox game is on. I am a true Red Sox fan. I'll watch them in thick and thin and support them all the way. Which leads me to my next point, Nomar Garciaparra, will be now wearing a cubs uniform at his new home, Wrigley Field. In the windy city, NOMAHHHH IN THE WINDY CITY. Hardly seems possible, right? WRONG. It happened, and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it doesn't seem right to see Nomar in that uniform, he only belongs in Boston. On the other hand, its not that devastating of a loss. His performance lately has been less than spectacular. He didn't even play for a great deal of the season, because of injuries. He was my favorite Boston player, so as a fan for Nomar, and the Red Sox, I'm also now a Cubs fan. (its not like they are in the same division or something) Now before you jump to conclusions let me explain myself. I am not exactly a "Cubs" fan, I'm a Nomar fan, who he just so happens to play for the Cubs now. I like the Cubs, I'm just not as big of a fan as say......Evan, for example. I'm not ditching the Red Sox not at all, I'm just adopting a second team to watch and enjoy. Yes, today I did buy a Cubs hat, in support of Nomar. I'm a Red Sox fan, just with a hobby of watching the Cubs. But, for Boston I'd like to say for the last time, NOMAHHHH!!!!

      Three baseball fans are walking home from a game at friendly Fenway Park.  One is wearing a Red Sox cap, the second one is wearing an Indians cap, and the third one is wearing a Yankees cap.  As they are walking down Commonwealth Avenue, they see a pair of legs sticking out from under a bush. Upon further inspection, they find that it is a totally naked dead woman.  A crowd starts to gather before the police arrive, so they decide to give the woman some vestige of dignity. The first one places his Red Sox cap over her left breast. The second one places his Indians cap over her right breast. The third one places his Yankees cap over her crotch.  The police arrive to investigate. The detective picks up the Red Sox cap for a moment, takes a quick look, writes a few things in his notepad, then puts the cap back on her breast. He picks up the Indians cap, takes a quick look, writes a few things in his notepad, then puts the cap back on her other breast. He picks up the Yankees cap, takes a quick look, starts to write in his notepad, but stops and scratches his head for a moment, with a puzzled look on his face. Then he kneels down real close, sticks his fingers in the womans crotch, spreading it open and staring.  Now one of the baseball fans yells at him: “Hey, what are you some kind of pervert?”  To this the officer replies: “Oh, no, of course not. I just need to double check because every other Yankees cap I’ve ever seen had an ASSHOLE under it!”    Q: How do you make a Yankee fan laugh on Monday?  A: Tell him a joke on Friday!    Q: What did the Yankees fan use for birth control?  A: His personality!   Q: How do you get four Yankees fans to sit on one stool? A: Turn it upside down!

      Just a recap of recent funny events because I havent posted in a while,  So at work my supervisor was swinging around these bee traps, and calling himself GO GO, while doing this he slamed the trap against his elbow and left a big circle cut and bruise which made me laugh for about half an hour.  2 weeks ago i was driving home from going to the YMCA as i was sitting on first ave in traffic  i look in my rear view mirror and to my delight, in the car behind me........a rather large girl was not only singing, but yes, dancing to her radio.  she was really into it too which made it even harder to look away.  Last night at applebee's our waitor was the best waitor ive had in a long time because of his brutal honesty the conversation was as such..... Waitor- can i get you guys something to drink? Evan- I'll have some iced tea Me- which one of your lemonades to you recommend? Waitor- "Honestly? our lemonades suck ass they are bitter and discusting and are just gross" Me- awesome, I'll have a mountain dew.  Honesty like that is very very refreshing, like lemonade.  school sucks, that goes without saying.  I got whipped in the eye with some whisteria ( a vine) from my boss, Craig (A.K.A. GO GO) while I was driving in the gay park at work, he was in the bed of the truck and it whipped it into my window and hit my cornea.....fun times.  Misty, my other boss today asked me to come to a party at her house on friday, i dont know if i should go because i hate my one boss, Beth with a passion.  A collection of my co-workers want to carve Beth's phone number on a table in the gay park and have above it "Call for a good time ask for Kyle" thats her fiance......poor guy.  I just realized i have a lot of bosses.  I shall list them, Beth, the bitch.  Misty, the nice one.  Craig the one i like/GO GO.  Paul the horniculturist expert. and Dan mcgin, the main curator.  Beth and Misty and Craig are more "supervisors" than bosses.   Buffalo Wild Wings on the East side is too small.   Anyone else extreamly intreagued with the Gillette M3 power razor?  I want to go fishing soon........or a otters game..........  I cant buy anything for the next two weeks in order to get an ipod........ugh.  Ive got nothing else.
