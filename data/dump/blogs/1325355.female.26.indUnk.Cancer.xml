      Hello ladies!  Just wanted to wish everyone a wonderful turkey day! I've been thoroughly enjoying my week off...oh how this weekend will be so hard getting back into the swing of things. Only a few short weeks left till the end of another semester-wheee! Currently I'm working on setting up rotations, geez I can't believe it's time...I've also been working diligently on this essay to get into MD Anderson's oncology rotation...eek the pressure!  Oh Carolina, I'm sorry to hear about your honey's cholesterol...the nice thing is with healthy diet & exercise your honey will get those numbers down in no time...it'll be fine! By the way did his doctor give him the break down as far as what his LDL vs HDL was? Just curious. I hope you guys do indulge a little during the holidays despite the news!    My honey is in the great state of Oklahoma...spending T-Day with his parents..ahh he's such a sweet-face-head! "Well folks", as they say around here anyway, I'm signing off for now as I sip on my glass of cheap red wine & do a lil' reading. Take care, D

      I'm still here!  Hope you have fun in the Valley, Carol!  If Killy really wants to get healthy, he should have brown rice instead of white ;P  Hey, how do we upload photos that aren't on the web? Do you know how to do the "amazing upload thing" that the boys use?  I think everyone's just busy with the holidays, Carol -- talk to you after T-Day -- Hope you get lots of yummy gobble, gobble, etc.

       my love has high cholesterol   So one of the things that my lovely husband learned when he was sick is that he has high cholesterol.  Now he can't enjoy all the junk food he grew up on.  I offered to make him some white rice with stir fried broccoli (mostly steamed) and he almost cried. It broke my heart too, but we are both eating healthier as a result. Last night, we had baked chicken, spinach salad, asparagus and steamed potatoes.  For desert, we languished by the fireplace and enjoyed some cholesterol free white cake with mexican hot chocolate with skim milk, yummm, and watched Terminator 3.  I love winter.  I wish it was cold longer here.  This way I could justify investing in some really nice and fun sweaters and coats. But no luck. Texas can be so drab.....

      THANKSGIVING  I am looking forward to a six hour drive to the Rio Grande Valley on Wednesday.  Once there, we will check into the Echo Hotel and Conference Center for the night.  The next day, we travel to my brother's house for the cooking and the hanging out that happens before dinner.  I grew up in a house where Thanksgiving dinner took place at Midnight.  My husband thinks this is wierd.  I think his family is wierd for having Thanksgiving dinner at 11:00 in the morning (What?!?!).  The idea is, he explains, we have time to digest our first attempt so we could hit the leftovers later.  I am used to hanging out and dancing all day, cooking all afternoon, dancing some more, drinking some  sangrias  or some  ollitas  and then relaxing to a wonderful dinner late into the night.  Then we stay up singing on the guitar and dancing some more, friends and family gathered all around.  The girls in the kitchen cleaning and the guys in the living room trying to best each other on the guitar or the guys in the kitchen cleaning and girls in the living room watching them and laughing.  In any case, my brother, Fidel, has four kids, FOUR.  There is Cesar Emanual, Lisa Marie, Felipe and Jason.  They are all cute and adorable and WILD.  My brother and his wife are wonderful happy people.  His wife stays home and watches the kiddies and my brother works for the city.  There is no way to describe their little house.  It is CHOCK FULL of STUFF.  I swear, they seem to collect everything.  I remember at one point he had about three VCRs that he'd collected and fixed scattered about the house.  Fidel has an incredible collection of matchbox cars.  He has had them as far back as I remember.  He also has a historic collection of record albums that are ancient and probably worth lots of money.  I'm sure he has something in that house that is worth tons of money, but isn't even aware of it.    Anyway, the Chavez family will bring the Turkey and potatoes and cooking wine.  The Singleterrys will join us there and they will bring desert.  The Mercados will provide the sides.  I figure we'll spend all day cooking and making a mess while the kids play with the mountain of toys Fidel has collected over the years and go wild with so many visitors.  I'm sure there will be a crying or screeching kid at various points throughout the day.  Lina will periodically go outside to bury potato skins or onion peelings under her garden patch and may come back inside with a papaya or melon or something.  Fidel will inevitably be sent to the nearest HEB to pick up some last minute things, butter, vegetable oil, salt, at least three times.  At some point, I will take the kiddies for a walk around the neighborhood but will hurry back when the neighbors rabid dogs threaten to jump out of their little yards and rip us to pieces.  Then, afternoon will start to set in.  The TV will be blaring some popular Disney movie in Spanish and the kids will been scolded many times throughout the day, Lina will have pulled out her big bib and will begin to give free haircuts all around.  Her littlest will take the broom and sweep up the cut hair and the second to the littlest will get the dustpan.  Lina will be angry at whoever tries to wash her dishes.  You know , she will tell us in Spanish,  you will keep me in the poor house for washing my dishes.   The early evening approaches, we are all hungry, we are all grabbing seats and food and eating and feeding our offspring as best we could.  The house is still a mess from the cooking, but all that will be taken care of soon.  Another movie is playing on the t.v., exhuastion sets in.  Killy and I are the first to leave, we will be driving back home tomorrow.  We hit the hotel and rest in preparation for another 6 hours on the road tomorrow.  That's that!

      Well I hope you all know what I've done to my poor spouse. I've abused him, injured him to the point that he had to go to the ER-6 stitches in the end. Carolina knows this because our husbands were comparing stories about the ER, while Taggart was in the ER. So, the scab is healing, I got to take the stitches out, that was fun. He doesn't miss an opportunity to tell me how much he loves me, then make some cruel joke about how clumsy I am, or how he promises not to let his face get in the way of the hatchback again. I love being married!  Just saw Love Actually-it was cute, but not that cute.  I'm reading a book now, (Diana may be interested) about the metaphysics of healing. Being in the healing industry and all....I got to see 3 surgeries today, and you know what? I think anesthiologists are the nicest of em all. I learned so much from them today. I was kind of surprised. OK, you want to hear something funny-I probably shouldn't say it because then I may have to live up to it. Some nursing students and I are going to train to run a half marathon in Feb. So I think between running and yoga-sounds like a pretty healthy christmas right? Like I said-I probably shouldn't say it because I have been know to HATE running. So I'm crazy-but ambitiously so! Ladies, take care of your men-they need it. Don't use my case as an excuse to slam your man's face with the trunk of the car. It's not worth it.

      Just read the DaVinci Code. I really enjoyed reading this one too!  It was a fast read, I normally don't get into thriller/mysteries, had a bad experience with them when I was at HCCH.  But this one was well done, quick, exciting and fun!    The pace of the book was such that the story threatened to veer out of control to crash and burn.  I was afraid the author would be forced to bail out with some some cheesy, easy guess disclosure.  But, fortunately, that never really happened.  In any case, besides keeping me awake late with it's fast pace, I was continually intrigued with mind tickling anagrams and word puzzles.  Although my curiousity was piqued with these superb word games, my devotion to the read was solidified with interesting anecdotes.  Among these interesting tid-bits, I learned that  urlLink Walt Disney was a member of the Masonic Service Association of North America. .  Also, and most importantly, the unfolding of the mystery regarding the  urlLink divine feminine .    Obviously, this is sensitive subject matter.  There are many  urlLink opposing views  posted all over the web about the historical accuracy of the book and what constitutes  urlLink Dan Brown's agenda  for publishing it.  Personally, I enjoyed having my curiousity awakened enough to get me running to the nearest Borders books for some fun research.   Amber, this  urlLink one's  for you.   With this subject matter in mind, this is certainly a book for you to read, if you haven't yet. A review of the Da Vinci Code by  urlLink pop matters .  Read more  urlLink reviews .  Politics:  urlLink I'm closest to Bugs Bunny .

      Carol, if we were to make a new cookbook today with all our new-found wisdom, would it not far exceed in taste and indulgences our previous satisfactorily delicious yet culinarily sophomoric effort?  I have so many better recipes now!!  If only I knew then what I know now.  Souffles, spices, truffles, how to keep eggplant from becoming bitter, how to keep green veggies green, how to make risotto creamy, how to fry a seafood batter to a light golden delicious brown without having it fall apart in the oil, how to make your own curry powder, how to braise lamb shanks, how to make mousse stay fluffy instead of becoming heavy and pudding-like, I could go on and on ... I think we should have our own cooking show ...

      Breakfast Recipe 1 whole wheat tortilla 1 slice low fat turkey 2 egg whites 1/4 cup chopped green and yellow zuchini 1/4 cup chopped onion and tomato 1/4 cup chopped spinach pinch parmesan cheese  Spray some cooking oil into a non stick omelet pan.  Over a medium flame, heat slice turkey 10 seconds on each side.  Remove from heat.  Spray lo-fat cooking oil into pan again.  Over a low flame, toss in green and yellow zuchini and cook for 20 seconds stirring, add chopped onion and tomato, cook for 20 seconds, stirring continually.  Add chopped spinach, cook for 10 seconds stirring continually.  Finally, add egg whites and a pinch of parmesan cheese, stir and cover.  Allow to cook for about 20 seconds, then flip. Heat tortilla and add turkey slice, top with omelet mixture. You can top this with pico, salsa, or just plain cilantro (I love cilantro with this).  Salsa All my salsas are real basic.  I never use oil so it is all lo-fat.  Fresh tomatoes, any kind, I usually use large slicing tomatoes. Any pepper, fresh or dried, whatever you want to try, for breakfast salsa, I use jalapenos. If you want it less spicy, *remove the seeds from the peppers. If you want it to be a little spicy but palatable, use less peppers. Salt  Breakfast Salsa Two large slicing tomatoes cut into four chunks each. Jalapeno peppers, See  spice  chart below - For my  white  homies- 1 pepper per tomato - For breakfast- 2 peppers per tomato plus 1 extra - For Killy and gatherings - 3 peppers per tomato - For me - 4 peppers per tomato and a GIANT bag of potato chips (I don't like this salsa with tortilla chips)  In a medium pot, place tomatoes and peppers add water to cover all.  Bring to a boil, let boil for 1 and a half minutes.  In a blender, place peppers first (they have tougher skin and will need to be closest to the blades to be chopped up enough, or else you'll get a green chunk that can be pretty painful and/or embarrasing depending on the company), then place cooked tomatoes on top.  Add salt now (not later, there's some kind of chemical reaction, I'm sure, that affects the taste if you put it in later.)  Blend on high for just about 10 seconds, not too long at all.  Actually, when you see the cooked tomatoes start to whirl and disintegrate, stop blending now.  If you blend too long, you'll have a soupy salsa.  You want it to be chunky enough to drown your eggs with it and enjoy with tortillas for breakfast.  That's it!   HEY AMBER  Whudja do with our Christmas recipe book we made back in the day???  *In my life experience, I have never removed the seeds

      Hey Diana, the class I go to is open to all levels -- you can take the postures deeper depending on your comfort, flexibility, etc. -- I highly recommend it ... btw, I loved how Todd wrote on the boys blogger that he remembers to take his vitamins every day because you love him!  :>

      My exercise tip is to take advantage of any lil opportunity. My exercise life is very sporadic...I try to walk/run any chance I get which usually amounts to 3 miles/wk & whenever I have the apartment to myself I dance for an hour or so otherwise that's it. I try doing the little things like parking far away from the grocery store, taking the stairs & streching daily etc. hoping it all adds up somehow. Amazingly enough I am burning calories...I'd like to think it's from all the little modifications of my daily habits but hours of studying may be playing a part in all this. Amber's Bikram yoga sounds so cool...is this something you have to work up to? I am considering joining a kick boxing class that one of my classmates is going to be instructing this spring! As far as good books go, I haven't had time for elective reading but in 10 days I'll have the entire week off for Turkey day...& will read The Feast of Love, a book I picked up months ago. I'll let ya'll know how it goes. I'll have to give Liz's suggestion a try as well.  Amber good luck with class that sounds like so much fun! Wow!  Well back to learning opioids! Take care, D

      oh, yeah, I'm looking for interesting new breakfast ideas. The criteria:  must be low sugar, low carb, healthy, and fast. Any ideas?  Carol, can you give me a good pico de gallo or chunky salsa recipe to go with eggs (only mildly spicy)?

      That virus Killy has sounds so awful!! Anthony is having second thoughts about being a dad now ... I'm sure he'll get over that within a day or so and start pestering me again about when we're gonna have ourselves a Junior ... wait, isn't it usually the woman who's clock starts tick-tock-ticking first?  I finally made it to yoga and made up for my slouching by doing Bikram yoga, which is a style that involves very fast transitions in a room heated to 95-100 degrees -- so you sweat like mad and lose every bit of retained water by the end of it -- just what I needed.  Wish me luck this weekend -- I'm teaching an orchid class at the New York Botanical Gardens and have 40 students signed up already -- the biggest class I've taught up 'till now only had 20 students!!  yikes!!  I'm gettin' a little noivous  ovah hea'  (that's my imitation of a new york accent) ...Ciao!

      Hello Ladies! I made it 2nd time around-its nice to be among "just girls"! Unfortunately my life seems less exciting with the every day hum drum of study..eat...study....eat.....study......eat & repeat.   Carolina, what a chaotic day you had-geez..you should get mom/wife/worker of the year or something. I hope Killy is recovering well & baby forgiving you of the night alone when you were in Raleigh.   Liz-How is school going? The good news is...the holidays are almost here...yeah! How is Austin life treating you? I can't wait to fly home this Christmas..I can't believe 7mos have already passed since I've been here. WOW.   All ya'll need to come up here. It is so beautiful..lil chilly though. I've made it a ritual now to warm up by my baseboard heater as soon as I come home from school. Katie, my roommate makes fun of how warm I keep my room. My love sent me goose down slippers just in time so I stay pretty toasty. Todd is such a sweetie! I miss him so....  Well ladies have wonderful evenings...I have an early practical exam tom.-blah.

         OH I read that book!  I was a member of some obscure book club that would periodically send out FREE books to read.  I don't remember what book club that was and I lost touch with them for a while now, but that was one of the books I got for free. I love the part about the guy who collects specimens with a swab and stores them in bottles.  Didn't he carry them around in a briefcase?  I can't remember all the details now, but it really was a great book.  Memoirs of a Geisha.

      Liz, Tell about your weekend! All,  My big beautiful husband went to the emergency room Sunday morning, 'bout 3 am or so.  He had been complaining of fever and sores in his mouth.  Turns out, the baby gave him some baby virus that spawned into some giant contagious yucky monster yuck in my honey's beautiful being.  Of course, I was tired and worried about my job since I worked from home on Friday (work??? - yeah right...).  Seems my mother in law thought it was her day off or something.  All sorts of errands and all sorts of last minute emergencies that required her to be off and running throughout the day leaving baby crying for mommy's attention all day.  Not only was it impossible for me to be the ideal employee with screeching angel hanging on my knees, but I was a complete failure as the loving doting mommy because of the many work related fires burning out of control with my absence and a less than perfect caring and supportive wife to my sick husband with all of this going on.  AAARRGGGHHH.  I finally practically screamed for relief and help when grandma came home about 2:00 pm with yet another list of errands to run!!! WAIT a minute!  My husband is deathly ill...I couldn't very well leave my feverish contagious husband with the baby this morning when you went to  "drop Barbara off at school"  only to not be back until well after 10:00 am.  By then, I was already trying to stomp out a fire taking place at work via email.  So I couldn't very well leave everything up in the air while I take the half hour ride into the office.  Who knows what could have happened during that time.  Only to find you rushing out the door for a lunch date with your daughter.  See, my husband stayed home because he was sick.  I stayed home because you weren't here, but I am supposed to be at work.  All I need is ONE HOUR to put out ANOTHER fire.   OH...  I'm sorry mijita.  I will take the baby for a walk.  which she did.  But while I was fixing problem number 2, I had completely neglected my daily responsibilities which will only pile up on me for a Monday catch up session.  BUT WAIT!  Giant fire number THREE!!! and the day is almost gone and the baby and grandma are back  I just need to got pick up Barbara from school.  Should I take the baby with me?  Baby screeching for me to pick him up - he still hasn't forgiven me for leaving him for the one night I needed to be in Raleigh Brow is sweating, a meeting room is double booked, fifteen people flying in all over US to the meeting I am responsible for.  HUGE headache.  Please take him with you.  Found other meeting space, great price, notify everyone, make hotel changes, arrange car pools. Grandma is back with Barbara.  Carol, Mom wants to know if she should bring the baby in now... Not yet please  Grandma walks in with sleeping baby who promptly wakes up and spies me talking on the phone with my boss.  No, everything is OK..  I found a meeting room right down the street.  We got a previously canceled room at a great price.  Lunch will be...  Grandma sneaks back out with now screeching baby. Barbara rushes out in a thick fog of sickeningly sweet Victoria's Secret perfume Sudden stabbing guilt at the thought of subjecting my baby to such environmental hazards. It's past 4 and everyone in Raleigh is gone for the day, can't do much else but stress for the rest of the weekend, which I proceeded to do without hesitation. Go and hug my husband for the 45 seconds I have before baby gets home SCREECHING for me. Love love kiss kiss, feel better baby... Baby is home, screeching resumes, hug hug, kiss kiss, chase chase, growl growl, giggle giggle, read read, bathe bathe, sleep sleep...  3 am  That was Friday.  Saturday will follow.....

      I just got home from work at the Banana...I didn't buy anything today, I'm so proud! usually I'll buy whatever damaged stuff they have for like $5, then try to fix it. It's funny though, since I can't really even sew on a button. Carol, while you give your son a bath, Taggart gives our dog a bath...he talks to him, washes his hair, he gets so muddy so he gets a bath like once a week. That ceviche recipe was making my mouth water...gotta try it, but it won't be as good as yours. THat sweet potato stuff, Amber, mmmmmmm. Thankfully, I have three sweet potatoes (about 2 months old) but still good! I'll fix em up soon.  Frozen pizza is so easy though....Actually, all this stress from school has made me lose weight. I better make sure the frozen pizza doesn't catch up though! Yoga tomorrow!!! Taggart even likes it now! what a man.  If you haven't read memoirs of a Geisha yet, do it. one of my favorite books.

      HELLO GIRLS! I'm back from traveling yesterday!  Went to a training class at my corporate office in Raleigh, NC yesterday.  It's nice when you can visit some people you work with, take them to lunch, have a nice chat, then leave.  Leave them all behind with their office politics and their water cooler gossip.  Speaking of gossip.  I picked up another book at the airport.  As a newbie traveler, I don't really know what books to get so I am reading lots of jackets, inside covers, looking at what other people are getting.  Not until the morning I was checking out of the hotel did I peruse the complimentary USA Today left at my door and notice   (killy is reading over my shoulder and chuckling about how crazy we are, now he's kissing the back of my head and neck to give him undivided attention)  that there's a book list IN THE USA TODAY!  OK  But for now, I already had a book.  And it was amusing and entertaining.  Yes, I'm one of those people who sit there laughing at the funny parts and expressing all sorts of emotion, albeit quietly, still unashamedly, while reading my book.  There were tears, laughter, excitement and driftwood dolphin sculptures.  Pretty funny book.  I finished reading it in three hours.   The Boy Next Door by  urlLink Meggin Cabot   OK girls, Amber, shame on you.  Liz, get off your butt or you'll end up like me!  The hotel has a gym, I was on the FX machine for half an hour.  For the next half hour, I did all the weight machines that were there. This! at the hotel. I wanted to feel good in my new Victoria's Secret surprise!  So there!  By the way, I am proud to say that I was wearing a size 8 skirt all day yesterday.  And was not uncomfortable one bit.  Recipe, Prepare the day before Prep time, 25 mins Ceviche  3 lb fresh red snapper filet 1 large red tomato 1 large yellow onion 4 deseeded, deveined jalapeno peppers 1 bunch fresh cilantro 4 cups key lime juice 2 small avocados Salt to taste  Night before, in a large freezer bag, place entire red snapper filets and all the key lime juice making sure that all of the flesh is covered in the juice.  Zip and put in refrigerator overnight. 2 Hours before, take the bag of filets out of the fridge, set aside.  Mince all the other ingredients except for the avocado.  Mix together in a medium bowl to make the pico.  Set aside.  Take the filets out of the lime juice.  Separate the flesh from the skin using your fingers (if there was no skin, then just use your fingers to tear the cooked flesh).  This way you make sure there aren't any bones left in it.   Now you mix the snapper and the pico together until fully combined.  Add salt to taste.  With your hands, shape the mixture into an oval.  Use the avocados to create fins or scales. Serve with tostadas and Cholula hot sauce (looks like tabasco). Dark and light dos equis served over ice with a little salt! Yumm!

      I had a million excuses why I couldn't do yoga today -- it's raining, I don't want my yoga mat to get wet, the subway's running too slow, I'll be late, I'm dehydrated, I feel constipated, I exercised on Sunday, etc, etc ... so I'm afraid I'm not as inspirational as I aspired to be today.  Oh, I have a recipe for you, Liz -- I made whipped sweet potatoes the other day with lime and cayenne pepper -- to die for! the lime brings out such a tangy zesty flavor in the sweet potatoes -- an unexpected combo but it works -- just peel sweet potatoes, cut into 2" chunks and drop in boiling water for about 20 minutes or until soft, then put in a bowl and add some butter and a little milk to lighten them up a little, then add lime juice (about 1-2 TBSP for 3 potatoes) and 1 tsp of cayenne (or more if you really like it spicy) -- and then blend/puree in a food processor or with an electric blender -- um, um, goooooood!

      How cool! Good Books...well I haven't read anything but nursing books in a while, and nobody wants to hear about that. I haven't cooked anything in a while either, bad wife syndrome, but I'd love to hear all about easy, cultural recipes. I loved the shots of little Gandalf...and that twirling around on the floor dance, ohmigod-so funny!  I can't wait until thanksgiving-tag and i will be in houston for a couple days so we can visit all the houstonians.  I'm meeting Taggart over at his bosses house, their cooking dinner and drinking (way too much) wine. That should help me deal with my stressed out condition right now.  If I could write in a font that was all squiggly to express my stress, I would. Yoga! I've been going to this great studio in Austin-I hope you girls inspire me to get off my duff and back on my majic yoga mat!

      I love it!!  This is an excellent chance for us to talk about chic stuff: books we love, movies, what we're doing on the weekend, our jobs, our men, our bosses, our gardens, yoga, weird diets, poems we've written, and all the other good stuff that the boys just don't understand.  Aaaaah, I feel so relaxed here -- I think I'll just curl up on a comfy sofa with a cup of honey-chamomile tea and read whatever you brilliant girls come up with next -- scones, anyone?

      Girls. This blog is a safe refuge from the inane chatter currently making up the boys' blog, killyandfriends.  Today marks day one of good, funny, exciting and interesting thought sharing.  This is our opportunity to show our boys that there is more to this good world than a computer and a game of war. So let's go girls! Let's do this thing right!     Check out  urlLink pixeltees.com .

      Spent last night hanging with adolph, amber, diana, todd, brent, killy and killito - we talked to one of the new train conductors - he was excited to talk to interested civilians about the new  urlLink metro  of Houston.  The plan is, spend the night at Adolph's, wake up tomorrow and ride the train up and down houston. woo hoo! I can't wait! So, what are your plans for the new year?  Next year, first thing I gotta do, is look for a new job!  Ask me about it!

Funny guy!  I'm laughing hysterically the whole time!  anyway then Killy got me  urlLink Serve it Forth  by M. F. K. Fisher.  I can't wait to start reading that one! Unfortunately, the only time I really have to read is after the baby is asleep, which can be pretty late sometimes.  And then that means I have to choose between going to sleep or reading.  Hmmm.. I've been coming to work late this week. Speaking of this week. It's so slow here, i just want to choke.  how are you doing?  Oooh Oooh Look at  urlLink this  site!

      hello fellow citizens of the united states - well, maybe not quite yet - but very soon i hope I am completing my application to become a legal citizen of the United States of America! YAY! But FIRST - I have to read a 57 page guide to Naturalization What a strange word. To become naturalized Means  urlLink to bring into conformity with Nature  But it also means  to cause (as a plant) to become established as if native intransitive senses : to become established as if native . Hmmm. So I will be brought to conformity with nature like a native plant. YAY I am a delicate flower of promise.  I will bloom with tomorrow.  But first, I must make my voice heard. I intend to vote in the presidential elections. Wish me luck!

        Hope you had a wonderful christmas I know I did.  My husband and my son gave me a Spa Day at J. Claude's in Montrose. I had a massage for the first time in my life.  I found out I was very flexible (or is that one of the things massoosesses like to tell their clients, like pedicurists who like to tell their clients that they are  so pletty, face so lound ) and that I actually had tension in my back.  I would have never known.  I don't know if it's because I haven't paid attention to me that I have grown into a masochist making pain a normal and everday part of my life or if he was trying to convince me that I needed to come back.  If it was the latter, he didn't have to do that.  All he needed to do was what he did, and that was knead me into a ball of soft putty.  aaahhhhhh My husband does love me after all! It was really nice to have 5 hours of personal attention by people trying to convince me that I wasn't a boring, struggling, working tired out sleepless mom.  But that I was a glamorous gem of unaltered natural beauty and that it was a privilege to be trimming my tresses and softening my cuticles. man oh man If you haven't done it, you really should!  Killy also bought me a really nice digital camera that actually fits into my many mini purses!   I love it! I love it! I love it! And so does Killy.  My sister sacrificed herself to buy me my signature scent, patchouli.  Maru is extremely allergic to processed fragrances and for her to stand in line at a perfume store for this special treat FOR ME because she loves me was a BIG deal.  And I got her a CUTEY little outfit for the holidays!

      Merry Christmas, everyone!!  I remember my mom used to take such good care of me when I would get sick -- she would dote over me and feed me lots of soup and juice and put cool towels on my forehead ... it was so nice and so soothing but eventually I think I actually started to get sick more often just so I could stay home from school and have my mom pay attention to me ... and then I got pneumonia when I was 13.  For the first time, I realized how terrible being sick could be -- I was sick for like 2 or 3 months -- the fever dreams were so spectacular, I still remember those, so vivid and real.  I remember seeing my entire body represented by a gigantic life-size chess board and all the white blood cells in my body were the white chess pieces fighting for good health and the black chess pieces were the pnuemonia growing and festering in my lungs -- I was coughing and in bed for what seemed like an entire winter.  And then I had dreams about going through a tunnel of bombs flying past me, filling up the sky all around as far as the eye could see.  After that, I decided being sick was no fun and strengthened my resolve to get sick as infrequently as possible.  Nowadays, I just don't have time to be sick.  It's just too much of a pain in the ass.  So I take my vitamins, get plenty of sleep, etc, etc... I think the worst thing for sick people may be having too good of a nurse, like my mom, to take care of you.  It spoils you somehow.

      Congratulations little d!  Your big brain is legendary in this small cow-poke town! I hope we get to see you before you disappear into your books again.  So much for traditions.  I am sad to report that we haven't made tamales this year.  We haven't taken our Christmas family portrait in front of the Christmas tree either.  Oh well,  come si come sa .  Killy is still sick and I am at work.  I'm tired.  Hope everyone is having a great Christmas.

      OK Grandma has been sick.  Killy tells me that I have no empathy for people who are sick.  It's true, I'm sad to say.  Maybe it's because I am never sick.  Or at least, I refuse to be sick.  After listening to MamaLynda coughing all last week and watching her feebly surviving each day, I tried to understand why she was so knocked out by this.  It's really hard for me to imagine being knocked out by something that isn't causing my lungs to swell through my ribcage or my temperature to soar to obscene levels. I'm talking to my sister about illnesses right now.  I don't remember being sick as a little girl, but apparently she does.  She tells me that I would get sick VERY often.  My symptoms would include super high fevers and were always a dramatic event for the family as they would often sit by listening to me ranting feverishly through my turbulent nightmares. Maru tells me that she would sneak by the "isolation" room where I would invariably be placed, and watch my mother praying over me, rubbing my naked body with alcohol and sloshing wet rags all over me to bring down my temperature.  She would yell to my mother that I was going crazy when my fevers would bring me to a new point of deliria.  She remembers looking at me during my feverish highs and wondering if I was asleep or awake as my eyes were half open and I would be screaming and mumbling deliriously. I asked her if I was mean and impatient with her whenever she got sick.  Maru says she never got sick.  But when she did, she said I would complain a lot because I had to do her housework.  Boy, I sure don't like myself in my sister's eyes. But then, Maru reveals to me, that she is the same!  She also recognizes that she has no patience for people who get sick. My brother says this...     Maru hardly got sick.  You got sick more.  When you got sick, you were like a little sickly bird.  You were so skinny.  And your baby hair on your forehead was always wet, like a little newborn bird.  Your eyes never shut all the way when you slept.  And your eye lids were so thin, like a newborn bird.  I remember always feeling scared seeing you sick.  But you were brave.  You always seemed to be in Carol-land instead of sick land.  As weak as you were, you were brave.    Especially that one Christmas Eve.  We were all waiting for midnight to open our gifts after church.  You were so sick.  But you fell asleep.  When midnight came, I ran to get you but all I saw as a sickly bird in a nest of coats and jackets on mom's bed.  I felt bad because you wanted to open the gifts so bad but you were sickly.   Maru, just ignored being sick altogether.  It's like she didn't even know she was sick.    When I get sick, I'm a big baby.  Thing is, I can be sick and I'm fine.  But, occassionally, I really, really get very sick.  When that does happen, I don't ask for things, I just make you feel guilty.  But now, nobody pays attention to me.  And, if anybody does do something for me, I don't feel it's enough.  So, I just deal with it myself.     Ironically, when others get sick, I think they are just making it worse than what it is.  I think they are just doing it for attention.  Except for Adi & Thalia, I just feel so helpless when they are sick and I spoil them.     So all of us have this wierd impatience with people who let their illness be on display, as if advertising for sympathy.  Maru tells me she thinks it's because of my parent's attitude when they were sick.  She says that they would just get up and go.  That there was too much to do to waste time being sick.  So with this in mind, many questions arise... Does this mean that I am sick each time I wake up with a sniffley nose? Does this mean I should stay home for an entire week nursing a little cough?  Hmmm...

      Lots of stuff happening this season.  Finally took Killu to get pics with Santa at the Galleria.  That was fun!  I took last Thursday off as a vacation day because I deserved it and I wanted to spend the day with my little baby boy.  The morning started off slow and easy with breakfast at  urlLink Empire .  We managed to wake Paul Mercado and drag him out into the morning.  Killu ran around all over the place after eating the contents of a giant breakfast taco with chorizo and egg.  He also gobbled down a small sweet risotto.  He munched on cookies while maneuvering between occupied tables and chairs and charmed everyone in the restuarant with his little diaper booty shaking to a fro with each step. Then we took Paul to  urlLink Diedrich's  and left him there to tackle the traffic to the  urlLink Galleria  on our own.  It wasn't too bad, we got there in record time to arrive 20 mins before Santa was to appear.  There was one couple there before us, had been there since 9:30 (ten minutes before we got there) with their little three year old angel boy (everyone compared to my little one seems to be an angel these days).  So we proceeded to wait, wich meant, I got to chase Killu around to keep him from eating the dangerous poinsettias or from getting on the dangerous escalator (MAN was that scary).  He did climb up and down the stairs though, with mom right behind him. Santa arrived at 10:00 AM with his two helpers.  One was a surly large woman, the holiday vest did NOTHING for her.  The other, a young sweet girl with tons of face powder.  Surly was not happy.  Powder explained that the cameras could not be found and that we would possibly have to wait a little while. Killu started violently bucking in my arms screeching to be set free to run.  Angel boy looked on wide eyed with wonder (You were just like that not too long ago, I said to him in my head).  I let Killu run and chased after him shouting my stats to Powder for my order form. As Killu ran around the Mini Santa village, I could see Surly was making little progress, even with two cell phones and one land line all a-ringing like the holidays.  At one point I heard her proclaim, "Yes I will hold and I must tell you that I don't like your attitude...No you don't understand...!!"  Boy, I wouldn't want to be in her shoes, I thought as I ran after Killu who managed to walk into a Crystal store (they advertised on three t.v. screens that your 3-D likeness could be immortalized in a crystal brick - looked kind of morbid like the face of a dead person lying face up in a crystal casket).  I chased him back out into the staircase again, which he proceeded to happily climb. 10:40 AM Checked back with Powder, Surly had run off with a distressed and stressed out looking man "to seek the lost cameras".  It should be 20 minutes or so, says Powder. GREAT! Now we've been out of the house since 7:30 AM, Killu has run around to near exhaustion and nap time is fast approaching.  Change of scenery was needed as I watched him ready to explode into Mr. Hyde.  I took him away to the snack area where I ordered an iced Chai latte with tapioca balls.  The lady who served it spilled some on me.  Great!  Killu screeching for me to pick him up, hmmmm, he's tired.  Saw the clock on the wall, it's 11:00 AM. We went downstairs and found 10 COUPLES in line with beautiful children.  Camera was finally found and was working.  GREAT!  I thought, Now I have to stand in line.  So I took my place at the end of the line behind double strollers bearing twin angelic little girls, dad's burping little newbies on their giant shoulders, moms licking their hands and plastering their little boys cowlicks down.  Killu wanted to get out of my arms again and run up the escalator.  Powder saved me at that moment by spotting me and signaling me to come up ahead.  SURE DID! Killu and I were next, and he was not happy.  Instinctively, he did not want to release my sweater.  When I pried his little fingers away, he pouted, severely, in Santa's arms.  Inwardley, I thanked him for not bucking in Santa's arms (a new little trick he loved to use on me).  He continued to look to the ground with his adorable little pout.  Camera guy yelling and hooting, mama standing a few feet away bouncing and caw-cawing or something, I don't even know what I was doing but it was making everyone else laugh except Killu, who coolly looked aside, steady and sober.  I reached for his face and ran back.  Did this three times before he looked up, obviously unhappy and tortured. SNAP

      Please ignore all of that -- it did print my message about the snow, etc. after all.  Anyhoo, maybe once Anthony and I buy a place you can bring your baby boy up for a visit so he can play in the snow and see the Big Apple -- plus then we'll have more room so you can hopefully have your own bedroom to stay in comfortably when you visit and then you and killy will decide to move to nyc and then todd and diana will move here and so will liz and taggart and amber and adolph and paul and dave and megan and colin & family and we'll all live on the same block in our own beatnik version of an artist/intellectual community where free thinking and creative inspiration are all we care about as we frolic in snow and drink hot chocolate and spend time with good friends and stuff like that ... so how 'bout it?!

      I think my last blog got edited off the blog because it was too controversial -- they sent me an e-mail that the word s h * t was not allowed already -- what did I do now? It's been completely wiped out ... It was right after Carol's xmas blog and right before her cute poodle pic.   -- Posted by Amber Scott to Persephone Risen at 12/8/2003 05:40:22 PM  Powered by Blogger Pro

      I don't know what the blog is doing there is a small entry that Amber tried to post asking about a 'nuther entry but it didn't get done posted for some reason  Amber, I am so jealimonous that you are having a WHITE Christmas as all God-Given Christmases were meant to be while I sit here in my shorts and crop tops sweatin and a'sweatin in the heat of the winter-time.  Makes no sense I tell you!  I often wonder where my little boy will end up when he is 30 years old.  Will he be living in Texas, or will having been raised here cure him of all the blistery evils of it's overgrown sun and frolicking in normal temperate zones where seasons DO exist by golly!  One of my life's goals is to have my baby spend a Christmas in the snow while he is still young to enjoy it without restraint.  Speaking of life's goals Here's a small list. - Eat a lobster on the rocky coasts of Maine while wearing a cable knit sweater and jeans - Go to Hawaii, sleep in a tent and fish for my dinner - Go to Spain and paint a portrait of my husband - Buy a luxury motorcycle and take a road trip across the USA and write all about it - Own a collection of sassy wigs - Learn Portuguese - Open a bed & breakfast in the mountains of central Mexico - Get a university degree of some sort (English or Art or both) - Publish something (already did that, wanna do it again) - Quit my job, be a stay at home mom and be a virtual assistant and give aerobics classes in the evening (sigh...)  Some things to think about.  How bout you?

      We measured 12" of snow on our deck this weekend -- the conifers looked so pretty all outlined in white with the fake red berries I had attached to their limbs poking out here and there -- I especially love the way Central Park looks in the snow -- Fifth Avenue running up alongside with sparse traffic moving very slowly along it and all the usual city sounds are muffled by the snow and all the bare tree branches are covered on top with a layer of snow about 1" thick that just outlines their silhouttes in subtle splendour...  I went Christmas shopping in the blizzard on Saturday -- not content with staying home and roasting my toes by the televised fire -- I went to the Soho Apple store and gawked at all of the prices on Microsoft software that has made Bill Gates too stinking rich for his own darn good -- and then I looked over at Photoshop and nearly fainted at the $600 price tag -- seeing as how I was considering buying my first legal copy until I realized what it is that makes software piracy so attractive ... but then I looked down at the scaled-down version of Photoshop Elements and decided I liked the $100 price tag much better -- the sales guy said it only made a diff. if I plan on editing video or animation, which I don't, so I bought it and then rewarded myself for being so financially savvy by making my way over to Fauchon on Park Avenue for some fancy Parisian chocolates which were , yummmm, so good they make Godiva look like wax chocolate by comparison ... I bought all the girls in our families small boxes of chocolates there and then headed over to Home Depot to buy gift certificates for the guys... I made it home finally covered in snow and laden down with boxes and spent 4 hours scrambling around like a maniac wrapping presents, making pretty little bows in the beginning, and toward the end settling for tissue paper and gift bags as the hours wore on...  Ah, what a relief, Christmas shopping is all done and now I can focus on creating more botanic gardens classes -- they've increased my number of classes from 10 to 20 since the last class was sold out and got really good reviews ... excellent news, now I've got to actually come up with the course materials I promised.  Should keep me very busy this winter ... Ciao bellas, good luck with the shopping and stay warm!

      I just learned that our old friend Lisa Westerbeck will be ringing these bells soon!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!  I hope everyone had a great weekend!  My little family spent the weekend with good friends.  Which is exactly how I would love to spend every weekend if I could.  I must report that my husband has not made it to the running track yet (not even after Thanksgiving weekend).  But he did enjoy his first real guitar lesson which happened this Saturday.    Killito woke me up pretty early on Saturday, made breakfast for everyone who was home and then sat in the living room to watch Finding Nemo with the baby.  Daddy joined us pretty early on so I could have my legs free to cook (baby likes to cling to my legs for undivided attention from me at any given moment).  And then we played around and cleaned our room and did all sorts of miscellaneous things until baby needed his nap.  I took a nap with him for three hours.  I hate taking a nap in the middle of the day.  I usually wake up with a headache.  About 3:00 PM, I woke up with a HUGE headache.  Killy sensed this and suggested we leave the house to do something outside.  I was more than happy to leave the confines of the house so we went to the park.    It was wonderfully chilly out and Killito loved it.  Some kid was having a birthday party at the park and there were all sorts of crazed and manic kids running and screaching and chasing each other with make believe ray guns or swords, girls yelling for the boys to save them (from who???) and boys trying to beat each other with games of strength.  Killito just watched wide eyed and amazed.  Every once in a while interjecting an "OOOhmm!"  or "Dah?!".  We explored the playthings.  He didn't like the slide.  I think it had to do with his big baby shoes curling under his legs as he slid causing him to tumble forward and slide on his face.  So we abandoned that pretty quickly.  He liked pushing the swing and climbing where he could.  Daddy practiced his guitar while baby and I explored and watched the crazed kids.  We left the park after about an hour and went for ice cream.  Baby doesn't like to drink milk from a cup so I worry about how much calcium he gets.  Ice cream is a good way to get it, so we try to take him to get ice cream no more than once a week.  He loves it!  Then we went to Houston to see Paul and hang out for a while.  We got some pizza and went to Adolph's place.  Adolph got home pretty late but Killito stayed awake just so he could see his favorite Godfather.  Then he gladly stayed awake longer to play with him.  We didn't get home until midnight and boy, Killito was tired!!!  My lovely husband let me sleep in on Sunday.  He fed Killito and bathed him and did laundry and was wonderful.  He is such a beautiful man.  But soon we were on the road to Houston to hang out with Adolph, Amber and Paul again.  We stayed their the entire day.  It was nice and Killito got a really good nap in Adolph's freezing room.  Killy, Paul and Adolph played computer games and I relaxed with my little sleeping angel.    Killy and I went back home about 6:00 PM or so with plans to take our family Christmas portrait.    Killy got to go see Ted Leo during the middle of the week last week( I'm sure you have looked at the boy's blog about that).  We are so looking forward to being able to do things together again in the evening.  But naturally, when the weekend comes around, Grandma needs a break and is usually not available for any significant amount of time to allow Killy and I a real date.  I don't even know what a real date is any more.  Not that I'm complaining, I love being with my little baby boy, but I miss my husband too you know.  So Killy gets to go to these shows when they come around and I haven't been able to join him.  So that's what's been going on with me.  How bout you??

      So I went to the Hot Bagel Shop this morning for a handful of poodles.  The pretty black guy with fun dreads calls these tasty treats poodles, and I just got a kick out of it.  Now I want them every morning, plus, it's nice to be flirted with in the morning.  These are mini bagel dogs, three of them are enough to fill you up, yummm, with a hot cup of coffee.  Boy do I love coffee!  This coffee is a Starbuck's blend.  It has just the right amount of bitter and richness that I need first thing in the morning. Anyway, this morning was a little unusual in that everyone in the Hot Bagel Shop was there with their little kiddies.  They must have been about three or four at least and they were CUTE.  I missed my little baby back in Sugarland and I longed to be visiting the Hot Bagel Shop with my little boy this morning.  There was a little blue eyed boy named Sam who wanted to go out into the busy parking lot, "NO SAM, stay with mommy!" the petite, casually, well dressed  and well coiffed woman sweetly cooed.  He reminded me of my little baby boy with his milky white skin and fine silky locks.  I wanted to chew on his cheeks! Killito woke up today with the biggest smile.  I didn't want to come to work, I wanted to stay home with him all day and take him to the park and explore and play all day.  Of course, I got to work late, but I was able to smell my baby and kiss my little boy for a few more minutes. Waiting for my poodles, I watched the mothers and father interacting with their children.  They were vaguely aware of the people around them focusing all their attention and efforts on conversing with the chirpy little kiddies, "Mommy, I LIKE these!"  a little girl in a flowered crocheted sweater gleefully announced.  She knelt on her stool and poked her poodle.  Another little boy, older than the others, hid behind his daddy's legs, eyeing me shyly.  I waved and smiled at him, he shrunk further back and put on his sunglasses to hide. I thought about how nice it would be to live in this area again.  We lived only a few blocks from the Hot Bagel Shop and have walked here on a few Saturday mornings.  Always a nice walk, now a new Chipotle's was being built right around the corner and I love Chipotle.  Plus, this is the type of place where I feel Killy and I belong.  It's only too bad that the property taxes and house prices are so high... It really would be nice though... I took my bag of poodles and my coffee and got back on the road to work, dreaming of a fine house in the Montrose/River Oaks area... Maybe one day...

      That's how you do it. It's never easy, especially when they are in your family.  But the fact is, even if they don't like you, they will be stuck with you forever.  Normally, I separate myself from people who don't like me.  Believe it or not, they exist, and thanks to one person in my family, I remembered this horrible fact.  Unfortunately, because this person is a member of my family, I can't distance myself from them.  Instead, I smile, change the subject, and walk away. Thankfully, I get to go home with my loving husband after the experience.  Everything is better now.  Sorry baby, it's not easy, but it can be handled.  Also, Killy and I agreed that Thanksgiving is with my family, Christmas is with his and New Years is just us, hopefully with friends, but not family.  Maybe you and Ant'ny can make similar arrangements.  LOVE YOU  Have babies NOW

      Yesterday was Barbara Ann's birthday.  She was excited to celebrate her 16th birthday with her family gathered round at the  urlLink Olive Garden .  My little baby was just excited to explore and run around a new place than anything else.  Killy and I really splurged and got BBA a Teen Facial at  urlLink Sensia Studio  for her special gift.  I myself have never had a facial, but I understand they are wonderful. She was very happy with all her gifts (especially with the S&M heels her mom innocently bought for her from the birthday wish list).  Killy and I habitually refuse to indulge some of her more ridiculous requests by never even looking at her wish list.  She has come to expect this from us, thankfully, and seems to genuinely like what we have given her after much thought. I was so scared that dinner would be a chaotic experience and that somehow Killy and I would be stuck paying an extra 30.00 from someone skipping out early or "forgetting" to include gratuity in their share.  But happily, the staff accomodated our needs by separating our bill.  Also, thankfully, we were NOT embarassed by anyone complaining about the service, loudly and frequently while demanding meticulous attention the whole time.  This is such a normal part of these outings that I have learned to make myself scarce most of the time by following Killito around on his little excursions. All in all, BBAs birthday was one of the more tolerable celebrations yet.  Although I still came home exhausted from smiling and not pointing out that gifts from Mexico were brought to every girl in the family but me.  Hmmm, I guess I'm still considered an outsider.  Somehow, this is a great relief to me.

      The holidays can be stressful -- so full of expectations and the pressure to create great memories for years to come.  I even found them stressful sometimes with my own family.  This is my 3rd holiday season with the Fredas and for some reason I got myself worked up into a frenzied ball of nerves this Thanksgiving -- not sure why, perhaps it was because I hadn't done my yoga for the week ... or maybe it was Anthony's fiesty red-headed sister Elizabeth saying my mom's sister's name (Corliss) sounds like a W.A.S.P. name to her, or maybe it was when she said she hates liberals as she stared at me pointedly, but then I have to remind myself that she's half crazy and her particular mix of anti-depressants, marijuana, coffee, and cigarettes all of which she uses habitually and in massive amounts, is probably more to blame for her outbursts than any real feelings of animosity towards me.  "Your sister stresses me out," I tell Anthony when we have a moment alone.  "You act as though you're dealing with a sane person," he tells me, "Remember, you can't take anything she says seriously."  Ah, a strange predicament.  What does one do with a crazy woman?  And the weird thing is, she can be so loveable one moment and so irritating the next -- the day after her weirdness she was hugging me, apologizing, and offering to give me one of her special Shiseido facial massages.  She doesn't even remember half the crazy shit she says anyway -- when I moved here from Texas she said to me in genuine amazement:  "You moved all the way from Texas to America?"  It would be funny if she hadn't been so serious when she said it.  This coming from a 33-year-old woman, I knew I was in trouble.  So back to my original question, what does one do with a crazy woman?  Ignore her?  Laugh at her?  Respond?  What?  I haven't figured it out yet -- at least Thanksgiving is over.  All of the rest of Anthony's family is really great.  I love his mom and dad so much!!  And his other sister, Christine, is also wonderful and our friendship seems to be steadily growing every time we hang out.  So what to do?  I guess I have a few weeks to think it over until the next family get together -- Christmas...

      Hello all! Hope everyone's Turkey Day was just as wonderful as mine!  It started Wednesday afternoon.  I was able to leave the office at noon, which I did enthusiastically.  Naturally, my husband couldn't get out of work until about 1:00 or so.  I spent some time at Walgreens and picked up some Christmas stocking stuffers in the meantime.  When we got home, the plan was to put everything in the car and start driving right away.  This would get us into the valley just after sundown with enough time to relax and hang out before hitting the bed.  Well, Killito had just fallen asleep when we got home at about 1:30.  He woke up at the sound of our voices, and wouldn't go back to sleep unless I nursed him and lay down next to him.  So I did.  And because I was so tired from having stayed up the night before packing everything, I promptly fell asleep with him. Two hours later, I woke up to the sound of drunken shouting out in the living room.  Apparently, Barbara's dad had arrived with his brother in tow to pick up Barbara for her Thanksgiving trip to his house.  In my sleepy haze, I realized that everyone in the house was taking a nap too and that Bob and brother had entered the house through the open garage door.  In any case, I immediately got up and began loading everything in the car, furious with myself for having wasted two precious hours.  I didn't want to be getting in so late.  Killy, who had fallen asleep in the living room, realized the state I was in and hurried to help me.  The baby was still asleep so we could take advantage of this time to load everything without his interruption.   We finally left at 4:30.  The six hour trip was extended by one hour because of the two pit stops we had to give Killito a break.  He was adorable, running through the Stuckies' touching all the shiny crunchy potato chip bags, throwing all the bags of peanuts on the floor and banging on the water and coke refrigerators.  All sorts of women and young girls would approach him and ask to touch him, for fear of inadvertantly leaving evil eye residue on him.  Sure, I'd relent, and Killito would suspiciously eye these strangers as they caressed his head and cheek.  Along the way, we discussed our sleeping arrangements.  Last year, my sister in law was hurt that we decided to stay at a hotel instead of at her house.  She has a cute little house, but on that occasion, my parents were there and they were staying in one room.  But she still felt hurt that we didn't stay with her.  Killy and I decided to avoid the potentially sticky situation and sleep at the house this time thinking we would save money in doing so. We got to my brother's house at 11:00 PM where Lina had just also arrived from shopping all day.  The funny thing was, she didn't get any grocery shopping done.  So Killy had to make a run to the HEB for stuffing and other miscellanies.  We didn't get to bed until around midnight or so and Killito was too excited when seeing his cousins that at first, he fought like a wild cat against going to bed.  But soon, I got him to sleep, and sleep he did.  And he was the only one who slept. Thursday My brother had acquired 4 dogs during the last year.  And these weren't about to be forgotten.  The entire night was a welcome concert in our honor, performed by four mongrel mutts just outside our bedroom window.  Poor Killy, grumbling and mumbling to keep himself sane.  No sleep for us.  Not only that, our family of three shared a full sized bed.  A comfortable arrangement considering our other options, two couches or the floor. I woke up at 5:00 AM made the stuffing with veggie butter and diced veggies (yummm) put the turkey in the oven and went back to bed.  I woke up two hours later mortified because I didn't season the bird. Oh Well... We had dinner at 2:00 PM (Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes made with veggie butter and skim milk, asparagus, cranberry sauce, apple pie) with the idea that we would be visiting Lina's family at about 6:00 PM for more food.  But everyone was too tired to consider that idea.  We stayed home and let Lina visit her cousins and aunt without us. Sleep was welcome but made itself scarce again.  Someone clogged the guest toilet and the kids wouldn't go to bed.  Killy grumbled and mumbled a little louder this night and vowed never to do this again, who cares whose feelings got hurt!  He finally rolled out of bed at about 2:00 AM to try to capture sleep in the living room.  I don't know what was up with those dogs, but they were at it all night long again.  Killy didn't get any sleep at all.  Neither did I for that matter.  But I was just grateful that I could close my eyes and put my feet up for a little while. Friday The next day, we hurried out of there FAST! We had strategically made breakfast plans with Killy's sisters in town.  We met them at a little dive (all decent restaurants in the valley are dives) where we enjoyed YUMMY eggs and beans prepared in various ways.  Killito wanted to play and talk to everyone.  I was mortified that he was pestering people regardles of how cute he looked in his little cable knit sweater and corduroys.  I plucked him out from between two occupied chairs at a family's table when he promptly started to scream bloody murder!  I quickly took him outside to calm down.  But here, it was worse, he found a particularly dangerous stairway that lead to the flat rooftop of a condemned garage building and proceeded to climb it.  I plucked him off the stairs into the safety of my arms where he started to thrash about violently, gargle screaming hysterically (a gargle scream is one that is deep and rumbling and comes out much more pronounced than it could because of the raspy use of the back of the throat).  I was looking mighty cute that day, I must say, wearing my long and lean Gap jeans with stilleto heels trying to calm down a wild cat baby.  I quickly ran back inside the restaurant, thrashing baby in my arms, to Killy so he could help me calm him down.  We left the restaurant right away to the safety of Killy's sister's house.  Baby found another staircase here and proceeded to climb up and down to his little heart's content.  I stayed close on his heels in case I needed to catch a tumbling baby.  Thankfully, I didn't have to, but boy was he tired.  I used a wonderful and HIGH sleigh bed to put him to sleep, for FOUR hours.  He napped like an angel and I rested and read some books that were there. When we woke up, we were hungry again, so we went to TGIF for lunch. Baby had spaghetti and I had a steak, daddy had fish and chips (not the best food for his condition, but he enjoyed it so much, promising with each mouthful to do some exercise when we got back home). Lunch over and done with, we retired to our HOTEL ROOM!!! for much needed peace and quiet.  Here we enjoyed a complimentary cocktail and let Killito walk around the hotel lobby.  Then we went back to our room where I chased Killito around for a long time, then we jumped around on the king sized bed until he was exhausted.  He fell asleep hard! Saturday We woke up late, enjoyed a late complimentary breakfast at the hotel, then drove around to enjoy the beautiful day.  Too bad the mosquitoes were out with a vengeance, otherwise we would have made our way to the park with Killito.  As it was, there were too many pests flying about threatening to pimplify my baby's milky white skin so we stayed in the car while daddy photo'd at every opportunity. Lunch was yummy and bad for the arteries but Killito enjoyed his taco.  We eventually made our way back on the road for the long trip home. We got home seven hours later and after one pit stop.  Luckily Killito fell asleep for the majority of the trip so he didn't get tired of his seat until we were ten minutes from home.  Then he commenced his wail of supreme suffering.  But we got home quickly enough. The second we got home, he was so excited!  He saw his grandma and was even more excited!  There was no way he would be going to sleep anytime soon. He explored the house making sure everything was just where he left it.  Then he ran up and down the hall until he was quite sweating with glee.  I took off all his clothes to cool him down and there he was, quite comfortably running around in his diaper, happy and content to be home. Boy was this ONE CRAZY Thanksgiving... Next year will certainly be different. Next year, we are getting a hotel room!

      I like change, this is why I wasn't really bothered by being laid off.  this and the fact that i found a job so quickly made the transition easier - i know that if i were laid off for months though, enough time to let the real situation sink into my brain and my wallet, i prolly would have had a harder time dealing with it - emotionally BUT since that wasn't the case I was able to shop freely and without restraint i think i found my real persona now again in my wardrobe i forgot how much fun it is to put thought into what i will wear on a daily basis this and the lazy habits of my husband's wardrobe made it too easy to fall into a bad pattern of one pair of pants and scruffy shoes BUT NOW i really need to make sure i look good every day so i need new clothes and my old habits of rotating through new looks like going through a revolving door has come back to me in full force like riding a bicycle i didn't really forget i just got lazy  so now i know how to dress again  and i really enjoy it again

      Hello girls! I hope everyone is doing wonderful. I am sitting here snuggled under layers of clothes & blankets. The Pacific Northwest is bracing for another snowy night. Today was my first day back in class. After all of us classmates wished each other "happy new year" discussing briefly of our exciting holiday adventures and then it happened quite abruptly... reality set in...as we endured a long day of class while snow fell steadily outside. It is 20 degrees right now with 30 mph winds...when I flew in from Texas it was a 50 degree difference! Most likely tomorrows class will be canceled although I'll start reading a chapter or two because next Monday we have our first test...I can't believe the fast pace of this semester-hit the ground running huh? I already miss everyone so much especially my honey. Take care of yourselves, lil' d

      The Chavez family had a wonderful New Year!  We celebrated with our good friends and kept it mellow.  Adolph and Amber are such wonderful hosts having all sorts of good stuffs for the Chavezes and Lil d and Todd to enjoy!  The Chavez boys were relieved and excited to be at the Trudeau residence on this happy occasion where the Fourth got to run around and be wild and crazy like every little boy should be and where the Third got to run around and be wild and crazy like my beautiful husband should be! New Years Eve started out pretty tiring, for me anyway.  I didnt want to go to work, it just didnt make sense to have to go in to work when all I wanted to do was enjoy the great sales that were taking place all over the land.  I did take advantage of the 75% reduction of all things clothing at TJMaxx where I got a great deal on a great skirt!  Then headed home to herd together the baby and all his trinkets and what not! MAN Talk about an excuse for buying great bags and purses,  so much to lug about with a toddler in tow! So Killito and I made it to Adolphs without fanfare.  My lover/husband was waiting for his little family inside where we immediately unloaded all my bags.  We took Killito out for a short excursion, then Adolph and Amber showed up, dressed and tressed and looking mighty spiffy. We puttered about the kitchen and took turns shooing Killito into safer quarters until dinner was ready. Then I nursed the baby and he happily fell asleep which made it time to glamour up for a quick girly outing.  Amber Lil d and I jumped out into the NYEve night and hunted and prowled for a good place to enjoy some of the last of 2003 in a glass.  We found a relatively nice place, not too crazy with nutty party-goers and not too empty.  It was also clean and classy.  Not bad!  I had a really dirrrty vodka martini chock full of 10 olives (mmmm) Amber had a  urlLink Greyhound , and Lil d a beer to chug happily on.  We chatted and giggled and then it was time to meet the boys. We got home with 10 minutes to spare.  Just enough time to reassure my wide-awake child that the world was still in one piece and to pop open a bottle of champagne.  Cheers!  Laughs!  Kisses! And Hugs all around! Happy New Year!  Then, Lil d and Todd made a graceful departure, Amber and Adolph retired to the bedroom, the Chavez family hunkered down in the living room and we all snoozed the morning away.  Happy new year..

      I would definitely, absolutely, and without question go -- but then again, this is coming from a person who went to Europe for 6 weeks with a backpack and only $1,000 to pay for travel, food, and a room and who ended up running out of money and had to work at a hostel for 5 days to get back home ... some people hate the stress of the unexpected, so it's better to know yourself and know your threshold for the unknown ... it will definitely be a culture shock -- being around that many people who don't speak english and who come from a totally different culture will be a major challenge ... but you only live once and I'm sure you will come back from that trip with stories you will be telling to others for the rest of your life ...

      Personally, if I were in your situation, I would go for it.  I wouldn't worry so much about the money because as we all know, it appears out of nowhere when it's absolutely necessary.  I would love the adventure.  But that's me. Liz's questions are right on the ball.  Is there a reason they picked you for China, maybe they see some potential for you over there?  Or is it like you indicated, purely luck of the draw? You have every opportunity to visit China later on in your life.  You should go with your instincts and if they tell you that this is not the right time, then don't.  Don't feel pressured to do something you aren't comfortable doing.  One the one hand, you won't see China right away, on the other, you will get to visit someplace else that you might not otherwise be able to so easily.  Plus, it might cost less.

      I'm always up for an adventure, my first instinct is to GO!! But you sound so apprehensive about it, and it's going to be stressful where ever you go. What are the reasons they chose China? Will there be an English speaking clinic? Is it for public health? Do you want to spend your money on that or do you want to save it for a different adventure?  I say, maybe they know what they're doing, and maybe they think you would learn a lot. Think about it as a learning experience-where and how will you learn the most about being a good PA? If you don't go, will you wish you had or will you look back and be relieved. Or just think, they could send you to Delaware! Sounds like a difficult decision.Are there any others going over-seas?

      hello ladies,  As some of you may know, in less than 7 weeks I'll be starting my clinical rotations! I am so excited and really scared at the same time. Each of us in our class were given "wish lists" in addition to trying to set up rotations in our home states(background: we have to have rotations in several states). So far, I am applying for MD Anderson for oncology, and have a cardiology rotation setup in Houston otherwise thats it for my Texas tour as it stands right now. Its really a mystery as to where "they" ultimately decide to send me. Its frustrating in a sense, because they say we have all these options & opportunities yet when we choose places we're interested in they send us elsewhere. I am trying to go with the flow. The motto is: everything floats on water and therefore are schedules can change at anytime. Well, to get to the point "they" want to send me to China for a month!    I think the traveling & medical experience would be so cool...but I'm nervous that I'm not cut out for this adventure. Since my Africa trip I'm a little more apprehensive of traveling to distant places alone where I know nothing of the area etc. I do not regret my Africa trip, it was an experience of a lifetime but I do wonder if things didn't turn out the way they did if I'd still think so. I guess its all about risks and one's outlook on life?   So, I just got off the phone with my sweetie and he suggests I think it over. I always thought it be cool if we went together on our own someday. The other aspect is money. In addition to our regular semester tuition, we also have to pay all of our own expenses and living throughout this coming year. Mucho dinero! What are your opinions? I can protest if I don't want to go but I only have a short time frame to respond & then its out of my hands.  Go. Not go. Maybe later. Ask again?   Goodnight from the NW

      an excerpt of an email from Maru,  I've been reading your personophone (?) and wanted you to tell Amber congrat's and I THINK she should go drug free of course.   Amber First of all, I am heartbroken that I had to do a C-Section with Adolfo Fidel, it was necessary and in the end for the best (if you don't remember, his little foot was wrapped by his umbilical cord making it difficult for him to drop and affecting the blood and oxygen flow to his little body endangering his life).  But I was really psyched to do it all natural and was pumped about all the sensation associated.  You will hear from many women about how painful it is.  But the reality is the only thing that makes it painful is when you don't know what is happening with your body. Killy and I took  urlLink Bradley Method  classes.  This is a husband based coaching natural birth method.  This means, the husband is the main coach during your pregnancy and birth.  And it is natural.  We found this to be a bonding experience and Killy felt like an integral part in the whole process because he learned about everything my body was going through.  The most important thing I learned was how to identify the signs of the processes my body was going through.  This is important because the signs allowed me to prepare for what was taking place.  And I had the choice and the strength to relax through the most difficult times.     I'm referring to the contractions, these seem to be the most painful of the whole birth process because the muscles start freaking out and generally, the mommy doesn't know what to do.  The Bradley method teaches you to focus on what is taking place inside of your body and the purpose for its happening.  Once you understand how these work together, the experience becomes a more respectful, fundamental one rather than one full of fear and apprehension and therefore, a painful one.  Also, your husband, your coach and loving partner, also knows what is happening to you and can provide the important comfort that you need during those moments. Maru failed to express the beauty of the experience and the chance to feel something that drugs will never let you.  The sensation of relief and bliss that is the highest of any climactic love session you've had when you feel your little baby washing into the huge world, awake and alert. The dangers of taking drugs as mentioned before, is that too many may be given and the child is born groggy and out of it.  I personally think this is not fair to the little baby.   I did not choose an epidural.  Since I had no choice about the emergency C-Section, I was still able to choose the type of drug I would be given.  So I had a spinal-block anesthesia.  That was one dose of stuff instead of having a needle stuck into my spine for the duration of the C-Section.  Plus, they only numbed me from the waist down.  I was wide awake the whole time they tugged and pulled on my muscles and tissue while opening the door for my little boy. He came out screaming and dripping my blood. Whatever choice you make, don't let fear of pain be a deciding factor.  Pain is nonsense. I really believe that we are built the way we are to tolerate all sorts of stresses that we must undergo.  I guess it's easy for me to say this since I've broken every bone in my body at least once (slight exaggeration).  I decided that I didn't want drugs for all the reasons I mentioned and others that this blog doesn't have room for.  But the choice is yours and no one will judge you for it.  Regardless, the most important thing is that in the end, you will have a beautiful baby to love and nurture for a long, long time.  urlLink Interesting Link

      Good morning girls! I hope everyone is doing wonderful out there. I apologize for not writting in sooner, my schedule is slowly lifting. hooray!  Amber I am so happy for you! You will be a beautiful mother. I wish only the very best for you and Anthony's new bundle of joy on the way! Yay. So how's it going? Can you feel the baby moving? (quickening)-it maybe too early. Do you guys know whether its a boy or a girl or are ya'll waiting to be surprised? Well I too, just finished OB/GYN and as you know, Carolina, Liz or I will be able to offer our advice and support along the way.   So here's my bit about coffee-we learned its OK to drink a 100ml or less of coffee (caffeinated) per day during pregnancy. This is the equivalent of 1 cup a day. It is completely your choice. How far along are you? How have you been feeling? Well to answer your question about whether to use drugs or not, in my mind anyway, it depends on the condition of the baby and the pregnancy. I'd get all the information first, let your doctor know your "ideal" and trust both yours and your doctors judgement. I agree its a hard decision. I know it will all work out wonderful!  Enjoy a lazy Sunday and take care everyone, diana

      OK, you are right about the protein and calcium. If you don't eat enough calcium, your body will take it from the bones and that's not good. Protein, eat a little more than you usually would at each meal, that way you don't feel totally full and bloated after a meal, and eat small frequent meals. But Carolina would tell you the same thing! Lifting? Really try not to lift too much-a scientific explanation: you know when you have to burp or (pooh) and you "push," That "maneuver" causes negative pressure in your insides-which causes gas and other stuff to come out, but you don't really want to do that right now, because it can affect your womb too, maybe. Anyways, the same effect occurs when you lift heavy things too.   Yoga is great! Try prenatal yoga though, so they know what you should and shouldn't do. I personally, (and Carolina probably would too) would encourage you to TRY going pain free. When you have anaesthesia, you are more tired and groggy afterward and it's more difficult to recover from. Also, your baby may be groggy too and may not want that first, important colostrum.  BUT, most people get the epidural and are FINE, and they do great. And it's not bad to do so, but wouldn't it be great to just try and see what your body can really do? Like a marathon, it's not fun, nor easy, but the sense of accomplishment and empowerment is priceless.  These are opinions, but the yoga should help get everything "opened" up and ready for labor. When is the due date? September right? You are going to be great-listen to your doc. and don't hesitate to ask him/her alot of questions-don't worry about taking up his/her time, that's what they are there for, or ask the beautiful, wonderful nurse at your clinic!  Hope this helps! But Carol is of course the expert, you should have seen all her books!

      Hmmm ... I think up new questions every day -- luckily, Anthony's aunt has a phD in Obstetrics & Gyn, so I bug her pretty regularly and she's great about answering ... Off, the top of my head, Liz,  -What sort of nutrition advice do you have?  I keep reading little snippets here and there, like don't drink decaff coffee, don't eat too many apricots, stay away from ginseng, avoid too much vitamin A, etc -- but I'm worried that I may not know about every culinary misshap  -- is there a definitive list that I should go by? Also, are there certain types of foods that you should eat according to stages of embryonic development? (i.e. calcium for bones in the 1st trimester, protein, etc)  -I have had some spotting and my doc checked it out but said it's nothing to worry about unless it becomes more severe -- the ER said to avoid heavy lifting -- what exactly do they mean by that?  Should I not be doing as much twisting, etc in yoga? Should I not lift anything over 10 lbs?  I have a very physical job, so lifting things in the 10-20 lb range is pretty hard to avoid...  What do you think?? Any other insight?  Oh, I'm going with an MD -- do you think it's better to go with drugs or without? I don't know if I can handle that much pain!!!

      I helped a 19 year old birth a baby on Tuesday. She was great. She had an epidural, but nobody tried to tell her that she could do it without. People look at you like you're crazy if you want to go drug free?! We have a theory-men want to take away the mystery of child birth, and control it with C-sections and epidurals,  and inductions. It might be whack, but think about it. Something so natural and special, being treated like an everyday operation. And scheduled so that Doc. can have dinner with the fam. Just a theory.  I'm so happy for you Amber. I'm obsessed with pregnancy (I'm studying it this semester in nursing school). So if you have any questions, I can find the answer in one of my text books! Midwife or MD?

      I walked into the shabby temp agency offices at 32nd and Madison and met Joe, a fast talking brown haired man with hard eyes. He said he could definitely get me a job as an admin doing power point presentations for an investment firm making more money and better benefits.  I said where do I sign and by the way I'm 2 months pregnant.  He quickly changed his tune at the news.  Well, I can't help you, then. Who's going to want to hire you knowing you're going to go on maternity leave in several months?  He sounded almost angry with me.  I left that small little man in his shabby little office and didn't look back, resting my hand on my belly on the ride home, knowing that I can endure anything, any rejection, any hardship so long as I have my baby -- any job seems so measly by comparison ... and so I find myself not as upset as I thought I would be -- having a baby inside of me sort of puts the world around me into perspective.  And taking care of plants isn't so bad -- at least here I'm surrounded by people who have grown to love and care for me over the past 3 years .. I know they will be happy for me when I tell them about my little hidden virgo treasure.. and maybe this is the sort of place I belong in right now, rather than a strange new environment with a boss that would just resent me in his small-minded way ... for what?? creating life?? how ridiculous and sad.

      You are too cute ...  I can see Meagan being happy at a Montessori school.  As for me, I'm thinking about a change of career -- of course, I'll still teach my botanic gardens classes, which I adore ... but my every day job has gotten too physically demanding -- I can't be schlepping plants and bags of soil and watering cans for the rest of my life ...  I want something more civilized ... I want to make Power Point presentations!!! I LOVE Power Point!!! I want to schedule meetings, use my brain, organize things -- yes, I'm actually considering life as an admin asst -- lord knows, there's enough jobs for admins in nyc -- maybe i can find some creative place where people feel engaged by their careers, respected by their boss and co-workers, and generally content about life ...  that's what i have in mind, anyway, so I'm sending out the 'ol resume to a few temp agencies -- carol, do you mind if i put you down as a reference?  what's the best number to reach you at??  Muchas gracias, bella!!  oh, yeah, Killy sent me an e-mail that you might be vacationing in Deleware this summer... what's the deal-io??

      of course the right thing to do is to tell them that you are pregnant you can't avoid that  you can also play the blank card that is i didn't know i was prego??? what a surprise!  then, if the company thinks you were lying they could let you go using any excuse they want (and in Texas, using no excuse at all)  but if you tell them up front they'll know what they are dealing with and they will make a decision with all the facts present and you will know whether or not this company is understanding about that natural state of things or if they have unrealistic expectations of a young, modern and happening mom-chick  SO  both of you will be happy in the long run  believe it or not there are companies that will hire you in the divine state  and those that do not you can ask yourself do i really want to work for them???  also maybe you can look into another direction  if i wasn't so scared of chill'un treating them like bugs and such (tadeo???) then i would have done the same thing meagan is doing  she was hired in her divine state at a montessori school  now isn't that a dream!!!???

      i ate everything didn't deny myself a thing i tipped the scale at 200 on my 8th month triumphantly gaining over 60 pounds during my pregnancy i am now happily a size 8 again only thing left to show for it are some silky silvery tiger stripes up and down my little belly and my beautiful angelic baby the pride of my life  amber here are some ugly truths your butt is going to get huge your hips are going to get wide your belly is going to get big and depending on your mom you may or may not get stretch marks you will gain lots of weight your nose is going to get wide (if it's a boy) and your feet are going to swell your boobs will become someone else's literally and will never be the same again  but don't sweat it enjoy it eat everything you want but just keep in mind don't eat as if you're eating for two because unless you really need it and one hamburger isn't enough and the only thing that will satisfy you is a 24 oz steak with potatoes for the most part one serving is good enough  anyway after the baby comes into the world you have plenty of time to get back to where you were before and you can look just as hot and sexy then as you look now so don't worry about it  and i know you you won't have a problem putting in all the yummy nutritious things you need drink lots of milk baby will take away as much calcium from you as he/she can eat fruit every day even if it's only an apple and stay away from whatever makes you nauseous  speaking of nauseous i didn't have any symptoms except when i took my prenatals first thing in the morning i think it's the iron in it??? i don't know something made me nauseous about it so i switched i started taking them at night just before bed and everything was just fine  do you think it could be something like that for you???

      I love the way Anthony is already putting his head on my belly and talking to "Junior" or "Junioretta" as he invariably refers to the baby -- he's going to be such an excellent father!!  I haven't told anyone at work yet but my belly is rapidly expanding and I probably don't have more than another month before it starts to become noticeable.  Ethical question:  If going for a job interview somewhere, do I tell the prospective employer that I'm pregnant to establish an upfront, honest communication -- or do I keep quiet on the grounds that it's personal, it's illegal to discriminate, and the fear that they might not hire me because of it, in spite of what the law says??  Carol, tell me about your pregnancy cravings!!  Any advice on what to eat, etc??  I'm afraid of getting too fat -- but I also, of course, want to be as healthy as possible and not deny the baby or myself any nourishment ... Favorite foods: pickles (cliche, I know), chocolate chip cookies, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, egg mcmuffins, curly french fries, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches ... ummmm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!!  Ew, I felt nauseous today for the first time when I woke up this morning :(

      Well, I just got back from my first pre-natal yoga class ... what????? yes, it's true, ladies --- anthony and I are expecting -- looks like it might be a virgo, carol -- mid-to late-September is the date and I'm 7 weeks prego right now with just the slightest bump for a tummy and finding myself with sudden cravings for chocolate chip cookies and mint chocolate chip ice cream, but luckily none of the nausea or tiredness, at least not yet -- we go in for our first sonogram in a couple of weeks and I find myself worrying, will it be healthy -- should I wait to tell anyone until I see it's little heart beating and breathe with a sigh of relief when I see all 10 fingers and toes .. but it's driving me crazy not to tell anyone -- and so you girls are the first to know outside of the immediate family -- pretty crazy, huh?!  We're so happy!!

      So just so everybody knows, Meagan is doing quite well in her pregnancy.  I hope to see her next weekend while she is in Austin.  Jennifer Barnet is also excited and happy about her state of prego-ness.  Lisa W. is still planning a wedding, don't know the exact date for this yet, last time we spoke she was talking about throwing in the towel and eloping.  I'll get you the scoop when I have more.  Maru is well moved into her new little house, Killy and I spent Saturday helping her out, watching Ezra while unpacking and yard cleaning was worked on.  Killy is currently walking through with the inspector of the Casita that we are looking at.  Hmmm.... More updates later

      Carol, the more plants you can grow from seed, the easier it'll be on the 'ol pocketbook -- just imagine, a package of 10-30 seeds for $1.99, rather than spending $4.99 per plant ... hmmm... that's a savings of $50-150 -- that should make Killy very happy with his smart, beatiful, and, oh yes, very frugal wife!!  Books -- well, my specialty is container gardening since that's what's most in demand in NYC ... but there is a great book on Southern Gardening that was written by a friend of mine -- hang on, let me check on Amazon for the name of it ...

      For some reason or another, I have developed a reputation of being a prankster here in my office group of 15.  I don't know where these ideas come from, but a result of this is that I am now the target of innovative acts.  On Monday of this week, I stayed home with Killito to care for him as he got over a weekend stomach virus.  When I came back to the office on Tuesday, I couldn't find my stapler.  It has great emotional value to me because my ex-boss gave it to me when I left my last job.  Plus, it matches the desk he gave my husband. SO Here I am Tuesday morning asking the entire group at the top of my voice over the cubicle walls if they had my stapler.  No one responded.  As it turned out, I had missplaced it , then I found it later that day. SO Wednesday was Admin Asst day.  My boss took me to lunch with the other admins and we had a blast.  When I got back to the office, I found an email in my inbox from one called,  Stanley Stapler .  I didn't open the email right away because I thought it could be a virus.  So I ignored it for a while.  About an hour later, I couldn't find my stapler.  So I looked all over the floor thinking I missplaced it again and then it occured to me to check the evil email. I did. And this is what I found  -----Original Message----- From: Stanley Stapler [mailto:mrstanleystapler@hotmail.com]  Sent: Wednesday, March 17, 2004 2:23 PM To: Chavez, Carolina Subject: Lunch   How was your lunch today??

      I can't wait to have a little house to make my own with an herb garden and lots of little plants around the yard. I need some recommendations for books on how to plant and when and where and what to do. And some info on composting. Any suggestions?  I really want to dream and make plans.  Killy gets really stressed out about my planning and my dreaming because all he hears is the ching of the cash register as we spend our future money.  Hmmm :-( Makes it difficult to stay excited and happy about the possibilities.  BUT  I am going to dream anyway. And I am dreaming of plants and shrubberies and little speckled trees with flecks of flowers and dappled sunshine on mossy rocks and maybe later on in my old age, a koi pond.....  dreams....  :-)

      I'm itching to get back into the garden again -- I spent last weekend mixing in manure compost, bone meal, and blood meal to enrich the nutrients in my soil -- this weekend I'll start mixing in pine bark mini-chips to improve aeration and green sand for trace minerals ... and then do a final soil test to make sure everything is in balance.  The bulbs are just starting to come up -- little ruby crocuses, red striped and green flame tulips, white daffodils, fragrant hyacinth, delicate muscari, "Grow, grow, GROW," I want to sing out to them .. and April 1 seems so far away ... that's the first date to start planting cool season crops like lettuce and onions and garlic and snapdragons up here ... then another long wait until May 1 to plant nearly all the other seeds -- peas, zucchini, chamomile, dill, parsley, alyssum, lobelia -- and then 15 more days to wait for the real heat lovers, and on May 15 AT LAST -- I can plant the rest -- tomatoes, eggpplant, peppers, sunflowers, love-lies-bleeding -- Yippppeeee!!!!  I'm so excited I can't stand it!!!!

      Diana, I know that if you do end up going, it will be fun and exciting and very fulfilling!  Congratulations for making that decision.  Meanwhile, Killito is doing very well at school.  He is making new friends and plays all day long.  He loves trying different ice cream flavors and is always exploring how things work.  He especially loves gears and wheels and stuff like that.  He is 18 months now and I can't believe that just one year ago, we were celebrating his half birthday.  I hope that we can get ourselves to Austin to celebrate his half birthday this year (March 28).  Also, Killy and I are planning a REAL vacation this year.  We hope to be making our way to visit with the Gholsons in the East Coast.  WHAT   A real vacation!  I still can't believe it!  Another adventure of the day was yesterday's rain.  The wind and the rain was so strong, that you could see the building sway if you looked out the window.  Also, if you were riding in the elevator, it would screech and groan as it bumped its way up and down.  If you were so inclined to be in the bathroom during a particularly strong wind, you could see the water moving in the toilets to and fro. Hmmmmm. Pretty scary stuff.

      Thanks everyone for the wonderful advice! I have until March 19th to make my final decision. I am so excited because tonight I am going to talk with the student who went last year. I can't wait to hear what he has to say. To answer Liz's questions: I originally showed some interest in going to China last year and therefore our clinical coordinator chose me to be the student from our class to go. I would work at the Hong Qioa Clinic in Shanghai for two weeks. I'd stay at a local hotel and take taxi's to work each day. This is an internal medicine rotation and most of the staff does speak English. I would be working directly with Dr. Khoo. I actually met him last year at a mtg. about SARS. He seems like a great person and extremely knowledgable. Then I'd go approx. 180 miles north to the country to Wenzou Medical College and work there for the other two weeks before heading back to Shanghai and eventually back home. At the medical school, I'd stay in a dorm with other students from around the world. An English interpretor may be there. I agree with you girls that it is a wonderful opportunity. Thanks for sharing your stories too! I am still in the process of finding out the details...although as it stands now.....I am definitely going!

      Carol, I must say you look great in the photo Adolph posted on the boy's blog from Easter -- what a sexy mama -- when did you get so thin??!!  I think all the weight you lost has flown across the country and is now resting on my hips and belly as my precious pumpkin grows larger by the day -- I don't think I'll ever fit into my size 2 Banana Republic cords again!! And forget the size 0 skirts ... this is so weird to be getting fat ... I know, I know .. it's natural and healthy and all that ... but it's just so disconcerting to look in the mirror sometimes!!  Get ready you girls who haven't had a baby yet -- it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers ... I'm really looking forward to being out on the beach in a bikini this summer ... Awww, look at the cute fat lady waddle ;>

      i love talking about s e x i love sex when you're prego so much FULLER for both this is when the woman's body is so ready for it too so much more pleasurable you need to explain to antn'y that it is wonderful for the baby it will massage him and shoot him full of good hormones scientifical reason is your body is so PLUMPED, ENGORGED, INFLAMED and ripe for loving it's true, that's why women who suffer from nasal congestion feel it even more while pregnant, as the hormones of pregnancy can cause swelling of the nasal passages and increased mucus production. This is a good thing because thos same hormones cause swelling and plumping in other areas that can be felt in the throes of loving  tell antn'y to get over it and get on your hands and knees girl you can't hurt the baby.  unless of course your doctor tells you otherwise  I think these days six weeks might be cutting it it pretty close if you don't stay active to the end.  I mean, walk, walk and walk, do yoga and more yoga, and stay active.  Then it will be easier to get on with things. I was out and about 2 weeks after the Adolfo Fidel was born.  We took him out to eat at Empire.  But I did get very tired very quickly.  Maybe it was the c-section...  I think you may find it harder to leave your little baby behind than you think.

      I think Robbins' new book, Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates, is more readable than Skinny Legs and All -- his style has evolved and is more subtle yet still provocative without having to cram it down your throat so much ... I still love his old works too for their sheer imaginative force, but, much like Salman Rushdie, it can be a bit much for many people.  Hmmmm, no Robbins is not a virgo, he's on the Cancer/Leo cusp -- maybe not so much like you, after all, Carol ...  So let's talk about pregnant sex -- is it just me or do you have a lot less of it when you're prego??  I'm not sure what it is -- could be the belly interfering with the comfort level of the favorite position ... or the fact that Anthony is anxious about hurting the baby, or the fact that when he looks at me now he sees "mother of my child," instead of "hot chick" -- or the fact that we are closer than ever emotionally but both our sex-crazed hormones seem to have subsided substantially, maybe it's the fact that our evolutionary directive has been met for the time being ...  Also, another question for you girls:  how long is the recovery period after birth??  I signed up to teach classes at the botanic gardens 6 weeks after the baby arrives (just one Saturday here and there for a few hours, not back to work full-time) -- that's enough re-coup time, right??  Were you ready to get out of the house on your own by then, Carol?  I imagine I'll be feeling pretty stir-crazy by then, considering I rarely sit still for a minute in my free time and usually work 7 days a week even now ...  What do you think?

      I've read Tom Robbins, all the while thinking of Tim Robbins, because he is so tall, with such a baby face, and so intense in the roles he's had, especially Jacob's Ladder ('member that?) crazy psycho freaky movie with the shaking face-less heads and the devil tails... I read Still Life with Woodpecker or something like that I started to read Skinny legs and all and quickly found myself near an overdose about halfway through it.  I turned instead to re-reading my favorite book of all time, Vladimir Nabokov's  urlLink Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle  After reading this morsel when I was but a young nymphet of 15, I played with the possibility of naming my first boy, Van Veen.  This thought eventually evolved into the ultra-cool name, Seven.  Then I married the love of my life and had the most perfect little baby known to me of all time.  His name is the sound of love, and it is not Van Veen or Seven or even Gunther.  I like Nabokov, although  urlLink many people don't because he's "too wordy" .  HEY  So this woman was shopping at the Banana after having had a baby! I need to get on the treadmill again!

      So I'm working at Banana Republic, ringing people up ... and there is this lady, and we keep eyeing eachother-"How do I know her?" - So finally she asks outloud, "How do I know you?" We can't figure it out, then I say, "well, I'm also a nursing student" then Pow! We figure it out. I helped deliver her baby!!! Isn't that so bizarre? I'm selling her a jacket and delivering her children! Now that's service.

      What a romantic story, Diana!!  I'm amazed that Todd is able to keep a secret for so many days without bursting -- that's impressive.  So opposite of either Anthony or I -- we can't even wait until Christmas to open our presents -- we usually end up opening them a week early!!  Skinny Legs and All is SUPERB!!  You will have so much fun reading that, Liz -- I love how imaginative and quirky and raucous and lewd Tom Robbins is ... he awakens my mind and sets my own imagination on fire ...  Carol, you've read Robbins, right??? If not, you must stop everything this very moment and go out and buy one of his books.  You were meant to read Tom Robbins -- you are kindred souls in your loveable prose-like mad ramblings and your ingenious spark of spontaneous living.  Maybe he's a virgo, too..

      For a whole 3 weeks I get to sleep in, do lots of Yoga, work and earn money, and maybe even get a tan!  I'm so happy for you Diana- I love love-I can't wait until your wedding, 18 months goes real fast...right Carolina!  So babies are on the way! We are predicting another Virgo for the Chavez fam-but they don't know it yet.  I had a dream that my friend had a baby boy, do I have dream powers?  I am reading Skinny Legs and All-and since Amber is a Tom Robbins fan, I thought I'd share. He is wierd, but widly expressive.  How's your pregnancy? I love hearing about all the changes. Labor and Delivery made me want to get pregnant, then pediatrics reminded me about the outcome, not bad, just not for me yet.  I loved the Red Tent, if anyone needs a good femme book, it's the one.  Talk soon, Carol, when is the house warming party???!?

      Hello ladies...Geez I apologize for not submitting the details sooner! I am not sure I can beat Carolina's account of events but I'll try. Two weeks ago Todd flew up here to Oregon during my school break. We had a wonderful two days in Portland, picnicking in Washington park and walking all over downtown. Then we drove up to Vancouver BC for five days and four lovely nights. We stayed at the Wall Sheraton downtown, the tallest building in the city. We explored the city's museums, parks, bridges, seabuses, beaches, coffee houses...everything. We walked everywhere. Each day greeted us with cloudless blue skies and warm weather. Ahhh....we spent the days talking about each others lives, our future and our dreams. On our last day in  Vancouver Todd suggested we go to the beach to walk around and take pictures of the beautiful skyline. We ended up at Kitsilano beach, walking in the sand and admiring the view. I started picking up seashells because thats what I do and spotted an oyster shell. I thought of how cool it would be to find a pearl inside, so I tried to open the shell and couldn't. I sat down on this huge rock, so big you had to climb to the top, it was some geological marker Todd and I decided. As I sat there on the rock planning my strategy on how to open the shell, Todd tried using the end of one shell to open the oyster but it was stubborn. So Todd shuffled around in his backpack and then climbed his way onto the rock and sat beside me. At that moment Todd looked at me and presents this small black velvet box and says "why don't you open this instead". At that moment time stopped, my heart began to race and I squeeked with excitement as I showered my love with hugges & kisses. He then said we'll.....are you gonna open it? We laughed and as I opened the box I saw the most beautiful sparkling diamond ring. He then got down on one knee and said "Diana, will you marry me" I was so happy and so surprised...yes, yes, yes I said. I will never forget that moment, I felt like a little girl, all day I was on cloud nine. Todd and I hugged & kissed some more and took pictures to document our incredibly romantic engagement on Mayday 2004. My heart flutters every time I think of Todd and that beautiful day! Afterwards we called our loved ones to share the good news. On the rest of our adventure we entertained ideas of wedding details and are planning on a Texas wedding in October 2005. October 23rd is when we met at Shipley five years ago...I am so lucky! As far as wedding details go, I promise to let everyone know as we figure them out. I'd love ideas and advice. Oh, and to address to baby question, the plan is not until after the wedding :) It's on the horizon!  I hope everyone is doing wonderful, take care diana

      So, as I gathered, from detailed interviews with Diana, this is how it happened.  Diana: I woke up and had to unclog the toilet, it seems Todd had problems with his stomache from the night before, I made him his favorite, Chicken Cacciatorri. Me: OK... D: So there he was struggling to get out of bed and in a puking fit, he kicked me, in the kidney, so I fell down writhing in pain. M: Really...??? D: Then the doorbell rang, it was room service, and neither of us could get up to answer the door. M: And then...??? D: So the cleaning crew came in, of course they didn't see us right away because we were in the bedroom section, but they could hear us struggling (in our pain). M: Oh yeah??? D: So this big fat Russian man comes in, holding the broom over his head like a weapon and sees me lying on the floor in tears, Todd is leaning menacingly, I guess, over me from the edge of the bed wearing only a towel... M: MENACINGLY??? D: I guess, because then the Russian man proceeds to wack Todd with the broom... M: NO!!!! D: Yes!  And then Todd loses it on the carpet... M: NO!!! D: Yes, all over the Russian man's shoes! M: OH MY GOODNESS!!! D: Well, apparently, the hotel was training new cleaning people because there was a whole crew behind him in the anteroom, all excitedly speaking Russian among themselves. M: AND THEN WHAT!!! D: Well then, I get up from the floor and try to stop the big Russian man from hitting on my poor Toddy. M: Oh my... D: Meanwhile, one of the cleaning people had called security.. M: OH MY!!! D: Apparently, they thought we were recording some kind of dirty film because they saw Todd's cameras in the corner of the room... M: Dirty film???? D: Yeah, and so Big Fat Russian Man motions for one of his people to get me away... M: NO!!! D: So this really nice and scared looking young lady rushes to me and pulls me out of the room... M: And then!!! D: I don't know exactly what happened next, but between the cops showing up... M: NO!!! D: And all the cleaning people shreiking excitedly... M: And then!!! D: And me being held down out in the hall shouting for Todd... M: And then!!! D: All I could hear was loud shouting in Russian coming from our room... M: NO!!! D: And every now and then, I could hear Todd's helpless heaving... M: And then!!! D: Well, eventually, Big Fat Russian man comes out, smiling, propping Todd up, who is weak with having puked all morning, comes to me and hugs me. M: WHAT!!! D: The nice lady who was watching over me translates his Russian.. M: ... D: He is congratulating me for making my man strong by giving him poorly cooked chicken. M: ?... D: Before we get married... M: !?... D: To make him strong enough to stomache the difficulties of being a married man... M: !?????... D: This is when I notice that Todd is holding out this little box to me with a weak and beautiful smile... M: And...??? D: And I opened the box... M: AND!!!??? D: And in front of all these strangers, I jumped and hugged Todd and screeched, "YES!" M: YES!!!??? D: YES!!!  Diana, Please share with us whatever I left out.

         No Amber, your words are not lost and you didn't say anything wrong.  I love you and am so excited for what you and Anthony are going through!  I hope and dream that maybe you can make your way to TX to show off your package to family and friends because I really wish I could be a part of this miracle.  You are right in suggesting that we are all busy.  I know I have been very much so with the new house and the new job.  But we are all doing fine as you can see with Killito's healthy countenance.  We all love you!

      Mother and Father are in town! YAY! They are so cute.  My father arrived sporting a new haircut.  It makes him look like a Kewpie doll.    We are all signed up to take part in the Houston Rise & Shine walk.  Proceeds to benefit The Rise School of Houston for children with Down Syndrome and other developmental disabilities.  It should be nice.  Maru is bringing her wagon so both kiddies can ride together while we all walk the walk. It's free for us as my company is a sponsor and will pay for each walker's way.    Killy will stay home to wait for the internet guy to show up and make the connection we so desperately want!  Aftewards, we will head back to the "Kickin' K Ranch" for some good grub ( huevos rancheros y frijoles ) then maybe to the park for the kiddies.  SO  My new home number is 713 NUT SULT  Amber Freda  What are your numbers again? Please share and email me at  CarolinaDivina@Gmail.com

      It's always odd being the last post on the blog followed by a long silence ... because you can't help wonder at first, was it something I said ... but gradually the paranoia fades as you realize that all the girls are just really busy ... keeping up with their guys, their jobs, etc ... who has time to write?  or read, for that matter?  maybe I'm speaking to no one at all ... my words simply disappearing into the internet ether never to be read at all because you all tuned out long ago ... so I offer this one shout which I hope penetrates telepathically to you all:   Don't work too hard, girls!!  Or, in the inestimably profound words of Cindi Lauper, 'Cause girls, they wanna have fun!! Yeah, girls just wanna have fun!! That's all they really waaaaaa-aaa-aaaant, some fun ... when the working day is done, oh, girls they want to have fun!!

      Here he is, little Antonio is growing by the minute -- exponentially it sometimes feels like:   urlLink     Happy Birthday, Cancerians!!  I'm glad to hear your party was a success, Carol -- you are the consummate hostess with the mostest, after all.  As for moving to Texas, well, I have to admit -- I'm in love with the city.  I don't want to leave New York!! It's so creatively alive and infinitely complex and interesting.  They'll have to take me kicking and screaming -- especially now that my freelance business is taking off.  The phone's been ringing off the hook for garden design and installation projects -- I just got a huge $10K job, the biggest one yet -- my client is having me design her terrace completely, including furniture, a fountain, gorgeous Japanese Maples, trellises for ivies to climb on all sides -- it's truly a garden paradise. It looks like all the hard work is finally starting to pay off -- Anthony was right when he told me to stick with what I love and eventually everything will start to come together...  just in time for 'lil Antonio!! xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

      Diana, Happy belated birthday!  It sounds like you had a wonderful time.  I can't wait to see you and give you a big fat hug!  Diana, I am so happy for you.  Your dreams are coming true.  One day, you are dreaming about how things will be, then you blink, and they are.  Congratulations on everything so far.  So much more is yet to come.  So much joy and serene bliss...  Amber, How is your belly?  If you click on Killy's picture on the side-bar, you will be taken to the amazing image uploader thingy!  I don't know how I did it, don't ask me to figure it out, I am so proud of myself for doing it all by myself, but I did it!  I added a button! YAY YAYAYYAYYAYAYYAYAYYYAYYYYYY  Such small things make me so happy.  Speaking of small things, This weekend was a BLAST!  Killy, Killito and I hosted our first official party.  Our HouseWarming party!  It was a success!  Not only did most people show up, we had very little leftovers.  Our neighbors were there; Killy's family was present with his mom and two sisters; my family was present with my sister; some of my co-workers were there; Amber, and John, Tag and Liz and their dog, Wes and Claire and even Killy's step-father was there!  It was great!  Everyone had a great time and we were very tired afterwards.  Killito did pretty well though.  He didn't take his afternoon nap at the usual time because of all the excitement, but he did enjoy a 2 hour nap later, enough to rev him up for more action play with his cousin Ezra.  I was very happy because my house finally felt like a home.  Where people can gather to eat, laugh and have a good time.  We missed everyone who wasn't able to make it though...  I'll post pics later.  LOVE

      hello everyone...i hope ya'll are having a wonderful weekend.   Liz-Feliz Cumpleanos! i meant to send birthday wishes yesterday...so did ya have a nice b-day? i know i did! my preceptor gave me the day off...and even though i have a cold i went to my favorite cozzy coffee shop to read stiff, then went downtown portland to see the first showing of fahrenheit 9/11 which was quite eventful-it was so refreshing to be with down to earth, like-minded individuals...i met wonderful people in line, sharing stories and exchanging movie recommendations...it was my first fandango experience-anyway mid way through the sold-out show, the movie abruptly stopped, lights came on, sirens alarmed and instructed us all to "evacuate immediately" we all groaned in unison, at first in disbelief, "is this part of the show?" others shouting..."its the republicans attempt to keep us from watching the movie"...so with reluctance we filed out down the stairs, some recording the alarms on their cameras...it was ridiculous! we exited the theater only to re-enter immediately and with more determination we went right back to our seats, exactly the same arrangement not missing a beat...no one was detered. i don't want to reveal anything for those of you who have not yet experienced the movie...but i highly recommend it! i talked with todd, mi mama y papa, best friend, todd's mama and had a wonderful birthday dinner with my two aunts, we ate at some plush place overlooking the city on "the hill", it was beautiful, 3-4 hrs later, i came home, snuggled in bed and watched sex in the city. so how's school going? i've been meaning to ask you...especially since amber & i's discussion, do you guys use "live models"? i would love to hear your comments!  amber-i am really enjoying this discussion. i do at times notice things about every day people that i encounter and wonder...hum, that looks like hypothyroidism, cushing's syndrome, hydrocephalic baby etc. i do, i can't deny that. i am trained to recongnize these things but i can go beyond this and see "people" as they are. i don't let the previous experience of seeing someone insides taint my view of them as a whole. some of my classmates have said, "i can't see them the same since i saw...blah bla..." so it affects people differently. i think it is necessary to see both subjective & objective. to a certain extent you need distance to perform a job well without interference from emotions...much like dissecting a cadaver. it is hard to do but much less difficult than if it were on someone you know. at the same time you respect the cadaver as a corpse that once harbored a living, breathing person and use that experience to hone the skills of properly separating and connecting yourself with the people you encounter concerning life & death issues. geez, i hope i am not sounding cold, anatomy lab was not an easy thing & sometimes just acknowledging this difficulty and dealing with the emotions is necessary and important. i am honored & grateful to have had the experience to learn about them. what i love about medicine is the interaction with people. not every body is the same. even though PAPs may become routine the individual brings variety to medicine therefore each case is unique. its a balance, constantly switching from focusing on the problem objectively to addressing the whole person. it is the art & the science of medicine that is equally important. there are people you encounter that invariably you develop a connection with and keeping this in balance is a life long process. balance is the key, when medicine becomes too impersonal, procedures so routine that human beings are neglected or when professionals become so emotionally involved that impairs their clinical judgement and burnout...you cease to to do good for patients and yourself. on another topic, i can't wait to see your picture. how is everything going with you? i think that is so wonderful to treat yourselves to a good cleaning...ah, i can't wait for todd & i to have a place of our own to clean.  carolina-i hope you're having a lovely, house warming parte! guess what, i've been salsa dancing with some girls from school on the weekends and next week we start taking lessons! i can't wait...we'll have to go dancing in houston sometime. i hope work is going well...and look forward to seeing you soon!   take care everyone...lil'd

      Carol,  Have you ever paid someone else to clean your house for you?  We did it for the first time yesterday to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary -- what a dream that was to come home from work to a sparkling apartment!  This woman was amazing -- she even cleaned the grout between the tiles in our kitchen -- we've decided this is something we must treat ourselves to at least once a year to really get those itsy-bitsy details that make such a difference but no one ever really has time for ...  I have a belly shot I can post to the blog, but i don't know how -- whatever happened to the amazing uploader thingey?

      Amber, thanks for bringing some semblance of intellect to this blog.  The only time I have time to think about what I want to post is during the time that I have while at work, which is no time because I'm constantly doing something or wasting my time with fast searches and brief browsings.  No time at home time because when I am not playing with my baby and loving him, I am cooking or cleaning the kitchen or folding the laundry or eyeballing the laundry while cooking in the kitchen, the entire time with my little boy fighting against the wall of my legs whimpering for me to pick him up because he remembers better days or if my son is busy making mischief elsewhere, my husband is fighting against the wall of my back for my attention because he remembers better days while I am washing dishes or folding laundry... I read a book once I actually bought and read Maus SO GOOD I am only grateful that we don't own a T.V. otherwise i'd be wasting valuable time trying to watch idiocy... I painted my kitchen green Am planning my hosuewarming party for this Sunday... I listened to NPR this morning and heard  urlLink this article about green roofs  which reminded me of you...  Diana, I'm thinking pink and dark red, almost brown...  Liz, What's up!  I started walking/running and doing Yoga, thanks to Claire (formerly known as Belinda) and am loving my little house!  Miss you all!  Amber, What's new with the belly?  Have you had your 24 oz steak well done yet?  How much do you weigh?  Any ultra-sounds and what-not?  Are you still looking for a house?  There's one for sale right down the street from where Killy and I live and love.  The rain is beautiful through our windows...

      Diana,  That's interesting the way you kind of switch gears in your mind to cross between clinical and subjective experience, the left and right hemispheres.  I've always been a tad squeamish -- can't stand to watch horror films, fainted at the sight of my own bloody nose as a teen-ager, went through a brief if vivid phobia of needles, etc.  I figured it must be a matter of tuning out the vividness of life that made the difference between my gut reactions and a more level-headed approach -- but also wondered if any of it was learned or innate ...  Also, I always wondered if people who are exposed to lots of medical ailments start having a radar for that sort of thing at dinner parties and social interactions -- i.e. I'm talking politely to Mrs. Jones at the hors d'oeuvres table but really I can tell by the pink rash on her neck that she's got acute gangliata of the colon -- okay, I'm making stuff up here -- but do things like that start to pop up in the mind?? -- i.e. I'm nodding politely as though I were listening to what you're saying but really I'm just picturing what a mess your colon must look like right about now??!  hehehe -- I think my imagination would go wild exposed to that much detailed information about the human body on a daily basis -- sometimes I do have dreams about my plants -- I've dreamt that a variety of white scale insect that attacks the stems of kentia palms was all over my body and it itched sooooo bad -- and I've dreamt about parasitic weeds suffocating my plants, growing faster than I can pull them out ...  I guess what I'm also saying is that I don't see how anything like hemorroid removal or pap smears can ever become so routine that you stop associating the personality of the patient with the procedure and become completely clinical -- and then I wonder if you start to care more or less for people after being so intimately familiar with their bodies, or is that something you turn on and off as well?

      hello gals,  today the sun is shining, breezy blue skies..ahh life is good. its about damn time too..away with the june gloom-spring is here(compared to Texas seasons)! with the beautiful weather its harder to focus on readings but thats ok. well i hope ya'll are all doing wonderful.  carolina, i love your tweet tee...its so cute! i hope you have a wonderful house warming party...i wish i could be there to help celebrate. so lil'kilito is going through the terrible 2's eh? hopefully this will pass quickly...todd told me the other night that killy papa sent a video chat of kilito-how cool. so how's life at work?  amber, i hope you are enjoying pregnancy life...how's it going? i agree with carolina-send pictures! lately, i've been having some sexy, intense dreams in which todd & i are expecting a baby-crazy huh?   well to address your question about the human animal,which is a very good question-i'll try to answer to the best of my abilities. i feel in order to work in medicine one has to be able to view the human body more like a composition of parts & pieces that make up an entire working system...separating mind and body in (western medicine) connecting them in (eastern medicine)...each part necessary for the whole to be complete. you have to compartmentalize and address the body objectively...reviewing every system and its functioning. in many ways, i think medicine has a tendency to view humans in a more animalistic nature too.  for me, i have always been intrigued with medicine and drawn to the blood and guts so to speak, although the "nerves of steal" isn't always a innate thing...it takes practice to be able to remove yourself from the picture, remaining at a distance to perform your job yet still being empathetic and present in each situation. i'm having a hard time explaining this concept. i have yet to experience the surgery & trauma-its on the horizon.  not to de-humanize things but some surgeons have been equated to mechanics if this helps any. therefore on a professional level, i can see it all, and look at the body objectively...addressing intimate concerns such as doing pelvic exams, male exams, rectal, breast, stomach, and so on, balancing the animalistic-primitive workings of the body and addressing its relation to the individual.   on a personal level, how i view my love, friends, family and myself is very different...depending on the situation...i most certainly can remove myself from this professional thought process and enjoy the sensuality, mystery of the human body etc. although i can flip back into the objective mode very easily-does this make sense? is this different from your views of the human body?-now i'm curious.  i hope you all have an enjoyable weekend-take care, lil'd

      Yes, it's true, I am finally going to have my housewarming party! It will start on Saturday, June 26, 2004 and run through Sunday June 27, 2004. Please come those of you who can!  Amber, When are you going to send us pics of yo belly!  Family updates...  Adolfo knows how to use no. It's cute because he says it, pensively and decisively, not brattily.  He is also going through some SEVERE terrible twos.  BOY.  Especially with me.  It's probably because he knows he is breaking my heart when he cries when I tell him NO.  It's not usual for me to say no to him, so when I do, he has a fit.  Killy is studying something called Cheetah (???) on the computer whenever he gets a break from being the world's best dad and husband.  We have fallen into somewhat of a regular schedule and things are still being unboxed and put away...  I have 6 shirts in my  urlLink Pixeltees store .

      OK So I found the  urlLink Blythe doll  that looks like me. Except she has green eyes in this picture Which is really not an issue because I too have multicolored eyes...   Fashion Diva and Ultra-Punk girl. She was born two years after me, but then I've always been a late bloomer.  Claire (formerly known as Belinda) stopped by the house last night, whilst I was out doing my daily jog.  I came home and there she was propped against my kitchen counter sipping a Coronita, Killy was making tostadas...  We got to talking about her little head and futuristic ultra-modern homes (i just stuck my whole arm down the front of my dress to scratch my belly and nobody saw 8-0 !!)  I woke up this morning with this idea in my head and remembered a couple of articles I saw back when I was looking for a house to buy...  Here's one treasure,  urlLink Dome Houses .

      So, Diana, what's it like getting so intimately familiar with so many different bodies?  Do you look at people differently now after seeing so much exposed flesh?  Do people seem more or less animal-like to you now?  It must affect you on some level of perception -- I'm curious to know how??  Were you ever squeamish about blood and guts, or are you one of those people who was just born with nerves of steel?

      Hello all, I hope everyone is doing wonderful!  I'm so happy that my love is recovering so well and that he is surrounded by encouraging and loving friends! My heart fell on the floor Wednesday evening when Todd called to tell me about his amazing collapsible lung...I've never felt so helpless. Thankfully he reassured me of his condition, it was as if he had already anticipated my questioning prior to his call, he remained calm and collected, telling me the details. I'm so proud of him for seeking care, I only wished I could have been there. He's super hero Todd...of course he'd do fine...I on the other hand tried not to sound anxious while simultaneously flipping through numerous medical books on treatment & prognosis. I couldn't help thinking...will this serve as a turning point and give him the purpose to quit smoking? All the while as important a factor smoking is, my concern was to address the immediate dangers, and so I made sure he wasn't having any shortness of breathing or difficulty breathing. I wanted to give him warning signs but not be alarming, yet I was sure he got all this at the ER...what else could I do. Timing is a delicate thing...the last thing he needed was me (of all people-given my history) saying something like, ya know you really outta quit smoking. I know he knows, it was apparent in the sighs...and pauses over the phone. All night I tossed and turned, the next day stricken with nausea, I saw patients which gratefully kept me focused on all things not Todd. I was elated to hear that he will be OK! I was sad to hear that this could happen again...something I already expected from my readings but remained hopeful for better news. I know the surgical procedure is an option but an expensive one, medical insurance would be a necessity. Soon, soon I say...Todd will have the best healthcare insurance as long as I can help it! I was secretly hoping that Todd would say, oh yeah, the doc's advise that I quit as well. After inquiring, the surgeon let that one slip by. I quickly said, it's documented that you decrease you're odds of this happening again by at least 50% if you quit now. He'd already had it covered, his arm that is with the nicoderm patch, ahhh I sigh in relief, I am so proud of him! Again, I just want to send my appreciation to all of you for supporting him...he has the best friends ever!  As for me, I'm already well into my family medicine rotation, in Beaverton, OR. I am absolutely loving every moment! I was extremely nervous the first week, trying to resist being thrown into seeing complicated patients on my own. I am learning at an amazing speed, time flies at clinic, I come home enter patients and procedures in the computer each night...look up everything I had seen that day, do write-ups and read some more...sleep a little and wake up and repeat. Each patient uniquely different accompained with new challenges...never a dull moment even for the simple ear ache or muscle strain. Already, I've done numerous PAPs, well child exams, male exams, and regularly see diabetes, HTN, asthma, thyroid disorders, mental disorders...it goes on & on, the crazy thing is the more you learn the more you realize what you don't know and thus you strive to learn more. Yesterday I had a 15 hr + day, working at the clinic during the day and the free clinic at night. Each Thursday, in Hillsboro, doctors, nurses, lab techs, interpreters & students come to volunteer free healthcare. It is the most rewarding experience. It's difficult to see the masses of people in need but their appreciation is priceless. Next, I am scheduled for Houston, TX in cardiology I can't wait especially since I'll be closer to my love! I'll try to post more often and share some experiences if you gals are interested.   One last thing, I just got done reading this incredible book called, Complications, a surgeon's notes on an imperfect science by Atul Gawande. I highly recommend it! He is a surgical resident in the Boston area, graduated from Harvard, and is a staff writer on medicine and science for The New Yorker, national book award finalist, national best-seller, need I go on. This is by far one of my favorites! Take care, Diana

      don't know what's become of them i think they are still being born at least here in my home where my family spends teetery weekends together trying to find the groove  seems to me that they're around hiding in the corner  with the tumbling pile of shoes or maybe curling under the bed with the dustballs and the legos  maybe they haven't been unpacked yet  in any case morning is a slow move from perfect to real where real is a moon-faced oval dreaming on a purr

      Carol, I will help you design your garden.  First, what is your soil like?  Dig some up and wet it slightly and then see if you can roll it into a ball -- if so, you have clay soil -- if it falls apart very fast you have sand -- ideal soil is loam, which is somewhere in between clay and sand.  This will tell me whether or not you need to amend your soil to make it nutritious and healthy for plants before you start planting anything.  Second, what plants exist already?  This will tell me something about what does well in your garden so that I can find other plants that like the same things.  Third, I need to see photos of every area that you want to work on -- start with one or two so you don't get overwhelmed -- and then I have to know how many hours of sun or dappled sun they get per day.  Fourth, I need you and Killy to come up with an irrigation plan for those areas.  It doesn't make sense to start planting things that don't have a watering system to keep them alive.  I suggest you do a combination of soaker hoses and sprinklers -- this will be the most economical approach and you can get these things at any home improvement store.  You should also look to see where your outdoor water sources are located -- are they near the beds or far away?  We can plan more drought-tolerant plants for far away.  Once I have all of this, I can draw a simple design plan for you to take to a nursery and start buying things.  I can also tell you which plants can be grown from seed.  E-mail me photos of plants you think might be weeds and I'll tell you if they are or not.  Don't tell Killy I'm helping you -- let him be awed by your sudden green thumb gardening skills, instead!!

       plants  OK So my little family was coming home from being out in the world.  As we drove up to my little house, I was filled with an overwhelming sense of pride and a desire to have the prettiest house on the block.  I stepped out of the car into the sun dappled front lawn and thought how easy it would be to tweak my little garden and avoid a growth of weeds.  My eye locked on a particularly suspicious looking stalk, heavy with leaves.  It was big and healthy and seemed to threaten the well-being of the flowering bush next to it.  I gleefully yanked on greenery announcing to Killy that I would be weeding the garden today. My mistake was apparent instantly when I noticed the beautiful bulbs at the base of what I thought was a weed. Killy scolded me as I tried to put the plant back.  He made me promise never to touch the garden again.  I almost cried as he harrumphed to the garden shed to gather the tools needed for the job.  I felt foolish and useless.  And I still worry because I think weeds are growing in the garden, but I don't know if they are or not...   cleaning  Amber, Killy thought your suggestion about getting a cleaning service once in a while was a great one.  I never thought about it, honestly.  It seems like such a luxury.  Maybe I should feel like I deserve more luxuries.  Most of my co-workers have cleaning ladies once a week.  But they, as CPAs also make much more than I do... If we decide to do this, I will tell you about the experience.   dreaming  I dreamt that Maru made me late to a wonderful new job with Adolph's dad.  I slapped her because I completely missed the appointment and lost the opportunity at the same time.  She offered to give me a ride back home but I was too angry, and surprisingly enough, she understood.  She felt badly enough and responsible for my loss that she gave me money for a cab.  She gave me 22.00.  Two tens and two ones.  I watched her drive off with her husband.  Completely heartbroken and distraught about not being able to do this wonderful job with Adolph's dad, I didn't immediately leave.  I sat at a picnic table of an outdoor cafe instead and had some soup.  I watched as one old lady told another little old lady that her rent was going up.  The little old lady pleaded to not let this happen as she couldn't afford any more for rent.  The land-old-lady announced that the rent would go up regardless of how many years she had been there.  Land-old-lady suggested that the little old lady should take the government subsidy instead and move out so that the apartment could be rented to someone else.  The little old lady had no choice but to take the check and start packing her stuff.  She didn't have much, it all fit in one bag.  Then she came and sat down at the same table I was at and started talking to some of her friends who happened to be there.  They all commiserated with the little old lady and I just kind of watched.  I got up to pay for my soup, but when I came back, my money, which was on the table, was gone.  Then I noticed the little old lady's bag was slightly open and from it's depth, two tens and two ones peeked out.  I thought about the job I just lost and plucked my money right out of that bag.   toenails  I usually clip my baby's toenails while he sleeps.  Lately, he's become more resistant to this even in his slumber.  He kicks his legs and curls his toes while I struggle to not cut his delicate little skin.  This morning, he woke up while I was in the process.  So I showed him what I was doing, explaining everything along the way.  "See?  This is your foot, this is your toe, this is your toenail.  I take the nailclippers and...CLIP."  He was fascinated enough to let me take to clips without kicking. Maybe tonight, he'll let me finish.   plus  I've developed my mother's sigh.

      Carol,  Here are some shade loving plants for hot climates -- I'd like to help you more, but I need more information about your garden first.  Next time you have a free weekend, take a look at the sun/shade patterns in your yard and the compass directions (south tends to be sunniest/warmest, north tends to be darkest/coolest)  Caladiums - look for beautiful white, pink, and red leaf striations.  These look like small, colorful elephant ears Elephant Ears - large, tropical leaves in upright arrow-shaped forms or downward facing, relaxed forms Begonias - good flowering plants for shade, come in lots of different colors -- yellow, orange, red, white -- look for more beautiful angel-wing, rex, and tuberous begonias, rather than the regular garden variety Ferns - Really brighten up a shady area with their lacy foliage -- look for the silver-leaf Japanese Painted Fern or the red-in-autumn foliage of the Autumn Fern Variegated Ginger - look for the yellow and green striped leaf -- very striking foliage Black Alocasia - looks like a black-leaved, silver-veined elephant ear -- beautiful, unusual, highly desirable Creeping Jenny - look for the golden or green-leaf versions -- nice creeping groundover, more interesting than the usuals Pygmy Date Palm - A graceful, slow-growing palm that tolerates shade -- you can buy them around 1-2' tall, and they eventually will get as big as 10-15' Ivy - old stand-by groundcover for shade.  White and gold variegated varieties are more interesting. Vinca - used mostly as a groundcover, but does also get a star-shaped blue flower -- I like the variegated form best Mondo Grass - grassy mounding grouncover also called monkey grass -- look for the dwarf black mondo for something diffferent -- a similar effect is liriope & Silver Dragon Liriope has very nice white and green striped foliage Shade Coleus - look for purple-leaf coleus varieties as these tolerate more shade.  Very colorful foliage -- one of your best bets for interesting leaf color and texture in the shade Wandering Jew - purple-leaf groundcover grows vigorously and has a pretty little lavender bloom Tradescantia - also called spiderworts, these are grassy looking perennials that get very charming little pink or purple blooms  Hope this helps!

      It's official.  My little boy is weaned off the breast.  It was difficult, more for me than for him.  But I decided it was time when he started asking for it by name, "Nu-nu-nu-nurse?", hopefully, pleadingly... He will be two years old in August.  It breaks my heart and fills my soul with warmth and love when I think about the time that has passed.  And I finally understand a mother's heart and cry when I think of the losses many have suffered.    For the first time in my life, I've experienced panic attacks.  I'm too sensible to have such things happen to me, I naively thought.  But then, I am at work and wonder who is with my child...what is he doing...how is he eating...  But those are the only questions I allow myself.  Other questions lurk in the back of my mind.  But those are unspeakable, those are what makes my heart leap into my throat, my breathe to quicken, my blood to race.  I spoke to a friend about this phenomenon.  Her eyes crinkled into a warm smile and her calm voice bouyed with eleven years of child rearing in it's tone, reassured me.  "That's called a panic-attack.  You just have to not think about it.  It'll drive you crazy."  For the first time in my life, I've also experienced heaven.  At least this is the only way I can describe his little body's warmth against mine, the feel of his little hand in mine, the smell of his apple sweet breath, the soft powdery scent of the crown of his head, his radiant smile.  I am ridiculously proud.  My Child can say his name!  I shout this to the highest heavens because mere mortals cannot understand this miracle!  My son can RUN!  I beam foolishly as his strong chunky legs pump furiously in joyous motion.  My little boy can FEED HIMSELF!  I let the marinara sauce paint his cheeks as he greedily shoves spaghetti into his beautiful mouth, getting most of it on his shirt instead.  I want the world for him.  I want him to never suffer needlessly.  I want him to know love all his life.  I want to watch him grow.

      Okay, I will try to be as specific as possible, but keep in mind that I have no idea what plants are available to you locally and it may be hit or miss.  You can only do a cactus garden if you have at least 4 hours of direct sun.  Anything less than that will make you a bona fide plant murderer.  When you say you have shade, what do you mean?  Do you get any direct sun whatsoever, even if it's just for 1 hour?  If so, how many hours and is it in the morning or the afternoon?  If you don't get direct sun, do you get dappled sun through the trees?  If so, for how long?  For the sunny veggie garden, how many hours of sun does that get?  Morning or afternoon?  What is the average minimum annual temp that you go down to in Houston?  30-35 degrees?  I don't remember.  The more details you can give, the more educated my recommendations will be, and the greater the likelihood will be that your plants will actually survive.  Also, planting anything July-September is probably a very bad idea due to extreme heat stress involved with new plants.  Anything you plant in the middle of summer will have to be watered every day to establish a strong root system.  Best times for planting:  spring and fall.

      Carol is trying to ask for maru (after a lot of wine) how to plant a cactus gardens?  I have a very shaded back yard and would like to start a cactus garden in the corner.  In other words do I have to buy special dirt and have it raised?  Our dirt is very dry and clay like.  Do I need special dirt or something else to facilitate a cactus garden?  What do you suggest?  I also have a lot of shade in the front yard (four trees).  What plants  do you suggest for a variety of color? Please tell me specific plants, not names of books to research.  I don't have the time.  I would really appreciate your knowledge on this. I hope you can help me.    I hope you have your baby naturally.  I had a great experience and I believe it was the pre-natal yoga that helped me. I had Ezra within 2 1/2 hrs with no drugs, and it was the best experience of my life and I'm not afraid of doing it again.  I mention this because I think it's an option to really look in to.  PLUS, you probably already know, there are post-natal yoga classes out there for you to take advatnage of.  I was interested in starting a vegetable garden in the one sunny spot I have.  I understand that you need to have to have it elevated and it needs good drainage.  What do you suggest for good drainage?    OK  sounds good...and I don't have a flat roof.

        Dave Asks: What is this?    That is a M-2 .50 caliber machine gun with a blank firing attachment mounted on a M113 family personnel carrier, probably rolling around Ft. Irwin, CA.      The M-2 is blow-back operated: it's mechanism depends on the backwards force of the bullet being ejected from the barrel. Since a blank is just a small powder charge, it doesn't have the same force as the full powder charge and bullet, so the blank firing attachment covers up enough of the barrel muzzle for the blank to produce the force to operate the mechanism. It is separate from the barrel because the barrel of the M-2 moves backward (hence, "blow-back operated"). It also includes a metal piece that goes into the feed tray of the weapon, which prevents real bullets from entering the weapon, a real disaster if you have that BFA mounted.     The operation of the M-2 is similar to how pistols operate, only on a much larger scale. What is remarkable about the M-2 is that is is a highly accurate weapon, despite it's barrel moving around quite a bit. I think it is probably the largest blow-back operated automatic weapon in existence or in common usage. Some other large weapons, such as the main gun of tanks or howitzers, also use blow-back force. However, the mechanism of cannon typically is confined to shock absorption and breech opening (and the breech ejects the spent cartridge or base case). They are not truly automatic in that people load the next round in them, or are automatic on an electro-mechanical basis, in that the blow-back force does not also load the round, but a mechanical contraption powered in some other way loads the next round.     For the vehicle ID, I was confused at first by the soldier with the binoculars on the left. He is actually sitting on top of the vehicle and the metal in front of him is the characteristic upwards facing engine exhaust of the 113. The vented circular object in the center foreground is the horn.     To the far right of the picture frame, you will notice two upright and curved at the top tubes of silver metal. This is part of the cage of the "whoopie light," a signal light mounted to vehicles while using MILES gear, a militarized version of laser tag. On the M-2, just above the base of the barrel, you can kind of see the laser, which is a little metal box mounted on top of the weapon, that shoots each time it feels the shock of a blank being fired.     Since this is commonly used at large scale war games at the National Training Center (NTC) at Ft. Irwin, and the mountains in the background seem characteristic of the mountains and valleys Mojave desert there, I figured that this was taken at the NTC. The soldier to the right is wearing a CVC helmet, (Combat Vehicle Crewman helmet) and the soldier to the left is wearing a standard kevlar helmet.     In my former unit they could be mortar guys or mechanics. I think they are mechanics because they look a little bit messy (sleeves rolled up, on the guy to the left, neither he nor the track commander to the right is wearing a BDU top, despite obviously in an  action pose for a picture. The binoculars look to be of an older variety, which opens up the possibility that they are cavalry scouts or mechanized infantry, since it would be before the Bradley Fighting Vehicle was fielded. An additional possibility is that they are national guard, in which the messiness and dumb looking action pose would fit as well.

        but todd, ryan and i had a blast until the power in the office blew up.   yeah, i was a little worried, but everything turned out just fine. it had to happen as soon as we had all of our ducks in a row, didn't it.   i spent some time this weekend putting together a little book of images i made at the  urlLink japanese gardens  in portland, which i was able to print thanks to taggart. next time i see him, he gets a little book. lucky guy.    and there's a moral to this post :: give me something i want and i will be nice to you. other wise, take your chances.

       carol,  i hear that dairy products can really help your body to produce more muccus. eat lots of cheese and butter. if you do i'm sure your face will swell full of that thick yellow stuff.  i used to hock it up and use it for glue. it's better than wheat paste!  gouda really makes that stuff thick and chunky. you should also try and put alot of butter on everything you eat! it tastes great on steak!  killy,  i wish we could have spent more time playing this weekend. you were like a little brown rambo durring our game we played. it was fun to watch you run amok, killing everything in sight. remember when the enemy hand grenade blew your face off? that was so cool. i got to see the whole thing. awsome. really.  d.

       i almost forgot: this weekend was soooo cool! i had a real blast. i felt almost 'normal' for a bit. it was too bad that tag thinks his wife is more important than gaming and dave thinks having an affair with mr. green is a top priority; but todd, ryan and i had a blast until the power in the office blew up. it was extra-super-scary too considering how much of mr. green we had taken in. the "oh-shit" factor was off the charts!  i reall can't remember exactly what we played, but i do remember that paul's computer isn't very ghost recon friendly. and here i thought that playing on paul's ultra fast super computer was going to really speed things up. well, so much for that...  the breakfast the next morning (afternoon) hit the spot: a monster breakfast burrito with xtra cheese and salsa. oh man, i could eat one of those things every weekend for breakfast and NEVER get tired of 'em.  i did manage to get in a co-op mission  game in with dave at carl's place. that was fun; although, i wish i could have stayed longer. i abandoned them to visit holly before i headed back to houston.  holly is as busy/frustrated/awesome as she's ever been. she's flying all over the place with tosca these days, living out of cool hotels and partying when she's not assisting.  got back into houston around 10:30 or so. took my time coming back home. i imagined what it would be like to live around everyone again. i really miss having everyone around.

       both my wife and my son came back from chicago with a fever, which gives me a fantastic opportunity to take a few hours (if not the day) off of work to take adolfo iv to the dr.  he's actually fine now (knock on wood) and should sleep soundly tonight. being that this is his first fever, the doc wants to check him out anyway. more than likely it wasn't even the weather in chicago, but the fact that he's teething that gave him the fever. maybe. carol's isn't really a bug either, but a normal allergic reaction to cats.  normally, i'm the first (and only) one in the household to get sick. I can't remember the last time that carol has been sick.  their trip to chicago was fun, so i hear. adolfo iv did fine on the plane (both ways) and everyone around him fell in love with him. his aunts, uncles, and cousins in chicago had a blast with him; although, i hear that he's afraid of his cousin thalia.

       well, luckily this day has lasted longer than normal. adolfo iv is taking his first plane ride with mommy tomorrow morning to chicago. there, he'll be staying at the Courtyard Marriot in downtown Chicago. I'm going to miss them. this will be the frist time i'm away from both of them for real. i feel kinda weird, but i'm trying to ignore it.   urlLink      a weekend (or at least a REALLY late night) of gaming should be great therapy. Speaking of gaming, I finished the third mission of the Desert Siege campaign. I played it for five days before i made any headway on it. The next mission is the 'protect the convoy mission. I tried it a couple of times tonight and got eaten up. Well, there's always this weekend.  Well, it seems that Ryan, Todd and I are going to duke it out with Taggart and Dave and  anyone  else they can persuade to take their side. I wonder if chuck would throw his hat in the ring?

       sounds good! i'll be there this weekend. i'll prolly show up around 9:30 or 10-ish. um, i'm kinda still fishing for places to stay. should i stay at dave's? should i stay with carl/tag? or should i (since it seems that we may end up gaming there) just end up at todd's?      also, if we game over on todd's side of town, does that mean taht i WON'T have to bring the imac? does paul's computer constitute an 'xtra' computer? that would be nice, but i don't have any problems with bringing my computer along for the ride.  anyway, wherever we end up i'm sure it'll be a good time.

They didn't have any stock of the  urlLink Nostromo N30 Game Mouse  (you got to love a mouse touted as having a "rugged, aggressive feel") when I bought the game pad, so I will make due with my  urlLink optical PocketMouse Pro .  Once the N50  urlLink comes in , I am going to work on my  urlLink Ghost Recon  skilz. I wonder if it will work w/ Illustrator/Photoshop/Fireworks.

       oh you're so right todd! this IS so much better. but the background is still oragne...yuck.  so last night i dreamt that i was murdered. i was hit on the back of the head in a dark room and then stabbed in the back multiple times in the back. the person sat on my back and seemed to be holding knives, or whatever he was sticking in me, actually in my back. he was stabbing me but not taking the stabbing device out of me. so whenever i would writhe in pain (i actually felt pain) it would hurt worse...it was really terrible and extremely graphic. my blood pooled around my face; all i could do was weakly kick my left leg. i would lift it and then it would fall to the ground again. i was saying carol's name, but it came out funny. the person was sitting on my back saying really awful things to me. and all i could do was just lie there and die.  i could almost understand having this dream after having watched a good scary movie, but that just wasn't the case. weird. now i have a headache and a really unpleasant vision in my head.

       Last night i couldn't sleep. I kept staring at adolfo iv and his mother. i got up and watched some  urlLink bad tv . i ended up drinking a 'dose' of nyquil to finally knock me out. i lay in bed staring at adolfo iv, and then i coughed. he startled awake and cried. his diaper was heavy with pee. i changed him quickly and he turned to carol to eat.   Earlier in the day, i took on the second mission on ghost recon. it was the ethiopian factory that paul, dave, chuck, and i had so much trouble with the first time we played. i didn't finish the battle, but i did make my way into the factory and destroy the bomb squad. then, thinking i had the entire place secure, i moved too quickly and was chopped up. it was ugly...no screenshots.

       I've often thought that these are not heroic times in which to live. Political parties seems as if they are screaming "Less Filling" to one and "Tastes Great" to the other. The differences aren't substantive because there are few demons left to be slain. On the other hand, this is a pretty nice situation. It could be like Venezuela, where it seems like the liberating general is refusing to step aside like that noble Roman warrior-farmer. "It's grim, it's really grim," writes the author of the weblog  urlLink Caracas Chronicles . What is even grimmer is that in these non-heroic times, the desire for perfect ethics trumps passion, and the  urlLink New York Times  doesn't want the author to write a weblog while being a correspondent of the Times.

       blogger still isn't publishing the page. i would hate for this to work out this way. i'll try this again from home later tonight. maybe i'll have better luck then. i would hate for us to be reading each other's posts in the 'posts' page.   yeah, killy gets top billing. but i made adolph an admin as a token of good will. maybe i'll make todd an admin too. once the page finally gets posted he'll prolly be so 'frustrated with the shitty layout' he'll code up a new template like he's always wanted to anyway.   meanwhile, adolph will dazzle us with his semantic flash skills.

       These are like little letters to no one in particular. A letter to ourselves whenever we get around to thinking "what is it that I was doing before what I am doing now?" In some ways, I'm constantly thinking about putting the little things I think about into something like a blog, but the chronological order of weblogs is really unappealing. It reminds me of the worst aspects of periodical publishing: you got a be periodical rather than when-everly. Maybe in fact, a blog can indeed be a pure when-everly. However, I would prefer something that wasn't based in chronology but semantically. I'm imagining it would look like Kurtzweil's  urlLink "The Brain."  It is a Java applet; I wonder if it  would be possible to execute it in Flash?

       Here I am again. I have another blog floating in limbo here, somewhere. I forgot the login and password. I wonder if blogger will take down a site that hasn't been touched in however long? i wonder...  houston is becoming mild again this week. it won't be until thursday that the temperatures drop again and perhaps, more rain. but till then, the clouds are disappearing and the sun is coming back, which means that i can take the baby for a walk without having to bundle him up silly.  i'm heading to kimberly's right after work today to process some film. hopefully, there isn't so much. i like the money, but i like my time much better.  here's one:

          wow, it worked. i ftp'd something from work. in any case, this is one of the shots that i took of the baby out in front of the apt this past sunday. that astia does still looks a little bluish magenta doesn't it? i called up HPI to see if they were processing using Fuji chemistry. They said they were not, but that they weren't using Kodak chemistry which renders fuji film extra blue. They were using a different brand (i can't remember the name), so i took a chance. I guess i'll have to call around and see if i can find someone who's using fuji chemistry. (please not Adtech, please not Adtech)

        thanks for the kudos killy. and you are not alone in being unable to view adolph's widget. he has lamented the fact that blogger will not let him embed flash elements. which baby movie are you going to post? did you get an ftp program for the pc?  as far as the light meter goes, i guess you now know the problem is not with the digiCam you were using. that's lame.    yesterday evening diana found a little hurt bird in the driveway. she bundled it up in a tea towel and carried it upstairs for further bundling in a few of my old t-shirts. unable to find a responsive animal shelter at that time of night we made the little guy as warm as possible and hoped for the best. the bird did not make it. it was heartbreaking this morning to see this helpless little thing, dead in its safe little nest, a piece of crumbled bread nearby .

       dude! i love it! imovie is the coolest thing ever. i'll have to post the baby movie tomorrow. i'll upload it over night. so where's adolph's 'flash widget of the evening' anyway? i'm the only one who can't see it?   for todd:    something is definately wrong with my light meter. the ambient metering seems to work great, but the flash meter is totally kaput. all the photos we took came out super underexposed. i guess i should have guessed something was up when you said, "wow, really? that's a strong little flash you got..." (not to mention the fact that had it not been for my using a digital camera on my last commercial shoot everything i would have shot would have been 3,4 or 5 stops underexposed----God bless digi cameras!) it said f/22 but all the exposures (and i did bracket) were at least 3 stops underexposed. at most the flash was spitting out f/8. in that case, i shouldn't have been using nikon anyway cause i could only have sync'd at 1/125. i should have loaded up the bronica, shot it at 1/500 at f/8. even that would have been pushing it. maybe i could have pulled the film a stop (iso 25 - proper exposure for astia is iso 80) and then processed it regular? it's a good thing i have 27 rolls just lying around!  although, the pics of the baby out front came out kinda nice....i was looking for a different quality than what i got...perhaps i should have had the film push- processed a little for some contrast.     for adolph:  thanks for bringing over the burner last night. i'll try to get all the burning i need done before the weekend arrives.

       I remember one time when Todd,  big hairy guy that i cant remember his name right now, and I polished off many a pitcher of beer at the triple crown and followed by show down.  I remember I was so hammered that I had to sleep on Todd's couch but I have had to do that a number of times.  But at the time Todd was loitering around bars alot.  He didnt break anything or anyone or dance on  tables barechested like I heard he does when drunk. He was more self composed than say: Killy who danced to The Cure and many other 80's bands and suffered a collasal hangover for about a week after. Or  Adolph who has in the past ran around San Marcos' Square pissed on the Draft's choices front doors, and the Church of Christ Scientist

        Art Director's Toolkit is the Bomb!      I love products have features you always thought would be cool, but never thought you'd see.  urlLink Art Director's Toolkit  is a mysterious little application that came with my  urlLink PowerBook . The PowerBooks don't come with a lot of built in stuff, like the iBooks with Appleworks, lots of MP3's, etc. But they do come with a licence for Graphic Converter (I already had bought one) and Art Director's Toolkit. It is an app that you'd never think to need as an app (I used to look all this stuff up at various websites or do calculations by hand.    But today I run into the ruler function. It is a little floating translucent ruler that can shift from width to height and display different units of measure (inches, CM, pixels, points, picas), and you can stretch it or shrink it. Very cool.

       I'd say it's about tem thirty. If I care to saunter over to the clock on my monitor.  I have been out on the town for a total of one hour and a half. With my wife and youngest child. We heard sound poetry. Some was as you would imagine. Went to see an old neighbor that was watching our older daughter, Hannah, had some drinks, had some more(me not hannah), and now as night descends on my energy level, all is warm with the romantic filter of booze. I profess love to all sorts of things within a proximity to be close enough to be a part of all of this.  As my head crashes into the pillow in my mind. I say adieu. Big boobs and panty lines. drawing and a twelve pack of something cheap. shit and piss and my homies with a tight grip on a handshake. mutha fuck.  love colin.

       i think prolly the best thing for paul to do is just send the laptop to me. from here we can try the clean install. if it doesn't work, then we can just ship it off to apple easily. then, once we've got it all up and running we can send it back to paul good as new.     i think todd is going to be in Htown for the weekend starting (maybe) tonight, but i haven't heard from him yet. anyone gotten the word from todd?

       Paul, Can we ship you install disks? Where are yours? Do you have the bandwidth/time to pick up entire disk images online? This may be the fastest way to get them across the Atlantic. Is there a local Mac reseller/user group that can help you with an install disk (even if it is French or OS9)? The monitor dongle is a special part for all iBook (Dual USB) and PG G4 12". I'm surprised you didn't bring it with you. You can prolly find them at a local reseller like Fry's. I'm concerned with how primative France is as far as computer stuff goes. Is there a French Fry's? (No pun intended, that was really how it came out of my head..)

       ibook woes:   I am unable to do a clean install cause i dont got my install disks   nor do i have my  external monitor cable (are those things standard or specific  to macs/ibooks?)   i am pretty sure it is an lcd related issue since the lcd no longer comes on;  the few times it does come  on, the machine crashes with squiggly lines across the display;    with no lcd the machine appears to boot up fine     booting with "C" pressed has no effect on the lcd : so one suspects that even having the install disks would be useless    just for fun i  am going to try and reset the  pram and the power manager....    i have also started praying to several dieties    i will prolly end up sending it to killy and request that he help me get it shipped off properly to apple

          urlLink    I'm wondering what's the best way to set up a simple *nix, Apache, MySQL, PHP server. Preferably it would be a *nix distribution designed for headless operation, like a Qube, but oriented towards webserver.     Update:  Jaguar would be nice, if I had a spare Mac laying around the office from March till July. However, I don't. Maybe using  urlLink Darwin  for x86 would be a good idea. Presumably it would run similarly to the terminal on my Mac, so my production server would closely mirror my development machine... urlLink This looks promising ...

       this is pablo writing from the france;  i am writing this blog on a pc with a whacky french keyboard so please bear with any strangly bespelt words.  I am writing this on a pc and not on my ibook because my ibook decided to stop displaying information.  it prefers to whir and beep.  it is, in effect, a  urlLink useless piece of crap .     also,  in response to Adolph's most recent post:  i think Jaguar qualifies as a platform for a simple Apach,MySQL, PHP server.  It is a *nix distribution designed for the arguably headless macintosh community.   my ibook, for example would function perfectly as a simple webserver, especially now that the  lcd is kaput .

         One of the things I enjoy is scoping out is all the little hidden images that are out there on web servers waiting to be used. I wonder if the low image will ever be used. Would the  urlLink Department of Homeland Security  lose budget if they displayed the low alert on their website too long?                                    Notice how there is an odd number, which indicates a mid-point. The mid point is "Elevated," indicating the normal position is more than normal....

It looks kind of like a cross between a sample or demo  Dreamweaver site and a airplane disaster brochure, but it seems completely real.     I wonder who did the drawings. Is it a style that many people use, or is it a specific person doing it? The one on the left says to me, "Walk to the right of hairspray and biohazard construction signs." I wonder if the DHS will make signage graphics for disasters similar to how the DOT makes signage graphics for construction, roadsigns, etc. (I couldn't find a signage link for the DOT.)

            I noticed that this image is (a.) kinda large for this blog format, and (b.) loads rilly slowly, even though I have ample bandwidth here at the office. So I cut the background, shrank it, and put it on a faster host. Oh, and made it face left, on page rather than off page when aligned right. Oh, and I had to turn off annoying text justification with a tag level style call, in this case: &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;    Image File Location:  urlLink http://64.77.69.5/images/sample_image103.jpg      Code: &lt;img src ="http://64.77.69.5/images/sample_image102.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="right"&gt;  added width and height to eliminate browser text rewrapping

Sponser Me  urlLink Blogger .  And the latest, that I just did for the camp fig gallery in austin. There is a show coming up, Thursday March 13, where they sent out blank album covers and told us to make up fake heavy metal bands and do a cover. I sent a cover and a concert shirt. For specific info go to www.campfig.com   urlLink Blogger .  When it is closer to the time of the show I will remind all ya'll in that part of the country to go and see the extravaganza.  love.

       I tell you what, I have been sitting here for the better part of an hour, on netscape, following directions, so I can attempt to put some silly files on this thing, you know, make it real pretty like. Well Fuck all hell if the shit keeps calling me a jackass and telling me "sorry this and sorry that"  I am using Fetch as my "client" and am tring to establish some sort of communication between my web space and this bloggy spot.  Shit.  Ever tried to find your way out of a dark hole with your your eyes closed and your hands tied behind your back and only cursory knowledge of how to walk. Well if not, you should try it.    Love thy pencil and thy brush.  ignorance is still king.  I'm sure you all will see if there is any suckcess.

         hey colin, you need to have access to a web space somewhere. the host for this site does not have enough space for everybody to post all of the pictures they want.  if you have internet access at home you most likely have a little bit of webspace provided by your internet service provider. they will be able to walk you through activating and setting up that space, and, using an FTP program, post pictures on your webspace which you can display on this site.  alternately, you can send it to killy, adolph or myself and we'll post it for you.  although, carol seemed to have worked something out...you might try emailing her.

        Dave asks me today, "What's bad about not having a firing pin spring?" Well, the thing that is bad about it is that if you don't you increase the chance of your firing pin getting stuck and kicking off the round when the bolt closes. Below is a simple flash animation illustrating the principal. When you click FIRE, the hammer swings closed agains the firing pin, which hits the bullet and launches the projectile. When you hit go the second time, you see the bolt slide back, removing the empty cartridge and the bolt move forward, pushing the next bullet into the breech end of the barrel. If the firing pin did not have a spring and got somewhat stuck in the forward position, there is a good change the bullet will fire at that point rather than when the hammer falls.      codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,0,0"  WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="150" id="how_automatic_firearm_works" ALIGN="">          TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer">     urlLink What's the deal with embedding swf on blogspot?

         i like to get to work a bit early, so i can tidy up, maybe play with some of my own pictures, etc. and generally ease into the day. so, here i sit, filling the time with satisfying diversions just waiting for the little clock icon in the corner of my screen to remind that from this point on i'm being paid, and therefore ought to work on something that generates revenue.   in those 18 to twenty minutes i go through what i have to say, what's important, what's in my head. it is the mental equivalent of someone yelling 'fire' in a theatre crowded with rhinos, and the mad stampede of thoughts bottleneck at my inefficient fingers creating another rambling post saying nothing.   diana's leaving, i'm moving back into paul's since i don't make enough to live on my own, and i have a certain capitol intensive project on the semi-distant horizon that  i am saving for, but this is not the place to discuss that.

       it's monday.  i'm at work and things are pretty slow. it was good to hear from colin. i'm also excited that more of us are posting pics on this here blog thing a' ma-jig. although, i would like to see more action shots. i'm thinking maybe a few wide angle shots of adolph kicking the sack, or killy, dressed like a peanut and dancing the lindy hop. dunno.  also, i'm still waiting for paul to send pics of some hot french women.  does anyone remember how paul and colin use to be considered the same person. you would never see one without seeing the other. in fact, they even shared names. people would call paul, colin, and colin, paul. that was a long time ago. now paul is in france and colin is in portland. crazy how things change.  we have all changed so much. the cool thing is that with modern technology we all can still keep in touch. even though we might be seperated my so many miles, streched across as many timezones. still, we can share in each others lives. i feel lucky to have so many friends that i can love and be loved by. (i'm talking about you todd, you little red fire monkey)  everyday i get online i look forward to sharing in new ideas and photos with my friends (even adolphs nerd stuff that i can't understand). and, should mankind see fit to blow itself up in a world wide war for oil i am certain that i'll have time to get off one last email or blog to let you guys know i was thinking of you till the very end. oh, that reminds me, i need to go buy my 'end of the world' bag!

       Hello to everyone,   I have been absent from most of the communications that go on. Since most of it involves "Lets get together and sit around and do all sorts of stuff that sounds like fun." and I get somewhat tired of the sentence "gee I wish my fam and I could come down to play as well."     Shit is weird in the big world, as you grow each day things are colored just a bit more. Experiences, good and bad, allow you to know just how unpredictable all of this is that surrounds us. It is both exhilirating and devastating. Fogive all spelling errors.      I have been involved in possible legal battles over the usage rights to images that I have created. I have lost a job and struggle like mad to find another. I have been all over the town with my new portfolio, had excellent response, had the head of Nike graphic recruitment call me from New York to schedule a meeting. It went excellent, but alas there are no jobs at the moment. I have started a sketchbook that is devoted entirely to the hand. After this many years of drawing I need to finally gain at least cursory knowledge of this part of the human expression. Enough about me.      Laura is still painting like crazy. Her paintings are something quite remarkable. I feel very fortunate to spend my time with an artist that I have so much to learn from. Her paintings have the ability to have so much within them and hold on to this simplicity. To stand in front of it is to allow a story of great complexity and craft to unfold. She has two show next year. She is also homeschooling Hannah and raising up chella.       Hannah is growing quite into a young lady. She is five feet tall and as smart and witty as any grown person could hope to be. It is hard for me to remember sometimes that she is still a child, ten years of age. Her expression has been cultivated ever so carefully by her mother. Hannah has a voice that is strong and her own.    She has been fencing for two years now. Her teacher is a classical french fencing master. He gained the rank of master at the age of 17. he is now 77. to wathch him work is something quite rare. The opportunity that Hannah has with him is one of the cheif reasons we have not moved form this part of the country.    Chella is truly a flower. As I am sure you all are versed with little killy, the child is something that is in us all. You have but to be around one and there, deep inside you, you can feel the aquaintence with innocence. She is growing quickly and is truly a gem. Often I would like to eat her. place her in a pie shell and eat her up. Such a strange sensation,  but there it is.    I still respond to emails,    I still miss each and everyone of you,   I still put on a Dave Mattews record and list in my stance for the embrace of times past amungst friends and a river.   I still write turdy messages to my friends on blog. trog. smog. a-gog.   colin flynn esq.

       well, it turns out that adolph sends back his new 12" powerbook today cause the mouse clicker was 'funky.' so i guess this means another two or three or four weeks of tracking #'s in both directions and hand-wringling waiting. poor adolph; at least he got a couple of cd & dvd burns out of it.  i'm in the middle of a cold that i'm trying desperately to ignore. taggart and liz stopped by yesterday before liz had to head back to clear lake and taggart had to head back to san marcos. he told me more about the sigma digi cam that he played around with this past week. still waiting for photos from that.

       bravo diana! wow...it was powerful...it really stirred a lot of emotions in me, i came away...agitated. seriously, though, that was really fun diana i loved it.  what a fantastic reminder: who needs the gulf war when we've got ghost recon right at our fingertips. speaking of the war, i would really love to go the movies. i think carol and i are ready for a movie, Liz, unfortunately, we are suffereing though a 'time-alone' deficiency. i think it's going to be sometime this week that we go and check out 'talk to her' at the same theater. if we don't go see that in the theater, i'm REALLY going to be in trouble.  also: so NO ONE knows the second meaing of 'coddle'? well, i guess i'll have to tell you; although, before i do i have to say i'm disappointed in todd for not rising to the challenge. not even mentioning it was really a blow to his credibility.  coddle: to boil (cook) an egg at below boiling temp.  isnt' that weird? i mean, who does that anyway? am i EVER going to walk into the kitchen and see a bunch of eggs sitting on the stove in lukewarm water and say to carol, "...are you coddling those eggs?!..." i guess the question is now, WHY would you coddle an egg? does anyone know when you would need to coddle an egg?

        vocabulary test   today i used the word 'coddle' to describe what carol was doing to the baby. out of curiosity (and insecurity, admittedly) i looked it up. to coddle, is to pamper/to care for attentively. there is a second definition to this word. without looking it up, can anyone tell me what that second definition is? it's really odd and i think it would be really cool if someone else knew this.

         Paul writes:   speeding up the glasnost process?  if the history deems the downfall of the soviet union as a good thing it will because not only were people 'liberated' from oppressive governments, but they were 'liberated' without being subjected to the social, economic and humanitarian horrors of all out war....glasnost was good because it was not world war III: it was 'openess', not bombs.         From a humanitarian standpoint, the Soviet Union was killing its own people by the million. Just read  urlLink The Gulag Archipelago . Glasnost came too far too late for those who were subjected to the social, economic and humanitarian horrors of peace.     But your response indicates that you are missing the point. Like the old Soviet Union, the media couldn't put cameras on the people dying every day because of the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government is not open to cameras and the Iraqi government's programs are causing everyday horror to the people there. Until the conflict in Iraq, the eyes of the world have not stirred the fickle passions of European protestors. They have not been allowed to and so the protestors haven't seen fit to decry the destruction of Iraq by it's government. This new openness comes from conflict and nowhere else.

       this is pablo writing in response to the following:   Paul, Just remember, these people on the streets are the same ones that wanted to be "liberated" by Stalin. Europe had riots for a long time because people wanted the Soviets to come in and plan their economies for them. The only reason they are now seeing the suffering of the Iraqis is because of the war; before now, the media couldn't put cameras on the people dying everyday because of the Iraqi government's "palaces, not food" program. We're just speeding up the glasnost process.   speeding up the glasnost process?  if the history deems the downfall of the soviet union as a good thing it will because not only were people 'liberated' from oppressive governments, but they were 'liberated' without being subjected to the social, economic and humanitarian horrors of all out war....glasnost was good because it was not world war III: it was 'openess', not bombs.

        urlLink  Top 10 Lists: Top Ten Myths About the War in Iraq    (pablo posting) here is an excerpt from the link:   6-The world opposes the U.S. invasion of Iraq, so the world must be right. The rest of the world is different. One difference is that the rest of the world is more risk averse. They would rather tolerate Saddam and the threat he represents than take risks to eliminate his murderous tyranny. Moreover, many people in the rest of the world consider it more important (and a lot safer) to feel right than to do right. That's why everyone tolerates murderous situations in Congo, Sudan, Rwanda and North Korea. Saddam has killed over half a million Iraqis and driven 15 percent of the population into exile. The killing continues while the world preaches patience. Now the killers are getting killed, and soon the terror will be gone. Who is right?    not really very convincing, im afraid....

       It's a howitzer. If you can see it, you probably need to back up a bit to shoot it. Everybody in artillery talks about using as a direct fire weapon, much like tankers talk about using the tank cannon as indirect fire (I forget the name of the attachment you use to do this...).     In reality, 38 is fine for a vehicle that is meant to be behind the FLOT. The reason why the M1 has more speed is so it can act a lot like guys on horses: lots of back and forth and attacking quickly and exploiting flanks, etc.

       *   The M109A6 Paladin howitzer is what i consider to be a long distance liberator. the problem with this is that you really have no idea how many you have liberated until you roll up and take a look. since the M109A6 Paladin howitzer can only travel at the speed of 38 mph, the liberated will have long since been buried by the time you reach them.

       so i finally managed to process some film the other day. lucky for me i didn't try to print it.  i distracted myself while i was processing the film, and i accidentally let it sit for 3 minutes without agitating it. i'm sure taggart and todd will know what i'm talking about. the damage doesn't come through all that well if you moderately adjust the images, but if you try to make really radical changes....you can see it real bad.

               Why of course the people dont want war. ... That is understood. But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship ...Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.                Who said that? Hitlers accomplice, Hermann Goering (commander of the German Air Force and president of the Reichstag), at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals in 1946.

       One of the things I really like about my job is that I don't really have a job description. It can be hard sometimes but when I build little web apps that make people really really happy, it makes it all worth it.   I wish I could show you guys what I'm working on but it is all behind-the-scenes kind of glue stuff. It is all kind of boring and non-interesting too, but I'm learning a lot about how to make stuff that works, make it fast, re-use stuff that is already there, and put data into different database products.

       Hey Dave, Operation Iraqi Freedom is definately folly. It is going to be expensive. We would probably get more bang for the buck by selling the Iraqis weapons on credit so the wogs in the Middles East can concentrate on killing each other. That is France and Russia's winning strategy so far.   Killy, Glad to see you are enjoying the ultimate fruit of being American: Crustless White Bread! Where's the mayonaise? Are you boycotting French-named products?   Paul, Just remember, these people on the streets are the same ones that wanted to be "liberated" by Stalin. Europe had riots for a long time because people wanted the Soviets to come in and plan their economies for them. The only reason they are now seeing the suffering of the Iraqis is because of the war; before now, the media couldn't put cameras on the people dying everyday because of the Iraqi government's "palaces, not food" program. We're just speeding up the glasnost process.

I'll start to look into getting your box back to apple for repair. do you think you could forward me the email that you received with all the 'apple info'? that would really help.  it was a nice treat to see it packed with a french newspaper. i'm sure the images you see on your end are much more real than what we see here.

More specifically, 616 St. John,  right past the intersection of Airport and N Lamar. In the custom of those around me, (my new neighbors), I am celebrating by raising my 40oz and giving a shout out to my hommies.

        i have to agree with adolph, mostly because he is smarter than me. while i do not  believe the vast majority of what the government tells me, i do believe that life for the average iraqi is pretty crappy.   my only hope is that this action, once completed, returns the country to it's people, and not just handpicked powerbrokers installed by the US. we have quite  history of placing people in power who are no better or more just than saddam, they're just willing to play ball.   maybe this is unrealistic, but it seems to me that if the UN had decided this issue was worth fighting for, and that they meant it when they said iraq must be disarmed, the combined force of those countries being parked outside iraq may have led to a much shorter conflict, if any. standing up to the US, Brits and Australians is one thing, knowing that if you can just bog the war down enough, and make it messy enough, maybe the will of your enemy will change, political presure will win out, and they'll go home. i think most of the iraqi leaders are power hungry enough to take that chance. but if you throw in a few more industrialized nations that scenario goes away and you're faced with certain, untimely death. that may have changed a few minds.

         paulmercado1: i can get past the "war is terrible thing"   paulmercado1: i just cant get past the   paulmercado1: climate that this crisis has caused paulmercado1: it has agited everyone and unified no one     I think that the people who are agitated are the people who have been itching to be agitated. Having worked customer service a bit, I have grown to notice people who seem to be just waiting for something to complain about at length. The French political structure has been waiting for something like this to come up to be able to make a stand against the "hyperpower" boogie-man they've been talking up for some time.     Conflict rarely unifies people. It would seem that this is the basic nature of conflict (as in people are disagreeing about something) and it would be dumb to expect that this one is any different. For more than a decade, the US along with the rest of the world has been engaged in a conflict with Iraq. We set out some conditions for the closure of that conflict and after the liberation of Kuwait changed our stance from military conflict to an economic and political conflict.     For over ten years this has been ineffective. Iraq hasn't fulfilled its end of the bargain. As a result, the economic conflict has inflicted great hardships on the people of Iraq. The US change in stance from economic and political conflict to military conflict reflects the sense of urgency we have in eradicating the sources of threats that before September 11, 2001 didn't seem like such a big deal.      This change in perspective on the part of the US has become a source of conflict within the "we" that has been in conflict with Iraq. It seems that a lot of people see the world with the same perspective that they did before the terrorist attack on New York City and Washington, DC. That's fine, they have a different perspective, and don't have the sense of urgency that the US government does. As a result, when the US government indicates the source of their urgency, people with a different perspective think "Stupid Americans, don't they know that the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, not Iraq?"    The sense of urgency in confronting the Iraqi threat doesn't come from direct links to the present-day asymetrical military conflict known as terrorism. It comes from acting against what's next and completing old unfinished business. Despite ricin in French subways, it seems like the French gonvernment still thinks there is plenty of time, that countries like Iraq are not credible future sources of asymetrical military conflict. If people are agitated about this, about the state of conflict between the US and countries like France, well then it seems like they are pretty easily agitated.    At a personal level, I'm curious about the thought process of people who are against the Iraq military conflict. It is pretty much agreed that the sanctions have made life pretty crappy for the average Iraqi. In fact, it is so bad that people are saying that the sanctions are killing people. Despite the economic sanctions, the government of Iraq has the resources to build a bunch of "Presidential Palaces" even as people can't get food and medicine. As bad as military conflict is, the economic and political conflict have hurt more for longer. Wouldn't it be in the interest of the Iraqis, humanity, and peace to have it over with than drag it out?    Things in the US are normal, as much as the media makes of it, nobody really cares about the naming of French Fries or anything else French. To say that nobody really cares about what anyone in France thinks would be an unfriendly ad hominem. However, it would be folly on the part of any French person to think that their world perspective has much relevance to America.

       Eyewitnesses Report Seeing Wounded Saddam Being Carried From Compound Fri Mar 21 2003 10:32:01 ET   Intelligence sources now say there were eyewitnesses at the scene where Saddam Hussein's complex was bombed on the first night, ABC reported Friday morning.   John McWethy, ABC's national security correspondent, said on air: "Those eyewitnesses say that they saw Saddam Hussein being taken from the wreckage on a hospital gurney, that he had an oxygen mask over his face. In addition, intelligence sources say that there is a lack of communication between Saddam Hussein's office and his main commands and the rest of his government.    "They are interpreting that as meaning that there is some problem with his health. So they are optimistic that something has happened to the leader of Iraq, but they are still extremely cautious about what his condition is."

       ya know adolph, i did some research and you know what, he didn't have missiles, you're right!  i think we should update the art of war so it fits in more with this modern war.  Sun Tzu revised,  "Thus, the best policy for the military operations is to gain victory by attacking first with the full might of your army, crushing anyone in your path, and let god sort them out (this should be done in the name of peace). Next best policy is to disintegrate the enemy's alliances by calling them all 'evil'; the inferior way is to reach a peaceful solution by means of diplomacy; the worst way is to try and use any kind of strategy other than total fucking war."  now this is a Sun Tzu that we as americans can love and respect.  i can almost hear the cries of the iraqi children as they watch all of hell unleashed upon them. can you hear it adolph? isn't it music to your patriotic ears?  god bless all of our missiles. may they liberate all of mankind. amen.  .

         i think it was Sun Tzu who said,  "the best policy for the military operations is to gain victory by means of strategy. Next best policy is to disintegrate the enemy's alliances by means of diplomacy; the inferior way is to launch an attack on the enemy; the worst way is to storm cities and seize territory."  soon we shall see if this theory still applies in our modern world.  http://www.chinavista.com/experience/warart/warframe.html

         paul,  if you sincerely want to support this administration then you must do the following;  first, you must remain as ignorant of world events as possible. i suggest reading or watching fox news.  second, if you wish to make a statement in favor of our country or our war on drugs, terror, oil, freedom, ect., make sure you are speaking to a cop, exxon/mobile CEO, the F.B.I, or a fellow republican. (this seems to work for bush.)  third, if you know of anyone who does not support any of the wars that we as americans have the right to fight, label them as a terrorist and kill them with a bomb.  paul, always remember, just because we expect that other countries follow U.N. resolutions, or face being invaded, does not mean that we have to.  oh, i almost forgot, make sure you live every day of your life in fear of those different from you, especially the darkies.  this should be your daily mantra,"better them than us."  oil is king! long live the king!  d.

       oh todd, i'm so glad that you got to it first. i haven't had a chance to sit down and put all that stuff together. although, i DID get a chance to print out a 16x20 test of the photo on the hp, which, because of an importing error, was actually printed to 23.45 x ?.....  it looked really great; a little 'soft', but it had a nice quality to it. i'm going to try my hardest to get a good one out today. i upsized it to 16x20 @ 300 dpi (ppi?)...it took a little bit, but my processor on this box is pretty fast. it crunched it out in about 3 minutes, maybe less. there are other issues to deal with, though. it prints a lot darker than i expected, so i've got to lighten the image up. in any case, thanks for putting up that gallery. i'll have to send the link out to family.    pual: last night i went to sam's to buy wipies for the baby and 6 stalks of romaine hearts for your wife. as i was leaving, i bought myself an icee and thought of you when i saw the greasy pepperoni pizzas spinning under the heat lamp. we miss you.

          Hi Liz,  it's time for a little HTML refresher. Below is what you coded. There are a few things wrong with this. Within the entry screen of the blog, you should not enter an   or   tag. This is taken care of the blog's web page. Also, you should close the Hyperlink &lt;a href="something"&gt; tag with its closing tag &lt;/a&gt;.

         Taggart, I'm imagining that their help lines are as clogged as the money acceptance lines. I was on the verge of calling or emailing them because it kept telling me that there was something wrong with my home phone number. But there isn't a listing on the iTunes 4 buy-music form for phone number. The trick is to go into your Apple Store account and set up your billing info there and correct your phone numbers, etc. Then go back to iTunes and back up to the agreement. Re-accept the agreement and you should be home free, at least I was. I'm going to check in on Macintouch and see if anyone else encountered/fixed this.

       For Some Reason it will not let me confirm my credit card info. So I cant buy anything.........and I could have saved you about ten bucks as well adolph I already have that album.  Is the quality lower. 128 bit rate of AAC it SHOULD be CD quality. And you can burn that CD at least 10 times............................in theory that cd could be encoded back from audio to aac with just a fraction of loss and not much if you encode it at a higher bit rate RIGHT?

        Picked up the new Beck album with iTunes music service. In some ways honesty is going to be hard. It isn't that we can just share files amongst ourselves anymore with the AAC encoded bits bought from the Apple store. We can burn each other mix albums, which is honest, and stream the tunes, but it'll work a bit like mildly enforced honesty, there'll be ways around it but they'll be things you have to go out of your way for. If Taggart stores his songs on my HD as a back up it'll be just that. I can't access them without "authorizing" myself.   On the other hand, the music is much cheaper (although for lower quality) and tres handy. They don't have any Yo Lo Tengo or Kronos Quartet, but it is hard for me to put together the time and remembrance to go to the music store. I'm digging it.

       i've been thinking a lot about chess lately. and because of that, i also started to think of that travelling chess set that i lost some time ago. i think the last place that i remember having it was after a day of work at adtech, in taggarts old prelude. has anyone come across this? anyone? remember it taggart? i always thought that i might find it once i moved out of that apt., but it turned out that i wasn't even thinking of it when i did, so i never even thought to look for it. did you happen to ever come across it?

           adolph:  we should really make more time to go and hang out now that you're 'on vacation', so to speak. i mean, aside from that very short day we ended up at poppa burger, we hardly get out anymore. should we make some time to head out to rudyards for a beer after work? i'm on my bike, i can be there right before 5.

         urlLink  Mac Central Coverage:     The new iPods are lighter and thinner than two CDs, Jobs explained. Scroll wheels have been moved atop the scroll wheel and the FireWire plug is on the bottom. Apple is also shipping the iPods with a dock. The dock also has line out for hooking iPods up to stereo systems. USB 2.0 has also been added for Windows users.     He said that a problem with some music services are that "they're slow as molasses and craps out halfway through." You end up "working at under minimum wage" at this rate and you're stealing, Jobs said. But Apple knows how to overcome these problems.

       yes, a most desperately needed weekend off. so anyway, the weekend starts off pretty hectic with a bus ride home and a quick ironing job on a clean shirt. then, running off to missouri city for my sister's confirmation; a ceremony that lasted  two hours!  I wasn't expecting that. I think the starch came out of my shirt, i was sitting there so long.  After that (9 p.m.) we headed to the 'after ceremony' party at Corelli's, an italian restaurant in the burbs (although, i think there's one around here, i think.) Barbara, 15 yrs., had invited all her friends from school to her 'party' which ended up being about 12-15 high school freshmen. They sat at one big table laughing and having a good time for about two hours. They even got a free piece of cake by pretending it was Barbara's bday; i guess they don't check for id's (note to self: half-price cake night is now too expensive.)  Carol, the baby and i sat with my mom and a couple of other parents who had shuttled the kids out there at a booth a suitable distance away. Funny, we had a pretty shitty dining experience ourselves. Here is a list:  1. The appetizer took  way  too long to get there. 2. Salad orders were all mixed up. ("I ordered a caeser, not a house salad...") 3. When my mother ordered a water, she got a sprite 4. The food, which is normally pretty timely, just took way too long. 5. They forgot to put the shrimp in my mom's fetuccini.(sp?)  Seems pretty odd to me that i would have a shitty dining experience on friday night? anyone else have problems?  Saturday morning carol and i had breakfast at empire. It was a beautiful saturday; hot. We walked by a couple of garage sales on the way home. Carol bought the baby a toy.  I got on the road about 2: 30. I killed the time by talking to colin. We must have talked for a little over an hour of my ride; from Brenham to right outside Austin. I got to holly's right at 5. We immediately went for food and a margarita. Not wanting to fight Eyeore's b-day or the City-wide Garage sale, we stayed north and ate at Curra's. The margarita's were good - i got a buzz - but that's all i can say.  Taggart showed up at holly's and took us to the ranch house where carl's party was. Unfortunately, it was winding down. It did, however, reconvene at carl's pad. We drank beer and wandered around his house, landing, eventually, in front of his 'digital imaging center'. Truly amazing what one can do with unlimited funds. Really. A whole slew of really kick ass toys.  Aside from that: boring. A beautiful house full of cool toys and 'fucked-up' (in  that  voice>) frat boys: all there for his viewing pleasure. We took Holly home and i slept on tag's green couch.  I'm sure taggart loved his 7:30 wake up call. I'll let him describe it. Two cups of coffee later and a visit from todd, i was back on the road to houston at about 9:15. I had forgone breakfast. I was anxious to get back home. As innocuous as the weekend sounds, it was good for me; i got in a lot of thinking time -  good  thinking.  and so i got home at 11:30 and made these.

        Looks like we're taking the weekend off, eh? Hello out there?   Taggart, Liz and I got together for drinks at Ernie's Friday, margaritas and gin and tonic and Amber dropped in later fresh out of class and meetings and we soaked in the sun and shade on the second story deck of the place drinking and chatting. Moved on to a despirately terrible dinner at Reggae Cafe "We'd like to start with a couple orders of Coco Bread..." "Sorry, but we're all out of that." "Okay, then maybe a small, no, large order of fried plantains..." "We don't have those either, the plantains, their all too green; they're making patties though..." No jerk chicken either and after ordering the goat I am amazed by the smoky taste of the rice. "Man, it tastes like I just took a bong-hit, I say, and after a couple more bites Taggart says it tastes like cigarettes and then it all tastes like ashes to me and we dither about leaving and how we should not pay for this stuff which had rapidly turned inedible. This was after the thoughts of just leaving since they didn't seem to have any of the stuff for which you go to Reggae Cafe. Liz talks to the waitress and after some confusion we leave for the Angelika to see The Pianist, which was a wonderful film.

We all started somewhere and I know I started by just diving in, accepting mysterious acronyms, and along the way I found  urlLink useful sources  and encouragement, like  urlLink "HTML is easy as hell."    I think that sometimes people are overly willing to cultivate ignorance by politely avoiding topics or language that isn't understood by the other party, but if someone really wants to know about something and asks about it, then you can't talk down to someone.    urlLink   SARS Fashion Sweeps Asia!

        adolph:  carol's mom is coming to the valley for the very  specific  purpose of being picked up and brought to houston. she is going to stay with maru for a week and then fly to chicago so she can visit the family over there. i don't know how long she will be staying. even ONE trip to the valley is a long time to spend in a car with three people and a baby. you're right. it's gonna suck.   liz:  sorry for the 'not so appropriate for work' link. but be careful! this is a boy-blog full of 'boy-love' (amber's words). if you roll over a link without touching it, the address is displayed on the bottom of the ie window. that way you won't be surprised the next time you click on a mysterious link. with adolph talking about amber and 'boy-love' and his being able to 'talk' freely on the blog, i just had to do  something .  i really hope adolph checked that out by the way. i know he is gonna love it. it's cloudy outside today.

So I clicked on the "offend" link...AT WORK...and didn't give myself, or Baylor IT, the chance to be offended. You need to warn us! Well, my last day is next Friday anyway WOOHOO! No work for a month. Is anyone up for a barbecue in our new back yard on May 7 for Diana's going away party? Todd: is this a good weekend? I really want to do something, but I should really ask yu guys first. Speaking of getting Amber in on this, what about Diana? That way we could hear from her in Portland. Cool.

         So Killy, I'm trying to comprehend this: Carol's mom may be coming to the  valley  for the  weekend . If she does, you are going to drag her up to Houston? It's like 6 hours min each way right? Since you are driving down then driving back to pick her up and then again to bring her back, that would be like 24 hours of the weekend in the car, twelve of which would actually be spent with her (and Carol and the baby, all in the car)?   Wow, that's pretty ambitious.

       it's always been 'i might'. my whole life is 'i might'  now , taggart. actually, carol's mom may or may not be coming to the valley this weekend. if she is, then we have to go and pick her up and bring her to houston for a visit. she will be staying with maru (thankfully.) i don't think she's gonna show up (i'll find out today) but if she does, well, i can't go.  retirement party, eh? well, isn't my face red. that would have been terrible if i had shown up in a bday party hat!   adolph:  your subtle hint at driving together to san marcos is so sweet! but i think i'll prolly drive up there alone. i want to stop in on holly and she what she's up to these days. supposedly, she'll be in town this weekend. if anything changes i'll let you know. i know how much you like taking long road trips with me.

         Amber sensed that there was a lot of "boy love" (her term) happening and didn't want to intrude. She promised me that she wouldn't read it so I would feel free to write whatever came to mind.   On the other hand, we just aren't being as raunchy as we used to be in email (this is not an admission of my own), so maybe we should invite her in.

        yay taggart!   i remember when i turned 27....wait a second, no i don't. have fun at threadgills, eat a whole mess o' livers.  can anyone else access the template for this site? i have tried in vain a few times and am not sure what has happened.  beginning the last phase of the move today, a fact made even more interesting when one considers that the room that i am moving into is still a functioning darkroom, sink and all.

       Just giving a shout out...Tomorrow, 5/30, is Taggart's 27th birthday. His mom is coming into town to take us all out to Threadgill's to eat fried chicken livers. Yumm.  This one's for the ladies who want to post recipes here! I made pan fried chicken for the first time this week. And mashed potatoes to go with it. Taggart put in a few  cloves of garlic (not heads, Adolph) and made them pretty good. Did you know that if you have enough garlic in your system it works as mosquito repellant? Lile Bio-Diesel, but Bio-Off. Let Adolph put his "mosquito repelling" Thai salad on here. I'd love to have that again! So the boys scarffed it up and the whole house smelled like fried chicken. We even opened up the windows and turned off the AC for "atmosphere" of old south. I used the Betty Crocker recipe. "Pour in lots of grease and fry." More recipes later.

         One of the difficulties of online content management tools is that their primary content input is the web form. Blogger has this problem too. The web form is the lowest common denominator of any text editor, notwithstanding the rise of Flash and Com object WYSIWYG in browser text editors and the inclusion of an in-form spell checker in Safari and other browsers. On the other hand, with a profusion of excellent tools and a wide-open file system for content management I wind up with a home directory of 30 gigs! This does contain my mp3 collection of some 10 gigs or so and I do a lot of work stuff on this computer, but is still pretty ridiculous.

         Todd,  I was reading  urlLink Anil Dash's Daily Links  and found an  urlLink interesting designer for hire biz-model .   You know I don't know my own phone number; I'm waay to stupid to remember any numbers. However, I do keep a  urlLink vCard on file  at chairjockey. You can download it into your Mac OS X address book and have my full details at your disposal. It even works great in windows. And I've added it to the sidebar of the blog.    If you d/led it and it didn't have cell digits, then d/l it again, it does now.

This year is the 82nd Grand Tarpon Rodeo, which means it started when my great-grandfather was about 21 or so.

         urlLink "They say the company could be even stronger than it is if it could carry out a clear, decisive information technology strategy. PepsiCo does not consistently share best practices, such as Frito-Lay's groundbreaking mobile computing ideas, among business units. The company struggles to integrate information systems across divisions, which largely operate as separate entities."  Sounds like anywhere, really. Sounds like the place I work for. In some ways Pepis may be playing it smart, even if in error, to "let a thousand flowers bloom," as long as they let bad ideas fail fast instead of subsidizing them.

        Yesterday, I went with Amber and some of her friends to the Museum of Medical Science. Amber's friend Sarah's boyfriend Brian (in attendance) is a curator there, and his recent project has been putting in this exhibit about forensic science in solving crimes. I thought of this today because of one of the really neat things they have in the exhibit: a televisual microscope. You can put something under it and zoom waay in and focus. You can put all manner of objects in front of the lense, like you hand, where you can  watch the oil slowly well from the pores of your fingers.   Brian also sez you can hook it up to a video recorder and make tapes of what you put under there. I think you could do really cool things with this.

         Taggart, Todd,  don't forget to not upgrade to iTunes 4.0.1 as  urlLink it breaks sharing outside of your subnet  (i.e. all the way to AusTex).  I was thinking this afternoon that I would kind of like a mashup between the Safari and iTunes, or at least an iTunes control on my Safari toolbar. maybe iTunes is already this magical product as it seems to have a web browser built in to surf the music store, and that browser engine is undoubtably Safari. I wonder how you could get iTunes to point to something outside of the iTunes Music Store....

         I had a new thought yesterday or the day before,  I think it was the day before yesterday. It has to do with the problem of users hitting submit more than once. Basically, your web browser is an application that is "stateless." It doesn't maintain some sort of connection between the browser and the server at all times (this statement is a simplification). So, if you click submit on a web page link or on a form and the web server at the other end doesn't respond, then you might click again. Since you just clicked "post &amp; publish" on your blog twice before you got a return, you get two identical entries. The receiving server understood the two posts as two separate requests and responded appropriately.   In this context you might think this is a bug, however in reality it is a feature. If the web wasn't set up this way, you would have all sorts of problems establishing connections and so forth before you could read something as simple as this blog. Since the link of connections that brought this text from the Blogger servers to you is tenuous from the get go, you really don't want a statefull connection.  There are a number of techniques to maintain a pseudo-statefull link between the browser and server, such as cookies, sessions, javascript and the like. These are great, but they aren't very simple. You may have clicked submit a couple of times in Blogger and found out that even though Blogger remembers you when you return, it will still let you make a double entry. So in thinking of a simple solution for this problem I thought up this:    Form contains a hidden field with a random string based on time as the value.   On submit, the receiving web server looks for the random string (and some other piece of form information in the same record) in the database table(s) the data is going into.   If the string is not present, then the server inserts the record and returns the response.   If the string and other piece is present, the server just looks up the record and returns the response as if nothing happened. I don't know if this is a new thing, and I have been using a variation on it for ms150.org e-commerce, but it is a new thought for me.    Using this method, the user never knows if they hit submit once, twice, thrice (chicken soup with rice), and they don't need to know. They just need the return response to know their information was submitted.  -art

       One of the things I like about our blog is that it is rather introspective. There aren't too many links, there isn't too much pointing at websites, there aren't cross links to other blogs, its just a sampling of chatter, post-it boards of stuff between friends for all who care to see.  Taggart, what is it when an image looks like it is on TV? The peaches don't look like you took a picture of them, but rather took a picture of a video of them. There is something about the flatness or the slight-off registration or something. Did you scan in some 1970's film stock with Carl's big drum scanner?

        hey colin, is that bum the one who set up your site? he's pretty alright.  if you want a better url than whiz.whatever you can use  urlLink chairjockey.com  right now there is just the silly butterflash, and storage for blog graphics. when i get back, i can pretty up your code a bit, if you like...you know, center stuff, make pop-ups for the images so people can click through a few at a time, etc.  what are you doing tomorrow (sunday), anyway? we're just down the road and it would be a shame not to get some face time. diana is all settled in; we got her some daisies to pretty up the place, and ran various and sundry errands, and i think she is sick of me, so i am free to be 'off the leash' tomorrow.  hillsboro (correct spelling) is a bit removed from portland to really be called a suburb (also correct spelling), but it is connected by rail to rainytown. for the princely sum of $1.55 (and an hour or so of your day) you can be shuttled directly to the heart of pLand in relative comfort. unless you are sitting next to one of the pacific northwest's smellier...i mean 'naturaller' citizens. especially the portly ones.

         urlLink Homeland Color Coding a Joke    I've been kind of wondering about this, but after I read this timeline, I'm thinking that the color coding stuff is counter productive since it kind of announces when the Homeland Security guard is down. On the other hand, they could change the code to Green-Low and snare all the terrorists as they come running up with all their bombs, box-cutters, material witnesses, crop dusters, etc.

Hey! once the cops have determined that you are not a terrorist, ask if one of them can take your picture while the other has you cuffed on the ground! that would be a funny picture...make sure you have a beard.  i can't wait for colin to get here! i am so excited to see him, laura, and the kids. ha!  the kids ! so then, we'll bbq at the park? is sewall park for alumni too? wouldn't we be exiled to that 'other side' of sewall park where it's normally swollen with families? eewww...

        Killy  I think I got the email out to you;  I was kind of having problems with my yahoo account recently because a relative of mine kept sending 2 megabyte attachments, which, of course, clobbered my inbox and paralyzed my mail service....   if you dont get any maily maily ask adolph for the passwordy stuff cause I am pretty sure i sent him the info...   anyhow    I am in Strasbourg  right now;  as the name suggests this is a franco-german type of french city; it is totally different from Marseilles; not only in terms of how much beer you get for 2 euros, but also in the availability of brautwurst and brautwurst related products that are available;     the people here mostly speak german, which is kind of creepy for me because I have seen too many world 2 movies and stuff;     also , it is more fun to light brown here than in the south of France; I was only in town this morning for a half an hour before I was stopped by some french police officers asking for identification...   I have also been talking with the colin:   We are hoping that we can get a bbq thing on in San Marcos while he is here....wouldnt it be great to hacky sack, drink beer, eat some kind of red meat and swim a little?

         urlLink   I heard this band  urlLink Sunday evening on KTRU . The song was "internationals" and it was pretty yummy stuff. Has anyone else heard of them? Hmmm, it looks like  urlLink their tour  consists entirely of Pacific Northwest venues.  urlLink Ever Onward IBM  lyrics showed up as one of the search results for  urlLink serene band internationals .  11:56 PM- evolution control commitee  /  no time for yes  was fun to listen to too.

       oh yeah! another thing i forgot to mention was that  todd and diana , as of yesterday, were in Laramie, Wyoming. They've made pretty good time after having to drive to Tulsa and Amarillo first to say goodbye to family. They've been staying at Holiday Inn's all along the way, are seem to be pretty pleased with them.  Todd has  not , however, been pleased with the snow that is still on the ground in certain parts of Wyoming. Last night, he had to smoke his cigarette in the cold. He was not happy, but he called me anyway. What a friend. It was near thirty degrees that night, but like any good Texan, he wore his shorts anyway because, Damnit, it's   supposed   to be warm!     i wonder where Todd will be watching the season finale for  urlLink 24  this evening?

       Hmmm,  urlLink PS2's are going to get a price cut  to under 200 bucks. Maybe this summer is a good time to start logging in some GTA time. Also, has anybody seen Dave? I ran into these two odd squares on either side of the Miller theater. They look like set pieces from that Kengo or whatever Japanese swordfighting game that is. As soon as I get my card reader back and can upload images from my camera I'll post pics. In the meantime imagine a square with a pebble-gravel ground, with light-skinned well-grown saplings planted in a grid; the saplings have large leaves like maple trees and lamps in the branches provide gentle leaf diffused light.

        My Dad's Computer Disaster:   Yeah, you know, I still have my parent's Christmas check somewhere on my desk, and now I have another in reimbursement (I love Safari's in-browser spell check) for the drive and so forth. Since my little credit union makes putting a check into it such a hassle, I should probably just cut up the checks and mail him a new computer. Or no, that wouldn't make sense would it? I would have to put the checks into the bank to defray part of the cost of a new computer.    I don't want to put him into an eMac anyway. He has a pretty nice 17 in monitor I got for him a Christmas or so ago. I'd like to find him an older G4. Maybe a Sawtooth like Todd's or something. Since he will have an eMac from school over the summer, he'll be able to wait until the  urlLink 970's come out  and G4's get cheap.

After four months in the too prettily quiet town of Hyeres, it is great to be here, lost among the blur and noise of this huge citie's tight streets.     A few thoughts:     Checkout the beginning of   urlLink  colin's website   The CONVERT link is the only one functional as of it.  The images, as usual, are fucking awesome.  It is also great to see that colin is getting internety.  Will he be posting about RAM upgrades next?   Killy, Adolph: Thanks for getting my computer back in shape.   Killy  check email for the WORD    The Marseille fire department has the coolest helmets. They are shiny and silver like a cavaliers.   I am heading to Munich to visit a friend of mine from Poland.  Anyone remember the noxyema girl?  Anyhow, if anyone knows Munich or the environs and has some advice, etc, on what to see/do let me know!

       you know, adolph, i'm all for using things till you absolutely can't use them anymore, but for the same amount you'll spend on gas, time, and possibly shipping, you could purchase your dad an emac and end these tech trips for at least a year.  sorry the disks didn't work out.

         My Dad's Computer Disaster:   Well, it wasn't the disk. The disks I brought up didn't work at all. Fortunately, I had made a copy (probably with a PC at work) a while back that did work (mostly). My best guess at this point is that it is power supply. I brought the old G3 upgraded  urlLink Powermac 8500  back to my labs in Houston for testing. He is currently set up with his old  urlLink 6100.  It is painfully slow (not too painfully tho), but he is able to get his grades off and read and write email with it. It also has a brand new 18 gig scsi drive that was supposed to go into the 8500. I may get my little sister's G3 upgrade card, VGA adapter and RAM from her 6100 and send that up to Shreveport. Unfortunately that won't solve the problem of no USB port, which means no digital pics and no USB printer for Dad. If anyone knows of an old-style serial to USB converter, I would appreciate a reference. Everything I see converts USB to serial for attaching old peripherals to new computers, not old computers to new peripherals.

       so this morning i woke up with such a full head of mucus that i couldn't get out of the bed. it was incapacitating. so i called in and stayed home. i just got back from kroger where i bought a box of over-the-counter claritin. i guess if it works (i just took it with a glass of water) i have allergies that i never knew i had. bummer....  but on a lighter note...taggart was right! carol and i managed to squeeze in a second viewing of the matrix yesterday afternoon, and it was totally super cool. we made it to the 2:30 showing and got back home around 5. the theater was, expectedly, packed.   adolph:  so, did that/those disk(s) work for you? were you able to work on your dad's box?

       that's totally cool adolph, but i wonder: how long did it take you to actually 'post' that message? are you as good as the japanese are at text messaging?  i assumed that the matrix would be much better the second time. i caught myself looking too hard for cgi stuff and not enough time actually enjoying the flick. that isn't to say that i didn't enjoy it the first time. i was shaking in my seat, it was so cool. i totally loved it so much that i sucked down my icee too fast. i hardly even tasted it. carol had a mustard soaked hot dog right next to me that i didn't even want to turn my head from the screen to take a bite of (i know i shouldn't end my sentences with prepositions.)  carol and i ended up seeing the 11:30 show on friday night. we waited until the baby was fast asleep, and then snuck out of the house. rafa kept an ear out for the baby. carol bought the tickets and i parked the car. the theater was toally packed, but luckily everyone was almost reverently quiet. one person yelled out, "...yes!..." at the very beginning, but that was the only shout out during the whole movie. there was an audible gasp during the 'smiths' fight scene at certain parts, and a couple of chuckles when the annoying little kid in zion handed neo the 'spoon'.  it was pretty damn cool.  saturday had to be the laziest day ever. we didn't want to do anything. carol's allergies are just killing her and i woke up with a head full of mucus myself. i've never had allergies, but i'm beginning to wonder if: A) i am developing allergies or B) the air in houston is getting much worse. i've had this itch in the back of my throat and a stuffed up head for over a week now. dunno why. carol mentioned something about giant fires in south america...  we ended up at my mom's in sugarland        and just lazed around the house. we put adolfo iv in a small plastic pool out in the front yard        then we just sat around and smiled a lot.       then we came home and watched lord of the rings on the tele. i went out for a frappucino, carol sat on the couch with a benadryl. eventually, she fell asleep.  and now it's sunday. i'm poised to wash the car, balance the checkbook, pay bills, get to the studio, pack up the defective stand, do laundry, and burn some cd's so i salvage some sorely needed hd space for movies. i would love to squeeze in a second matrix viewing, but i don't know if i'll have the time.

       Wow looks like everyone took the whole weekend off from the blog. Well just so you guys know that the matrix reloaded is better the second time. and for those of you who actually bought the Wilco Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album. Wilco released yankee in australia with a bonus disk of six songs. For those of us who dont live down under they posted the new songs on a site @ wilcoworld to get to the ftp site you have to insert your original disk click on the enhanced disk then click on the link to their webpage from there.  it will tell you where to go from their and you will need the cd insert from the album. umm I am now off to the lake. enjoy.

       You know, it is the year 2003, shouldn't we just have a little web upload script that accepts an image via http:post and returns with an URL where the image was stored? Extra credit would be for one that (A) puts the image into a respective user's folder via a login (B) makes a library page with all the images that have been uploaded.

        todd:  yes, i did notice it. very well done; but i also noticed that the angle that the shadow suggests the light is coming from, and the angle at which waldo (read: adolph) is standing would not throw a shadow from his arm. the result would be only a torso shadow.  wouldn't it?       boy, if i'm going to be so picky, i don't think i'm going to enjoy the matrix. ha!

        yes, but it looks even better if you make the shadow using a gradient selection. You can also map the shadow to a greyscale image in which tonal value is 'translated' into height/depth.  for more info ::  urlLink check this out.

       Hey Todd! I understand you went to the midnight showing of the Matrix Reloaded! So maybe this recipe is coming to you a little too late, or maybe it will help you through the day today! anyway, here it is Matrix Reloaded Peanut butter and Honey sandwiches!!!  This is an ideal meal to get the adrenaline going for watching the movie or for afterwards.  2 slices 12 grain bread (it's got lots of nuts in it) 6 TBS  Chunky peanut butter 1 TBS  Natural Clover Honey (you could do 2 TBS if you want to be bold, but it's messy) 1 TBS Hershey's liquid chocolate 1 TBS Hershey's powdered chocolate 1 Coca Cola  Toast the bread, spread 3 TBS of peanut butter on one slice and the remaining peanut butter on the other slice.  Drizzle the honey all over one slice and the liquid chocolate all over the other slice.  Sprinkle the powedered chocolate over both slices evenly.  Put the two slices together sandwiching all the mushy stuff in between.  Eat it!  As you will see, it might be quite difficult to chew at first, but with the tried and true corrosive qualities of our favorite  urlLink soft drink , take a swig of coke and enjoy the fabulous rush of energy surge through your being.  Now, enjoy visiting another reality with your mind in this perfect state of readiness.  Thanks!

        urlLink A film that never truly takes flight and always seems to be pulling it?s punches.   Is that because nobody ever seems to get bruised in this film?   That swords seem to do the same amount of damage in this film as they do in the typical TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE cartoon? ...  Instead we just get another martial arts battle with weapons that only seem to really affect solid inert objects.   Though they've opened the door to Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies and what not?  We're not getting them.   We just get more kung fu.   They fucking opened the door to things cooler than kung fu and all they give us are Wraiths for Trinity and Morpheus to deal with, meanwhile   Mr.  THE ONE is left to deal with a bunch of pansy ass Red Shirt Kung Fu fools that apparently might be Angels and Demons and things beyond imagining?  Oh? but we?re not going there?   God forbid one of them AKIRA?s out?   or does anything beyond Wire Fu.

         urlLink Also in the first film, . . .  Much like the masterful way PREDATOR was structured, where there were many badasses, until there was only THE BADASS.  Also . . . the fights had a variety of fighting styles.   Neo or Morpheus would begin in one style, then, when noticing it wasn?t working, they?d improvise and shift to a different martial arts form, with a certain debonair flair.   Here, there?s none of that.

It's pretty standard, as in it's the one I see in most movies, and standard in that since you can mount almost anything it can carry on the nose, Like movie cameras, or guns, or cranes, cats....etc. Since I hated my first helicopter ride so much I am hoping that it was abnormal (the Sickness). The really cool part is that the doors come off and you can dangle your feet from it and spit on things below.

        FROM AMBER FREDA    In case you didn't know, Anthony and I got hitched!!  Actually, "hitched" is far too coarse a term for what was a truly beautiful ceremony ...  We were married on the ocean at Fire Island at noon on June 22, 2003.  Anthony's parents, Elaine and Tony Freda, were kind enough to open their beautiful home to us and our immediate families, for a very small, intimate ceremony.  Anthony and I wrote our own vows -- I remember looking up while we were reading them to see the entire room in tears!  It was a very sentimental moment and one we will always remember with a sense of joy mingled with awe at the seriousness of the journey on which we were about to embark, arm in arm...  It meant so much to us both to see all of our families together, sharing in love, food, dance, drink, and conversation.  Seeing my mom dancing with her father nearly made my cry -- or seeing my dad's wife Gaylene and my mom hugging each other as they bonded and became great friends over the weekend -- and seeing Gaylene and Christine click instantly -- and seeing how beautiful the Freda's house looked for the first time after Anthony's mom and dad worked so hard -- bringing dishes out every weekend on the ferry for months beforehand, the sight of Anthony and his father bicycling in the pouring rain on Saturday to buy flowers to make sure the deck would be full of blooming things the day of the ceremony -- and the beautiful bouquet of yellow roses and burgundy calla lilies that Christine put together for me, and all of the personal touches of warmth and beauty that Elaine added to the table (the lovely lace tablecloths, the fresh flowers, the sea shell favors), I could go on and on....  So many great memories -- We can't thank our families enough for pulling through for us and loving and supporting us so much!!!!  Our parents are already getting excited about having a party / reunion in Texas next Spring -- a BBQ / Cajun crawfish extravaganza -- Texas style!!  Should be fun!  We are still working on putting together some photos / getting some enlargements / cropping a few of the best ones -- so as soon as we have those I will e-mail a few out for everyone to see..  Also in the news, Anthony is going to be on CNN tomorrow, July 1 at around 12:30 eastern time -- it's a live interview featuring him as a New York artist involved in the Public Art project that has local artists painting the outside of portable bathrooms -- it's a functional art project for tourists and locals alike and each one has a 24-hour guard assigned to it to make sure none of these pieces are vandalized and/or damaged in any way..  So, if you get a chance, tune in!!  I taught another one of my Houseplants series of classes at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens last weekend -- it was the best one yet and I even had students coming up to me afterward saying they wanted to take more classes with me in the future -- pretty cool stuff!!  Also, it looks like I will also be teaching classes at the Bronx Botanic Gardens starting this fall...  Hope ya'll are doin' great!!  Have a wonderful summer!! We're going to take our honeymoon in Cancun in January -- can't wait!!  Ciao, Amber Freda

       did you all get the email from amber? Her and good ol' anthony got the balls and chains attached firmly on each others ankles.  About the ibook.   I am looking at the 14" combo drive ibook. I do not think that I need a powerbook for what I do. Thats kinda like carpooling with a Hummer. although I have not really started to consider what preformance will be like when I am fully switched over to OS X and am running Illustrator 10 and Photoshop 7. At Home I am still on OS 9.2. The processor speed on my machine at home is around 126 or something, and seems to work great, so jumping up to the 700 mhz should handle all my needs.  At the Local apple dealer, they have refurbished ones that have a full apple warranty. So who knows. I think I am going to rent one for when I come to Texas and give it a test drive.  About the BAR-E-Q: If we could have it at the city park by Lion's Club would be best. There are shallow areas there where the kids can play.  over and out.

         to all flynnFest participants ::  our field operative, who we shall refer to as 'slim', is currently on the ground in san marcos, scouting locations and the logistics of grilling devices. we can expect a sitrep shortly.  a good time WILL be had by all.  in the event a good time is not had by someone our superiors will be notified, and the trouble maker will be dealt with.  severely.

        re: ibook questions   I looked around a bit too, and asked and burdened local mac experts with lots of questions and I found that for purchasing new it is best to go through the apple site, or your local apple store.  I ordered online and recieved my ibook promptly, with no hassle- for the same price offered at other retail sites/stores.  Also, which ibook are you looking at?  Are you considering not eating for a couple of months and maybe getting a g4 powerbook?

       well, it turns out that eleo wants paul to join her at a 'dancer' bbq if it doesn't rain, and carol is taking barbara to the galleria tonight, which means that the baby is most likely going to stay with me.   the upside:  barbara brought over her ps2 -- and it has  two controllers . can you think of a game you want to rent?

       A longer game is unfortunate? I guess as with anything, you can play a short game or a long game and the winning for either kinda depends on your prediction of which kind it is. Do you think we can get Todd, Taggart or Dave in the game this evening?

       now that i think about it, weren't we trying to share out internet connection to eleo at the same time? i don't remember, but i think this was the case. i hope you are right, considering that you want to increase our population by 25. i think i liked having the population lower, it kept people (read:paul) from flattening you in one fell sweep with a legion of bombard canoneers. it kept the game at a much more even keel, i think. having to trade out resource gathering for an extensive army i think keeps thing more 'realistic', but unfortunately, results in a much longer game.

         Free Ibook Upgrade ?    After reading  urlLink this article          Subject: Apple Replaced my iBook because of screen failures  on macintouch.com I didn't feel so bad about my iBook crapping out on me a couple of months ago.  Apparently many people have had the same problem, and the standard solution is to replace the logic-board, which is what apple has done for me once.  All I need now is for the machine to crap out twice more and maybe I can get a new 900MHZ model!  Also, it is ironic? that one of my arguments for buying a mac was apple's reputation for quality hardware!

        urlLink Killy , I think that network performance could have been hurt by keeping the airport on even though we were using computer to computer. Any latencies brought on by traffic on the same frequency might not hurt file transfer, but may affect AOE. Of course, this is just uninformed speculation.

       Been an interesting couple of days.  Last night we went to blues on the green in Zilker Park and meet the spouses and fiances of Liz's fellow students.  Luke is a designer for Acclaim, he builds and designs the enviroments for their games.  They just finished a Lord of the Rings video game and are starting their new game based  on the Comic Book "the red star". Some time next week I am going to their studio to check out what he is working on. Then there was Drew, he is an architect for Schlotzky's.  He design 's their bluidings, like the one on S Lamar or the new one on Parmer and 35.  Really cool guy.  they are both in thier mid 30's.  Unfortunatley I cannot make it to FlynnFest '03.  I will be leaving for Cheesapeke on the  10th and will be gone till the 16th.

       Well done chaps.  tickets are $150 and can be purchased directly from me, that way there is no service charge.   If anyone has a line to Thomas, pass on the word.  And tell Dave and Ryan as well. I will email them, but just in case.  Should we try to set up some sort of menu in advance or do we just see what happens?  knowing paul it would be a Pringles and some water.  And what about an actuall grilling aparatus. I believe that there are some at the river, but I don't want to have to fight the locals for one. I'm a father not a fighter

        This is really funny stuff my brother spammed me with.  Normally he don't send the crap, but this one he rightly judged was worth it ---->     The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord    1. My Legions of Terror will have helmets with clear Plexiglas visors, not face concealing ones.  2. My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.  3. My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell in my dungeon.  4. Shooting is not too good for my enemies.  5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragon of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object which is my one weakness.  6. I will not gloat over my enemies predicament before killing them.  7. When I've captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?" I'll say, "No." and shoot him. No, on second thought, I'll shoot him and then say "No."  8. After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks' time during which the final phase of my plan will be carried out.  9. I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled, "Danger: Don Not Push". The big red button marked "Do Not Push" will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will clearly not be labelled as such.  10. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum - a small hotel room well outside my border will work just as well.  11. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.  12. One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.  13. All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least several round of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.  14. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other form of last request.  15. I will never employ any device with a digital count-down. If I find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable. I will set it to activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation.  16. I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there's just one thing I want to know."  17. When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice.  18. I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt to usurp power would easily fail, it would prove a fatal distraction at a crucial point in time.  19. I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but one look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd betray her own father.  20. Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss unexpected developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.  21. I will hire a fashion designer to create original uniforms for my Legion of Terror, as opposed to some cheap knock-offs that make them look like Nazi stormtroopers, Roman foot soldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All were eventually defeated and I want my troops to have a more positive mind-set.  22. No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I will not consume any energy field bigger than my head.  23. I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops in their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power generator and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless -- my troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and rocks.  24. I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strength and weaknesses. Even though this takes some fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line "No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)  25. No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and virtually inaccessible spot.  26. No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are, there is probably someone just as attractive which is not desperate to kill me. Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent to my bed chamber.  27. I will never build only one of anything important. All important systems will have redundant control panels and power supplies. For the same reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times.  28. My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot escape and into which I could not accidentally stumble.  29. I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies into confusion.  30. All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be preemptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.  31. All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly, world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcements and/or romantic sub-plot for the hero or his side-kick.  32. I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by.  33. I won't require high-ranking female members of my organization to wear a stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual dress-code. Similarly, outfits made entirely from black leather will be reserved for formal occasions.  34. I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.  35. I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.  36. I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell block, let alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I will keep the only key to the cell door on my person instead of handing copies to every bottom-rung guard in the prison.  37. If my trusted lieutenant tell me my Legion of Terror is losing a battle, I will believe him.. After all, he's my trusted lieutenant.  38. If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring anywhere, I will find them and have them killed immediately, instead of waiting for them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance towards me in my old age.  39. If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite number among his army.  40. I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable super-weapon, I will use it early and as often as possible instead of keeping it in reserve.  41. Once my power is secure, I will destroy all of those pesky time travel devices.  42. When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes and filching keys that happens to follow him around.  43. I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the beautiful rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good looks and will gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on my plans.  44. I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who work for the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even the odds to give the other guy a sporting chance.  45. I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible for what in my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will not draw my weapon, point it at him and say "And here is the price for failure." then suddenly turn and kill some random underling.  46. If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can one man possibly do?", I will reply "This." and kill the advisor.  47. If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I will slay him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for him to mature.  48. I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not immediately come after me for revenge.  49. If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me, I will not send all of my troops out to seize it. Instead I will send them out to seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the local paper.  50. My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.  51. If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the conditions of the beautiful princess' cell, I will immediately transfer him to a less people oriented position.  52. I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to examine my castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I might not know about.  53. If the beautiful princess that I capture says "I'll never marry you! Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!", I will say "Oh well" and kill her.  54. I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.  55. The deformed mutants and odd-ball psychotics will have their place in my Legion of Terror. However before I send them out on important covert missions that require tact and subtlety, I will first see if there is anyone else equally qualified who would attract less attention.  56. My Legion of Terror will be trained in basic marksmanship. Any who cannot learn to hit a man-sized target at 10 meters will be  used for target practice.  57. Before employing any captured artifacts or machinery, I will carefully read the owners manual.  58. If it becomes necessary to escape, I will never stop to pose dramatically and toss off a one-liner.  59. I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am.  60. My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any code I am thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30 seconds, it will not be used. Note: This also applies to passwords.  61. If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?" I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.  62. I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural supports which intruders could use for cover in a firefight.  63. Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors. And they will be kept hot, with none of this nonsense about flames going through accessible tunnels at predictable intervals.  64. I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be disadvantageous.  65. If I must have a computer system with publicly available terminals, the maps they display will have a room clearly marked as the Main Control Room. That room will be the Execution Chamber. The actual main control room will be marked as Sewage Overflow Containment.  66. My security keypad will actually be a fingerprint scanner. Anyone who watches someone press a sequence of buttons or dusts the pad for fingerprints and then subsequently tries to enter by repeating that sequence will trigger the alarm system.  67. No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will be instructed to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a full-scale emergency.  68. I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past. This is only reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the offer is good one time only. If they want me to spare them again, they'd better save my life again.  69. All midwives will be banned from the realm. All babies will be delivered at state-approved hospitals. Orphans will be placed in foster homes, not abandoned in the woods to be raised by creatures of the wild.  70. When my guards split up to search for intruders, they will always travel in groups of at least two. They will be trained so that if one of them disappears mysteriously while on patrol, the other will immediately initiate an alert and call for backup, instead of quizzically peering around a corner.  71. If I decide to test a lieutenant's loyalty and see if he/she should be made a trusted lieutenant, I will have a crack squad of marksmen standing by in case the answer is no.  72. If all the heroes are standing together around a strange device and begin to taunt me, I will pull out a conventional weapon, instead of using my unstoppable super weapon on them.  73. I will not agree to let the heroes go free if they win a rigged contest, even though my advisors assure me it is impossible for them to win.  74. When I create a multimedia presentation of my plan designed so that my five-year-old advisor can easily understand the details, I will not label the disk "Project Overlord" and leave it lying on top of my desk.  75. I will instruct my Legion of Terror to attack the heroes en masse, instead of standing around waiting while members break off and attack one or two at a time.  76. If the hero runs up to my roof, I will not run up after him and struggle with him in an attempt to push him over the edge. I will also not engage him at the edge of a cliff. (In the middle of a rope-bridge over a river of molten lava is not even worth considering.)  77. If I have a fit of temporary insanity and decide to give the hero the chance to reject a job as my trusted lieutenant, I will retain enough sanity to wait until my current trusted lieutenant is out of earshot before making the offer.  78. I will not tell my Legion of Terror "And he must be taken alive-" the command will be "And try to take him alive if it is reasonable practical."  79. If my doomsday device happens to come with a reverse switch, as soon as it has been employed it will be melted down and made into limited edition commemorative coins.  80. If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my best troops instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones as he gets closer and closer to my fortress.  81. If I am fighting with the hero atop a moving platform, have disarmed him, and am about to finish him off and he glances behind me and drops flat, I too will drop flat instead of quizzically turning around to find out what he saw.  82. I will not shoot at any of my enemies if they are standing in front of the crucial support beam to a heavy, dangerously unbalanced structure.  83. If I'm eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have to leave the table for any reason, I will order new drinks for both of us instead of trying to decide whether or not to switch with him.  84. I will not have captives of one sex guarded by members of the opposite sex.  85. I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, e.g. "Align the 12 stones of power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse." Instead it will be more alone the lines of "Push the button/"  86. I will make sure that my doomsday device is up to code and properly grounded.  87. My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, I will not construct walkways above them.  88. If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not berate them for incompetence then send the same group out to do the task again.  89. After I capture the hero's super weapon, I will not disband legions and relax my guard because I believe whoever holds the weapon is unstoppable. After all, the hero held the weapon and I took it from him.  90. I will not design my main control room so that every workstation is facing away from the door.  91. I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and obviously agitated until my personal grooming or current entertainment is finished. It might actually be important.  92. If I ever talk to the hero on the phone, I will not taunt him. Instead, I will say that his dogged perseverance has given me new insight on the futility of my evil ways and that if he leaves me alone for a few months of quiet contemplation I will likely return to the path of righteousness. (Heroes are incredibly gullible in this regard.)  93. If I decide to hold a double execution of the hero and the underling who failed or betrayed me, I will die first.  94. When arresting prisoners, my guards will not allow them to stop and grab a useless trinket of purely sentimental value.  95. My dungeon will have its own qualified medical staff complete with bodyguards. That way if a prisoner becomes sick and his cell mate tells the guard it's an emergency, the guard will fetch a trauma team instead of opening the cell for a look.  96. My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the control panel on the outside seals the door and blasting the control panel on the inside opens the door, not vice versa.  97. My dungeon cells will not be furnished with objects that contain reflective surfaces or anything that can be unraveled.  98. If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I will carefully monitor their activities. If I find they are happy and affectionate, I will ignore them. However, if circumstances have forced them together against their will and they spend all their time bickering and criticizing each other except during the intermittent occasions when they are saving each other' lives at which point there are hints of sexual tension, I will immediately order their execution.  99. Any data files of crucial importance will be padded to 1.45Mb.  100. Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I will provide each of them with free, unlimited internet access.

        I'll be back late tonight,  Killy . I'm pretty happy with the king of the hill game. I pretty accurately thought that the name of the game was to not get too serious about the hill, just enough to keep anyone from having it too long, and focus on resource extraction.     It looks like in  urlLink Panther, iDisk  is going to become something more than a slow web-DAV server connection baked into the OS' menu. If you take a look at the "What's in store..." it looks like iDisk is going to morph into a very useful synched folder, similar to good old Win98's "Briefcase" and Mac OS 7's synchronization assistant.

       I just deployed the awards party application on the little iBook. I think I may serve up the party on it rather than my computer. The Houston awards party was served out on my old iBook 500, so the office iBook SE 466 should do fine for Austin. I'm starting to become comfortable (if not quite fluent) in exporting Mysql databases and reimporting them, table structure and all into a different computer. For some reason, it is a lot simpler with Mac OS than with Red Hat. With RH I had to build Mysql and Php and then find an obscure linker from php to mysql. Everything had a general level of suckitude.

       Hello all! I was waiting for my breakfast taquito when this came on! I had to smily warmly with visions of yesterday in my head.  MONDAY, 23 JUNE 2003 From  urlLink The Writer's Almanac   Poem: "Why I Take Good Care of my Macintosh," by  urlLink Gary Snyder  (used by permission of the poet).  Why I Take Good Care of my Macintosh  Because it broods under its hood like a perched falcon, Because it jumps like a skittish horse     and sometimes throws me Because it is poky when cold Because plastic is a sad, strong material     that is charming to rodents Because it is flighty  Because my mind flies into it through my fingers Because it leaps forward and backward,     is an endless sniffer and searcher, Because its keys click like hail on a boulder And it winks when it goes out,  And puts word-heaps in hoards for me,     dozens of pockets of      gold under boulders in streambeds, identical seedpods     strong on a vine, or it stores bins of bolts; And I lose them and find them,  Because whole worlds of writing can be boldly layed out     and then highlighted and vanish in a flash     at "delete"     so it teaches     of impermanence and pain; And because my computer and me are both brief     in this world, both foolish, and we have earthly fates, Because I have let it move in with me     right inside the tent And it goes with me out every morning We fill up our baskets,       get back home, Feel rich,      relax,      I throw it a scrap and it hums.

        This is really funny stuff my brother spammed me with.  Normally he don't send the crap, but this one he rightly judged was worth it ---->     The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord    1. My Legions of Terror will have helmets with clear Plexiglas visors, not face concealing ones.  2. My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.  3. My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell in my dungeon.  4. Shooting is not too good for my enemies.  5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragon of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object which is my one weakness.  6. I will not gloat over my enemies predicament before killing them.  7. When I've captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?" I'll say, "No." and shoot him. No, on second thought, I'll shoot him and then say "No."  8. After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks' time during which the final phase of my plan will be carried out.  9. I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled, "Danger: Don Not Push". The big red button marked "Do Not Push" will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will clearly not be labelled as such.  10. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum - a small hotel room well outside my border will work just as well.  11. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.  12. One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.  13. All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least several round of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.  14. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other form of last request.  15. I will never employ any device with a digital count-down. If I find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable. I will set it to activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation.  16. I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there's just one thing I want to know."  17. When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice.  18. I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt to usurp power would easily fail, it would prove a fatal distraction at a crucial point in time.  19. I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but one look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd betray her own father.  20. Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss unexpected developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.  21. I will hire a fashion designer to create original uniforms for my Legion of Terror, as opposed to some cheap knock-offs that make them look like Nazi stormtroopers, Roman foot soldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All were eventually defeated and I want my troops to have a more positive mind-set.  22. No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I will not consume any energy field bigger than my head.  23. I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops in their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power generator and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless -- my troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and rocks.  24. I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strength and weaknesses. Even though this takes some fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line "No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)  25. No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and virtually inaccessible spot.  26. No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are, there is probably someone just as attractive which is not desperate to kill me. Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent to my bed chamber.  27. I will never build only one of anything important. All important systems will have redundant control panels and power supplies. For the same reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times.  28. My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot escape and into which I could not accidentally stumble.  29. I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies into confusion.  30. All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be preemptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.  31. All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly, world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcements and/or romantic sub-plot for the hero or his side-kick.  32. I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by.  33. I won't require high-ranking female members of my organization to wear a stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual dress-code. Similarly, outfits made entirely from black leather will be reserved for formal occasions.  34. I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.  35. I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.  36. I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell block, let alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I will keep the only key to the cell door on my person instead of handing copies to every bottom-rung guard in the prison.  37. If my trusted lieutenant tell me my Legion of Terror is losing a battle, I will believe him.. After all, he's my trusted lieutenant.  38. If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring anywhere, I will find them and have them killed immediately, instead of waiting for them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance towards me in my old age.  39. If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite number among his army.  40. I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable super-weapon, I will use it early and as often as possible instead of keeping it in reserve.  41. Once my power is secure, I will destroy all of those pesky time travel devices.  42. When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes and filching keys that happens to follow him around.  43. I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the beautiful rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good looks and will gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on my plans.  44. I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who work for the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even the odds to give the other guy a sporting chance.  45. I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible for what in my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will not draw my weapon, point it at him and say "And here is the price for failure." then suddenly turn and kill some random underling.  46. If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can one man possibly do?", I will reply "This." and kill the advisor.  47. If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I will slay him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for him to mature.  48. I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not immediately come after me for revenge.  49. If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me, I will not send all of my troops out to seize it. Instead I will send them out to seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the local paper.  50. My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.  51. If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the conditions of the beautiful princess' cell, I will immediately transfer him to a less people oriented position.  52. I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to examine my castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I might not know about.  53. If the beautiful princess that I capture says "I'll never marry you! Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!", I will say "Oh well" and kill her.  54. I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.  55. The deformed mutants and odd-ball psychotics will have their place in my Legion of Terror. However before I send them out on important covert missions that require tact and subtlety, I will first see if there is anyone else equally qualified who would attract less attention.  56. My Legion of Terror will be trained in basic marksmanship. Any who cannot learn to hit a man-sized target at 10 meters will be  used for target practice.  57.

Note: This also applies to passwords.  61. If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?" I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.  62. I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural supports which intruders could use for cover in a firefight.  63. Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors. And they will be kept hot, with none of this nonsense about flames going through accessible tunnels at predictable intervals.  64. I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be disadvantageous.  65. If I must have a computer system with publicly available terminals, the maps they display will have a room clearly marked as the Main Control Room. That room will be the Execution Chamber. The actual main control room will be marked as Sewage Overflow Containment.  66. My security keypad will actually be a fingerprint scanner. Anyone who watches someone press a sequence of buttons or dusts the pad for fingerprints and then subsequently tries to enter by repeating that sequence will trigger the alarm system.  67. No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will be instructed to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a full-scale emergency.  68. I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past. This is only reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the offer is good one time only.

If my doomsday device happens to come with a reverse switch, as soon as it has been employed it will be melted down and made into limited edition commemorative coins.  80. If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my best troops instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones as he gets closer and closer to my fortress.  81. If I am fighting with the hero atop a moving platform, have disarmed him, and am about to finish him off and he glances behind me and drops flat, I too will drop flat instead of quizzically turning around to find out what he saw.  82. I will not shoot at any of my enemies if they are standing in front of the crucial support beam to a heavy, dangerously unbalanced structure.  83. If I'm eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have to leave the table for any reason, I will order new drinks for both of us instead of trying to decide whether or not to switch with him.  84. I will not have captives of one sex guarded by members of the opposite sex.  85. I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, e.g. "Align the 12 stones of power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse." Instead it will be more alone the lines of "Push the button/"  86. I will make sure that my doomsday device is up to code and properly grounded.  87. My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, I will not construct walkways above them.  88. If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not berate them for incompetence then send the same group out to do the task again.  89. After I capture the hero's super weapon, I will not disband legions and relax my guard because I believe whoever holds the weapon is unstoppable. After all, the hero held the weapon and I took it from him.  90. I will not design my main control room so that every workstation is facing away from the door.  91. I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and obviously agitated until my personal grooming or current entertainment is finished. It might actually be important.  92. If I ever talk to the hero on the phone, I will not taunt him. Instead, I will say that his dogged perseverance has given me new insight on the futility of my evil ways and that if he leaves me alone for a few months of quiet contemplation I will likely return to the path of righteousness. (Heroes are incredibly gullible in this regard.)  93. If I decide to hold a double execution of the hero and the underling who failed or betrayed me, I will die first.  94. When arresting prisoners, my guards will not allow them to stop and grab a useless trinket of purely sentimental value.  95. My dungeon will have its own qualified medical staff complete with bodyguards. That way if a prisoner becomes sick and his cell mate tells the guard it's an emergency, the guard will fetch a trauma team instead of opening the cell for a look.  96. My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the control panel on the outside seals the door and blasting the control panel on the inside opens the door, not vice versa.  97. My dungeon cells will not be furnished with objects that contain reflective surfaces or anything that can be unraveled.  98. If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I will carefully monitor their activities. If I find they are happy and affectionate, I will ignore them. However, if circumstances have forced them together against their will and they spend all their time bickering and criticizing each other except during the intermittent occasions when they are saving each other' lives at which point there are hints of sexual tension, I will immediately order their execution.  99. Any data files of crucial importance will be padded to 1.45Mb.  100. Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I will provide each of them with free, unlimited internet access.

         Ahhh!  WWDC keynote is almost upon us. It is 10 Pacific, 12 Central, so I am going to be driving to Austin when it is going on. I wish there was a radio station that would cover it live. On the other hand, the whole laptop to cell phone connection may bet a whole lot handier on this trip. Unfortunately, I'm not going to have any time on my own, so there is no chance to zip down to Mojo's or some place with a fast connection and download the keynote video.     If any of you Austin guys want to see me being busy, just visit the Dave and Busters near the Arboretum (sic).

       so i just spent the last twenty minutes trying to remember how exactly to share files from an os9 box. i mean, having to go to tcp/ip in the control panels and then changing the permissions on the volume to mount...stuff like that. things have come a long way.  but i did it. 2.09 GB worth of conference images being sucked over to another mac where i'll archive them to cd and copy them over to the new pc they replaced the old mac tower with. a nice easy day, so far.   amber  i had a suspicion that that was what you were doing while we were at diedrich's. i could tell by the smirk on your face that you were up to no good....   adolph & paul  i'm really happy with the progress we made on sunday. i passed along the mtg notes to todd.  also : apparently, carol has some insights into what don really wants. she did mention this to me earlier. we'll have to get together with her to find out what she knows.

       I'm sitting across the table at Deiedrich's looking at Killy as I post this.  See Killy?  I'm actually posting!  The Frio sounds fabulous, Taggart.  I've just been finishing up my college education this summer.  No fun adventures yet, but I'll be done in August.  Thanks for all the wishes of good luck when I was interviewing a couple weeks ago.  I accepted a position with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society a Client Programs Coordinator.  I'll start July 7.  I'm pretty excited about it.  Since I've been interning with them since September I'll be able to get things done as soon as I start.  I'll be working to coordinate self-help groups, educational programs, programs for children with MS, the chapter newsletter, and the chapter website, as well as assisting my boss with planning for camps at Camp for All and social programs.  It should be pretty rewarding.

       I caught a run away dog and returned it to the mother of it's owner.  I chashed my children and growled like a monster.  I ate for breakfast the remainders of a feast from the previous night.  wondered about many things.   saw two shrews in one day, the same day I and my wife watched osprey land in a nest above us.  drew while I thought about implications of a pen line.  saw the newspaper and my head spun from the larger perspective.

         This is a list of questions that i believe we need to get answered as soon as possible. I have emailed this list to Don (carol's boss) so he can start to think about these things. We'll prolly have to assume some of this stuff based on marketing materials that carol will get for us, if he doesn't get back with us soon:     Client Pre-Production Checklist   What is the purpose of the proposed media product(s)? What is the perceived communications problem/challenge?  What is proposed primary media to convey the message(s), why? Describe the collateral media that will form the balance of your integrated marketing strategy/campaign.          Who is the primary audience for the piece (describe as thoroughly as possible?.age, gender, socio-economic status, education, etc.)? Who is the secondary audience, the tertiary audience?  What does each audience (primary, secondary, tertiary) currently know, feel, and believe about the stated problem (address lack of information, misconceptions, and/or misperceptions held at this point in time)?  What do you want each audience (primary, secondary, tertiary) to  know  after being exposed to the finished media product(s)? (address the specific facts to be disseminated)  What do you want each audience (primary, secondary, tertiary) to  believe  after being exposed to the finished media product(s)? (address state of mind after being exposed to the facts)  What do you want each audience (primary, secondary, tertiary) to  feel  after being exposed to the finished media product(s)? (address emotional state after being exposed to the ?story?)  What do you want each audience (primary, secondary, tertiary) to  do  after being exposed to the finished media product(s)? (identify the definitive ?call to action? the audience(s) should take)  Where and how will the media product(s) be used? (address mail vs. use with a presenter? specific events during which the media product(s) will be used? technologies needed for viewing? environmental considerations like noise, light, line of sight? ADA? shelf-life            of product? etc.)  When do you need the media product(s) completed, what is the deadline?         What is your budget, be specific?          Who will be responsible for final approval of the media product(s)? Will s/he/they be an active participant during the on-going creation of the media product(s)?  How will you measure the effectiveness of the media product(s)?  Who will be the technical advisors/subject matter specialists with regard to content? Do they have the authority to act in that capacity, do they have the time to act in that capacity, do they ?buy-into? the project?  Any ideas regarding the creative approach?

       Good to know... since my power-adapter no longer wants to give power to my ibook!     (no nice orangy light for me!   no AC menu-item on the desktop! Battery power....fading.....)    I need to test with killy's adapter to see where the problem is!  What is it about me and this ibook?  Is a month without problems too much to ask?    Should I have bought a Dell?

       Yepper, all iBook (Dual USB) and PB G4 models use the same power interface. (There are some out there that have yo-yo's, like my iBook (Dual USB) 500, but the interface and voltage match. In fact,  Paul , since your power supply has the silver tip, it would match my PB better than my own.

They are from Canada and met each other at some enviromental tree planting work camp. There supposedly was alot of singing and playing around the camp fire. They have a second album called "CHINATOWN"  it is good too. much more polished and produced, but still lovely. over and out.  looking forward to texas.

           It is amazing what people will pick up on. The first time I looked at the page I completely missed it. One of the interesting things to note is 8 gigs of RAM max, this means that they are using the 64 bit IBM 970. For reasons I won't claim to understand, the max allowable by a 32 bit processor in a conventional machine is 4 gigs (and I'm not certain if Mac OS X 10.2 can even see more than 2 gigs).

            hey Killy,  I have been using  urlLink phpicalendar  running off my ibook, and it works great!  I like it because to take a quick peek at my busy calendar I do not need to open up iCal (which takes too long too load), I just switch to a bookmark and my calendar shows up in my browser (a lot faster).  iCal has a neat feature that lets you automagically publish your iCal using webDav.  Setting this up to run on your local machine is no problem because you can easily enable webDav on your machine's webserver, etc.  Getting it to work on a remote server (e.g chairjockey.com) would be dependant on whether that server allows webDav access.  I do not think chairjockey, or wt.net does allow this access.  So your only recourse for updating would be to ftp the iCal file up to the server.  This would require probably too much effort if you update your iCal regularly.  Of course, you could set up a cron job that would ftp your iCal up to the server...

       Lack of tripod.   Absolutley limited my composure.   Mark liked the Tunnel and we spent maybe 15 min in there. I took him to the Rothko chapel afterword and he liked that. He was very interested in the Byzantine Chapel but it did not open till 11 a.m. and that was too late. The Twombly didnt  open till 11 either. Next time we go down to Houston he is going to check it out.

        tag  I was looking at the two photos you posted. Good thinking to put the cam on the ground for such a long exposure i would guess (which is prolly why mark's is so fuzzy), and i appreciate the off centered-ness; but i would have really loved to have seen a straight on shot with marks reflection framed by the fuzzy reflection of the blue lights. that would have been a shot you could take home to mama.

           While not much as pleasure craft go, the Grumman Challenger (circa 1985) is a serviceable photographic platform.  not really, but paul decided it was. so bright and early this morning we loaded up and shoved off in  to bucolic lake austin right at the 360 bridge.  after some aimless cruising we ended up spotting our quarry. it's a lovely cape cod style home with nautical overtones, and lake access. it's currently being offered for more money than you can think of without getting a headache. perfect for a 'getaway' home.  mission accomplished, paul decided some fishing was in order. then some more aimless cruising, finally, back to shore and the office.

       Hey  Paul ,  Yeah, MovableType is used by most "serious" bloggers. Aparently there are a lot of different ways to customize it and add plug-ins.  On the other hand, you could just throw  urlLink Bloxsom  on chairjockey and make a form that makes a bunch of text files...

          I finally got  urlLink MovableType  up and running on my ibook!  I want to try this blog server out because I am very interested in blogging and  urlLink moblogging , and from what I have read MovableType is pretty comphrehensive as far as features.  Also, it supports most of the Blogger XML-RPC API, and most of the metaWebLog XML-RPC API, which means it will be useful as test platform for my next project...     Warning!  Post gets boring!      I had a tough time getting Movable Type working properly because I tried to configure it to use  mysql  support.  It turned out that my perl install does not include the DBD::mysql  module, and for unknown reasons CPAN was unable to install it.  I suspect that the problem has something to do with the fact that my mysql install is located in /Library/Mysql instead of a more usual place like /usr/local, and so during the build process the Linker had hard time finding the proper header files and libraries.  I even tried to build the module manually, but every attempt to proplerly link the required object files failed, so i am now running this thing w/out db support....  And it works great!  This thing offers so much more than the free version of  urlLink blogger , which is to be suspected I guess.  What I really like is that you can add  comments  to posts.    Anyhow, I am thinking that maybe we could get this thing up and running on  urlLink chairjockey.com  and eventually transition ourselves to a full-service blog...

         One of my current projects is updating a simple web application that manages rider information and prize fulfillment. When entering the fulfillment of a prize, one of the challenges is to collect the necessary information about that fulfillment. For example, when we issue out a jersey, we need to keep track of who it went to, what size it was, the status that it is fulfilled and not back-ordered and potentially a comment field in case a friend picked it up. And so on:      Watch: Person, Men's or Women's Watch, Status, Comment   Polo Shirt: Person, M or W, Size, Status, Comment   Gift Certificate: Person, Amount, Serial Number, Status, Comment     To keep the programming simple, you just make a form that has slots for each of the above and display it to the user. They fill in the relevant parts and ignore the rest. However, the actual usage of the software is often in low-light situations with a volunteer who isn't familiar with the computer and certainly isn't rememberful of what prize requires what information.    The unhelpful programmer solution to user's miskeying information in such a situation is to make certain fields mandatory, like with a javascript that pops up an error message. The better way (I think) is to only present form options relevant to the choice at hand. How do I do this?   The problem is twofold. First, it is keeping track of each product's fields: what shouldn't be displayed; what is mandatory or optional; what is the default value (if any) and what are the choices; what kind of data should be accepted? Second, how does the application control the user's access to each field? Does it use DHTML to change the form when a user selects a specific product or is product fulfillment handled in two steps/screens (1.) select the product, (2.) input that products fields?

          urlLink Keyspan : ZIP-LINQ USB Cell Phone Charger Cable - Ericsson  I ordered one of these late last week. It arrived today. It works pretty well. Basically, the zip thing is a regular USB cable. The kit comes with a USB to Ericsson phone power adapter. That way I don't have to bring along the cell charger when I'm on the road. In some ways, this is a pointless accessory because a phone charge lasts three to four days. Trips lasting longer than that typically require a hotel with powersource, etc. However, whenever I run Bluetooth on the phone, the battery lasts for a day or a day and a half. With this smaller than charger gizmo in my bag, I can keep the phone topped off and keep Bluetooth on all the time. For me, that's the cool part.

        urlLink HoustonChronicle.com - Continental to charge $50 for paper tickets   My boss passed the dead tree version of this article to me and these are some of my thoughts:     Summary of Continental Article:     Continental increasing fee on traditional ticketing.  Increased fees reflect higher cost of traditional ticketing.  97% of passengers use electronic ticketing now over 82% last year.  Next year Contintental will discontinue traditional ticketing.  Electronic ticketing costs far less experts say.  Managing director for electronic marketing says 1/3 less.  Continental has cut distribution costs by 20%.  2003 website sales 70% higher than 2002, expected to pass $1 billion.  Continental incentivizes online ticket sales with more frequent flier miles and special one-day sales.  Internet sales, electronic ticketing and self-serve kiosks offer speed and efficiency benefits.  Move away from paper tickets will decrease labor, material and storage costs associated with printing.     My Narrative:     This article gives a broad overview of Continental's electronic ticketing and internet marketing strategy. It does not describe how electronic ticketing is significantly different from traditional ticketing. Internet promotions and electronic ticketing may seem in general to be related, but are in fact two highly different efforts.     Is the move toward electronic ticketing and the changes in customer service worth the investment in kiosks and infrastructure? The article doesn't say how quickly the costs are being recouped. Is the move toward direct marketing from the airline to the consumer via the Internet good business? The article doesn't say; it doesn't look at how much new business is being generated by the website over canibalization of traditional formats of sale.     The ticket concept was developed as a distributed knowledge system where the ticket, token or chit represented a reserved space on a particular flight. Back when airports were not linked to "enterprise databases" this was necessary, since the gate keepers couldn't just "look you up." The current paradigm is a networked knowledge system where your identiity has a (potentially) reserved space on a particular flight. Instead of producing a ticket, you verify your identity. Thus tickets have been going the way of the dodo for a while now.    The interesting part is that it has taken so long for the ticket to go away. The reason for this probably has more to do with human factors than technical factors. People are used to having some sort of ticket to board the airplane. An airline that doesn't fit within that norm is somehow "wierd," like Southwest.

I had this idea in my head that when I moved to NYC all the radio stations would suddenly be so much better and more sophisticated or cutting edge or something but I've found it's all the same sh*t, really .. obnoxious deejays, car advertisements, morning programs about people who suspect other people of cheating on them, some 70s disco (yeah!) and just when you get into a groove then they switch to 50s surf music, but thank god, there's still NPR to listen to wherever you go.

       Hi  urlLink  Killy  ,   urlLink Sendmail  is a common computer program that sends and recieves email. Sendmail is not like the email program you use on your computer, though. Sendmail is designed to be the application your Internet Service Provider runs and your email program connects to Sendmail to pick up email and to send out email.

       Does responding in 'colin terms' mean I have to say stuff like  "hella ?"  e.g.  sendmail is hella cool but hella difficult to configure piece of software used to  send electronic mail .?   With it you could send email  directly from your machine  instead of having to route it through  your isp's  mail server (which is prolly running sendmail too).    This is probably not too useful for users like you and me and the rest of us.  But if you ever get nerdy and decide that you want to be able send email between your pink and blue imacs, and your powerbook   without having to be connected to the internet , enabling sendmail on your machine would be the way to do it...

       Hey guys,  Has anybody put a php template file in database? As part of a current project I would like to put a mostly html template file in the db, and then call it and fill it with preset variables. This is pretty easy to do with include(). When I echo out the template from the db, it just echos it and doesn't parse for variables to fill, regardless if I do it the short way $stories or the long way  .  Any thoughts?   Oh, and I am looking at  urlLink Smarty , but didn't want to use it on this quick project.

       ...but why am I awake at 2:30 morning on a sunday/monday morning, posting this?  Well, its cause Dave and I just got back from  urlLink Kollective Fusion's  first gallery show.    The show was held in the upstairs of a building down on 6th street...a nice space all lit up good...a DJ spinning, free drinks and  people dancing .    It turns out that Kollective Fusion is made up of a couple of Austin designer's and artists, one of whom is Stephen ?, a fella that Colin and I played ball with back at SWT.  His stuff was pretty tight- the stuff I like the most were promo posters he had done and framed, including one for a  urlLink Jurassic 5  show last year.  Anyhow, I had brought my camera with the idea that I would take some fotos of stuff to blog about later...but Dave had other ideas...and soon I was taking pictures of him and various of the fine and beautifuls.  The gallery show ended at 10 and the after-party started up down the street at a place called 419 West (actually on 4th street).  A jazz-a-billy band played some music and then a DJ started spinning and some folks even got up all freestyle which sounded pretty good...  I had a good time listening to the music and watching people be what I am not, and Dave had good time talking with the lovelies....

       Well lets see, what order do I put things in?    Have been working pretty steady on freelance projects, got a possible job offer from Nike when I was in Texas. Got a call from the Head of Apparel graphics at Adidas yesterday and have a meeting with him on monday about a job possibility.    It would be great to have it work out at Adidas, for it is up in my part of town. The last time I went by there to do some self promotion, I rode my skateboard from the house.   It is all a bit unsetteling, having possibilities of a solid paycheck d-dangeled in front of you, so many times since I have been up here have people toyed with the offer - got me to salivate and do tricks - and then it all crumbles. I don't want to get my hopes up to high, but then again - fuck it - thats what the joy of hopes are.  listened to some recordings of Joseph Cambell talking of the power of myths as we drove to a satelite town where there is a farm that sells organic berries, Laura snd the girls are going to make and can jelly today.  end of line.

        So I just had a  second  interview with the folks from the  mysterious non-profit .  This time, instead of taking place in a caf in Hyde Park, the interview was the at the Austin Ventures offices on the 23rd floor of the some big-ass building downtown.    Also, instead of facing just the executive-director, I had to square off with one of the board-members (a venture capitalist and frequent yawner), and a really nice 'technical-advisor.'    Anyhow they pelted me with all sorts of questions like "So, it says here on your resum that you invented the  World Wide Web...How do you think this experience prepares you for the brutal, ego-ridden, money-driven world of Film?"  I answered all of their questions with the a labryinth of non-sequiturs that would have made the great  urlLink Ari Fleischer  proud....  So, now I fear that they will offer me the job and I will actually have to make a decision...

       Today i took an old video tape of Dr. K's of Laryngeal Cancer and transferred it to DV and then took it into Premiere. In between conferences tomorrow i've got to cut out all the superfluous title pages and slice the movie into six different movies to be placed into a power point talk he's giving.     it's crazy looking stuff. now i know what a normal larynx and a cancerous larynx look like. I'll update this post tomorrow when i get a still. (any votes for normal or cancerous? or should i put both?)  I also got yet another poster to construct. This time it's about  urlLink JHACO , an organization that kinda watchdogs hospitals. The poster is supposed to reflect the processes were implementing to please organizations like them.  Today we also met with an Ilford rep who brought us a 30 ft roll of satin quick-dry paper for the plotter. It's nice stuff. i printed a poster on it for comparison. It's slightly heavier and has a subtle texture to the paper. I like it better than what we're currently using.  So i'm busy at work. Busy as a bee, and i still find time to chat with my good buddy paul.

       I'm spotting Elements at every corner it seems; in all different colors: burnt orange (i've seen several of those), blue (today's spotting). Carol doesn't like them; she thinks they're just ugly. I'm indifferent, but i am becoming more curious about their appeal to so many people (people here, at least.)     I've discovered an advantage to living here: the checkout girls/guys at the grocery stores are super fast. For real.  Today, the baby and i walked and talked with each other. He would point his hands out to the trees and streetlamps, and say, "...ah..." kinda short and abrupt with a surprised tone in his voice. There are mini magnolia trees everywhere here. He likes to touch the leaves on those trees.  We also met aliya, the black retriever.  If i leave work after five fifteen, i might as well leave at six. I go home straight down main. It isn't so bad (once you leave the med center) till you get past Hiram Clarke and have to sit at the light at south post oak; then, chimney rock; then, hillcroft; then, fondren; then, independence; then, the two unnecessary lights in stafford; then, the turn at 'e' street; then, the light to get onto 1092; then, the light at lexington; and the neighborhood lights and stop signs; then, the light to cross highway 6; and finally to two remaining stop signs to go to my place.

Liz, No, Brooke is really kind of normal -- I think she was around 5'6" and she looked sort of, well, ordinary, in a boat hat with jeans -- but, I was thrilled to be the next person to sit on the toilet after her!  I'll never wash my ass cheeks again ...   Colin, Anthony keeps asking when are you gonna call him to talk shop (??)  Liz, what's your e-mail?  I'll send the longer version of that essay ..

       It's so wierd to see Adolph office-izing...it really reminds me of my old office job, except Adolph's job is cooler, and he likes it! Adolph is such a stylin' office dresser I might add! Well, I REALLY can't wait to hear some Diana stories about PA school, but you'll just have to hear nursing school stories until then. Well, carolina, my pt. this week had mastitis....an infected breast....from breast feeding a 10lb baby! So that means baby planning for me has been postponed until next lifetime! I have tons more to tell, but I really don't think they're appropriate for the blog.  I decided that just going to school and being a lazy student isn't enough for me, so I applied to a frivolous job at Banana Republic. 60% discount, that's better than health benefits! If that doesn't work out, I'm going for the Central Market gig, that would be so cool to work with Madeline-does she still work there?  Taggart and I are going to the Bahamas next week...I am pretty clueless about the whole trip because Taggart's mother gave it to us. I think of it as an adventure. Good luck with the job hunting Paul...I'd love it if you and Eleo lived in Austin. Please tell her I said hi.  Amber in NYC-loved your blog about wavelenths and frequencies and stuff...once you become aware of such patterns, it's overwhelming how they apply to everything everywhere, in every situation. The whole yin/yang...everything trying to come into balance. i love it. I'd love to read your paper when you complete it!

        Hey  Paul ,  the mention of a  urlLink new release of Hydra  in  urlLink Macintouch  today made me think: man I wish I could have had your eyes looking at what I was doing last night. I was at Deitricks on Westheimer, so I was at a connection. I finally figured out my dumb error but it probably would have been quicker if someone outside of what I was doing could look at it.    I think I want something with the IDE-ness of Project Builder, the text-editing mojo of BBEdit, and the sharability of Hydra. Maybe one day Bare Bones will get smart and license the Rendezvous sharing code from Hydra and  urlLink X-Code  will allow other text editors to be built in.       Adolph , I think you have such a good eye for things.  A Hydra-cized BBEdit would be sweet...

       You know, I never did get around to finishing the epic email detailing my trip up north. It had a bunch about Amber and Anthony and visiting Anthony's gallery show. What is really amazing from the perspective of a computer-centric person is that Anthony's art isn't computer driven. When I looked at some of it, the detail, the [whatever that French word that means real-looking], made it look like it was scans and pastes and so forth. Not so. Everything was painstakingly hand made. Afterwards we went out to a restaurant where we discussed the intrinsic values in original art and Amber saw Brook Sheilds in the bathroom.

         carol, et al:       When I made a remark to Kilito about his upcoming birthday I specifically remember him saying that one of the things he really, really wanted at his birthday was  a large bucket of fried-chicken .  He also said that he wanted plenty of buttery-biscuits.  I also seem to recall that he said something about  Root Beer Floats .  I'm not sure about the Root Beer Floats, that could be me projecting my own wishes on my memory, but I am  positiive  about the fried chicken.

         so, the power group mark bruce hooked me up with is interested in creating a 'collaborative environment for efficient commenting on the development process' accoridng to paul, the president. i figured a forum style thing would do the trick.  first i found  urlLink this free php forum software . i looked at it, downloaded it, and promptly forgot about it.  well, when i was poking around the adi.com control panel (mostly to discover what our users are browsing with) i saw a bulletin board icon.  lo and behold, it was the same stuff, already installed, configured, the works. i just had to 'flip the switch' and it was running.  so, do me a favor ::  go  urlLink here  and play around a bit.

       the suitcase info worked fine. thanks. as for the game, that makes me feel better that i wasn't just kicking you while you were down. so much for choosing the mongols, but they ARE supposed to be better hunters than other civ's.  better than the chinese, at least.   urlLink i've fixed the map a little . it's the same basic thing, but without the monkey boys and iron boars killing everyone is sight. i've also removed most of the walls and put a few more trees up to block certain paths. pick it up, test it out, and tell me if you like it.

        to be fair  killy , i was running for cover and building up in a different area when my castle went down, not distracted by diana. my shit was scattered, my crack troops were actually crack heads, and their leader fatally disorganized.  additionally, i need to learn more about the civilizations i choose. the mongols can't build farms or markets until the castle age, so food was a limiting factor in growth.  btw, i sent the info you requested to your wt.net address. let me know if it works.

        Todd:  Can you please drop me the info for Suitcase that we talked about this weekend? Thanks.  So last night adolph, todd, and i played a game of aoe on that custom map (that NEEDS to be fixed). Adolph's villagers were killed by a rampaging boar (said boar is also a suspect in the untimely destruction of his town center as well.) Todd and I paid tributes to adolph, hoping he could manage to pick himself up. He used the dough we sent him to build an army. Unfortunately, he got caught in the crossfire of two of my castles. Adolph was doomed.  Before Todd got a call from Diana (how is she by the way?) we had a fairly good time duking it out with archers. We had a couple of good battles, but then he just stopped. He never told me he got a phone call, so his castle had to go...and then, his town center as well...and then all his houses....towers, and other miscellaneous bldgs....  he came back at the end of the carnage to an empty burnt out hometown.  Paul, you should have been there.  I'm going to try and fix this map though, i'm going to fix all the walls. take out the monkey boys and the boars. and reposition some of the trees so it's more difficult to just walk into someones 'area'. Any other suggestions?

        I am posting from the "Flight Path" caf in Austin.  I just got done with an interview with a  mysterious non-profit .  It went really well.  I am definitely going to have a second interview next week to meet some of the "board members."    The position is pretty much exactly what I am looking for: a tech-person to solve their tech issues- including the mgmt of 12 node LAN of Macs running OS X.    Beyond these light network admin responsibilities they are involved in a heavy data integration project, and struggling to get sensible, and accessible views into their data...  I am really excited about this one.  I think it could be the beginning of something really interesting...for all of us.  that is all.

       We got up this morning at 8; that is to say, adolfo got up at 8 and mom and dad dutifully followed his energetic lead. He wakes up smiling, babbling, and going back and forth between mom and dad. He slaps us on our backs to wake us up, he sits inbetween us and babbles. If he happens to find a book in the bed that we read to him the night before, he picks that up and starts to read (chew) on it.  So we were awake.  We pulled on some shorts and gave the baby a quick breakfast of banana and oj (mixed with 1/2 water), and went jogging. My mother went to Taquitos and picked up tacos for everyone. By the time we got back, my mother had a bag full of tacos: barbacoa, potato and egg, bean and bacon, chorizo...she's a woman driven by grease. I love her.  So we ate and was happy. Did i mention the coffee?

        how do you feel, paul? and remember, this is for posterity so...be honest.   the suburbs may kill me, but it's a risk i'm willing to take for now. I'm trying to make the best of the situation that i'm in (put myself in?). Life at my mom's house is good. Her internal clock, which she's been operating on for years now, wakes her up at 4 a.m. She puts coffee on every morning, so i've had one every morning this week. that's nice. i've also had the pleasure of being taught all there is to know about washing clothes so they get 'clean'.  remember clean? i mean, REALLY clean. MOM CLEAN? well, it's 24/7 these days. I'm clean as a whistle. the stains i never thought would go away are gone.  we haven't had a chance to hit the parks for walks yet, but i'm looking forward to that. there is a nice bike/walking trail just down the street and a park to go with it with big soccer fields. once my weekends free themselves up i may check for pickup games.  speaking of pickup games: sorry i won't be able to make it to san antonio this weekend, colin. i wish i had the time, but i just don't. i'm so sorry. i was really hoping that you were going to be able to make it to houston and check out museums and stuff. there's always next week, i guess. maybe you can make a getaway sunday.  life here in the burbs isn't all that bad. i don't get to see adolph too often, and the drive is longer than i really want it to be, but i can deal with that for now. luckily i've gone to empire/brazil/diedrich's/chicken & eggroll/nikos/la mexicana/tapatia enough times to not need to go there so often anymore.

       And the display 1.8 is pretty sweet. The guy popped it open--the latch system is so smooth its architectural. Everything about it (other than being kind of big) is very very nice. Nothing cheesy about it at all. I was a fan of the Yosimite G3-G4 towers with the latch and the handles and the space for lots of internal drives and whatnot. At the same time, they're kinda toylike compared to the G5.

       Something I've been thinking about recently is how to organize myself. Organizing oneself is one of those ackward periods in life, similar to adolescence, filled with missteps, discoveries, ... One of my discoveries is that time periods themselves are essentially cyclical, but calendars are typically represented linearly.   This in part has been due to limitations in how we work with the data. From a design standpoint, it was simpler to put a calendar on a page as a grid. However, when I try to look out on my work calendar, it spans a year. It's new year is about now and the limitations of the printed calendar prevent a good visualization of how I am going to approach larger projects. Contemporary computer calendar software seems to follow this model (Outlook, iCal do at least).  What I want is a  urlLink Year Wheel . I think it would be really cool to take the php glue to iCal calendar data and put it into a flexible flash interface that presents a year cyclically, rather than linearly.

        i am so excited. it's 8:14 am. in about seven hours i'll be boarding a plane bound for the great northwest, and the sweetest girl i know. while i have some nagging concerns (the welfare of my plants, confused/irate clients) i am absolutely vibrating with anticipation.  i feel like a six year old before christmas.   i would like to take this opportunity to wish killito a wonderful birthday, with many, many happy returns. speaking of returns, i am currently planning on taking a taxi home from the airport on sunday the 31st. i figured everyone would be out celebrating labor and generally unavailable.

        The usability problem wasn&#146;t anything wrong with Flash intrinsically, it&#146;s just that we couldn&#146;t get it to feel enough like being in a browser. It was really, really hard to get the Back button working properly, and even things like letting people type in a query and launch it by pressing Enter (as apposed to clicking on a button) were a challenge.  This is pretty interesting. I'm starting to work on a new interface for the Packet Pickup Application and was thinking about implementing it in Flash rather than html or dhtml.

       You know  Paul , There are plenty of other kinds of fowl. I'd think I'd prefer turkey or duck any day of the week. Chickens have been a remarkable domesticated bird though. I wonder what other categories of animal missed out on domestication. We have Equines, Bovines, Fowl, Sheep and Goats, ...?

Before the summer is over we should hit the comal or the san marcos river.  School starts in one week-back to "old naked lady bathing" and another atempt at catheterization. "hello nurse!"

       Thanks for reminding me. I'm uploading them this afternoon and Amber and I are set to do some captioning this evening. We shot a little over 250 frames and Amber took 4 camera movies. One of the "lessons learned" at weeks end was to make sure your camera's timestamps are synchronized. If you don't do that, you can't just sort by time, you have to manually sort everything.

        From urlLink http://www.robgalbraith.com/   urlLink the Nikon D2H  sounds cool:    In addition, the Ambience Light Sensor (shown at left)is able to detect the flicker of artificial lights such as fluorescent, mercury vapour and the like. The flicker is really a strong shift in the colour being emitted by the light source during each on/off cycle (there are usually 50-60 such cycles each second).     As it has been explained to us, once flicker has been detected, the AWB system compensates by applying a different balance frame-by-frameas needed to counteract the per-cycle colour shift. Egads, if this works it could be of tremendous benefit to sports shooters in particular, since the colour shift really only becomes nasty at action-stopping shutter speeds (1/60 is typically the threshold; above that you'll increasingly experience the problem).

       Hi -- I love this photo of the blackened skyline.  The power came on again most places by 5 a.m. this morning, but the subways and trains will not be running again until tonight, so no one could commute to work, really, which is why we got a "snow day"!  I tried calling you, Carol, a little while after it happened but the cell phone lines were jammed -- I called you at work and heard you say hello, I said hello twice and then the line went dead. -A

       SNOW DAY IN AUGUST  Its not very often that one gets a snow day in August, but today it was virtually impossible for most New Yorkers to get to work, making it the largest snow day, or power blackout in U.S. history.    Where were you when it happened?  That is the topic of everyones conversation on the streets throughout the city.  It was 4:10 p.m. and I was getting a signature from someone verifying that his plants had been taken care of for the day.  He looked out at the digital clock at Penn Station to get the time so he could make a note of what time I had been there.    Damn clocks out, he said.  Just then, someone yelled down that the power had gone out in the building.  Must be something going on at Penn Station, he said.  Probably another bomb scare.  I started walking toward the office when I noticed people were suddenly spilling out of all the office buildings nearby.  People were frantically waving down taxis.  Powers out all over the city, I heard someone say.  A cop was standing on the corner of 34th and Seventh Ave. busily fielding questions from passersby.  I asked him if the subways were still running.  Yeah, they have their own generators, so service shouldnt be affected, he said.    I walked over to the A-C-E subway entrance and looked down the stairs.  It was all dark down there and I could here a Metro Transit worker on the intercom below, Everyone stay perfectly still!  No one move!!  Were going to get you all out of here as soon as we can, but everyone has to be quiet and stop moving!  Bad idea, I decided, and began to scan around for taxis.  A few of them were still empty, but they were filling up fast.  Then I noticed the traffic was coming to a standstill.  Suddenly, I realized there were 9 million other people on the sidewalks with me and we were all trying to get out of Manhattan!    Ill get there faster walking, I thought, and started to steer myself in a northeasterly direction.  I walked 25 blocks north and seven avenues east, passing by Times Square, Grand Central, and Bloomingdales on my way to the 59th Street bridge.  People were very calm, almost too calm, I thought, considering this looks eerily like September 11 all over again.  Still, it was a blessing to be surrounded by so much level-headedness in a situation where mob mentality could have easily ruled the day.  Lots of people simply congregated outside of their office buildings, talking and smoking as though waiting for the power to come back on any minute.  Not me, I thought, the last place I want to be right now is Manhattan, and kept walking.  Manhattan may be the only city in the U.S. where there are more pedestrians and mass-transit users than there are automobiles, a fact that quickly became evident as the amount of people on the sidewalks surged and overflowed onto the streets, taking up entire lanes of traffic with their thronging multitudes  the huddled masses yearning to be free.  People were in good spirits, smiling, even cracking jokes, stopping to buy ice cream from the traveling ice cream van (in times of crisis, business can be very good for a few  ice cream vendors were particularly fortunate on this 94 degree August day without air-conditioning).   As I approached the 59th Street bridge, I was quickly enveloped in such a mass of people as I had never seen before.  I had caught glimpses of this sort of mass gathering at a few rock concerts, but this stretched the entire length of the 59th Street bridge, from Manhattan to Queens, on both the upper and lower levels.  Were packed in like sardines, someone said good-naturedly.  Great, I thought, just where I want to be, suspended 100 feet above the churning waters of the East River with hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of cars packed in as tight as they could be.  It looked sturdy though, no swaying beams or shuddering wires, so on we went.  Again, the swarms of people outnumbered the cars, shutting down two of the four lanes of traffic on the bridge after they had completely filled up the pedestrian crossing area and overflowed into and between lanes of traffic.  The cars were moving much slower than the people at that point.  The people in their cars obliged us all by turning up their car radios to the news stations, so we could hear snippets of information on the long walk home.  All of New York is without power and parts of New Jersey, Connecticut, Michigan, and Canada.  The mayor says it is not terrorism.  People are stuck on subways all over the city, including tunnels underneath the East River.  Teams of Metro Transit authorities are working together to get everyone out in the pitch dark conditions.  Two hours later, I had made it across the bridge and up Northern Boulevard to our apartment in Astoria, Queens.  Anthony hopped around excitedly, showing me the battery-powered light globes he had set around the apartment to keep things well lit throughout the night.  We listened to a battery-powered radio, each of us connected to an ear-plug, off and on for several hours.    Later, after dusk had fallen, we climbed up to the roof of our apartment.  For the first time ever, we could see stars lit up over New York City.  Theres the Big Dipper! Anthony said, Ive never in my life seen the Big Dipper before in the city.  We could also see the Manhattan skyline, for once dark and silent as obelisks against the lighter blue-black of the night sky.  Only the U.N. had lights on, backed by their own internal generators.  The Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were completely dark and strange looking.  A few red air traffic lights blinked red on the roofs of some of the skyscrapers.  Everything else was quiet and calm.  And for one night, the first in nearly a century, the city slept.

         So I was really happy to have seen my little brother up in Austin the other night.  As I mentioned in a previous post he came into to town with the San Diego band  urlLink Album Leaf  .  He was the manager for the month long tour that took the band as far as Chicago and Atlanta.  By the time they got to Austin they were pretty worn out, but still had eneogh energy to put on a good show...   So, as usual I came away from the visit full of love and music.  My brother also hooked me up with some of his new stuff....which I encourage you to check out  urlLink  here .  This  urlLink  track  is an older song of his....

       so i did it all wrong, but i did it.  flipping movies 180 degrees with premiere was easy once i found the palette to do it, but it wouldn't export flipped. i was rendering the workspace and then i was trying to export. the resulting file was always right side up. It was totally frustrating.  Paul suggested that i get up and walk away; that i was overlooking something totally obvious. maybe.  so i stopped working on it at 3:30 and moved to getting a poster printed instead. I left for the day and ended up playing with adolfo iv most of the evening. We had chili dogs for dinner. Carol piled hers high with tomatoes, onions, cheese, and chili; while i had mine with a good slathering of mustard.  The baby fell asleep and we both stayed up watching 'third rock' (the funniest sit-com re-run ever).  My body demanded that sleep an extra hour and a half today, so i did. Once i got to work, i returned to the video flipping project. I waded throught my hierarchy (sp?) loooking for my file and i noticed a temp folder had been created where there hadn't been one before. Had i missed something?  In that folder were all the 'rendered' movies i had made! they all had fienames that resembled: jlsju0003002010030409lalk.avi. Once i figured out which were which, i just renamed them, took them back into premiere, and exported them so the file sizes were a little smaller. Perfect!

       At first, I actually had to touch a computer in order to cause it to malfunction/break -e.g my ibook.  Then, merely being in the room with it seemed to the trick, e.g. killy's blue imac.   After recieving the following email, I now realize that I am able to destroy even remote machines.   It seems my evil-voodo works over tcp/ip...  I mean, I have only been set up at Verve for 5 days and boom my particular server goes up in smoke.      To: paulmercado@yahoo.com Subject: Emergency Server Maintainence From: Administrator    Earlier this evening the cpu on mackinac.vervehosting.com overheated, causing the server to shut down.

       Forget about it. Tacos???? Sorry man but Tacos you can get anywhere? There is a ceiling on Taco Greatness right? However the French Toast at Truco 7 is something I dream about almost everymorning. So are thier Enchalada Moles. There is also a restaurant right around the corner from Casa Kloster( if you are facing the Kloster it is to your right and up the stairs....they have an awsome nopalito salad. Yogurt con fruta at El Cafe (next to Teatro Juarez) and some coffee is also bueno. The quesadias in the Square with the Huge Shapley Trees are pretty good too. Damn I wish I would have gone there instead of the STINKING BAHAMAS!!!!!!! Enjoy!!!! LOVE The Sorensens

It would be nice to take a few days off and leave 'the boy' with grandma.  MAKE SURE YOU DROP IN ON NINI, THE NICEST LADY YOU'LL EVER MEET! I'LL TRY TO GET YOU HER ADDRESSS IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY.  If you make it to the Calle de los Besos (name???) they kids will stop you and try to tell you the whole story behind the name of the street. don't bother listening, it takes too long, it's all in spanish (most likely), and they just want money for telling you a story. Might sound kinda cute on paper, but it's just plain annoying when you're there.  buy tacos adolph. tacos, tacos, tacos...

       We got here yesterday and everything is really great. (Delayed a day as "volunteers" for the airline for which we were each recompensed with a ticket voucher and a night at the charming airport Holiday Inn (with a leaky air conditioning and an immense (sic) bed) and used the extra day to buy socks and underwear and drop the PB off at the Apple store for the clicker yet again) Staying at Casa Bertha. Taxi from airport directly to Gto was pretty cheap and very fast. No travel hassles. Immagracion did spot the banana and two apples Amber was trying to import into Mexico "No, no," the guy said. He missed Adolphs snicker bar. Casa Bertha has a fantastic roof-top terrace facing Pipilo and overlooking the Teatro Juarez et all. The internet cafe were at loves heavy metal, it is the one on Alonzo near Casa Kloster.   More and pics later.  --Adolph and Amber

         So Dave and I went up to the  urlLink gallery lombardi  last night to check out the  Erotica  art show.   There was a pretty good turnout (I suspect it had something to do with all of the pictures of naked men and women on the wall) and people seemed to be really enjoying themselves, despite some of the live music.    Some of the art-work was pretty good.  There was a wide range of style and media-from video to colloge, to photography, to drawring and oil-painting.  There was even some 'new media' stuff by our buddy  urlLink Dean Nixon .

       OK So I had a dream  In my dream  we were all fiending about this game that is a cross between chess and AOE  some board game  anyway  Adolph had this great idea about holding a game on a bridge that was under construction on the outskirts of town  well Killy and I carried out the plan  we somehow managed to get a hold of tuxedos for everyone and these pass card id tags that we had to wear around our neck with lanyards  so we got these things and using them we each managed to get a hold of a black four door full sized sedan car  one for each of us We used these cars to drive out to the bridge  the bridge was really cool  the entire thing was broken up into huge sections about a half a block long  each section was suspended in the air by a giant crane  the pieces were suspended over a big river at the edge of town and this was the ideal place to have a game So Todd was ultra-paranoid that someone would catch us  Adolphs suit was wrinkled  everyone else was setting up the game when Todd saw the trackers at the same moment they saw us There they are! they pointed at us and started running towards us to get us  we had the upper hand  not only did we have these really cool tuxedos and id tag lanyards  we had these super cool remote control super cars  since a car couldnt simply drive on the bridge  remember  it was still under construction and suspended in pieces over the river  we used a really narrow bridge that resembled a catwalk that ran parallel to the big bridge to drive to the center of it  so now  we were on the run  the cars were in remote control and started driving forward  the narrow bridge was wide enough to hold the width of one car with the doors closed  so we all had to run forward following our remote control cars toward the other side where the road opened in order for us to open the doors to get in it was really exciting  the bridge swaying  these crazy men in black suits chasing us in our tuxedos  we running and jumping over the gaps between the bridge chunks  a very cool action adventure dream I was amazed at Adolphs speed

       There's an island at the easternmost tip of Long Island, where the southern and northern forks split off from one another, about 3 hours away from the city, called Shelter Island.  The only way to get there is by ferry and as you approach the island, it is the epitome of picturesque east coast loveliness:  sailboats on the horizon, a breeze blowing in the air, a great swathe of green ahead on the island itself, as your eyes scan the water in hopes of catching a glimpse of seals as they migrate here sometimes.  Some more reflections:  The sky was full of jellyfish clouds, The sea was golden hay. We lost our way on winding roads That swam like fish away And gleamed silver in the light Hoping not to be found again In the cool freedom of water Where all motion and sound Muffles and fades and here at last you escape yourself so you can find yourself in the shade of Shelter Island.

       This weekend we went inside the apt for the final time. Carol had remembered that our electric drill was in one of the drawers (along with a roll of foil, plastic wrap, and a box of sandwich bags). We figured we would get it when we picked up the car (something i've been dreading to do.)  We woke up WAY too early this morning. The baby was poking at my face and saying "da" at about 6:15. He grabbed at my nose and scratched me, so i put him off the bed. After a few seconds of standing against the side of the bed, he crawled towards the door, opened it and crawled out into the hallway, where my mother quickly picked him up and wisked him off to the living room. I slept for another fifteen minutes before i woke up.  Coffee was already made. Carol woke up and made french toast and eggs (heart shaped - i should have taken a picture). It was delicious. We put the baby in the stroller and took a walk around the neighborhood. It was warm yet pleasant, but only because i know how hot it's going to get in the afternoon.     The sidewalks here are nice: smooth and long. The trees that line the majority of the streets here are hardly old enough for their roots to have developed a taste for sidewalk concrete. They provide a patchy shade as we walk between them.     I don't kow what kinds of trees these are. It is as if they are peeling their skin off, revealing a dark orange inside. Many have big knots from where a branch has been torn off, from one of the many prunings these trees get. My mother, on a previous walk, had mentioned that that was one of the reasons why she loved this neighborhood: they kept up with the trees.  On our way back we passed through a long gap that runs immediately behind the houses that my mother's house faces. In this gap there is a wide white sidewalk and, posted alongside it are massive electricity poles. I would imagine that if you stood out there in the evening (or even on a quiet sunday morning) you might be able to hear the crackly hum of electricity flowing through the wires they support.     We got home and immediately went to the apartment for the car and other misc. things we had forgotten. The car sounded horrible at startup, but made the trip fine. I had all sorts of fantasies on my way to sugarland about changing out the fuel filter and the oxygen sensor; about getting the engine and muffler replaced; about getting the god-awful smell out of that car; about getting its up-to-date inspection and registration; so that i can get back on the road with MY car. The car i paid for. The car i used to drive my baby son home from the hospital. The first car i bought with my wife. The car i owned when Dezma was born.  It was caked with dirt. I hadn't touched it since we bought the Honda (february?) I detailed both cars this afternoon. It was hot - africa hot - iraq hot - fire in my pants hot -  ...and we never got to watch the movies we rented.

       i am putting the finishing touches on the JCAHO poster today, as well as waiting for Dr. N to pay me a visit. He's got a (really really really) cool surgery video that i've got to slice up for him to put into power point.  Also, on chapter 4 (or 5 - can't remember) of the photoshop master class book i've been working on. On page 75 of the Walker Evans biography, and i'm taking one last walk through the apt today. we've got to get all the miscellaneous stuff out before the weekend.  saturday is a yard sale at my mom's house, along with a mini bbq for whoever manages to get up down here. If it's just me and the kid and the wife, though, that would be fine too.  saw adaptation last night. loved it.

Funny, not ten minutes after i read adolph's post my boss comes into my office and tells me that they no longer need the files that were 'lost' on the mac; they had been found on a cd.  So....  the old mac was promptly removed from my office and sent to the warehouse to die a lonely death. Thanks for the offer adolph. As for donating the imac:  can't do that....the blue mac is my sister's imac (yes, i have to go and pick it up) and the pink mac is on its way to the valley this thanksgiving when we visit fidel. Captain Pinky winky is being re-assigned to what might as well be the Antartic.

       thanks for all the suggestions. I'm going to try to follow as many 'on-site' leads as i can. There are some depts (namely, physics) that use Macs all the time, so i may be able to get my hands on an old monitor from there, or at least a converting cable - we'll see.  Yeah, it's got an ethernet port. I don't forsee a prob actually getting the files off, just getting file sharing turned on!  JUST THOUGHT OF THIS!!!! - i also need an old mac mouse! I THREW THEM OUT!!!! ARGH!

       . . . in the PowerBook market right now, otherwise I would have that "hmmm, how do I justify buying..." feeling about Apple's displays. The new 12" still has the dongle connector, just like the old 12" and the iBook,  urlLink but now it is "mini-DVI out."  In my 12, the video out is VGA; it works with the good old analog standard. Apple's  urlLink current displays  are available only in ADC, or Apple's proprietary digital video connector for which there is a DVI to ADC connector. So with the new Powerbook G4 12", you can run a Cinema Display.  ( . . . on the other hand, my old PB may be able to use one of the adapters to get DVI out . . . )

        I've been getting up to speed with css for the 2004 BP MS 150 site and have started to discover how challenging browser quirks are. At first, I thought totally using em as a measurement was the way to go. When you look at the  urlLink Em Measurements  page in Safari, everything scales up and down when the user increases or descreases the overall font size. An em is a unit of measure based on the size of a font and changes based on the size of the font. This is really nice. However, Internet Explorer does behave the same way. Instead of resizing the position of any block defined by an em measurement, it keeps the blocks in the same place and stuff gets yucky. Today I'll be checking them out in Windows browsers. Below are a few experiments:       urlLink Em Measurements      urlLink Mixed Measurements      urlLink Mixed Measurements 2      urlLink No Stylesheet

       on my way home there is an island with a row of meticulously spaced trees planted in it. In these trees a horde of black birds gather at sunset. If you drive by (maybe on your way to blockbuster or even kroger) with your windows down you can hear them cawing at each other. If you walk by the area you can see the white caked bird poop spotting the road, sidewalk, and grass.  What you also see are feathers -- seemingly hurled to the ground, like darts, the way they poke out of the ground.  Pictures soon.

       History                    "La Quinceanera" The tradition of the quinceanera comes from ancient Mexican society. The origin of the quinceanera can be traced back to the Aztecs about 500 B.C.  Purpose: Fifteen was the age at which boys became warriors and girls were also presented to the community because they were looked upon as the vital force          of the tribe and its future since they had the power to become mothers and to give future warriors to the tribe. The fifteen-year old Aztec girl was exhorted and instructed by the King in the duties of womanhood, and the funeral honors for an Aztec woman who died in childbirth were the some as those for a warrior who fell in battle.  In Mexican society, the quinceanera evolved into a rite of social initiation intended to teach and to reinforce important cultural values.  In modern times a quinceanera is celebrated to acknowledge a young maiden's passage into womanhood. The ceremony is a reaffirmation of the baptismal vows made by her parents.

       well, i tried to open your 'officizing' swf in qt pro, and that won't work. i guess, it was made post qt 5. anyway, when i double clicked the swf from the desktop, it launched flash and was there on the timeline as if i had the original flash (.fla) file. I thought that was weird; i expected flash player to launch and play the swf itself. Anyway, from there i exported the movie to qt (and qt video; there are two choices). When i exported to quicktime, it cancelled the export and said there was something up with my version of qt (as if it were too old). When i exported it as a qt 'video', it exported but came out chopped.  The words 'officizing' were chopped off and the right side was also chopped. Weird. Any ideas....?

       anyone:  is there anyway to save an swf to an avi?  prolly, the first thing you are thinking is, "why would you want to do that anyway?" The reason is, cause my boss asked me to. (I'm pretty sure the final destination is powerpoint -- it's ALL ABOUT POWERPOINT here at MDACC.) I pulled down adolph's 'officizing' swf from chairjockey, and tried to open it in various apps that i have. None would open it, save internet explorer (which, of course, has the plug-in to play swf), but couldn't save it/export as a different file.  Is there anyway to do it without having flash software? also: does flash have the ability to save as mov/avi?

        Success!     Holy Smokes they bought it!  My brother and I just got back from our meeting with the editor and art director of the mag.  They wrote us a check then and there!  Also, the meeting was funny because my brother had just gotten back from a dental appointment and half his face was numb so he couldn't really talk very well and every tim he would try to interject it sounded really funny.  funny ha ha.  Anyhow we celebrated by getting some kick-ass chicken schwarma at the lebannese bakery down the street.  Thanks again for your help!  Who knew you could actually get paid for staying up until 4:30 am every night for 2 weeks hunting down semi-colons and apostraphes...

        Taggart, a URL would help. In general, if the img height and width selectors are greater than the image, then pixelization can occur.   {Update:}  Oh, I get it, nevermind...

        The Haunted SUV        Todd , I think that you should get an engineer from Disney to install the same mirror technology in your truck that they use in the "Haunted Mansion" (you know, the one where you look in the mirror and between you and the other person in your car there appears to be a horribly disfigured or othewise scary ghost/zombie/undead creature).  Imagine how funny it would be the next time the neighborhood youth kid guy checks his hair in the morning! It would be a lark!    Oh shit,  did I just say just use the word 'lark'?  Dear God.  Also, you could make up a story about how the SUV is haunted by the mangled souls of the Automobile and Oil company executives who were responsibile for the earth wreckingly poor gas mileage of said autombiles.  Also, the SOB who came up with the term 'Sports Utility Vehicle' would be known to haunt the truck too.  But he would only come out on the 5th full moon of every month.   Also,  thank you  everyone for taking the time to look at the  urlLink fahrenheit demo  for me.  I really, really appreciate it!  Also, I should mention that both the images and and article body html (fonts) are data imported from past issues  Also,  Happy Halloween!

        I noticed that too...   Paul:  I noticed the images too, but figured it wasn't all that important since it was just a presentation piece. I figured what was really important was the functionality of it. It worked nice for me.   Todd:  Sorry i wasn't around last night. I, once again, had a headache from hell. I slept in the car on the way home and was in bed by 9.   Taggart:  Another apology goes out to taggart for missing adolph these last couple of days before he takes off for austin. I wasn't able to get the disks to him to drive to austin for those of you who are interested in upgrading to 10.3. I just upgraded my sister's computer last night (archive and install) but wasn't there to see it finish. I put disk 1 in the computer and had my sister finish the rest.

        cars as mirrors    i do pretty much the same thing every morning. i drag my ass out of bed, take a vitamin (because diana loves me) drink some water, urinate, head downstairs to make coffe. since i make a point of being 'in my chair' by 8:00 i frequently have my last cigarette just before 8:00 out on the front porch. every morning a young man, presumably a high school student, follows the sidewalk in front of the house down to the bus stop. he invariably comes to a halt in front of the large, curved rear window of my truck, checks his hair for a minute or two, then continues on his way.  this amuses me.   paul :   fahrenheit looks very good. everything works/appears intentional. if i had any complaints they would be minor, like the numerous type styles used for different articles. good work.    adolph :  you are a punk.   posted with paper lantern.

       OK so I haven't really read much lately - don't have too much opportunity for this - what with tending to baby and hubby - for e.g. - last night I came home with a terrible headache - baby was hungry - nursed him - i went to the bathroom - when I emerged - baby wanted solids - I made him some potato and eggs and some steamed veggies (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower) - hubby wanted eggs too - made eggs for hubby - lil sis in law wanted some food too - made her some eggies - finally sat to finish feeding baby while hubby ate - then i got to eat baby's leftovers and an egg for me - then we made a run/walk to the fabric store - i am turning my husband into a frog for halloween and as per usualo - am waiting until the absolute last minute to make his costume - have no idea how i'm going to turn 2 yards of green felt into a frog suit - but tonight will be interesting - anyway - got home - baby was tired from the exciting jogging stroller ride and exploration at the fabric store - gave him a bath and managed to wrestle him into slumberland shortly thereafter - so my evening was over before it even started - so no time to read except when I travel for work I found myself in the bookstore falling all over my red wheeled suitcase at the airport - trying to find a book that my boss recommended to me a long time and I couldn't remember the author's name or even the title - and it had been on the bestseller list for a while and who knows how long ago that was too - so I ended up picking up a book called - The Piano Tuner (forgot the author) but it was a National Bestseller - I selected this book because it didn't seem silly or goofy and had to do with someone in a war and all sorts of other interesting stuff but I never finished reading it - because in the first few chapters, there were two deaths - both babies I had just left my little boy at home for two day separation and was not able to stomache these stories so I can't tell you if it was a good book or not  I did read a fun book though a while back - the devil wears prada - ha - it was just a fun read and made my life story seem so much easier  by the way - i finally remembered which book my boss recommended - the davinci code - which i recently ordered from barnes and nobles - i'll tell you all about it when i get it

       Paul, I love that book Things Fall Apart .. we had to write term papers on it in one of my english classes in high school and a good friend of mine turned in a paper with a yam -- the paper had just one sentence on it -- "Here's your damn yam, Okankawa!"  -- I couldn't believe he did that -- best of all, the teacher laughed so hard she decided to give him an A for originality.  Any other recommendations, Paul?  By the way, I've been meaning to ask what part of Cali. you're in 'cause I have a friend, a beautiful Indian girl from Trinidad, who has very bravely decided to pack up all her things and move to cali to start a plant nursery ... she doesn't know anyone there but it's always been her dream ... so, anyway, maybe you could offer her some insight on places to go, etc.?

        Distiller for that...  You would have to use distiller in order to get a multi-page pdf like that...illustrator is funky that way. I remember one the scientists in the physics dept. made an entire poster on illustrator (! 4'x6'!). i had serious issues getting that one to print correctly....it was near when i first started, (almost two years ago) so i can't remember how we resolved it.  There was also the issue of why when you make an 'artboard', say 5x5, it sits on a dotted line that measures out the width of a standard piece of paper? I talked to colin about it...he just tries to ignore it.

        If you see an image that you would like to post, right-click or (Mac) control-click on the image and open the image in a new window. The web address of the image should be in the address bar at the top of the window. Copy that image location. It should look kind of like:  http://www.somewhere.com/somelocation/somefile.jpg   To put the image in your blogger post you will type the following into your post:   &lt;img src="http://www.somewhere.com/somelocation/somefile.jpg" align="right"&gt;   You can modify the alignment of the image by using align="left" or align="center" or just leaving the alignment out. The important part of the tag (tag: the part between the &lt; and &gt; signs) is the img, meaning image, and src, meaning source.

        Opening the keyboard...  I don't think i took any pics of opening the keyboard. Carol bought the wrong mouse so i returned it. They didn't have any wireless pro mice at the physical store, so i have to order it online. Maybe sometime in the next couple of weeks.   Taggart:  i opened fontbook, created a new set and added 'classic sans' fonts from todd's fonthole folder he gave me so long ago. Worked fine.  so i created another set, classic serif, and proceeded to add those....no go. Same with scripty, corroded and weird....for some reason won't let me import anything else...dunno why yet.  Photoshop seems to work fine. No problems there. Even istop motion seems to launch fine. And, of course, paul's gold master version of 'paperlantern' works like a dream.

        I went ahead and did it...  I upgraded the powerbook this morning while i worked on Dr. G's RSNA poster: Image-Guided Percutaneous Biopsy of Mediastinal Lesions: A Review of Various Approaches.     It's really perky. Mail launches a lot faster. Even my most hated i-app, iphoto, launches and works faster too; although, i did recently archive and erase a lot of my photos so it's hard to say what it is. Expose is just WAY TOO COOL to even describe. Haven't tried any of the big apps yet except for InDesign, and only to look at something specific.   TODD To answer one of todd's concerns, yes, expose does take over the fuction keys that normally control the pallettes in InDesign. I haven't looked for a solution to that yet. I'm sure they can be changed.    UPDATE: YES. THESE CAN BE CHANGED EASILY. expose has it's own tab in system preferences.

        urlLink Slashdot | Diebold Chases Links To Leaked Memos  The latest corporate "intellectual property" scramble is Diebold chasing students for papers scattered into the internet. Reading about this I visualize Keystone Kops and evil mustached lawyers employed by Diebold chasing after hacky-sacking students who have picked up dollar bills a Diebold ATM machine has spewed out; the instant they catch up with any student there is another around the corner waving a miraculously multiplied dollar bill. Another bill, and another, there are more copies than originals and they are all the same.   Along with that I'm thinking about politicians giving concession speeches. What happens if a politician thinks he (or she) lost and gives a concession speech, but it turns out that they won? Is the concession nullified? Does the conceding politician nullify an election by giving the election to someone else, who effectively wasn't elected?

         urlLink Google Search: fork   A fork is when a single original is edited twice, making two distinct new versions from the original. I've been considering what it would take to make a versioning content management system. I think important features of a content management system include:  Versioning  Embargo/Expiration of content (the arrival and departure of a content item should be able to be controlled chronologically)  Context Awareness (content items should be aware of what contains them and what is linking to them)  The tricky part I'm thinking about now is forks in versioning. Maybe I should just ignore forking at the data storage layer? How could the application layer intellegently deal with forks within the same content item?  Hmm.,  urlLink Nukes  As you can see, the Nukes engine has a notion of versioning.  This feature is not present in the original PostNuke engine.  The persistence engine of JBoss uses a feature that increments the version and it keeps old versions as long as you want them.  This way you can rollback in case you missed something. This is very useful as you work on a live web site.  Also, the makeProd toggle enables you to select which version will be publicly displayed to your visitors.  I wonder what that looks like at a database level.

        Sorry...  sorry, taggart, but today is my sister's birthday. I would love to hang out, but we're having a little get together at the house for her. A fresh Red Snapper is sitting in lime juice right now, and a strawberry marbled cake is sitting on a warming rack waiting to be 'iced'. But if you really wanted to take me to lunch, i would like that. I'm placing the order for Panther today, and Adolph is paying me in 'Fish and Chips'. So maybe we could make it a group lunch.   how long will you be in town?   In other news...   Poor paul stuck in soot.  Adolph has tiring weekend.  Colin teaches drawing cause Laura is sick of it.  Killy buys four new tires for his car  Todd hates waterskiers   urlLink 40 people dead in Bagdahd   If anyone listened to NPR this morning a letter from a soldier recently returned bashes the media for reporting on the chaos in Iraq, "...but what about the schools we've rebuilt?" he asks.

        Tre Weirdness.  I was looking at  urlLink Macrumors  and thier post about  urlLink dailytunes.comS  which basicaly functions as a site that recommends music that you can buy from the itunes store.  One of the bands they recommend is The Post Service, which is on the  urlLink Subpop  label.  It is in fact on the itunes catalog along with Mudhoney, but the rest of Subpops catalog of bands is absent.??

        Just Like the Showdown     As the fires have crept closer to San Diego the smoke has gotten worse, the sky darker, and the light weaker.  There is no fresh air to be had.  Everything is covered with soot, and everyone's eyes are burning.  Its just like being at the Showdown on a Thursday night.  Our house is full of refugees.  Among them  is Josh whose flight to Lima, Peru was cancelled because an air-traffic control tower had to be evacuated.   There is also my brother's girlfriend Rachel and her two cats and dog.  She got here just before the city shut down the freeway out to her house.

        This morning, here in Pompey     I awoke this morning to the creepiest of mornings.   The time (adjusted for daylight savings) was 8:30 am, and my room was still dark.  A sudden fear gripped me that perhaps my beach plans would be spoiled by rain.  I stepped out on the front porch, which faces east , to investigate and saw a really beautiful sunset.  I watched in confusion for a few moments as the sun set in reverse- climbing the sky from east to west.  I also noticed that the front-porch, which always kind of dirty, was this morning truly filthy, covered in about a 2 centimetres of dusty dirt.  Extending my observation the street revealed that the entire street looked filthy, and all the cars looked filthy too, and all the plants, mailboxes, roofs, and windows.   Even the litter piled up in the gutter looked dirty.    My brother stumbled out of his room at this time and I told him to come out on the porch and take a look.  He said "a fire, a really big fire."  I had been thinking "alien invasion, finally an alien invasion."  I got online to check the news and read about the  urlLink  humongous wildfires  that have erupted around Los Angeles.  So now, an hour later the sky is still dark, and the light is still orange.  The sun is a perfect red orb:  lidless like the eye of sauron

        Considering...  I'm considering buying it with the education discount. I'm pretty sure i can buy two software titles with my education discount a year, but i'm not sure. In any case, i believe that would bring my total to $69.  I'm with adolph on this one. I'm not interested in upping my OS quite yet. I'll prolly just read about it for a week or two before i break down and buy it. Or maybe my co-worker will have bring by his CD for me so i don't have to buy it.  Speaking of, i saw a g5 in the hallway today and a fat cinema display headed for the sixth floor.    By the way, adolph:  There is an update for Keynote 1.1.1, but you have to have upgraded to 10.2.8 to use it. I'm not sure what it addresses, but you may want to look into it. I know you want to use key for your presentation (in december?)

        I don't think anyone has it yet (of us, that is). I'll prolly pick it up this weekend, although Killy may work on the academic discount angle. My machine has become more of a worker bee over the year, so I'm probably not going to throw on a new OS until I've been reading  urlLink Macintouch  for a week or so. In any case, Amber and I are seeing  urlLink David Sedaris  this evening, so I can't make it to the Apple Store for "Night of the Panther."  I considered racing down Memorial Drive to the  urlLink Galleria  (not seriously). On the other hand, I'm really not all that hot to go to an Apple Store chock full of Mac-geeks, so I'm glad I have an excuse not to go (seriously).  This weekend I'll be staffing the Kemah and Houston  urlLink MS Walk , so I won't be just dying to upgrade OSes anyway.  Speaking of,  Taggart, Todd,  I plan to head to Austin early next weekend, Friday afternoon. Amber will join me later in the day. Are you guys going to be around?

        HELP!  ORIGINALLY WRITTEN LAST NIGHT AT 11:15 P.M.   update  sorry, adolph. i had updated the firmware and failed to restart. so i did. and it works just fine now. as a matter of fact, i'm using the wireless keyboard right now!   adolph:  having trouble with the wireless keyboard. i was under the impression that i had bluetooth on this computer, but it seems to be telling me that i do not. I don't want to believe that, however.  Could i just be crazy? In the network tab in system pref's there is a bluetooth modem adapter, but that's all i see. do i need an additional bluetooth adapter? i remember at one time 'turning off' bluetooth since i didn't use it. before, the bluetooth icon on the top right was just kind faded out, but now it has a squiggly line through it... is it just disabled? when i click on the icon, it says...Bluetooth: Unavailable.

I got in the car and followed our normal route home: holcombe, the buffalo spwy, bissonet, edloe, 59 south HOV lane, exit williams trace....  Carol called me as i cheerfully headed home...  C: Hey, are you home yet?  A: No, I'm on the HOV lane just passing westpark...  C: What are you doing on the HOV lane?  A: oh my god...i am so stupid...

        Packing Peanuts or Rice Cake?       Apple shipped the wireless keyboard in a much larger box than necessary, so it was filled with packing peanuts. When i opened the box many of the peanuts spilled out, but i managed to get all of them up before the baby could get to them, or so i thought.  Well, adolfo iv managed to find the ONE peanut that i didn't pick up. Carol was playing with the baby in the living room - they were crawling around with each other until carol was tired. He stopped in front of the tv and just sat there with his back to her. He was suspiciously quiet.  When she went around to inspect what he was concentrating so hard on, he had mauled the packing peanut into about 30 smaller packing peanuts, with 20 or so in his mouth.

        Back, Back, Back and more Back  What a good Thursday this turned out to be, even if i DID forget my glasses at home. Usually, this results in a tolerable headache by 11:00 and an untolerable migraine by the end of the day.  Fortunately, this didn't happen - just a slight 'tolerable' head pounding all day. Had a great breakfast, an even better time at conferences and a good printing run of posters. To top it off, i get a call right after conference letting me know that the powerbook was in, wife called to let me know she was getting on a plane, and someone placed a reasonably large order of prints from Jen's wedding.  Adolfo's smile was priceless when he saw his mother he hadn't seen in two days. He was sitting in the sink getting a bath when we walked in the door...  Carol had one last dinner to expense that counted on her 'business trip' so we headed out to Outback for steak. Killito was exceptionally happy to be with both his parents.  daddy deserved a break after the last two nights so i headed out to the cafe for a cup of tea and some blogging...

       Below is the full text of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's memo on the war on terror:  October 16, 2003  TO:  Gen. Dick Myers    Paul Wolfowitz    Gen. Pete Pace    Doug Feith   FROM: Donald Rumsfeld  SUBJECT: Global War on Terrorism  The questions I posed to combatant commanders this week were: Are we winning or losing the Global War on Terror? Is DoD changing fast enough to deal with the new 21st century security environment? Can a big institution change fast enough? Is the USG changing fast enough?  DoD has been organized, trained and equipped to fight big armies, navies and air forces. It is not possible to change DoD fast enough to successfully fight the global war on terror; an alternative might be to try to fashion a new institution, either within DoD or elsewhere  one that seamlessly focuses the capabilities of several departments and agencies on this key problem.  With respect to global terrorism, the record since Septermber 11th seems to be:  We are having mixed results with Al Qaida, although we have put considerable pressure on them  nonetheless, a great many remain at large.  USG has made reasonable progress in capturing or killing the top 55 Iraqis.  USG has made somewhat slower progress tracking down the Taliban  Omar, Hekmatyar, etc.  With respect to the Ansar Al-Islam, we are just getting started.  Have we fashioned the right mix of rewards, amnesty, protection and confidence in the US?  Does DoD need to think through new ways to organize, train, equip and focus to deal with the global war on terror?  Are the changes we have and are making too modest and incremental? My impression is that we have not yet made truly bold moves, although we have have made many sensible, logical moves in the right direction, but are they enough?  Today, we lack metrics to know if we are winning or losing the global war on terror. Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?  Does the US need to fashion a broad, integrated plan to stop the next generation of terrorists? The US is putting relatively little effort into a long-range plan, but we are putting a great deal of effort into trying to stop terrorists. The cost-benefit ratio is against us! Our cost is billions against the terrorists' costs of millions.  Do we need a new organization?  How do we stop those who are financing the radical madrassa schools?  Is our current situation such that "the harder we work, the behinder we get"?  It is pretty clear that the coalition can win in Afghanistan and Iraq in one way or another, but it will be a long, hard slog.  Does CIA need a new finding?  Should we create a private foundation to entice radical madradssas to a more moderate course?  What else should we be considering?  Please be prepared to discuss this at our meeting on Saturday or Monday.  Thanks.

         urlLink That plastic is going to get hothothot , however, a slot-loading drive and other improvements are going to make it a real contender to the PB G4 12". I think the only difference, other than the case, is going to be the PB G4 12"'s more extensive video capability. Seeing a PB G4 12" run a 23" Cinema Display at the Apple Store the other day was pretty compelling. Additionally, Bluetooth is a build-to-order option rather than built-in.  If you have an older Powerbook G4, sell if you are thinking about it, because the value is fixing to fall through the floor. The only things the  urlLink older titanium PowerBooks  have over the iBook G4 are weight, screen-size, PCMCIA card slot, larger potential RAM capacity, and spanning video capacity. All of these are good advantages for the right consumer, but most older titanium PowerBooks are slower, have slower motherboards, have smaller hard drives, etc.

         urlLink Dave Weiner writes about the structure of directories,  and I think, how the hell do you do that? Essentially, a directory is composed of like-formed objects that have information and links to other objects of inforamtion and links.   Directory Object   Information about object.

        Petanque || Bocce = Fun    So there weather is ridiculous here so I found myself at the beach the other day playing a game of  Bocce  and swilling  Tecate  until the sun went down.  When I was in France, the silly Frenchmen would gather about the same hour and play  urlLink Petanque , a close relative of  Bocce .  In retrospect, I think what we were playing on the beach the other day really was Petanque and  not  Bocce, seeing as we did not have a true "court" set up, and  the only real differences between the two games are that true Bocce requires a "court", with backboards and such for bank shots, and in Bocce you  must  roll your ball.  I guess there are spelling and pronunciation differences between the two games too.  See  urlLink below  for a real explanation of the differences.  At any rate  Petanque/Bacce  was really a whole lot of fun.  Its like playing horshoes/marbles with miniature holeless bowling balls.         Petanque vs Bocce  from  urlLink www.petanqueamerica.com    We are often asked what the difference is between bocce, the Italian bowling game and petanque.  First of all bocce balls are larger and solid, about the size of a grapefruit, colored (green & red are popular),  and generally made from resin or wood. Petanque balls are the size of an orange, hollow, and always made from metal. Bocce has different variations as to court size and layout. The court should be smooth and flat; some rules call for wooden sideboards to make it an enclosed area. Petanque can be played anywhere; most players actually prefer an uneven terrain to make it more challenging. Bocce players mostly roll their balls, petanque players tend to lob them in the air. The counting of points and game tactics are very similar between the two games.  Conclusion: petanque is more flexible, and the equipment is easier to carry around.

          urlLink Nostromo SpeedPad n52  Man, I was just checking on the Belkin website, thinking about getting a different mouse for home and bringing my current home Belkin up to the office, and low and behold, a new Speedpad is out! Those folks at Belkin must have been busy over the last few months, what with new iPod accessories, this and more coming out. I think the  urlLink n52  is going to make a worthy upgrade to the  urlLink n50 . More buttons, looks like it will fit a hand and different sized hands better, another row of keys, better position for the special function lights, and two additional thumb buttons. They could probably change their driver to make a  urlLink half keyboard  out of this thing now. I guess the question about the n52 is: Is there going to be an upgrade to the  urlLink Nostromo n30 Game Mouse ?

Came home and detailed the car. I got every single mosquito, dragonfly, moth, etc carcass off the front end of my vehicle. I vacuumed every cheerio and rice cake crumb out of the back seat. I even had to shampoo out a chocolate stain from the back seat that carol left in the wake of a 'brownie earthquake' from dairy queen.  Went to the church and arranged a meeting with Knights of Columbus to take the 'Santa' photos at the church this year. They normally sell polaroids @ five bucks a pop. There is so much overhead that they hardly make any money. Apparently, they were cancelling the pics this year for this reason.  I approached the Knight pres. to propose shooting the santa pics digitally. So i have to meet with the council on Tuesday night.   Lunch   Chicken,tomato, onion tacos with rice. Two flour tortillas One bowl of cheerios for dessert  Today, we set up the xmas tree. My mother pulled it down from the attic and we put it together. Adolfo iv helped.

        The Valley Report - day 3, Saturday   Breakfast : Hotel Buffet (free)  eggs, hash browns, pineapple slices, one pancake.  We woke up much later than we really wanted to. We left the echo hotel much later than we realy wanted to. Our original plan had us home, in Houston, at about noon. We left the hotel at around 11:00. We stopped at the nearest HEB and picked up some water and fruit for the trip. Once i got on 281, i realized that i was going to spend that entire BEAUTIFUL day in the car.  We quickly got off 281 and hit 107 to drive by Carol's old house: the house where we looked at each other at her brother's wedding; the house where we were married in her parents bedroom; the house where i fell asleep on the couch after a huge homecooked meal; the house that saw carol drive her car through the living room wall when she was learning to drive.  We drove on a small dirt that ran along side her house, up and down, about four times. I stopped to take photos. I used up one roll of film (120) - it felt like six rolls.  (taggart, if i send you the negs, could you scan them for me? on the imacon? - i guess i could also go to carl's place if you couldn't)    HCHM , or the Hidalgo County Historical Museum. Admission: $4 - We went to the newly renovated HCHM. Nice place. Look at some  urlLink photos   From there:  LUNCH   Carne Guisada (Tres Portrillos restarante)  We had lunch with my sisters. By this time, it was 4:30. We left the valley from there. We took the back roads to Elsa, past Delta Lake again. In the distance a black column of smoke stained the sky. I thought immediately of the sugar cane fires that light up the fields around Delta Lake in october. I didn't think sugar cane lasted this far into the 'winter'. As we passed through the other side of the lake the sugar cane fields were still there with their heavy green manes waving in the northern winds ( norteos ).   These are the same winds that would blow the smell of rotting cabbage into my dad's new home when i first moved in with him in 1992. What is now a pretty established neighborhood was then a dirt filled lot outside of weslaco next to some fields. At the same time the weather got nice enough to have your doors open, the fields behind us were filled with rotten cabbage.  We made it to Odem, TX before we had to stop at the Dairy Queen. This is the same town (and the same DQ!) that my mother & father would 'make the trade' after the divorce. The exact halfway point from Houston to wherever my dad was was the Dairy Queen in Odem. Lots of weird and somewhat painful memories. I wish they would build a Whataburger in Odem.  The baby ran around charming the pant off everyone in the place for about half an hour. I had a hot dog and a side order of incredible guilt. Luckily, he fell asleep once we got back on the road and it wasn't until we were 10 minutes from the house that he decides to wake up and scream; scream because he was still in this damn carseat; scream cause he couldn't be in his mother's arms.  Home. The feeling is indescribable. I went to bed happy.

        Photo Gourd (revisited)   Paul  - I finally posted jennifer's wedding with the photogourd template you sent. I'm still encountering a problem, however. When i add an image to the cart, I get a 'missing image' icon on the screen. What is that supposed to be? a thumbnail of the selected image?  also: when i 'send' the order (presumably to myself) that doesn't work either....  Can we try and fix this (or explain to me how to fix it) this weekend?

        The Valley Report - day 2, Friday   Breakfast   A huevos rancheros plate from a small mexican restaurant. As you can imagine, this is very, very, very bad for me. It came with a sausage patty. I ate it.  We met my sister's at a small Mexican restaurant off of Closner in Edinburg. Adolfo iv decided to thorw the largest tantrum he's ever thrown. We had taken him out of his chair to walk around after we had finsihed eating. I was talking with my sister's and carol walked around the restaurant with him. He was getting a little too close to a family so she moved him. He went nuts. Totally nuts. He threw himself on the ground and screamed. I was in awe. I had never seen anything like it. Carol took him outside and i took care of the bill. He wasn't very happy getting back in his seat either.  We spent the most of the afternoon at my sister's house. Carol put the boy to sleep and my sister's and i caught up.  We had  lunch  around 3:  Fish and chips. Another dish that is going to kill me.  We checked into the echo hotel, ordered room service for the kid (grilled cheese and a fruit plate - $9.00)     We hung out in the room all night. Quietly. Lovely Quiet. So far....  They have a wireless network set up here in the lobby of the echo hotel. Sweet!

        The Valley Report - day 1, Thursday - Thanksgiving  Fidel now has the same amount of dogs as kids: 4 - and they bark. The first night was restless, the dogs would bark, then stop. Then start, then stop. Then start. Always at exactly the same intervals that i would fall asleep, then wake up. Then fall asleep, then wake up. Then there was the neighbors music...  Carol woke up at 6 a.m. to put the turkey in. Adolfo iv woke up at 8:18 a.m. We came to the living room and watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory   Breakfast   2 egg beater eggs 1 serving of refried beans 1 serving of carol's potatoes 1 glass of chamomile tea little bit of oatmeal  Fidel's wife's brothers showed up for breakfast. The most memorable thing today, so far, has been Fidel going outside and plucking a branch of  chillitos  from his pepper tree and passing it around the table. Carol and the two brothers plucked chili's off the branch and dropped directly into their beans.  nice.  12:45 - We try to get the baby to take a much needed nap. He refuses. The turkey is done. The mashed potatoes are almost done.   3:00 - Thanksgiving Dinner (lunch)   One giant serving of white turkey meat (breast) One giant serving of mashed potatoes. One giant serving of stuffing straight from the belly of a cooked turkey. Six spears of asparagus. Several heaping spoons of vein clogging gravy One piece of hot apple pie topped with napolitan ice cream.  The rest of the afternoon was spent just sitting on the couch watching the kids run from one side of the house to the other. And this went on to the evening. Carol ended up renting a couple of movies, but I had seen them all. I think we ended up in bed at around 11 or so.   Midnight   The dogs. Barking. The dogs.   1:00 A.M.   The dogs. Barking.   2:00 A.M.   The dogs. Barking. I move to the living room hoping that the further i get from the back yard the better time i'll have sleeping.   3:00 A.M.   The dogs continue to bark.   4:00 A.M.   The dogs are still barking.   5:00 A.M.   Barking   6:00 A.M.   I can't belive the dogs are still barking.   7:00 A.M.   Barking. I'm trying so desperately to sleeep. I move back to the bedroom since it doesn't matter where i am in the house.   8:00 A.M.   We wake up and tell Carol as politely as I can, "Get me the HELL out of here." We leave Fidel's house promptly at 8:45 for breakfast with my sisters.

        The Valley Report - the drive  I got out of the office right after 1 o'clock. The plan was get home, pack the car, pack the baby, get on the road. We got to the house and fell promptly asleep. The baby had just fallen asleep for his nap, carol lay next to him and i was on my mother's la-z-boy. We woke up around 3:45 or so and quickly got out of the house. We were finally on the road at 4:30.  The traffic leaving sugarland was pretty stacked. Things cleared up right at Richmond.  Right outside of Wharton the traffic suddenly began to clump up again. Once we came over the freeway hill we saw a pretty nasty accident. An SUV was overturned in the median (and banged up pretty horrendously too) and a mini-van with it's front end totally crushed in. There were fire trucks and an ambulance already there (there is a hospital nearby) and we saw a couple of stretchers being loaded into them. Luckily there were no blanket covered bodies scattered about. Carol can't handle seeing stuff like that.  The baby was hungry. About 4 miles from the accident site we exited fm 102 @ Wharton and went to the Whataburger, which also happens to be right next to the hospital. We put shoes on the baby and went ahead and had dinner there. It was about a 1/2 hour stop. Which is just about how long we have to keep the baby out of the car so he forgets that he was just in it - this keeps him from having a fit when we try and put him back in the car seat.  This tends to make road trips a lot longer. We did this twice.  We drove straight through Victoria. We stopped in Refugio for our second stop at a gas station with a Subway in it. Carol changed adofo iv's diaper (twice). We let adolfo iv roam around the gas station (it was one of those extra big stations) for about 1/2 hour.  I stood outside for a bit after i had re-organized the backseat for carol. I couldn't belive how many people were on the road. This was one of those super gas stations with like 15 pumps; they were ALL full and had cars waiting. There were families stuffed into bug smattered cars. There was a handfull of cars towing other cars (something that is so common here - i couldn't help but think of Carl Deal's explanation: they're smuggling drugs and money in the bumpers of these cars)  We sailed through woodsboro, odem, corpus christi, robstown.....the boy falls asleep at robstown......  I stop for gas at Bishop: a little over $11. The boy stays asleep. We get to Kingsville and start on the 60 miles trek through King's Ranch void. I hardly feel it. We exit Bus. 77 just outside of Raymondville and take the backroads through Delta Lake to get to Elsa. Here, on this set of roads, is where my car is practically slathered with bug bodies. Particularly cool was a lightning bug that lost his shiny butt-juice on my windshield. It was pretty cool. I was sad it only happened once.  The fog was particulary bad.  We got to Edinburg at about 11:30, for a total trip time of exactly 7 hours.

        Happy Thanksgiving!    urlLink     Now I am in Dallas ... Thanksgiving dinner at my brother's friend's brother's mother's house.  Dinner was so good that  I  urlLink hurt  myself.   Just rolled in from Oklahoma City.  Not an amazing town, but we did meet some great people there; also my brother's band put on a fantastic show.  I was so thrilled to hear them at their best- and to see people really responding to music, even dancing!  The band will be putting on a show in Austin at Emos on Sunday night ... Come out if you can!  Also, the pic is what my brother sees when he puts on his ring of power

        They get so much stuff wrong:  urlLink Reuters | Latest Financial News / Full News Coverage : "and before the DRM gets locked on." The DRM in inherent to the file. When the file is played QuickTime decodes the file to play it. Johansen's utility uses QuickTime to play the file into an unencoded file instead of sending it to the audio manager.  I think it is pretty interesting that Johansen took this approach. Was he unable to decode the files with brute force? Did he want to avoid that approach for political reasons? I think that one of the unsaid implicit things about Apple's DRM is that it appears to be custom encoded to each customer. This is unlike DVDs, which are all encoded the same (for each region at least). This also makes "DVD Jon's" task more difficult. Essentially he would have to break public key cryptography, which once broken would wreck great harm to commerce in general.

        Battle for my veins (day 2)   Breakfast   1 serving oatmeal 1 wheat toast (again, with butter) 1 apple (red delicious) 1 patty turkey sausage 1 10 oz. apple juice (from concentrate 100% juice)  I am charging up the ipod for our trip down to the valley this afternoon. I am waiting for Dr. M to get his last few images to K (my boss). We are just waiting. There is nothing else to do but wait. Just waiting. Waiting. Waiting.  One of the things i hate about going on long car trips is how dirty the car ends up once you've arrived. I hate pulling the little bodies of moths and dragonflies off the grill of my car. I hate having to scrub my windshielf extra hard to get the smushed up bug bodies off.  Gosh, i want to get out of here so bad. So bad. So bad.  My wife is bored at work too. So bored.  So bored.

         urlLink Griffin Technology iTrip  I played with Killy's iTrip today, and found it a real wonder. I plugged it into mine and even though I didn't have the station selection software, it still played out of the 87.9 frequency it was set to from Killy's iPod. I played it at my apartment into my stereo and I realized that the iPod and iTrip together weren't all that much larger than a conventional remote control. Essentially, they become an alternative universal remote control in which the music you are playing resides in the remote. Not only can it control what is playing on any radio-capable device, it also brings your 30 gigs of music to play. Flat out amazing.  Last night I found my cassette adapter and remembered to bring it down to the car this afternoon. It was nice to play the iPod through it. I wonder if it was just the different song, or did I hear a qualative difference in bass response and crispness with the cassette adapter? Is it enough to make me avoid the iTrip and plug in the iPod in the dock to stereo at home and the cassette adapter in the car? I wonder how long it will be before someone makes a radio that can be controlled by those unused data bands within FM frequencies. It would be so nice to be able to really remote control every function of a stereo with the iPod.

        The Battle for my Veins   Breakfast:  1 green granny smith apple 1 serving of oatmeal (with honey) 1 'Healthy Choice' egg - kinda like 'Egg Beaters' (surprisingly good) two pieces of wheat toast (buttered - unfortunately i didn't check the toast before they gave it to me. I chose NOT to take it back. Sinfully delicious.) One 8 oz. 100% juice orange juice   Yesterday i had lunch with adolph. My  friend  ate an avacado burger and a batch of beer battered onion rings in front of me while i had a mustard filled chicken breast sandwich. I didn't go away frustrated though. i packed two onion rings in my doggie bag and ate ONLY ONE later that afternoon along with the rest of my sandwich. Delicious.  We have another lunch planned for today,   In other news   Talked to colin yesterday. He had just gotten back to Portland from his grandpa's funeral in texas.

Since I am going to miss yet another Thanksgiving with my family I went to see my grandpa out in Montebello (east of East Los Angeles).

We just had to excuse him for not swinging by to pick up his Oscar. For those who dont know. Roman Polansky has been living in exile because he slept with a 13 yr old girl. Neither of the two should be forgiven. It just really sucks that two really incredible artists are so *%*^ UP!!!

I wish everyone safe and entertaining travels for Thanksgiving! Carolina, we'll miss you guys in houston-we'll be there for tues pm - sat am. Maybe we'll cross paths?! My friend recomended the book: Girls Poker Night . It sounds like chick flick meets book-so it sounds fun. I'll give a review soon after I finish my metaphysical healing book.

         well, i am torn on the inDesign issue. while i do not really LIKE using it ID 2.0 is not a bad program   but it ain't quark.   all of the printers i have worked with (except one in san antonio) accepted inDesign files. it has lots of great features, like transparency, and can do everything QXP does, more or less. i am not crazy about their type style set up and some other minor quirks.  overall, it gets the job done.   urlLink this  is a really, really great addition. if everyone sends me money for chairjockey (ahem) i'll buy it. good stuff.

       Yes, for the $40 lost. But really, for the sad killy story. That is so sad killy. Will you be well enough to eat thanksgiving dinner? How much weight have you lost? Starving? Man, I really wish I could give you a big hug right now. So, is that a new room in hell? Sounds like it to me. Please, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy, or that guy that lost $40 on the slot machines. When you're poor-you equate every dollar into something really worth while that you can't really afford-like sushi dinner, or a few good CDs, or payment to the hospital for sewing up your husband's face, or groceries, or a nice trip...together, or that much more contribution toward a really nice camera for my aspiring photographer-anything. Of course if he had won, I would have been singing his praises. I'm actually on probation from complaining about anything Taggart does-He can do know wrong.....until that scab heals-then it's on!

        Da-Hoe?  Your job comes with $40 dollars gambling money? Or was that a self-imposed limit? I hear the dealers at the blackjack tables are nicer to you when you lose than slot machines: they laugh as you  walk away  from the table.

       Yeah, I see they also ran into the same problem I had: if you reduce an image with "scan lines," you wind up with larger and smaller lines due to a  urlLink Moire Pattern . It didn't make any sense to me at the time because you'd think that everything would reduce evenly. This isn't the case. More awful Moire Patterns are evident when people scan in line screen images from magazines and whatnot. The software that overcomes this uses stochastic proccesing, maybe? I forget the name of it.

In other news, I've returned from Miami, where I only left the conference for a night-time rendezvous in beachside hammock with Amber and five digit dinners with lots of raw oysters and stone crab and big fatty steak. Unfortunately, the brunch salmon on the final day got to me and I spent my free Saturday in the bed and by the toilet of a somewhat expensive South Beach hotel instead of sight-seeing. I still feel yuck today, and I attribute most of it to being knocked off food for less than a day or so. I'm completely food-dependant, an addict if you will, and can't imagine several days without real food, like Killy has faced. At least I still have enough energy to hustle to the bathroom!

        Diagnosis: Starvation!?  The last couple of days have been somewhat better. My mouth isn't so sore in the mornings and my breath isn't so bad. I've treid to ween myself off of vicodin since the extraction. I now take about 400 mg of Ibuprofin (motrin) instead.  I got a phone call from my doctor with the results of my blood tests on friday afternoon. I had gone in for a true doctor visit on wednesday. According to my labs i was clinically going through starvation. I was aghast. Starving?, i asked. Yeah, are you eating?, she returned. By the time she had called me i had shoved a filet o' fish down my gullet.  That didn't go down very well. It upset my fragile stomach for the rest of the afternoon. I don't remember if i ate anything else. My mouth was still really sensitive.  My first REAL meal came on saturday afternoon. I ate oatmeal in the morning, and tried a full day of activities: we got the baby ready, left the house for the mall, then to target, and other miscellaneous activities.  Our first stop was the mall. After about 1/2 hour i nearly collapsed from exhaustion/hunger. I walked out of there using the stroller to hold me up. I came back to the house and put a tuna sandwich in my belly and a glass of apple juice. I felt dizzy and lightheaded - like i had eaten a ten course meal. I collapsed in the bed and slept for about two hours. I felt a little better afterward and we tried again.  Target, this time. 1/2 hour in there and i began to feel weak again. Carol was adamant about getting me a full meal. She asked me what i wanted: mexican food. We stopped at a small mexican place where i got a full plate of green chicken enchiladas w/ all the trimmings.  With each bite i got dizzy and lightheaded again, but kept eating. I just powered it in. I got through all the beans, rice and ONE enchilada. I felt as full as i'd ever been. We walked the full feeling off at half price books (right next door) and then home for a full fledged nap.  At the end of the evening...my breath didn't smell so bad. Like  fresh  beans, maybe...

        Sunday: Fresh Breath  Fresh Breath! even in the morning...at least, comparatively.  Most of the sores have subsided. The bites i had been giving the right side of my mouth are still a little sensitive as is the empty hole left by my wisdom tooth.  We woke up and went to house of pies. I had a plate of bacon and eggs with eggbeaters rather than eggs and left most of the bacon. The hash browns were buttery and good and had just the right amount of 'crisp' (something the avalon diner just can't get right.)  Came home and processed the four rolls of black and white film i have accumulated here at the house. adolfo iv slept peacefully and carol read The DaVinci Code, which, by the way, carol is flying through. She loves it. We went to Borders after breakfast so she could look at some DaVinci paintings up close.  Processing film is a relatively simple process here at my mother's house. The fridge has a 'chilled water' outlet in it. At this time of year, the water comes out at EXACTLY 68  Believe it.  Two 120 rolls of junk and two 35mm rolls of a day i spent at the beach with adolfo iv, adolph and amber, and another of....i don't remember. i'll scan some and get back with you...

        Governator 3   #this a {text-decoration:underline;color:blue;}     Well I just watched  Terminator 3  which as you all know stars the new Governor of California (He is to be sworn in today).  Since the horrible, horrible  Matrix 3  was still fresh in my mind the 3rd Terminator movie did not seem so bad by comparison.  I actually thought that the story was OK, if badly delivered.  Compared to other number 3's it ranks pretty  good  well.  For example, it was better than  urlLink SuperMan III , but worse than  urlLink Godfather III . It was better than  urlLink Planet of the Apes III , but worse than  urlLink Star Wars III  (by that I mean Return of the Jedi). It was certainly better than  urlLink Phantasm III , urlLink  Batman III ,  urlLink Rambo III  and the third  urlLink Herbie Goes Bananas  movie but it was not as good as  urlLink Rocky III   or  urlLink Indian Jones III . Of course it does not compare to some great number 3's like  urlLink Red  or   urlLink The Ten Commandments III

        Periocronitis and the day without straws  update:  i went to the dentist where i discovered i had a condition called periocronitis. with this condition, the skin surrounding an exposed wisdom tooth is pinched beneath another tooth.  the gingivo-stomatitis aggravated the skin around my wisdom tooth with a lesion, that in turn was pinched between another tooth, then, it swelled because of the pinching which, in turn, led to an aggrivation of the gingivo-stomatitis.....  and so on and so on.....  so what happened this morning was an extraction of my upper wisdom tooth to keep from pinching the bottom skin, therby facilitating the healing process. i'm already on antibiotics, so that's should help too.  and of course, my precious, vicodin for pain.  Now that i've had a tooth extracted, i can't drink anything through a straw or i'll break the clot that forms in the spot where my tooth once was. I guess i'll have to be spoon fed a smoothie.

        Did anybody listen to      urlLink Fresh Air's  story about journalist Lutz Kleveman's book about the battle over oil reserves in the Caspian Sea?   His new book is The New Great Game. The book is about the battle over the world's largest reserve of untapped oil and gas resources, located in the Caspian Sea and surrounding Central Asian republics.  The oil alone is said to be worth $4 trillion.  Kleveman claims that the United States, China, Russia and Iran are now engaged in a power struggle for control of the region's vast reserves and pipeline routes. Lutz Kleveman was born in Germany and studied at the London School of Economics. He has reported from war zones in the Balkans, Asia and the Middle East for the Daily Telegraph, Newsweek, CNN, The Independent, Der Spiegel and Die Zeit.

        tuesday night....  i sat around the house with sores in my mouth all day. the pain of it is so all-consuming and frustrating that i can hardly think of anything else.  i took as little medicine as possible; although, i'm about to pop another two vicodin to try and make my night a little more manageable. When carol got home, she took me to Smoothie King for a smoothie. I had forgotten that those things existed. Bless them...  I have another dr's appt tomorrow at 10 a.m. where, hopefully, i'll get an extension to my work leave. My sores aren't getting any better and having to pop vicodin all day at work doesn't sound pleasant, even though some may disagree.  The new Job? Please don't jinx me todd. The last thing i need are all my crops to die and house to burn down.  but speaking of new Jobs, Paul is coming into town on the 24(?) to begin an illustrious career with piston design?!

       Sucks to be a P.C. user.  urlLink Activation  is Adobe's new pirating  software.  On a windows based computer after installation of Adobe's software and putting serial in you must either "Activate" the software; i.e. Photoshop, by calling adobe or doing said activation online. Wow. My dilema is a bit different.  Manana I am going to a store to buy Photo CS. Why?  Well I have to spend money.  Why? because Canon Sucks HARD!!!. My Canon S40 takes Raw digital files. When I bought it the software that came with didnt have ANY OSX ware on it. So I SURFED my way over to Canon's website and downloaded a OSX compatable utility called simply "FILE VIEWER"  not the best ever but it worked for conversions to tiffs. Not needing the software that came with I kept it just the same just in case. Almost a year later (two weeks ago) I give in and just throw it away. Now I am running .3 and well I figured that I would just waltz on over to Canon's Website and download it again. WRONG!!!  NOW you need the origanal C.D. to install the software. I called customer service....they said I was Shit out of FREE luck. But I could BUY some for 35$.!!!!!!!!!!!! So I figured I would spend 50$ for the Photoshop RAW plugin so I could edit the RAW files in their natural state and convert them if need be. WRONG. Since CS now automatically supports RAW files (I checked the specs the S40 is supported) they have discontinued the ware. So here I am. Activision is not on the Mac version of CS. I have been wondering about becoming semi legal. Carl has voiced his support. Mark has as well. Here I go.

        One of the things we are evaluating at work is going to an ASP (Application Service Provider, or outsourcing it to someone else) model for our online e-commerce activity rather than DIY (Do It Yourself, AKA Adolph makes it up as he goes, doesn't do a bad job of it, and saves the bacon now and then). One of the large disadvantages of the ASP is that the transaction costs are high: 5 to 6%. Our own effort costs us 2.5% and some of Adolph's effort. Our effort doesn't has as many bells and whistles, but those could be added.   The significance of the additional 2.5 - 3.5% is that most of our fundraising comes from events and an increasing amount of that activity is online and would be subject to the ASP transaction percentage. If we are an "83 cents on the dollar goes to our mission" organization, would the additional 2.5 - 3.5% mean we are an "80 cents on the dollar organization?" Would the bells and whistles grow something faster than its natural rate of growth? Would it be worth growing if we were a less dollar efficient organization per fundraising dollar?

       If it makes you feel any better I have been asked who punched me at least 5 times today. You will recover and you will have lost some of that "baby" fat. Carol has the abililty to remind Kilito that she had the experience and discomfort of giving birth to him later on in life and you too will be able to describe your pain when Adolfo wrecks daddy's car. I will always till my dying days have this scar on my face.... to remind me that if I can tolerate this pain without the slightest bit of real anger or remorse (but just a little pretending for pity) that is how much I love Liz. See ya soon and I hope you recover soon.

        The Road to Recovery?   Tuesday   No change in the sores in my mouth. I woke up every hour last night. I finally got out of the bed at five, my mouth throbbing with pain. I couldn't open it, i couldn't close it; my mouth just hangs there dry like a burnt out house.  I tried to drink water - painful. I went to the bathroom to rinse out and moisten my mouth. Slowly, very slowly. I fell asleep with my head down on the kitchen table again. I took my fourth antibiotic pill (on schedule) and another vicodin. I wiped my mouth with more kanka and went back to the bed at around 6 a.m.  I woke up at 7 as my mother was leaving with Barbara and the baby to take barb to school. She had left me some oatmel in a small bowl. I tried to eat it while she was away. My mother makes oatmeal the way i love it: kinda lumpy. There's no real chewing involved, but there is some mashing that has to be done before you can comfortably swallow her oatmeal. I couldn't do it. Impossible. Too painful. I almost threw the bowl, i was so frustrated.  Angry. Frustrated. How long am i going to live with this....

        Panther 'bug'  I seem to have come across something rather weird that has infected my computer for the last few days, and i wonder if anyone else has experienced this:  There are occasions when my modem icon on my bar across the top will continually scroll "disconnecting...." when doing so. There is nothing i can do short of restarting to remedy it. I've tried to relaunch the finder; i've tried opening internet connect to maybe cancel the disconnect, but it doesn't work, at all. It scolls "disconnecting..." where my modem icon is. I can do anything else, but i can't do ANYTHING with the modem.  It does it under these circumstances:  1. I close my laptop lid without disconnecting first.  2. From time to time, the modem 'unexpectedly hangs up' soon after it's connected. Many times i have to try and connect several times before i get a good connection. From time to time, it will 'disconnect' as part of this routine. the scrolling 'disconnecting...' will not go away....  This is really annoying cause i have to restart my computer every time this happens. i've looked at macintouch, but didn't find anything in their reader reports. has anyone else seen this anywhere else? adolph, have you experienced this? (i'm sure you haven't since you use an airport station...)

        I'm working on a new project that will first be implemented in Perl and then I plan to port it to ASP so it will run on our chapter website ( http://www.nmss.org/txh ). I am writing this to get Paul's advice and to outline the functions for myself.   Project: Keyword Application  Keyword application will be a single file that stores the application and data necessary for the execution and maintenance of a keyword based url redirection system. The idea is that instead of entering in a long URL, we want to point people to our chapter website "and enter keyword: foo." The user will go to the chapter website and then enter "foo" in a simple form. The form submits the keyword to the keyword application and the user is redirected to the desired URL. Additionally, the keyword application should be able to intelligently deal with mistyped keywords and the internal users' needs for keyword addition, correction and maintenance.    If keyword.pl is the recipient of a keyword lookup form action:	  It should look up the url for that keyword. 	  If there is a URL matching that keyword, then issue a redirect to the URL,  	  else display message of none matching and display a list of valid keywords.     If keyword.pl does not receive a form action:	    It should display a new keyword and URL form and  	  display a list of current keywords with links to delete and update each.     If keyword.pl receives a new form action:	    It should add the new keyword and url to the file and  	  display the URL form and list of current keywords.     If keyword.pl receives a delete url:	    It should delete the selected keyword and URL and  	  display the URL form and list of current keywords.     If keyword.pl receives an update url:	    It should display an update form with the selected keyword and URL information in it.     If keyword.pl receives an update form action:	    It should update that keyword/URL with the keyword and URL in the update form and   	  display the URL form and list of current keywords.

          Last night after a marvelous day spent with Elizabeth, she is so busy rarely do we get to spend whole days together; we were going to go to Mark's house for dinner watch a movie, and drink some wine. We usually bring Bodi, our dog, along to play with Mark's dog Milo.  We both walked around the back of the car to load the pooch, Liz opened the back hatch, and I realized that my matte board, and matte cutter were laying down in the back. It all happened so quickly. Bodi usually takes a running start and leaps into the back, He loves car rides. I realized that if he jumped in my nice museum board matte boards would be ruined by his weight creasing them. "no,no,no,no!!!" I rushed forward to halt the Bodi. With cat like reflexes Liz slammed the back hatch. We are thinking that because she just got back from working out at the gym she was a little more pumped up than usual. Well as I came forward and the hatch came down....it came down on MY FACE. I was thrown to the ground......sprawled out flat. I recovered pretty quickly/ Liz found my glasses which were violently knocked off my face.  My glasses were fine and at first inspection (my own using my hands) my head seemed to be fine.   Liz was a little shocked and I declared "I am all right, no blood."  A little shaken myself. Liz voiced her disagreement.  She demanded that stay still while she got a towel. So I felt my nose and felt the blood, coming out the TOP of my nose, not the bottom where it is supposed to. I jumped up and ran to the bathroom ignoring her orders and saw the enormous tear running across the bridge of my nose.  You could open and close the wound by pressing up along the bridge of my nose. I declared that stitches were in order and ran back to the car where liz met me with cotton balls and a towel. We arrived at St. David's emergency room.  Signed in and waited for 2 hrs before the physician attended my nose. Dr. Szkrybalo at first was a little tense, he was having a rough night, nobody was happy and were dissatisfied with the E.R.'s service. Liz began telling him that next semester she would be doing a clinical in this very E.R. because she is a U.T. nursing student and things began to ease up. While he quilted my face I asked how long he had been practicing. 13 yrs as a E.R. doctor. He started as an Army doctor. The worst thing he had ever seen has a shark attack while he was stationed in Somalia, Mogadishu. The shark took the hip and leg off a twenty year old soldier swimming in the ocean when he wasnt supposed too. He died. Six stitches later I was done. Over 500 dollars of damage for my uninsured ass. Made it home a little before midnight after we stopped by Mark's to pick up a valume to help me sleep. Today I feel fine with little or no pain. The stitches come out in five days and I will post another picture of what that looks like.

        My own, My only, My PRECIOUS....      Monday   The vicatin is nice, but he kanka is nicer. 20% Benzocaine does the trick. I woke up this morning at five unable to sleep again, after an hour of tossing and turning. I sleep in 1 1/2 long fits. It wasn't a goood night last night either.  I ended up loaded my mouth up with kanka and falling asleep with my head on the kitchen table. It turns out that resting my forehead on my arm and sleeping is very comfortable for my mouth, cause it just hangs there. I did droll all over the table though.  My mother came to the kitchen at 6 a.m. and covered me with a blanket. She sent me back to bed soon after. She wiped the entire table with a clorox solution.  I had chicken and rice soup broth for breakfast, and a glass of water. I went back to sleep around 10:30 with a vicatin in my stomach.  I just woke up to the feeling of my mouth again. I wiped my mouth with more kanka, scanned it and started typing...   p.s. for the record, MY pc at work has 1GB of RAM.

       I tell you, I swear up and down by breast feeding.  Not only did my little boy fight and beat this horrible disease that my husband now suffers from so terribly, but I never got it. Not yet anyway.  I will be surprised if I do.  We all sleep in the same bed with my poor sick husband, but I haven't gotten sick. Thank God. What would happen if I did though? Don't even want to think about it.   Amber   What is your email address???

        I'm thinking that sometime next week I'll test out the Impression to iPod backup by installing 10.3 on the iBook at the office and then restoring the backup onto the newly clean iBook. The only thing I have on there is a MySQL database, which is easily backed up. I should work on a chron job to get that regularly backed up and zipped to a SMB share. The prize fulfillment stuff on that computer is kind of business important, and the hard drive is kind of noisy, I worry about it. What would I do if the HD in that iBook went down? Maybe get an external firewire bootable?  Cron job script:  mysqlexport ...foo  gzip...foo  Curl...foo

        urlLink Amber , The purchasing stuff online adds a level of elaborate-ness known as e-commerce. There are a few different routes you can go in that:   Use a third party broker  like iSpot. This is the least hassle for you. They handle the e-commerce mechanisms, payment processing, send you a check periodically.   Pro:  You focus on making art and a little bit of marketing, they handle things like getting a digital certificate, banking, accounting, shipping/fulfillment (maybe).   Con:  You lose margin to their costs, you lose a bit of control, while you can point to your work on their site or maybe even have editorial content there, your customers may see something else they prefer.     DIY e-commerce shopping cart, third party payment processing  would give you control over your own shopping cart system and push purchasers to an intermediary secure webpage for payment. If you go with something like  urlLink PayPal.com , then you don't have to have a merchant account with a bank, but you lose more to transaction costs. If you go with something like  urlLink Verisign's PayFlow Link  you have to have a  urlLink merchant account , which seems like it is easier to get now-a-days.   Pro:  Lower transaction costs, you control your product/website, you don't have to get a digital certificate for secure payment processing.   Con:  better transaction costs that going third party, but not as good as your own stuff. Your purchasers will go through a third party for the payment part.     Total DIY  probably only makes sense if you are a business worried about branding, wanting to keep control over every step of the process, etc.  In this scenario you have to purchase a digital certificate from Verisign or Thawte (a Verisign company). A digital certificate is a special key file that locks the encryption between a user's computer and the server so that anyone eavesdropping on the conversation between the user and the server just sees gobledy-gook. You can actually generate a digital certificate on your Mac, however, Verisign and Thawte provide "signing" services: Web Browsers look for a special bit to the certificate that means that it was okayed by Verisign or Thawte. There are other services, but none as accepted as those two.    Pro:  You control each step of the process depending on nothing other than your website; you probably get the best rates depending on volume.   Con:  You have to set up each step of the process. And spend a few hundred on the digital certificate, and worry about having a Dun's number to do business, and get a merchant account, etc.

        The long road to Diagnosis: Gingivitis-Stomatitis  This is a combination of infections affecting my tounge and the gums. Severe infections (which I unfortunately am saddled with) cause small painful ulcers on the gums, tonsils, foul breath, and bleeding gums. This may be accompanied by fever.  I got this from my son, who i had taken the dr. on tuesday of last week, he had some sores in his mouth that were bothering him. The dr. blamed it on a virus, signed us out and shipped us back home. Those are the worst dr. visits, when the doctor can't even do anything for you. It's on those days when the doctors might as well be your kooky witch doctor uncle or that hippie aunt, who swears by a tequila mouthwash for cold sores.  Well, adolfo thrived that week. Carol noticed that he wasn't eating as ferociously as he normally does, which was prolly in part to the discomfort in his mouth. I was fine, until   Thursday   I woke up feeling feverish, but not physically hot. Just really strange. Thinking back, i can't remember when I felt the first sores in my mouth. I continued with my day, more because i had to, than because i wanted to. Carol was in Raleigh, NC for the night and was flying back in that evening. I got to work and sat with a resident for four hours attaching arrows to radiological images for a Dr. G's RSNA poster. 70 images with arrows on each one. It was gruesome. I was dizzy the whole time, and even though i know my office was cool i was sweating.  We took a break at 10:15. I ran immediately to the nearest nurses station and had my  temperature taken: 98.7. Normal.  ( Diana/Liz:  is there a name for feeling feverish, but not actually having a fever?)  I sat back in my office somehow made it through placing arrows. By that time, i knew i was not going to last much longer. I told my boss that i was going to go home early and made all the necessary arrangements. I left the hospital, took the bus to the car (i park the car near the museum and take the bus in when carol is gone), and drove directly home. I napped for an hour and a half and then loaded up the baby and got on the tollroad at 6 headed for the airport. I made it there right at 7:30, when carol's flight was supposed to have arrived. I was sweating in the car. My head was pounding. Luckily, the baby was asleep peacefully in his carseat.  Carol didn't show up till 8:30. My head was pounding and since adolfo iv hadn't seen his mom in a day he cried, the whole way home. I was bent over in pain. Fitful sleep. This first night i am restless. My mouth is swollen and dry with sores, i am drinking water all night. My body is aching with every movement.   Friday   I am too sick to get out of the bed. Carol stays home from work cause the baby is not feeling too well either. I am pumping myself full of tylenol, water, and soups. My fever is a constant 100 all day. My sores are beginning to freak me out.  This is the day when every medicine in the cabinet comes out. I am using orajel to sooth my sores; i am taking tylenol and motrin; to get some rest, my mother buys me a new bottle of nyquil. I take it all.  The final blow: i mouthwash with a cupful of Tres Generaciones Tequila. It was smooth and it helped me sleep.   Saturday   The fever broke this night. My side of the bed was wet with sweat. My sleep was interrupted by applications of orajel and glasses of water taken into my body as if i had never had water before. I drank it over the sink slowly (it was becoming harder and harder to swallow comfortably.)  The sores in my mouth were more bothersome. I rinsed and gargled with salt water. This seemed to help. I stayed in bed most of the day, doped up on motrin and tylenol. It was official: i could no longer 'eat'. All i could do was drink. Somehow, in my sickly stupor, i was convinced it couldn't get worse and i would feel better on sunday.   Sunday   I woke up at 3 a.m. coughing. I could feel new sores in my throat. There had been an explosion of sores in my mouth. My mouth was swollen with sores, my saliva tasted like blood. My breath could melt glass.  I put on my jeans, and told my wife i was driving myself to the emergency room. She stayed with the baby. My mother wouldn't let me go alone. She drove me to methodist hospital in sugarland. She put the windows down because she couldn't stand the smell of my breath.  I was there for four hours: two in the waiting room and two in the exam room. Everyone who looked in my mouth was visibly shocked (two nurses and one doctor.)  I was prescribed comfort medicine, since this childhood disease is caused by a virus: 20 vicatin pills, 20 antibiotic to prevent secondary infection of the sores, and a substance called 'magic mouthwash' to deaden my mouth. I also got doctor's orders to stay home from work for three days this week because i am extremely contagious.  ( my biggest question is if this one of those diseases that will 'bounce back and forth'??? )  So i've been in and out of conciousness all day today, with no REAL relief. I'll let everyone know how things go these next few days.

         urlLink StrategyPage.com - Gallery  Pretty amazing stuff. I'm not certain if the turret blew off or if the entire thing was blown upside down and they pulled the hull off the turret. In the shots where you can see the turret, the interior seems pretty intact. Since it is physically improbable that the ammunition cooked of and blew the turret off, my guess is that the loader and TC were the KIA, the gunner the WIA and the driver the survivor.   In the details: lots of fluid around the tank means that nothing caught on fire per say, just diesel and hydraulic fluid everywhere; a kevlar helmet on the ground near one of the skirts, the front few skirts are made of incredibly heavy armor, it takes and enormous hit to take them off like that; no tracks, did they take them off before they flipped the hull back over? It may have been easier to pull them off when it was upside down than when it was right-side up; the damage to the suspension was probably mostly from the mines and partly from rolling it back over. In an image of the hull, you can see the door next to the turret ring open and the gun tube cleaning pipes partly out. I had forgotten about that stuff on that side. On the other side of the turret ring is the NBC system.  Seeing the hull without a turret reminded me of cruising around the country north of El Paso thinking that it would be really cool to have an M1 without the turret. It isn't a slow feeling vehicle, but without the weight of the turret it would make a real fun off road vehicle. You could put in some seats and maybe a sun-shade of some sort in place of the turret and have a nice camper. The back deck is large and flat and stays warm from engine heat for a long time.

        Flash Gallery, First Impressions, Computer Questions    Flash Gallery  Because I needed to brush up on my ActionScript but mostly because I have  zero social life  I re-worked my online Flash gallery.  To maximize how tedious the whole project would be I decided to do  everything  programatically and  not  draw anything on the stage...  It was a total pain in the arse but I think it turned out well...  Both the  urlLink flash gallery  and the  urlLink html version  are fed data from the same xml document-  which makes updating them both super easiy!  Now if I only had some new paintings to add...

       Thanks for all the great info, Adolph!  Basically, we just want a few paragraphs of text, about 10-20 images, maybe a few links, perhaps a way to purchase prints and custom pieces on-line -- nothing too elaborate, really -- I'll look into registering the domain name and go to the apple store to see what they recommend in terms of software.  Muchas gracias!!  Those are beautiful images, Paul.

I'm still working out how I wan't to get this done. What gets archived to dvd, what gets incrementally backed up to cd or iPod....?

         urlLink Amber,     Domain Name:  To get anthonyfreda.com you must register anthonyfreda.com with a domain name registrar. The biggest (and not the cheapest) of these is  urlLink verisign.com . Most domain name registrars also offer web site hosting or at least domain name parking, where you can reserve a domain name before you get hosting set up. One thing to be on the look out for: some registrars actually register the domain name in their name and then you rent it from them. While any domain name has a periodic fee attached, getting locked into a renting arraignment will limit your flexibility long-term.   Web Site Hosting:  Web site hosting generically describes the wide variety of services available to store your website and send web pages to people who request them. In evaluating web site hosts, you first have to decide if you want:   Co-location:  where you own the computer and rent a space in a datacenter with power and a network connection. You pay for bandwidth too. Probably not what you are looking for.   Dedicated Hosting:  where they own the computer and you rent it from them and pay for bandwidth too. They take care of computer maintenance and backups. Nobody else's website is on the computer. Probably overkill for you.   Shared Hosting:  where you are renting usage on a computer that is shared with other people (which is invisible to you and to your website visitors). More affordable than dedicated hosting, they take care of computer maintenance and backups. This is probably what you want.   DIY Hosting:  where you buy an internet connection and a computer and have the domain name point at it. This is funner, but probably not what you are looking for.  To evaluate hosts you will be looking for:   Reliability    Space  How much stuff can you put on the server? If you are putting up a lot of Anthony's work, then you may need additional space.   Bandwidth  describes how many web pages/images can your web site host serve up. What is the maximum traffic you think you will have? Is that less than a standard hosting plan? What does additional bandwidth cost from a hosting company?   Database/Scripting Access  depending on how you build your site, you may need access to a database back end or a scripting language. In part, the web site development will pick your host because most hosts do not support unlimited languages. At its most basic you are looking at Microsoft's ASP (Active Server Pages) or a Unix host with Perl, PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocesor). Either can also run languages like JSP (Java Server Pages) or CFM (Coldfusion Markup).   Cost  most expensive may not be more reliable or offer as many goodies   Other features  such as email hosting, backups, etc.     Web Site Development:  How does a web site get built? You probably want something a little more elaborate than some text files. What is the purpose of the web site? Is it simply an Internet brochure? Does Anthony also want to use it as a tool for clients to download art? Once you get some theoretical questions out of the way and figure out what you want to do, the web site developer outlines functional requirements for the web site and analyzes whether off-the-shelf software can be used or if you should invest in custom software. The balance between the choices can be described as "no need to reinvent the wheel" vs. "can't put a square peg in a round hole." Other key considerations along with web site function are navigation, graphics, and initial content.

       Hey guys, I actually have some computer questions for once, and I thought instead of taking the subway all the way to the Soho Apple store, I could just ask ya'll, instead.  Anthony and I want to set up a website for his artwork -- we want to set up an easily identifiable page, somethlink like "anthonyfreda.com" -- and then we need to build the site.    1st:  How do we reserve a specific domain name?  2nd:  How do we build the site on our own?  We need something very user-friendly because we really don't know a lot about html, etc.    Right now, he's using a very expensive host site that sets up the page for him completely, but he has very little creative control and he's grouped with a lot of other artists, so we really want to have something that we can change whenever we want, add new images, text, links, etc, and also that is easy for clients to remember when they want to see his work on the web.  Any ideas?

        Another low tech try  I was thinking that you could accomplish something by placing a small sized flat mirror directly behind the transparency. You would have to play around with the settings tho. If you only had a flatbed scanner w/o the transparency adapter, your scanning options would be limited.

        Lazy Sunday  Whoever is reading this i'm sure that it is cloudy, cool, and occasionally rainy. That is the way it has been most of the day here in sugarland.  First thing this morning i had to search the car for a cache of diapers cause we frantically realized there wasn't a diaper in the house. Luckily for adolfo iv, his parents keep a loaded diaper bag in the car: enough, at least, to keep him dry for the rest of the day. I walked outside without shoes and realized quickly that it had rained that night. The car was pebbled with water drops.     Later that afternoon, the sun was out, but not for very long. I took advantage of it tho...     but then all of a sudden, the clouds rolled in. We spent the entire afternoon cleaning the house and playing with the baby...

       Take your transpanency and place a white piece of paper behind it, put them on the scanner close the lid and place something real heavy on the lid.  kinda low tech.

        Another day off  Adolfo IV slept like a rock after being at adolph's. Didn't wake up at all last night, but he  did  wake up at 7:30 and slap me in the arm to wake me up.  We got ourselves together pretty quickly cause carol had her xmas spa appointment @ 10 A.M. Once we dropped off carol, the baby and i headed to whataburger for his favorite breakfast: eggs, potatoes, a patty of sausage and biscuit. We picked it up at the drive-thru and headed straight for adolph's place.  He ate only a couple of bites and explored every corner of adolph's apartment, as he always does. We decided to get him out of the house. We walked along the metrorail tracks and headed towards the fountains near the cancer survivors memorial. We kicked the soccer ball around, we ran through the grass ... we tired him out, totally.  When we made it back to adolph's both of them laid down on his 'bed' and went straight to sleep. It was cute. Unfortunately, i was charging the camera battery the whole time we were out (i'm buying a spare soon, or course.) By the time i got back, it was fully charged; however, he was asleep....      2 1/2 hours later...   We picked up mom and went stright to eat at Jason's Deli. He devoured his lunch and basked in his mom's love. It's always so satisfying to see them together after they haven't seen each other for so long.

        Merry Christmas  7:19 A.M. - woke up to my son's smile. Carol took him to grandma's bedroom to wake her up. I took that opportunity to slip a couple of gifts i had been hiding in my sock drawer under the tree. We all opened gifts and emptied our stockings. The baby went straight for the new car, which was recently assembled (1 a.m.) the previous night. He loved it.     Carol was happy with her digital camera     I came away with an armload of new clothes and a couple of cool books.  We had a great breakfast and headed to my sister's house with a carload of presents. Diego really liked his automatic chocolate milk mixer cup, and dezma had a blast with her shopping cart once it was put together.  My sister also made a full breakfast with fresh tortillas.  Then, off to my aunt cynthia's house, where we are now. The baby came away with a toy car. Now, Carol is putting him down to sleep and I am losing energy, fast.  very fast....

He's got a horrible cough that wakes him up everytime he hacks while he's sleeping. His little body became hot with fever in the middle of the night and we had to struggle to give him medicine. Then, he gagged on one of his coughs right after he had nursed and threw up all over the bed.  Changed all the sheets.  Luckily work was dead. totally dead. the hospital was empty. I was let go at noon...and the xmas break begins.

        I was thinking the easiest thing to do is to leave the lid open, letting the sun light up the transparency. But what do I know? Maybe you could concentrate the powers of the sun with a mirror or a magnifying glass. You could practice "burn the ants" with your scanner head!  Killy, Todd, remember that old hand held SCSI scanner? Whatever happened to that old thing?

        Quick Reading list for the xmas week  I've picked up a good book recently:   1. Brunelleschi's Dome      Fillippo Brunelleschi was a goldsmith and clockmaker that would essentially re-discover architectural principals used by the ancient romans thereby revolutionizing the then current  method of dome building used throughout europe: gothic flying buttresses and wooden centering. The dome of the  Santa Maria del Fiore  church in Florence was originally conceived by Neri di Fioravanti in the mid 1300's that included a dome that would be the highest vault ever constructed.  At the time of conception, no one really knew how it would be built.   It's been a super-interesting read so far. There is a good amount of history and a lot of recognizable characters that put a lot of other things i've read into perspective (the medici's, donatello, giotto, etc...)  I actually bought it as a xmas gift for my cousin who is going to be travelling in italy soon, but i read the first chapter at Borders and was hooked. Carol found a used copy for about 1/2 the price online at amazon and ordered it for me.  The second book is a Kenzaburo Oe title that i hadn't seen before:  Rouse Up O Young Men of the New Age!  (exclamation point included)  It's a father-son/father of the father-father relationship book. Will report when i get into this one.

       A transparency adapter is typically a scanner lid with a light built into it. I think the reason for it is that the transparency is not as reflective as a piece of paper. The light in the lid shines though the transparency and allows the scanner sensor to pick up the full wealth of colors in the transparency.

       Yes, it's a flatbed -- I'm not sure about the transparency adapter -- I'm looking all over the scanner and I don't see anything like that -- is that something I have to buy separately?

       . . . enjoying reading Apple's "Pro" user interview series?  urlLink Apple - Pro/Film - Walter Murch : "The other thing is we shot and printed 600,000 feet of film, which is about 113 hours of material. The film is 2 hours 30 minutes long, so that's a 30 or 40 to 1 ratio. The first time we put it all together it was over 5 hours long. So you find more inventive ways to compress the story to find out what can be eliminated that not only doesnt affect the story, but actually, by its elimination, improves things by putting into juxtaposition things that formerly were not. It was a very complex orchestration, shrinking it by half."

        LOTR And The Positronic Brain    Killy, Carol, Adolph and I saw LOTR too last night.   Even though some of my favorite scenes from the book didn't make the cut (like the scene where the King of the Nazgul busts in the gate at Minis Tirith exclaiming "heeeeeer's the Witch King" a la the Shinning) I still enjoyed most of the 3.5 hours.  I even liked Peter Jackson's additions: like that scene right before the battle for Minis Tirith where the Orc General notices that one of the new orc recruits is scared and so he tells him the story about how he used to be a dentist specializing in Troll Orthodontics and General Goblin Orthondonistry and that he ran a modest practice up in northern Morder until one day a Troll patient woke up too soon from the anaesthesia and bit his hand off, leaving only a misshapen, lumpy stump.  I think it is great that Jackson added a scene like that to show that hey, orcs are just these guys you know?  Also, If you were intrigued by the  urlLink I ROBOT  commercial then you may like   urlLink this  book.  And if you have some time this Christmas holiday for some more reading I suggest you read the rest of the robot series starting with  urlLink The Caves Of Steel  and ending with  urlLink The Naked Sun   (or maybe even  urlLink Robots and Empire  - but that is only worth it, I think, if you read the  urlLink Foundation Series  ...).  Not only are they interesting sci-fi detective stories but they also offer valuable insights into robot culture/behaviour.  I definitely  see my robotic household assistant in a different light now that I have read these books!

This morning I was thinking, "how is it that Juan Williams thinks he is going to get anything close to the truth asking about intellegence gleaned from Saddam?" Lets see, government official will just spurt out "oh yeah, Juan, Saddam told us . . . , and Saddam told us . . . and as a result our work is nearly done." Does Williams think that government officials are evil villians to his smooth NPR James Bond and they are going to give away their plot?

Liz and I packed quickley and drove that night and arrived at 3:30 am. My Mother was very distraught being the initial witness to my Grandma's heart failure  and having to perform CPR. We spent the morning making the arrangments. The funeral is going to be Tuesday morning. We left the Valley after 6:30 p.m. it is now 3 to One. I have a big day of work ahead of me tommorrow and it is my official anniversary. We are heading back late tomorrow night. For those of you who pray please say a prayer for my Grandmother, my Mother and my family. I hope all of you are doing well.

A DELL   Have you considered Digital photography?  YES  What type of business are you thinking of starting up?   Portraits & portfolios  Do you already have a camera?  If so, what kind is it?   A digital camera. Kodak .   I don't know what other questions to ask him but I thought this might be helpful. Can you gentlemen post your ideas on the Blog when you have some time? Thanks!  Taggart.

          for christmas.  jeez tag, that's screwed up. there must be somewhere else you can live for a similar price that does not involve so much wildlife.  on the plus side; you are getting valuable experience in dealing with random, chaotic events in a cool, detached manner.  i am pretty sure that two police reports will earn you a 'get out of my lease free' card.  and rabid crack 'ho's running amuk in the living room is far more stressful than raccoon carcasses, i promise.

There are three drunk white college kids sitting on my front porch. WHAT THE FUCK. I tell them that I am going to count to three and that they had better get the fuck off my porch. I made it to two and then they saw my brother and tore ass out of there. Tonight. Liz and I are watching Two Towers and then we hear screaming. not screaming in a Nosgul kind of in the distance but on my front porch front door opening screaming running through my house. Then at the door of my bedroom banging screaming doorknob turning screaming leap out of my bed stopping big fat crack whore from coming into my fucking room. Crack whore screaming that a man is chasing her with a gun. ME screaming get the fuck out of my house. HEART pounding woman pounding on my door.

        Will Somebody Please Chop Off My Head     My Gosh  urlLink The Last Samurai  was one long, horrible movie.  I mean, there were a few neat looking samurai sword flashing fight scenes, and a ninja attack, and a couple of big battles, but the director makes you pay dearly for these brief moments by dragging you through a story of unparalled lousiness.Thank god I only had a straw and a stick of gum handy during the ordeal or I would have ritually disemboweled myself.  Surely the pain of slicing my guts open and feeling them spill out into my hands and then onto the theatre floor and then stepping on them and seeing the bloody mess mix with dropped popcorn and spilled soda would have been less than the agony of watching this film.   And the ending!   My Lord, the ending was so excrutiatingly, mind-boggingly bad that only my incredible tolerance for pain, and amazing physical endurance kept me from slipping into blessed unconsciousness.  Even thinking about it now makes me want to wretch.

It is a really fun group card game that requires the usual bit of luck and a tad bit of strategy and brain power as well.  I think we should try it out the next time we all get together!

Most of the games ended peaceably enough, but every once in a while tea-cups and saucers got thrown around, but that has mostly to do with the egg-nog and/or white-russians that  accompanied the holiday games more than anything about the game itself...

        Mary Jane & Ted Leo   Breakfast:  1 banana 1 egg beater egg 1 wheat toast 12 oz apple juice   I got to mary janes at about 8:15. I tried to stop by my old place to see if eric was around, but he was teaching. It was like travelling to another life seeing the old place; passing by taggart's old place; knowing that todd & little 'D' used to live just on the other side of cecil's...sigh.  They didn't let us in for about half an hour. A handful of us waited outside.  Two bands were up before ted leo:  spame an orange  and  the joggers  (from portland). I wondered if Colin knew about this band.  Orange had a Ben Folds flavor. I say that cause a piano was the lead instrument. Played maybe 6 or 7 songs. Eric called right as they were finishing up. He decided to join me once he got back into town from his teaching gig in league city.  The joggers were allright. It was loud and mary janes was small. Eric showed up about halfway through their set.     Ted Leo started off his set solo. He belted out a tune i hadn't heard before. The band joined him and played  Where have all the rude boys gone?

       Hi to all the blog-o-mite sandwiches in the audience. I have finished the interviews here at the reebok facility. Who knows if they are gonna offer me something. They all loved my work, or at least said they did, introduced me to more people the I was scheduled to meet, met with the people that i would most likely be working with, I think they all liked me alright. I don't know, it's quite possible that I come across as a pompous asshole, you all know me. So I am typing here at this corporate hotel with alot of suits, out in the middle of no where, not in boston but some little town outside of it...........tired. I think I'll go sit in the sauna.  cock-a-doodle-doo  OH, Killy, I love the line about wrinkled black football players.

        The State of Things  There is something comforting about stepping outside on these cold mornings. Old Fort Road is blue and dark intermittenetly broken by cones of sickly orange light from street lamps; the horizon is rimmed with wispy veil of clouds and it's quiet. Only one house, the one directly across from ours, has it's porch light on.  I am immediatly reminded of the duplexes that I grew up in. Particularly, i am reminded of the first days of school. It's these days, right after weeks and weeks of warm long mornings and sleeping late, that are the most memorable. I sleepily carried out the trash. I would sling the bag over my shoulders to make it easier to carry. It banged on the backs of my legs as i walked the distance of the driveway towards the sagging decrepid tower of duplex mailboxes, each with their mouth's hanging slightly open (ours never closed right). There, around this leaning tower, the trash was huddled like wrinkled black football players.  It was cold too. Even in my sweater. My mother didn't have the foresight (or the time) to start up the car twenty minutes before we left so it could warm up, so we would sit in the car and wait for the heater to crank up. The exhaust would billow behind the car, and the foggy windows would slowly become transparent. The school was literally right around the block so it wasn't long before i was pulling my sweaer off to keep from sweating in class.  And this is what i think of when i step out in the mornings, as i pull myself into my own car warming it up for our trip into town. One house over, light seeps through the cracks of the garage door; if i listen hard enough i can hear the neighbor loading herself into her SUV. Her door opens and she slides out and waves. I wave back, start up the car, and retreat back into the house.   urlLink

        iLife - First Impressions   iPhoto 4   iPhoto's been mis-named. This is iPhoto 2.1. No 'outstanding' functionality that shouldn't have already been there such as the much touted faster scrolling and faster action on renaming rolls.  Haven't been around anyone yet to share photos (My younger sister's laptop is with her at my older sister's house), so i can't comment on that, yet.  I'm not really impressed with the 'upgrade'. In edit mode, you still get the a substantial pause when you go from photo to photo. Scrolling is still a little jerky, but admittedly, faster. So is renaming rolls. Adding keywords to photos is a first for me, i don't recall if this was available in the previous version. I never used it till tonight. Obvious negative: you can't assign a keyword with a right click on a photo. You have to have your 'keyword pallette' open and you can't just double click a keyword to apply it; you have to highlight the keyword and then click another button to assign the keyword. Kinda tedious. I wish there was an easier way.   iTunes 4.2   Aside from supporting AAC....same thing.   iMovie 4   Definately faster performance, but the startup is still sluggish and it still opens up the last project you were working on by default. I wish this would change. It took a 45 sec count for iMovie 4 to open my current file, which does have a good amount of footage...   GarageBand      This is the coolest application that I know i'll never have time to truly use well. It's not as intimidating and aloof as say Flash, but it is a pretty robust program! In goofing around with it this evening I realized quickly that one NEEDS that keyboard to really use it effectively. I mean, you could play around with looping and stuff, but if you wanted to make a real song (and belive me, you could very very easily) it would be too tedious without a keyboard.  I read a lot about performance issues, with this app. I had none. Ran as smooth and killito's butt. Not a single hickup, but then again, I didn't have any other apps running.   urlLink for your enjoyment

         urlLink BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis   It is often perplexing to me when the culture of an organization appears defensive rather than accepting of criticism. Last month the New York Times did not cover large demonstrations protesting the terrorists within Iraq who are bombing things, etc. It was apparently well covered by local bloggers and since then, American blogs like Jeff Jarvis' (linked above) have attempted to take the Times to task for this oversight. In Jarvis' latest update, the Time's has responded and the response is composed of excuses.  This reminds me of my last interaction at the Apple Store. The power supply of my laptop went out and I went to the Houston Galleria Apple Store to get a warrantee replacement. The power supply is one of those show stoppers for a computer, nothing runs without it (although I'm not certain what failing on a laptop is not a show stopper). However, it is a small object that is readily available from anywhere. Still the Apple Store didn't have it.  The guy at the genius bar said, "we'll have one in two days and I will give you a call when it is in." I thought that was reasonable, because if they were out, it would take a weekday for them to order it and a day for the shipment to come in. However, that didn't keep my laptop running. I wound up buying a spare power supply, something that I had wanted anyway so I didn't have to cart it between the house and office all the time. Amber said that I should have been more upset, however, I have an understanding and acceptance of this sort of stuff.  The guy from the genius bar didn't call until the following  Friday . Amber said that I should definitely say something about this, so when I picked up the replacement, I said that I understand about supply shortages, but would like to register a complaint about how long it took to get a replacement. The guy immediately gets defensive and starts saying how they never know when their supply gets low and it is hard to forecast, etc.  I said okay, just to shut him up. As a result, I really hate the Apple Store and this guy in particular because (a.) I wasn't treated like someone who bought something for $2,500 with tax since they didn't fix the damn thing even though they had other stock sitting on the shelf, and (b.) when I try to politely state my complaint, with the utmost of understanding that it isn't his fault personally, I get treated to excuses as if I am being unreasonable.   This goes against the social mores of customer service culture. It isn't that the customer is always right, but when the customer has some input you accept it as their viewpoint and respect it as their viewpoint even if you do plan to file the input in the trash. If the complaint is due to an error, you can optionally state the reason for the error, but in all likelihood you don't bother because it doesn't focus on fixing the error for that person, the reason for the error is only helpful within the organization to avoid the error in the future.  Why am I thinking about all of this? It goes back to the Dean Scream. So screaming is part of the internal culture of the Dean campaign and the scream speech was meant as a rallying the troops rally instead of a general "this is who I am and this is why you should vote for me" speech. What, they all do a collective  urlLink Rowdy Roddy Piper  or  urlLink Hacksaw Jim Duggan  impression while listing the states they're going to go to? I think that it is pretty disappointing that Dean didn't respect and accept the viewpoint of Iowa voters but instead retreated to his internal campaign culture.  But maybe it isn't so bad.  urlLink Matt Welch  writes that . . . . . . having Dean going to all those states he named keeps the pissed-off wing of the party (not to mention non-voters) focused on the anti-Bush crusade, rather than trying to cook up some new Naderite charge.   I can't wait to fire up  urlLink Garageband  and product political fun like this:  urlLink http://homepage.mac.com/kmickey/.Public/LileksBushKnewRobots.mp3

        The Dean Scream Reloaded  I agree that Dean's speech after the Iowa Caucus was intended to rally his supporters rather than to re-iterate his platform. In that sense it was clearly campaign focused.   But I think this focus is understandable given the sense of deflation that his campaign must have felt after finishing so poorly in a contest that they were so hyped to win.     In contrast, Kerry and Edwards did not need to 'rally the troops' in their speeches  because: A) Kerry came in first place, and B) Edwards came in second place (when most people didn't expect him to make the top four).   Both candidates had the luxury of focusing on the issues  because both campaigns were, naturally, very pleased with the results of the caucus and did not need any 'rallying'.   I too found Dean's speech clumsy and the 'scream' bizarre, but it [the scream] does make more sense in light of what Dave Winer wrote in the  urlLink Scripting News: 1/23/2004 :   Several times during the meeting a loud crazy-sounding scream came from the room, everyone was doing it, and it was really frightening. The stuff of nightmares. This was before Howard Dean's rant. I asked Jim Moore what that was about, he said it's an Indian war yell or something like that, they used to do it in United Farm Workers rallies, and they adopted it at Dean For America. A few minutes later Dean let out the famous scream, it was the same scream I heard in the conference room.  They're probably not saying this publicly because it wouldn't seem contrite to do it, and they probably know they'd get roasted for saying the scream and ranting you heard was part of the motivational culture at DFA. Some have compared the Dean speech to a similar rant by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that made the rounds of the Net. So Dean gets a bit whacky, but after seeing it so many times, the shock value is fading. Taken at face value it wasn't anger, it was a steam-letting, and an attempt to rally the troops, and totally understandable.    Here Whiner explains that The Scream was "part of the motivational culture at DFA".    Now, I too had seen the Scream about a zillion times and was quite put off by it.  I too saw it as an outburst worthy of the World Wrestling Federation.  But had I seen coverage of The Scream along with the explanation that it was not a wild outburst, but rather a cheer that the Dean Campaign had adopted, I would not have concluded that Dean was an unstable, undignified Rowdy Roddy Piper.  But now its too late.

          urlLink Scripting News: 1/23/2004   The thing about the Dean Scream isn't really about the scream (it was more of an out-of-breath yelp anyway). It is about a politician who is so focused on the campaign that the campaign is what he talked about. If you watch the other candidates' speeches, they immediately start talking about the issues that they feel are important. This signifies recognition that the campaign is a means, not the ends. In Dean's speech, the campaign, the list of states that they are going to go to, is what is important. I wasn't particularly impressed with Kerry's or Edward's speeches, but at least they are issue focused. Dean came across as Rowdy Roddy Piper from the World Wrestling Federation pre-declaring victory in the towns the WWF will visit. (Maybe I was just peeved that Louisiana didn't make it on the list . . .)  One of the criticisms of the current administration is that they are using the bread and circuses of a minor prescription drug benefit and various military conflicts as a way of maintaining their grip on power. Well, in Dean's scream speech he doesn't seem very different, just more clumsy. When did rallying the troops start being about winning for winnings sake and stop being about the things that affect ordinary people in everyday ways?  Besides being undignified, it seemed like his campaign didn't have a clue what their message would be if they lost. The campaign-centered and undisciplined speech indicates to me that either Dean's team doesn't plan for failure as well as success or that Dean doesn't follow his team's plan. Either way isn't a pretty sight.

       i had a dream last night WHEW crazy nightmare many issues first -  Laura called me  from Sunny Beach a tropical place, she explained and reasoned that I should already know that since she lived in Virginia with all of you she called me to ask me so how long have you been pregnant? she had sensed it over the many miles because of a change in the wind then i discovered that Killy knew i was pregnant too but that I didn't know so i pretended i knew and laughed insincerely that I knew for weeks already THEN later that day I got fired from my waitressing job because of gossiping and as I was ready to go home a really nice asian guy one of those ultra hip super souped car jag guys parked ON TOP of my little car squashing it into the shape of a box i cried from having lost the job and felt bad for making the nice asian guy fell bad so i took my baby to a petting zoo which was the best petting zoo in the world because it had a whole slew of llamas to pet and a big yard full of kissing cows yep - that's right - cows that, instead of mooing made BIG WET kissing sounds so loud that sometimes it came out sounding like a high pitched squeak and then - these cows looked like something that dr. Seuss would draw anyway the baby and i went through the zoo and ended up at my old bosses house (Don was the baby's second godfather) where we ran into quickly upon seeing a six foot rabbit in the back yard who really wanted to get into the moon so my boss shares a trick from the 60s with us this time, it was barbara ann and the baby and me hanging out at Don's house he showed us how to take essential oils  and rub them on our gums for a REALLY stunning, natural high with no side effects (except for a dry mouth) and it was good for the baby too! SO there we were when all of a sudden the cops busted in and arrested Don and Adolph (I don't know how Adolph got in there) for being Hector Molesters hmmmm so barbara was confused and argued  ineffectively to release don and adolph but the cops wouldn't have any of it i finally got her to stop talking as i saw that this was just working against us and i let the cops do their thing but just before they left i pleaded to their common sense which i realized they totally lacked when they insisted on arresting don and adolph and they took them away and barbara ann, the baby and i were left in don's house afraid to go outside because of the six foot rabbit who kept looking at the moon  then i woke up

       I was contacted by Reebok a little while back and we shared some correspondence as to me being possibly interested in them and them possibly being interested in me.  So after typing back and forth and getting a basic comfort established, they asked me out on a date.  So, They still have to book the tickets, I am flying out to Boston to go and have an interview. This is pretty cool. I have never been flown anywhere for buisness, other then once for my brother, but that kinda doesn't count.   So whatever happens is whatever, but I'ma get a free trip to Boston out of it.  I asked them to provide me with several escorts, seeing as how I get so lonely at night in big strange cities.

        Amazing Image Uploaded  Colin, that soccer playing image is great.  It reminds me of all the times I beat you to the ball and headed it spectacularly into the goal.  Also,  I noticed that you tried to upload a  .psd  (photoshop?)  file.  The Amazing Image Uploader only digests web viewable images, such as  jpgs, gifs and pngs.  If you try to feed it other kinds of files, the poor beast will suffer horrible indigestion.

        Carol loses a job, Carol finds a job   Carol's recent brush with unemployment was a real rollercoaster ride. We've been making so many plans that her sudden lay off was a real blow: what  about a montessori school for the baby? what about a house? what about paying off our debt? what about fixing the cavalier?  All of this was thrown into limbo for exactly three days.   3 Days!   The same day she was laid off, Carol went into professional job hunting mode. She updated her resume the same day and called her old headhunter, MK Personnel, to set things in motion. Carol also had submitted her resume to a number of places she saw on  urlLink Monster.com .  Interview on Wednesday (second day after having gotten laid off), and then offered the job late Thursday (day three)... i was speechless and she was gloating all day - and beaming. She deserved to; she even managed to get a pretty good raise to go along with it.  I think it's a good idea to have a "Sorry you lost your job but you found a new one so quickly!" party this weekend?

       Well it definatley has been an interesting week. I got the Sd-10 used it all day Today at the Driskell where I rented it out to Mark. Then my brother bought my Canon s40. we sold the s40 because liz wanted a smaller camera for her. So we went to bestbuy and combined her best buy gift cards and my brothers cash and we bought her an sd-10 the canon one. and the WOW is because Adolph's repost of the dog shot is a whole lot more yellow than the one I posted. at least on my computer it is. hmm. Well I will be sure to post some images soon.

       . . . Or it is new to me at least. I forgot where I learned this, maybe Killy or Taggart showed me. I took some pics in the normal collage technique of click and pan. Then I took a step to the side and took the same pictures. Once on the computer, I masked the telephone pole that was in front of me, put the second collage of images behind the first and scooted them around to match (mostly). Voila, the telephone pole disappeared (mostly). Unfortunately, I only adjusted horizontal and not vertical, so the arms of the traffic lights are still visible.

       It has been a long day. I first have to apologize to Adolph and Paul.... for waiting up so long and then Mark and I never showing up. Yesterday Mark and I were shooting the Mercedes-Benz dealership on the corner of Highway 6 and 59 South in Houston. We left Austin late and made it to the dealership on time, but we had to forgo a trip to Adolph's house. We shot and shot and shot until about 1:15 a.m. Twelve Shots and all. Mark at that point decided he wanted to go home. He later began to regret his decision because not 15 min out of town we began driving through the worst fog I have ever seen in my life. Visability was about 25 ft.  Seriously. We were both freaking out. Mark being his stubborn self and returning to Houston decided he would forge on. Thinking the Fog would let up. 3 hours later we were still on the edge of our seats driving a very dangerous 70 mph. We were going to die, I was convinced. Well we made it home despite Marks best efforts at around 4:30 a.m. I crept inside the house and scared the living daylights out of Liz and Bodi. Crawled into bed and slept till 10:30. Spent the rest of the day calling people. Went to a meeting with Action Figure. Then went over to Mark's house to see if my camera had arrived. Picked it up took it home.

       I'm back in Portland. All in all it's good to be home. Life is funny. I was just in Texas yesterday. And this morning I was once again scribbling the likenesses of my fellow public transiters into my little book. Chella has two dance classes today. Hannah starts up fencing tomorrow. there are a million things to get done. Laura has a show going up in March and another in April. We are building frames and getting slides made and getting promo stuff printed and organizing play dates for the kids and organizing the homeschooling co-op. Vacation was short and somehow......ya'll remember Tron. When they are on that shell like boat/plane and there is that energy pulse that is caught in front of the ship. Alot of shit to get done.   Television is a waste of time. If you find yourself in front of it, remember, you are going to die someday and this is the one chance you have got to kick ass, there is so much to do that is real.  colin.

           best cereal ever.    One of the first ready-to-eat cereal products ever made available to the public, Grape-Nuts was first introduced in 1897. Made of wheat and malted barley, Grape-Nuts was so named because its inventor, Charles William Post, said that grape sugar was formed during the baking process and described the cereal as having a nutty flavor. Post was a pioneer in introducing and making popular cereal, a food product that today has become a standard breakfast staple.

        Weekend In San Antonio    urlLink   I just got back from a lovely weekend in San Antonio.  The highlight of the trip was the amazing sunday morning gospel mass we attended at the Mount Zion First Baptist Church.  The preacher was incredible, and his sermon kicked so much holy ass that I thought the roof was going to blow off of the church-hall.  Since it was a memorial service, we were also lucky eneogh to hear a few words from the Rev. Claude Black Jr, one of San Antonio's outstanding citizens...  The couple I was visiting also took me out to the Blue Star to see Sky Patterson's (a relation of theirs) latest show.  Some of the compositions were pretty interesting, and the colors were pleasing.  I had never been to Blue Star, is that where San Antonio has First Friday?  To finish off the day we went hiking out at Friederich Park.  It is a nice little hike in the shrinking Hill Country.  We were attacked by a bear but I fought it off with my pocket knife.  I was dissapointed not to have had a chance to see the Flynns, but maybe we can all get together for  Flynn Fest 2004  this summer?

I guess that is part of being a grown up. Learning to let someone elses needs surpass your own.     The girls and I are going to eat lunch with my grandma today at her retirement city. Let her show the greatgrandkids off to the other craggy old folks.   Tomorrow we once again engage in air travel and leave the sun for colder and wetter places.   It is lovely to see the live oak trees, and the sun so big and the sky so blue.  Come and vist.   Colin.

        A Relaxing Weekend   Friday, 6 p.m.   Walked in the door to my room, pulled off my shoes and shirt, slipped under a thin blanket and slept.   Saturday, 14 hrs. later   I woke up at 8:30 or so, but didn't actually get out of the house till sometime around 2:30. We had a big, slow breakfast; we cleaned our room; did laundry; and put the kitchen back together. By the time adolfo iv had woken up from his nap, we were ready to head out.  Got a haircut, and headed to the children's museum. Adolfo iv headed straight for the bubble machine (as usual) and mommy and daddy eyed the snack bar. Eventually, we all ate an early dinner there: pb&j sandwich, one chicken ceasar salad, and a bag of cheetos.     We ended up at adolph's for a diaper change, but ended up taking the train downtown for coffee.      Sunday, another early rise, but late start   House hunting in the area just north of the north loop aroound ella, t.c. jester, 34th, and 43rd streets. We drove around a good while till adolfo iv started getting restless. We ended up taking him to CherryHurst Park just off of Fairview. He climbed, swung, ran, and played till he was worn out.     One last stop before we head home for a long nap: lunch.

          It was pretty nice. The train stop is just over 500 paces from my office. The picture above is the scene at the Fannin St. Museum Station. When I arrived they had just dragged a car off the tracks. It was a car turning left in front of the train. I don't think it was a legal left since the train follows the lights, although in benefit-of-the-doubt land, I supposed you'd have to ask if the train ran the red.  Notes: Dryden TMC stop has a Starbucks and a Chipotle and a Subway. I'm certain that they get mobbed during lunch, I can catch them on the way home. I need to find a dry cleaners on the route. I like my dry cleaners, the guy there knows me by name (most of the time), but it is over there on Almeda, not in my commute path at all. &nbsp In terms of the number of people using the train, I think that a lot of people are probably like me, you have an investment in your commute and it takes time to change it. You have to make sure it (a.) works and is reliable, (b.) doesn't take too much more time, (c.) has good stores and services on the route, and (d.) probably a lot of other stuff I am forgetting. If it has taken me an entire week to get out of my ruts and try the train, I'm certain a lot of other people are eye-balling it for the plunge.

       Hey ya'll,   I am still here in Portland. We were supposed to leave yesterday. Cancelled. We were supposed to leave today. Cancelled. We are supposed to leave tomorrow. The news says that the airport is closed untill 5:00 am tomorrow. Our flight is supposed to leave at 6:38 am. So it may turn out that we do not come to Texas at all.   In all the years that I have lived up here in the Far reaches of the continent, it has only snowed twice. Both times it has been meerly for decorative purposes. Not functional snow. "Gone the next day" kinda snow.  We are currently blanketed.  At first it was the sort of rare blessing that you dream of. The Grey sky takes on a benevolent tone and the tiny crystalls descend in a wonderfull swirling flock. People you never even knew lived next door to you emerge from there television comas and step out into the world. I say this because, we often take walks around our neighborhood and we are the only people on the streets, ever, save for some disgrunteled dog walking units. But each and every house we walk past is illuminated by the blue glow of mass media. We are losing sight of reality as a society because of our own ability to let ourselves be entertained by the creative products of superficial greed.  How much space in our collective minds can be filled with bullshit. Tangent.   The wonderful snow.  We walked for hours around in it. snow balls and a crunching sound underfoot. having all of the forgotten spots covered over to sleep for a bit. everything new and hopeful.   The next day the snows cousin showed up.   Freezing rain.  At first it was interesing. Glass ball bearings falling by the thousands falling from the sky, and hitting me in the eye. so the "awe of change" wears off and all the happy people retire into the houses for hot choclate and jocking for position over the heater vents. All the while the ice falls in an innocent audible snaredrum roll.  There is a two inch thick shell that completely encases my car. It is actually really interesting to pull large pieces of this off the vehicle and attempt, jigsaw style,  to reassemble a hollow replica of the car.    POINT BEING. We are unsure if we will make it to Texas at all. So I am writing long-wind-ed-ly to say that there shall be no wonder twin power meeting. No "FORM OF A FRIENDLY GATHERING!"  No "SHAPE OF LAUGHING PEOPLE."  ALAS, to you my good friends, I cannot tell to you how much my want to bask in your pressence. And how much I will miss this lost chance.  OH well.  Screw you all. I don't need friends............I've got my army of snow and ice to keep me company.  c.

        The sabattical   1.7.04 - The last day of a seemingly long vacation (10:40 p.m.)  The grand total time away from my little family was three and a half days; i missed them terribly. The first few hours were nice, but once i got to todd's house and lay my small frame in between the sheets of the king sized guest-room bed, i was aching for their fragrant bodies next to mine.  It was after a nice salad dinner, a couple of beers, and some conversation that we ended up back at todd's house. We got high and played a few rounds of ghost recon. Maybe it was the drugs, but the game seemed much harder.  I had troubled sleep. Aside from my absent family I had an overactive dream; not the kind that leave you with details, but the kind that leaves you with a bad taste in your brain, as if you've just had a taco full of cow brains.  I made todd some creamy oatmeal and coffee (well, actually, todd brewed the coffee.). We ended up meeting taggart and liz at El Sol... before heading to san marcos where i would be left at Carl's place for the remainder of my stay in central texas.  The first day was mostly settling in. We pulled into carl's around 1. We met carl's roommate, david; todd and carl had a brief talk about working on a new website. todd left soon afterward and i settled into the studio, where i would be sleeping. I unpacked myself and looked outside: cloudy. Really cloudy. The kinda cloudy that would rain on you the second you settled yourself outside.  After i had copied over some Imacon tutorials that carl insist i watch before using the scanner, i pulled out my book and went for a walk around 'the grounds'. The light was flat, grey and uninspiring. I read and walked at the same time. I walked along his fence. I found a poorly lit shot, but figured that i had to shoot something. I pulled out my camera and shot -- slowly and deliberately.  I got maybe half a roll.  more to come...

         urlLink Ottmar Liebert: Mixed feelings about Garageband:  Why would a child attempt to spend years learning a musical instrument when s/he could be making music with GarageBand instantly? It takes about 2-3 years of practicing to make music on any 'real" instrument. For most intents and purposes, the musical instrument is a rich interface for music creation. The idea isn't that computers or new technology to supplant traditional instruments, a la those 1980's synthesizers worn like guitars; the idea is eliminate all the expensive stuff preventing you from simply accomplishing a creative task. True, a Mac and assorted ya-ya aren't free, and GarageBand doesn't compete with the high-end stuff, but it is relatively inexpensive and it looks like it will do a good job.  &nbsp; I'm wondering if Garageband will support the transfer of its working files, so that one person could do something, and then another person far away work on top of that, and so on and so on, to create new colaborative efforts that couldn't happen if you had to get everyone in the same room....

        This evening marks the first time I have ever video chatted with anyone. This isn't a new technology really, I followed  urlLink CUseeMe software  as it developed years ago, I think before PowerMacs were around. This evening, I finally talked to someone over the internet.   In some ways, even though it has been around for years, it is still a technology in its infancy. The camera is an add-on cludge to the computer, even though it does have an elegant clamp-on perch and a short, non-tangly cable into the firewire port. But compared to text messaging, video and audio messaging is still limited. For example, it doesn't record the conversation as with text, and if it did, it would take up vast amounts of space on my hard drive (relatively). More importantly, perhaps, is that I do not have a physiological vocabulary that adds value to the video conversation other than "hey I can sit here or I can walk around with the computer and talk to you at the same time." In the larger scheme of things, motion pictures themselves have only been around for a hundred years or so; with that in mind if doesn't seem strange that my physical expressive vocabulary is limited. Sure, people have been watching each other talk since before there were written words, but motion picture transmision is far different--it rewards a different set of movements and lighting, which reflects the its gamut of experience is more limited than that of live in person.  I wonder if my kids will live in a world where one's physical vocabulary will be as important in communications as one's verbal?

       Hi to the folks out there in bloggerland.  Once again the troop of mine will sweep like migrating geese, with much honking and flapping, onto the home of my parents in San Antonio. On the 11th day of this month I have informed my father that some of my friends might come by for some visiting and merry making.    If one such as yourself, that being the one in possesion of the eyes that are reading, would like to come and admire my offspring and clasp hands in much shaking and a bit of laughing and comparing of gut sizes and amount of hair and the like. Feel free to inquire of me directions to the house of my Parents. Paul of Mercado and the Duke and Duchess of Chavez have said in one form or another that they are to be expected. A of Dolph, you are welcome. Tag of Gurt are as well. Todd of the Red and hard working, I shall expect, if you are not working, to see you.    Blagh blagh blaghgity blagh. so forth and so on.  contact me directly for directions.  flynncolin@yahoo.com

         urlLink A Republican Nader? - The third-party candidate Democrats want and need. By Timothy Noah :  "Political scientists argue about whether Ross Perot's 19 percent of 1992's popular vote put Bill Clinton in the White House?it hinges on whether you think Perot voters would have otherwise voted Democratic, Republican, or not at all?but Chatterbox, who covered that race for the Wall Street Journal, always felt at the gut level that Perot's appeal was more powerful to potential supporters of George H.W. Bush. Exit polls contradict Chatterbox's gut; they showed Perot voters splitting their preferences fairly equally between Clinton and Bush. But a survey by Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg found that Perot voters had a 'largely Republican voting history.' The 2000 election, of course, was so absurdly close that just about anything--including Ralph Nader's 3 percent of the popular vote, which otherwise would probably have gone to Al Gore--can be called a determining factor."   As a two time Perot voter I've always wondered how he stacked up against Nader in 2000. Interestingly, Slate quotes the same "pollster" as Nader.   urlLink Infoplease.com  sez: "He garnered 19% of the popular vote in '92, and 8% in '96, testimony to voters' disillusionment with the traditional two-party system."

         urlLink Why Ralph? : According to the exit polls conducted by Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, fully 25% of his votes came from Republicans, 38% from Democrats, and the remainder from people who would not have voted.  No other American leader can be credited with such broad appeal across the divides of our polarized nation.   Hmmmm, given Nader's relatively slim plurality, it would seems unfair to characterize his appeal as broad; it would seem more like "narrow appeal across the divides . . . ."

         urlLink Mac 911 Weblog: It's the Standard, Stupid :  "The same people who buy inexpensive players are also purchasing music online from sources other than the iTunes Music Store and thereby amassing collections of music that are incompatible with the iPod. What are the odds that these people will become iPod owners if their music collections wont play on it?" Feel free to enter your single digit answer here."   I think that the economic model the assertion is made on is flawed in that the larger part of most people's digital music collections is composed of DRM-free MP3 files encoded from their libraries of compact disks. In the future this may or may not change. The early adopters or the second wave of adopters have certainly taken to music downloads, but there still exist many technical hurdles before non-computer savvy people are able to download music and feel comfortable doing it. The other half of the Apple's loss leader in the iTunes Music Store is the iTunes music management software, which like the music download service is the industry leader both in sales and design. More than any other system, it stands a chance of enabling non-technical people to enjoy how their personal computer can enhance their audio experience.

The program was created in Power Point and only has photos and text, no movies.  The way I burned the CD was just by dragging the files onto the CD icon and then dragging the CD icon to the black and yellow burn icon at the bottom of the screen (where the trash usually is) ...

       Baby was asleep this morning, slumbering and dreaming away the wee hours of the morn while Daddy showered and dressed and then Mommy following suit.  Daddy makes coffee, baby still sleeps, pink pudgy lips drooping open towards the bed where he rests his fat cheek, he doesn't need a pillow.  Mommy holds baby close, humming and singing his special baby song.  Baby's fingers spread like wings and then curl like eyelashes to rest again on the warm bed.  Otherwise he doesn't stir.  In the kitchen, life bubbles in the coffee maker, Daddy zooms in and out with last minute gatherings.  Lunch is already packed for the week, cooked up late last night by Mommy.  Papas con Huevos and a serving of oatmeal for breakfast.  Chicken, squash and rice for lunch, Sweet Rice Atole and diced fruit for desert.  Baby still slumbers.  Mommy quickly dresses, then softly changes baby's diaper, wet with last night's feedings.  Quietly and carefully Mommy changes baby out of his PJs and into his jeans and soccer shirt.  Socks and shoes follow. Baby doesn't wake, he stretches a little, then drops off into dreamland once more. Finally, in Daddy's arms and near the door, baby's eyes open slowly, first one, then the other, flutter into awakefulness.  He smiles. We open the door and baby looks out in to the still slumbering world. The dew is still in the air.

        hello Amber.  What OS are you running on your mac? One of the early versions of 10? if so that is most likely the problem. We had the exact same problem, which was not specific to PowerPoint, when we first upgraded. it seems that the original burning software made discs that did not play nice with Windows, most notably Windows 98.  Some options to consider : 1. upgrade your OS, or, 2. pick up a copy of the  urlLink Burnz  software adolph mentioned. Either of those shoudl do the trick and provide hours of PowerPointing Pleasure.

       Amber, (1.) Was the presentation originally made in PowerPoint, or was it made in something else, like Keynote? (2.) Does the PowerPoint contain anything other than pictures (i.e. movies)? (3.) How did you burn the CD? I've noticed that if you make a disk image first and then burn, then Win98 computers can't see the disk, but if you burn though the Finder, then it works fine. I've been using  urlLink Burnz  to make disks now though, because it offers increased compatibility options. Burnz is free for the first 10 disks and $12.50 for use thereafter. (4.) If you can get to the presentation computer ahead of time, make a really simple PowerPoint, burn it to disk and see if you can get it to run.

       So I went to the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens today to give a 6-hour comprehensive presentation all about tropical plants -- and then, it happened -- that nightmare event that so far I had only dreamed about and feared --  my power point files didn't open!!  I had saved the slide shows as .ppt files on my Apple computer and then burned them onto a disc -- when I then tried to open them on the garden's IBM lap-tops, the CD-ROM icon showed up, along with the file folder called "Presentations," but when I clicked on the file folder to get to the files, a message came up saying "Folder is empty" ... so I tried opening Power Point and then opening the files from within the program and got the message "Unable to access files ..."    I thought I had made a mistake in burning the CD ... but when I got home, I was able to open the disc and open the files on my computer --- does anyone know what went wrong???  Please help!!

         I'm working hard filling up the new 160 gig hard drive to make sure it doesn't have any bad spots, unlike the last one. It is hard to fill up that much space!   Nader  , one the one hand it is cynical to say, "Nader, don't run because you will gurantee the the current president is the next president," on the other hand you have to wonder if Nader doesn't like being the opposition so much that he would like to see the ruin of us all so he can keep on saying "I've been telling you so!" I was thinking about this last week and wondering, "did the Greens have a vote at some point to select Nader as their presidential candidate?" Was it just decided in some smoke filled room? (You know the kind of smoke.) Is Nader ver.2 (Now without bothering with this Green Party stuff) just a Lyndon La Rouche perennial candidate without a hope, just there to get 15 minutes every 4 years? Whatever happened too all that "building the Green Party" stuff that had to do with electing local Green Party candidates? I haven't heard of Nader stopping by to stump for any around here. In the larger picture, his candidacy can be seen as a criticism of main-line Democratic Party corporate corruption, I guess. But if most main-line Democratic candidates are now saying something about trade agreements that benefit corporations more than citizens, why wouldn't you get gung-ho and get a place at the table? RFID coupled with GPS, wireless networking and an Amazon.com style search and find system would be the most fantastic thing for libraries and bookstores. Imagine a library where nothing was shelved in order, only the order in which it came in or was reshuffled. Maybe little bookshelf crawling robots to fetch far-away titles too. It would be like those research libraries where librarians fetch the stuff for you, you only have access to the card catalogue and wait at a study carol and turn in a little card with what you want and then they fetch it. I'm not certain if that would make for a quality retail experience though...

       Well.    as is my only commentary, no sparkling blurbs on technical gazidtry, and reformatting systems to realign perspectives on geo political party assertions.   To comment on Ambers comments. I am frustrated by the work situation. mostly out of my own inability to grab it by the throat and take a stand on self created ground. I still am schleping to the check of corporate bohemoths to spend my time and hard fought creativity on the production of useless crap. creating yet another strategy to extract the cash from the pockets of the people. Hey who wants a pair of fucking shoes? How about some cool? we got that over here. Not convinced? well if you start to see through that bullet proof ad campaign, I'll just come up with graphic information that's composed on an abstract emotional level to disorient your scepticism. Yes this is a bit acidic. Yes I do feel the slave. Yes I am only as much a slave as I let myself be.    But once again, I leave "work" and make my way through a conglomeration of other peoples intentions and directions stacked on each other to build this coral of commerce and wind my way walking through street of neighbors that do not speak to each other. What happened to a friend in my path smiling? Finally I arrive at a door.    I open this door and inside is something wholly and completely different to me as nothing I have ever known. I am once again a simple part of things true and real and simple. Light comes from my hand switching on that light and lighting that candle and kissing that cheek and wipping that tear and hearing that laughter. sitting to a table with these three girls who wait each day for me to come home. presenting me with a day full of difference. Emotional expression that has no place in that place that I spend so many heart beats and breaths. But in this house I know why I do that fighting and striving for those monies. I am still so much in awe of how much I do not know. How much one can never know. How I shall stand, and learn as best I can to do so in a manner with truth. And build this family with my wife and my children.  fuck yeah.

        SD-10: Fun with Perspective  So here is another 'waiting for Carol to pick me up' shot. Here, I shot the new research bldg from across the street around 4:50 P.M. today. I'm kinda new at this fixing perspective thing, so bear with me as i struggle through it. You'll notice the second bldg looks a little keystoned at the bottom right, not to mention the distortion in the line of windows lodged in that pink 'capital' limestone; i should have pulled out the bottom anchor a little more to fix this...

       You know, I forgot about how I still write what a lot of people read. I guess it is a mark of something when you're doing something and don't really realize exactly what you are doing so much as just doing it. I used to write a column every week in the university paper, then that zine we did and I thought that I had stopped. In reality, I just found another publication, I send out over 12,000 emails every couple of weeks for people to read. In the last one, there were over 6,000 unique opens and 12,000 total opens. The difference between the two numbers comes from people opening it up more than once or forwarding it on to other people who open it up.  Of course, I'm not just writing whatever comes into my head, or following whatever spurious leads disgruntled professors or staff feed me. Now a days it is a fight for focus and relevance, trying to take all the stuff that the place I works for wants to communicate and formulate it so that people read it. It is a different challenge, and something I forgot I was doing until just now.

       In our family, Anthony will be the Mr. Mom, while I go out every day to earn a living ... of course, he earns his living from home already .. but having a Junior/Juniorette to look after will add a whole new dimension to his work day -- I wonder just how much work he will actually be able to do between tending to baby ... and, of course, like Carol and every other mom who has to leave her child, I'm sure I will also feel those parting pangs and envy my man for having so much bonding time ... and he will maybe  envy me for having the freedom to walk out the door every day at 7 a.m. ... life is so complicated ... it's interesting reading that so many of us are experiencing these things at around the same time.  I like Carol and Killy's solution of facing life's obstacles with a song ...  Colin, maybe what defines you as a man is not so much the day to day grind of earning The Living but the gradual creation of something larger:  life and dreams  and song and the hope and love and promise you see reflected in your children's  eyes when they look at you, the one who makes it all possible.  Life viewed in the near may look like muddled stains on the floor, but viewed over months or years it becomes a multi-colored landscape of breathtaking complexity  and richly layered meanings, of unanticipated turns and forks in the road, of valleys  that go on and on, only to be capped by glorious peaks, and of interconnected threads  that lead you to become the person you were always meant to be.  Things never change.  Then, unexpectedly, they do.

       Paul and I are already using a version assistive technology called CVS, or Concurrent Version Control. I haven't spent enough time learning about VersionCue, but it strikes me as a similar technology with Adobe's products in mind. Paul and I use CVS to make sure we don't step on each other's work.   CVS does a number of handy things: 1. It acts as a central repository for our collective work. 2. It keeps a history of the versions of each file in the collective work. 3. If Paul and I are editing the same file at different places, it merges the two different changes. 4. If Paul and I modify the same portion of the same file in incompatible ways, it lets us know that we have a conflict that we need to work out.   I don't plan to every work on a web project without it, because it keeps you safe with very little overhead. That said, it is a bit of a pain to set up if you aren't familiar with it and the command line.   Likewise, I am looking forward to using VersionCue. I am a little wary of it as it looks like a pretty proprietary solution. What if it goes the way of that mysterious "Publish and Subscribe. . ." or OpenDoc technology in Mac OS 7? Still I think the key sentence is:  Say good-bye to awkward file names like "brochure_1," "brochure_2," or even "brochure_final_final.psd."  Please, please Adobe, deliver us from nonversioning filesystem evil!

       Word brother, I hear what your saying about the manlihood of earning the income. The fucking shit is, I can earn a living but does that compose the whole of me as a man. sometimes it seems like the only thing that defines me as male or man is this function. All the functions of attracting the female and reproducing have been taken care of, I have proved my potency, so now all that seems to remain is that of being an earner. It's fucked up, especially when there are more then your own thoughts and feelings involved. Kids take all situations and add such dimension.

        The 2nd Night (misery!) and and the 3rd Morning  On a totally normal night with no interruptions we got in the door at just before 7:00 P.M. Adolfo had refused to nap yesterday. He was exhausted, but he was also sooooo angry at carol (both of us, really), but he also wanted to BE with his mama so badly. He was crying and whining hard the whole time. We figured he was just exhausted since he hadn't napped, so carol took him to bed.  He fell asleep, but then woke up crying. then, he fell asleep again; then, woke up crying....  (repeat till 11:30)  Carol was pretty frustrated. She never really had dinner = angry/frustrated wife.  @ 11:30 the baby fully woke up. He was endlessly crying. Nothing would settle him. We thought maybe he was sick in some way or bothered by a diaper rash...nuthin'...no rubbing ears, no extraordinary gas, no red rash on the behind, nuthin'...  He got down off the bed and in the lamplight, threw a tantrum as never before. Carol and i were stunned. All we could do was watch him. He shook his head as he stood against the bed and hit the side of the bed with his little fists. Then, he threw himself down on the floor and started kicking. He got up and did it again....  After letting this go on for about a minute, i tried to pick him up. He would have none of me. Carol picked him up and he calmed down a bit. We tried to re-assure him, love him, but it just didn't matter what we did.  Finally, we did the only thing we could do....we sang.  We sang, 'Down by the Bay' and 'The Rock Candy Mountain' quietly, and with that ... he slept, but restlessly. Mommy had to bear the full brunt of his restlessness throughout the night. Poor Carol. I should get her another massage.  At one point in the evening i had consulted 'the book' ( What to Expect the First Year ) about Separation Anxiety. Apparently, this is a pretty common occurance for mtoher's who are full time workers. The child is away from her all day and at night sees sleeping as another 'loss' of the mother's attention and time, so he fights it.  This is hard to bear as much as a reality as it is. It is at these times that i berate myself especially hard for not being the 'breadwinner' of my little family. Inevitably I question my 'manlihood' (whatever that is). Why can't a let my wife be home with my son? What more can i do?

          The 2nd Day & a quick poster comment  Today, he knew. He knew that when his mother put him down she would leave so he kept her close. The first time she tried to put him down he clutched at her -- hard. So she waited a bit. Eventually she got him down, but he kept her close, showing her the chairs and some of the other kids. He clamored to be picked up again, so she picked him up. Then, Bernie (teacher #2) came in. Adolfo iv gives Bernie a kiss-kiss. Carol quickly transfers adolfo to her arms and says 'bye-bye!' His face explodes and contorts to what we call his 'poochie' face. Carol walks out the door and as she looks back through the windows of the classroom only to see his face red and wet with tears.  She called me right after she left. She wasn't crying this time, just a little sad.  I would think that posters like this still exist, but the majority of us don't visit too many free clinics anymore, which is where (i think) a lot of these sorts of posters are hung.

        Adolfo IV Goes To School     I am more worried for carol than adolfo. She called me from the North Loop this morning, crying.  "Babe, how'd he do?"  " -*sob*- -*sniff*- He's....fine... -*sob*- -*sniff*-.... He didn't even notice i was -*sob*- gone..."  We spent our entire Sunday afternoon getting ready for this week. We (adolfo and i) began the morning with an episode of  urlLink Jakers , the cutest show on television. Then, once mom woke up, we went out to Taquitos (paul's favorite mex breakfast joint outside the loop) for breakfast. He ate about half a papas con huevo taco and some orange juice before he clamored to be let out of his seat. Luckily for me, i'm a fast eater.  The rest of the day, carol cooked. All in total she prepared four full sized meals - all neatly sealed in tupperware containers for the rest of the week:  1. Spaghetti - this, of course, is too simple a name. It is spaghetti with a mild italian sausage, chunky garden sauce (ragu), cubed zuchinni, and yellow squash.  2. Chicken and Rice - This is one of adolfo's favorites. Rice cooked in fresh tomatoes and onion, with chicken wings boiled in. The meat is then stripped off the bone for a soft yummy meal.  3. Mediterranean Black Bean Soup - I think she just followed the instructions outside the bean mix, but it's still a hearty soup.  4. Oatmeal - Quaker Oat oatmeal with condensed milk and cinnamon sticks.  Adolfo's first lunch will be the Chicken and Rice with seedless red grapes (all of them cut in half.) See his  urlLink schedule here.   If anything, he will be extremely well fed.

        if the SD-10 makes movie files that end in .AVI you can import them directly into iMovie without converting them. i am pretty sure you can do that with .MOV files as well, but adolph generally knows what he is talking about.

        Liz,  Typically still cameras do not have a video direct to computer mode. To put a camera into iMovie, you have to do a few things: (1.) make movie on camera, (2.) transfer movie file from camera to computer, (3.) change mpeg or mov file from camera into a iMovie-ready dv file with Quicktime Pro, and (4.) import the .dv file into iMovie. On high-end digital SLR's, like the SD-10, the Firewire interface is for special software meant to operate the camera and move picture files. Most do not even take short movies since the shutter remains closed over the sensor. Your results may vary.

        Walking  I caught this shot one weekend morning as we were walking around the block towards Lost Creek Park.     Here's the iphoto info:     I had it set on the 'Vivid'  setting; other canon owners will know what i'm talking about. Hence, the extraordinarily blue sky (it WAS pretty nice outside, however). I'm a little puzzled about the max aperture (f/3) line, tho. Can anyone explain this? The exposure for this shot was f/5.6, the exposure for other darker shots has been 2.8. I don't know where this f/3 comes from.  I worked it in photoshop. I brought it in and created a duplicate layer. I used an levels adjustment layer to brighten the tree (and the sky with it) and then selected all the branches using the wand. I then, created a mask with the branch selection, and inversed it and painted over it with the paintbrush with the opacity set to about 30%, bringing out the branches a little at a time.  Then, just for kicks, i put a diffuse glow on the branches to make it pretty.

        Coffee Morning  I wish i had remembered to bring my mmc card reader so i could have included a picture right as i'm posting this. Carol and i woke up around 8 with the baby, changed his diaper and put him in front of the t.v. (jay jay the jet plane) so we could get ourselves together and prepare some breakfast.  After a big breakfast of eggs, rice, pancakes, apple juice and milk we cleaned up and headed out of the house for some coffee (we ran out of regular coffee about two days ago and have consistently forgotten to pick some up at kroger.)  It's a Grind is a franchise out of California that sits in an 'island' strip mall that sits in the parking lot of another strip mall. It's a nice enough place and it's got a nice wi-fi connection. Adolfo iv is running around like a fiend. He's also enjoying an apple danish with his apple juice.

        Kroger Kids  I went to the local Kroger for baby shampoo, Q-tips, deodorant, and a new set of wipies for the baby. On my way out i saw they had itunes pepsi's in the fridge at the checkout counter. I started pulling pepsi's out of the fridge and tipping them looking for winners.  As i was looking, a pimply teen came around and said, "....i already bought all the winners. There aren't any in that fridge..."  Ha!

        SugarDaddies of the World  Whomever has the extra dough to purchase  urlLink this  will be have first pick at training videos. I'm sorry, i would love to buy  urlLink it  myself, but i simply don't have the money right now.  The demo version worked fine. It compressed the first 30 mins of an already ripped dvd down to about 590MB without burping. I think it would be pretty nice if we could fit two 'videos' per dvd; although, trying to squeeze an entire dvd onto one cd is tempting too.

        Option Period - OVER  Well, the option period is done with. We have come to an agreement on price & repairs. The next step is getting through the long process with the bank. I've already done a good amount of shopping for insurance; i think i've found who i want to carry my policy.  The next big step is connecting all the dots; the dots being the  urlLink title company ,  urlLink the bank , and the  urlLink insurance company .  Everyone has to get everyone else's name and fax number.  There's a tremendous amount of paper pushing (i would imagine) going on behind the scenes.  One morning recently I heard the current housing numbers; If i remember correctly, they were surprisingly robust compared to speculations. Going through this process i can see how this is easily an economic indicator: so many people involved, so many companies (realtors, inspectors, lawyers, insurance agents, brokers, contractors, loan officers, appriasers...) and they all receive their piece of the pie at closing.  Fees, Fees, Fees..... title writing fee, money wiring fee, lawyer fees, appraisal fee....etc....  So i am being a good American, a good citizen ...

        The Good News Is.....  I figured out how to copy the Total Training dvds!   The Bad News Is....   There is 7 gigs worth of data on one disk, so either we're going to have to get a burner that will burn two layers on one disk, or get a REALLY big hard drive. I've got a forty gig at home that i can clear off...  The Photoshop CS total training has a total of eight disks. Illustrator, InDesign, and GoLive each have two (i think). Then, there's another disk explaining VersionCue.  anyone else got some extra space?

        Option Period - Day 7 (Tuesday)  I spent this day shopping around for homeowners insurance. I had to send over the inspection report so they could run the quote. AMICA was the most competative quote. If all goes well, i'll probably go with them. (Referred to me by my former financial consultant, Howard Peel).

        Option Period - Day 6 (cont'd)  Steve, the inspector greeted me with a firm handshake and an apology for running a little bit late. We knocked on the door and the sellers answered the door - both of them AND their two year old son.  I wasn't expecting this. I thought for sure that they would leave the house so it could be inspected, mainly cause this is probably one of the more upsetting things for a seller to go through: a man running through your house telling the buyer what is wrong with it, ultimately resulting in necessary repairs and/or a reduction in value. There wasn't much we could do...  Steve strapped on knee pads & his utility belt and got straight to work. He turned on all the water, crawled around the attic, stepped on the roof, pulled out electric outlets, checked the uptake and other miscellaneous crawl spaces...  I followed him for the most part, but took a few detours to familiarize myself a little more with the place. The place was cute. I could see my family living there. I could see adolfo running in the backyard; i could see carol cooking in the kitchen....  The termite inspector and her assistant showed up. After about 45 mins of poking around, they found live termites in the front of the house. Treatment necessary.  I was making my own list of repairs i could do; taking down the trouble spots on the landscaping; making a list of tools that i didn't have...  All the while the sellers were quickly trying to respond to things the inspector would point out. Bulbs were missing in several outlets, so they would scramble to get bulbs from their garage; One outlet had a hot wire on it, so the husband ran off to Home Depot and bought a new plug to replace it. It went on like this for a couple of hours.  Eventually their agent showed up, summarily ignored me, shook the hand of my inspector handed him a card, and wisked his clients out of the house. This all happend in the blink of an eye. I'm sure he told them to not be there for the inspection...who knows why they stayed.  We had the last hour to ourselves to check out the remainder of the house. I got a grand tour of all his findings all with digital photos...   Overall  - a nice old house that needs some repairs.  Most Necessary  - Termite Treatment, water heater replacement, air conditioner servicing, electrical grounding....   Total Time : 3 1/2 hours.

        Option Period - Day 6  I'm typing this out a full day later ....  I dropped carol off at work and adolfo iv off at school. He didn't go all that gracefully. I left quickly enough so i had enough of my heart left...  I drove around the neighborhood. I watched all the kids file into Scarbarough H.S., which is just two blocks down. Most of the kids were dropped off or were walking in from 43rd street. I pulled into Georgi st to see if any kids were filing out of mangum manor specifically ... i didn't notice any. I cruised the streets looking at lawns, noticing which properties had old people sitting out front (quite a few), finding all the outlets to mangum, antoine, and 43rd streets, and listening most importantly...  so wonderfully quiet.  I took a good long drive down antoine. Not a starbucks in sight. A lot of small businesses, which was nice. I saw a lot of mexican 'La Tapatia-esque' places, but none with any character to speak of.  I dropped by St. Ambrose Catholic Church and picked up a bulletin. It's right around the block from our place. I would guess it's somewhere between .5 and .75 mi from the house.  I arrived at the property at about 9:30. I parked across the street and gave myself some time to walk down the block. All the surrounding houses were clean and well kept. The yards were well trimmed and raked. There was no standing water anywhere on the street. ****I mention that cause Maru/Mike's new house had some putrid standing water on the street in front of their place several days after it had rained. It was the ONLY water down the entire block.****  I struck up a converstation with who may become my immediate neighbor. Her name was anna, 60, and she was staying with her parents who had become too old to really take care of themselves. Her father was standing at the garage just smiling. He couldn't see too well, apparently. She gave me the scoop on most of the neighbors, and on the immediate block: most of our neighbors are fairly old; some have small pets, but most don't. A woman across the street home schools her two boys (aged 14,9). An older gentleman across the street came out of his house and shuffled around his driveway talking to himself.  Anna gave me a smirk, "He talks to himself, but he's the sweetest man. He comes over and watches my parents from time to time. He also happens to be the yard man for the church..." The older man goes back and forth on his driveway and then disappears around the corner of his house.  "He's probably going to come over later and ask who you were..."  We talked about her yard and about the pear tree she just planted smack dab in the front yard. The 'seller's' Rottweiller poked it's head between a break in a fence plank and stared at us. She turned, and then gave me a look that told me she hated dogs....or, at least, that particular dog.  "Do YOU have any pets?" she asked. I just smiled and said no. At that point, my inspector pulled up....   (to be continued.....)

       . . . was the amazing  urlLink wise-asses.  It helps that there are a bunch of silly rules and funny clothes to wear and so much time sitting doing nothing that anything becomes really funny. Imagine sitting somethere for so long that you watch an entire 40 pound piece of ice melt in the Ft. Hood sun because they only deliver your ice rations every other day and your cooler only holds one days worth, not two. It helps that there is this surreal feeling of, "hmmm, this stuff is here to kill people pretty much just like me, the operator of this stuff."

        Option Period - Day 2 cont'd  We've put a bid on a house. We've exectued the contract. This essentially closes off the property from any other bids until we're done with them. Although we have essentially agreed on a 'price' this doesn't necessarily mean this is the price we will pay. Now begins (besides the option period) a time of specific information gathering about the house.  Next, i schedule a home inspection. The easiest thing to do is find someone who has bought a home recently and get a recommendation. You can search all day for inspectors on the internet and the yellow pages and still be just as lost as you were when you started. I called Doyle and got a recommendation from him. End of story.  I've also got to schedule a termite inspection. For this one, i'm going with the lady my realtor has recommended to me - mainly because i just don't have anyone else who could recommened a bug inspector to me (can you?). She lives and works in the area.  At the same time, the bank has to get started on it's work. I've sent them all pertinent financial documents, but they still need  original copies  of bank statements and other misc forms. (Remember that: original documents). I had a copy of the executed contract sent over to them so they can get the paperwork started on the loan.  I also called an insurance agent at my credit union do to a check on the property for any claims made on that property. Result: 0. I also had her give me an estimate for  Homeowners Insurance  and a Flood Policy. This is when i found out that, contrary to my assumption, i WAS NOT in a high risk flood area. As a matter of fact I am in an 'X' zone, denoting a minimal risk of flooding. The numbers came back: about 2000/yr for home ins and 248/yr for flood. She thought that was a little high, so i should shop around.  I contacted another insurance agent today and sent him on a quest for more affordable insurance for me. The quote should come back sometime tomorrow, hopefully.  I'll prolly schedule the inspection for sometime early next week; probably monday. Once all the inspections are done and the bank sends out the appraiser and surveyor, the real fun starts. Everyone returns to the negotiating table and tries to work out any problems that may have arisen from the various inspections - and potentially the price gets re-negotiated.   Possibilities Include:   Structural, mechanical or plumbing problems that need to be taken care of before the house will be bought.  or  The house is appraised for less than it's being sold for. (This is my biggest fear - a real potential deal killer)  So this is where I am at right now in case anyone was wondering.

        Option Period - Day 2  Adolfo IV fought waking up. He fought his diaper change; he fought getting dressed; he fought to get into the car seat...  It was shaping up to be a miserable day. Carol was running late for work.  I spent the majority of the day shopping for homeowners insurance. I also got ahold of Doyle, who pointed me in the direction of a good home inspector in the area; he's a little more expensive, but extremely thorough, respectable, and knowledgeable.  The further I get into homebuying the more i look back at what i've done so far - the more i second guess my every move. I'm trudging ahead, though, and trusting that i'm educating myself enough and have assembled a pretty good team of people to help me along the way: my agent and my lender.  It's hard to trust myself. That prolbably doesn't reveal a very healthy self-image, but it's the truth. My head is spinning with all the information.

        After I read about  urlLink Spoken Interface  I opened up the Speech control panel of my computer. Turning it on is like having a whole different computer. Instead of contorting my left hand into &lt;command&gt;&lt;tab&gt; to switch between apps, I just say "Switch to Safari." "iChat with Killy." "Connect to server." It is amazing what it is capable of. The next day, or maybe it was later that afternoon, O'Reillynet.com posted this article on speech with the Mac, which is a pretty good place to start if you are interested in exploring what it is capable of:  urlLink MacDevCenter.com: Are You Talking to Me? Speech on Mac OS X [Mar. 17, 2004]  Once you turn on the extended controls for assistive devices, the speech recognizer is able to control most things on the screen.   I wonder how long it will take for someone to write some glue in between a voice over internet application (like iChat) and speech commands.

        Option Period - Day 1  All the paper's have been signed and the option period begins. The next ten days is a window in which we can leave the contract without question, so now is the time for home inspectors, bug inspectors, appraisers and surveyors. I've been shopping around and have begun getting estimates on all the necessary insurances: flood, homeowners...etc...  This is when the real fun begins. Our home is still lightyears away, it seems.  Here are some interesting facts about the area:  - The nearest fire station is exatly .3 miles from home. - The Hispanic population of Oak Forest/Garden Oaks area is 15,440 - Two of my neighbors are lawyers. - One of my neighbors is co-owner of a pawn shop (I read her application for business license online) - The apprasied value of 4126 Donna Lynn has more than doubled since 1990. - My home has never flooded. - There is a park right around the corner.  Anyone know any good (or bad!) Home Inspectors? I'm really looking for someone who might know who NOT to use.

       I encourage you to cultivate your insanity, Paul!!  Did you know that Salvador Dali used to on occasion fall asleep with an egg in his hand so that he would remain on the verge of sleep for as long as possible, where the imagination is most lucid and ripe with creativity or insanity or both -- he would start to doze off and, then, just as the egg would start to roll from his hand he would jerk awake ... he continued to do this apparently over the course of an evening until he had gathered together some pretty far out material to inspire his art.  I, for one, would applaud a painting that depicted the love affair between a lettuce and a mer-lettuce ....

That always helped me win friends and influence others.  makes for a funny picture.  just think, when he's older and he calls you from jail again, ya'll can laugh about that one time you got him all dressed up for pictures by getting advice from friends.

       So I made a list, two lists really -- in one column I wrote down all the things that make me feel passionate ... in the other I wrote all the things that make me miserable.  Why?  To figure out what I should be doing with my life, of course.  Here it is:  PASSION New ideas, creativity, helping others, teaching, forging mental connections with other people, presenting an interesting idea to a group, designing gardens, reading, learning, solving problems, physical activity, interacting with new people, places, ideas, & situations, fighting for a just cause, philosophy, living with integrity, hard work, teamwork, nature, water, plants, animals, growth, planting, planning ...  MISERY Corporate America, rules without reason, micro managers, routines, lack of purpose, mundane tasks, menial labor, laziness, escapism, glib, glossy, & shallow interactions, greed, polite conversation, questions and answers that involve an utter lack of thought, blatant dishonesty, manipulation, wasting time ...  hmmmmm ... am I any closer to discovering what I should do with my life?  I don't know ... still doesn't seem very clear.  Am I missing something really obvious here?  Probably.

       I think Home Depot sells islands. Typically they are usually off the coast of georgia, south carolina, florida, or oregon. Buy a condo.

        Hey Killy, There is a stove fix-it place over by my place on Almeda. Island's, well you typically have to save up a few million megabux, but there are some in the world for sale. Ha, I'm joking, you can get them at Rent-A-Center, along with a giant screen TV, perfect for watching the game when you are supposed to be knocking down walls.  Small bathrooms in older houses? You are looking at the wrong older house. The house I grew up in (1920's) had a larger bathroom than the place I'm in now, which is so large that I've thought about moving into it. Then again, maybe I was just smaller in the memories of the house I grew up in, as my memory of the bathtub is that it was enormous.   Didn't you have something about a house that has been used, Killy?

        urlLink   I started eating yogurt because Colin said Laura said it makes you fart less. I'm still scared of any flavor other than peach, but I've gown to have enough of a taste for peach that I have started to care about my yogurt packaging. This comes to mind because I just opened up a package of Archer Farms (Target grocery house brand) and it is the kind where it has a little resealable lid with a plastic seal underneath. Why is this? Do people really eat half a thing of yogurt and then cap it off, "mmm, mm, I'm full!" on 6 ounces of material? I know my grandmother reuses yogurt and cottage cheese plastic containers to hold chex mix and the like, but neither seems to present much of a business case for the additional packaging. I think this is why I appreciate Yoplait's minimal packaging. There is just a little foil seal at the top and voila, you're in and you aren't wondering "Do I keep this lid around in case I don't finish all 6 ounces?

        The price of a house, variable; house hunting, priceless  Well, Amber the price of houses varies from place to place, from neighborhood to neighborhood, suburb to suburb. In the area that we are looking there are houses that range from 80,00 to however much we would like to pay, so there is a good spread. The houses we are looking at in Oak Forest are older houses, built in the fifties (i think the earliest i've seen was built in '48) which means that the bathrooms are generally smaller and located in the hallways rather than attached to any one bedroom. The idea of a 'master bath' simply doesn't exist unless the previous owners have updated it (and with updates come price increases).  For this reason alone, am i even remotely considering living a little further out so that i can get the larger bathroom that exists in more modern homes. I like big bathrooms, i hate small sinks. I hate having to wash my hands 'in sections, cause i can't fit my entire hand under the stream of water. I hate having to stretch un-naturally to reach the toilet paper while stiting down. I have lived in apartments too long.  Carol is adamant about living in the city. She hates the drive. I hate the drive myself but find my head spinning whenever she begins talking about the houses we've seen. Most conversations go like this:   Carol: "This kitchen is nice and big. There's plenty of room for us to put an island right here, and it's facing south so i can put an herb garden here (motions towards the windows)...   Killy (thoughts):  What are islands made of? Wood? I guess i would have to somehow stick it to the floor, huh? I would have to change out the tile in the kitchen too. What kind of tile --- oh, i like that ceramic tile. How many sq ft is this kitchen? I wonder how much ceramic tile is per sq ft? How long would it take me to change out the tile? oh yeah, the island, would that have to be built? or could you just  buy  an island? I guess she would want drawers in the island to hold stuff. Jeez, this sounds like a lot of work, i wonder how long it would take me. Would i have to design the island, or can you just buy a pattern like those patterns you can buy at craft stores for clothes? I wonder if Wes would know how to build an island in a kitchen. Adolph's dad has an island in his kitchen. Was that there when they first bought their house? Did they build it? ------ What?   Carol:  This oven is so cool! It doesn't work? Oh man, i would get this oven fixed. It's so beautiful.   Killy (thoughts):  Who fixes ovens? How much would that be? Lessee, one island plus, changing the tile in the kitchen plus one fixed oven (so far) ---- huh?    Carol:  This part could be a dining room....  and on and on and on it goes ... for every single part of the house. The bedrooms are too small,  so what's the answer? "...we can  just  knock out this wall!"   Killy (thoughts):  What does it take to knock out a wall? What if that part of the wall is holding up the ceiling? What about wiring? What about plumbing? Do any of my friends know how to do sheetrock? Ryan is in construction, but how often do i see him? Knocking down a wall seems pretty serious. Is it easy to do? I don't know how to knock down a wall.  and then the bathroom:   Carol:   We can extend the bathroom in to this closet.   Killy (increasingly frustrated thoughs):  Knock down another wall? Jeez, why don't we just knock down the whole fucking house and start over? That showerhead is way too low. Who lived here before we did? Were they oriental or what? pigmies? Why is the tile in the back corner crumbling? I guess that'll have to be taken care of too? I see a dead roach.  All of my thoughts are represented by a single grunt-like, "...eh..."

       We have found some houses in the 110k and 130k price range for 1500 square feet, three beds and one bath.  These are in a very good area, not prime retail spot, but still within the Loop (and a hop skip and a jump from the museum area).  If you move out into the subdivisions, you could find a 2000 square foot 4bed 2.5bath 2garage home for 130k.  But then you have at least an hour commute in Houston's famed traffic.  Houston's not too bad.

         Yesterday, Houston was awash in rain. The wind and the rain were so strong in the early part of the afternoon, that if you wanted to look out the 48th floor windows, you could actually see the building sway as you watched the traffic building up below. Also, if you were riding in the elevator during this time, the cars  would screech and groan as they bumped their way up and down. If you were so inclined to be in the bathroom during a particularly strong wind, you could see the water moving in the toilets to and fro. Hmmmmm. Pretty scary stuff.

       Killy, how much do 3 bdrms in Houston go for these days?  The cheapest digs avail up here start at $300K and that's for a crappy 2 bdrm condo with a shoebox front yard 2 hours outside of the city -- it's tough to find anything larger than a 1-bdrm anywhere in a 1-hour radius of the NYC metropolitan area -- Texas is looking better by the minute ...

        What a strange world we live in. I've been following the Haiti/Aristide thing through the lense of Pacifica Radio (KPFT) and last night caught some mainstream TV. In some ways, the situation in Haiti leads me to believe that NPR/BBC is remarkably limited in their world-view, neither's coverage seems very strong to me. The Charlie Rose show last night was excellent, mostly because Rose had someone who was actually from Haiti, partly because he had a broad range of viewpoints:  a Republican congressperson (representing the administration),  a former state department official (representing US government history),  a professor from Columbia University (representing US opposition), and  a radio journalist from Haiti (representing a knowledgable and intelligible Haitian).    One of the conversational gyres was the Columbia prof saying that the current administration was undermining Aristide by withdrawing aid as soon as it came in office. The congressman affirmed this and stated that the US stopped monetary aid because Aristide was embezzling it; however, other forms of aid to Haitians, like food aid, have never stopped. Rose asks the Haitian journalist if this was the case, and she basically confirms it.  The prof then went on about how the stopping of monetary aid was more than just that because it caused a financial payment crisis as the government couldn't pay debt without the cash aid. I missed the response to this, but the point seemed pedantic. Ultimately, if the point about Aristide's aid abuse was correct, then shutting it off would suck, but would be a more preferable method of affecting positive change than sending in the Marines guns-a-blazing.  The Pacifica coverage of the evening took a pretty hard-line stance that the US is supporting the opposition and basically abducted Aristide. One of the more interesting points of coverage is that Aristide's bodyguard was an American company, paid for by the US State Department. I'm thinking, what the hell? If the US is anti-Haiti and anti-Aristinde, why would they spend money on his bodyguards and why would he accept that kind of aid? It doesn't seem to make any sense.  In some ways I wonder if this is a sideshow for other things happening. Maybe it is a sideshow because it has been a pretty slow-news month. Maybe it is a less confusing alternative to attention paid to Venezuela, which is pretty confusing ( urlLink Caracas Chronicles ). Who are the bad guys? What is democracy? What is the purpose of government other than an alternative to anarchy?  Oh, and is there anything about the story of US Special Forces coming in to get Aristide at the Presidential residence that reminds anyone of Ghost Recon scenarios?

         urlLink   The train stand by my place is no longer new. the grooves in the anti-slip pavement are browned with dirt, the platform edge's fascia is stained in blooms of mold or perhaps where most people step on or off. The funk is collecting fast, litter is present in the cars now, although Houston evil-doers have not yet learned how to scritch-scratch their messages into the plexiglas. There seems to be a bit more up and down vibration at the car picks up speed; it makes me feel somewhat seasick; I wonder how true the rail-bed will stay in Houston's shifting soil. They can hardly keep the streets from buckling in the heat and random subsidence. The train's internal sign points the wrong way to the exit at McGowen; the announcer lady still makes Bell Street sound like Bill. Despite it being the first night of the rodeo, the train is largely empty northbound at nine. The trains are running doubled up in anticipation of the traffic.

       ???? The Passion Ends. You are left with two thoughts in your head. 1.  Wow that movie was violent..!!!!! 2.  What am I supposed to think about this movie. To expound on these thoughts.  1.  Wow that Movie was violent...!!!  Unbelievable.  First if this movie was accurate Jesus would have been dead long before they ever crucified him. Second you are relieved when they do.  Crucifixion seems like a holiday compared with the scourging.  2.  What am I supposed to think about this movie.  This follows the premise that you are supposed to actually think at all. Once the ultra-violence plays out you are pretty much left empty handed. There is nothing to mull over or think about. This isnt the Last Temptation.  or a M. Night Shamalany movie. He is resurrected and the movie is over. That said the flip side is this. The more you know the more you be able to percieve. This is the movie adaptation of a book. Actually it is the movie adaptation of the last chapter of a book. No the second to last chapter of a book. If you knew nothing of jesus this movie would make absolutley no sense. No context. Like flipping through channels on T.V. stopping on H.B.O. to watch the second to last episode of Sex in the City. Then canceling your cable subscription then moving to an Amish community. Two months later a tourist comes along and asks you. "What do you think about Carrie Bradshaw?"  Saw it at the Alamo Drafthouse. The chicken wings were awesome. The Pizza was okay. 20 minutes into the movie the guilt overcame me and I stopped eating.

        Why this picture is important     I was driving away from my mother's house and realized i had forgotten my ipod in the house. I had left it sitting on the cradle with the itrip attached while it played music to my stereo in the house. As i backed out of the driveway i realized that the radio was playing the music from my ipod. I drove away until i just barely started to lose reception; at that point i stopped and snapped a picture of my distance from the house. You may have to work a little bit to make out my mother's house through the wet window.

        The Search for a Home  Two weeks ago, it officially started. We walked into our credit union and applied for pre-approval on a home loan. The next day we heard back, we were 'approved'. This, of  course, means next to nothing. There is still a myriad of paperwork and higher ups at the bank that we have to cross before we are given any real money; this only provides us with a certain degree of legitimacy. The rate we were given was better (almost 2 points better!) than i was calculating, which only means we can afford that much more of a house than i was expecting.  My stomach is in knots most of the time. I am having weird 'house shopping' dreams that leave me with a sense of dread, regret, and buyers remorse. I have gone over our budget time after time. I have been watching every penny that leaves our account. I have been fretting over paying bills promptly and fully.  We have been 'out' three times, with three different agents. We settled on the last agent, Cookie, from Keller-Williams Realty. She is located there in the Garden Oaks/Oak Forest area and sells most of her homes in that area.  All in total we have seen 8 homes. Two were vetoed from the curb; i didn't even have to go inside. Two we vetoed as soon as the door was opened....  ****  This past friday I had a catharsis; carol and i both had to make the very real decision of where we really wanted to live. At the end of it, we chose the Oak Forest area. We had put sugarland into the mix out of frustration of not seeing what we wanted in a house right out of the gate. We wanted a bigger bedroom, larger bathrooms, bigger kitchens...in essence, space. The houses we had seen up front were WAY too small for us and it was very frustrating to hear "..that's the way the houses are in this area..."  Immediately i was imagining scooting around my bed the way I was doing on Marconi St.; I was imagining the smell of old sewer pipes in my back yard...all the shit i've experienced living in old montrose apartments. I was frozen by a fear that i would end up with something like that.  Carol talked me down, as she so often does. We are looking every weekend till we find 'the' place. I figure we'll be doing this for a few months, if not most of this year... we'll see. I'm trying not to think of it too much. I'm just going with the flow....     This is a photo of the backroom of an otherwise nice little house. What a fucked up addition! This was one of th houses that i had also put into my 'maybe' file, but after thinking about how much work would go into cleaning up that extra space in the back...i was more reluctant.

        Houston  Been busy as a bee at the house since Thursday after closing. Carol spent the end of last week cleaning most of the house. She resurrected the fridge and made the oven look like new. She sanitzed both bathrooms and cleared all the residual garbage left behind by the sellers.  Saturday was spent doing more cleaning, and prep work for painting. Adolph, Amber, Mike, Maru and Ezra came over to lend us a hand. We got so much done that day! The ceiling fans were cleaned, the dust bunnies were cleared out, the tops of the doors were wiped, tape was laid all across the floor boards and trim, the windows were wiped clear, the screens on the windows were cleaned, the cabinets in the kitchen were wiped down, the floor was swept, and the carpet was vacuumed!  Once everyone was gone, i started stripping the wallpaper from the kitchen walls. I did that till about 11:30. I started again at about 8 the next morning.   What a day! but that was only the beginning...  Sunday, Adolph stopped by and helped me to finish up putting primer on the living room walls. Then, my stepdad stopped by with some housewarming gifts and a whirlwind job on some electricity issues i've been having. Right off the truck he pulled out a mitre saw and table and a fifteen-year old jigsaw (i remember him using it when i was growing up). Then, he presented me with a Craftsman drill and flashlight along with a 101 drill bit set. What a score!  After his grand tour i started pointing out the problems i'd noticed with the electricity. He went to his truck and pulled out a new switch for the master bedrooma and replaced that in a matter of minutes. Then, he pulled out the pull chain mechanism in the third bedroom and instruced me on how to replace that.  That evening we retired to Sugarland to prepare for this upcoming week.  Monday: Solo. I dropped Carol at work and Adolfo iv at montessori, and went directly to the house. I finished putting primer in the living room and started sanding the kitchen walls to prep them for primer as well. Finished breakfast area and put a coat of primer on only a portion of the kitchen to see how many coats it was going to take to cover up the flaws in the wall....  I started priming the hallway and the bedroom. Put another coat of primer on in the kitchen after about an hour. Continued from the hallway to the bedroom.  Lunch at the Galleria with Carol.  Came back and put more primer in the kitchen. (About three coats....) and continued with the bedroom. Finished the bedroom and moved on to the half-bath...finished the bath....  Cleaned up and headed for adolfo iv. Picked up Carol and hit the freeway. Came home and had dinner.....  Here's a pan of the backyard.   urlLink

       I write from San Diego.   I came out to see my brother play at his  first solo show .  I and many others had been encouraging him for years to get out and play  his music , and finally last night he did.  And it was wonderful.  There was a good crowd, and despite some initial technical difficulties he and his back up band put on a good set.  I was so darn proud!  He calls his solo project  Manuok ; You can check more info  urlLink here .  I also saw a couple of other good bands this weekend, including  Goodbye Blue Monday  and  Waterline Drift .  The highlight was definitately Goodbye Blue Monday.  They build up so much energy that I thought the room would pop.    Also, I have eaten a shit load of mexican food out here (California style mexican food being different than Tex-Mex), and I think that I have concluded that  in general ,  California Mexican Food is better than Texas Mexican Food .  Except for the breakfast tacos.  So, all in all it has been a great weekend.  I think the key has been spending inordinate amounts of time on the beach.  Not bringing my computer along has helped a lot too.  Also, I am reading an Evelyn Waugh novel ('Vile Bodies') that is quite laugh-making.

       Hyatt Regency Atlanta built 1967. A little Hotel History for yous guys. The Pritzger (of Pritzger and Pritzger the largest lawfirm in North America) family bought the Hyatt House, a hotel next to the Los Angeles Airpot (LAX) in the 40's.  Thus began the "Hyatt" hotel brand.  In the sixties Hyatt Corp. started building  Atrium Hotels which the Hyatt Brand would become synonimous with.   Those atrium hotels would be branded the Hyatt Regency's . The Hyatt Regency Atlanta was the FIRST one to be built in 1967.  The fact that Mark and I shot this hotel, we have been told, means something pretty significant.  It is THE single most important hotel in the Company, again so we were told.  Who KNOWS? The whole hotel is pretty HO-hum.  So what could be the big deal? right?   Well the Director of sales put it like thus. D.O.S. "How long is the average home mortgage?" T "20 years?" D.O.S. "Maybe 30." T "oh?" D.O.S.  "So if this hotel was built in 1967 and if it was a house, that would mean?" T "That would mean Hyatt Corp owns a whole city block of Downtown Atlanta." D.O.S. "Exactly plus the Corp History of the whole thing."   urlLink    urlLink    urlLink

        Closing  Such a fitting term for the end of this.  I couldn't sleep last night. My stomach was turning thinking of every possible thing that could go wrong. I was petrified. I thought a lot about bug infestation. I thought, "what if this place is crawling with roaches?" Mind you, i looked for evidence of this during the inspection and found none. I thought a lot about rodents too, but of course, i never found evidence of this; no droppings in dark corners...etc.  I thought a lot about the money: the mortgage combined wtih our mound of debt neatly wrapped up with montessori school tuition. How much paint does it take to paint a house? I mean, how many actual gallons will i have to buy? Dropcloths? Brushes?...etc...ugh....  I worried myself to sleep. I woke up at 5:55 a.m.  I took a quick shower and chose just the right boxer shorts for our closing. We left the house right at seven o'clock and hit the HOV lane about 9 minutes later. We got Adolfo iv's school right before eight. We dropped him off with little more than a thrash as he was transferred from Carol's arms to Bernie's (his morning teacher).  We picked up some breakfast and headed to First Educators Credit Union to pick up our cashier's check that we would eventually present to the Title Company to settle our closing costs.  We arrived at closing right on time (9:30 a.m. sharp) and went straight back to a conference room and were instructed to sit on the right side.  "Buyers to the right and sellers to the left, please, so i can keep it straight," said our title officer, Gary Stokes.  We were in a first floor corner office in Greenway Plaza, with windows all around facing Richmond. There was a long, shiny table that was set diagnolly in the room topped with cookies (!?), a large bowl of miscellaneous candy (the big mixed bag kind you buy for Halloween), and pens at every chair.  The British accented secretary asked us if we cared for drinks. We both asked for water.  The chairs were so comfortable i hardly noticed them behind me. Once we sat down and water was set down we got straight to business. Signing, initialing, signing and dating, sign but don't date this page, can you initial at the bottom of this page...  "Could you please sign with the 'third'?"   "Well, i don't normally sign that way..."  "Well, it's printed with a third on it, and it has to look exactly as it's printed."  "um, allright, sure... (if it has to look exactly as it printed, then why are you asking for a signature? - can't i just look at the print and give you a 'thumbs-up?')"  Everything in my experience was wholly unlike all the horror stories carol and i heard from co-workers. We weren't in there for four hours. Our hands didn't cramp up. The money didn't mysteriously NOT come through. The loan officer wasn't some slacker who waited till the last minute to process my loan. The real estate agent didn't over look this or that fax. The title officer didn't have a car accident on the way into work.  If i filtered all the waiting for copies to be made and for the wire transfer to happen, for all the explanations and the few questions we had, i would say that we probably signed, initialed and dated for a grand total of 20 minutes.  We walked (floated) out of there in 1 hour and 15 mins. We went directly to the house. Stanley Dessen, the previous owner, had just locked up the house and was leaving for his new home about 15 miles further north on 290.  Once they turned the corner I carried Carol across the threshold for the second time. This is what we saw (minus the broom, mop, vacuum, and chair):     There is a lot of work to be done, but we've got plenty of time to do it. Carol and I are happier than we've been in a long time.

       From "Gardens of Persia," a book by Penelope Hobhouse listed on amazon.com:  Buildings, water, and plants combine to give the gardens of Persia a beautiful spiritual quality that has served to inspire garden design across time and diverse cultures. Indeed, Ms. Hobhouse begins with the oldest living garden, Pasargadae, created by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC. It represented paradise on earth and spawned other gardens to be seen as settings for sacred contemplation and spiritual nourishment. In later centuries, these gardens evolved further around the world as representations for romance, power, prestige, and symbols of the afterlife.

       Carol, don't worry -- Killy's metabolism will catch up with him in a few years!! ;>  Anthony's getting the cutest little pot belly, but he was thin as a rail until he turned 40 and started eating my home cookin' ...  Paul, I love your description of that garden -- do you remember where you read that article?  Some of the best garden magazines, like Horticulture and Fine Gardening, have pages of garden travel itineraries listed in the back with gorgeous photographs taken from all over the world (gardens of the Mediterranean, gardens of the Himalayas, gardens of Ireland, etc.) ... definitely my idea of a great vacation as well ... I actually would have liked to have gone to Costa Rica on our honeymoon to see the Cloud Forest, but Jamaica was cheaper and closer ...

       Hey everyone -- check out my new website:  www.plantladyland.com I'm enjoying the landscape design history class I'm taking right now -- it's all about how different cultures have interpreted their gardens ... it's amazing the extraordinary lengths middle eastern cultures would go to to create garden oases in the desert and how the garden of eden and the idea of paradise as a garden developed out of this barren landscape ...  And then there's the perplexing and intriguing world of asian landscape design -- where gardens were created to entice and confuse the senses -- nothing is out in the open .. all the paths are winding and multi-tiered through grottos, by ponds, and up hills and into moon viewing pagodas -- where false endings seemed to signify a closure but really, should you look more closely, actually might lead to a whole new pathway.  It's refreshing to see the way gardens have not always been simple cookie-cutter, sanitized versions of the American grass lawn and meatball hedges ... where differences were celebrated more and character was often prized over attempts at aesthetic perfection.

        Name Changes  Inspired by Belin... *ahem* .. Claire's name change, i've instituted the following name changes for the group. These are effective immediately.  Colin will now be known as  Morton   Paul will now be known as  Vicente (pronounced, vee-sen-teh)   Todd will now be known as  Sam   Adolph will now be known as  Zippy   Amber will now be known as  Peaches (blong wig optional)   Diana will now be known as  Fontana   Taggart will now be known as  John   Liz will now be known as  Slugger   Killy will now be known as  Dirk   Carol will now be known as  Ambrosia   I know it will be hard to remember at first, but i think we'll all get used to our new names pretty quickly.  Enjoy

       Well, not quite.  Tax season for the Tax Department at Hines is open all year as we work with extensions and annual reports as well as quarterly estimation payments and all sorts of stuff.  Good thing is, I will always stay busy.  Of course, never as busy as April 15th, which by the way, I learned was an extension for individuals as originally, tax deadline was the Ides of March.  Although I never learned why it was originally March 15...  In any case, first off, CONGRATULATIONS COLIN! Welcome to the corporate world... Is that what it is for you creative types??  I don't know, all I know is what is the best stapler to order for your cubicle (Swingline, mid price), which plants grow best under the various office lamp types, how to password protect your pc word docs and what neato office supplies you can make off with, in the darkest minutes of the most treacherous days...   Amber, Thank you for your kind words, but we all know how difficult it is to be the object of affection for Killy as he is always calling me fat and big-butt.  So, as far as being thin goes, convince my husband. ;-)  Anyway, trudging away for my regular pay has kept me off the blog for a while, but I hope to be able to update more often when I (keeping my fingers crossed) have a little house.  Later all!

         Congrats Colin! You know, benefits are over-rated, for the passably healthy at least. I still haven't made it around to making it to the dentist yet.     Hi Amber, the guy next to Jett is Liosuke (my spelling is probably wildly off), Madeline's boyfriend. He just got accepted to film school at the Univerisity of Ohio and he and Madeline will be moving to Athens at some point soon.     Also, not pictured is baby Adolfo and Chloe, Amber McCarthy's dog, and Asher, Ann's dog.

         Cough Cough...wheeze.....alot of dust on this thing on my end. Haven't used this tool for communication in a while. Not sure if it still works, well, we'll see.   Folks, after a grand life change, which so many of you were there to witness, my moving way out here and starting my family, I have scratched and scrounged for five years to make the ends meet for my crew. I have worked here and there, sometimes awash with enough and at others at the humbling back of the line at the unemployment dept. This whole time I have managed to never land a full time job with those mythical benefits and regular paycheck. I have gone, as stated before, from one industry to another trying to find a home that would take some of the pressure of providing off the forefront of my mind.   I have become quite proficcient at being a freelance designer/illustrator, But as of today, I will no longer, for a time, have to seek out the source of my income. I finally got a full time job. I will start on the 3rd of next month. Yes it is at Nike, the bohemoth of sport ego corporate culture.   For a time my family and I shall go to the doctor and dentist just for the hell of it. After not seeing the dentist since I left college I am afraid what he will say, something akin to, "Were you wanting to keep all thoses black rotting stumps, or should we discuss some plan of action."  Blagh, blagh blah....................Basically I wanted to share with ya'll the excitement that the girls and are are feeling at this new turn of events.  miss all of you  piss piss poop pee shit bang fuck.  love colin.

        The Last Couple of Weeks  carol, adolfo iv, and i have been to austin twice in two weekends. The first was to see Paul for his 30th birthday. Onion Rings and chocolate shakes at Hut's. Mmmmmm. We were also supposed to get some family pictures taken, but the timing was all wrong.  The next weekend, we went up for Meagan's Baby Shower. Luckily, she gave us her hotel room at the Holiday Inn Express saturday evening. Todd had dinner with us when we showed up at the Bennigan's next door. Then, we gave adolfo iv the some running around time before we piled in the car and headed to Barne's & Noble in the arboretum ... you only appreciate the accoustics in a place like that when you child throws two screaming fits.  Todd kept setting off alarms in all the stores we would go into, because he kept an  urlLink inventory control device  in his wallet. (I assume he just thought they looked really cool) We got stopped by the girl in B&N and was forced to prove we didn't have any unpaid books.  Once we dropped mom and boy off at the hotel we grabbed our things and headed to Mojo's for some (more) coffee and some 'peace'. It was nice to sit and chat with todd again....   Early Sunday Morning  - We dash off to breakfast with Meagan and family at a 1st street mexican restaurant. Delicious huevos rancheros and coffee, and with meagan. it was great. carlene was so happy and adolfo iv behaved so well.  Taggart showed up and i split with him to assist him on a shoot. We showed up at what  urlLink used to be the showpalace . Taggart got a hand me down job from Mark: shooting strip club furniture! We spent an hour and a half setting up lights and moving stuff around.  I met up with Paul and Todd at Flips and got a great Illustrator lesson from todd. We worked on the 'Cakery Bakery' logo for Rocio & Mikes start-up bakery in Lockport. I think we're making pretty good progress.     Once i got back, i was immersed yet again in our potential home. The insurance company underwriters came back with their decision: i am insurable! so i had to get them in touch with my lender so they could fax the proper documents over. One step closer.   The next things are:  Get the utilities hooked up, or switched over to my name, rather; and choose a home warranty company i want to use. (The sellers are purchasing a home warranty plan for us for the first year.  I spent 1 hour last night trolling Home Depot for the items i'll be needing for the first week of home ownership: paint, dropcloths, brushes, cleaners, rake, shovel, wet/dry vacuum....

        Aphasia This is a poem that I found in the April 2004 edition of the  urlLink New Yorker .  I think it is really lovely.  I am overjoyed to have found it; It is  precisely  the kind of poem that I love to read, and long to write.  Enjoy.    APHASIA   His signs flick off. His names of birds and his beautiful words-  eleemosynary, fir, cinerarium, reckless - skip like pearls from a snapped necklace scattering over linoleum.  His thinking won't venture out of his mouth. His grammar heads south. Pathetic his subjunctives; just as pathetic his mangling the emphatic enclitic he once was the master of.  Still, all in all, he has his inner weather of pure meaning, though the wind is keening through his Alps and his clouds hang low and the forecast is "Rain mixed with snow, heavy at times."  -  urlLink Vijay Seshadri     Aphasia  - total or partial loss of the ability to use or understand language; usually caused by stroke, brain disease, or injury.   Enclitic  - An enclitic is a clitic that is phonologically joined at the end of a preceding word to form a single unit.

        I noticed today that the cameras mounted above the traffic lights have a little antenna behind them. I noticed this while at Deitrick's on Westheimer, looking out at the westbound Westheimer traffic light at Hazard. It's fascinating. I wonder what you could do with that? I assume the units are cameras because they are mounted in a cylindrical housing with an integrated sunshade on a pipe well above the traffic signals but aimed down at the lanes of traffic faced by the below signals. Given the antenna, I would assume that the data is wireless and the cable going into it is power.  Now what are they for? At first, I was dismayed to see them going in as I have read about traffic cameras being used for correspondence traffic ticketing. However, I haven't heard a peep about that in Houston despite a mojor deployment going on. Where is the traffic camera money coming from and for what are they being used? If they are being used to study traffic, then why aren't the lights better timed?   urlLink Houston TranStar - The Greater Houston Transportation and Emergency Management Center

        I had this idea at lunch today and think it might apply to grade-school or older art-education: Software that converts a picture into a coloring book line-art drawing. Does something like this exist already? It would work like rotoscoping, except that instead of color areas, the software would make an outline. The concept would be to allow students to explore the color regions of objects (like a still life) in front of them without being excessively concerned about their ability to accurately depict shape.     urlLink Don Markstein's Toonopedia Glossary: Rotoscope

        I remember once upon a time in VMSNotes asserting that the stock market was a ponzi scheme and the various replies that people had. I don't feel any different now, other than realizing that it is a moderately regulated Ponzi scheme that agregates capital in various utilitarian arrangements. It was interesting to read this on  urlLink The Mark Cuban Weblog - www.blogmaverick.com :  Mr Gabelli disagreed. He responded with the omnipresent retort to all things stocks, Warren Buffet buys stocks.  Yes. Mr. Gabelli, you are right. At that time he did. But he doesnt buy 100 or 1k shares at a time as you have  suggested the typical investor should consider doing, or should trust you to do for him or her. Mr Buffet buys enough  shares to have influence and in many cases control. Can the average investor do that? Can the typical fund do  that?

          Amber asked me what was wrong with her computer today and inclosed a screenshot, of which the above was part.  Top Ten Reasons Why:   10. Stop parking your hot coffee or tea cup on top of your computer! You can put a glass of ice-water there though.  9. A sack of ice from the grocery store is a good 99 cent solution.  8. I think that your computer cannot handle your skill at minesweeper. Stick to smaller maps!  7. It is obviously that background. Only the Microsoft XP (tm) Rolling Hills with Clouds (tm) should be used.  6. Time for a new computer. That one is screaming "I want to be Margie's computer!"  5. First step in troubleshooting: Is your computer plugged in?  4. Second step in troubleshooting: Please erase your hard drive and reload your operating system.  3. This is just your computer saying, "Captain, I'm giving her all she's got!"   2. That isn't a toaster oven tray that pops out the front of your computer...  1. It's a "non-critical threshold." This is just your computer telling you to not worry and be happy! It'll let you know when it is critical.

The problem had something to do with Blogger's recent revampification.  I have also learned that they are probably  urlLink moving to SOAP , so I wonder when it is that I will have to   clean up   Paperlantern so that it works with this new interface....    Paper Lantern is 100% pure Cocoa, written in Objective-C.  It sports a  urlLink SQLite  database (Objective-C wrapper provided by  urlLink blackholemedia.com ) and uses Apple's  urlLink WebServicesCore framework  to handle the XML-RPC calls.

        Action Script 2.0! Looks like ActionScript has gotten a major  urlLink overhaul .  Chief among the changes are a bunch of  Object-Oriented  features such as formal class syntax, inheritance and interfaces; as well as  Strong Typing .  With PHP going through a similar metamorphosis, one might ask if any scripting language is safe from OO creep...

        I guess I'm not really looking for a BBEdit replacement, but  urlLink SubEthaEdit  would certainly be a candidate (if I didn't use grep so much).  [ Update: ] Looks like I spoke too soon. On their  urlLink features page , they list grep as a new feature!  [ Update: ] You use spaces for tabs but when you hit delete, you delete out the "tab" instead of space by space!

        Staining the Night away     Friday night, among other things, i stained my son's new dinner table. He seems to have graduated from the high chair, even though he still eats from it. But he's got the coordination to sit in his own little chair. The last few times we've told him it's time to eat, he's run to the living room and pulled up his little blue yard chair rather than clamour for me to unlock his high chair for him.  Both carol and i decided it was time for an upgrade. We went to IKEA looking for a suitable little table and found one;  urlLink nude with two chairs (for when he has dinner guests) . I went to Home Depot and got some deep cherry stain and some polyeurethane (sp????) to varnish it with.     Try to imagine this with a nice deep shiny wood color. It'll end up looking nicer than his parents dinner table!  Aside from this little project, i managed to paint a couple of walls in the living room, get my car from my mother's house (which, incidentally, drove just fine; although, i'm still very interested in fixing before i get it back on the road with any regularity), get a haircut for both my son and i, got my shopping done, did another pass for fleas over the carpet with the vacuum, gave a decent sweeping to the garage, put some curtains in the living room, and most importantly, RESTED.

          I stopped using Expose because pushing F9 is always a hunt and peck. This afternoon I noticed the "hold shift down" and tried it out with right mouse click: Pretty Nice!  [ Update: ] This doesn't work by control-clicking. Holding down control and clicking the mouse button (in single clicker mice like the Powerbook's built in trackpad and clicker) doesn't equate to a right click, so the above trick doesn't work on a Powerbook by &lt;Shift&gt; &lt;ctrl&gt; clicking.

       For work related reasons i am unable to see the templates (blogger is blocked???) so I am inclined to go with todd's template advice.  but really, i don't care what you guys choose. It actually reminds me of a church marquee sign i pass on my morning bus commute to work:   Jog on in. God don't care what you wear.   The church gets a lot of jogger traffic since it's right off of heights blvd with a long jogging track down its center island. And speaking of communting, I walked out of my house at 6:06 this morning, missed the bus and waited half an hour for the next one. Didn't get into work until exactly 8 a.m. I have sworn off busses. I have no idea how i'm going to get to work tomorrow.  I took a vacation from vacuuming for fleas last night and fiddled around with a wireless router i got from work. After a frustrating 15 mins i decided this was too much for killy and called adolph over with a promise of dinner and ice cream. He showed up much quicker than i had expected.  After we ate, he tinkered with the router for an hour or so before declaring it dead. Too bad too; although, if i'm at home sitting on the desk why wouldn't i just tether myself to the modem via ethernet? Of course, what about the imac, which will not be in the 'office', but in our room or the living room? I guess i could just hook the cable up to the imac and use it as the base station... (hmmm....didn't john p. say he had an old spare base station?)  Tonight: 1. Pick up car from mom's place as a potential way to work? 2. Put away all the paint in the garage. 3. Unbox and prepare adolfo's new mini-dinner table 4. Fix ceiling fan in the living room

       My  urlLink motorphobia  has only worsened, and I detest what high automobile ownership rates  have done to  urlLink  development patterns  in our cities, so  I greatly feared that setting up shop here in the  West  would mean the end of my wonderful ' no-car ' lifestyle.

To that end I have shopped around a bit, but to be honest I am quite overwhelmed by the variety of models, components, configurations, brands and bike-bells.    Since my short term need is merely a get-around-Austin bike, but my long term goal is to ride in something like the  urlLink MS150  and to be able to make month-long bike tours of Scandinavian countries,  does anyone with bike-riding or bike-purchasing experience have any sort of recommendations as to models and brands, etc?

        Metro Rail Rain, vacuum patterns, and my in-laws I could hardly belive that it was raining as hard as it was when i left work today. Luckily i left a little earlier than usual so i could make it over to the metro office in the medical center and purchase a cash value card. By the way, buy this card once and it seemingly allows you unlimited rides on the rail without ever having to justify its monetary value. I had always wondered about this, especially after i saw several people flash them to the metro cops checking tickets recently.  "So, i can use this to ride the rail?"  "yes."  "do i have to insert it in the machine for a ticket?"  "no"  "so all i have to do is flash it to the metro cop if they happen to check it?"  "yep"  so conceivably you could carry around an empty cash value card and ride the lite rail all day with nothing to worry about, unless of course, they start carrying around little card swipers.  I made it to the train just before it and a torrent of rain swept over the entire medical center. It was crazy. It was like driving through a laser wash. A stiff wind came along with it and blowing sheets of rain along the left side (*ding!* - a la izquierda) of the train. Oh, and if you've even wondered about those little green circle lights on the door as you exit, they REALLY DO OPEN THE DOORS.    "If you need to get off, please press the green button to open the doors. I'm not going to open all the doors so all of you get wet."   The 'exiters' (4 people total) didn't really get the point. They all got up and each one pressed the button on one of the four doors. All four doors opened and in came the rain, like a swarm of bees.  The next group all dutifully assembled around one door and left. The door quickly shut behind them. The rain was coming down too hard to get out at my stop, so i figured i would take the train to the end of the line and hit it on the way back, giving the rain some time to pass over downtown.  I always imagined that at the end of the line, the train made a large circle and came back around. I was disappointed - very disappointed - that the driver merely stopped and moved from what was now the back of the train to the front. What a let down.  but my gamble paid off; the rain was just a sprinkle when i got off at main street square.  I got home to a home full of dead fleas! yes! Of course, i know that this really isn't the case, and that  urlLink there is still plenty to do in my fight against this enemy.   I vacuumed the entire carpeted portion of my house - every corner and crack and crevice to pick up as many of the dead little carcasses, pupae and larva as i could. This will go on until i can get the back yard treated, which won't be until the rain ends: sometime next week.  My favorite thing about vacuuming is the vacuum pattern. I wish i had taken a photo. Tomorrow look for this.  The in-laws are leaving for chicago tomorrow, so they were dropped off by mike and maru so carol can take them to the airport tomorrow afternoon. I was just finishing up the vacuuming as they arrived. Dropping off turned into a full evening visit with dinner, margaritas, and a ritual blessing of our home by carol's parents. (FLASHBACK: they also married us kneeling at their bedside when we told them we were living together.)  Once the blessing was done, which involved a series of prayers in spanish recited in each and every room of the house (including the garage, but excluding the shed outside); carol's father blessing the house with the baby's left over holy water from his baptism with a lettuce leaf; and the burning of our wedding candle; i was able to finish up something i had been meaning to do since this weekend. I put up curtains in our bedroom.  With this, the night concluded (for me, at least) and i retired to my office, lay on the floor absent of fleas and wrote out a monster post.

       I want God, I want poetry, I want danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin. -Aldous Huxley  This is the opening quote in the new book I'm reading, "Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates," by Tom Robbins -- I love Tom Robbins -- his words are so luscious and rich, like chocolate cake he makes me squirm and salivate with anticipation as I seek the mental fulfillment and inspiration that only a handful of writers inspire ... for me, it's Tom Robbins, Salman Rushdie, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez ... all the others are as dull as dirt in comparison.  More from Tom's new book:  Butterflies were delicate and gossamer, but this moth possessed strength and weight.  Its heavy wings were powdered like the face of an old actress.  Butterflies were presumed to be carefree, moths were slaves to a fiery obsession.  Butterflies seemed innocuous, moths somehow ... erotic.  The dust of a moth was a sexual dust.  I love it, I love it, I love it!!  So, anyway ... everyone, pick up a copy of the new Esquire if you can -- Anthony's got 7 illustrations in their special travel destinations section -- should be very cool ...  And, a photographer from the New York Post was at our apartment yesterday photographing the garden -- they're doing an article on New York container gardens so they interviewed me and took a couple hundred photos ... they said to look for it in either this Saturday's real estate section or the following Saturday, but you know how unpredictable these things can be ...

       On my way to Figure Drawing class last night I began wondering just when I would see an artist bust out a  urlLink PowerBook  and a  urlLink Wacom Drawing Pad .  Well that very night about halfway through the session this designer guy does exactly that - he busts out his laptop and drawing pad, fires up some kind of photoshop/paint  program and pulls off some kick-ass renderings from the 10-15 minute poses.  What the technology enables is amazing-  you lay down some finely tuned sem-tranparent layers with out having to mix up anything special.  And you can do all of this without having to wait  for anything to dry!   It was pretty amazing.  Speaking of amazing, the model last night had this figure and pose that were straight out of an  urlLink Ingres  painting.

        John is Graduating & Killy has fleas I got an email invite to his commencement last night. For those of you in the san marcos area, he'll be walking at 7p.m. this friday, may 14th. He got a degree in speech communications. (What kind of job does that land you?)  I spent last night vacuuming for fleas and getting things moved from off the carpet. I scheduled a spraying today, hopefully this will clear up this unfortunate infestation. For those of you who might be now or in the future infested with fleas, vacuuming seems to be the best remedy for clearing up larve and eggs that are left behind. One female can lay between 400-500 eggs. They are normally laid on a host, but because they don't 'stick' they just fall off into the carpet and/or bedding areas. Vacuuming is the best bed, according to online reading. Next best thing is steam cleaning the carpet. This, apparently, will kill larve and eggs, but i'm kinda doubtful cause i 'steamed' the carpets about two weeks ago. (I must get that machine back to annabel.) There are plenty of other more extensive ways to treat, such as slamming boric acid into your carpet -- time consuming and toxic -- but i don't want that stuff around the boy.  for some reason Adolfo iv decided to wake up at 4:45 this morning. Carol, of course, throws a fit even though she went to bed as early as he did: around 9. I eventually made it to the bed around midnight. Even though i was up as early as i've ever been, had breakfast and a cup of coffee, I still managed to miss the bus. The next one arrives in about 5 to ten minutes and takes the HOV lane to get downtown.   Work is as slow as can be right now. I've got a couple of posters in the queue and my weekly conferences, but both of these have become as intuitive as peeing in your sleep.  At one point last night, adolph and i set up our camera's for some video chatting. How fun, adolfo really got a kick out of seeing adolph full screen on the computer. He was all giggles.

        One of the things that I have long thought is counter-intuitive is the Iraqi occupation using former regime structures, like the palaces for the administrators and Abu Ghraib for a prison. It smacks of bone-headed parsimony: "well, we got these great buildings that are secure and we may as well use them..." It is a clich? to say that the occupation leadership is lack-luster, but the use of former regime structures is abysmal choice. It seems to come more from lack of vision of alternatives rather than malice, but it is not inspiring to hear that those same palaces will become the US embassy when the occupation is over.  The AM radio personality Limbaugh is pretty off about the nature of crimes in Abu Graib. It is more akin to that movie with the banjos than the popular conception of collegiate hazing. For one, the perpetrators are country folk from West Virginia (i.e. not typical fraternity undergraduates); and two they came from an army reserve military police unit with members whose regular jobs were at prisons. From  urlLink this week's New Yorker article : Bobeck explained: What I got is that SSG Frederick and CPL Graner were road M.P.s and were put in charge because they were civilian prison guards and had knowledge of how things were supposed to be run.  Bobeck also testified that witnesses had said that Frederick, on one occasion, ?had punched a detainee in the chest so hard that the detainee almost went into cardiac arrest.?   The most awful truth of this thing will likely be that in Iraq we are seeing exposed to the world what incarcerated Americans face every day. Broom-handle in the butt?  urlLink Abner Louima would say that it is nothing new in the USA.   On the other hand, the other clich? of a vast right-wing conspiracy is in high dudgeon. The hyped outrage should come as no surprise, but what amazes me is that the reports are  urlLink nothing new , but for some reason the Abu Ghraib pictures changed things. I thought the KPFT commentators didn't pay attention to corporate media like 60 Minutes? Let's give a big Al-Hurrah for the corporate media acting as stenographers for the military's investigation of itself!

        Home of the Cardboard Box and General Disarray  I think the pink eye is less of an issue than the incredible disarray of our home right now. He is, afterall, only contagious the first twenty-four hours, which ended about 1/2 an hour ago.  I'm glad this day is coming to an end.

        Hey  urlLink Paul , Election day as a holiday would be difficult to pull off in the US. For one, any year can have any number of elections. For another, it would be difficult to geographically arbitrate holidays for things like municipal elections. For example, Houston has a vote coming up concerning city worker pensions. As a simplification, one could stipulate that the election day holiday would only be for the November elections. However, as a practical matter, this would work against democracy: since the election with the holiday would appear to take precedence (no pun intended), all other elections throughout the year would lose mind-share, meaning they would become more controlled by small but dedicated portions of the population.

        I love monitoring this stuff: urlLink DHL - Tracking Summary    Package tracking would make a great reality TV show. There would be a lot of tension as the cameras follow 7 obsessive package trackers. Some would obsessively call the company they made an order with and repeatedly ask for a tracking number, even when the package has not shipped yet. Some would not have their work address on file with their credit card company, delaying shipment. Some would forget to ship it to the office and get the dreaded missed you slip on their front door, necessitating a duck-time race to the UPS office in some industrial part of town. No show would be complete without people who ordered expensive new models of Apple computers which in some cases are shipped overnight from Taiwan. When the first 802.11g computers came out, they were held up in Customs in Anchorage, Alaska--a real nail biter!  Of course, in the age of near-ubiquitous and inexpensive overnight shipping, package tracking is nearly moot, as the package is in your hands almost faster than you can get the tracking number.  Package Tracking Reality TV: you heard about it here first!

         "'This is an opportunity for the president to speak directly to the people in Arab nations and let them know that the images that we all have seen are shameless and unacceptable,' McClellan said."  On the radio this morning, even the BBC was repeating the phrase "shameless and unacceptable." I wonder if this is going to be repeated enough to become a common phrase like, "now more than ever." I think maybe this is something straight from the presidential mouth because it has an oddly torqued linguistic logic: how can images be "shameless and unacceptable?" The pictures themselves simply exist; they depict actions that are unacceptable; but if the images are shameless and unacceptable, then you are denouncing the pictures, not the actions.

        Pink Eye  An unexpected call from the montessori school today: adolfo has pink eye. The last time we heard this, it wasn't pink eye at all, but a respitory infection that had mucus draining from his eyes as well as his nose.  Luckily, we still have the pink eye drops we rushed out and got, but hopefully this is just another 'mis-diagnosis' from the school. It would be nice to NOT have to take another day off of work.

        05.03.04  Knowing that i would snooze the alarm over and over again till i was late, i left it on the floor next to bathroom door rather than placing it on my bedside table. It rang dutifully at 5 a.m.  I showered, shaved and ironed my pants for the day. I packed up my computer and was out the door at exactly 6:06 a.m. to catch the Metro 50 off 43rd and Costa Rica. The neighborhood was of course, quiet. There was no breeze, but it was unseasonably cool; the sky was dark blue. I could hear an occasional bird off in the distance, but it was otherwise silent. I As i turned the corner onto Georgi, i could see the first couple of students being dropped off at Scarborough High School. A round hispanic girl kissed her mother goodbye and stepped out of a late model chevy cavalier enveloped by this mornings darkness. The car pulled away from the edge of the black iron gates that surround the school with a sharp u-turn, swinging it's headlights across the street in front of me.  One minute, and 40 seconds.  I made my way down Costa Rica in a little over four minutes and sat on the cement bench and waiting for the bus. This was, in essence, a crap shoot. A couple of weeks before i had bought the house, i had looked on metro's website for the 50 route. Apparently, there are three different 50's: one hits the HOV lane, one takes all the little backroads and one is a special school route (or some variation of the two previous routes.)  The time 6:15 a.m. was stuck in my head. So i waited only 2 minutes for the bus. It arrived at 6:13. I was downtown at exactly 7:00 -- just as the train was pulling away from the station.  I sat at the station and waited for the next train to arrive. downtown was quiet and wet. There were yellow vested city workers spraying down the bird shit off the sidewalks and the train stops.  The train pulled into the station with a surprisingly large load of passengers at approximately 7:12 (right on time).  I arrived at the medical center at 7:26 and walked into MDACC at 7:30.

        I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last night, like a lot of folks. I watched it at the River Oaks cinema; Wes said that he saw it last night at the Edward's Cinema; yesterday Dad said they were going to see it in Shreveport because the good liberal folk of Shreveport banded together and petitioned the distributor in Dallas to screen a copy in that oft-forgotten market.  I didn't go expecting much, as I was dismayed by Bowling for Columbine. However, a day later I am still thinking of Fahrenheit 9/11 and am still favorably impressed. It still is a Michael Moore film; it still is infused with gotcha rather than thoughtfulness. However, it seems a remarkably more mature work. While it does not fully address the topics it looks toward, it serves as a new lens in which to view recent history.

Just a makeover, really.  Please check out the website for a peek at their current situation. Please submit all design & site map ideas before the end of work on Friday, June 25th by posting them to the blog, or they can be brought with you to the Housewarming Party that same weekend (Sunday, June 27th, 2004).

        One of the hot topics now a days is government power to track people and detain them and suspend the normal rules and so forth. The thing is that the rules aren't there to protect people from government, they are also there to keep government running smoothly. In the latest twist of the prisoner abuse story, top Washington administrators keep prisoners "off the books," and apparently then forget that the prisoners exist!     urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Prison Abuse: Rumsfeld Issued an Order to Hide Detainee in Iraq :  "WASHINGTON, June 16 - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, acting at the request of George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, ordered military officials in Iraq last November to hold a man suspected of being a senior Iraqi terrorist at a high-level detention center there but not list him on the prison's rolls, senior Pentagon and intelligence officials said Wednesday. . . . Seven months later, however, the detainee - a reputed senior officer of Ansar al-Islam, a group the United States has linked to Al Qaeda and blames for some attacks in Iraq - is still languishing at the prison but has only been questioned once while in detention, in what government officials acknowledged was an extraordinary lapse. 'Once he was placed in military custody, people lost track of him,' a senior intelligence official conceded Wednesday night. 'The normal review processes that would keep track of him didn't.'"   The Times' informant speculates that this has something to do with not letting the Red Cross see the prisoner, but this doesn't make sense if they aren't "interviewing" him, eh?

       "Genuine Imitation Leather"  Nope, folks, it just doesn't get much better than that.  Who came up with that phrase?  Some super oily, brazen salesperson, I'd reckon.  Damn, I love hazelnut-flavored nondairy creamer!  Not to mention just about every baked good must have trace amounts of aluminum in it from that description..  Now that you mention it though, there is one area where I still have weird memory lapses -- computer messaging.  I regularly get a feeling of deja vu when sending an e-mail or posting a blog -- wait, haven't I already said that before?  Did I send an e-mail just like this already?  Maybe it's the lack of context -- no scenery to associate with a past dialogue, no verbal response, just these sort of ephemeral words out in space ... or, maybe, I'm just an aluminum-head, after all ...

Despite lots of research, we still don't know. . . Even more insidious, aluminum is added to many municipal water supplies to help remove floating debris. Aluminum is also found in household baking powder, self-rising flour, cake mix, pancake batter, and frozen dough (as sodium aluminum phosphate, a leavening agent); in nondairy creamers, table salt, and other powdered foods (as an anticaking ingredient); in processed cheese (as an emulsifier); and in hemorrhoid preparations (up to 50 percent aluminum hydroxide).

       Adolph,  Did you know that studies have shown that aluminum-based deodorants are linked with early onset of alzheimer's?  Not that you have alzheimers, but hear me out ... just about every commercially available brand of deodorant has aluminum in it -- now we all know not to eat food that's been cooked in aluminum pots for this very reason -- but what about deodorant?    Since becoming prego, I've also discovered that I get a skin rash from using aluminum-based deodorants -- weird, that never happened before -- but now, my body is more sensitive to the bad stuff, I guess ...  Another interesting side effect of pregnancy?  I don't get B.O. except when I exercise pretty strenuously -- so I don't have to wear deodorant anymore -- maybe once every few weeks and that's it ...  So what about for you non-pregnant types?  They make these deodorant stones -- you can find them at any organic/granola/health store outlet --and they don't contain any aluminum -- pretty cool, huh?  I suggest keeping the strong stuff for those times when you're really pumping out the 'ol sweat, but use the organic stuff the rest of the time ...  I actually have noticed a difference in my memory -- I have a much better attention span, remember things more easily, feel sharper all around -- so who knows, maybe it is the deo ..

         I've recently (last year or so) been struck by how small a space in between the sky and dirt we live in. It can seem vast, with a plane perspective; but when you look up and down there is so much more that you can't even touch by just walking around. This is a picture of Amber on the T-pier on Cross Lake taken when we went to Shreveport a couple of weekends ago.

       . . . morning I go through the same drill. I'm writing emails to various people in the office and I can't think of their names. What is worse is that I can't even look at a list of names and find the person. I look at a list and get lost; I start wondering, "for what was it that I was looking?" Maybe everyone gets like this; maybe I have some sort of "learning disability." Another example of this is one late summer not remembering which color was blue and which was green. It was before classes started, probably second or third grade, and I was cramming newly bought school supplies in a backpack or something. I guess that if I had walked outside I could have remembered, "Oh, the sky is blue and grass is green," but for the moment lived in the abstract world of crayons, pencils and notebooks I couldn't think of it.

        tourin', fishin', hangin', eatin' and cleanin' I spent my  urlLink official day of mourning  with my little sister and Claire. We rode into town and parked in adolph's vacant spot at his apartment and rode the train downtown. We checked out the majestic metro where Wes and Claire will be married on 10th of July. Then, as we headed back to the train station we peeked at the press machines at the  urlLink Houston Chronicle.  Then, we cut across to back to Main St. through the  urlLink Chase Bank building.    We made it to  urlLink Rice University  right on time for the campus tour. My sister was amazed. Claire and I hung back and chatted while Barbara was swept along the tour.  We had a nice lunch at  urlLink Niko's Niko's  and headed back home for a long afternoon nap. Too long, it turns out...  I forgot to pick up Carol at work and the baby from school! I ran out the door at 5:15 got the baby and rushed to get carol. If i wasn't so dumb, carol would have been angry.  Saturday morning we hop in the car and head to my step-dad's house on the San Bernard River. We fished a good portion of the late morning and early afternoon away and finished off the afternoon making some BBQ chicken. We were back home 7, gave the baby a bath and went to Wes and Claire's house for another cookout: hot dogs, salad, watermelon, beer, elote, and guacamole!  On the guest list were two kid-ed couples: the Chavez Family and the Craig, Tea, & Evan family (can't remember their last name). It turned out that Craig really enjoyed playing chess, so we planned a Sunday morning game at the local Panera.  He called around 9:30 this morning and picked me up about 15 minutes later. At high noon we had played two games. One win for killy and a draw.  Once home, Carol and i got ready for Adolfo's first non-family related birthday party! We got to Gymboree, had cake and ice cream, played a few games, and left. It was very matter of fact. It almost wasn't fun at all (for me).  Adolfo IV crashed the second we got home. Hard.  We took advantage of the time and cleaned. Hard. The house was a indescribable mess. Hard.  And now we must go grocery shopping - hard.

Here's a small sample:     I rendered it in Cheetah 3D and colored the resulting tiff in photoshop with three different colored selections with the blend mode set to 'color'.  I also happen to have picked up a chess bug after my game with Paul over the Memorial Day weekend (i wish someone would have taken a picture) that i can't seem to get over. I've been looking closely at the Sicilian and it's variations. I'm still not very good, howerver; I lose whenever i play. It's extremely frustrating.  There are lots of things to do at the house, still. Still, the living room needs more paint; the kitchen needs paint on the walls, there are door stops that need to be installed; screens that have to be put up; plants to be repotted; and boxes to put in the attic. The front yard is slowly but surely starting to come back especially with the recent rains we've been having (and continue having all week!) There are some nearly bare spots that i've been watering for the last couple of weeks in hopes that the grass will reach out and choke out the weeds that have taken root there. The back yard is also making progress on the bare left by the dog of the previous owners. Both Sr. Mercado and I cultivated the ground to make it a little more hospitalbe to regrowth. I've noticed the trail leading to the shed is taking on more grass.  One of the tomato plants in the vegetable bed is looking pretty bad off. I'm hoping it'll be able to recover with all the rain it's getting.  The rose vines out back need some serious pruning, as does the tree out in my front yard. I've been putting it off till i can manage to get adolph over to catch me if i fall off the roof.  Adolfo IV started tumbling classes last week and has taken particular joy in practicing on my bed (or any soft spot he can find). Last night, we rolled around on the bedroom floor and bounced on the bed. He's also become a big fan of Finding Nemo and a certain teletubbies dvd carol picked up at Toys R Us.  Here is a small list of words he uses frequently and accurately: cookie, Nemo, mama, daddy, poopoo, teetee, cheepees (peaches), papa (food), shoes, down, moon, aloe, bye-bye, juice, car, toys, nurse, keys, book, ball, finished, no, cereal, dark, hot, chips....  and a myriad of sounds that he uses to get his point across. He also points at things a lot.  If i've missed any, i'm sure carol will post those to the comments section for those of you who are interested in charting his linguistic progress.

        The Hidden Fortress   If a large weight falls on you and you are thereby trapped, but not crushed, and you happen to know that help won't arrive for several hours but luckily you are within reach of a VCR and a television set and the VCR just happens to have a copy of  urlLink The Hidden Fortress , then I think you can consider yourself quite lucky because the movie is  excellent .

       Garrison Keiler says that there were no significant birthdays today to report on writer's almanac. However, Apple gave birth to a set of speed-bumped  urlLink Power Mac G5's . Interestingly, the dual 2.5's won't come until July and have liquid cooling, different from the rest of the line. The dual 2.5 product number skips a number from the sequentially numbered 1.8 and 2.0 models and when I added it to an order at the Apple store, it had a product number of Z0AC.   In reality, they dropped the mid-range and made the low-end model a faster dual processor, along with dropping the price for both by $500. You can tell that the new dual 1.8 is mother-board similar to the old single 1.6 because it only supports up to 4 gig ram and has standard PCI slots instead of PCI-X.

       Other people may not have this problem, but sometimes I am working on something and I forget where it is in the file system. For example, I was working on a Fireworks document that I exported to html and images in the same directory, but I forgot where exactly that was and it takes some navigating to find.  So, I tried command clicking on the title in the titlebar and presto, the directory heirarchy menu appeared! When I clicked on the directory above (visually below) the file I was working on, the Finder opened up that directory in a new finder window. Perfect!  There is more: If you do the same thing in Safari, you get links to each website directory above the current web-page. There is a slight bug in this though. When I tried it with the Blogger posting tool, it gave directory up links for the URL in the querystring (the part to the right of the question mark) before the document that resides on blogger.com.

       Has gout  Isn't it hereditary??  I heard but don't know as I haven't made time to look that up. What I have made time for though, is to look up affordable housing for my parents here in Houston. That's right, my brothers and sisters are looking into getting my parents to move back to the states where we can help them out more easily and where we can be sure they are doing OK.  With that in mind, anyone interested in making an investment of $45,000.00 for a three year old brand new house in the beautiful and quaint village of Santiago Maravatillo?  This would be a great place for summer vacations, a relaxing, industry free, vestal environment where fresh tortillas and one type of cheese (queso fresco) are available on a dialy basis.  Maybe a summer getaway???  Maybe a place to teach summer classes.  Maybe a sort of timeshare where we can all buy a part in and share it amongst ourselves. Maybe a nice photo lab... Home base for the weary traveler...

        Horrible!   As I walked away from the ATM machine (after withdrawing 150 dollars destined for R.Kane) I remember thinking to myself "Would it not be horrible if I lost my wallet today?"    Well, that is exactly what happened.  Somehow between the Smoothie place and my office (about 100 steps and an elevator ride) I lost my wallet.  Either it fell out on its own, or it had 'assistance'.  At any rate I am now driver's license-less, credit-card less, check-card-less, and 150 dollars-less (actually 300 dollars-less seeing as the money was destined for R.Kane).     Sigh.

        although, a super hero whose power is to collapse their own lung would hardly strike fear in the hearts of evildoers.  Thanks to all for the outpouring of sympathy and good advice. the good news is that my lung is inflating nicely, and NO CHEST TUBES ARE REQUIRED! and that is good news. the downside is that there is absolutely nothing to prevent this from happening again; your prayers notwithstanding.  by that i don't mean nothing CAN be done, just that nothing HAS BEEN done. if i so choose i can pay a medical professional to :   cut me open (with tiny little cuts)  deflate my lung  stick a long skinny tool into my chest  staple up all those nasty little blebs  horribly abrade my lung and chest wall  fill my lung back up  sew me back up  and finally, pump me full of drugs for the next few days.   that is way up there on my list of things to do once i get health insurance. right after my breast augmentation.   and i have been smoke free all day.

'that's odd'  i think, 'maybe i am just sitting funny'  and the pain grows. and grows...  long story short : i take myself to the hospital (again) get shot up, poked and prodded (again) x-rayed (again) and sure enough; my damnhellfuckingcrappieceofgodamnedshitassbastard lung has gone down. again.  luckily for me it is just 'a little collapsed' and i can go home once i find a ride. morphine and motor vehicles do not mix. finlly get a hold of boss paul, go home and sleep 'til now.  the morphine has pretty much worn off and i am hurting again  On the bright side, i found  urlLink this site  for people like me.

        this is mostly for carol, but others may be interested as well.  a really good way to avoid gout flare-ups is to drink more water.  when flare-ups occur use ibuprofen based products, not tylenol or regular aspirin. tylenol has no anti-inflammatory properties, and aspirin can actually make the flare-up worse.  however, if aspirin is being taken daily, for heart related stuff, it should not be discontinued.   this information provided free of charge by diana brewer.

When Kerry was in the wind-up to this statement I remember thinking, "okay, this is harkening back to Dean and the democratic wing of the democratic party, so it must have been the left wing of the hospital." And I was wrong, it was the west wing.

       I saw this link on  urlLink Engadget  and even though I can't read it, it has some pics that demonstrate why the iPod is still on top:  urlLink ?? ?????????? . The site has side by side pictures of the new Creative MP3 player with a current and 1st (or 2nd) generation iPod.  Yesterday I had two different office-chit-chat conversations with people about the iPod and it is remarkable how capable it is. You'd think that some clever people out there would have come up with something better, but the unbadness of the music management software, the magic of the scroll-wheel, and the relative open-ness of the device itself are a winning combination.  It will be interesting to see how Apple manages the  current DRM (digital rights management) challenge  by Real. It is kind of a pity that Apple feels a need to respond at all, since it doesn't seem like Real has an actual shipping product. And whenever Real does ship something, you can be certain it will be some nightmarish advertising engine that makes iTunes look really good.

       I'm overhearing a conversation elsewhere in my office about a wreck and a lawsuit and wanting to sue the lawyer who filed the lawsuit and the answer that lawyers don't sue one another. Over this election season, we're all likely to hear a lot about lawyers, as the Dem VP candidate is one and as its one of the things increasing health care costs. I'm wondering, how often are lawyers sued for malpractice? Do lawyers buy malpractice insurance? When was the last time a lawyer was sued for sleeping during a murder trial or operating a class action lawsuit that benefits themselves more than the claimants?

         urlLink Don't Blog For Me, Argentina: corporate whore : "If you can give them a story that they can give to the next guy, and that guy can give to the next guy and so forth down the line, that is infinitly more importnat than what the graphics look like."  . . . I once read an article about Nike and how the company was all about the transmission of corporate stories.  urlLink This article  was from back in 2000 and I'm certain a lot has changed since then. However, the basics still apply: strong organizations typically have a distinct culture or set of shared values and the parable is the best way to get those across to other people. Jesus had it down pat. If I remember it correctly, he didn't typically say, "do this." More often he told a story and people discovered why they wanted to "do this."

        So Tuesday, my office-mate Ethan says to me that he wants to make something like a conservative NPR. Ethan is a self-avowed conservative--Killy, remember that guy at First USA that was studying economics? Ethan is kind of like that. I'm not sure what he means by conservative. So I say, "Isn't that kind of an oxymoron?" and he acknowledges it but says that he likes the format and information but not the liberal spin.  So we bat ideas back and forth for a bit until I have this idea:  Blog Reading for the Blind . The basic concept is that a modest number of people (say, 30) commit to reading 5 minutes of blog posts into their computers every few days and each day's recordings are put into one mp3 of about an hour that would be downloaded through Bittorrent (a distributed downloading system that would take some of the bandwidth burden off the central server).  I imagine it would be something like  urlLink Houston Taping for the Blind , a service that is directed toward the blind but is freely available to all. I was first exposed to Taping for the Blind through  urlLink KTRU , where sometimes I catch the Houston Chronicle being read.  To demonstrate how easy it would be to record, I pulled out the trusty  urlLink Belkin Voice Recorder  and read a few minutes of an  urlLink article  and imported it into iTunes within seconds and played it back. It worked pretty well. To learn more about hot Houston Taping for the Blind works, I applied to be a volunteer there.

        So, we got back Saturday and I'm feeling this obligation to blog the stuff I wrote about while I was there and also write the stuff I thought about but didn't get around to writing down and so forth, but it just isn't going to happen, so I'll let the  urlLink pictures speak for themselves . It was a great trip.  My verdict on Belize is that it was a really nice time and the accommodations were very inexpensive but the overall value didn't seem better than Mexico. This may have been different if we had spent more time in the interior looking at Mayan ruins, although that would have really meant going to Guatemala. For folks without a comfort level in Spanish, Belize may offer a better value proposition (ignoring travel costs), but since I love honing my pigeon espagnol, that doesn't apply to me.  Our choice of Belize came out of wanting to use as much of our travel vouchers as possible. Round-trip for each of us was about $450, which was under the $500 travel vouchers we both had. We budgeted about $100 a day and ate pretty well but did not take any guided excursions and didn't buy a lot of junk to bring back.  One of the big hassles is that Belize doesn't have the ATM network that Mexico has. In Guanajuato, you can just walk down to the ATM any time and pull out pesos. In Belize, you have to bring a stash of traveler's checks--the bank (and there was only one) only offered cash advances on credit cards and charged a fee to do it. Fortunately, most places seem to be cool with traveler's checks.

       I love the pictures of Belize... I'm dying to get out of Texas for a week or two. Those shots were pretty inspirational-I need to get Tag and I passports for Christmas. Then we'll have to get out of the country. Maybe Belize, Costa Rica, Argentina, Equador, Italia! I love to dream, as long as it's about travelling and not syringes coming out of my head.

       I haven't remembered my dreams in a long time. And with all these wierd clinical schedules, I've been sleeping wierd hours. Like until 10:00am. I haven't done that since SWT! So anyways, I have a 5 week rotation on the oncology floor, and it's all cancer patients getting chemo, recovering from chemo, trying not to die. Just about all of them have central lines, like Jet, with a port under the skin on the chest and a tube going strait to the heart.  Well, one pt. had a central line, an IV in his left arm and one in his right arm. You walk into the room and there are tubes everywhere. One for pain meds, one for antibiotics, one for blood, one for antivirals, one for fluids, and one of IV nutrition. This is who I dreamt about last night. But I must have been him. Talk about empathizing with your patients. It starts out with a surgeon saying he needed practice, so he grabbed me and intubated me. Then he started pushing on my temples. Then I looked in the mirror and saw syringes coming out of my head. Needless to say, I'm creeped out and this can be categorized as a nightmare. I will spare y'all the rest of the details.  I otherwise love this rotation and want to do oncology forever-wierd dreams or not. I love wearing pajamas to work. Liz-on Taggart's desktop

       I have to remind myself on a constant basis not to be so acidic in my evaluation of my work enviroment.   I am suprised and not so suprised to see exactly what is entailed in the full time corpoate gig. The meetings are....well they give one some appreciation of the dilbert comics.    As a designer here, I thought my job would be to make designs that are cool to look at and intriguing in a visual sence. But as it turns out, I am a sales man and what gets approved by the merchandising morons has little to do with being visually compelling, but has everything to do with the B.S. you can spin around it.  If you can give them a story that they can give to the next guy, and that guy can give to the next guy and so forth down the line, that is infinitly more importnat than what the graphics look like.

       it was unlike any dream i have ever had before. like most of my dreams it was in two separate, but somehow related parts.  in the first part i was some type of space marine on a jungly planet (type place). i entered the dream in the height of the action, which was a breakneck retreat from some manner of advancing enemy-alien-lizard thing. while i was terribly curious of what exactly i was running from (and shooting at) the wisest course of action seemed to continue to run (and shoot).  the next part was even stranger. my family, at least my aunt and brother, had gone to vietnam for a vacation. nothing out of the ordinary there. except that i was a vietnam vet. i visited places where i had previously fought and kept having grainy, black and white flahsbacks, all quick cut and jerky. they became increasingly protracted until i came to a building where, in the past, my unit had apparently taken heavy fire. in the 'now' of the dream a bunch of teenagers were having a party. well, i freaked out, knocked some kid down as he got out of his car, stole the car, and drove the hell away.  later i met my aunt and brother for a meal, where my aunt accidentaly spilled another diner's milk.

       As I was perusing Adoph's Itunes Library I saw that most of his albums that he ripped himself were encoded as MP3's. A bit surprised I asked why...."Compatability" was the answer.  I have come across this On-line music store for Independant artists.  urlLink Audiolunchbox .  I realize that this might not have the integration and ease of Itunes but being a Mac user I have been bummed that I cannot shop online for my music elseware.  However Audio lunchbox is Mac friendly and it's product is sold as MP3s, and Ogg Vorbis, and you get get both file types without paying extra.  I am sure Adolph will be sad that he cannot buy the latest Britney, Jessica, Mandy, J-LO, album there but he can find American Analog set, Death Cab for Cutie, and They might be Giants there.

        An Occurance at Bexar Fields in Houston (Wednesday July 14, 2004)  The sky is black and then bright blue, and then black again. I'm only closing my eyes because i can hardly believe what is happening. My leg crawls like a snake; the impossibility of that squeezes my eyes shut. Cumulus clouds, bright blue and sunset orange -- i don't feel pain, but i can't walk. A painful spasm shoots suddenly through my legs.  My calf continues to tighten; i turn towards the earth. The grass is nice here, much thinner than the St. Augustine in my yard; i can smell the moisture in the ground, or it could be the sweat that has gathered on my face. We've been playing now for nearly two hours. Once i am up again it might be closer to three hours, but i'm not counting. I am face to face with the grass, but i roll again on my back. I can't stand up.  I reach down and try to massage my calf which continues to spasm - i can't bend my leg. I can't reach it. I rest my hand on my kness but it feels like someone else is touching it. My leg doesn't feel like my own.  They begin to gather.  The long muscle that i call my calf feels now like a ball just below my knee - did i pop a ligament? is this what this is? did i break my leg? i reach for my calf again, i need to feel it.   I bend my leg with considerable pain but manage to get a hand on my calf. It feels like it's swirling under my skin - some storm or wind swirling about. I immediately think of Eric's boa. It's silky body moved under my fingers the same way my leg is now. I pulled my hand away.  "... my calf..." was all i could manage. Alex, who i was battling for the ball, grabbed my foot, straightened my leg and pushed it forward. As the muscle relaxed, it oozed a slow hot pain. I cringed and looked at the sky (it's much darker now - how long have i been here?)  I limped off the field.  "Pickle juice, do you have some at home? Drink it."  "Pickle juice?"  "Yeah, that will help."  I swallowed down the gallon of water i brought with me. I poured the last of it on my head. With my injury, the scrimmage was called. We were all reminded that the next practice was saturday monring, 9:30.

       My specialty is container gardens, since that's what most everyone's got here in the city. Here's what I do for organic, healthy, gorgeously blooming and growing plants. I start by creating a rich soil that feeds plants for years and years (and, yes, even container plants should have living, vibrant soil, rather than salty gray dead soil that starts to look like chalk or hard, dried out clumps of peat moss over time):  Every spring, about 1 month before the last freeze (in March for most places), I enrich the soil in all my containers (and I recommend my clients with yards do the same).  Here's how:  1)  I remove the top 1-2 inches of soil -- where salts build up -- and throw it out so I can add the good stuff (for yards, you wouldn't need to do this step)  2)  I add some composted pine bark mulch (for acidity and aeration) and some composted manure (for nutrients -- make sure it's COMPOSTED manure -- plain manure is too strong and can burn plants) to the tops of my containers, tilling it in a little to replace the soil I took out.  Compost is the best cure for bad soil -- clay soil, sandy soil, compacted soil, etc.  3)  Then I till in a mixture of greensand (for trace minerals), crushed up egg shells (for calcium), and some Epsom salts (for magnesium)  4)  After the plants are all planted in the containers and after the last freeze, in late April here - probably early April there, I add a slow-release fertilizer (like Osmocote) to the soil surface.  That last about 3 months, so I apply it again at the beginning of July.  5) In May (late April there), all blooming plants and vegetables need frequent fertilization if you want them to keep producing, so I start fertilizing these heavy feeders with an organic fertilizer (you could use a liquid seaweed and fish emulsion mix, or shop around for a water-soluble organic fertilizer, or get that Jerry Baker book and use a home remedy mixture), every 2 weeks.  For all other plants (foliage plants, houseplants, non-blooming plants), they should only be fertilized about once a month.  6) Stop fertilizing everything by August/September to allow plants to slow down growth in time for winter -- even houseplants go through a winter dormant period where they stop growing as much  People always ask me why plants in containers need fertilizing.  They need it even more than plants in the ground because every time you water, some of the nutrients are leached out of the drainage holes at the bottom of the container.  If this sounds like too much work, I recommend just trying to do steps 1 and 4 at least -- you can try doing the other stuff later if you find yourself wanting more blooms, bigger tomato yields, healthier plants, etc.  You can find all of these products at a good nursery -- but, if you're lazy like me you can also order them on amazon.  Hey, if any of you ever have a question about your plants, post a photo on here and I can probably help to diagnose any ailments you have ... just call me the plant lady ...

       not really, but i must say that amber's post has caused me concern.   Also, to anyone new to gardening: Never, ever buy Miracle Gro or any of those other mysterious little blue powder fertilizers. Why? They have high salt content (which damages plants in high concentrations) and they don't feed the soil. Result? In a few years, your soil will be totally dead and devoid of life, including all the necessary earthworms, soil microbes, and beneficial organisms that make soil healthy, alive, and nutritious. Your plants will be fast food junkies hopelessly hooked on blue powders for sustenance because the soil provides no nutrition to them anymore.  does that go for container plants also? should i encourage earthworms to take up residence in my larger containers?  i must confess to having purchased a bottle of said tonic and have applied it sparingly to my plants. i don't want junkie plants! i want them to choose life!

       If you never buy another gardening book again, at least buy this one.  If you have a yard, IT'S A MUST!!!  Here it is: Jerry Baker's Backyard Problem Solver: 2,364 Simple Solutions for Super Soil, Great Grass, Amazing Annuals, Perfect Perennials, Vibrant Vegetables, Terrific Trees, Bad Bugs, and Wicked Weeds  He's got all these kooky home remedies for things, and they really do work. You may wonder why a little soap would be good for a plant??  Phosphates for blooms and root development.  Beer???!  Sugars for metabolic growth and development.  And all kinds of other wacky solutions that will save you money and save us all from dying mysterious deaths from cancer caused by toxic chemicals leaching into the ecosystem in 50 years.  I do disagree with him on a couple of things: Bleach -- don't use it!!!  I'm also unsure about using ammonia -- sounds toxic for the environment to me.  But I absolutely agree on most things, including egg shells for calcium, coffee grinds for acidity, and BIG BEAUTIFUL HELPINGS OF RICH, BLACK COMPOST FOR EVERY SOIL IN SPRING AND FALL  Also, to anyone new to gardening:  Never, ever buy Miracle Gro or any of those other mysterious little blue powder fertilizers.  Why?  They have high salt content (which damages plants in high concentrations) and they don't feed the soil.  Result?

        The Way Home The bus has its own sounds. The creaks and hums and hisses of shifting metal, rubber and bodies are unique to that space ?? that seemingly stagnant time. I am swallowed up the second i step onto the rubber floor (the beeping as the bus drops to allow the old mexican lady behind me easy entrace follows the rhythm of the hydrolic hisses); the engine resonates, the traffic outside becomes nothing more than a hum. I always sit up front in the seats that should be vacated for wheelchairs; wheelchair riders are rare, but i have seen them. Mostly on Montrose, but i remember one downtown not too long ago.  He was an older gentleman, remarkably self-reliant for a guy in a wheelchair. He strapped himself in. The bus driver only had to raise the seat. He left the bus as effortlessly as i might have in front of some assisted living apartments off of Memorial Dr.  A soft bell rings. I never see anyone pull the insulated cord. My eyes are closed. The sweat slowly evaporates off my body. the bus begins to slow down. I shift my body weight forward to keep from being flung off my seat. The bus comes for a jerky stop. From behind my eyelids i can see shadows moving across the bright blood in my eyes. Three people get off. This particular bus idles hard. My legs are shaking shoftly. I am almost asleep.  The bus jerks forward again.. The blood in my eyes is too bright. Summer has arrived. The air condition blows like a long sigh. If i were to open my eyes i would notice the sweaty foreheads and the wet matted hair. The sweat under my shirt has become a cold, itchy layer of salt.  The 50 Heights route snakes through downtown and eventually hobbles up memorial and swings around to washington ave. Today, we stop at nearly every stop, even the obscure stop next to the bread surplus store.  It is 6:05 when i step off the rubber floors of the bus and onto the hot concrete outside. I start to sweat almost immediately. I cross the street staring into the hot reflections of the sun on the windshields of oncoming traffic and think of the brown pelicans that dive bomb into the sheen of hot concrete. I hear that this happens in Arizona.  The further i walk from 43rd, the more muffled the traffic becomes, until it's just a hum behind the sharp shrill of cicadas. I can feel my sweat dripping in between the hairs on my chest. I walk on the east side of the Costa Rica to avoid the sun.  A giant live oak hangs over nearly the entire street right after Libbey. As i walk under it I catch a glimpse of a cicada on one of its low branches. I walk home in as much shade as i can manage to place myself under. I walk in straight lines from one patch of shade to another.  the majority of my yard is shaded, so i decide as i walk up that now is the perfect time for me to cut the grass. I kiss my wife and son, change into shorts and head straight to the shed. The inside of the shed has the wonderful odor of yard work: mud, old cut grass, gasoline, fertilizer, mulch, ant poison, old wood.  I walk the mower through the backyard and am struck by how remarkably quiet it is in my neighborhood. Lovely.

       Stepping off the subway today, I notice a homeless person's grocery cart parked on the platform.  The owner is nowhere to be seen, but the cart bears the trademark anonymous lumps, probably clothes and bedding, hidden inside an assortment of plastic garbage bags.  But the thing that really catches my eye is what lies on top:  A book of sushi recipes.  And so I have to wonder what other necessary implements must also lie within the bags:  Sashimi knife, bamboo mat, sake.  The question that comes to mind is, if you were a homeless gourmet living sans oven or stove-top, wouldn't sushi be the logical choice?  I hear fishing in the East River isn't bad this time of year.  (Thanks Taggart and Adolph for the great feedback on high-speed service ...)

       Paul.....could you type your birthday greetings larger....my eyes ain't as good as they used to be. Thanks for the remembering.  As for Carol and Graphic novels.  Check out Hell Boy and any of Mike Mignola's stuff. that one is easy to find cause of the movie and all.  All of Frank Millers stuff is great. Sometimes the story is a bit thin but the art is great. especially RONIN and his BATMAN and DAREDEVIL also ELECTRA ASSASIN.  But best of all is... JIMMY CORIGAN - smartest kid on the planet. Forgot the artists name but this guy is so powerfully great his ability to organize a narrative it unbelievable. He also has the whole ACME NOVELTY LIBRARY.  good luck.

       Hey Amber Frida, check this out:  urlLink  APOD: 2004 May 28 - A Manhattan Sunset  : "Today, if it is clear, Manhattan will flood dramatically with sunlight just as the Sun sets precisely on the centerline of every street. Usually, the tall buildings that line the gridded streets of New York City's tallest borough will hide the setting Sun. This effect makes Manhattan a type of modern Stonehenge, although only aligned to about 30 degrees east of north."

       Speaking of "excessively trying to monetize the engagement," this Sunday I had the misfortune to shop at Randall's. I wanted to go to Spec's, but they were closed, so I went down to the mid-town Randall's. The little grocery store in San Marcos was a Randall's when I worked there and the chain seems to have gotten sicker. It was as if everything in the place had two prices, the with card price and the higher regular price. I asked a worker outside the meat department for where the pimiento cheese was and the lady walked me to it, offering me jumbo shrimp at such and so a pound, and after hearing me decline, ran through about five more items with prices. It was insane. I felt like saying, "hey, what you are doing is annoying." Instead I said, "hmmm, that tilapia sure is low." (Referring to something directly as low or high when the intention is to refer to the price of something is a strange pet peeve of mine.)  After enduring Randall's, I got to the checkout and couldn't buy the champagne for mimosas. Can't buy alcohol before noon. Why doesn't the ACLU do something about that?

       I've really enjoyed my cable modem thus far. It has been a reliable and fast connection with no tech glitches.   I picked it because there is no contract (my apartment is month to month too), no "activation fee" and somewhat cheaper.  In theory, a cable modem could provide slower service than DSL. The line to a cable modem connects to a larger trunk before it goes back to the cable office. Thus, if all of your neighbors are heavy internet users, then you could see a slowdown. In reality, there is a lot of bandwidth and the cable companies cap their download and upload rates so that there is enough for everyone.  The technical advantage of DSL is that the line in your home goes straight to the telephone company office (a big building with lots of connections and computers sometimes called a "switch"). Nothing between you and the phone company depends on anyone else. However, the electrical requirements of DSL mean that if you are too far from a "switch," then you can't have DSL. In reality, the speed you get with DSL can be lower if you are on the outer limits, distance-wise.  I think the largest advantage of cable over DSL is business model. For phone companies, the connection and data you send are their primary product. They really need to make money from you on the deal. For cable companies, the connection is a commodity component that complements their entertainment distribution model (cable TV). Their bread comes from elsewhere, so they don't seem to be excessively trying to monetize the engagement.  Additionally, while both phone and cable are generally regulated like public utilities, to me cable companies seem more entrepreneurial in spirit and more interested in providing a service. Phone companies seem to me as if they are still coasting along with a monopoly driven bureaucracy in mind.

       From my experience.....there is little. I think it has something to do with subcontracted providers. I use road-runner...which is a cable connection.....however my service and money goes to Time-Warner Austin "The Cable Company". My boss uses earthlink like you do.....and has dsl.....but his service is provided by, plus his money goes  to Southwestern Bell. and he has a contract. When it gets in to the nitty-gritty of details it comes down to how the information is getting to you....meaning cable or telephone wires. The company who owns the wires set the details. Earthlink nor Road-Runner own the wires they just rent the bandwidth....kinda like renting an apartment. I like my cable modem service and I have no contract and was issued a I.P. address. I find that my bosses dsl is slower and he is not issued an I.P. address but used PPoe. I understand how to Finagle and I.P. address so that multiple computers can access the internet on that one I.P. so I am not charged extra. I know nothing about PPOe. My vote is that you go with the cable modem. I am sure Adolph has more info but would probrably agree.

       Hey guys,  Do any of you have recommendations on high-speed Internet service?  We have just been getting basic dial-up from Earthlink, but I am increasingly frustrated with waiting for pages to download and Anthony is finding it takes forever to send images to clients, and he can't send the really big files at all.  I'd like it if we could keep our earthlink service, since that has also become our primary e-mail address and it's a real pain for Ant to change his e-mail address with all of his clients.  These are the options Earthlink provides:  DSL Basic Plan - $40/month, plus $99 activation and 12-month contract  Cable - $40/month with no activation fee and no contract  The second option looks better to me because I'm leary of contracts and it doesn't have the activation fee.  Is there any reason why DSL is better?  Thanks!!!

        Nothing of Importance Happened Today 7.1.2004  I woke up several times last night. I looked up from the bed through one sleepy eye and saw a blurry 2:45 suspended in the black room. Again, at 4:35, still hanging there like a nostalgic apparition, refusing to let go of the room he once inhabited. I closed my eyes twice and forgot about it.  The third time the numbers we're clearer and more precise. Carol got to the alarm clock before i did. I sat up just as she came out of the bathroom. She eased back under the sheets, disappearing under their folds as if she'd never escaped them; the toilet quieted, and the house was quiet as a vacuum.  Every morning i have the same thought when i flip on the massive row of bulbs that line the top of my bathroom mirror, "I'm going to rip those lights out..."  the water from my new showerhead is fast and even. I want to imagine that i actually take quicker showers, now that there is no need to remove the handle and run it along my body to wet myself.  I have to shave too. Four days and i look like a mountain man. Four days and i feel as if i could itch the skin right off my neck - i could stare down at my bloody fingernails dirtied with my hair and skin and say, "ahhhh, that feels nice."  I wipe the steam from the mirror and it instantly appears again. I cover my face in a thin cream and shave quickly with no nicks. I used to nick myself all the time. I always came away with a spot of  blood or two. Now, maybe my face has toughened, or my hands a little gentler -- either way, shaving seems to also go quicker these days; although, i don't think i could attribute that to my new showerhead.  I iron in a towel. I take great pleasure in this. I really can't remember where this comes from. If i troll through my most recent memories, i have always loved to iron clothes. Is is the smell? (the same sense that keeps me away from potpourri?) Is it the sound? (my mothers old ironing board used to creak early in the morning as she ironed. Now that i'm thinking of it, this thought gives me some odd comfort.)  why has this become so important to me recently? the control knob on my iron broke. now, just like our toaster, i have to unplug it to turn it off, and it only works on one setting: extremely, mind-numbingly hot. I wasn't too concerned, though, for most of my ironing jobs (pants and shirts) this is pretty much the setting i would use (maybe a little cooler). If carol ever asked me to iron a shirt for her, i would probably have to turn it down to accomodate the more delicate fabirc of her clothing, but it has been ages since she's asked me to iron anything of hers.  I caught myself staring at new irons at target on a recent trip and was immediately drawn to a $40 or $50 dollar iron much the same way many people might be drawn to a new imac: it looked so cool.  All chrome with a nice ergonomic handle with an open back. The name? The SHARK. "oh man, i've got to have this iron," i though to myself. I walked away before i spent the $50 i didn't have. I am the luckiest man on earth, my mother bought me a new iron for my housewarming. The iron's name? The SHARK. Karma, ladies and gentlemen, Karma.  As soon as i can manage a trip to my mother's house (she forgot to bring it to the party) i'll be ironing up a storm; my shirts, pants, carol's shirts, carol's pants, the baby's shirts, adolfo's little shorts all ironed to a starchy perfection.  I was expecting a fight this morning, but i think he was distracted with a toy he had searched out and become fascinated with. (It would be smart to think that this is what we should do every morning: just give him a toy and he'll be calm as you place him in his carseat. Smart, but mistaken.) It was a mexican toy. the one with a large wooden cylindar with a hole bored into its center attached to a stick by a string (just long enough to allow it to swing up). The object is to swing it up and over and land the stick into the hole. His object is to just hold it and gently place the cylinder onto the stick.  Adolfo, without a fight, sat calmly in his seat and allowed me to lock him in. He was squarely fixed on his toy. I grabbed his lunch, prodded his mother to hurry and started the car.  Traffic was light, mainly because we left early, 6:55. We got to the school about 6 minutes later and dropped him off without a problem. Traffic on the north loop was smooth until we hit 45, but even that moving, albeit, slower.  I made it to the office right at 7:30. David is out for the remainder of the week, Kelly returns from his vacation (straight into Calendar problems i might add) and i have a day crowded with conferences and Dr. Kumar's powerpoint presenation project.  (was it raining?) maybe it's just the air that's wet. i'm wearing a plain white undershirt. maybe i'm hot stepping out of the car; did i begin to sweat the second i stepped out of the driver's seat? My office is hot too. Is the a/c dead in here. The hallway is cool, so i don't even log in to my computer, i walk down the long hallway with my arms raised slightly so the cool breeze will evaporate my sweat. (maybe it was walking up two flights of stairs..) The main office is even colder; brooke is wearing a small sweater while she stares at her computer screen.  Kelly , my boss, is already in a meeting regarding the conference room meeting calendar, which has already seen some problems during its recent implementation. That won't put him in a good mood coming right back into the race, so to speak.  I chat and leave. (my office really isn't that hot, it was just my walking up the stairs.) My office really is warmer than it usually is, but i sit down and forget about it. I begin to like it. I get sleepy, but distract myself with a run to the file room. I pick films up for Neuro-Oncology conference this afternoon. Dr. Silverman zips past as fast as one can walk with a styrofoam cup of coffee. (coffee sounds good).  Sarah, the girl stationed at the film library front desk, helps me sleepily. She had arrived just minutes earlier. I remember that i'm sleepy too. I am on the fourth floor as quickly as i can get there. Here, in the tan zone is a starbucks kiosk manned by an older black lady, i pour myself a Guatemala Antigua, mix in four packets of sugar and a skim milk to the top, and get my frequent coffee drinkers card punched. (two punches, nine to go -- your twelveth is free)  Back at the office, i page dr. kumar, who comes by to re-visit conference cases. He chooses images, i compile them and put them into powerpoint. Donna sends me Dr. Raney's powerpoint file for Pediatric conference which i mesh with the existing presentation. Pat sends me another case for Neuro conference which Dr. Kumar will hate doing cause he's so busy. This month, the neuro staff (Dr's Kumar and Hunter) will get three additional radiologists. A godsend for them. The two of them have been doing 'head' reading for the entire hospital for the last six months or so. To put it mildly, they've been busy.  And the morning flakes away, leaving me in the hallway again, heading to the SBC conference room, where i will load the Pediatric presentations and have lunch. The conference room is cool. Lunch arrives while i am loading the presentation. I eat and fall asleep as Dr. Raney drones on about rare pediatric heart tumors. Does diana fall asleep at these things? I'm sure she does. Dr. H was asleep once. I've seen various fellows sitting there with their bellies full of salad and their eyes heavy with sleep. How much of this is soaking in? Do they retain the statistics?  Back in the hallway to the office. Dr. Kumar and his breath enter once more. He stays in the foyer to my office and reviews the unusally large load of neuropathology cases that are scheduled for review this afternoon. I burn all the pieces to my afternoon conference to disk and wait.  Next week carol and i share a weeklong vacation. Her nephew, alex (isabelle's 14 yr old son) is flying down this saturday for his own vacation. He'll be staying with us. I'm trying to plan some things that won't totally bore him. I wonder if he likes to paint. Carol and i have fantasies of finishing up the kitchen, painting the hallway, bathrooms, and adolfo's room. I've also got ideas in my head to start a woodworking project -- maybe a small bookshelf.  How much we will actually do remains to be seen. I do love to sleep late, i also really enjoy spending time at the movie theater.  the doctors are filing in. some came early and crunched on cookies and sipped diet cokes. others came late, dipped down to avoid blocking the projector view and quickly finding a seat. discussion begins. cases are presented. questions, almost more questions than answers.  the room always fills up twenty minutes after the conference begins.

        Over the last few days, I've had an adventure backing up and restoring my little sister's iBook. It is a computer that I gave to her but didn't completely clean up before I gave it to her. As a result, it had two disk partitions. A 30 gig standard Macintosh partition that was the boot disk and one 10 gig Unix File System (UFS) partition, which she didn't and couldn't really use. As an additional complication, her Firewire port quit, meaning that I had to back up everything over the network, which took a really long time.  This is written as a starter guide for us to all get on a backup schedule and to understand what to do if you ever have to restore.  First off, you have to identify some storage device that can hold all of your stuff. I picked an external hard drive because it was a cheap and flexible. There are caveats to backing up to a hard drive but it is better than nothing.  Second, you need software that will do the backup. I selected  urlLink Carbon Copy Cloner  for the backup because it is widely used and free (donation-ware). Carbon Copy Cloner makes a clone of your hard drive to a disk image. Apple's Disk Utility can use the resulting disk image file to restore the back up onto the disk where you want it.  However, the hitch is that you have to be able to start your computer from a drive other than the one you are restoring to. Unlike with older Macintosh operating systems, you cannot use the Mac OS X installation disk as a boot disk to do a software restore. To get around this,  I used  urlLink BootCD  to create a CD that the computer can start up from and restore the hard drive from the backup disk image created by Carbon Copy Cloner.

Spanish exports to Gibraltar last year totaled 420.3 million euros ($505 million), and imports from the territory amounted to 1.7 million euros, according to Spain's chamber of commerce."  By those numbers, it looks like Gibraltar is a cash cow for Spain, and that nobody there wants to live in Spain. I wonder how many other national territory disputes are there out there: Gibraltar, Taiwan, Guantanamo, Belize (Guatamala claims it), Falkland Islands, Spratley Islands, Cyprus, Kuril Islands, Kashmir, Kuwait, Chafarinas Islands, ...

       So I was thinking this morning: criminals often get caught because their hair or some other DNA-laden material is found in the crime scene. (At least on TV.) What if a criminal purposefully loaded the scene with lots of other people's genetic material? Hair from the barbershop, boogers from under chairs, flakes of skin from old razors--the ultimate criminal wouldn't be an ultra-clean person wearing surgical gloves; they would be a mess of material incriminating anyone but themselves.

        Don't Know how I managed to wake up this morning given that I finally fell asleep around 4:30 or so.  But I am glad that I did because I managed to catch  This American Life .  What a great program!  This particular edition was the one where they try to interview everyone at the  The Golden Apple  in Chicago.  I really enjoyed the texture of everyone's voices.  I also liked the fact that the doors of the Golden Apple have no locks because the restaurant is always open.  I also liked the impression that Donna, the night waitress, gave of how the diner changes as morning comes- how the morning crowd arrives like morning sunlight- slowly, with all freshness and hope of a new day.  But mostly I liked the voices.  I am amazed at how powerful a force of touch sound, in general, and the human voice, in particular, is.  It seems to me that as we lay in the relatively static enviroment of the womb, sound was our first introduction to the variety of physical sensation and to touch.  I often think how amazing it is that I can reach out an touch someone by making the air vibrate between us in a way that is particular to me.  I am amazed out how comforting, how physically comforting a familiar voice is.  I like to think that birds, for example, with their constant chirping are really maintaining constant network of touch;  I like to think of whales somewhere in the deep- alone, speaking and hearing the long slow words of whales.    This thinking explains the power of music.  A group is bound together by a song because the group is literally embraced by the singing.  This thinking helps me understand why a song, rather than an image, seems to to penetrate deeply into our us.  It seems that The Hearing within us is far more ancient- for we heard long before we saw.
