      I had a meeting with my principal in the office this morning.  While I was waiting for him to finish up a few things, I hung out and observed the enormous number of kids who came in tardy.  Each student who is tardy has to come into the office, give an excuse to one of the office ladies and then get a pass written for them.  There were four office ladies busy for at least ten minutes.  What a waste of their time!  What I can't understand is this--school starts at the same time every day.  Students are allowed to come onto campus 20 minutes before school starts.  With that window, you'd think parents could get a handle on arrival time and actually  get their kid to school on time.

      Today is a "Spirit Day", "Twin Day" to be precise.  Students dress like one another and the class with the most "twins" wins... an extra recess.    An extra 15 minutes of time for me, the teacher, to run copies, cruise the staff room for snacks, go to the bathroom or just sit in the blissfully quiet classroom was enough motivation that I gave "Twin Day" as an assignment.  I actually spent 10 minutes of class time yesterday demanding that kids organize their wardrobe choices for today.  I encouraged the exchange of phone numbers, the writing of notes, whatever it took for my class to get the highest percentage of students dressed like twins!  Well, guess what?  It worked!  Now I just have to deal with the fall out of 21 third graders all hyped up because they're wearing the same thing as their friend.  *Sigh* I guess it's better than the "Candy Day" nightmare of 2003...

      Now, when I was in third grade, I was one of these kids.  The "like this?" kid, who never wanted to get it wrong.  Who desperately studied the teacher model, wanting to make mine  just like hers .  As a teacher, I can't stand these kids.  They drive me crazy and I often find my self putting off starting projects I know will cause these kids to jump into "like this?" mode.    I want to tell my students who are so concerned with "getting it right" to just relax.  You are in third grade!  If you can't mess up now, when can you?  No one wants to see 25 identical art projects posted outside the classroom. It's the mistakes, the quirks, that make a third grade project special--something Mom is going to want to keep in a box in the attic.  Explaining this to a third grader would be like explaining quantum physics.  They would all nod their heads, agree with me and then say "So, like this, right?"

      Hippoponomous  I was reading some animal reports and came across the fact that one of the animals was related to the "hippoponomous".  And I had to giggle...and wonder--Is that a hippopotomous that would prefer to remain anonymous?

      We are very,very ready for the end of school. The kids, no matter how early or late the school calendar goes, sense about 3 weeks before school is over and stop.  They just stop--listening, working, behaving.  Therefore, teachers either struggle against the hopeless tide of misbehavior and silliness, or give in and do a lot of art projects (or like me some combination of the two).  My mother, who is also a teacher, has said for years now that what we really need to do is have a surprise end of the school year.  Never really let the kids know when school is suppose to let out.  Just all of a sudden one day tell them "Surprise!  School out!  Go home now!"  We'd all be much happier.

      Thought I'd give this  urlLink Friday Five  thing a try:   1. What was the first thing you ever cooked?  French toast.  It's still my favorite dinner-for-breakfast food.   2. What's your signature dish?  Lasagne for my husband.  For everyone else it's this Taco Soup recipe I stole from my friend Margaret.   3. Ever had a cooking disaster? (tasted like crap, didn't work, etc.) Describe . The first time I made fried chicken it was beautiful, golden, crispy brown on the outside and raw on the inside...   4. If skill and money were no object, what would make for your dream meal?  Tortellini in this amazing tomato cream sauce that a local italian restaurant ( urlLink Mama Stortini's ) makes.  Of course, if I could make it I would weigh 200 pounds.   5. What are you doing this weekend?  My husband heads out of town so it's just me and the baby.  I look forward to cleaning the house and having it stay tidy for longer than 2 hours (but I will miss my husband).

      Over the weekend, my husband had a bad cough and he said to me, "I think I have whooping cough.  Do people get whooping cough anymore?"  To which I replied (in the know-it-all way that I have) "No, there's a vaccine for that.  Hardly anyone gets  that  anymore."  The next day in the paper:   urlLink Whooping cough breaks out at Tacoma hospital  .  Shows what I know.

      I have students who are so disorganized, it boggles the mind.  These are the kids who, when we get down to the lunch room, say "We were going to lunch?  I didn't know that.  Can I go get my lunch box?"  I am a fairly organized person and these kids drive me crazy!  Unfortunately, these are also the kids that need to sit in the front of the room or right next to my desk.  All day long I'm surrounded by them.  And then there are the kids who are smart and funny and really together. I love working with these kids.  They never get to sit by me... *Sigh*

      This morning driving to work, it was so beautiful out!  The sun was just coming up and there was this pinkish glow.  The mountain (Mt. Rainier for those of you who don't live in the Seattle area) was out (meaning there were no clouds) and it was covered in snow.  The shadows were lavender and there was frost on the ground.  It was the kind of morning that tricks Californians into moving here.

        Yesterday I drove up to visit a friend of mine who lives north of Seattle (from where I live south of Seattle) in the pouring rain.  It was about an hour drive which gave me a chance to ponder certain things (and you a chance to see the pettier side of Erin).  Here are some questions I have:  ~Why, in a place famous for rain, hasn't the DOT come up with some sort of drain to put on the road so standing water/hydroplaning doesn't totally #@%! up the commute? ~Why would you stuff that little back shelf in your car with stuffed animals unless you  wanted  to be mocked and ridiculed? ~Semi trucks.  Necessary for life?  I think not.  Get off the road!  Or at least stay in the right lane.   Whew!  I'm glad that's out of my system.  So, the week is over and next week it's back to work.  I can't say I'm really looking forward to returning.  All you out there who are not teachers and work pretty much every week are feeling very sad for me, I know.  Just take a peek at my paycheck before you hate me for my time off :)

      Well, I finished my little sewing project on Tuesday.  And it's not half bad...  Now all I need to do is the laundry piled up on the bed, floor, chest, etc. and someone might even be able to  see  my project.  I haven't been on-line in a few days.  I always have all these grand plans for my time off.  Usually I think something like this--"I'll just stay at home for a change and do nothing.  I'll clean the house, read a book, play with the baby, walk the dogs.  I won't put on make up.  I won't go out.  It will be great."  Then, much like this week, I will make plans upon plans and finally spend one day trying to cram all my chores in.  That said, I have had some fun the last couple days.  I had some moms and babies from my Mommy group over.  Since I haven't been able to go to Mommy group since starting back to work in September, it was fun to see and talk to other moms and see how the babies have changed.    I have also watched some movies on video (No, not DVD--I'm a teacher, remember?  I have no money for fancy-schmancy technology.)  My husband hates my taste in movies so I don't seem to watch many anymore.  Hmmm, since the TV schedule is looking pretty sad for the weekend, maybe I'll go on a video binge...  Rent many girlie movies and stuff myself with low-calorie, fake butter popcorn...  Woo hoo!

      I spent most of my weekend watching the  urlLink Trading Spaces  marathon on  urlLink TLC .  I'm addicted to that show ("where neighbors trade houses for 24 hours and redecorate one room...").  It's pretty funny to watch when the decorator takes over and then the people hate what he/she has done.  Inspired by the show, I spent today at my mom's house watching Trading Spaces and working on a couple of sewing projects.  I've never taken any sort of home ec. class or been taught to sew, but for some reason I always dramatically overestimate my sewing abitlities.  "It's pushing fabric through a machine in a straight line," I tell myself.  "How hard can it be?"  Well, as I found out today, much more difficult than I had anticipated.  I had three projects planned and I thought I could get two done and the other at least started.  I ended up getting one done (the pillows for the chair in our family room are now officially recovered in fabric that matches the new couch), and another started (new pillow shams for the bedroom).  The other (throw pillows for our bedroom--to go with the new shams, of course) I didn't even start.    Since I have all next week off, maybe I'll actually be able to finish the shams  and  get the pillows done before I go back to work...

      I was half watching an old episode of  urlLink Buffy  the other night and the character Willow says "I'm very seldom naughty..".  This little phrase has just been floating around in my head for the last couple days.  Today, while talking with my principal, we started discussing one of my students.  Now this girl is a nightmare!  She's the kind of student that drives teacher's crazy.  She doesn't pay attention, she doesn't do her work, she lies to me  all  the time and she occasionally takes things that don't belong to her. And I  like  her, I really like her.    But when my principal and I were talking today, I realized that she is exactly the kind of girl I would have been if I had had the guts.  I would have loved to have blown off my teachers and just read a book hidden in my desk all day. Or snuck candy all day long.  However, with both my parents being teachers, I was very seldom naughty.  And it still describes me today, although I do try to fit a little bit of naughty into my life periodically, just because I now can...  Hence the name change for this blog. ( Was that a really long story just to get that point?)

      Have you ever had a week where you were soooooo busy that you couldn't complete a task because every time you sat down to do something, you'd think of something else you had to do?  That's this week for me.  I drive myself crazy when I'm like this.  Usually I'm very organized.  I make a list and do things in order and then check things off.  Not so lately...  The end is in sight.  Friday I will complete my report card (and can stop trying to think up nice ways of saying "Your kid would rather talk and screw around than do any work so his grades suck!") and I will, hopefully, stop being so ADD.

      When I was younger (much, much younger), I had this book called something like "The Great Clean Up".  It was all about a girl whose room is a messy pit.  I think her mom tells her to clean it up and she has visions of running away.  Anyways, she does a big clean up (as the title would imply) and her room becomes perfectly organized.  I specifically remember her getting a large cardboard box which she uses to throw away a bunch of junk.  I loved that book.  Report card time is upon us.  As a result of this, and my procrastination as far as putting papers in my grade book, my classroom has many piles of papers everywhere.  I feel the urge to get a large cardboard box and start tossing.  Sigh.  What will actually happen is that I will dutifully enter scores from all of those papers tonight so I can start report cards tomorrow...  Then I'll get that large cardboard box and start the great room clean up.

       Overheard Yesterday...  At the end of each wing of my school, there is a staff bathroom.  The term "staff bathroom" makes it sound much more glamourous than it is.  It's actually a glorified broom closet with a toilet.  But that's not the impression the kids have...  Girl 1:  What is that? Girl 2:  It's the "staff bathroom". Girl 1:   Really?  Girl 2:  Yeah, it's way cool in there.  I was inside said bathroom when I heard this.  I glanced around and almost laughed outloud.  Honestly folks, there is a toilet, a sink, a ladder, and a step stool in there (schools are always short of storage space, so we make do--at one point we seriously discussed storing books in the staff bathrooms).  Nothing on the walls.  Grey, industrial tiles.    It's so easy to impress young minds.

      It snowed last night!  For those of you who do not live in Western Washington (state), this is very unusual, especially for March.  While I was eating breakfast this morning, the phone rang and I was foolish enough to think it might be my school calling to tell me school was late.  Unfortunately, it was my babysitter letting me know that she was sick and couldn't watch baby boy today.  So my morning, which is always a little crazy, just got a little crazier (by the way, I  love  my babysitter and in no way blame any craziness on her.  She is awesome and can't help getting sick.  I just like to complain).    I quickly called my parents and they said they'd take the baby today (they, too, are awesome people).  This means in the space of 10 minutes I need to pack his meals for the day (I always pre-package everything when he stays at my folks), throw some toys in the diaper bag, get his clothes out of the dryer, iron my pants, brush my teeth, and pack my lunch. As I leap up from the table, leaving the remainder of my breakfast untouched, I hear the one sound guarenteed to throw this already impossible plan out of whack.  That's right... the baby woke up early.  Scratch earlier plan.  Run upstairs to rescue baby from crib.  Dress him in ragamuffin-like, too-small clothes.  Swipe toothbrush through mouth once or twice.  Run back downstairs with baby and set him on the floor to play while I pack his meals (and mine).  At this point in my little story you may be asking yourself, "Is she a single parent?"  The answer is no, but my husband is so not a morning person that I might as well be one in this case (he's the night owl and is great when the baby wakes up at 2:30 am though).  So, I manage to get everything together, in the car, and get on the way when I happen to glance at my gas gage.  Shit!  It's almost empty.  Normally, I would just push it and come coasting into the driveway on fumes, but as luck would have it, we have a PT appointment this afternoon.  Now a stop at the gas station is required.    We're finally on the road.  The good news is that traffic is pretty light which is just about a miracle considering it snowed earlier and I live in the Seattle area.  I get to my parents, drop off the baby, make it to school only to find out that I have a meeting and I completely forgot about my tutoring student.    No wonder it's only half way through the day and I'm already wiped out.  Did I mention that the caterpillars for our butterfly unit came two weeks early so I'm now frantically planning for that...

      My class is taking a standardized test of basic skills this week.  It has to be the most boring thing we do.  However, it gives me a chance to observe the kids without them realizing it.  They do some weird things.  I will never understand why third graders are so enamored of pencil shavings.  Yes, that's right.  Pencil shavings.  They try to see how long they can make them with out breaking them.  They keep them in plastic baggies in their desks (which I admit is better than on the floor).  Several of them are playing with them right now.

       urlLink   Radio Tidbits   I commute to work about 35 minutes each way.  Most of this commute time is spent listening to the radio (although I do put on CDs now in then out of commercial frustration).  Here are a couple of the things I've heard in the past week:   Out Damn Santa's Little Helper?  Apparently, this guy has a one man show in which he performs Macbeth using the voices of 50 or so of the Simpson's characters (and I didn't even know there  were  50 Simpson's characters...).  He did a little scene for us radio listeners and it was actually kind of funny.     The song in my head...   urlLink The Indigo Girls  are coming out with a new album soon and one of the last songs I heard Friday morning was their newest release, Moment of Forgiveness.  It's been stuck in my head all weekend.  This is only a bad thing because I know none of the words to the song except the chorus so the chorus keeps looping over and over through my head (with a little humming thrown in here and there just to drive everyone crazy!)   One of my favorite things--Overalls!  This morning, as I was getting ready for work, I boldly made the choice to wear my overalls (it was cold outside and I wanted to be comfortable!).  I usually only wear denim on Friday, but since Friday was a workshop day I figured I was due.  Ironically enough, on  urlLink NPR  this morning they were doing a story about  urlLink overalls .  Coincidence?  I think not.  Fate is more like it.

       1. What's your favorite animal?  Cats.  I envy their lives...   2. What pets have you had in your lifetime?  Several cats, a rabbit, guinea pigs, various fish, hamsters, and dogs.   3. Is there any specific pet that you've wanted but never had? Why?  A horse. It goes with the whole "living in an old farm house" fantasy I have.   4. Are you allergic to any animals?  Nope.   5. Do you have any 'pet' pet peeves (your pets or others')?  Dog hair on everything.  I love our white lab-mix, Honey, with all my heart but there is white dog hair on the sofa, the hardwood floors, everywhere.  I'm always vacuuming or sweeping.  I also don't like dogs that jump up on people (and our beagle does that so who am I to talk...).

      I am exhausted.  Ex-haust-ed.  Which led me to this...   Ah, the good ol' days...  Remember in the days before cable TV and VCRs (can you remember that far back? I can).  We only had like 5 or 6 channels so if you wanted to watch TV, you watched what was on.  Because of this, I remember watching a large number of cheezy movies.  One of the cheeziest (yes, it's a word--I'm a teacher, I know these things) was  urlLink "The Girl, the Gold Watch, and Everything".   For those of you who don't remember the days before cable TV and VCRs and were fortunate enough to have a T-ball game on the night this aired, it's about a guy who inherits a gold pocket watch that has the amazing ability to stop time.  I'm so tired this week that I've had fantasies about aquiring that watch.  I'd stop time (for everyone else--not me) and spend a good straight 16 hours sleeping.  Is it sad how much of my life is influenced by bad TV?

       What every teacher dreads hearing as conference week nears its end...   Student: Uh, Mrs. K? Me: Yes? Student: *long pause while waiting for me to look up* Me: Yes, I'm listening... Student:  My mom wants to know when her conference time is.  She didn't get the slip. Me:  It was yesterday at 2:30. Student: Yesterday?  Oh, well, she wants you to call her then.  What's happened here is one of two things.  Either the kid forgot to give Mom the conference slip and now is in big trouble because Mom missed the conference OR the kid gave the slip to Mom and she spaced out and is now trying to reschedule without having to call and admitt to me that she spaced out on her kid's conference.    Have I mentioned that I really hate conference week? (Tune in tomorrow for a revised sentiment regarding conference week, as I waltz out of here 2 and a half hours early since I stayed until 7:00 for two nights...)  By the way, it's my birthday.  Happy Birthday Me.

      My husband and I have this on-going argument about what would be the best super power to have.  He has always maintained that instant transport would be the best.  I have to agree that instant transport would be really great.  You could instantly transport yourself to a cafe in Paris, wander around the city and then transport home for a good night's sleep and a shower.  However, after my last two conferences (and some experiences a couple of summers ago in Mexico and Belize), I think that being able to understand and speak any language would be a pretty cool power.  Now, if my husband and I could work together with these two powers (like the Wonder Twins) imagine the possibilities!  We could travel anywhere!

       Do You Remember?  It's conference week.  You remember conference week--the panic you felt as your parents came in to meet with your teacher and discuss your "progress" (or lack there of).    In order to accomodate our working parents, we stay late two nights this week.  Which is fine as long as parents show up.  All of mine did yesterday so I'm fairly happy but completely exhausted.  How do people work 14 hour days day after day after day.  I would be wiped out and unable to think after about two weeks. (Although I would be able to go to the bathroom anytime I wanted so there are trade offs...)   Caterpillar Update  Yes, we are "growing" butterflies in my classroom.  This whole endeavor is fraught with peril.  Some kid's caterpillar is likely to die somewhere in the whole process and then it just gets sad.  So far, however, we have 33 caterpillars all still living.  Yesterday, we transferred each creepy crawlie to it's own little cup, complete with stinky food (it's green and almost gel-like in consistency--it smells  so  bad!).  Today, the kids handle them for the second time.  I'll keep you updated on there survival rate...

      The baby has been sick.  Throwing up and...uh, other bodily fluids sick.  This is the first time he has been really sick since he was born.  It hasn't been fun...  The good thing is that I've stayed home with him for the past two days and even though he's been running a temperature as well as the bodily fluid things mentioned above, he hasn't been particularly cranky.  In fact he's been tearing around the house with his little cart as usual.  Other than taking care of the baby, I've been really boring this week.  Get up, go to work, come home, go to bed, repeat boring.  Since we were actually back on our regular schedule for the first time since February, work has been really busy too.  I've been trying to get the kids settled down and back into the routine.  They have actually been great (although since I took two days off, we'll  prob'ly have to start  that  process all over again on Monday....) so that's the end of my excuses.  OK, must go to bed, get rid of this headache and hopefully become coherant tomorrow.

      So, my weekend was basically spent recovering from my week.  Baby boy didn't sleep through the night on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday so by Saturday I was so sleep deprived, I was verging on tears.  After two naps and getting nothing accomplished on Saturday (except making some passible enchiladas for dinner) I felt a little better and was able to actually sit down with my husband to watch  urlLink Trading Spaces . (It's one of our favorite show.  We love to watch the teams argue with the designers)  Sunday was spent being productive--grocery shopping, buying a new baby gate for the stairs (unfunny husband story to follow), cleaning the house.  It wasn't until we were on our way to my parents house for my (belated) birthday dinner that I even realized it was St. Patrick's Day.  In my other, younger, non-mom life this oversite would have been unthinkable.  C'mon, I'm half Irish and my name is Erin for God's sake (which was always good for a free beer in the old days).  Ahh, how times have changed...  Now for the...   Unfunny Husband Story   Saturday night, I'm making dinner while Bill, my husband, is upstairs doing who-knows-what in his study (paying bills is what he tells me but how many bills do we  have ?).  I digress.  The baby is pushing his cart at breakneck speed all over the downstairs until Bill comes down to get something and then goes back upstairs.  The baby, unbeknownst to me, decides to follow Dad upstairs.  I don't realize this until Bill says, "What are you doing up here?"  Well, I kind of freak out a little because the baby really shouldn't be climbing the stairs by himself and has never done this before.  I go and get the little tyke and am about to move one of the baby gates blocking the living room to the bottom of the stairs.  Bill, who is in the process of emptying the garbage cans, tells me no, no, no.  The baby wants to climb the stairs.  He's a boy.  He's tough!  Besides, says my husband, he is right there watching the little guy. OK, OK, I'll stop the overprotective mom bit but I remind my husband to stay right behind him so he can catch him if he falls.  Bill then basically tells me yeah, sure, whatever.  I go back to making dinner and I can hear Bill and the baby upstairs looking at pictures together.  Not two minutes later my husband frantically calls my name so I drop everything and run to the stairs, just in time to see the baby rolling down them.  Bill had reached down and was able to slow his progress by catching his shirt but couldn't hold on.  I scooped him up after only four or five stairs and he wasn't hurt but was really scared.  Showing remarkable restraint, I thought, I did not say "I told you so" to my husband.  He was a little freaked out and I thought that got my point across. However, later that night as we are brushing our teeth Bill starts giving me a bad time about stains in the sink and being lax on my job (of cleaning the bathroom).  I comment back that after he fell down on his baby watching resposibility in a big way that day, maybe he shouldn't talk.  He then has the nerve to say to me "I wasn't watching the baby, you were.  I was emptying the garbage cans."    I was speechless.  I explained to him that  he  had said he would watch the baby, that I was  downstairs  and he was  upstairs  with the baby.  He honestly did not seem to get it.  Now Bill is not dumb.  He probably has just shy of a genius IQ.  But nothing I said could convince him that he was in charge of the baby at that time.  Weird...

      I watched the Awards last night (like everyone else, apparently) and thought they were just OK.  Was it just me or was Whoopi not very funny?  That could be the exhaustion talking.  Yes, it was another fun day where I got to work, pick up the baby, go straight to the pediatrician's office, then the pharmacy and then home.  The little guy is still sick.  Now he has an ear infection so I'll be taking another day off work to stay home with him tomorrow.  I think his babysitter was a little pissed that I dropped him off today.  She said he cried all day.  I feel badly about that but I really didn't think he was that sick this morning.  Yesterday he was OK, not 100% but alright so...  OK, laundry, clean the kitchen, call the babysitter, then maybe (cross your fingers for me) a hot bath and a bad novel.

      How annoying.  I just lost a couple paragraphs when I did something (I don't know what) on the keyboard.  Back to what I was saying, paraphrased of course.  Yesterday was Opening Day of baseball season.  I now know that because of my husband.  Until I met him, I would never have watched a game on TV much less gone to one in person.  But my husband's family is a big baseball family, and I don't just mean big fans.  His uncle played for the Yankees in the late 1930's and early 1940's (with Joe Dimaggio, Yogi Berra and Lou Gherig to name a few).  Bill's dad played for the Washington Senators and when the team moved to Texas he moved right along with them and went into the management end of things.  So when I first started dating Bill and his folks would tell stories (and they  love  to tell stories) it took me a while to catch on that Ted, who was so mad he stormed out of the hotel room and into a closet, was Ted  Williams .    Now I'm a baseball fan.  I can keep score and do it better than anyone else in his family (they never keep track of balls and strikes).  I also can tell you if it was a 6-4-3 or a 5-4-3 double play and know the seven ways to get on base.  Go figure.   Happy Birthday Baby Boy!  It's my little guy's birthday.  He's one and so cute.  I hope he has a great day.

      Hi, I'm back.  This week has been crazier than most (and for an elementary school teacher that's saying something!).  We performed out "Tall Tales and Heroes" musical extravaganza last night and it was great...well, good...OK, it was cute in that little kid performance way.  Like most things in elementary school, we were at the mercy of the parents.  About a third of our chorus didn't show, as well as 2-3 speaking parts that had to be re-cast last minute.  But it's done and next week is Spring Break so enough about that!  One of the best things about teaching is the time off.  I'll admit it.  I love Spring Break, Christmas Break, Summer Break, Mid-Winter Break and all the assorted federal holidays that we get off.  One of the worst things about teaching is the fact that you don't make enough money to go anywhere or do anything on all these breaks.  So I'll be spending Spring Break at home with the baby and dogs (my husband was off this week).  I plan on sleeping in as long as the baby will let me and maybe getting a little reading done.    What I would like to do during Spring Break (besides a trip to Italy, or Arizona or anywhere sunny and warm) is get myself organized for the last 9 weeks of the school year.  Clean out closets and stuff at home, get caught up on grading and planning at school.  However, I'm a realist and I will be lucky to get the Cheerios swept off the floor before the are pulverized this week. *sigh*  Maybe I should drastically lower my expectation and plan of going back to work with the house a total wreck and no lesson plans for the week.  Then anything accomplished will be a nice surprise. :>)

      For the second time in a little over a year, I was alone at my house yesterday.  The husband took the baby and the dogs to the grandparents house and I was blissfully alone.  You need to understand that I love the above mentioned husband, baby and even dogs.  However, I have always been a person who needs more alone time than most.  In fact when my husband and I were dating, Wednesday was "Alone Night".  We would stay at our seperate apartments by  ourselves.  In the space of one afternoon I was able to:  ~Make a trip to Old Navy to purchase some new spring clothes. ~Stop by Target to pick up some shoes to go with said clothes. ~Clean the entire house, including the master bathroom (including the gross shower floor). ~Make dinner, eat dinner and clean up from dinner in a consecutive fashion. ~Do my nails. ~Watch "The Big Chill" on AMC (favorite line: "Nobody ever said it was going to be fun.  At least, nobody ever said it to me...")  Amazing what I can accomplish when my attention is not split in 7 different directions at once.

      So, I haven't been very good about writing lately.  This is not the best time of year for teachers.  After Spring Break, time seems to accelerate at the same time you realize that there are several important things you meant to teach this year that you haven't gotten to yet.  Staring at your plan book in a blind panic, you then attempt to schedule all of these miscellaneous lessons and realize that it's just not going to happen.  By the way, I didn't get anything accomplished over Spring Break like I had planned. My parents bought us a computer (it's a long story) so I spent my spare time setting it up and arguing with my husband about where in the house we'll put it (doesn't the study seem like a logical place to you?)

      OK, I'm back (she says as if she just ran out for a cup of coffee and came right back.)  Yeah, I know it's been two months but I was busy and well, you know how that goes...  I'm on summer vacation now and lovin' life.  If I could just find a job that pays me to be home year round, then I'd be set:)  Unfortunately, when you work at home (from what I understand) they expect you to do actual work for the company and not household chores.  That's too bad.  How about some highlights from the last two months?  Here we go: ~My principal informed my "team" (me and the others who teach third grade) that we will be moving to the portables next year.  We are, of course, the grade level with the most behavior problems but, hey, I'm sure those kids will have no trouble running in and out of the building without any supervision.  ~I got a student teacher for next fall!  Yes, shortly after we got the news that we'd be moving to the portables, my teammate Natalie, who is in the middle of a high-risk pregnancy, blew a disk in her back (hmm, stress have anything to do with that?) so her student teacher got transfered to me.  She was out the rest of the school year and will be out all of September as well. ~I found a new babysitter for next year.  The baby sitter from this year is going back to school next year.  So you can see, you didn't miss much.  I'll try to update more often this summer since I should actually have time!

      I commute about 30 miles (each way) to work every day with my two sons, Nolan, a 2 1/2 year old and Mason who is 6 months. Most of the time, especially in the morning, it's very quiet. We listen to the radio or sing songs. This morning, however, there was a bit of drama that went something like this...   Nolan: Mama, Mama, Baby Brudder has sea otter book.   Me: (listening to NPR with one ear) What? Mason has your book? OK.   Nolan: Mama, Mama, Mason has my book! (much louder voice)   Me: Honey, I'm sorry. I can't get it for you right now. I'll get it for you as soon as...   Nolan: (yelling loudly) No! Baby Brudder, no put book in mouth! Mama! Sea otter book! Give me my sea otter book!   Me: Nolie, Mason is just a baby he doesn't understa...   Nolan: (in sweet two year old voice) Thank you, Baby Brudder. Thank you for give sea otter book.   So maybe Mason does understand...

      The first year I taught was really hard.  And I was lucky--I got hired at the school I student taught at so I knew the staff but it was still hard.    My friend Amy was on my "team" of first grade teachers and we helped each other whenever we could but it was only Amy's second year so she was still kind of clueless.  Diane was also on our team.  She was a veteran teacher of 20 + years.  She was a big help but she had so many ideas and stuff it was kind of overwhelming.  Julie was the final member of our team.  She had been teaching for 4 or 5 years so she still remembered how hard that first year was and she was so calm and reassuring.  I went to her a lot.  Julie was one of those people who was just born to be a teacher.  She had her first graders wrapped around her little finger.  She never had to raise her voice.  They adored her so of course they would do whatever she asked.  She was also one of those really creative people.  The McGyver of decorating.  Just give her a paper bag, some raffia and a branch of dead leaves and she'd have a stunning centerpiece whipped up in no time.  Every wall of her house was painted a different color and it looked good.  And she was gracious.  The kind of person who brought a little gift whenever she visited your house--not because she felt like she had to but because she wanted to.  A little over two years ago she was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor.  She immediately had an operation and followed up with radiation and then chemo.  She went on to have several more operations but the tumor always came back.    Julie died yesterday morning at home surrounded by her family.  In a way I'm glad she didn't linger too long but I'm also going to miss her.

      I need to consume less chocolate.  A. Lot. Less.  It seems like a good life goal right now...  And on a related note, I'm off to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned.  Anyone else find the enlarged spaces between their teeth strangely disturbing?

      Here's what I hate about conference week.  I started teaching when I was 22.  I've been a teacher for almost 12 years now.  I know how to be a teacher and what to do with kids who aren't doing what they should in the classroom.  I've been a mom for almost 3 years.  I have never had a third grader of my own at home.  I have a pretty good idea about how we'll handle homework and chores and all that but you never know.  After all my kids weren't going to watch TV, either (ha ha, that lasted all of 8 months).  So I hate having to tell parents--parents who have been doing this parenting thing for at least 6 years longer than I have--how to be a parent.  Should I really have to tell these people to NOT let their children watch TV if homework isn't getting done?  Or to yank them out of sports if they are failing EVERY subject?  Only three more conferences to go...

      So, why did I choose to wear big, flashy (painful) earrings on the day I have phone conferences?  Must have been to make it that much easier to talk with all my English as a Second Language parents on the phone...  Yeah, that's it.

      I heard or read somewhere that the Inuits (Eskimos, if you aren't pc) have over 50 different words for snow.  Here in the Seattle area it's kind of like that with rain.  It can be misting, sprinkling, spritzing, spitting, raining, drizzling, showering, pouring...  Today it's pouring and it has been all day.  That's actually kind of unusual for Seattle.  I mean, it rains all day a lot but usually it only pours for a hour or two and then shifts to one of the other rain styles for a while.  Rain means one dreaded thing when you are a teacher--rainy day recess.  Remember when you were a kid and you LOVED rainy day recess.  You got to play lame board games and go crazy in the classroom like you normally wouldn't be allowed to do.  Well, let me tell you, as a teacher it sucks.  Kids get hyped, really hyped, about being able to stay inside. That means trying to get them to settle down to do something as uninteresting as a math test is next to impossible.  If I could harness the energy in my classroom at this moment, well, let's just say I wouldn't be paying power bills anytime soon...

      An old boyfriend recently emailed me completely out of the blue.  We hadn't spoken for ten years.  He's on "sabatical" for a while and decided to Google me.  We had lunch the other day and it was good to see him.  We talked about everything from reality TV (we both watch, but different shows) to musical taste (Jazz? Really?) to image consultants (he'd been to one, I haven't).  What really struck me about this meeting, for the first time in ten years, was how the same he was.  His inflections, his wording, his sense of humor were all the same.  But he was different too.  More centered, his self assurance rang more true.  Now, here's the thing--can we be friends again?  I don't know. He was  that  boyfriend for me. The one you break up with, then make up with again and again.  At one point in my life I was totally convinced I would marry this man.  He was my soul mate.  Now we're both married (to other people, obviously) and he is someone else's soulmate.  I'd like to try for friends, I really have missed him but the complications seem overwhelming.  It seems to me that married people are rarely friends with a member of the opposite sex unless it's a couples friends thing.  So, I guess we'll see.  I emailed him last, thanking him for the lunch and now it's his turn.

      Three things I wish my son didn't know:  1. Green means go and red means stop--This would prevent a lot of yelling while driving together.  Whenever he sees a stop light he scream either "Green, Mommy!  Go faster, go faster!" or "Red light!  Stop, Mommy!" (which is better than when he just yells "Stop!", making me think he knows something I don't).  2.  That Dairy Queen and Baskin Robbin sell ice cream--For obvious reasons.  3.  Please and a sweet smile will get you almost anything--Especially from Daddy.  Oh, who am I kidding?  From mommy, too.

      I dream of living life in a Pottery Barn catalogue. Each room would be perfectly, casually furnished with a Sabrina basket, clearly labeled on the liner mind you, for every storage need.  The house would never be messy, unless if was the perfect Pottery Barn for Kids art project.  And then the materials would be put away immediately after project completion and the precious work of art would be framed and hung to complete the rooms decor.  I would spend my time creating healthy, delicious meals in the spacious kitchen with adorably mismatched dishes on the rolling island or curled up in the chair and a half reading a book by the light of the silk shaded lamp while sipping a glass of white wine (red wine, if spilled, might forever stain the natural sisal rug covering the gleaming hardwoods).  The kids would be perfectly attired and never covered in various bodily fluids or remnants of their lunch.  I would be perfectly attired and never covered in various kid bodily fluids or remnants of their lunch.  Family outings would consist of leisurely piling into the Land Rover with all of the necessities packed in the perfect-for-the-job tote bags/coolers/backpacks and taking a happy family drive to the nearest family attraction (zoo, park, amusement park).  We'd sing songs as we drove along, never getting lost, snapping at each other or spilling food and drink on the supple leather seats.  Evenings would consist of the gourmet meal mentioned above and then, the kitchen somehow magically spic and span again, a family game night where no one cheats, loses their temper or has a melt down.  At the end of a long day I would climb into my gorgeous, coordinated bedroom set, snuggle down into the 400 thread count sheets and fall asleep secure in the knowledge that my life was sooo much better than anyone elses.
