      Anybody out there wondering why every time the secretary of state  urlLink Colin Powell  gives his speech regarding his "proof" that Iraq is a threat, and they dissagree with him, he makes a threat about that particular institution's future existence?

       urlLink Here's  something that ought to make your stomach turn, fresh from the AP.  American protesters denied the right to assemble near the UN building to protest because of the security risk that poses.  They're using the shadow of something that happened a year and a half ago to justify denying you your freedoms.  "Vote freedom first" the republicans said.  As if. Open your eyes, people.  Your personal freedoms are being eroded on an almost daily basis, and the only people talking about it are the  urlLink alternative press , not the pro-corporate media giants like ABC and Fox.   "They that can give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty or safety."   --Benjamin Franklin    "America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves."   --Abraham Lincoln   Want to get even more pissed off? Go read the comic of the master political cartoonist Tom Tommorrow,  urlLink This Modern World .     Need to calm down? Go check  urlLink this  out.  It's a great semi-collaborative art page.

      Keeerist.   The AP says that we aren't getting enough snow here in Denver to offset another drought year.  Read all about it  here .     Whaddaya mean, global warming?    Kyoto Now!  It's not just a clever song from everyone's favorite thesaurus-toting  urlLink punk rawk  band.  Think before you decide that you can't live without that Escalade or Land Rover or whatever.  Keep it in mind that the guy running the show right now is a former oil exec and has at least three (that I can think of at this late hour) cabinet members with strong ties to big oil.  What does that mean to you?  It means no one is gonna do it for you.  It means no one is gonna make a law or make something illegal, it means that you (yes YOU) are going to have to be the agent of change.  Consume less, give back more.  Use earth-friendly  products .  In a very real sense, the fate of the earth is in your hands. Don't fuck it up.  Bunker Out.

       News Flash from the Secretary of Disinformation   I just saw Press Secretary Ari Fleischer giving a  urlLink press conference  from the White House.  In the course of this conference he said "Some Democrats view the lesson of the last election is to go out and to run as far to the left as possible. The reemergence of the liberal wing of the Democrat Party is in full swing"(source: White House Web Page- Follow above link).  If this were true, I'd write him a letter asking who these people were, 'cause I haven't heard a damn thing from them lately.

Fred Rogers was a good man and he will be sorely missed. Some of my earliest memories are of watching Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.  I remember enjoying having a program where the theme wasn't just educational; after watching it you got the impression that Mr. Rogers genuinely cared about you and didn't think that your problems were just "kid's stuff". Fred, here's to you, my friend.

       Faygo And Other Musical Trends  I had a strange night at work last night.  When I arrived for my shift, I found the store full of oddly dressed high school students, some of them in clown make up.  That's right, we had an in-store appearance by  urlLink Zug Izland , one of the bands on the  urlLink Insane Clown Posse 's label  urlLink Psychopathic Records .  I got a chance to talk with them later on in the evening, and when asked why they were in Denver, it wasn't to do a show, it was to "spread the love to all the Denver Juggalos".  Needless to say, it was one of the most retarded nights of my life.  I have a picture of myself and the band, which I will post if I find the money to get the blogger plus.  The funniest thing that happened that night?  They asked all of us to come party with them back at their hotel, which Arianna (my co-worker) was down with because she likes the way their songs talk about "smacking their hos". (her quote not theirs, their music was blaring but I never bothered to listen to the lyrics after I heard something about a  urlLink Faygo  Carnival)  Oddly enough, the CD of theirs that we played had a cover of a song from the Lost Boys soundtrack.  I had a great night, and I want to thank Zug Izland and all the Juggalos and Zuggalos out there for making it posible.  You have discovered new heights of retardation, and I salute you.

       "Could This Be The Legendary Go Time?"  Well, here it is.  The time has expired.  I watched the end of the count-down on MSNBC's "Countdown Iraq".  You could almost feel Lester Holt's struggle to keep from counting down the last seconds, new years style.  The dude had this grin on his face the whole time like he was doing a Superbowl pregame show or something.  Their graphics were likewise x-treme.  They had a night vision shot of the Baghdad skyline in splitscreen the whole time, so that we could catch the very beginning of the carnage, as if it were to come at that exact second.  Lester's disgust with the fact that he didn't get to show the world a veiw of the first bombs falling was palpable.  It was entertaining to watch him go from almost creaming his jeans in pre-war x-tacy to bitter, bitter dissapointment.  Meanwhile, MSNBC continued to interupt coverage with viagra comercials and other bits of commerce.  My favorite part was when they spoke with another one of their correspondants in Kuait near the border.  Apparently, this large network could only afford to send him into the field with the webcam that they got for free from Earthlink.  Somehow, everyone else had normal cameras, and his was this crappy, blocky, distorted thingey.  Perhaps this is their attempt to provide some sort of "gritty realism".  What a crock.   P.S. Title quote is from page 47 of  urlLink Buttlord GT .  Afterthought: Has anyone else noticed what a group of shills for the Republicans MSNBC are?  i.e. Their own show hosts telling people who are against the war to "shut up" (yep, actual quote).

Hell in a hand-basket, here we come.  I'm so glad all you republican morons out there elected these dangerous fools so that we can all die in a war.  Thanks a fuckin' ton.  And while I'm at it, fuck Al Gore for not being able to beat this drunken coke-head schmuck.  Eight years of peace and prosperity, and you can't beat a jackass alkie executioner from Texas?  Don't give me your whining shit about Nader, either.  Gore's election should have been so sound that giving up three percent of the vote to Nader wouldn't have been any kind of concern.  Instead, he couldn't even beat the governor who authorized more executions than any other in American history.  Fucking ineptitude. Hey, elected democrats!  Grow some fucking balls!  Pansies!  P.S.- All you assholes who don't vote share the blame for this.  Get off of your asses and vote, before you loose the right.  Otherwise, fuck off.  You have no right to bitch about anything.

       Rapper's Delight  What a day.  The record store I work at had a visit from four recording artists today to do autographs and hobnob etc.  Yep, I'm talking about  urlLink Common ,  urlLink Talib Kweli , and  urlLink Blackalicious .  I got a chance to say hi to all of them, and I got a few pictures (I'll post em when I find enough money) and a few autographs.  Needless to say, people were lined up around the store to see these guys.  They had a few people with them, to help out with crowd control and whatnot.  They also had a guy filming the whole thing.  It was pretty cool, 'cause a few of the "lyricaly well-endowed" were freestyling for the camera.  Some of them were actually really good!  This crowd was way more laid back and fun to be around than those Zug Izland chumps. I felt bad for Blackalicious, since they were added to the bill late in the game not many people knew they were there, and even fewer knew who they were.  I had heard Talib Kweli and Common before, and I like their stuff, but I was new to the Blackalicious sound.  They were such nice guys that I went and bought their album anyway.  In case you are wondering, the album is fantastic stuff.  You should buy it  urlLink right now  even if you don't like rap, that's what nice guys they are.  I wish I had the cash to go to their show.   The Award For Coolest Boss Ever Goes To...  I just wanna give huge thanks to the man who helped me get my car back from some thievin' towin' bastards.  You know who you are. Thanks a whole lot man, that is definately the coolest thing an employer has ever done for me.  Much love and mad props.

       Parade Of Assholes   urlLink Lycos News | House Clears 2004 Budget, Tax Cut Plan  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed a $2.2 trillion federal budget projecting record deficits while paving the way for up to $550 billion in new tax cuts sought by President Bush.  Goddamn it.  We have a war going on that is going to cost in excess of 100 Billion dollars, and they dump out a tax-break for the rich.  Sweet.  Did you read that?  RECORD DEFICITS .  This is what we get when a man who couldn't even figure out how to say "nuclear" the right way is running the show.  This is what we get when CEO's and Board Directors get cabinet and staff positions.  A tax cut for the wealthiest 1% and debt for you and I.  Not to mention the fact that this money is all going towards the military and contracting out post-Iraq work to their best buddies.  If they were the "Christians" they claim to be, they'd be running us into the red to make sure that we have the finest educational and health systems in the world(especially with SARS running rampant), instead, they reveal their true nature by gutting our financial future and giving it to the people who need it the least, their fat rich white friends.  If you think that the majority of their boost in military spending is going to our precious troops, wake the fuck up.  It is going to the people over at Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas.  We have to replace the ordinance we used up in our orgy of "shock and awe" bombing.  All you Republicans can suck my ass.  You've sucked my blood long enough.  Fuck you George W., and fuck you Congress.  Let's see if anyone in the Senate remembers who they're supposed to work for.  Last chance to prove me wrong, whores.  November 2004 can't come soon enough.   Special P.S.to George W. Bush- Ok, Baghdad has fallen.  Whoopee.  You finaly fixed the dubious at best problem your daddy's boss made.

       Putting A Face To The Term "Collateral Damage"   urlLink This  is what I am talking about.  Not suitable for small children or people who think the war is going to help anyone.  Damn you and your bullshit war, Bush.  His blood and that of every other person killed in this greed-fueled vendetta is on your hands.   When In Doubt, Spin.  Anyone remember when this war was supposedly about getting rid of Iraq's weapons of mass distraction er, distruction?  Now, all of a sudden, I see the unelected shrub on the news with our British lap-dog talking about liberating the Iraqi people...  Tell me, U.N. Security Council resolution 1441, did that say anything about liberating them from the oppressive Hussein regime? Not that Hussein isn't one evil fuck of a person, but the main  legal  justification for this war was 1441, a document that was all about weapons and disarmament.  I am pretty sure it didn't say anything about liberating anyone.  Maybe this sudden change in tack has something to do with the fact that they have captured 75% of the country and haven't found so much as a used kleenex, let alone any kind of cache of Biological weapons capable of reaching the U.S.  Ask the kid from the article above this one whether he feels liberated or not.  And if Saddam is so evil that we have to liberate his people, where does our sense of "moral decency" draw the line?  Does it draw the line in Saudi Arabia, where they regularly send money to terrorist groups?  Does it end in Chinese occupied Tibet where Buddhist nuns are sexualy assaulted with tasers?  Or what about Iran, where a woman can be stoned to death if her husband, just one man, says she has been unfaithful?  If liberation truly is the desire of the current American "regime", why are Bush and his fellow autocrat-wannabees trying to introduce the Patriot II act, a document that guarantees the sharpest decline in personal freedoms that this country has ever seen?  If he was telling the truth about a will for liberation, we could be in for the most enormous, cataclysmic war the world has ever seen.  Fortunately for us, Bush is about as aquainted with the truth as a blind man is with the beauty of a Piccasso.  And during all of this, where is our mighty free press?  Oh yeah, they're whores.  I forgot.  Why disagree with our government when our corporate overlords will fire us for it.  That's right.  For all you media prostitutes out there, to paraphrase Scott Adams, here's a tic tac box, keep your concience in it.  Knowing our press, they should have plenty of room for their sense of decency and sense of duty as well.  P.S. -  They had the extreme bad taste to do this press suck-off from Northern Ireland, a counrty ripped apart by it's own attempts at liberation.  Way to go Bush, I set the bar extremely low for you, and you keep surprising me with how low you get.

We have all these bombs, planes, spy satelites, and spies within Saddam's inner circle, and we need someone to show us where these WMD sites are?  Or, perhaps they don't actually exist, and there was an ulterior motive for this war.  Nawwwww, Dubya wouldn't do that would he?  Oh, yeah, he would, that's right.  Fuckers.

       We're Motörhead, And We're Gonna Kick Your Ass  Those were the first words I heard legendary bassist Lemmy speak at the  urlLink Motörhead  show on Tues.  What a show.  There were two opening acts, the first of which I cannot remember the name of, since I only saw them perform two songs.  No worries, they were crappy rap-rock anyway.  The second band was  urlLink Planes Mistaken For Stars , a great band out of Peoria Il. They put out a great set while simultaniously being drunk off of their asses.  They sound kind of like a really pissed off  urlLink Burning Airlines .  Then Motörhead came out, promised to kick our asses, and delivered.  My ears are still ringing two days later. Definately one of the most violent mosh pits I have ever encountered.  If you have the means, I highly reccomend going to one of their shows, but bring earplugs if you want to be able to hear anything at any point during the rest of say, your life.

       Something We Already Knew   urlLink Lycos News | U.N. Council to End 13 Years of Sanctions on Iraq  "The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But after Saddam's fall, the United States argued they should be quickly lifted.  The resolution would give the United States and Britain broad powers to run Iraq and sell its oil to fund reconstruction until a new government is set up" Well, duh.  Who didn't see this coming?  Betcha Haliburton or Bechtel or the Carlyle Group gets to oversee the sale of all that oil.  The Bush Regime now acts as though it has nothing to fear from the truth of it's intentions.  Why?  Because the press and the Democrats are too fucking scared and weak to do anything about it.  Welcome to the future.  They parade their original intentions before the world stage, and by dropping the sanctions, give their greedy brothers-in-arms around the world a whiff of the wealth that will be leached out of the Iraqi soil.  Who will speak against them if the other countries are guaranteed a spot at the trough? Goddamn it people, this is  not right , and you all know it.    P.S.-  Here is another chunk of that same article.  Remember why we went to war in the first place?  Yeah, Dubya doesn't either.  "Before the war, President Bush repeatedly accused Iraq of having illicit weapons of mass destruction and said it would have to be disarmed by force. So far, no chemical, biological or nuclear weapons have been found."

       Shaking The Hand That Rocked My World  Let me start out by saying that this particular day started out in the crapper.  I had to wake up early (for me) to go check out a new house with my wife.  Those of you who know me know that Me + Morning = Argh.  We got to the house on time, to find the realitor (sp?)waiting for us.  When we got out of the car, he introduced himself to me, and completely ignored my wife.  He didn't even offer so much as a handshake to her, yet he was talking to me like I was a slot machine about to pay off big time.  Anyone who has ever been in a long term relationship with an American female knows that this is an error of the deadly sort.  Especially since she has just graduated from college (i go back in the fall) and will be paying a good chunk (read: most) of the bills.  He proceded to show us the house, which was quite nice, but the battle was lost from the initial charge.  We (he and I) shook hands and parted ways.  My wife proceded to verbally eviscerate him once we were safely in the car and away.  On top of this, I had to work that night on less that 4 hours of sleep, and in the process, was going to miss a chance to meet a man who plays a pivotal role in getting the music I like to the world stage.  I am of course speaking of Ian McKaye, singer, songwriter, and guitar player for the DC band  urlLink Fugazi , not to mention founder of the indie cornerstone  urlLink Dischord Records .  His work is very important to me personally, and I was sorely dissapointed by the fact that there was no way (short of quitting my job) that I was going to get to meet him, that night anyway.  I arrived at work on time, resigned to my fate, and got set up with a cash drawer for my shift.  (6PM-1AM) When I got out to the check-out counter, the normaly stoic Arianna O. seemed to be excited about something.  I asked her what was going on. "The Flaming Lips are in the store." "You're shitting me." "Nope, look over there." Sure enough, there was Wayne Coyne, singer, songwriter, and guitarist (among many many other things) of the  urlLink Flaming Lips , perusing our wide selection of cds and movies.  Well, I'd like to tell you all that I was totaly cool about him coming up to the counter and checking out.  Sadly, this was not the case.  I rang him out, and he commented on the fact that we give out a free magazine with every purchase.  I said something completely stupid like "Yeah, ain't free stuff cool?"  He bought a couple of CD's and a DVD of The Wizard Of Oz.  I had almost completed the transaction without making  too  big a fool of myself, when the guy with him (I think it was their drummer, my sincere apologies for not knowing you guys all on sight, Wayne has had more pictures taken of him.) commented on the Wesley Willis CD in our employeee picks section.  I took them both over and showed them the DVD that Willis just put out, and the other guy purchased it.  Arianna was helping him out when I made my move.   I walked up to Wayne and apologised for intruding on his personal time, and then introduced myself.  He introduced himself and said he was glad to meet me, and I told him that I was a huge fan of their work.  He thanked me for supporting them, and I asked why they were in town.  They are going to be doing a concert, but not for a couple of weeks yet.  Wayne said that their bus driver had some sort of sudden problem with a tooth, and they had stopped on their way to Portland to see if they could get him helped out.  I am pretty sure I wished them luck, but I was acting like such a star-struck moron that I am not sure I even did that.  Of course, I had absolutely none of their CD's in my car, having just pulled them out two days before to make a couple of mix discs for my trip to Japan this summer.  They left to go get some dinner, and I thanked them and said goodbye.  Later on that evening, I scraped together enough cash to buy the new 7 inch they put out with Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots on it.  I took it out to their tour bus, still parked in front of the store, and Wayne gladly signed it for me.  I would have been happy with a scribble, cause I know what it is like to be put out of your plans by sudden unexpected problems, but Wayne wrote a little personalized note on it, and drew smiley faces next to my name.  He even said to bring the disc back when they come to do the show, and he would have the rest of the band sign it.  My face hurts from grinning for the rest of the day. What can I even say.  Wayne & the Lips, thank you so much for pulling my day out of the doldrums at the last minute.  You guys rule.  What fantastic people.

       You Don't Get In Trouble When You Write The Law, Son   urlLink Lycos News | Republicans Limit Probe of Iraq Intelligence   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in Congress on Wednesday rebuffed calls by Democrats for a full-blown investigation into whether the Bush administration misread or inflated the threats posed by Iraq before going to war.  Of  course  they won't allow a gigantic Clinton-sized investigation into whether  they  did something wrong!  Telling the truth is suddenly becoming very unpatriotic.  I just wish we had a Democrat with enough balls to stand up to this bullshit.

      "We looked at the intelligence assessment process, and we've come to the conclusion that it is broken," author Joseph Cirincione said Thursday on CNN's "American Morning." "It is very likely that intelligence officials were pressured by senior administration officials to conform their threat assessments to pre-existing policies."    urlLink Full Story   The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has released a report "that found Iraq had ended its [WMD]programs by the mid-1990s and did not pose an immediate threat to the United States before the 2003 war."  There  are  sane people in this world after all.  How long before these people are branded as unpatriotic traitors?  Any bets?  Oh yeah, one note about a big story I missed on my "time off".  I just have to give a big 'ol thumbs up to Rush Limbaugh for being a total junkie.  I mean, I knew that he was a complete fuckhead to begin with, but holy shit dude, he pulled out all the stops on this one.  He even stays loyal to soul-crushing corporations in the process by having the good judgment to get hooked on an actual pharmaceutical (OxyContin/Hillbilly Heroin - Purdue Pharma of Norwalk, Connecticut) rather than a street drug.  Even in his misdeeds, he proves how devoted he is to furthering corporate interests.  Call it trickle-down dope-o-nomics.  Have fun dealing with the tough on crime sentencing policies courtesy of your buddy Richard Ashcroft.  Not that I actually believe he will ever be charged with anything, but hey, it's fun to dream.

      Every so often, I read a book that reminds me why I bother to pay attention to the world around me.  This time, those books are  Ishmael  and  My Ishmael .  The author Daniel Quinn utilizes a neat literary trick to achieve a view of the human race from the outside.  Rarely has a book made me sit up and pay attention like  Ishmael  did.  The second book is more of the same, so the impact is a little blunted by the prior experience, but it is no less valuable as a tool for cutting through so much of the bullshit that humanity surrounds itself with.  If you haven't read  Ishmael  yet, you need to.  Right now.    urlLink Link

      Dear Mr. Nader- I am writing in response to your decision to run as a candidate for the Presidency in 2004.  In your last presidential bid, I supported your campaign and voted for you because of several different reasons.  I looked around me and saw that our country was doing better financially than it had been in years.  I looked at the record of the man we had in office at the time, and my thought was that Clinton was an obvious improvement over Reagan and Bush, but things in this country could be so much better. I agreed with you that both political parties had too many debts to too many corporations, and that we would be better off with more than two political parties.  With things on the upswing for America, that was the perfect time to begin to try for a more perfect form of government.  I do not regret voting for you, and I believe Al Gore and his campaign managers are solely responsible for their own defeat.  This time, however, things are much different.  I cannot support a campaign that runs a risk of dividing support for any Democrat candidate that has a chance of defeating George W. Bush.  The risks are too great.  I believe that unless we get someone in office that can correct the mistakes of the current administration, and prevent the future disasters of a second term Bush presidency, the issues you fight for are going to become moot, because we will  too busy fighting for our lives and basic civil rights to worry about such niceties as campaign finance reform or multiple party political reform.  I still believe in you and thank you for your hard work over the decades Ralph, but I want your help in this fight, not another distraction.  Please reconsider, and realize that your country still needs your help, just in a different facility. Sincerely, Brian Thomas

Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world."...  "'Can Bush ignore the Pentagon? It's going be hard to blow off this sort of document. Its hugely embarrassing. After all, Bush's single highest priority is national defence. The Pentagon is no wacko, liberal group, generally speaking it is conservative. If climate change is a threat to national security and the economy, then he has to act. There are two groups the Bush Administration tend to listen to, the oil lobby and the Pentagon,' added Watson.  'You've got a President who says global warming is a hoax, and across the Potomac river you've got a Pentagon preparing for climate wars. It's pretty scary when Bush starts to ignore his own government on this issue,' said Rob Gueterbock of Greenpeace."

      "President George Bush's re-election campaign ran into trouble today after he was accused of delivering a 'slap in the face' to the victims of the September 11 attacks by using images of the atrocity in television adverts" "One of the 30-second commercials includes a brief clip of a body, wrapped in the American flag, being lifted from the wreckage of New York's World Trade Centre. Firefighters, who emerged as heroes of the rescue effort, also feature in the adverts." "Tom Roger, whose daughter was a flight attendant on American Airlines Flight 11, said: "I would be less offended if he showed a picture of himself in front of the Statue of Liberty. But to show the horror of 9/11 in the background, that's just some advertising agency's attempt to grab people by the throat," he told the New York Daily News."  This is what we get from a man who voluntarily uses the title "Wartime President" for himself.  Needless to say, using images of a tragedy to promote one's own political career is beneath contempt, and we were all pretty sure this was coming, but shit.  I still had hopes that some sort of human decency would prevail.  Now I know better.  This is gonna be one fucking ugly election.   urlLink Full Story

      Last night I went to my local Wal-mart, because I had some money burning a hole in my pocket.  I checked the book section in hopes that the new James Carville book would be out for sale.  Instead what I found was a veritable neocon library,  most notably a few books by Michael "Gays should get AIDS and die" Savage.  No books of a more liberal variety were to be found, I guess they didn't have room for them between all of the Chicken Soup for the Hobo's soul and Dr. Phil's most recent do-it-yourself self-loathing kit.  Both Sean Hannity's books were out, but Alan "spineless jellyfish" Colmes was apparently a little too controversial to go up in the same section as Oprah's bookhole.  Oh hey, lets not forget all 6000 volumes of the Pat Roberts rapture stroke fantasy Left Behind books.  So, until they at least carry Franken, Moore, and Carville's books, fuck Wal-Mart.  They know that there is almost no place else in the small towns they service to buy books, so they practice retail based  reprogramming.  Scum.  I'll be filling my useless crapola needs elsewhere for a while.

      You know, I was thinking today that we as a nation should come to grips with the fact that one or both of our political wings are extremely fucking misnamed.  Dictionary.com defines the word conserve(the base word of conservative) as: To protect from loss or harm; preserve.  In that case, I may be liberal (\Lib"er*al\, n. One who favors greater freedom in political or religious matters; an opponent of the established systems; a reformer;) but I can tell you, there are some things that I would like to conserve the shit out of.  My ass and my freedoms, for starters.  We liberals as a group have been so completely cornered, that it is no longer a matter of advancing our causes, but one of maintaining(conserving) the ground we have already won.  Perhaps the "conservatives" should re-label themselves the "voracious" (marked by boundless greed).  Food for thought. Definitions thanks to  urlLink Dictionary.com

       "The Bush administration last night condemned as "despicable" the killing of four American civilians working in Iraq, whose charred and mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets in front of a cheering crowd... Across Iraq it was one of the bloodiest days this year for the occupation. Five US soldiers also died in Habbaniya, 15 miles west of Falluja, when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. Near the southern city of Basra, three British soldiers were injured when they were caught in an explosion." Two Days Earlier... "Bush put on a slide show, calling it the "White House Election-Year Album" at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association 60th annual dinner, showing himself and his staff in some decidedly unflattering poses.  There was Bush looking under furniture in a fruitless, frustrating search. "Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere," he said. " I've said it before, and I'll say it again.

      "What is needed is a rediscovery of politics and a belief that purpose is best attempted in a secular guise underpinned by universal values, and that religion is a moral code to live by, rather than a purpose in its own right that gives believers the right to deny rationality and humanity."  Will Hutton of the Guardian UK makes the argument that the new fundamentalism in this country as well as others, is neither original, nor particularly new.  I've been saying these things for years.  Religion can be a great force in peoples lives, but not when it makes them think that they need to:  A: Evangelize everyone. B: Impose their rules, no matter how cracked, on the rest of the world. C: Ignore science and common sense because of some document written thousands of years ago and translated hundreds of times since. D: Ignore some basic tenets of their own faith and emphasize others in order to justify things like war, poverty, pollution, and preferential treatment of their own people over all others. E: Kill those that disagree with them.   Go read this sublimely intelligent article.  Great food for thought on this holiday.   urlLink Link

      President Bush was "moved" by recently published photos of caskets containing U.S. military personnel slain in Iraq but stands by his policy barring their publication, a White House spokesman said Friday.  "We must pay attention to the privacy of the families. That's what the policy is based on," White House spokesman Trent Duffy told reporters, describing that as "our first priority." If you believe a word of this bullshit, I've got a bridge to sell you.  SEVEN HUNDRED casualties into this war and  now  he's "moved"?  Maybe it's because he hasn't been to a single soldier's funeral in his entire presidency, even though he's somehow found the time to go to Camp David 78 times (I shit you not).  Or, maybe, it's because he's a FUCKING LIAR.  Think hard, folks.  What possible reason could he have for wanting to hide the bodies returning from Iraq?  The man who's presidency has overseen the sharpest decline in civil liberties in this country  ever , the man who brought you The Homeland Security Department, Camp X-Ray, The Patriot Act, The Department of Total Information Awareness, and Richard Ashcroft suddenly wants to protect someone's privacy?  Give me a fucking break.  That is perhaps the most insulting thing; that he thinks that we Americans are actually fucking stupid enough to swallow this load of shit.     urlLink Story

      Here's a bigger chunk of the quote from above: The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else. – Teddy Roosevelt in the Kansas City Star, May 7, 1918 Here's a couple more. I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.  – James Madison, June 16, 1788 Liberty has never come from the government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of government. The history of liberty is the history of resistance. The history of liberty is a history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it. – Woodrow Wilson Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first. – Ronald Reagan, March 2, 1977 (Obviously speaking about himself) The best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation. – James E. Carter There is nothing wrong in America that can't be fixed with what is right in America. – William Clinton The more I study it [the Constitution], the more I have come to admire it, realizing that no other document devised by the hand of man ever brought so much progress and happiness to humanity. – Calvin Coolidge, 1929 We Americans have no commission from God to police the world. – Benjamin Harrison The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion. – George Washington, Treaty of Tripoli, 1796 Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law. – Thomas Jefferson, February 10, 1814 War should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed. – William McKinley, March 4, 1897 Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear. – Harry S. Truman Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, in a final sense, [is] a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. – Dwight Eisenhower, April 16, 1953 Evil acts of the past are never rectified by evil acts of the present. – Lyndon B. Johnson, July 21, 1964  And, Dubya, I'll let you get the last word. If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier – so long as I'm the dictator. – George W.

      I dunno, but if you want a really old account of one, just ask the Bible:  1 Samuel 18:1-4 1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.  4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.   Even better, this guy Saul tries to kill David because he is jealous that people think David has killed thousands more Philistines than he has.  He misses with the javelin throws at him, and then becomes afraid of him.  Why?  Because God was  tight  with Dave's gay-marrying ass:  1 Samuel 18:6-14 6 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. 7 And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.  8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?  9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.  10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.  11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.  12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.  13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.  14 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.

       Bush has created what is in effect a gulag. It stretches from prisons in Afghanistan to Iraq, from Guantánamo to secret CIA prisons around the world. There are perhaps 10,000 people being held in Iraq, 1,000 in Afghanistan and almost 700 in Guantánamo, but no one knows the exact numbers. The law as it applies to them is whatever the executive deems necessary. There has been nothing like this system since the fall of the Soviet Union.    urlLink Full Story

      At this point, it's almost passe to make comparisons between current events and 1984 by George Orwell.  Which, if you've read the book, you know that really, really  really  sucks.  Last night on The Daily Show on Comedy Central Janeane Garofalo said something along the lines of 'at this point, a vote for [George W.] Bush is a character flaw'.  I couldn't agree more.  The worse the news gets coming out of Iraq, the less George Bush takes responsibility for it.  So we bumped Saddam out of Iraq and took over.  What does that really mean to anyone?  Apparently it means that those torture and rape chambers have to be run by  somebody , and it looks like that means us.  The atrocities get more disgusting and more immense with every day, and the Bush administration (or should I say the Ministry of Truth) somehow had nothing to do with any of it.  With the release of the pictures of the sexual assault on the Iraqi soldiers and now news that the American prison guards have killed 25 unarmed prisoners, some beaten to death with rocks, we have lost any hope of ever winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.  We should apologize and leave immediately.  Before this shit happened, there was at least some hope that we might be able to work together with the Iraqi people to build a new Iraqi government.  Now, that will never happen.  The only thing we can be sure of is continued and ever-escalating violence against our soldiers.  Who blames the Iraqis?  Not me.  Admit it.  If there were pictures and news stories about American soldiers being raped with flashlights and broomhandles, having electrodes attached to their penises, being paraded around naked and beaten to death, we would  lay waste  to the offending country.  No one would be safe from our wrath.  Even though it was proven that Saddam had no link with Al-Queda before we invaded, you can bet that Al-Queda operates in friendly country there now.  The  only  reasonable thing left to do at this point is to withdraw and hand everything over to the U.N.  If we do not, we will be trapped in a never-ending cycle of vengeance and violence.  Iraq will become an even bigger hellhole than Israel.  Our grand-children will die there.  Bottom line; we never had a reason to be there in the first place, and after this, staying there will be worse.  George W. Bush, you have destroyed the credibility of my country, killed my countrymen, and perpetrated the worst foreign policy failure this country has seen in almost 30 years.  Given time, and continued ineptitude on your part, it may become the worst failure ever.  Congratulations, asshole.    SOMEONE IMPEACH THIS FUCK!    Read George Orwell's 1984  urlLink here .

Rumsfeld refused to use the word "torture." "I'm not a lawyer," he said. "My impression is that what has been charged thus far is abuse, which I believe technically is different from torture ... And therefore I'm not going to address the 'torture' word."  Rumsfeld, you're not a lawyer, no.  You're a fuck.  There are some things even lawyers wouldn't do.

       Where Martin Luther King Drive meets Brown Street in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, things suddenly get dark. Not dark as in bleak, but dark as in skin. Heading north, past one of the city's three black newspapers and the country's only Black Holocaust museum, the only white faces you see for miles are the handful who stop to fill up their cars. And then, as quickly as they vanished, they will reappear as you approach deepest suburbia, a place called River Hills.  "It's like a foreign country to most whites," says Dennis Conta, 64, a public policy consultant and former state legislator, who is white, referring to the city's north side. "Most whites have never been in those neighbourhoods. They don't need to. With the freeways, they can just drive right past. You could spend three hours walking the streets before you saw any white people there, if you saw any at all."  Go read this excellent article about our country's racial present.   urlLink Full Story

      "The bishop of Colorado's second-largest Roman Catholic diocese issued a stark warning Friday, saying voters should not receive Communion if they back politicians who support abortion rights, stem-cell research, euthanasia and gay marriage." I was raised Catholic.  I grew up in a Roman Catholic Community, went to a Roman Catholic elementary school.  I was an altar boy, and I was married in the Roman Catholic Church.  I have never agreed with the church on many important points, such as the issues of priests marrying, female priests, their stance on homosexuality and homosexual marriage, the practice of reconciliation, but I was inspired by the ideals of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to stay within the church and try to change it from within.  Even through the altar boy sexual abuse scandal, I stuck with it, hoping that it could lead to a more open dialogue within the Catholic community about updating the practices of old to a more transparent, democratic future.  This, sadly, has failed to happen.  In my opinion, the Church has finally revealed itself for the moribund, worthlessly tradition-bound organization it is.  It has become a collection of pathetic prejudiced good old boys who value tradition more than truth.  So, barring future changes, I am no longer associating myself with the Roman Catholic Church.  So, you can have the decoder ring back, along with the tired homophobic rhetoric, bullshit black and white views on sexism and abortion, the hats, the pageantry and pomp; I won't be needing them any more.   urlLink Related Story

       The idea that these prisoners -- you know, they're not there for traffic violations. If they're in cell block 1A or 1B, these prisoners -- they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. Many of them probably have American blood on their hands. And here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals. - Oklahoma Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Fascist)  Never mind that the Red Cross and Amnesty International say that 80 to 90% of the prisoners were detained without reason.  Never mind that their treatment violates treaties that  we voluntarily signed .  Never mind that any person with any sense of conscience or morality would find these photos disgusting.  Inhofe, you fascist fuck, Nick Berg paid the price for your brand of leadership, and others will certainly follow.  Like I've said before, the country that would dare do that to our soldiers would be turned into a radioactive wasteland.  You sir, are an embarrassment to your country.  Do yourself a favor and resign now.  Save yourself the effort of running a loosing re-election campaign; even the most namby-pamby of Democrats will be able to bury your sorry ass after this, and good riddance to bad rubbish.

      Ok, I'm sure someone thought this up before me, but who cares. Rules:  The game is in effect whenever Bush is either on TV or is being quoted on TV.  Below are the phrases to look for and their drink/equivalent.  1.  "Stay The Course" - 1 Drink 2.  "Freedom" - 1 Drink 3.  "Evil-Doer" - 1 Drink 4.  Lies about anything - 1 Drink 5.  Mispronounces minor words like "Misunderestimated" - 1 Drink 6.  Mispronounces proper nouns like names, places, etc... - 2 Drinks 7.  Refers to himself as a "Wartime President" - 2 Drinks 8.  Calls Rumsfeld the "Best Secretary Of Defense Ever" - 2 Drinks, Cry into your beer. 9.  Links 9/11 & Saddam- Roll a fattie and shotgun hits to your dog     (who is still smarter that Bush, even high). 10. Admits His Mistakes - Shout in amazement, Snort cocaine off      of hooker's ass. 11. Announces Draft - Shoot heroin into upper thigh, next to nutsac      to avoid detection. Flee to Canada. 12. Says something you agree with - Pop another OxyContin and go back to being trashing minorities on your radio   show.

       "All right, so we're at war with these people. And they're in a prison where they're being softened up for interrogation. And we hear that the most humiliating thing you can do is make one Arab male disrobe in front of another. Sounds to me like it's pretty thoughtful. Sounds to me in the context of war this is pretty good intimidation -- and especially if you put a woman in front of them and then spread those pictures around the Arab world. And we're sitting here, 'Oh my God, they're gonna hate us! Oh no! What are they gonna think of us?' I think maybe the other perspective needs to be at least considered. Maybe they're gonna think we are serious. Maybe they're gonna think we mean it this time. Maybe they're gonna think we're not gonna kowtow to them. Maybe the people who ordered this are pretty smart. Maybe the people who executed this pulled off a brilliant maneuver."  The White house, of course, refused to repudiate this shithead's attack on basic human dignity.  This man is obviously back on the Hillbilly Heroin.  What other explanation is there for this?  I am disgusted beyond words that anyone would think this, let alone say it on a nationally syndicated radio show.  Human life has no value at all to this sack of shit.

      Here's what the douche said:  "I think there should be no mercy shown to these sub-humans. I believe that a thousand of them should be killed tomorrow. I think a thousand of them held in the Iraqi prison should be given 24 hour[s] -- a trial and executed. I think they need to be shown that we are not going to roll over to them ... Instead of putting joysticks, I would have liked to have seen dynamite put in their orifices and they should be dropped from airplanes ... They should put dynamite in their behinds and drop them from 35,000 feet, the whole pack of scum out of that jail."  The next day Savage added that Arabs were "racist, fascist bigots," and purported to speak for a majority of Americans regarding the war. He offered several all-American solutions to our problems in the Middle East.  "Right now, even people sitting on the fence would like George Bush to drop a nuclear weapon on an Arab country. They don't even care which one it would be. I can guarantee you -- I don't need to go to Mr. Schmuck [pollster John] Zogby and ask him his opinion ... The most -- I tell you right now -- the largest percentage of Americans would like to see a nuclear weapon dropped on a major Arab capital. They don't even care which one...  "I think these people need to be forcibly converted to Christianity ... It's the only thing that can probably turn them into human beings."  So, you call it.  Wack job or shithead?  Or both?  Probably both.  Savage, you get to hang out with Inhofe and Limbaugh in the "I like to prove the terrorists are right about us" lounge.  Congrats, fuckwad.

      Anybody out there heard of the concept of the constant dollar?  ADVFN Financial Glossary defines constant dollars as: "Dollars as if in some base year, used to adjust for the effects of inflation."  Basically, constant dollars can show you a comparison of the purchasing power of x amount of dollars at some time in the past compared with the same amount of dollars today.  Example: in 1997, the federal minimum wage was raised from $4.75 to $5.15.  It has not been changed in the seven years since, so if your constant (base year) is set at the purchasing power of 1996 dollars (as it was in the handy-dandy chart I used for this post), $5.15's purchasing power is actually less now(about $4.40) than $4.75's in 1996, the year it was put into effect.  In fact, the latest increase lost eleven cents in value in its first year alone, and was lower in value in 1996 dollars than the 1996 increase by the year 2000.  The Federal Minimum Wage is at its lowest value in constant dollars in almost 50 years.  But dood, I make more than minimum wage, you say?  If you don't get a yearly pay increase of at least as much as inflation has increased, you are being given a pay reduction.  Wages in constant dollars have fallen to 60's era levels.  That means that on average, the American people haven't had a lasting pay raise since the sixties.  Some economists theorize that my generation will be the first to fail to attain a higher standard of living than it's predecessor since the industrial revolution.  Simple economics, bud.  This is why Bush & his rich white corporate buddies don't want you to pay attention to details, especially now that inflation is becoming a problem.  They don't want you to feel it when they bend you over and fuck you with a flashlight.  This is why nobody has a stay at home mom anymore.  This is why nobody can get by on what they pay you at Mc Donalds.  Below is an excerpt detailing the results of decomposing wage levels in America.  Of course, the poverty of the soldiers involved in prison torture makes them neither more guilty, nor less. But the more we learn about them, the clearer it becomes that the lack of good jobs and social equality in the US is precisely what brought them to Iraq in the first place. Despite his attempts to use the economy to distract attention from Iraq, and his efforts to isolate the soldiers as un-American deviants, these are the children George Bush left behind, fleeing dead-end McJobs, abusive prisons, unaffordable education and closed factories.  And they are his children in another way too: it's in the ubiquitous thumbs-up sign that they flash, seemingly oblivious to the disaster at their feet. This is the quintessential George Bush pose. Convinced that US voters want a positive president, the Bush team has learned to use optimism as an offensive weapon: no matter how devastating the crisis, no matter how many lives have been destroyed, they have insistently given the world the thumbs up.  Donald Rumsfeld? "Doing a superb job," according to the optimist-in-chief. The mission in Iraq? "We're making progress, you bet," Bush told reporters one year after his disastrous "mission accomplished" speech. And the US job market, which has driven so many into poverty? "Yes, America can!"

      Jeez, it's been a while since I've been here.  What can I say, I've once again moved cross-country, and had a daughter.  I've been busy. Issue 1:  The Assault Weapons Ban.  It ends automatically this summer, and you know the prostitutes in the White House aren't about to push for it's renewal.  Go sign the petition over at  urlLink Tom Mauser 's website.  Tom is the father of one of the children killed by assault weapons at Columbine. Issue 2: Fahrenheit 9/11.  Get out and see it.  The truth is stranger (and sadder) than fiction. Issue 3: The October Surprise / The November Ass-Raping.    "U.S. counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the presidential election in case of such an attack."  Q: Is there any depth the Bush Administration Pig Fuckers won't stoop to to stay in power? A: Nope, there's not.  I'd start looking into taking a month long or so vacation in October if I lived in D.C. or NYC.  Just ask Bush, he'll have some ideas how you can balance important things in you life against your need to stand idly by and do nothing.  Perhaps there's some brush that needs clearing at his ranch.  Vote (if you're allowed) Kerry/Edwards, and Bush can clear all the brush he wants.  Apparently having the voting machines manufactured by a huge Bush campaign supporter wasn't obvious enough.
