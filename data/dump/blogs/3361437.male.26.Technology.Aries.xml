      Then Almitra spoke again and said, And what of marriage, master?  And he answered saying: You were born together, and together you shall be for evermore. You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days. Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of god. But let there be spaces in your togetherness.  And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.   Love one another, but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving see between the shores of your souls.  Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another your bread but eat not of the same loaf.  Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,  Even as the stings of a lute are alone they quiver with the same music.   Give your hearts, but not into each others keeping. For only the hand of life can contain your hearts.  And stand together yet not too near together:  for the pillars of a temple stand apart,  And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow    this passage was read at our wedding reception by our wonderful M.C

Ender's Game, a cult classic by Orson Scott Card, tells the story of a group of young soldiers battling aliens in a video game. In the end, they emerge to find that their victory has saved humankind, and that it was not a game.     "Ender's Game has had a lot of influence on our thinking," said Michael Macedonia, director of the Army's simulation technology center in Orlando, Fla., which plans to build a virtual Afghanistan that could host hundreds of thousands of networked computers. "The intent is to build a simulation that allows people to play in that world for months or years, participate in different types of roles and see consequences of their decisions."

      I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL...this made me think of you....   urlLink Winds of Change.NET: Absence: A Poem : "Absence: A Poem by Amy Lowell (1874 - 1925) My cup is empty to-night, Cold and dry are its sides, Chilled by the wind from the open window. Empty and void, it sparkles white in the moonlight. The room is filled with the strange scent Of wistaria blossoms. They sway in the moon's radiance And tap against the wall. But the cup of my heart is still, And cold, and empty. When you come, it brims Red and trembling with blood, Heart's blood for your drinking; To fill your mouth with love And the bitter-sweet taste of a soul."

                  I Cannot take the credit for  this, posted by Mat on:   The Wayward WebLog &nbsp;this could  have been written by me...if you know what i mean.        Programming in the Brain          I&#8217;m staring at source code again. &nbsp;   This time it&#8217;s not mine. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m  not looking for a flaw. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m not  trying to fix something. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m just  trying to understand; hundreds of files, thousands of functions, millions of  lines. &nbsp;  I stare at them and I read  them, not line by line. &nbsp;  I skip over  those and glance at declarations. &nbsp;  I  see words stitched together into names with parameters and types. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m not sure what they mean yet,  unfamiliar with the pattern. &nbsp;  I  don&#8217;t really know what the code inside does, but that&#8217;s just details. &nbsp;  I see the names to know who they are,  where they are. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m building a  roadmap in my brain.       &nbsp;      Soon the code takes shape to me. &nbsp;   It might have been hours or days, but eventually it is there. &nbsp;  I can now feel the code, a sensory  perception on the periphery of what is real. &nbsp;  I know how the code is defined, what its  facets look like, where they are placed. &nbsp;   I scroll through the files once more, seeing them again, like photographs  of old friends. &nbsp;  I look into each  and see references to others. &nbsp;  Look,  there&#8217;s that same little guy. &nbsp;  He&#8217;s  over here too. &nbsp;  I don&#8217;t know why,  but now I see how. &nbsp;  The code becomes  three dimensional, linked together in a graph, woven together like a tapestry;  function upon function, hierarchical and ordered.      &nbsp;        It&#8217;s only now that I begin to understand what it is that  the code actually does, a portrait forming in my mind, full and complete. &nbsp;  I had some idea going in, but that was a  base perception, a rough image painted with broad strokes.  &nbsp; Now I see the details, the intricacy, the  patterns and the truth. &nbsp;  I walk  through the code and feel it react. &nbsp;   I know where it is going and I know where it&#8217;s been. &nbsp;  I don&#8217;t need a machine to tell me  this. &nbsp;   &nbsp; It happens all inside my head as I sit in  the car driving to and from work, as I shower in the morning, as I lay awake at  night. &nbsp;            &nbsp;     But that's just  me.         &nbsp;     Matt       posted on Thursday,  May 20, 2004 10:09 AM

                      Old Brains  Can Learn New Tricks       A study led by the Rotman Research  Institute at Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto has found that older  adults can perform just as well as young adults on visual, short-term memory  tests. What's remarkable, however, is that older adults use different areas of  the brain than younger people.      The study, in conjunction with the  University of Toronto and Brandeis University in Massachusetts, is to be  published in the Oct. 25th international journal Current Biology. While other  studies have conducted comparisons of young and old brain activity, this is the  first to focus on how the interplay of brain regions relates to cognitive  functioning and aging.      "The older brain is more resilient than  we think," says Dr. Randy McIntosh, Rotman scientist and assistant professor,  Department of Psychology, at University of Toronto. "If aging brains can find  ways to compensate for cognitive decline, this could have exciting implications  for memory rehabilitation."      Ten young adults (ages 20 to 30) and  nine older adults (ages 60 to 79) participated in identical visual, short-term  memory tests while their brain activity was measured using positron emission  tomography (PET). PET measures regional cerebral blood and acts as a marker to  show which brain areas are lighting up during a memory performance task.       Participants were shown pairs of  vertical grid patterns on a computer screen and asked to select which one had  the higher spatial frequency. After viewing each pair, they would press one of  two keys to indicate the correct grid. Researchers measured their ability to  discriminate stimuli over half-second and four-second intervals.      Results show that young and older  participants perform the memory task equally well, but the neural systems or  pathways supporting performance differed between young and older individuals.  While there was some overlap in the brain regions supporting performance (e.g.  occipital, temporal and inferior prefrontal cortices), the neural communication  among these common regions was much weaker in older individuals.      Older individuals compensated for this  weakness by recruiting unique areas of the brain, including hippocampus and  dorsal prefrontal cortices. Scientists are most fascinated by the older brain's  activation of the hippocampus because this area is generally used for more  complicated memory tasks such as learning lines from a Shakespeare play.       Dr. McIntosh was assisted in the study  by Dr. Allison Sekuler, Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, and her  father Dr. Robert Sekuler at Brandeis University.      Funding for the study was provided by  the Alzheimer's Association of America, the Natural Sciences and Engineering  Research Council of Canada, and Medical Research Council of Canada.

                     AFTER A FEW BRIEF CHATS AND 2 LOOOONG NITES,&nbsp;I have decide that a  little Discussion Mike and I were having on Consciousness is worth further  investigating...maybe we have it licked - maybe AI is  easy!?.....       Read on for our continued  discussion on Correlational Opponent Theory.             &gt;&gt; Damn you and your damn  theory!       *teehee*...this is a topic that  my brain has been chewing on for about 10 years....glad to see it is causing  someone ELSE to "lose some sleep"       &gt;&gt;Ever since you told me you  believe that each person simply "reacts" to his/her surroundings, I've been  watching people, and thinking hard for some evidence it's not true. And so far,  I haven't found it - But - I still haven't found any evidence to disprove my  preferable theory that we are unique, blah blah....       AHH Yes, and that is the beauty  of this "Little" theory - I have not been able to debunk it so far..however nor  have I really been able to PROVE it "beyond a shadow"...thats what the whole  Co-OpTheory Worksheet is for - trying to formalize the idea and get any wrinkles  in the logic ironed out with some factual (albeit mathematical)  data.       &gt;&gt;Unique in appearance -  there is no question there. Unique in mind, well - yes - I believe that (tho I'm  still considering the development of the mind [in relation to experiences] as  people grow from being a little toddler) - unique in behaviour - well, I would  say yes also, if I didn't see so many people behaving in extremely predictable  ways every day. I could argue that one's determination to think for themselves  creates individuality and uniqueness....But the rebuttal to that would be that  throughout the course of that person's life, they have been exposed to  situations, or attitudes that have given them the attitude towards  thinking.       Well, this is a much more  complex thought process than initially it seems....MY Argument is that human  behaviour is a systematic respose to the current input stimuli that the Human  receives COMBINED with ALL of the responses to ALL PREVIOUS inputs to the  system....In this way, the "Learned", "Programmed" or "Aquired" behavioural  mechanisms that humans develop are essentially the "Least amount of change  required" to make their output (actions/Behaviours) EQUALLY OPPOSE the combined  inputs (and learned adjustments to those inputs from the past)..our basic  motivation then becomes Laziness.."What is the least amount of work  (output/action I have to take) I have to do in order to balance this  equation:       Current Inputs + Behaviour =  Sum of all Inputs and outputs provided to the system over  time       _IF_ perchance, my past actions  created an internal "Engram" that means NEXT time the same scenario comes around  I don't see it as being "out of the ordinary" or interesting (i.e If the value  of my brainwaves PLUS the input scenario is CLOSE to what I remember) then the  input can be considered fully learned...How then, can we "LEARN" behaviour's in  such a way that we exhibit "Unique" personal behaviours? Easy...when we  encounter the input stimuli, something ELSE (other than the INPUT and our  OUTPUT) "unbalances" the system...for instance, if a parent ADD's input the a  baby's "Processor" during and after the presentation of an input then the INPUT  will NOT equal the memory encoded in the baby's brain and therefore the scenario  becomes "Interesting" to the baby and the baby's mind encodes the difference  between the input and the expected value back into the system so that next time  the memory is closer to the inputs...       Which leads to your next  comment really well:       &gt;&gt;Raising a child will  provide some decent evidence one way or another towards this topic - how they  learn, what they learn for themselves and why - for example - I have a cousin  who is a couple of years old - he can open and close sliding glass doors, and  understands that getting his fingers jammed would be bad - yet he has never  jammed his fingers..... (I don't know if this is something his parents tried to  teach him...)       YES..Spot on!...{maybe Kat and  I should get onto the baby-making-bandwagon and "Build" ourselves our very own  Human-AI experiment *LOL*}...i am actually looking forwad to Fatherhood partly  for this (not exact) reason..i think I understand the complexity of the layering  of learned experience enough to be a "Useful" father...also though, because the  system is LOGARITHMICALLY complex (i.e. a previous learned response cannot be  undone, it must be "learned out" and the "Whole of Brain" experiece is fully  encoded - Every input and response EVER EXPERIENCED is incoded in the brain  engram all at the same time)..i am aware that it is a pretty oenerous task and  MY Mistakes compound once they are learned by my child......       The Sliding door  conundrum.....not so hard to explain....TWO bits to it:       Going back to ..."Least amount  of change required" to make their output (actions/Behaviours) EQUALLY OPPOSE the  combined inputs"... If the inputs to this "feedback loop" include metrics such  as current amount of pain, current amount of force being exerted as WELL as  visual cues such as the location of the child's hand in relation to other  objects, velocity of the door etc... then this whole "least amount of  resistance" theory covers this learned behaviour by trying to balance the  _potential_ for pain (or bad experience) with the current siutation...However,  The child must have been made aware of their own mortality for this all to work.  At some point the input to the system (Pain, blood, shouting at by mum and dad)  increased above the "remembered" value and caused a learning experience....this  learning experience then gets "reused" in different scenarios..HOW?...well you  see this whole process exhibits a sort of INERTIA....like this: Child puts hand  near something (other than a door) MUM or DAD yells at them to stop (protecting  them from hurting themselves) and the Input stuation now does not match what the  child expects (an INTERESTING situation occurs) so the child learns to expect  shouting when their hand nears something...next time mum and dad DON't yell  (situation is not dangerous)..this in turn Becomes an INTERESTING situation  because the child was expecting to be shouted at when their hand goes near  something but weren't (and, as such their inputs don't match their  memory)....they Un-Learn the hand/shout scenario a little bit...this naturally  encodes the "Middle ground" between the two scenarios and, unknowingly, has  encoded the same situation with varying inputs as a Safe/Not Safe engram....As  soon as the child goes to touch something and doesn't get shouted at, they LEARN  the situation to be safe (because there was no shouting and the inputs _still_  do not exactly match the memory). In this way, although MUM &amp; DAD did not  "Teach" the "Doors can hurt your hand" Meme to the child, they have learned the  process for evaulating safe stuations because they were told about an unsafe one  (I think that all makes sense)....THIS DOES NOT WORK IF THE CHILD HAS NOT FELT  PAIN! - if the child has not felt pain then there is no difference between the  inputs of:        * the child's hand touching a  HOT item that could hurt them (or sharp-hurty door)       * the child's hand touching a  soft cushion that could not       If there is no difference in  these two inputs from the child's point of view then there could be no  learning...thus we can prove that in order for this theory to work, a feedback  allowing data about the Host/Human/Child/Robot needs to be included as an input  to the system...which is ok because this is exactly what humans have - 5 RAW  sensory inputs (Smell, touch, taste, sight sound) plus multiple internal inputs  (heart rate, temperature, pain, emotive response, hunger  etc).       Secondly (an briefly coz this  is oficcially a long-winded email now), various regions of the brain are used  for differnet tasks and trained specifically for those tasks accordingly..the  various different areas of the brain are then "Joined" together (at the Mendula  Oblongata) and the total output is sent down the spinal cord to complete the  feedback loop (action is taken, the response from the action is the next input  value..e.g turn your head, the visual [and audio] input changes, potentially  producing an output). Over time, (and continuously over our life), sections of  the brain become increasingly and slowly diconnected from each other.... At a  time near conception, our brains are almost "fully connectionist" that is; each  neuron is (almost) connected to every other neuron in the brain, therefore the  brain is completely aware of the other bits of the brain....as time goes by  (rapidly when young, slowly as we get older) connections between nerons are  "dropped" this results in sections of the brain becoming diconnected from other  sections at least partially. The effect of this is that sections of the brain  that are "Trained" to respond to certain inputs no longer have the "Complete"  view of the world that they used to and are required to provide an output based  upon on the "partial picture" of the world that it has....when many sections  make "Guesses" like this, it results in novel reponses that still are applicable  to the scenario they are in response to but based upon incomplete or inaccurate  data and, therefore NOT QUITE RIGHT" which we see as being "Creative" or "Novel"  thought....this is kinda like the "Tower Of Babel" story of how "God" introduced  the Languagfe Barrier (Different languages did not exist in th ebible before  this time) overnight in order to stop humans building a tower all the way to  heaven...the brain, after some initial training in the "one big same  language"...suddenly starts speaking different dialects in different areas and  cant fully understand the dialect of other areas...this results in a kinda  neural "chinese whispers" which we see as Creativity or uniqueness - hrmm maybe  this is a good name for creative thought (Neural Chinese  whispers)...       (Also links between neurons  that have no direct link to the outside world are created over time in the brain  ...that is, one part of the brain may take its input from the output of another  part of the brain...so these decision making links are heirarchical not  flat!)       Soooo, from 3 simple theorys  (Co-Op theory + Neural Learning + Disconnectionist evolution) we get  intelligence and creative thought....       The next question is, how does  this apply to evolution?        Could, over time, our  physiology change so that certain areas of the brain are pre-connected (or  pre-disconnected) from each other to produce a more efficent brain? - is this  what happened between Homo Sapiens (neanderthal man) and Homo Sapien-Sapiens  (Human man)??       Could, over time, the "Driver  Signal" used to start this "wave theory thing I have going" (in this case the  28Hz driver signal on the Excel worksheet) be customized to pre-contain data on  it rather than being a blank driver signal...could, perhaps, we be copied with  the waveform (or part of) that our parent/mother has and, therefore, could we be  born with A Priori knowledge of the world?...the answer would seem at first look  to be YES - after all, we are exactly the same biological species as our  ancestors but we are "Smarter" or seem to be because we "Know more about  more"..we "remember" what our ancestors learned to some degree...now, sure, some  of this is because we have ancestors alive to change our inputs and therfore  condition our responses as well as other artifacts such as the technology  available today as opposed to before which change our inputs compared to those  of our ancestors and, thus change our behaviours BUT, how can WE (our  generation) learn everything our previous generations knew and then use that  knowledge to "Create" ne knowledge and then continue the cycle?...surely this is  only possible if, every generation, we Pre-Prime the driver waveform of the  brain with some knowledge (that is, it is not a simple Sine wave but a complex  wavelett similar to that left over after a waveform has already "Learned"  something)???         &nbsp;     Ahhh..well I would say you have  just touched the tip of a 10-years-worth-of-thought iceburg...maybe I should  finish this email here and continue my rant at another  time....       ;)       Hey, By the way, what time u  knocking of today?...chances of a lift?       Lastly, I am enjoying  discussing this with someone (for once) so much I have created an online blog  for it..you will get an invite email soon, we can continue this thread on there  (and, thus refer our notes or any links we get) from home.       The Blog will be  at:         http://bitkraft.blogspot.com/         My IT Blog is at           http://tiggrbitz.blogspot.com         Kat and I have a personal one  at         http://tiggrlyfe.blogspot.com       tho it is blank at the  mo       Cheers.

   Parallel Polarity   
   Though this is not actually my work, i think this is great.&nbsp; Thanx to      Matt at The Wayward Weblog      for this gem..   
 
  Sometimes scientific discoveries are not made in the lab, sometimes they are born out of conjecture and backed up by observation alone.&nbsp; Thank goodness for that or I'd have never discovered the truth.&nbsp; I suppose many of you have thoughts on occasion that traverse the wide open possibilities of our reality, pondering classical conundrums and esoterica that on the surface seem like silly notions, so seldom do you venture much deeper.&nbsp; I, on the other hand, take great pride in plummeting head first into abstract thought and taking even somewhat clever notions beyond into the realm of abject absurdity.  
  You might think I do this with the noble intention of seeking out a laugh, something to tickle the funny bone of my family and friends or to evoke a short chuckle from me alone as I sit in a meeting ignoring everything else but my own little amusements.&nbsp; But this is not the case.&nbsp; I do have a more serious destination&nbsp;and&nbsp;I am most diligent in its pursuit.&nbsp; Certainly, I cannot escape the&nbsp;onset of&nbsp;laughter as I do uncover the ridiculous and&nbsp;bizarre.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;to be expected.&nbsp; It&nbsp;comes with the territory, and I don't mind it one bit; it soothes the soul and is the medicine for what ails you.&nbsp; Yet, however delightful that feeling of&nbsp;levity may be, it is nothing compared the utter&nbsp;joy felt when&nbsp;I finally stumble upon a revelation that is destined to rock the foundation of understanding that&nbsp;I and everyone else on this great green ball cling to daily.  
  That's why I spared no time in rushing to my PC this morning in order to craft this post, because I knew I finally had something of note that when shared with rest of humanity might just change the way we look at ourselves, the world around us and in truth the fabric of reality that underpins our very existence.&nbsp; So without further ado, I'll just blurt it out and then get on with the explanation and supporting evidence.&nbsp;   
  It has come to my attention, through observation, deep analysis and profound insight, that travel between parallel dimensions is not only possible, it is happening all the time.&nbsp; Now, before you commit me to the loony bin, hear me out so you will feel confident that you had all the facts, all the arguments and proofs.&nbsp;   
  Certainly, this might seem a big deal.&nbsp; Am I talking about Slider-esque travel through a vortex into a parallel dimension, where people look like us but are up to no good?&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; I'm not talking big science-fiction Hollywood style travel, or even highly speculative jaunts through a black hole (especially since Stephen dashed my hopes on that one.)&nbsp; I'm talking about everyday, normal slips between realities that we experience even though we don't know that it is happening.  
  You see, as it turns out, the walls between parallel realities are not so thick at all.&nbsp; They're not even walls really, just sort of a conceptual boundary.&nbsp; The closer any two realities are to one another, the more they sort of touch, overlapping one another if you will.&nbsp; So another universe&nbsp;where I diverge from myself quite considerably, or apes rule the planet would actually be so&nbsp;drastically different there would unlikely be slips large enough to send anyone from here to there.&nbsp; However, realities that diverge only slightly, so subtly that they are almost identical except to the trained and diligent mind, they are in fact so close that they overlap entirely.&nbsp; Between these we travel constantly, slipping in and out of each without a second thought.  
  The real trick to recognizing that these traversals do indeed occur is to observe it in action.&nbsp; Take any monumental event that you and others may have experienced in the recent past.&nbsp; Ask each person involved to write down exactly what happened.&nbsp; Compare.&nbsp; You'll find a quite a deviation between observers.&nbsp; Is this because each is so inept as to be unable to recognize what you have obviously recalled as the truth?&nbsp; Or could it be that each has remembered the event quite accurately, yet their experiences diverge due to differences in reality at the time of observation?  
  This is not just hypothetical.&nbsp; It happens to me all the time.&nbsp;  
  Have you ever looked at&nbsp;a written word and thought, “that doesn't look right?”&nbsp; Well, it doesn't because you've shifted realities.&nbsp;   
  Have you ever&nbsp;started thinking something that you&nbsp;later find out your spouse, sibling or friend was also thinking?&nbsp; Without ever talking?&nbsp; Well, you did in a different reality.  
  This is why you always feel out of sorts.&nbsp; The rules keep changing.&nbsp; You're never really in the same place again.&nbsp; You keep slipping.  
  Have you ever looked at the keyboard and wondered what happened to the Quelm?&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; It was sort of a squarish letter.&nbsp; And this one, 'Z', I can't quite recall ever&nbsp;using seeing that one before.

The Humanoid Project  
  The Humanoid Project is a project being undertaken at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. The long term aim is to build a life-sized humanoid robot which is capable of walking, navigating around obstacles, and operating completely autonomously whilst being controlled verbally. To date a 60cm tall prototype robot named Elvis has been built (see below).     The behaviours of the robot, such as walking, are entirely developed using evolutionary software. This software employs genetic algorithms to enable the robot to teach itself to maintain balance and walk. Thus adaptability is placed before precision.   
   Elvis, The Prototype:   The prototype robot is bipedal and has human-like geometry &amp; motion. It has legs, arms and hands all controlled by 42 servos. Senses are provided by microphones, cameras, touch sensors.   
  Evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming are used in three hierarchical layers used for control:   
  Reactive layer - for reactive behaviours such as balancing.  Model building layer - for memories of past events, evolving models and basic control tasks.  Reasoning layer - for symbolic processing, higher brain functions such as navigation and safety.  Behaviours and Control:  Balancing - achieved through touch sensors on the feet to find the centre of gravity and two electronic gyros mounted in the head to minimize head movements. The robot is initially suspended in a safety harness with a sensor to detect total loss of balance. Evolutionary algorithms in the reactive and model building layers enable the robot to learn to walk and balance.  Vision - the robot has two CCD cameras for stereo vision. A program is evolved to build a 3D model of the environment. Another program is then evolved which uses this 3D map to build generalised representations of 3D objects such as boxes and cones.  Navigation - the third symbolic reasoning layer is used to integrate vision and walking to follow walls and avoid obstacles.  Audio orientation - 2 microphones are used for stereophonic hearing. A Genetic Programming system evolves a program to determine the direction sound and to focus the robots attention. Future work will be on separation of sound sources and recognition of commands.  Manipulation - each hand has 2 fingers and a thumb. Each is equipped with touch sensors capable of sensing forces from 10g to tens of Kg's.   
   Future Plans:   The prototype robot is not yet fully autonomous. It is currently controlled by a remote NT Workstation and power supply. The plan is to make it fully autonomous by including an onboard power supply and main processing unit - perhaps a handheld PC. Total weight should be less than 5Kg. The long term aim is a human sized humanoid weighing 60Kg.

   Computing with Leech Neurons    
  Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA have extracted living neurons from leeches and connected them, through micro-electrodes, to a computer. By stimulating the neurons in a specific way and recording their responses it was possible to get the neurons to perform rudimentary calculations such as adding two numbers.     The experimental set-up (pictured below) consisted of just a handful of neurons placed in a petri dish. Leech neurons were used because they have been extensively studied in the past and their behaviours are well understood. The neurons were not manually connected together. Rather, they were encouraged to grow and form synapses of their own accord.    This research is still in its very early stages. Professor William Ditto, the leader of the team at Georgia Tech, says that he hopes to go on to build much larger versions of these biological computers. Eventually such cultured neurons could be integrated with artificial eyes and ears to give a complete robot brain. The advantages of such biological computers would be their increased flexibility. They are not restricted by the rigid programming rules of today's computers. Instead they could work things out for themselves.   
   Neurobiology of Leeches:   The leech is an annelid, the biological grouping which includes earthworms. The Latin name for the well known blood sucking leech is Hirundinea Medicinalis. It is this species which is applied to wounds so as to remove possible infection.   
  The leech is comprised of 1 head segment and 21 body segments. The head segment contains the brain (in 2 parts, dorsal and ventral). Each of the body segments has a ganglion of about 400 neurons. These ganglion are not much smaller than the brain. Thus the total number of neurons per leech is 15,000 to 20,000.   
  One reason that the leech nervous system has been so well studied is that its neurons are relatively large (60µm). The morphology of the neurons is also remarkably uniform between ganglia and animals. The neurons in the head, being smaller, are less well understood.   
  It is remarkable that despite its relative paucity of neurons the leech is capable of such an array of movements and behaviours (body waving, crawling, swimming, shortening, foraging for food, feeding, and mating).   
   Leech Neuroscience at Emory University:   This research into computing with leech neurons is being conducted in collaboration with scientists at Emory university, also in Atlanta, Georgia. The focus of their research is the neural circuit which controls the leech heart. Oscillatory neurons in the 3rd and 4th ganglion are found to be coupled with the heart interneurons of the 1st and 2nd ganglion. Together these cells form the timing network which controls the rhythmic motor cells of the heart.

    Darwinian Poetry     
   The goal of this project is to see if non-negotiated collaboration can evolve interesting poetry using (un)natural selection.   
  Huh?  
  Ok, here's the idea: starting with a whole bunch (specifically 1,000) randomly generated groups of words (our "poems"), we are going to subject them to a form of natural selection, killing off the "bad" ones and breeding the "good" ones with each other. If enough generations go by, and if the gene pool is rich enough, we should eventually start to see interesting poems emerge.  
  The cool part is that YOU are the arbiter of what constitutes "good" and "bad" poetry......

         I really shouldn't cross-post like this but i MUST point you to an excellent discussion topic....check out this:   
    A Question of Ethics    
  In an older post, I reflected briefly on the idea that artificial life could be given different basic motivations than biological life. Biological life essentially does whatever it can to survive and multiply. Human society is shaped by this same motivation. One could assume that any 'machine society' formed of sentient machines would be shaped by their most basic motivations.  
  Since we're the ones creating them, it seems that we could choose what those basic motivations are.  
  Let's imagine a scenario. What if sentient machines were created, with the 'hardwired' core motivation of 'making humans happy'. That is, the most basic feeling of satisfaction these machines would feel would come from making humans happy. This would be as strong a motivation in them as we are used to seeing reproduction be in other forms of life."...

  #{TIGGR} - Again NOT my work but a great topic..i kinda am a bit obsessed with this topic at the moment - taking up lots of my spare intellectual bandwidth!...  
   Present Living, part deux   
    
   
   Present Living [part un]   , Luke's "   Past, Present, and Future    (response).  
    
   
  Luke's post makes me want to speculate as to what the difference could be between two people (besides claims to being screwed up) that leads them to have [on the surface] similar present-thinking philosophies, but for one to need (?) a belief in other-worldly permanence and the other not to:  
    
   
  I do believe there are permanent things in the world, but I can not empirically prove it's existence. I believe that the Creator has existed for all time and will continue to exist long after this world has been erased from the drawing board. I have faith that when I die my soul (spirit) will continue to live on as a unique individual like I am now and that I will spend the rest of eternity in bliss.   
  
  Perhaps it is my belief in the spiritual that frees me from the need of permanence in this world...then again I could just be screwed up in the head. You decide.   
    
   
  My first thought when I read this was a laughing, "Hey, that's  cheating !"  
    
   
  But it does raise an interesting point that I didn't address in Part un--spirituality.  
    
   
  I have this idea/philosophy that because of the inherent subjectivism of existence (stay with me, I'm not heading into full-blown subjectivism...), the only way that I can know the world as well as I can is through my senses and whatever I can garner from others' perspectives. Where is this relativity? It comes primarily from the natural human limitations of our sensory organs and our brains, and is built upon by the unique differences in abilities and experiences between individuals. Combine my poor eyesight, hypersensitivity to touch, my belief system, and the intricate web of my life experience, and you get an interesting "filter" for life.  
    
   
  Now imagine the possible permutations across the six billion-ish people (?) in existence presently.  
    
   
  Whether or not there is some "absolute" reality outside of our perceptions is up for debate and is actually rather irrelevant. What I can perceive is what there is. What someone else can perceive is what they have. With "perceive" extending to opinions/faith in the supra/supernatural, since emotions, thoughts, and experiences (that whole brain thing) are a crucial part of the "filter".  
    
   
  My goal, of course, is to widen my perceptions by learning about possibilities for alternates. (Why? Because it's something that draws me in and I've learned a lot of useful things this way.) For instance, I remember one issue that was brought up in the Theory of Knowledge class I took in high school was the fact that all of our scientific detecting equipment is, by requirement, based upon our five senses--we have things to make us see farther or with more depth, to hear things in ranges our ears don't hear, and to preserve records better than our brains' memory ever can. But the idea of equipment that detects based on some type of input that we don't even have a sensory organ for boggles the mind. How could we even develop such a system, since we have no concept of any other type of input other than what our five senses affords us? How would we interpret the data? We turn infrared spectra into visible colors based on temperature--so our perceptions of infrared are in terms of temperature (touch) and [artificial] color (sight). All that's doing is intensifying our sense of touch (effectively) and translating it into something visible. Not stepping outside of our boxes in any kind of of revolutionary, new-sensory input type of way, but widening our perceptions. And in such a manner, we think we can gather more information about the world around us.  
    
   
  I would maintain that this can be done on a personal, day-to-day basis. When I listen to someone tell me something about their history, this is some event that was filtered by that person when it occured, is refiltered everytime they think about it, was refiltered again when they vocalized it, and was filtered by me upon hearing it. That's a hell of a lot of "filters", but that's what's interesting: my immediate concern is what my and the speaker's current filters are and how they developed.  
    
   
  And how in tarnation does this relate to that old "present living" idea? Because the interesting challenge in learning about people is that all I can really get is a hint of a snapshot of the other person's current state, even when discussing their history, and this current state is constantly changing. And, because [to me] this is the only way I can and do see the world,  everything  is ephemeral, and what matters is the here and now.

  Past, present, future From Lissa-Love's 'Present Living' post....  
  #{TIGGR} - Well, again i disclaim my own work here...this is not my doing: thanks to Luke over at “Luke Says Moo!“ for this addition to a previous topic hosted here...here is an alteraative view on “Present Living“     
  I thought I'd give a little follow up because she keeps harassing me about it...and because it is something to think about on occasion. 
 Anyway, I classifymyself as someone who lives in the present. I don't dwell on the past or the future. I learn from my experiences and relish history when I have a chance to take it in. I plan for the future in some ways, but I don't plan for what my life will really be like. 
 Normally I move with the flow and do what needs to be done as the tide of the day brings changes with each ebb and flow. I know that I have little to no control over the actions of those around me and throughout the world, so I do my best to work with what I'm presented and go on from there.  
 Which brings me to thoughts on permanence. Lissa suggests that people living in the past and future deem that "for anything to have meaning, to be important, it must have longevity and be 'permanent'." Which seems like a good conclusion considering the present gives very little permanence to anything.  
 "The only thing that stays the same is everything changes." (Tracy Lawrence, "Time Marches On") 
 To me there is no permanence in this corporeal world because nothing can stay the same. Throughout human history, recorded or otherwise, everything has changed. Languages, cultures, war, kings, lands exchange owners, and even the Earth changes shape given enough time. Even the heavens mark the change in the passing of time. Stars burn out, new stars are formed, comets zip by, and space itself continues to change with each passing moment. 
 For that matter, neither the Earth nor the heavens mark any life except perhaps the very, very few that become part of ancient myths and modern histories. Even then, what we pervceive as permanent will eventually be washed away, like a sand castle on the beach, because time will wear away all meaning and the future generations will be left to wonder and speculate just as we do with the Aztecs, Mayans, Egytians, Greeks, Romans, the Aryan peoples, various African peoples I don't even know the names of, and I'm sure you get the point by now. Given enough time nothing that you or I understand as being permanent will be permanent. 
 Perhaps my concept of the future is too broad and those that live in the past and future only live in a narrow band of the past and future...perhaps just defining their present to be a few hundred years before and after their lifetime.  
 Anyway, I do believe there are permanent things in the world, but I can not empirically prove it's existence. I believe that the Creator has existed for all time and will continue to exist long after this world has been erased from the drawing board. I have faith that when I die my soul (spirit) will continue to live on as a unique individual like I am now and that I will spend the rest of eternity in bliss. 
 Perhaps it is my belief in the spiritual that frees me from the need of permanence in this world...then again I could just be screwed up in the head. You decide. 
 Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.  - Eckhart Tolle

                   Custom  Calendar Providers for Outlook 2003       Most data sets in the world have some  inherently elegant way of being expressed. Frequencies over time are naturally  rendered as histograms. Percentages are routinely conveyed by statisticians  through pie charts. More relevant to those of us who spend the majority of our  days in meetings, time-based data is often expressed in the form of a calendar.  In fact, calendars make our lives easier by organizing activities into  timelines, allowing us to view event-based data from any number of angles.       Unfortunately for a developer, the  acquisition of new event-based data sources often translates into writing new  calendar controls to display that data. And while this is certainly a manageable  if not resource-consuming task, many individuals and organizations already have  installed on their home and work computers one of the most full-featured and  robust calendaring application ever to be written. I'm of course referring to  Outlook. Microsoft&reg; Office Outlook&reg; 2003 has simply stunning calendaring  capabilities. With Outlook, I can view weekly highlights, monthly summaries, and  daily snapshots. I can view the calendar in standard form or as an organized  list of events. I can view my personal calendar side-by-side with that of my  teammates, gaining the ability to drag-and-drop scheduled items between them. I  can even display a Microsoft Windows&reg; SharePoint&#8482; Services event list as a  calendar within Outlook.     With this feature set, it'd be a shame  to have to reinvent the wheel every time someone required the ability to display  a new data source. For example, why can't I use Outlook's calendaring  capabilities to display my group's server downtime schedule as culled from the  servers' event logs? Why can't I use it to display my Windows Scheduled Tasks?  Why can't I use it to display recent posts from my favorite RSS feeds? And why  can't I use it to display the recording schedule from my Windows XP Media  Center? In fact (drum roll please), I can.

Programming in the Brain          I&#8217;m staring at source code again. &nbsp;   This time it&#8217;s not mine. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m  not looking for a flaw. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m not  trying to fix something. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m just  trying to understand; hundreds of files, thousands of functions, millions of  lines. &nbsp;  I stare at them and I read  them, not line by line. &nbsp;  I skip over  those and glance at declarations. &nbsp;  I  see words stitched together into names with parameters and types. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m not sure what they mean yet,  unfamiliar with the pattern. &nbsp;  I  don&#8217;t really know what the code inside does, but that&#8217;s just details. &nbsp;  I see the names to know who they are,  where they are. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m building a  roadmap in my brain.       &nbsp;      Soon the code takes shape to me. &nbsp;   It might have been hours or days, but eventually it is there. &nbsp;  I can now feel the code, a sensory  perception on the periphery of what is real. &nbsp;  I know how the code is defined, what its  facets look like, where they are placed. &nbsp;   I scroll through the files once more, seeing them again, like photographs  of old friends. &nbsp;  I look into each  and see references to others. &nbsp;  Look,  there&#8217;s that same little guy. &nbsp;  He&#8217;s  over here too. &nbsp;  I don&#8217;t know why,  but now I see how. &nbsp;  The code becomes  three dimensional, linked together in a graph, woven together like a tapestry;  function upon function, hierarchical and ordered.      &nbsp;        It&#8217;s only now that I begin to understand what it is that  the code actually does, a portrait forming in my mind, full and complete. &nbsp;  I had some idea going in, but that was a  base perception, a rough image painted with broad strokes.  &nbsp; Now I see the details, the intricacy, the  patterns and the truth. &nbsp;  I walk  through the code and feel it react. &nbsp;   I know where it is going and I know where it&#8217;s been. &nbsp;  I don&#8217;t need a machine to tell me  this. &nbsp;   &nbsp; It happens all inside my head as I sit in  the car driving to and from work, as I shower in the morning, as I lay awake at  night. &nbsp;            &nbsp;     But that's just  me.         &nbsp;     Matt       posted on Thursday,  May 20, 2004 10:09 AM

                 As  more children pop pills for attention deficit and other behavior disorders, new  figures show spending on those drugs has for the first time edged out the cost  of antibiotics and asthma medications for kids.       A 49 percent rise in the use of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder  drugs by children under 5 in the last three years contributed to a 23 percent  increase in usage for all children, according to an annual analysis of drug use  trends by Medco Health Solutions Inc.     "Behavioral medicines have eclipsed the other categories this year," said Dr.  Robert Epstein, Medco's chief medical officer. "It certainly reflects the  concern of parents that their children do as well as they can."     Antibiotics still top the list of the most commonly used children's drugs,  but parents are paying more for behavioral drugs, such as stimulants or  antidepressants, according to the analysis of drug use among 300,000 children  under 19....

                A  lot of people start their day with a big cup of coffee, hoping that the caffeine  will invigorate them. But findings published today in the May issue of the  journal SLEEP indicate that there might be a better way to stay awake for long  periods. According to the report, low doses of caffeine administered at regular  intervals may provide improved pick-me-up benefits.             James Wyatt of the Rush  University Medical Center and his colleagues studied 16 men for 29 days while  they stayed in private windowless suites free of time cues from the outside  world. The researchers scheduled 42.85-hour days for the subjects, simulating  the amount of time many doctors, truckers and emergency services personnel must  stay awake. By disrupting the men's circadian rhythms, which promote sleepiness  in a cyclical fashion, the scientists instead focused on the homeostatic push  for sleep, which becomes stronger the longer someone is awake. Previous analyses  of caffeine's ability to energize have shown that when people consume a large  amount of caffeine in one sitting, the levels of the compound in their  bloodstream will peak and then fall as the day goes on. "Unfortunately, the  physiological process they need to counteract is not a major player until the  latter half of the day," Wyatt explains. .......

Nathan Enns developed FyberSearch, a non-Google and non-Yahoo related search engine, when he was 18 years old. According to his about page, Enns "is now 19 as of March 21st and continues to be the sole owner of the web and image search engine." He created his engine out of frustration with current non-relevant search results.    
 
 
 
             His stated goal for    FyberSearch      is "not to collect as many web pages as possible, although it is important for any search engine to have a lot of web pages to search through. The FyberSearch mission statement is ‘Giving You The Control'. Nathan wants you to use the advanced settings to get exactly what you want instead of hoping that FyberSearch can read minds."   FyberSearch crawls webpages by using a personally designed spider called the FyberSpider. As of now, FyberSpider will obey The Robots Exclusion Protocol. FyberSpider will not obey The Robots META tag at this time. The current index of FyberSearch is not listed, and doesn't appear to be very large. Although, the functionality of FyberSearch is quite usable. ....   READ MORE...

       Yahoo boosts free e-mail storage to 100MB 
  Web portal Yahoo will begin offering "virtually unlimited storage" for  its paid e-mail customers and will upgrade free users to 100MB, an executive  said Thursday.   
  The upgrade is part of an overall enhancement for Yahoo Mail that will launch  this summer. Besides additional storage, the service will get a face-lift and  tie in more Yahoo-branded services, such as Photos and Messenger. 
 The announcement comes a month after  search rival  Google  said it would launch a  free e-mail  service  called Gmail that offers 1GB of storage, considerably more space  than free versions of Yahoo Mail and Microsoft's Hotmail. Yahoo currently offers  4MB of storage to free users of its e-mail service.

Testing Einstein From The Rim of a Black Hole...

Cambridge, MA -- It may soon be sink-or-swim time for Albert Einstein. Scientists are preparing for the ultimate test of Einstein's law of gravity, known as the theory of general relativity, through a systematic, in-depth study of hundreds of black holes. 


But there are really no losers in this exam. The observations will either strengthen Einstein's legacy or reveal flaws in general relativity that eventually will pave the road to a more complete theory.

      Cabir is a network worm (http://www.pcworld.com/resource/browse/0,cat,1539,sortIdx,1,00.asp) that infects phones running the Symbian mobile phone operating system by Symbian. No infections have been reported. Cabir may be a proof of concept worm from an international group of virus writers known as 29a that is credited with the release of a recent virus, "Rugrat," that targets Windows 64-bit operating systems, the Moscow-based company said. 

Cabir spreads between mobile phones using a specially formatted Symbian operating system distribution (or SIS) file disguised as a security management utility. When the infected file is launched, the mobile phone's screen displays the word "Caribe" and the worm modifies the Symbian operating system so that Cabir is started each time the phone is turned on. 

Once it has infected a mobile phone, Cabir scans for other phones (http://www.pcworld.com/howto/article/0,aid,113737,00.asp) using Bluetooth wireless technology, then sends a copy of itself to the first vulnerable phone it finds, Kaspersky said. 

 urlLink http://www.pcworld.com/partners/avantgo/article/0,aid,116508,00.asp 
 urlLink http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/ 



Proof of Concept?
Nokia phones that use the Symbian operating system are vulnerable to the worm. Handsets made by other manufacturers may also be susceptible to Cabir, Kaspersky said. 

The virus does not appear to have any malicious payload, which is consistent with other viruses, including Rugrat, that are believed to come from the 29a group, Kaspersky said. 

In May, researchers from Symantec identified W634.Rugrat.3344 (http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,116311,00.asp) and linked it to a family of six viruses called W32.Chiton.gen that are all believed to be the work of the same author or group of authors. Each virus in the family demonstrates a different "first ever" infection technique, including W32.Shrug, the first known virus to use the Thread Local Storage structures in Windows NT, 2000, and XP to run virus code, and W32.Chthon, the first virus to run as a native application in Windows NT, 2000 and XP, Symantec said. 

No other leading antivirus makers including Symantec, Network Associates, and Sophos PLC have yet issued advisories about Cabir.

http://www.rednova.com/news/stories/1/2004/06/06/story001.html  

When ESA’s Huygens spaceprobe, travelling on board NASA's Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn, lands on the planet's largest moon Titan in January 2005, not only will it carry a variety of scientific instruments, but also music ‘made in Europe’.  

The purpose of putting music on the spacecraft is to strengthen the knowledge of ESA’s Huygens mission to Titan, by aiming to leave a trace of our humanity in the unknown and to build awareness about this adventure, especially among young people.   

Four musical themes composed by French musicians Julien Civange and Louis Haéri were placed on board ESA’s Huygens probe in October 1997.   

After a seven-year and 4000 million kilometre journey, the music will reach Titan on 14 January 2005. This will be the furthest distance at which human-made sounds will have landed on another celestial body.

VOMIT! - listen to this:

Although Iraq is a major petroleum producer, the country has little capacity to refine its own gasoline. So the U.S. government pays about $1.50 a gallon to buy fuel in neighboring countries and deliver it to Iraqi stations. A three-month supply costs American taxpayers more than $500 million, not including the cost of military escorts to fend off attacks by Iraqi insurgents. 
 
The arrangement keeps a fleet of 4,200 tank trucks constantly on the move, ferrying fuel to Iraq. 
 
"We thank the Americans," Baghdad taxi driver Osama Hashim said. "They risked their lives to liberate us and now they are improving our lives," said Hashim, 26, topping up the tank on his beat-up 1983 Volkswagen.

 
 urlLink BAGHDAD, Iraq - While Americans are shelling out record prices for fuel, Iraqis pay only about 5 cents a gallon for gasoline — a benefit of hundreds of millions of dollars subsidies bankrolled by American taxpayers.

                   Abstract       A method and system are provided for  extending the functionality of application buttons on a limited resource  computing device. Alternative application functions are launched based on the  length of time an application button is pressed. A default function for an  application is launched if the button is pressed for a short, i.e., normal,  period of time.

                   Abstract       A new and distinct variety of  apple tree which originated as a sport limb mutation of `Wells and Wade  cultivar` Oregon Spur.RTM. of red delicious apple tree (U.S. Plant Pat. No.  2,816), characterized by a more uniform deeper red color, developing much  earlier than fruit of other red delicious varieties, and having a thicker stem  and longer, deeper red leaf midvein.

July 28, 2004

The trouble is, all those 'labour-saving' devices actually don't save time, writes Ross Gittins.
I've long been fascinated by the subject of time, but frustrated that I never seem to get the chance to study what the philosophers, sociologists and economists have had to say about it. So I lost no time in buying the new book by Carl Honore, In Praise of Slowness, published in the US by HarperCollins. 
The thing about time is that whether we're rich or poor we each get an identical allocation of it - 24 hours in a day, seven days in a week - and its supply is fixed. That makes time scarce - a valuable commodity - and economics is the study of scarcity and how we can get round it. 
The problem of time's scarcity goes to the heart of the way capitalist economies are organised and the way they evolve. Indeed, capital gains its value from the fact that we use it to achieve more with our time. "

 Contributed by Mike on Thursday, July 29th, 2004 @ 10:17AM
from the well,-they-want-more-of-everything... dept.
It's unfortunate that companies still feel the need to equate patents to 'innovation' when the opposite is often true. These days, unfortunately, many companies feel the need to get patents simply as a defensive measure. Whether for defense or offense, it appears that Bill Gates believes Microsoft needs more patents. The company is ramping up their efforts to file for more patents and plan to extort license them to other businesses. So far, they're off to a good start. Some recently noted Microsoft patents include saving the name of a game you're playing, showing that someone is 'typing a message' in IM software, thread based email, writing an application in HTML, grouping programs together in the taskbar, pronouns used in programming and the concept of giving 'kudos' points for style and flair. Well, kudos to Microsoft then, on the style and flair with which they've been granted so many questionable patents. "

           Remote-Controlled Throwable Robots...         Carnegie Mellon University robotics researchers, in conjunction with the U.S. Marine Corps? Warfighting Laboratory, have developed a    small, throwable, remote-controlled prototype robot      designed for surveillance in urban settings, several of which are being sent to Iraq for testing. The robot, known as Dragon Runner, has the ability to see around corners and deliver information to Marines while keeping them out of danger in urban settings where human access is impractical, dangerous or unsustainable.  And of course to look for Sarah Connor (Terminator, just in case you didn't get the link).       Don't let my manager know about these...

Karlheinz Brandenburg, one of the inventors of the MP3 format and the director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Media Technology, has served up new superrealistic audio technology called Iosono that he hopes will revolutionize sound in theaters, theme parks, and eventually the home.    
      Bottom line:  &nbsp;The product, which is being touted as true "three dimensional" audio, marks a substantial break from the way recorded sound has been replicated since Edison first began experimenting with recorded audio.     
    A new spatial, immersive, sound system called IOSONO, which creates an unparalleled listening experience, was introduced to the Hollywood entertainment industry today by Prof. Dr. Karlheinz Brandenburg, the often called "father of MP3".    
   Developed by a team at the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology IDMT (which is part of Europe's largest applied research group) under the lead of Brandenburg, Dr. Thomas Sporer and Dr. Sandra Brix, IOSONO is the first system to project sounds as if they are coming from a specific spot inside or outside the listening area. It provides a perfectly balanced "sweet spot" for every spectator, no matter where they are positioned in the audience. IOSONO was introduced at postproduction sound iconTodd-AO, at an event hosted by the Entertainment Technology Center at the University of South California (ETC-USC).   
  IOSONO applies Wave Field Synthesis (WFS), as originally invented by Delft Technical University, and several newly patented hardware and software technologies. It was designed for application in cinemas, theme parks, music and entertainment venues and home theatres."   
  The enhancement from 5.1 to IOSONO can be compared to the step from Mono to Stereo. Due to the groundbreaking object-oriented approach of IOSONO, it enables the sound engineers to create sound events anywhere in the room", Brandenburg describes the major advance of the innovative system.  
   IOSONO Sound Transforms Audience Experience   
  IOSONO produces a virtual sound cape of unequalled fidelity by projecting pinpoints and planes of sounds. The pinpoints can seem as if coming from the sky above, inches from the listener's ears, or any position in space; the walls can, among other applications, simulate the ambient sound sense of another place. Filmmakers, artists, entertainers and audio professionals will be able to direct a cymbal to thunderclap miles away, a wagon train to encircle the audience, or an alien to crash through the wall. In addition, filmmakers can choose to make sounds move from left to right with the action on the screen. IOSONO recreates natural sound waves using WFS, as opposed to other solutions that employ amplification. The IOSONO system is comprised of the Spatial Audio Workstation, which is used to create the IOSONO "soundtrack"; an IOSONO server, installed in each venue to configure an IOSONO produced sound experience to the specific environment; and a 360 ring of speakers, hung in a specially phased, calibrated fashion.  
  The IOSONO system complements existing audio postproduction practices by working with sound files generated by standard mixing software such as ProTools.

   Parallel Polarity   
   Though this is not actually my work, i think this is great.&nbsp; Thanx to      Matt at The Wayward Weblog      for this gem..   
 
  Sometimes scientific discoveries are not made in the lab, sometimes they are born out of conjecture and backed up by observation alone.&nbsp; Thank goodness for that or I'd have never discovered the truth.&nbsp; I suppose many of you have thoughts on occasion that traverse the wide open possibilities of our reality, pondering classical conundrums and esoterica that on the surface seem like silly notions, so seldom do you venture much deeper.&nbsp; I, on the other hand, take great pride in plummeting head first into abstract thought and taking even somewhat clever notions beyond into the realm of abject absurdity.  
  You might think I do this with the noble intention of seeking out a laugh, something to tickle the funny bone of my family and friends or to evoke a short chuckle from me alone as I sit in a meeting ignoring everything else but my own little amusements.&nbsp; But this is not the case.&nbsp; I do have a more serious destination&nbsp;and&nbsp;I am most diligent in its pursuit.&nbsp; Certainly, I cannot escape the&nbsp;onset of&nbsp;laughter as I do uncover the ridiculous and&nbsp;bizarre.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;to be expected.&nbsp; It&nbsp;comes with the territory, and I don't mind it one bit; it soothes the soul and is the medicine for what ails you.&nbsp; Yet, however delightful that feeling of&nbsp;levity may be, it is nothing compared the utter&nbsp;joy felt when&nbsp;I finally stumble upon a revelation that is destined to rock the foundation of understanding that&nbsp;I and everyone else on this great green ball cling to daily.  
  That's why I spared no time in rushing to my PC this morning in order to craft this post, because I knew I finally had something of note that when shared with rest of humanity might just change the way we look at ourselves, the world around us and in truth the fabric of reality that underpins our very existence.&nbsp; So without further ado, I'll just blurt it out and then get on with the explanation and supporting evidence.&nbsp;   
  It has come to my attention, through observation, deep analysis and profound insight, that travel between parallel dimensions is not only possible, it is happening all the time.&nbsp; Now, before you commit me to the loony bin, hear me out so you will feel confident that you had all the facts, all the arguments and proofs.&nbsp;   
  Certainly, this might seem a big deal.&nbsp; Am I talking about Slider-esque travel through a vortex into a parallel dimension, where people look like us but are up to no good?&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; I'm not talking big science-fiction Hollywood style travel, or even highly speculative jaunts through a black hole (especially since Stephen dashed my hopes on that one.)&nbsp; I'm talking about everyday, normal slips between realities that we experience even though we don't know that it is happening.  
  You see, as it turns out, the walls between parallel realities are not so thick at all.&nbsp; They're not even walls really, just sort of a conceptual boundary.&nbsp; The closer any two realities are to one another, the more they sort of touch, overlapping one another if you will.&nbsp; So another universe&nbsp;where I diverge from myself quite considerably, or apes rule the planet would actually be so&nbsp;drastically different there would unlikely be slips large enough to send anyone from here to there.&nbsp; However, realities that diverge only slightly, so subtly that they are almost identical except to the trained and diligent mind, they are in fact so close that they overlap entirely.&nbsp; Between these we travel constantly, slipping in and out of each without a second thought.  
  The real trick to recognizing that these traversals do indeed occur is to observe it in action.&nbsp; Take any monumental event that you and others may have experienced in the recent past.&nbsp; Ask each person involved to write down exactly what happened.&nbsp; Compare.&nbsp; You'll find a quite a deviation between observers.&nbsp; Is this because each is so inept as to be unable to recognize what you have obviously recalled as the truth?&nbsp; Or could it be that each has remembered the event quite accurately, yet their experiences diverge due to differences in reality at the time of observation?  
  This is not just hypothetical.&nbsp; It happens to me all the time.&nbsp;  
  Have you ever looked at&nbsp;a written word and thought, ?that doesn't look right??&nbsp; Well, it doesn't because you've shifted realities.&nbsp;   
  Have you ever&nbsp;started thinking something that you&nbsp;later find out your spouse, sibling or friend was also thinking?&nbsp; Without ever talking?&nbsp; Well, you did in a different reality.  
  This is why you always feel out of sorts.&nbsp; The rules keep changing.&nbsp; You're never really in the same place again.&nbsp; You keep slipping.  
  Have you ever looked at the keyboard and wondered what happened to the Quelm?&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; It was sort of a squarish letter.&nbsp; And this one, 'Z', I can't quite recall ever&nbsp;using seeing that one before.

      Microsoft pays Lindows.com $20M to end trademark fight
 
WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Lindows.com said Microsoft (MSFT) will pay $20 million to settle a trademark dispute between the companies, according to a Monday regulatory filing. Under the settlement, Microsoft will buy the rights to the Lindows.com domain name along with other related sites. Microsoft sued the company in 2001 claiming the company infringed on Microsoft's trademark patents for its Windows operating system. Shares gained 28 cents to $27.76 in morning trading.

   Has MasterCard gone on a phishing trip, leaving the back door wide open?     Author:   ZapTheDingbat    Released: Monday 28/06/04  
  In the wake of MasterCard and NameProtect?s recent PR hype announcing their aggressive drive to fight fraud on the web, this dynamic duo seem to have missed some all too basic gaps in their own security.  
  Along with their colleagues at Natwest, Barclaycard, WorldPay, Nochex and even the GCHQ, not to mention an almost endless list of further high profile sites, MasterCard have still left chinks in the armour of their own site.  
  The oversight of some basic security flaws allows hackers to send a user to the site while displaying any content and functionality of the hacker?s choice.  
  The security flaw that so many of these sites have overlooked is that of ?cross site scripting? or ?script injection?. At face value, this flaw seems not a great threat, being nothing more complex than echoing back what gets typed in a textbox. The reality is that this simple oversight throws open the doors to an even more dangerous breed of the very ?Phishing? scams that Mastercard has pledged to stop.

    Beta 1   
 
 
 
 
    Introduction    
 
   AutoCode v2.0 is an Add-In for Visual Studio .net that enables  autocomplete  for any language in Visual Studio .net. Generated code is based in command templates that can be easily created with  AutoCode Editor .    
   
   For example, typing in the editor:   
   
    Hello World! ws    
   
   And pressing Control+Enter, we get:   
   
    Console.WriteLine( "Hello World!" )    
   
   The template command ?ws? is one of the different command templates that comes with AutoCode, but what makes AutoCode a powerful tool is the ability to easily create new custom templates.   
   
   Version 2.0 includes:   
   
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Smart templates using ASPX like syntax      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Set cursor position      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Create, edit and organize templates with the built-in editor      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Multiple file templates to be easily shared      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    More new cool features?

This is pretty interesting.. the Mono project has released v1.0, this brings some of the power of .NET and C# programming to Linux developers - it's also interesting to see that the Mono group is about 18 months behind Microsoft in release schedules and that J2EE gets a whack - here's a quote from the article...
'The problem with J2EE really is that it became very, very academic and the complexity of all these perfectly designed systems in schools does not necessarily map when you have deadlines and all kinds of other things.'

Introduction
For the past five years, software developers targeting the corporate environment have faced a difficult tradeoff when deciding between the browser-based, thin client application model and its rich client counterpart.
The browser-based application is easy to install and maintain, can target many desktops, and has no impact on the state of the client computer. Yet in spite of these advantages, the browser-based model is far from perfect. Rich client applications provide a richer user interface (UI) along with access to the local disk and local application programming interfaces (APIs), further empowering the developer and resulting in a more productive user experience. Because they run locally on the client computer, rich client applications also make for more efficient use of available resources, eliminate the issue of network latency, and enable the user to work offline."

Hawking changes his mind on black holes
Galactic traps may actually allow information to escape, author says

Hawking will present his findings at the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation in Dublin, Ireland on July 21.
By Jane Wardell
The Associated Press
Updated: 4:47 p.m. ET July 16, 2004After almost 30 years of arguing that a black hole swallows up everything that falls into it, astrophysicist Stephen Hawking backpedaled Thursday. In doing so, he lost one of the most famous bets in recent scientific history.

   Copy Protection Robs The Future   
   Copy protection will break the chain of formal and informal archivists who are necessary to the long-term preservation of creative works.   
     &nbsp; 
   Introduction   
     
  The other day I wanted to listen to a song I remember from my youth. I took the old vinyl record out of its sleeve and put it on my aging turntable. I gently dropped the needle onto the appropriate track, and out came the music, but it was way too fast. It seems my turntable broke, and now plays everything at exactly 45 rpm instead of 33. Bummer! It was a slow song and I wanted it slow. Luckily, I found I had another copy of the same song that the record company that owned the rights to the song had released (the CD was "Greatest Folksingers of the 'Sixties"). Much nicer. Unfortunately, they had only included that one song -- I couldn't play any of the others I wanted from the original album. I'll have to try to fix my turntable.  
   
  This got me to thinking about preserving old works of composers, musicians, authors, and other creative individuals. How does that preserving come about and will today's works produced on digital media last into the future?  
   
   How are works preserved through the generations?   
   &nbsp; 
   .......Enter copy protection....   
     
  There are things happening that make me worry that the future may not be bright for preserving many of the works we create today. For example: Companies are     preparing     to produce music CDs that cannot be copied into many other formats (something allowed by law as "fair use"). Most new eBooks are copy protected. A     new bill     may be heading to Congress that will require all digital devices to enforce copy protection schemes for copyrightable material. An     existing law     makes it a crime to tell people how to make copies of protected works.   
  I believe that  copy protection will break the chain necessary to preserve creative works . It will make them readable for a limited period of time and not be able to be moved ahead as media deteriorates or technologies change. Only those works that are thought to be profitable at any given time will be preserved by their "owners" (if they are still in business). We know from history that what's popular at any given time is no certain indication of what will be valuable in the future. Without not-copy protected "originals", archivists, collectors, and preservers will be unable to maintain them the way they would if they weren't protected. (Many of these preservers ignore fashion as they do their job, because they see their role as preservers not filters.) We won't even be able to read media in obsolete formats, because the specifications of those formats will not be available.  To create a "Rosetta Stone" of today's new formats will be asking to go to jail  and having your work banned.   
  This is different than encryption or patent protection. With encryption, as long as the keys for reading survive, and a description of the method of decryption, you can recreate the unprotected original. It's even better -- you can prove authenticity. Patent protection just keeps you from creating and using your own unlicensed reader for a limited period of time. After that, the legal duty of the patent is to teach you how it works so you can make your own. For long-term preservation of works (as opposed to short-term quick advancement in some fields) patented techniques are good because they discourage secrets and eventually put things in the public domain.   
  Let me give you  another personal example , this time about copy protection.   
  One of the most popular parts of this web site is     a copy of the original IBM PC version of VisiCalc    . Actually, that's not exactly true. It's not the same exact program you could buy.  The original VisiCalc was only shipped on 5 1/4" copy protected diskettes.  Part of the program checked that the diskette it was loaded from had the special copy protection modifications. Despite the fact that I have an old computer with a 5 1/4" diskette drive, I still  couldn't make a copy that would run that I could distribute . I received permission from the current copyright holder to distribute the copies, but VisiCalc hadn't been produced for years and they lost track of any original masters they had owned. (Companies usually don't have reason to maintain and catalog old, non-profitable material for too long, especially through mergers and acquisitions.) Luckily for me, an  employee of Software Arts , my company that created the original program,  kept a "test" copy we had used internally that was created without the copy protection code . He was not one of the original authors, but is an informal "collector" of things. He ended up at Lotus, the next owners of the rights. He left Lotus years later, and gave me a copy he had moved ahead from system to system after that (he produced the copy for me on a Windows NT machine). Thanks to Lotus' permission (which I wouldn't need in the far future when the copyright expires), I was able to post a copy on the Web, and now many tens of thousands of people have their own copies.  Thanks to those not-copy protected copies, and the documentation available about the original IBM PC, it is much more likely now that future generations will be able to learn about early PC programs by running VisiCalc.  If only the original diskettes could be passed down, then after they deteriorated they would not be useable, and until then, only people with special obsolete equipment could run them.

Many things in society are long-term    
     
  In many human endeavors, we create infrastructure to support our lives which we then rely upon for a long period of time. We have always built shelter. Throughout most of recorded history, building or buying a home was a major starting step to growing up. This building would be maintained and used after that, often for the remainder of the builder's life span and in many instances beyond. Components would be replaced as they wore out, and the design often took the wear and tear of normal living into account. As needs changed, the house might be modified. In general, though, you thought of a house as having changes measured in decades.   
  Likewise, human societies also create infrastructure that are built once, then used and trusted for a long period of time. Such infrastructure includes roads, bridges, water and power distribution systems, sewers, seaports and airports, and public recreational areas. These also would be used and maintained without major modifications after they were built, often for many decades or even centuries.   
    Software has been short-term    
     
  By contrast, software has historically been built assuming that it will be replaced in the near future (remember the Y2K problem). Most developers observe the constant upgrading and replacement of software written before them and follow in those footsteps with their creations. In the early days of computer software, the software was intimately connected to the hardware on which it ran, and as that hardware was replaced by new, better hardware, new software was built to go with it. In the early days, many uses of computing power were new -- they were the first application of software to problems that were previously done manually or not at all. The world got used to the fact that the computer version was an alternative and the special features and cost savings were what was special.   
  Today, hardware is capable enough that software can be written that will continue to run unmodified as hardware is changed. Computers are no longer new alternatives to other applications -- they are the only alternative. Despite this, old thinking and methodologies have remained.   
  Computers and computer software have been viewed as being valuable for no longer than common short-term durable goods like an automobile or sometimes even tires. In accounting, common depreciation terms for software are 3 to 5 years; 10 at most. Contrast this to residential rental property which is depreciated over 27.5 years and water mains and brick walls which are depreciated over 60 years or more......

The Humanoid Project  
  The Humanoid Project is a project being undertaken at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. The long term aim is to build a life-sized humanoid robot which is capable of walking, navigating around obstacles, and operating completely autonomously whilst being controlled verbally. To date a 60cm tall prototype robot named Elvis has been built (see below).     The behaviours of the robot, such as walking, are entirely developed using evolutionary software. This software employs genetic algorithms to enable the robot to teach itself to maintain balance and walk. Thus adaptability is placed before precision.   
   Elvis, The Prototype:   The prototype robot is bipedal and has human-like geometry &amp; motion. It has legs, arms and hands all controlled by 42 servos. Senses are provided by microphones, cameras, touch sensors.   
  Evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming are used in three hierarchical layers used for control:   
  Reactive layer - for reactive behaviours such as balancing.  Model building layer - for memories of past events, evolving models and basic control tasks.  Reasoning layer - for symbolic processing, higher brain functions such as navigation and safety.  Behaviours and Control:  Balancing - achieved through touch sensors on the feet to find the centre of gravity and two electronic gyros mounted in the head to minimize head movements. The robot is initially suspended in a safety harness with a sensor to detect total loss of balance. Evolutionary algorithms in the reactive and model building layers enable the robot to learn to walk and balance.  Vision - the robot has two CCD cameras for stereo vision. A program is evolved to build a 3D model of the environment. Another program is then evolved which uses this 3D map to build generalised representations of 3D objects such as boxes and cones.  Navigation - the third symbolic reasoning layer is used to integrate vision and walking to follow walls and avoid obstacles.  Audio orientation - 2 microphones are used for stereophonic hearing. A Genetic Programming system evolves a program to determine the direction sound and to focus the robots attention. Future work will be on separation of sound sources and recognition of commands.  Manipulation - each hand has 2 fingers and a thumb. Each is equipped with touch sensors capable of sensing forces from 10g to tens of Kg's.   
   Future Plans:   The prototype robot is not yet fully autonomous. It is currently controlled by a remote NT Workstation and power supply. The plan is to make it fully autonomous by including an onboard power supply and main processing unit - perhaps a handheld PC. Total weight should be less than 5Kg. The long term aim is a human sized humanoid weighing 60Kg.

   Computing with Leech Neurons    
  Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA have extracted living neurons from leeches and connected them, through micro-electrodes, to a computer. By stimulating the neurons in a specific way and recording their responses it was possible to get the neurons to perform rudimentary calculations such as adding two numbers.     The experimental set-up (pictured below) consisted of just a handful of neurons placed in a petri dish. Leech neurons were used because they have been extensively studied in the past and their behaviours are well understood. The neurons were not manually connected together. Rather, they were encouraged to grow and form synapses of their own accord.    This research is still in its very early stages. Professor William Ditto, the leader of the team at Georgia Tech, says that he hopes to go on to build much larger versions of these biological computers. Eventually such cultured neurons could be integrated with artificial eyes and ears to give a complete robot brain. The advantages of such biological computers would be their increased flexibility. They are not restricted by the rigid programming rules of today's computers. Instead they could work things out for themselves.   
   Neurobiology of Leeches:   The leech is an annelid, the biological grouping which includes earthworms. The Latin name for the well known blood sucking leech is Hirundinea Medicinalis. It is this species which is applied to wounds so as to remove possible infection.   
  The leech is comprised of 1 head segment and 21 body segments. The head segment contains the brain (in 2 parts, dorsal and ventral). Each of the body segments has a ganglion of about 400 neurons. These ganglion are not much smaller than the brain. Thus the total number of neurons per leech is 15,000 to 20,000.   
  One reason that the leech nervous system has been so well studied is that its neurons are relatively large (60m). The morphology of the neurons is also remarkably uniform between ganglia and animals. The neurons in the head, being smaller, are less well understood.   
  It is remarkable that despite its relative paucity of neurons the leech is capable of such an array of movements and behaviours (body waving, crawling, swimming, shortening, foraging for food, feeding, and mating).   
   Leech Neuroscience at Emory University:   This research into computing with leech neurons is being conducted in collaboration with scientists at Emory university, also in Atlanta, Georgia. The focus of their research is the neural circuit which controls the leech heart. Oscillatory neurons in the 3rd and 4th ganglion are found to be coupled with the heart interneurons of the 1st and 2nd ganglion. Together these cells form the timing network which controls the rhythmic motor cells of the heart.

    Senate Bill Targets Phishers    
   Internet scam artists who use fake Web sites to dupe people into revealing sensitive financial information could face up to five years in jail and forced to pay $250,000 in fines under a bill introduced late last week in the Senate.   The legislation, introduced last Friday, is designed to fight "phishing," one of the newest and most dangerous forms of online fraud.   
  Maybe I missed the note, but I was under the impression that "phishing" (tricking people into filling out their personal info into a site they believe is a financial site like Paypal or their bank, but which is really the scammer's own site) was already pretty damn illegal. After all, it is tricking someone into revealing their bank account info, which will then most likely be used to steal money from them. However, just for good measure, a new      anti-phishing bill has been introduced in the Senate     , making sure it's even more illegal. The argument for doing this is that it's currently difficult to prosecute those scammers involved with phishing, but it's not entirely clear why. It seems like setting up a website to defraud people out of their bank account or credit card info should be an open and shut case of fraud.

     nUnit: Simplified Database Unit testing using Enterprise Services      
       &nbsp; 
    Introduction    
   Test Driven Development makes life easier. Unit tests are the lifeblood of a good Test Driven Development approach (and thus, are also the lifeblood of most of the agile methodologies out there such as XP, Scrum and others). Therefore it stands to reason that one should strive to create unit tests with the least amount of work and maintenance, which will in turn allow the developer to focus on the business problem at hand and the various design and algorithms needed to create a working product/component.   
     &nbsp; 
   For the past couple of years I?ve been struggling with Unit tests, That is, I?ve used them in major production projects and have seen the good and the bad that can come from a fully test Driven approach. I?ll let the ?good? part be taken care of by the numerous other articles out there that talk about the benefits you get from Unit Tests and TDD, and will focus on one of the most problematic parts of Unit tests in a real world project ? testing against the database.   
     &nbsp; 
   Testing Data Access layer components (DALs for short) is problematic in a number of ways. The number one reason f is this:   
     &nbsp; 
   Testing the various CRUD(Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on a single class can result in a massive amount of ?garbage? data residing on the test database (You  are  using a test database, aren?t you?). This creates several problems:   
      1.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Problem: Garbage Data      
   Your database will eventually be full of junk data which you?ll need to get rid of sooner or later   
     &nbsp; 
      2.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Problem: Affecting other tests      
   Worst, you may break one of the golden rules of unit testing:&nbsp;  No test should be dependent on another test to perform correctly . That is, you should be able to run your tests in  any  order you choose or maybe just one of them at a time, and they should all still work. That means that every test needs to start with a known state on which it will act. For DALs this usually means a known state of records in the database.    
   But guess what? When you test CRUD operations you?re actually changing the state of the database, so the next test that will be run that might depend on a specific record being there might fail because you just deleted that record in your current test. Anything can happen.   
     &nbsp; 
      3.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Problem: starting tests from a known state      
   This is the other side of the previous problem: My test needs to have something in the database in order to perform correctly. For example ? it needs a specific ?category? entity in the Category tables in order to test inserting a child ?Product? into the Products table. I need to make sure I insert these values into the database before I perform the test, but I also want to make sure that data is no longer there after I finish my test.   
     &nbsp; 
   Dealing with the problems   
   So how do you deal with all this garbage data that?s making your database and tests unstable? Obviously, you need to make sure that before and after each test you leave the database in the same state that you got it in. That is ? you need to ?undo? your CRUD operations after testing them. Here are some of the most prevalent methods used to achieve this.....

   Introducing: NUnitX and the Rollback attribute - Seamless database rollback with Nunit      
  My article on    performing database unit tests with rollback ability    has managed to get quite a lot of attention. There were some caveats to that method, though:  
 
  You had to inherit from ServicedComponent thus limiting your inheritance chain  
  It meant you had to strong name your assemblies  
  Some trouble was encountered when running the tests through the NUnit GUI (disposing objects too soon) for some people.  
  All tests were run under the same transaction context   
  The other way to go on this was to use the method called "Services without components" - mainly utilising the ServiceDomain and the ServiceConfig classes found in the System.EnterpriseServices namespace, but are relatively unknown or unused. I won't extend the discussion of the actual technicalities here because I'm planning at article on this subject, but for now you can enjoy the fruits of this research today.  
  What I  really wanted  was to be able to write something as elegant as this:  
   [ Test , Rollback ]   
    public    void   Insert ()    
   {   
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  //Do some inserts into the DB here     
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  //and the automatically roll back     
   }   
   
  So, I dug deep into the bowels of the Nunit Framework and came out with something that did exactly that -&nbsp; I added a new attribute to the framework -   
   RollbackAttribute   
  by placing that attribute on a test method that test case will automatically run inside its own transaction context, and automatically roll back at the end of the test. It's really quite cool and I'm using it today in our applications.  
  yes. using it looks exactly like this:  
    
   [ Test , Rollback ]   
    public    void   Insert ()    
   {   
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  //Do some inserts into the DB here     
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  //and the automatically roll back     
   }   
  So - I went ahead and compiled a custom version of the NUnit framework just for you. I like to call it NunitX - it is a mutant and as such must have a cool name. Hope you agree.

  Tax Cuts A Simple Lesson in Economics&nbsp;  
  &nbsp;        Let?s put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand         
     &nbsp;     
     Suppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner. &nbsp;  The bill for all ten comes to $100. &nbsp;  If they paid their bill the way the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:       &nbsp;    
 
 
     The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.        
 
     The fifth would pay $1        
 
     The Sixth would pay $3        
 
     The Seventh $7        
 
     The Eighth $12        
 
     The Ninth $18        
 
     The Tenth man (the richest) would pay $59       &nbsp;      
     So, that?s what they decided to do.       
    &nbsp;    
     The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement until, one day, the owner threw them a curve. &nbsp;  ?Since you are such good customers,? he said, ?I?m going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20.?       
    &nbsp;    
     So, now the dinner for all ten only cost $80. &nbsp;  The group still wanted to pay their bill in the way we pay our taxes.       
    &nbsp;    
     So, the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. &nbsp;  But what about the other six, the paying customers? &nbsp;  How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his ?fair share??       
    &nbsp;    
     The six men realized that $20 divided by 6 is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody?s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to eat their meal!       
    &nbsp;    
     So, the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man?s bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each would pay. And so:       
    &nbsp;    
 
     The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).       
     The sixth man now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings)       
     The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings)       
     The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings)       
     The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings)       
     The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings)        
    &nbsp;    
     Each of the six was better off than before. &nbsp;  And the first four continued to eat for free. &nbsp;  But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.       
    &nbsp;    
     ?I only got a dollar out of the $20,? declared the sixth man. &nbsp;  He pointed to the tenth man ?but he got $10!?       
    &nbsp;    
     ?Yeah, that?s right,? exclaimed the fifth man, ?I only saved a dollar, too. &nbsp;  It?s unfair that he got ten times more than me!?       
    &nbsp;    
     ?That?s true!? shouted the seventh man, ?Why should he get $10 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!?       
    &nbsp;    
     ?Wait a minute,? yelled the first four men in unison, ?We didn?t get anything at all. &nbsp;  The system exploits the poor!?       
    &nbsp;    
     The nine men surrounded the tenth man and beat him up.       
    &nbsp;    
     The next night the tenth man didn?t show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. &nbsp;  But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. &nbsp;  They didn?t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!       
    &nbsp;    
      And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how the tax system works. &nbsp;  The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. &nbsp;  Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up at the table anymore. There are lots of good restaurants in     Europe  and the  Caribbean!

  One way to make a blue moon: use a blue filter. That's what Kostian Iftica did on July 2nd when he photographed this full moon rising over Brighton, Mass.    - click to enlarge.    
 
        
   The month of July 2004 has two full moons, which means one of them is a Blue Moon. But will it really be blue? Believe it or not, scientists say blue-colored moons are real.   
    
     Science@NASA  -- When you hear someone say "Once in a Blue Moon?" you know what they mean: Rare. Seldom. Maybe even absurd. After all, when was the last time you saw the moon turn blue?    
    
  On July 31st, you should look, because there's going to be a Blue Moon.   
    
  According to modern folklore, a Blue Moon is the second full moon in a calendar month. Usually months have only one full moon, but occasionally a second one sneaks in. Full moons are separated by 29 days, while most months are 30 or 31 days long; so it is possible to fit two full moons in a single month. This happens every two and a half years, on average.

  Fractals As Body Language   &nbsp;   
  This is really interesting. Talk about an innovative approach to a problem! Some "researchers from Switzerland and South Africa" (that's all the detail they give) realized that when you have an intelligent machine, it is difficult to know exactly what it's doing, such as waiting for you to tell it something, or thinking, or whatever. That is, it has no body language. They figured out a pretty darned cool way to use fractal visuals to let an observer know what's going on inside the machine's figurative head:     Fractals Show Machine Intentions     They say "initial practical applications of the researchers' work are about five years away", but I think that assumes use in robots only. I believe this sort of tech could be applied much earlier to intelligent  software . I hope they consider it.

It's not often someone asks police to arrest him, but that's what happened early Tuesday morning in Williamsport, Pa.
Police say 27-year-old Patrick McCarty did just that before 1 a.m. Tuesday morning.
McCarty allegedly told police he wanted to be arrested 'for being stupid.'
When police told him that wasn't a crime, he took police to his apartment and handed over marijuana and drug paraphernalia.
McCarty is being held now in lieu of $10,000 bail on drug charges. "

The University of New Brunswick could be facing a human rights complaint after it told a blind student from Quebec that his guide dog would have to learn English.  Yvon Tessier was kicked out of UNB's English Immersion program because he only gives commands to his guide dog in French.  He was asked to sign a declaration that he would only speak to his dog in English.  Tessier says that would only confuse the dog, and university officials would not accommodate him.  He's now considering a complaint with the Human Rights Commission."

   {TIGGR}: I have said it before, but i just wont stop....STOP PATENT ABUSE..10 Years Jail for offenders who attempt to aquire patents for items to which they are not entitled: baybe THAT is how we stop these prix...   
 Xybernaut, the grandfather of well-hyped "wearable computing" that perpetually seems to have problems actually selling products has now announced    two wearable computing patents   , both of which seem pretty questionable. The first is for an "ergonomic display," which apparently is a display unit that includes rubber handgrips with "tactile ridges." The second, though, is for a "personal communicator" system, that "combines the functionality of a cell phone (or mobile phone), a body supported computer and a pager." Star Trek may want to claim prior art, but Xybernaut claims this is a bit different from previous wearable patents in that this version includes "detachable" parts. Who knew that by making something detachable, it was suddenly patentable? Maybe King Missile should claim    prior art   ...

    Do We Even Need Programmers Any More?    
 InternetNews is taking a look at the latest development tool releases from Sun and Microsoft that try to "dumb down" programming to the point that any old idiot can create applications and    wonders if coders are still necessary   . The obvious answer the article reaches (and, yeah, the article includes a quote from me on this point) is that  of course  we'll still need real programmers. People have been promising the "programmer-less programs" for ages, and they seem to forget that designing applications isn't like designing a webpage. There's a lot more to it than just the user interface, and it's a different mode of thought. That said, however, it does seem like there is a real opportunity to expand the space of more personalized "quick and dirty" programs to solve specific needs. If people can have tools to    build themselves specific programs    it can expand the space, not necessarily shrink it for traditional programmers.

    Have your Google people talk to my 'googol' people    
 Stunning. Someone should write a book about the amazing things people (who don't work at Google) have done in their attempts to cash in on the insane amount of greed that seems to grip people when it comes to the upcoming Google IPO. There's already been a scam of someone    selling fake pre-IPO Google shares    who convinced a number of Wall Street insiders and big company execs to shell out. Now, however, we have the descendants of the man who came up with the term "googol" (on which Google    based their name   ) claiming that    Google is unfairly profiting off of their intellectual property   . No, seriously. They haven't yet taken legal action, but are trying to persuade Google that they deserve pre-IPO shares in the company. They make it out as if this is them being  nice  - and suggesting that it's Google's  ethical obligation  to give them shares, or they may need to sue. It shouldn't be at all surprising to find out that the descendant leading this charge is a Silicon Valley "compensation specialist." She complains that she wrote the company in 1988 (I assume this is a typo, as the company was founded in 1998) and they didn't write back - which she attributes to them either being busy or  arrogant . I think it's fair to attribute this latest move by this family to  greed .  
 
 
  
'Googol,' the youngster replied.

The concept was announced in 1940, in Kasner's best-selling book, Mathematics and the Imagination. A googol, he wrote, is 10 raised to the 100th power - or the number 1 followed by a hundred zeros. In an obituary in The New York Times in 1955, Kasner was quoted explaining that a googol was 'more than the number of raindrops falling on the city in a century, or the number of grains of sand on the Coney Island beach.'

Today, though, when most people hear the term, they are likely thinking not of Kasner, but of the popular Internet search engine, Google. And that, for some, is the problem.

Relatives of Kasner are crying foul. They believe Google has gained financially at their expense. That conviction only increased with Google's recent announcement that it will go public, hoping to raise $2.7 billion in sales of its stock. If the stock price reaches $40 per share, the founders of the company and several of its employees will be worth many millions each.

Peri Fleisher of Santa Cruz, Calif., Kasner's great-niece and a compensation specialist for a Silicon Valley firm, spoke with The Sun about her great-uncle and the family's quest for compensation.


Edward Kasner died in 1955. Did you know him? "

    Googles vs. Google    
 It's funny how all the lawsuits against Google just so happen to appear right before their IPO. The website Googles.com just shot up their traffic numbers by a ridiculous amount for their stories and games for young children about an alien named Googles, by    suing Google for trademark infringement   .   
  It turns out that Googles (the alien/children folks) got a trademark for the name related to children's books and toys in 1997, pre-dating Google by about a year.   
  This wasn't a real problem until Google decided to go public... er... start offering shopping searches on their Froogle website that offered links to children's toys, games and books.   
  The folks behind Googles' say they would be happy as long as Google.com pointed to their site any time anyone searched for children's products (no, seriously). However, they're upset that Google's management hasn't found the time to sit down and discuss the claim seriously. Well, at least they appear to have a stronger claim than    the family of man who came up with the word "googol"   .

   AUSSIE KIDS - ENCOURAGED TO FART!   
 THE ABC has come under fire for wasting taxpayers' money on a new website which encourages children to "make better farts".  The Federal Government is outraged that the national broadcaster axed the popular children's show Behind The News because of a lack of funding, but managed to find money to teach kids how to break wind more effectively.   
  Respected scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has written a column for the site called Begone With The Wind, telling children that "the average fart is a wondrous event". Children are also encouraged to take part in a "Great Fart Survey", a "Great Baked Beans Fart Experiment" and to submit poetry about bodily functions.  
  "What are the farts of Australia's kids really like?" the survey asks. "Are we a nation of silent and deadlies or machine gunners? And how much do baked beans really increase your farting ability?"  
  Another section titled "celebrity farts" asks high-profile Australians to recall their fondest farting memory.......

   People tend to develop strong ties to a specific computer, even if it means waiting to use their favourite machine say researchers. A team at Pennsylvania State University in the US found that people were drawn to a PC because of their tendency to assign human attributes to machines.   
   "It is well documented how we treat computers as if they have feelings, despite the fact that we know deep down that they have been pre-programmed by humans," said Professor Shyam Sundar, co-director of the Media Effects Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University.

 Spinach power is not just for Popeye, it could work for computers too. US researchers have made electrical cells that are powered by plant proteins.  
  The biologically based solar cells, which convert light into electrical energy, should be efficient and cheap to manufacture, says co-creator Marc Baldo of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They could even be used to coat and power laptops, providing a portable source of green energy.

         I really shouldn't cross-post like this but i MUST point you to an excellent discussion topic....check out this:   
    A Question of Ethics    
  In an older post, I reflected briefly on the idea that artificial life could be given different basic motivations than biological life. Biological life essentially does whatever it can to survive and multiply. Human society is shaped by this same motivation. One could assume that any 'machine society' formed of sentient machines would be shaped by their most basic motivations.  
  Since we're the ones creating them, it seems that we could choose what those basic motivations are.  
  Let's imagine a scenario. What if sentient machines were created, with the 'hardwired' core motivation of 'making humans happy'. That is, the most basic feeling of satisfaction these machines would feel would come from making humans happy. This would be as strong a motivation in them as we are used to seeing reproduction be in other forms of life."...

Here's an interesting article that was linked from    Slashdot   . An international team of scientists has applied a genetic algorithm to network data caching, with promising results. From the article:    To tackle the challenge, Pablo Funes of US company Icosystem and Jürgen Branke and Frederik Theil of the University of Karlsruhe in Germany used "genetic algorithms", which mimic Darwinian evolution, to develop strategies for internet servers to use when caching data. Using a simulation they were able to improve download speeds over existing caching schemes.    It's a short article. If you're already familiar with how GA's work, it'll come across as very basic, but it's nice to see these technologies being applied to real world problems:    Evolution could speed net downloads

The common house mouse (scientific name Mus Musculus) is one of the most studied and well understood of mammals. It is a model organism for researching many aspects of biology, including neurobiology. Recent studies by Professor Joe Tsien, and colleagues at Princeton University, have been using the mouse to reveal the molecular basis of learning and memory. As a result of their experiments they have produced genetically modified mice which are 4 to 5 times as intelligent as normal mice."

The aim of this project at the California Institute of Technology is to use emergent computational technology to create models of brain development. The project team is a comprised of computational scientists, neuroscientists, and embryologists. Together they are using computers to analyse the results of optical and fMRI brain imaging. The long term goal is to provide an atlas of the complete anatomy and neural wiring of the brain, both in the adult and throughout childhood development. The project is split into three parts, as discussed below.

Algorithms project: 
Understanding the structure and the development of the brain requires information through a range of scales. Global anatomy is at the scale of centimetres, whilst neural connectivity is at the scale of nanometers. Neuron signalling occurs within microseconds, brain development takes months. No single imaging technique, however, can be used at all of these scales. Optical imaging, for example, is capable of high spatial and temporal resolution but is unable to view deep inside of tissues. Conversely, MR imaging can non-invasively view deep inside living tissue but has much poorer resolution. Therefore computer melding techniques must be used to combine the data from different imaging modalities into a single image. Developing the software algorithms for this melding is the job of the Algorithms project. 
As well as data-melding software, this team have also developed tools for tissue discrimination as well as hardware and software for semi-immersive visualisation of tissues. "

Posted at: October 23, 2003 05:57 PM | Comments (0) | Edit 
Researchers at the Koch lab and Dr Francis Crick of the Salk Institute believe that the time is now ripe for a scientific attack on the problem of consciousness. Their approach is to leave the philosophical questions behind and instead to concentrate on looking for what they call 'the neuronal correlate of consciousness', or 'NCC'. The NCC is thought to consist of particular neurons in the brain, and particular patterns of activity, which lead directly to consciousness. They assume that the different aspects of consciousness (pain, visual awareness, self-consciousness, etc) all employ the same basic mechanism. Thus they have chosen visual consciousness as the primary example target for study.
The working hypothesis: 
Crick and Koch maintain that in order to be aware of an object or event, the brain has to construct a multilevel interpretation of the visual scene. The levels can correspond to lines, or eyes or faces. It may be that only a small group of neurons fire during the representation of some aspect of a visual scene. This group is likely to number 100-1000 neurons for the representation of an aspect such as a face. A representation of an object or an event will usually consist of representations of many of the relevant aspects of it, and these are likely to be distributed over different parts of the visual system. How these different representations are bound together is known as the binding problem. Much neural activity is needed for the brain to construct a representation. Most of this activity is probably unconscious. As a working hypothesis they assume that only some types of specific neurons will express the NCC. It is already known that the firing of many cortical cells does not correspond t"

    An Excerpt from this excellent article....    
  Recently,     Matt Powell   &nbsp;   wrote about returning XML from webservices   , and I certainly agree with him that returning it as an opaque string is really bad. Later on,    Matevz Gacnik   &nbsp;   suggested a couple points to consider    when to choose one or the other. Matt    continued his rant    &nbsp;this time tackling at the heart of the problem: why do you need to load a full-blown DOM just to get the nice XML returned from the webservice? At this point, I felt&nbsp;I should kick in.   
    You see, one of the greatest things about having a fully OO platform is that you can easily complement what's missing by simply inheriting a couple classes, plugging your stuff in the infrastructure. So, let me state it clear and loud:  you don't have to load an XmlDocument to return well-formed XML from webservices . Let's see how this is accomplished.

  A Truely Excellent piece of work. As far as i am concerned, this is simply THE best practice for returning Data From WebServices....Read on:   
  There are many reasons why developers don't use the  XPathDocument  and  XPathNavigator  APIs and resort to  XmlDocument  instead. I outlined some of&nbsp;them with regards to querying functionality in&nbsp;my posts about&nbsp;   how to take advantage of XPath expression precompilation   , and    how to get an  XmlNodeList  from compiled expressions compilation   .   
     XPathNavigator  is a far superior way of accessing and querying data because it offers built-in support for XPath querying independently of the store, which automatically gain the feature and more importantly, because it abstracts the underlying store mechanism, which allows multiple data formats to be accessed consistently. The XML WebData team has seriously optimized the internal storage of  XPathDocument , which results in important improvents both in loading time and memory footprint, as well as general performance.&nbsp;This was possible because the underlying store is completely hidden from the developer behind the  XPathNavigator  class, therefore, even the most drastic change in internal representation does not affect current applications.    
  However, some useful features of the  XmlDocument  and  XmlReader  classes are not available. Basically, I've created an  XmlReader  facade over the  XPathNavigator  class, which allows you to work against either an streaming or a cursor API. I'll discuss how the missing features are enabled by the use of the new&nbsp; XPathNavigatorReader  class, part of the opensource    Mvp.Xml project   . ......

 Watching the Perseid Meteor Shower.      
      
  The annual Perseid meteor shower has already started, but it's going to peak on the night of August 11, with observers in dark locations seeing upwards of 60 meteors an hour. This year could be special, though, since the Earth is expected to pass through a brand new filament of material left over from Comet Swift-Tuttle when it flew past in 1862. This year's Perseids could turn into a full fledged meteor storm, but the only way to know for sure is to get out and watch. The best time will be after 11 pm, in the darkest skies you can find.  
   &nbsp; 
  The Perseid meteor shower, an annual celestial event beloved by millions of skywatchers around the world, returns to the night sky this week near the North Star and the constellation Perseus.  Sky &amp; Telescope magazine predicts that the Perseid shower will reach its peak late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, August 11-12. The rate of activity should pick up steam after midnight until the first light of dawn. North America, especially the West and Hawaii, is optimally positioned to catch the best of the shower.  An observer under a dark sky might typically see more than 60 Perseids per hour between midnight and dawn. Since the waning crescent Moon will be only three days from new at the time of shower maximum, posing minimal interference with the view, this is an opportune year for watching them.   You'll need no equipment but your eyes. The darker your sky, the better any artificial light pollution in your sky will reduce the number of meteors that are visible. But even if you live in an urban or suburban area, you have a good chance of seeing at least some meteors. Find a dark spot with a wide-open view of the sky. Bring a reclining lawn chair, insect repellent, and blankets or a sleeping bag; clear August nights can get surprisingly chilly.

  #{TIGGR} - Again NOT my work but a great topic..i kinda am a bit obsessed with this topic at the moment - taking up lots of my spare intellectual bandwidth!...  
   Present Living, part deux   
    
   
   Present Living [part un]   , Luke's "   Past, Present, and Future    (response).  
    
   
  Luke's post makes me want to speculate as to what the difference could be between two people (besides claims to being screwed up) that leads them to have [on the surface] similar present-thinking philosophies, but for one to need (?) a belief in other-worldly permanence and the other not to:  
    
   
  I do believe there are permanent things in the world, but I can not empirically prove it's existence. I believe that the Creator has existed for all time and will continue to exist long after this world has been erased from the drawing board. I have faith that when I die my soul (spirit) will continue to live on as a unique individual like I am now and that I will spend the rest of eternity in bliss.   
  
  Perhaps it is my belief in the spiritual that frees me from the need of permanence in this world...then again I could just be screwed up in the head. You decide.   
    
   
  My first thought when I read this was a laughing, "Hey, that's  cheating !"  
    
   
  But it does raise an interesting point that I didn't address in Part un--spirituality.  
    
   
  I have this idea/philosophy that because of the inherent subjectivism of existence (stay with me, I'm not heading into full-blown subjectivism...), the only way that I can know the world as well as I can is through my senses and whatever I can garner from others' perspectives. Where is this relativity? It comes primarily from the natural human limitations of our sensory organs and our brains, and is built upon by the unique differences in abilities and experiences between individuals. Combine my poor eyesight, hypersensitivity to touch, my belief system, and the intricate web of my life experience, and you get an interesting "filter" for life.  
    
   
  Now imagine the possible permutations across the six billion-ish people (?) in existence presently.  
    
   
  Whether or not there is some "absolute" reality outside of our perceptions is up for debate and is actually rather irrelevant. What I can perceive is what there is. What someone else can perceive is what they have. With "perceive" extending to opinions/faith in the supra/supernatural, since emotions, thoughts, and experiences (that whole brain thing) are a crucial part of the "filter".  
    
   
  My goal, of course, is to widen my perceptions by learning about possibilities for alternates. (Why? Because it's something that draws me in and I've learned a lot of useful things this way.) For instance, I remember one issue that was brought up in the Theory of Knowledge class I took in high school was the fact that all of our scientific detecting equipment is, by requirement, based upon our five senses--we have things to make us see farther or with more depth, to hear things in ranges our ears don't hear, and to preserve records better than our brains' memory ever can. But the idea of equipment that detects based on some type of input that we don't even have a sensory organ for boggles the mind. How could we even develop such a system, since we have no concept of any other type of input other than what our five senses affords us? How would we interpret the data? We turn infrared spectra into visible colors based on temperature--so our perceptions of infrared are in terms of temperature (touch) and [artificial] color (sight). All that's doing is intensifying our sense of touch (effectively) and translating it into something visible. Not stepping outside of our boxes in any kind of of revolutionary, new-sensory input type of way, but widening our perceptions. And in such a manner, we think we can gather more information about the world around us.  
    
   
  I would maintain that this can be done on a personal, day-to-day basis. When I listen to someone tell me something about their history, this is some event that was filtered by that person when it occured, is refiltered everytime they think about it, was refiltered again when they vocalized it, and was filtered by me upon hearing it. That's a hell of a lot of "filters", but that's what's interesting: my immediate concern is what my and the speaker's current filters are and how they developed.  
    
   
  And how in tarnation does this relate to that old "present living" idea? Because the interesting challenge in learning about people is that all I can really get is a hint of a snapshot of the other person's current state, even when discussing their history, and this current state is constantly changing. And, because [to me] this is the only way I can and do see the world,  everything  is ephemeral, and what matters is the here and now.

  Past, present, future From Lissa-Love's 'Present Living' post....  
  #{TIGGR} - Well, again i disclaim my own work here...this is not my doing: thanks to Luke over at ?Luke Says Moo!? for this addition to a previous topic hosted here...here is an alteraative view on ?Present Living?     
  I thought I'd give a little follow up because she keeps harassing me about it...and because it is something to think about on occasion. 
 Anyway, I classifymyself as someone who lives in the present. I don't dwell on the past or the future. I learn from my experiences and relish history when I have a chance to take it in. I plan for the future in some ways, but I don't plan for what my life will really be like. 
 Normally I move with the flow and do what needs to be done as the tide of the day brings changes with each ebb and flow. I know that I have little to no control over the actions of those around me and throughout the world, so I do my best to work with what I'm presented and go on from there.  
 Which brings me to thoughts on permanence. Lissa suggests that people living in the past and future deem that "for anything to have meaning, to be important, it must have longevity and be 'permanent'." Which seems like a good conclusion considering the present gives very little permanence to anything.  
 "The only thing that stays the same is everything changes." (Tracy Lawrence, "Time Marches On") 
 To me there is no permanence in this corporeal world because nothing can stay the same. Throughout human history, recorded or otherwise, everything has changed. Languages, cultures, war, kings, lands exchange owners, and even the Earth changes shape given enough time. Even the heavens mark the change in the passing of time. Stars burn out, new stars are formed, comets zip by, and space itself continues to change with each passing moment. 
 For that matter, neither the Earth nor the heavens mark any life except perhaps the very, very few that become part of ancient myths and modern histories. Even then, what we pervceive as permanent will eventually be washed away, like a sand castle on the beach, because time will wear away all meaning and the future generations will be left to wonder and speculate just as we do with the Aztecs, Mayans, Egytians, Greeks, Romans, the Aryan peoples, various African peoples I don't even know the names of, and I'm sure you get the point by now. Given enough time nothing that you or I understand as being permanent will be permanent. 
 Perhaps my concept of the future is too broad and those that live in the past and future only live in a narrow band of the past and future...perhaps just defining their present to be a few hundred years before and after their lifetime.  
 Anyway, I do believe there are permanent things in the world, but I can not empirically prove it's existence. I believe that the Creator has existed for all time and will continue to exist long after this world has been erased from the drawing board. I have faith that when I die my soul (spirit) will continue to live on as a unique individual like I am now and that I will spend the rest of eternity in bliss. 
 Perhaps it is my belief in the spiritual that frees me from the need of permanence in this world...then again I could just be screwed up in the head. You decide. 
 Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.  - Eckhart Tolle

NASA Successfully Deploys Two Solar Sail Systems     
     NASA  -- NASA engineers and their industry partners have successfully deployed two solar sails ? each nearly 33 feet in length along one side ? reaching a critical milestone in the development of a unique propulsion technology that could enable future deep space missions.     
  
  Solar sail propulsion uses the Sun's energy to travel through space, much the way wind pushes sailboats across water. The technology bounces a stream of solar energy particles called photons off giant, reflective sails made of lightweight material 40 to 100 times thinner than a piece of writing paper.   
    
  The continuous pressure provides sufficient thrust to perform maneuvers, such as hovering at a point in space and rotating the space vehicle's plane of orbit, which would require too much propellant for conventional rocket systems. Because the Sun provides the necessary propulsive energy, solar sails also require no onboard propellant, thus reducing payload mass.

Antenna on the Cheap (er, Chip)

Of course, there are problems with    approaching infinity   , but it's still fun to try!)  
  The work that    Andrew Clapp    and others have done is helping to demystify the ancient black magick of Resonance (i.e. antenna building). And so, over last weekend, some friends and I decided to give it a go for ourselves.

And as the operator, it is  YOUR RESPONSIBILITY  to not take the word of some raving lunatic on the web with funny colored hair, and find things out for yourself. Your mileage will vary. I'm probably lying. You have been warned.

   Monkey Learns to Walk Upright    
  JERUSALEM (AP) ? A young monkey at an Israeli zoo has started walking on its hind legs only ? aping humans ? after a near death experience, the zoo's veterinarian said Wednesday.  
  Natasha, a 5-year-old  black macaque  (   search   ) at the Safari Park near Tel Aviv, began walking exclusively on her hind legs after a stomach ailment nearly killed her, zookeepers said.  
  Monkeys usually alternate between upright movement and walking on all fours. A picture in the Maariv daily on Wednesday showed Natasha standing ramrod straight like a human. The picture was labeled humorously, "The Missing Link?"  
  Two weeks ago, Natasha and three other monkeys were diagnosed with severe stomach flu. At the zoo clinic, she slipped into critical condition, said Igal Horowitz, the veterinarian.  
  "I was sure that she was going to die," he said. "She could hardly breathe and her heart was not functioning properly."  
  After intensive treatment, Natasha's condition stabilized. When she was released from the clinic, Natasha began walking upright.  
  "I've never seen or heard of this before," said Horowitz. One possible explanation is brain damage from the illness, he said.  
  Otherwise, Horowitz said, Natasha's behavior has returned to normal.

  Jim Cara thought it would be really funny to get a license plate reading "NOTAG" for his motorcycle.       
  That's until the plate came in the mail with over 200 unpaid parking tickets, reports the News-Journal of Wilmington, Del.  
  "All the traffic tickets say: 'Notice of violation. License number: no tag,'" Cara, of nearby Elsmere, Del., said.  
  John Rago, spokesman for the Wilmington mayor's office, explained that the city and state computer systems had finally found what they'd been looking for ? a match for "No Tag" and an address to send the tickets to.  
  "I messed up the system so bad," Cara laughed. "I wonder if they can put me in jail or something."  
  Kelly Pitts, spokeswoman for the state Department of Transportation, said Wilmington was the only jurisdiction using the specific computer code generating the tickets.  
  Cara, 43, said he's been pulling pranks his entire life, but that this time, "the cleanup is going to be worse than the joke."  
  There was no indication Cara would be held liable for the violations.  
  Vanity-plate applications are screened for vulgar and distasteful phrases, Pitts explained, but "NOTAG" was neither. She suggested Cara change the number.  
  He disagreed.  
  "I want to keep it," he told the newspaper. "I think it's awesome."

 A thousand cruise-ship passengers got the fright of their lives when a prankster took over the vessel's public-address system and told them to "abandon ship."      
  The Miracle, a  Carnival Cruise Lines  (   search   ) vessel, was only hours away from arriving in New York last Saturday after a week-long Bahamas jaunt, reports the New York Daily News.  
  Suddenly, at 3:45 a.m., came the "abandon ship" announcement, jolting passengers out of bed.  
  "People freaked out," Chris Vig, 36, of New Hyde Park, N.Y., told the Daily News. "It was absolute panic."  
  Thinking terrorists had taken over the ship, hundreds of formerly relaxed vacationers in their pajamas gathered on the third deck, waiting for further announcements.  
  Ten minutes later, according to Vig, another voice came over the PA, telling passengers everything was fine.

   Watching Them Watching Us   
    The idea of    watching back    those who are watching us is not new. Every time it's brought up, someone points to David Brin's     The Transparent Society    . Now, Brin has written up a long (and somewhat rambling) piece for Salon that points out, whether we like it or not,    technology is forcing everyone to be more open   . It's not a question of whether the technology is good or bad, but how it's used. His suggestion is that it's time to embrace the technology of surveillance (and sousveillance) in order to make sure that it's used properly. Simply trying to stop the rise of cameras, RFIDs and closely connected databases is doomed to fail. And, even worse, by fighting against it, many privacy advocates are making sure that these things are set up so only "they" (governments, corporations, someone who isn't you) have access -- leaving out any accountability. In a world where people are freaking out over camera phones, RFIDs and internet tapping, it's certainly an interesting read. Brin points out that all of these technologies have benefits when used properly, and even the negatives can be dealt with, if people really come up with ways to embrace the technology, rather than just deny its existence altogether.

    #{TIGGR} - Regular readers will know my opinion by now but here it is again....DRM/IPO/IPRM IS KILLING CREATIVITY!    
   Congrats Hollywood: You Put A Useful Software Company Out Of Business   
  Hollywood must be thrilled. We've been following the    case of 321 Software    for nearly two years, and that story is now over. 321 made software that was designed to make backing up your DVDs easier. Fair use laws are clear that people are allowed to make personal backup copies of digital media for themselves, mainly if a product breaks or has problems. 321 was careful to make sure the product was really only useful for that purpose, and that it wasn't a very good tool for anyone who wanted to make many copies of a DVD. The company even put out a    bounty    if anyone could find someone who was pirating DVDs with their software. Still, the movie industry attacked, and claimed that    the software would harm "consumer choice and film making"    without giving any evidence how that might happen. Eventually, Hollywood's lawyers prevailed, and 321 was told to    stop selling their software   . The company kept trying to fight the ruling, but without being able to sell software it's tough to do much, and today    the company officially shut down   . While Jack Valenti was telling us that if this software was allowed to exist we'd have less consumer choice, it appears that that's the case now, since we can no longer buy this software and back up our DVDs.

  Patents Have Become The Nuclear Stockpiling Of The Software Industry   
  Marten Mickos, CEO of mySQL, has written a piece over at Always-On, explaining (accurately) that the software patent game these days is      the equivalent of nuclear stockpiling   . You build up as many patents as you can, because you know the competition is, too, and you'll need them to fight off any patent battle. It doesn't need to be this way. In fact, it shouldn't be this way, because all it's doing is slowing down innovation and diverting money away from development to lawyers. Mickos uses the database industry as an example. In the days before software patents, plenty of people took the relational database ideas of Edgar Codd (totally random aside: I had a database professor in college who had the bumper sticker: "Codd is God" in honor of Mr. Codd) and built up a thriving industry, including the standardization of SQL, on which the entire industry is based. While he doesn't say it specifically, the clear implication is that in a world of software patents, that situation wouldn't have existed. Letting everyone build their own implementations based on the idea of relational databases and the standards of SQL allowed a thriving, competitive industry to develop. Copyright laws protect the code. However, when we patent ideas, the first person to come up with the "idea" of a relational database could have patented it -- and simply stopped the competition from happening without coughing up license fees to IBM. As we've said before,    innovation is more important than invention   . By allowing the inventor to patent an entire concept, it kills the ability to innovate, harming the entire economy.

   #{TIGGR} -Ahhh...it reminds me of MY mis-spent youth...lets go blow some stuff up!   
  Teens lucky with homemade cannon   
  Sarpsborg police were puzzled by a rash of worried calls asking why there had been an deafening bang from the old fortress area. An quick investigation revealed an potentially fatal experiment by three 15-year-old boys was the reason, newspaper Sarpsborg Arbeiderblad reports.  
 
  The trio of bored teens had decided to try building a homemade cannon. They used a meter-long iron pipe and bought a steel boccia ball to use as a projectile. The final ingredients were a small amount of gunpowder scraped out of some old fireworks and a fuse.  
  The three boys set up their cannon at an old defense building and pointed it at a wooden target they made about 30 meters (98 feet) away.  
  "They were lucky they aimed towards terrain. The ball hit the target they set up 30 yards away and the massive steel ball continued into a thicket before richocheting off the mountain. From there it was tossed nearly 300 meters over Grekerdalen, accompanied by an enormous bang. This despite a moderate amount of gunpowder," police inspector Knoff Nss told the newspaper.  
  "In retrospect they see how lucky they have been and are obviously overjoyed that the heavy steel ball didn't hurt anyone. But they could have injured themselves. If they had used the wrong kind of powder it wouldn't have been a cannon, it would have been a splinter bomb," Nss said, and warned others not to try similar stunts.

     MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will begin charging the United States for delivering astronauts and cargo to the international space station starting next year, the head of the Federal Space Agency said Wednesday.      
  
  Although Russia and the United States agreed to split the costs of sending men and material to the space station, only Russian spacecraft have been used since last year's space shuttle disaster; space officials say that by carrying the sole burden, Russia has fulfilled its end of the agreement.  
    
  "If the Americans want to fly Soyuz (spacecraft) in 2005, they will have to compensate us&nbsp;the costs," space agency head Anatoly Perminov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.  
    
  NASA aims to resume shuttle flights next spring, but efforts to enhance their safety may cause delays.  
    
  The European Space Agency is also working on a cargo ship to supplement the U.S. and Russian vessels that fly to the space station.

   Studies at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research reveal: solar activity affects the climate but plays only a minor role in the current global warming.   
  
       
      Extreme ultraviolet image of a solar flare blasting from the sun at millions of miles per hour.     
     Max Planck Society  -- Since the middle of the last century, the Sun is in a phase of unusually high activity, as indicated by frequent occurrences of sunspots, gas eruptions, and radiation storms.     
    
  Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Katlenburg-Lindau (Germany) and at the University of Oulu (Finland) have come to this conclusion after they have succeeded in reconstructing the solar activity based on the sunspot frequency since 850 AD. To this end, they have combined historical sunspot records with measurements of the frequency of radioactive isotopes in ice cores from Greenland and the Antarctic.   
    
  As the scientists have reported in the renowned scientific journal, Physical Review Letters, since 1940 the mean sunspot number is higher than it has ever been in the last thousand years and two and a half times higher than the long term average. The temporal variation in the solar activity displays a similarity to that of the mean temperature of the Earth.   
    
  These scientific results therefore bring the influence of the Sun on the terrestrial climate, and in particular its contribution to the global warming of the 20th century, into the forefront of current interest. However, researchers at the MPS have shown that the Sun can be responsible for, at most, only a small part of the warming over the last 20-30 years.

    #{TIGGR} - Information we should ALL read....    
  Were the Madrid bombings part of a new, far-reaching jihad being plotted on the Internet?   
  For much of Spain?s modern history, the organization that has defined its experience with terror is  ETA , which stands for Euzkadi Ta Azkatasuna (Basque Homeland and Liberty).  ETA , which was founded in 1959, has a clear political goal: it wants to set up a separate nation, comprising the Basque provinces, in northern Spain, and parts of southern France. Although  ETA  has killed some eight hundred people, it has developed a reputation for targeting, almost exclusively, politicians, security officials, and journalists. Over the years, the terrorists and the Spanish police have come to a rough understanding about the rules of engagement. ?They don?t commit attacks on the working class, and they always call us before an explosion, telling us where the bomb is situated,? an intelligence official in the Spanish National Police told me recently in Madrid. ?If they place a bomb in a backpack on a train, there will be a cassette tape saying, ?This bag is going to explode. Please leave the train.?? And so on March 11th, when the first reports arrived of mass casualties resulting from explosions on commuter trains, Spanish intelligence officials assumed that  ETA  had made an appalling mistake.   
  At 7:37  A.M. , as a train was about to enter Madrid?s Atocha station, three bombs blasted open the steel cars, sending body parts through the windows of nearby apartments. The station is in Madrid?s center, a few blocks from the Prado Museum. Within seconds, four bombs exploded on another train, five hundred and fifty yards from the station. The bombs killed nearly a hundred people. Had the explosions occurred when the trains were inside the station, the fatalities might have tallied in the thousands; a quarter of a million people pass through Atocha every workday. The trains at that hour were filled with students and young office workers who live in public housing and in modest apartment complexes east of the city. Many were immigrants, who had been drawn by the Spanish economic boom.   
  As emergency crews rushed to the scene, two more bombs demolished a train at the El Pozo del To Raimundo station, three miles away. By then, Jos Mara Aznar, the Prime Minister, had learned of the attacks, which were taking place at the end of an uneventful political campaign. The conservative Popular Party, which Aznar headed, was leading the Socialists by four and a half points in the polls, despite the overwhelming opposition of the Spanish population to the country?s participation in the war in Iraq. It was Thursday morning; the election would take place on Sunday.  
  At seven-forty-two, one minute after the El Pozo bomb, a final bomb went off, on a train at the suburban Santa Eugenia station. Emergency workers arrived to find mangled bodies littering the tracks. The Spanish had never seen anything like this?the worst  ETA  atrocity, in 1987, killed twenty-one shoppers in a Barcelona grocery store. At Santa Eugenia, there were so many wounded that rescue crews ripped up the benches in the waiting area to use as stretchers. In all, there were a hundred and ninety-one fatalities and sixteen hundred injuries. It was the most devastating act of terrorism in European history, except for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

   Database Change Management: An Automated Approach   
  &nbsp;In this first article of a 4 part series, Darren Fuller discusses the need for database change management and problems with current approaches. Future articles in the series will examine an automated methodology, the requirements to implement such an approach and describe the benefits that can be realised.  
  Introduction  
  Most approaches to database change management involve tedious, manual and costly processes that are error prone.&nbsp; In many cases there is no version control of the objects that reside within the database.&nbsp;   
  The result?&nbsp; Database chaos.  
  Typically, a database development project will suffer problems such as overwritten changes, code that won?t compile, lost data and confusion over what has been applied to which database.&nbsp; Release into production becomes a chaotic and costly phase, with everybody ?fire-fighting? and in ?panic mode?.  
  It is a fact that database systems are becoming more complex with ever-increasing demands.&nbsp; Businesses must continually innovate and accept challenges.&nbsp; IT departments cannot afford to complacently use processes simply because it?s ?always been done this way? or is the prevalent paradigm....

   #{TIGGR}- Well, it's not my work (thankyou to      Lissa      at at ?A Nerd's Haven?) but it certainly got me thinking....WHERE DO YOU LIVE!?   
   Present Living   
    
   
  Conversations with Jenn and the Cool CS Guy have me thinking about where I live in terms of time--past, present, future, or some combination of the three.  
    
   
  There are people that live almost exclusively in the past and future--for anything to have meaning, to be important, it must have longevity and be "permanent". The idea of death as simply an end to existence is enough to inspire fear, because the ultimate desire is to be able to exist in some permanent, unchanging state forever. All plans for the future (including afterlife thoughts) revolve around creating a stable base or on proving that one's existence is not "merely" a brief blink in the history of the world.  
    
   
  Then there are people that live exclusively in the present. They let go of past events, make very tenuous plans for the future, and maintain a good solid core of inner strength that enables them to ride out the ever-changing present. Routines are not comforting, permanence is a farce, and death may very well simply be the end of one's existence--and this is okay.  
    
   
  I am becoming an increasingly present-liver. I find myself unable to hold grudges against my father or against people that I feel have wronged me. I learn from the past, of course, and I am insatiably curious about the past, but only so far as it develops into the present, be it language, people, or world history. The idea of something being permanent brings no comfort to me and, quite frankly, doesn't seem possible. I don't believe it's possible for me to have regrets--everything I am doing or have done is something I've chosen to do, and I accept the consequences of those choices. Whether I might have been happier doing something else or something more or being something else means absolutely  nothing --this is me, now, and this is what I live with.  
    
   
  I have no plans for the future. I have no career in mind, much less a particular path leading to retirement. I may or may not graduate from Rose in three years. I may or may not keep my major or add various minors to reflect my interests. I refuse to box myself in in that manner, and I know it would serve absolutely no purpose--the future will come and I will have to deal with it as I do with anything else: with the skills and learning at my disposal, and nothing else. I will do what keeps me thinking and aware and happy, whatever that may be.  
    
   
  Running has taught me that routines are non-existent. Every morning, I leave the house at a slightly different time, in a slightly different mood, with my shoes laces slightly looser or tighter than the day before. My runs change every day. Do I walk 200 m to give my aching shoulder a break? Does this still "count" as running in one shot? Am I adhering to my training schedule? I am okay with this. I like this. Every day I have to adapt to new challenges in something as simple as a two- or three-mile run. It's a wave I enjoy riding.  
    
   
  Social interactions this past year have taught me the past is to be learned from and let go. My long-time stress over my father is useless and means nothing to me or him. My anger at my sister's existence was me grasping for what my life was five years ago, not what it is today. My life five years ago was just that--five years ago,  not  today,  not  now. Friendships are not something to be clung to until I wring them dry; I learn voraciously in the time we have and enjoy the company, then I move on. My disagreements with various people are not cause for flinging bitter vitriols or eye-rolling for months. Learn, disagree, and move on.  
    
   
  My blog is a series of snaphsots of my life that I maintain simply because I enjoy writing, even so informally.  I  don't read my archives, and have no interest in doing so. Anyone who does is gathering only an album of these snapshots that is not particularly indicative of my present state. Because I never stop thinking about a topic just because I post about it, my thoughts on issues are ever-changing.  
    
   
  So where do I live? The present, with a hint of the past and the lightest dash of the future. For now.

How Microsoft Uses Reflection   
 
 
 
     I          n this fourth installment of .NET Matters, I'm taking a breather from the Q&amp;A format. Instead, this month I bring you stories from the trenches; developers in product groups within Microsoft describe how they use .NET technologies to get their jobs done and develop their products. This month, Steve Lamb, a lead software design engineer on the Xbox team, and Adi Oltean, a software design engineer from the core file services team, discuss ways they've used reflection (System.Reflection and System.Reflection.Emit) in their particular products.

 The Programmers' Stone  
  Hi, and welcome to The Programmers' Stone. The purpose of this site is to recapture, explore and celebrate the Art of Computer Programming. By so doing we hope to help the reader either become a better programmer, understand what less experienced programmers are struggling with, or communicate more effectively with other experienced programmers.  
  We know from work with individuals that by doing this we put the fun back into the work and greatly extend the boundaries of the possible, so building much smarter and stronger systems.  
  The present structure is planned around an eight day course, delivered two days a week for four weeks. Each chapter corresponds to the course notes for one day's material. The eighth day should be free discussion, so no prepared notes, meaning that there are seven chapters. We've deliberately made each chapter a single HTML page because it makes it much easier to print the text. Sorry there are no internal anchors yet, there are big headings, so use your slider!

        Conversational Terrorism  
   
 
  All of the techniques listed in this document have actually been witnessed, told to us by someone else, or dreamed up. They are described in first person for clarity of motive.  
  The intent of detailing and naming these insidious tactics is so that the reader may AVOID USING THEM, to quickly recognize if someone else is using them, and for fun. There is much humor in the way people (consciously or unconsciously) conversationally cheat.  
  It is hoped that exposing these tactics will help muzzle the growing abuse in our conversational landscape. Give copies to both perpetrators and victims (only NOT for profit use).  
  The examples are overblown in an attempt to be both clear and funny. Use your imagination to think of how you (perish the thought) and others have used these techniques in the past.  
  They have been grouped by major category, with the best (worst!) saved for last.  
  First, we have the     Ad Hominem Variants     where you attack the person as a way to avoid truth, science, or logic which might otherwise prove you wrong. Next are the     Sleight of Mind Fallacies    , which act as "mental magic" to make sure the unwanted subject disappears. Then, we move on to     Delay Tactics    , which are subtle means to buy time when put on the spot. Then, the ever popular     Question as Opportunity     ploys, where any question can be deftly averted. Finally, we have the     Cheap Shot Tactics and Irritants    , which are basically "below the belt" punches.

John  has submitted this somewhat disturbing, if not at all surprising, "anonymous insider's account" of a software company that is      ramping up their patent efforts   , after another company beat them in a lawsuit over patents, and the company began to realize just how valuable patents were in that sense -- if not actually for the purpose of innovation. The clear point is that patents do little to help innovation, often do quite a bit to harm innovation, but  do  keep the lawyers quite happy. Software engineers are told to come up with just about anything that might possibly be patentable, and the engineer in question does so -- coming up with nearly 20 patents in a matter of days. The engineer admits that all would be pretty obvious to any "competent worker in our field," but all were gleefully accepted by the lawyers. The engineer points out that these patents alone likely created over a $1 million worth of legal expenses -- money that is not being spent on actual research and development any more. Despite the fact that the "any competent worker" point should make these patents completely invalid the lawyers  actively  point out that the patent examiners aren't smart enough to know any better: "Look, if the examiners were any good they'd be in industry, so you don't have too much to worry about." Meanwhile, the engineer notes that all of the innovation in the industry seems to be coming from areas where there are no patents. It is just an anecdotal story, but, it's one that seems to be getting repeated an awful lot in the software industry. If the entire point of the patent system is to promote innovation, and time and time against the opposite has been shown to be true, why isn't anyone reforming the patent system (and, even worse, why are other countries making their patent systems more like ours)?

        "A recently discovered diary may give insight into a very important person in Tasmanian history. John Lee Archer was born in Ireland in 1791 but is best known for his work in Tasmania between 1827 and 1852.  
  If you have been to Parliament House in Hobart, driven over the Ross Bridge or seen the tower of  Saint John's Church in Launceston then you will be familiar with his work.  
  As Colonial Architect and Engineer in Van Diemen's Land at that time,  he served under two Governors, Arthur and Franklin.  
  John Lee Archer's Great Great Grand-daughter, Anne Lee Archer joined  ABC Northern Tasmania's Drive Presenter Elaine Harris to tell her about the find.  
  Anne told Elaine that she had become interested in researching her family and read  through notes that her mother had collected over 20 years. She then started contacting different relatives and found that one member of the family had the diary.   
  It covers 1836 - 1837 which according to Anne Lee Archer was a key period in Tasmania's history.   
  She said the diary is quite brief and gives insight into the life of a very busy and reserved man.  
  Having transcribed and copied the diary for the local history room Anne now has to  return it to its owner which won't be an easy thing to do.  
  'Just to hold it in my hands for the first time was fantastic' she said."

       urlLink Microsoft may use patent law to hammer Linux : "Microsoft may use patent law to hammer Linux 

Justice: You've heard of Her

By INQUIRER staff: Monday 02 August 2004, 09:18
 A STUDY by a firm offering insurance against litigation will claim this week that a total of 283 software patents could put Linux users at risk of being sued.
And of those patents, Microsoft owns 27, claims Open Source Risk Management in a report on its web site.
While around a third of the patents belong to Linux-friendly vendors, and 27 by the Vole, the rest belong to companies who might see the chance of a quick buck through big Linux users.
The report reminds us that HP suits said in 2002 that the Vole 'intends to sue companies shipping Open Source products that potentially violate their patents'.
The firm said that users and developers may be able to resist such threats by attempting to reform the patent system, helping to build a database of prior art, designing around patents and - you knew this was going to come, didn't you - get patent infringement defence insurance.
The firm's lawyer, who is also a lawyer to the Free Software Foundation, said of the 283 patents: 'I have serious doubts that any of them contain valid claims covering technology critical to Linux, [but] the high costs of patent litigation would make proving that in court a severe burden for some and, unfortunately, an impossibility for others'.
It's an open secret that large IT companies, and in fact multinationals generally, use patent law as a marketing weapon against potential opposition. The threat of litigation and litigation itself can tie smaller companies up for years. ? "

       urlLink Linux - head in the sand? : "Linux - head in the sand? 
As a follow on from the previous c|net posting - Don Newman points out that Open Source Risk Management isn't releasing the list of potential patent infringements, doing so would put linux in the wrong, ignorance is bliss (apparently)... so what does this mean for linux customers? - If you build a device based on Linux and are not aware of the list of patents you are infringing that doesn't make things right, does it? - for example, in UK law theft is described (in 'points to prove') as 'to dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive', if all portions of this are met then you have broken the law whether you know it or not - doesn't this also apply to software patents?, just because you didn't know you were breaking a patent doesn't make it right, surely...
So who's going to get hit with this, the customer using a Linux based device, the distributor, developers? - looks like a bit of a minefield to me...
Caveat Emptor!"

        The multiverse theory has spawned another - that our universe is a simulation, writes Paul Davies.   
  If you've ever thought life was actually a dream, take comfort. Some pretty distinguished scientists may agree with you. Philosophers have long questioned whether there is in fact a real world out there, or whether "reality" is just a figment of our imagination.   
  Then along came the quantum physicists, who unveiled an Alice-in-Wonderland realm of atomic uncertainty, where particles can be waves and solid objects dissolve away into ghostly patterns of quantum energy.   
  Now cosmologists have got in on the act, suggesting that what we perceive as the universe might in fact be nothing more than a gigantic simulation

    Code Generation in the .NET Framework Using XML Schema       
  Automatic code generation, be it data access layers, business entity classes, or even user interfaces, can greatly increase developer productivity. This process of generation can be based on a number of inputs, such as a database, an arbitrary XML file, a UML diagram, etc. Microsoft Visual Studio .NET comes with built-in support for code generation from W3C XML Schema files (XSD) in two forms: typed datasets, and custom classes for use with  XmlSerializer .   
  XSD files describe the content that is allowed in an XML document in order to be considered valid according to the document. The need to handle the data, which will ultimately be serialized as XML for consumption, in a type-safe manner led to various approaches to converting the XSD into classes. Recall that XSD was NOT created as a means to describe objects and their relationships. A better format already exists for that, UML, and it's widely used to model applications and to generate code from it. There are, therefore, some (expected) mismatches between .NET and its object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and those of XSD. Keep this in mind when you walk the path of XSD -&gt; classes mapping.  
  That said, the CLR type system can be seen as a subset of XSD: it supports features that can't be mapped to regular OO concepts. If you're using XSD only to model your classes as opposed to modeling your documents, therefore, you will probably find almost no conflicts.  
  During the rest of this article, we will discuss the approach of typed datasets, how the custom classes generated by the xsd.exe tool make for a better solution, and how to extend and customize the output of XSD -&gt; Classes generation.  
  A basic understanding of CodeDom is required in order to get the most out this article.

       urlLink Signs on the Sand: XML Bestiary: IndexingXPathNavigator : "XML Bestiary: IndexingXPathNavigator
Here I go again with another experimental creature from my XML Bestiary: IndexingXPathNavigator. This one was inspired by Mark Fussell's 'Indexing XML, XML ids and a better GetElementByID method on the XmlDocument class'. I've been experimenting with Mark's extended XmlDocument, played a bit with XPathDocument and 'idkey()' extension function Mark was talking about. Finally I came to a conclusion that 1)XPath is the way to go (that' not the first time I say it, right? :) and thus what should be extended is XPathNavigator; 2)no need to reinvent the wheel as XSLT's keys is proved excellent stuff. 
That is what IndexingXPathNavigator is - XPathNavigator, augmented with XSLT keys functionality: it supports declaring keys, lazy or eager indexing and retriving indexed nodes via key() function all as per familiar and proved XSLT semantics."

       urlLink Subset document loading and transformation with XPathNavigatorReader : "Subset document loading and transformation with XPathNavigatorReader 
Thanks to Tom Smalley who pointed it, I fixed a bug that prevented the XPathNavigatorReader from being used for loading a new XmlDocument or XPathDocument. This feature is very useful if you have to apply a transformation to a subset of a document. For this purpose, the MSDN documentation suggests using XmlDocument both for the entire document loading as well as the subset, which is the most inefficient way of performing transformations in .NET."

       urlLink How fast is XmlSerializer? : "How fast is XmlSerializer? 
Have you ever wondered how does the XmlSerializer really works? Well, it creates a temporary assembly that is built by reflecting the type you pass to the constructor. Wait! Don't panic because of the 'reflecting' word! 
It does so only once per type, and it builds an extremely efficient pair of Reader/Writer classes that will handle serialization/ deserialization during the life of the AppDomain. 
These classes inherit the public XmlSerializationReader and XmlSerializationWriter classes in the System.Xml.Serialization namespace. If you want to take a look at the generated code, add the following setting to the application configuration file (web.config for a web application): 
 
   
     
   
 


Now the serializer won't delete the temporary files generated in the process. For a web application, the files will be located in C:\Documents and Settings\[YourMachineName]\ASPNET\Local Settings\Temp, otherwise, they will be located in your current user Local Settings\Temp folder.
You will see code that is exactly what you would have to do if you wanted to efficiently load Xml in .NET: use nested while/if as you read, use XmlReader methods to move down the stream, etc. All the ugly code is there to make it really fast. 
Special thanks to Chris Sells for his XmlSerializerCompiler utility."

   Strongly-typed, event-rising, design-time generated custom XmlSerializers    
  Summary  
  There are a couple known issues with the XmlSerializer:  
 
  First-time use is painfully slow, because of the temporary assembly generation and compilation.  
  If you want to do something else other than straight serialization, there's no easy way of customizing it.   
  Whidbey will bring a solution to the first, in the form of the "sgen" tool, which will generate at design-time the serialization assembly. I still haven't looked at the solutions it offers for the second issue.  
  So, are you condemned to waiting 'till Whidbey? Are you condemned to either choose between the straightforward-but-almost-impossible-to-customize XmlSerializer approach and endless lines of XmlReader/XmlDocument/XPath code to do almost the same yet generally&nbsp;with less performance just to gain the flexibility you need? Well, I turns out that I am a firmly believer on automating boring and repetitive tasks, so I'm not happy at all with people choosing the later, because I believe it leads to hard to maintain, inflexible, and really ugly code. You waste so much effort that would be better put to work on creative stuff, and making your app great. And performance is always a big issue, at least in my view.  
  This article explains how to achieve design-time XmlSerializer generation, how it's customized to allow for the stuff you always thought impossible, such as getting events for each kind of object being deserialized.

      British scientists are racing to set up a modern "Noah's Ark" to save endangered animals. The plan, dubbed the Frozen Ark, is actually a gene bank to preserve the biological details of species. It will hold samples of DNA and tissue at minus 80 Celsius, so as to save their genetic material for ever and give scientists an otherwise lost opportunity to study them. Over 10,000 species of animals are likely to vanish over the next 30 years due to climate change and habitat destruction. Of these, some 33 species are already extinct in the wild, and nearly 1,000 are deemed to be critically endangered.
