      whoa...andy and i went to universal studios yesterday to  buy a day and get the year free  thing.  so, after that, we just went over to walk around at city walk.  we went into this one store and saw a whole mess of pez dispensers that were cute.  andy and i were going to pick a few up for $2.50 but then we changed our minds at the last minute!  the thing is that we ended up going to this other store with pez and it was a dollar cheaper!  so, basically, i guess we just started our collection!  kinda crazy!

      wow...it's been a long time since i've blogged.  i'm just not that dedicated anymore!  anyway, lately i've been busy helping out with my brother's wedding.  so much planning is involved...TOO MUCH driving is involved...when it's not really needed.  one time i drove to carson to work on the wedding and what happened?  the person i was supposed to meet with decided not to come for some odd reason!  come on now...be realistic...people have their own lives too you know!  hehe...i know how things can get but seriously, i'm getting sorta worn out with the wedding.  i'm just glad that it's just around the corner...august 10, 2002.    going through this wedding makes me wonder if all the work is worth it.  i have these thoughts and i think that i don't want to have a big wedding anymore.  i used to want everything...the fairy tale...but this has totally turned me off.  i could just be "all talk" but i really don't know.  i already told my mom that either i don't want to get married or i'll just get married in vegas.  she seemed sorta disappointed...she wants me to have what i've always dreamed of...a beautiful wedding.  i just don't know right now.  honestly, i think i'm just having these thoughts because of all the stress (and all the driving...and "all-the-stopping-by-just-cuz-you're-on-the-way").  don't you just want to drive home from work without making any stops?  hehe...i seem bitter but i'm not.  i'm just trying to get this all out of me.    now that the wedding is approaching, i'm getting a little nervous.  when i found out that my cousin from chicago was coming on july 25 (or something like that), i already got teary-eyed.  i guess it's because i'm realizing that "the day" is coming so soon.  i asked andy a few times if he thinks that i'm gonna cry during the wedding day.  he said "oh YEAH...100%!"  i would ask him not only once but a few times cuz i really don't wanna cry.  i'm just trying to psyche myself out.  i don't know if it'll work but it's worth a try.  i have a feeling that after seeing their beautiful wedding (hopefully it'll be all that they've been wanting and dreaming of), i will eventually want my dream wedding!  we'll see...............  i haven't blogged for so long!  andy and i threw both rod and mel a wedding shower on the 20th of july.    grace (mel's cousin) and i tried our hardest to throw a bachelorette party at the last minute.  grace did the research on strippers and i made the call.  we wanted the whole entourage to be involved and invite a few more of mel's friends and cousins.  however, it didn't work out that way.  the entourage was supposed to split the cost but it was so hard to get a hold of everyone.  it was understandable esp. since it was a last minute thing.  anyway, grace and i barely got to talk to anyone personally.  i basically left messages on everyone's machine!  the only day that we could do it was august 2nd.  we were sorta expecting 15-20 people but there was only a total of  SEVEN  people.  7...and 2 of the girls were my friends...grace and jem!  oh well.    it was funny though.  we heard probably a total of 4 door bells ringing but it was the tv.  and everytime we heard it, we all got nervous!  i was with grace and jem outside and the "real" doorbell rang.  grace was smoking and she didn't know where to kill her cigarette.  she ended up killing it on some plastic thing.  we ran inside and grace decided to spray some perfume on!  they were scrambling looking for their dollar bills.  finally, we saw the stripper and he was wearing a cop uniform.  it was such an interesting night!  i didn't expect the stripper to get as wild as he did.  he had us play some games (basically so that he can get his dollar bills).  the girls had to put dollar bills on the stripper and i had to take them back out with my mouth.  i was quite a nervous girl but i tried!  i think i ended up getting only $2 cuz the rest of the money was too close to his thingy! :)  anyway, that night was interesting and fun.  i was just sorta disappointed that there wasn't a lot of people that showed up...and one of the ones that said that they were coming decided to not come!  oh well.  it was still an experience.  i just can't wait till one of my friends get married (so i can go to another one of these bachelorette parties)!  everyone probably left at around 11pm.  i was bored after everyone left that i decided to take a drive out by myself.  i called andy to ask him to come home already but he was out with his friends.  i ended up calling my friend don in carson and we just talked on the phone for a bit.  after that, i just went back home and went to sleep.  the following day (august 3), they had an entourage get-together.  we had lunch at claim jumpers.  we ordered so much dessert...!  everyone got so tired and sleepy! :)  my brother and melani gave all the bridesmaids (maid-of-honor) and groomsmen (best man) some gifts!  what did they get me?  well, first i got the "blue box" in a "blue bag."  can you guess what it is?  they got me a sterling silver bracelet from tiffany & co.  i was so surprised and happy! :)  i think the best man got a tiffany & co. pen.  that's what i heard but i didn't get a chance to see it.  the girls got lenox frames and the guys got swiss army knives and a flashlight!  it was pretty cool.  they have good taste!  hehe :)  alright...i guess this will be it for now.  i'm working tomorrow (today) so i need to get some sleep!  good nite people!

      today was the first time in a long time that i've been on time at work.  i think it's because of the time change.  i totally forgot about it until my friend grace told me about it.  oh well.  this past weekend, i've had a lazy kickback weekend.  i'm glad...i'm happy.  the past few weekends have always been busy for me and andy.  it just felt good to just relax!  so yeah, we didn't do much.  just hung out at home.  we rented enough and serendipity.  it was pretty good...we haven't done that for a very long time.    i was actually supposed to go to a birthday party.  we were in carson at the time but i had a head ache so we decided to skip out on it.  oh well.    so today all i did was go to work, sleep and go grocery shopping at some asian store in westminster.  we also went to target to buy my dog some poo pads! :)    tomorrow i'm planning to go to target again to buy the christina aguilera cd.  i actually have an early edition burned copy but for some reason, i want the original.  i'm normally not like that.  if i have a burned copy, that would usually be good enough.  i guess i really like her music.  her new cd is pretty good!    hmm...whatever happened to eden's crush?

      today was my day off of work!  yay!  i just hung out at home...woke up late.  i also did a little bit of grocery shopping cuz i felt like cooking tonight.  for those of you that don't know me, i don't know how to cook much.  just the basic stuff...top ramen, scrambled eggs, and warming up canned foods!  :)  ever since i moved to this condo, i told myself to learn how to cook.  i tried...i bought 2 recipe books.  i learned how to make strawberry cheesecake but after that, that was it.  so, today i was in the mood again.  i know it's no big deal but i made meatballs with sweet and sour sauce and curry vegetables.  i normally don't like curry but one time andy's mom made something with curry.  it wasn't strong at all and i loved it.  so, yeah i made vegetables with a hint of curry.  hehe.  i'm so proud of myself.

      i've been very busy this past weekend.     friday:  we had a surprise bridal shower for my co-worker at the reef restaurant in long beach.  i was in charge of the games and prizes.  my co-worker likes to pry in things so we had to throw her off by pretending her bridal shower was the potluck lunch that we had during our staff meeting break.  she was so happy...which means that we are doing a good job of throwing her off.  anyway, i got to the restaurant early.  i was originally supposed to go to my parent's house before going to the restaurant but i figured that i might be late.  in that case, i just got to the restaurant early.  i felt kinda weird just because i was the first one there...sitting all alone.  after time had passed, people would come a few at a time.  we were there during happy hour! :)  it was a fun night.  the games didn't work out as well as it should have because that restaurant was so dark.  it was so hard to see.  oh well.   saturday:  jemeline and i have been planning a surprise birthday party for grace and lynce.  it was held this past saturday.  we decided to have it at 2pm but then grace called me and told me that she (tony) was gonna run a little late...no later than 4pm.  so, we pushed the party back to 3:30pm.  people came...time passed...but were the birthday celebrants there???  nope.  they probably got there like at 6pm.  i felt so bad cuz people were there for the party and they were just waiting for grace and lynce to get there.  well, by the time they got there, jem was more excited than i was.  i guess i was just pooped by all the waiting.  i tried to not let it get to me so i just tried to put myself in that party mood.  another thing that got to me was that the person that was holding them up knew about the party.  they knew it was a  surprise  party.  oh well.  i'm over it.  so yeah, people ate, people drank, people gambled.  i got to gamble a bit too! :)  i don't know how to play a lot of card games but i was sorta willing to try that night.  i didn't really keep track of how much i lost or won.  since i wanted to walk grace and tony out while they were leaving, jason took my spot and gambled w/ my money.  he won a few quarters here and there and then...he lost!  hehe...that's okay.  oh yeah...since we were having a party, i didn't really want to have my dog there cuz she is a really hyper dog.  andy's sister ended up watching coach.  i feel bad cuz she was probably a trouble maker!  i just wish coach wasn't that hyper around people.  well, thanks christine for watching our dog! :)  christine and her friend ended up coming over to drop her off and join us in our gambling session.   sunday:  it was marissa's baby's christening in liberty park.  i woke up pretty late.  andy and i just hung around the house for a bit.  we finally got ready and stopped by hallmark to see what we can get her baby.  we didn't even know the baby's name or anything.  the only thing we knew was that she was a girl.  we ended up just getting a nice frame.  as we got to the park and was trying to figure out where the party was at, we saw an old highschool buddy...mostly andy's buddy but he was also my buddy back when we were in band in highschool.  :)  we got to talk to marvin for a bit and he's still the same old comedic person!  :)  we ended up finding the party when grace, lynce, jem, and everyone saw us and called us.  i ate a bit and just hung out there.  oh yeah...i got to see grace galvez (marissa's sister) who was also our tennis trainer.  she also is the same person.  aww...it's been a long time since i've seen that girl...i totally missed her!  :)    after the party, i was thinking of visiting my brother in long beach.  well, he was at costco w/ my mom so i tried to take advantage of the situation.  since i knew my mom was there, i decided to meet them there.  my mom ended up buying me a few things.  while we were there, my mom told me that my dad was going to the philippines.  the reason is because my cousin's grandma died about a week ago.  i think she fell or something...she was very old and fragile.  the grandpa has already been sick and doesn't really know what is going on.  he didn't even know that his wife died.  well, a few days after his wife died, he died.  so both my cousin's grandma and grandpa died just within a few days of each other.  i think it was probably a calling from beyond!  it was sad but in a way...beautiful.  they will literally be together forever.

      today is my uncle's 3 year death anniversary.  i was supposed to go visit him today at green hills but it just didn't work out.  my mom and aunt went to london and i sorta wanted to go there when they got home.  well, the time had passed and before we knew it, we had to get ready to go out to dinner with andy's family.  it was his mom's birthday.  usually, only the immediate family goes out to a nice restaurant but i guess this year they wanted to do something a little different.  they wanted to surprise their mom by having andy's aunts and uncles present too.  it was cool.  we haven't really seen anyone for a long time so it was nice to see them.    andy "claimed" that we were only gonna be there for less than an hour.  he said that cuz in actuality, i wanted to go visit my uncle at the cemetary before it got too dark.  however, knowing andy, i knew we were gonna stay there longer.  so--no disappointment.  hehe...=)    after dinner, we were on our way to carson.  jemeline left a voice message for me so i ended up calling her back while i was going to my parent's house.  it was my first time using the hands-free thingy for cell phones.  i got one a long time ago.  for some reason, i wanted the one that cost either 30 or 40 bucks.  i tried using it but it was too bulky and messy for me...even if the wire recoils itself.  after having it for a while, i just gave up on it and stored it into the closet.  recently, i took it out to try it out again but andy saw it and decided to take it from me.  he has the normal one and i tried that one out.  i like it so much better than that expensive one.  so yeah, we basically traded.  hehe.  we just hung out with my parents...mostly my mom.  she was just telling me about her trip.  she ended up getting me this cute mini rosary.  i was the one who booked their hotel room on the internet so i was very curious to know how it went.  she said that it was really nice.  anyway, my mom has a filipino accent and pronounces some stuff weird.  for example, she would say church as  CHURTS  and rich as  RITZ .  so, a lot of times, i make fun of her...just repeating how she would say things.  i do that in front of my mom and in front of andy.  my mom knows i'm just joking with her.  i'm glad she doesn't take it as offensive.  i know that because i will catch her making fun of my aunt or something.  so, i guess andy got used to saying those things in front of me ONLY.  it was so funny cuz while they were talking today, andy asked my mom..."so, did you feel  RITZ  staying in that hotel?"  right after that, i looked at him and i said..."you are actually making fun of my mom in front of her?"  he sorta got embarrassed but we all started laughing.  he was defending himself saying that he didn't mean it.  it was just so funny.  my mom was laughing so hard too!    other than that, andy and i didn't do much this weekend.  i liked it.  it's pretty cool just staying home once in a while.  we rented panic room but i still haven't had a chance to watch it.  maybe tonight since i'm off tomorrow.

      today...actually yesterday (october 11) was lynce's birthday.  so... happy birthday lynce!   we all went out to dinner at TGI Fridays in Cerritos.  i finally got to have the strawberry shortcake drink that i've sorta been craving.  after having it, it's not as good as i thought.  it sorta reminds me of the rasberry tazo w/ cream drink from starbucks.      urlLink a picture of the girls    after work, i went home and took a nap.  i was so anxious to leave work early cuz every single day this week, i've been driving in traffic.  it was my goal to leave early so that i wouldn't have to go through traffic.  for the most part, there was no traffic on my way home.  when andy came home, we hung out for a bit and then got ready for lynce's dinner thing.  it was cool to see everyone again.  both grace and suzette are pregnant.  grace with her first and suzette with her second.  YAY! :)  after dinner, there was this man outside of the restaurant drawing those caricatures (is that right?).  jem, grace, lynce and i decided to get one done with all four of us.  i felt pretty weird just cuz people are watching but it was cool.  since it was lynce's birthday, she got to take it home.    everyone went home and since wal-mart was there, andy and i decided to check it out.  we used to go to wal-mart a little more than target when we lived in fullerton.  we just don't go to wal-mart as much cuz there aren't that many around...in anaheim hills.  while we were there, we ended up running into jack, lynce, and frolyn.  hehe.  oh yeah...i got the beauty and the beast dvd.    anyway, i ended up driving home cuz (even if andy says he wasn't drunk or buzzed), he totally smelled like alcohol.  so, now i'm home.  i've been home for a while.    now i'm sleepy so i'll see you guys (who ever reads this...probably NO ONE)!  laterz...

      yay!  today i had my first customer for my party lite collection...aka candles.  i haven't really showed the catalog to anyone yet except for my coworkers.  so yeah, they were my first customers.  i'm going to pass the catalog onto my boyfriend.  he will just bring it to work and see if anyone wants anything from there.  to be honest, they have pretty stuff.  i just think they are just too expensive.  oh well.    guess what?!  the AA that all-of-a-sudden-took-off-and-left is coming back.  i'm glad bout that for one reason.  and that is...her work and responsibilities will no longer get stuck with me.  my boss was giving me more hours but since i was the temp AA a few months ago, i can't imagine going back to that position.  i told her that i was willing to help and put more hours helping out, but i will no longer take that position.  anyway, my boss had a talk with our AA.  she ended up leaving cuz she says it was deteriorating her health.  well, she has a bad case of diabetes and her son has a bad case of asthma!  how sad.  plus...the stress wont help anything at all.  i guess the stress really got to her.  so, my boss and her had a talk.  i think she was very leniant (don't know how to spell that word) in letting her come back.  she was supposed to come back today after lunch but her son ended up having an asthma attack yesterday and so she is home with him.  instead, she will be coming in and starting fresh on monday.  hmm...drama!

      i'm officially a  HO!   hehe...my coworker has been bugging me about hosting a candle party.  i didn't really think i could sell a lot of candles just by having a party.  so instead, i told her that i would just take a catalog and see what i can do!  since there is no penalty if i don't sell a thing, i decided to give it a try.  so yeah...i'm a  HO...hostess that is!   if any of you are interested in buying any candles or accessories, let me know and i will gladly pass the catalog on to you!  my friend don just left for japan today.  he's in the navy.  we had plans to go out to dinner before he left, but unfortunately, things didn't work out the way they should have.  oh well.  he called me before he left to say bye.  we have a bet...he thinks i will get married before he does and for me...i really don't know.  he just says, "i bet you'll get married before i do!"  and ummm...what do you want to bet?  he says dinner...hehe!  how lame!  but that's okay.  there's nothing better than going out to dinner!  :)

      first of all, i just want to wish  grace  a very happy birthday...before it's over and midnight strikes~!  today i went to work with a weird surprise.  our administrative assistant's cubical was empty.  everyone was wondering where her stuff was at...my boss was also wondering if she did anything that upset her and would make her want to leave.  everyone thought everything was normal.  eventually, my boss found a note on her desk saying that she is resigning her position as an AA.  there was no real explanation.  i just thought that was really odd!  besides...it's never good to leave on that kind of note.  usually, people would give 2 weeks notice as a common courtesy.  the news just took our health education department by surprise!  recently, most of us bought some stuff from her son's fundraiser in school.  a lot of us just gave her cash.  now we're just wondering if she would give us our items or give us our money back.  we should hold her check until she let's us know what's up.    anyway, i was sorta bored at work.  andy, my cousin from chicago, and i were just emailing each other.  my cousin made me laugh so hard.  i asked him how his dog was and he told me that he ran away.  he told me the story of how his parents put up signs around the neighborhood.  here's what it said:  LOST DOG lost since: september 25, 2002 color: black and white name: george kind:  towawa   i was getting ready to reply back to my cousin asking him what "towawa" meant...but while i was doing that, i said it to myself and i understood it.  it's supposed to say chiuhaha not towawa.  i was laughing so hard and was teary!  when my cousin told my uncle, he changed up all the signs!  geezz...my uncle is so funny!  i can totally see him doing that!  well, that made my day! :)  anyway, i called grace while i was on my lunch.  i sorta knew that she wouldn't answer cuz she was in school. i just left a message and while i was on my way home from work, she called.  we got to talk for a bit.  she gave me great news.  right now i'm so happy for her.  i'm not gonna say what it is at this time but i will eventually let it out on my blog soon.  :)

      i'm back!  this past weekend, i didn't do much.  andy and i just hung out at home and then visited my parents.  my mom and auntie are going to london so they asked me to go online and book them a hotel room.  i wish i could go with them.  actually, my mom was asking me today if i wanted to go and they are leaving tomorrow.  if i would've known, i would've taken this week off.  now i can't just abandon them with just a few hours notice.  that would be rude!  i miss traveling!  i used to go to chicago and new york every summer when i was in high school.  andy and i have taken a few trips ourselves in the past.  so far we've gone to china, hong kong, hawaii, san fran., canada, and chicago.  that's about it.  i keep bugging him cuz i want to keep traveling but we have to keep our expenses to a minimum.  oh well.  andy's mom is in the philppines right now.  however, she's not there for the fun of it.  she's there cuz her brother (andy's uncle) past away a few days ago.  that is so sad to hear.    speaking of that, my uncle's 3 year death anniversary is coming up on the 13th of october.  i don't think anything has been planned as of yet but that is the day that my mom and auntie will be getting back from london.  i will just visit him with some beautiful flowers.

      back from another thanksgiving party!  yup...andy's friend, ross and his family have a tradition.  every year we have dinner at his house the day after thanksgiving.  it was pretty cool.  we even went around the whole room to talk about what each person was thankful for!  too bad it was raining.  poor andy was sick too so we didn't stay as long as would normally.    we woke up around 6am this morning to go shopping.  we weren't as prepared as we were last year.  we didn't really buy any christmas gifts.  it was more of ornaments for our tree.  that's all.

         gobble gobble gobble fat turkey, fat turkey gobble gobble gobble  fat turkey are we we're not made for living, we're made for thanksgiving gobble gobble gobble fat turkey are we!     that's what my neice and nephew (kayla and justin) performed at our thanksgiving get-together.  they were so cute!  not only that, but kayla performed her dance routine!  she really has good rhythm.  she's got her moves down!  i didn't know someone her age can move like that!  haha...her performance just helped me in figuring out what i should get her for christmas!    so, today we went to my aunt's house in long beach and also andy's aunt's house in lakewood.  actually, andy's side of the family had two family parties.  one was in lakewood (which was the one we went to) and the other was in oceanside (which is the one andy's parents went to).  yup, that's right, we didn't even see andy's family!    it was pretty fun at my family party.  for the past few years, we've been coming up with themes for our thanksgiving parties!  i.e.  country western theme, pajama party theme, hawaiian theme...etc.  this year, we voted on having a patriotic thanksgiving!  everyone was to dress in red, white, and blue!  well, andy and i decided to be more creative and make our own t shirts!  i was thinking of doing a tye-dye shirt but then i'm not even sure how it would've turned out!  we ended up just buying blow pens and drawing on our own shirt!  it was cute!  =)  our party also included games (patriotic games) which included prizes!  between me and andy, we got a $10 gift card to borders, a $5 gift card to target, and lottery tix in which $4 was won!  hehe it was cool.    after the party, andy and i went to my parent's house to see if i left my christmas ornaments there.  unfortunately, i couldn't find it!  what made me happy was that my aunt (that lives across the street) just came back from hawaii yesterday and she brought me a few goodies!  thank god she knows what i like!  hehe.  well, she got me SPICY portugese sausage, li hing mui seeds, pickled mango, and macadamian nuts!  whoever knows me knows that i love li hing mui seeds!  the picked mango is just an added bonus!  one of my co-workers is also from hawaii and i know she's gonna be happy when i bring some to her!  hehe.  hmm, andy's parents are going to hawaii tomorrow...hopefully they'll bring us more goodies!  haha!  aww, andy's cousin is getting married this saturday in hawaii.  i really wanted to go but of course, we're just too broke!  so yeah, i had to send her back the response card with 2 regrets!  =(    aww...i miss andy's cousins from hawaii!  they are really cool and fun to be with.

      last night was fun!  i went out with my friends for dinner at joe's crab shack in long beach.  it was actually a surprise birthday dinner for jack.  i'm not that much into sea food but the atmosphere was great.  lynce and jack were raving so much about their barbecue crab.  don't get me wrong, i love crab.  i just need it with my rice, soy sauce and vinegar!  i also need my crab cracked for me.  i've never cracked a crab myself ever in life.  either andy or my dad does it for me!  cool huh?!  if there's crab, i will NOT eat it unless someone cracks it for me.  =)  anyway, at joe's crabshack, grace was thinking about what she was gonna drink.  she asked about their iced tea but it wasn't the kind she liked.  the waiter suggested a margarita but of course grace can't have that since she's pregnant.  she ended up getting the virgin margarita.  well, it was my turn and i said i wanted a strawberry margarita.  he asked if i was at least 21 yrs. old.  i said yeah, i'm 25 gosh-darn-it!  hehe, then he asked for my ID.  haha...i forgot it at home.  so, i actually ordered a virgin while grace ordered the alcoholic beverage and then we just traded!  our waiter was so cool!    after joe's crab shack, we all went over to lynce's house.  she had the karaoke going on but it seemed like everyone was too tired to sing.  georgia was the only one of my close girlfriends that didn't go to dinner.  since we were going to carson, i decided to call her and ask her if she wants to stop by lynce's house.  i figured that she wanted to esp. since all of lynette's kids (new baby included) were there.  so yeah, andy and i picked her up and we just hung out.  it was good.  we just talked.  i had some smirnoff but i think it was just giving me a head ache.  everytime i would laugh, it would hurt!  so, i just stopped drinking.  andy was outside drinking with the guys while the girls were inside.  why does that always happen?  =)  well, yeah...i knew i was the one who would have to drive home.    yup so that was my night!

      thanksgiving is coming up this thursday and there is so much to do.  so many parties!  traditionally, we always go to my auntie's house in long beach.  occassionally, there are parties that andy's aunt throws but usually we never really know until the last minute.  this year, andy's aunt (dad's side) called us and said she's having a party.  i assume we have to go there too along with my aunt's get-together.  but last week, when we had dinner with andy's family, i found out that another aunt is having a party (mom's side).  i think that's all the way in san diego.  i don't really know what to do.  i don't mind going to all these parties but there's just not enough time in a day!  hehe.  oh well.  andy will make the decision.  =)  not only do we have thanksgiving day parties, but we also have "day-after-thanksgiving" dinners AND another one after that.  haha.

      andy's work has been doing something with united way.  their whole organization would donate money and would also get some rewards in return.  one of the rewards that andy got were these postcard looking thingies.  each postcard represented a $10 game card from dave and busters.  andy had about 12 of those cards. the thing is, they can only accept one card per person per night.  we went to the one at the block and we asked them if they can exchange a few more but they wouldn't.  after the block, we decided to stop by irvine spectrum to exchange 2 more.  we ended up using one of the cards to play a few games.  after that, we went back to the front desk to just try to do more exchanging but uhhhh....it didn't work.  the reason why we are such in a hurry of exchanging it is cuz those postcards are good until november 30.  when you get the $10 game card, it's good basically forever.  so yeah, we have to go back a few times again.  oh well.

      tomorrow i have a freakin' staff meeting!  i hate those meetings cuz they take up the whole day and it's just so boring.  if tomorrow wasn't pay day, i would've just called in sick!  ;)  and besides that, i'm running out of time.  my cousin asked me to burn about 130 cds.  they are going to canada for a wedding and i guess the cds i'm burning are gonna be their wedding favors.  so, last sunday, my brother came over to drop off the refrigerator that we let them borrow.  after that, my cousins came over to drop off blank cds.  they gave me less than a week to finish burning but to tell you the truth, i've just been lazy.  i didn't start doing it until today.  the thing is, i just dont know when they want it.  i think it's tomorrow but i'm not sure.  oh well.   i know i'll pull through!  hehe.    a few days ago, i managed to download both mariah carey and jennifer lopez's cd before it came out in the stores.  i really think jennifer's cd is good!  i never really liked any of her albums b4 but this would have to be my favorite out of all of em.  however, christina aguilera still rules!  her cd is the best!  i also downloaded her album but i liked her so much that i went to the store and actually paid for her cd!  i even have her christmas cd (burned copy) and since the season is here, i can start listening to it again.  hehe.

      yup it's been a while since i even bothered to do another entry.    i've been really busy these past few days.    last saturday (veteran's weekend), andy and i decided that we'd go to cabazon to check out their sales...and get ahead for christmas shopping.  we bought a few gifts...not many cuz we couldn't decide.  we also bought a few things from the crate & barrel outlet.  that was my first time in that store cuz we never really bother to go to that side... they had really good deals.  from now on, i wont pass that store up whenever i'm in cabazon.  after shopping, we decided to have dinner at casino morango and gamble after.  i ended up winning $100.  i still wanted to play more but andy was talking to me...and interrupted my winning streak! =D  so after that, i ended up only winning $50 total.  oh well.  he's such a sucka!  haha.    that same night, i called my mom cuz she left a message telling me to call her back.  so i did...and she told me that my cousin maria's mom died.  she had breast cancer but before they realized it, it spread all over her body.  it even ended up going to her brain.  since she was diagnosed with cancer, she was only able to live a little less than a month.  i was so sad to hear the news.  it's sad esp. since i'm close to maria and i know that she would be hurting.  of course, you don't wanna see the people you love get hurt.  i've been busy these past few days cuz they've been asking me for favors.  i was willing to do whatever they wanted to help them in their time of need.  i put together a cd with a bunch of tagalog and english songs that relate to maria's mom.  the cd was played on a stereo for background music during the viewing.  i always thought that was a good idea instead of playing the regular funeral music.  besides...it's personalized.  we did that for my uncle when he died 3 years ago.  it was such beautiful music.  at the end, they put the cd in the coffin so that it'll be with my uncle forever.  i remember there was some talk about putting cigarettes in there...but i dont know if they ever did.  i doubt it.  my cousin also asked me to put together a program for the funeral.  i basically had the template and i just had to put in a picture.  they ended up making last minute changes on it so i stayed up so late the night before the funeral...my printer was acting up and we just had to go to kinkos to make copies.  the ceremony was starting at 9am and we got to kinkos around 8:15am.  talk about last minute!  hehe...well, everything worked out and we made it on time.  i was so tired that day.  the funeral was just this passed saturday.    andy told me that after the funeral, we were gonna go out to dinner with his family cuz it was his parent's anniversary.  to tell you the truth, i didn't wanna go cuz i was so warn out from the funeral...doing errands, projects, etc.  well, i still decided to go.  we ended up meeting his cousins from australia who also went to dinner with us.  they seem to be really nice.  we ate at green fields...a brazilian restaurant.  that place is for meat lovers.  i wouldn't really go there unless someone wants to go there for their birthday or for whatever occassion.  that's not a place i would go to with just me and andy out of the blue.  some of their meats are really good but i think they mostly serve beef there.  i felt sorry for andy's cousin cuz i guess she doesn't eat beef...she was just waiting for pork and when it came, she grabbed a few!  hehe...it was funny.    after dinner, we just hung out at my bro's house for a bit and then went home to SLEEP!

      last night andy and i went to go watch "the ring."  it was pretty cool.  yeah yeah...i got scared and jumped a few times in the theater.  i've been wanting to watch this movie for a long time now.  i also wanna watch 8 mile but since it just came out this past friday, i figured that i had more time.  the ring is already pretty old...so yeah, that's what we watched.  before that, we had dinner at soup plantation.  since it was a dreary and rainy day, we thought that soup would sooth us.  it was good.  i love that place!  today, andy and i are going christmas shopping.  i know there are sales going on so we just wanna check it out!  bye! =)

      thursday i went with my bro and his wife to pick up the keys to their new house.  yup they finally got a house...in long beach.  it's pretty...cute!    friday night andy and i went to visit and we decided to help them paint.  that was the first time i've painted.  it was fun.  but at the same time, i realized that i also enjoy watching people paint...i dunno why!  someone was saying it's probably because i like the smell.  i don't think so.  the paints that they make these days don't really smell anymore!  :)

      we finally have our dsl up and running.  after ordering or confirming our order, it only took about 3-4 days for our line to work.  that's pretty fast compared to the last time we had dsl with pacbell.  i was very impressed!  well, our dsl modem is usb.  i normally think that usb is the best but that modem is such a pain.  well, one of andy's friends had an extra ethernet dsl modem, so since he wasn't using it anymore, he gave it to us!  what a sweetie!  =)  not just that, he donated his dining table.  our table was already going...i just didn't wanna spend a lot of money buying a new one.  so everything worked out well.    so, i went to frys with andy on sunday to buy a router.  but what did we come home with?  we came home with a switcher...whatever that is.  yesterday i ended up going back to exchange it for a router.  on my way home, i decided to check out best buy.  maybe that had more choices and maybe even at a cheaper price.  well, i found the exact same one cheaper (because it was an open box) and with a $40 rebate.  the rebate at frys was only $10.  so, yup unfortunately, i had to go back to frys for the third time to get credit back onto my account.  at least i saved money!    we finally got our materials for our network and now everything works.  yay!

       IT'S A BOY!  congratulations to lynette and keith for their newest child!  this afternoon, the phone rang and before i was able to get to it, the answer machine picked it up.  it was keith's cell phone so i decided to give them a call.  so, yeah he told me the news.  lynette was still in the hospital so he just gave me the phone number to her room.  i tried calling but it was always busy!  oh well.  i'll talk to her soon.  but yeah...finally!  lynette's been feeling so uncomfortable and have been wanting to give birth for a while now!  well, that time was today and i'm glad and happy to report that everything went fine!  :)

       merry belated christmas.   i had a great christmas!  a tiring one but it was still great!    christmas eve, andy and i went to midnight mass in st. philomena.  andy really wanted to go to the church that's in anaheim hills (the one that his family goes to) but i convinced him to go to mine.  a lot of people would ask why....!!!  well, my parents don't own me or anything but i think about things!  my brother got married about 4 months ago and he moved out.  this was his first christmas with his new wife...and they are out to start new traditions...whether it's both of them going to mass by themselves or with family.  well, this year, my bro went to church with his in laws.  i figured that my mom would be sad...but understanding that my bro wouldn't be there with us during midnight mass.  i'm still her kid...and i decided that i will go to church with them (as my bro did) until i get married.  i told andy that on christmas eve, and i think he was understanding.  he thought i had a valid point.    so anyway, before mass, andy and i decided that we'll open the gifts that we got for each other.  lately, we haven't been giving each other gifts.  we mostly buy things together...electronic stuff so usually they're expensive!  well, this year, we both went on our own and got each other gifts!  i got him a ps2 and he got me a dvd player that plays karaoke and all the other formats that cd's have these days!     on christmas day...  we headed over to my aunt's house in long beach for our traditional christmas get together.  andy and i were actually the first ones to get there.  well, i wanted to be early cuz i knew we had to leave early this year.  we were there for a bit and then we had a gift exchange.  one of my cousins had me and he got me a bunch of cucumber melon stuff from bath and body works.  andy got the lord of the rings chess set!    from long beach, we went back to anaheim hills for andy's parent's get together.  it was pretty cooL!  ritche (whom i haven't seen or spoken to for a long time) was there!  it was nice seeing him.  we also got to see some of d's relatives that we rarely see!  they also had a gift exchange.  i ended up getting a macy's gift card and andy got a best buy gift card!  after being at the house for a while, andy's mom requested that his relatives go to our condo to check it out!  so, lots of people came by to take a tour.  andy's sister was basically the tour guide.  i was just busy making sure that my dog was behaving!  hehe.  i was sorta happy that all those people came over!  none of andy's family (besides immediate family) has ever come over.  a lot of my family have already seen this place.    after a while, we went back to d's parent's house and just hung our for a bit more.  well, andy and i  finally  have  AAA!   andy's family got that for us for christmas!  after that party, andy and i were back off to long beach for my brother's get together.  usually the immediate family and close cousins get together and open all our gifts together.  it was more of a relaxing atmosphere.  i changed into more comfy clothes while we watched the kids open up their gifts.  hehe...we had one more gift exchange for that night.  my cousin got me a denim purse and andy got a game for his gameboy advance.  andy and i drove separately cuz he knew he was leaving early since he was working the following day.  i was thinking of spending the night but i wanted to drop off a gift i had for my friend vanessa.  it was already late but since she was awake, i went over there.  she gave me a precious moments figurine called  calling to say you're special  or something like that.  it comes in a set of two and basically i have one and she has another one.  you know...that basic friendship thing where one friend keeps one and the other keeps the other.  :)  it's really cute.  she also gave me the perfect card.  so perfect and with so much meaning that i kept it out.  usually, i just put my cards away but i guess this one was special.    well, that was my christmas!  i got home around 2am!  i was tired but i still had a great day!

      happy birthday don!  sometimes we celebrate by having dinner!  unfortunately, he's in the navy and is stationed in japan.  he wont be back for  a while.    i just got back from a christmas party with andy's friends!  it was cool.  they had really good food.  andy made mashed potatoes from scratch.  that was good too.  i wish i can cook like everyone else!  :)    so, the other night, andy and i had to go to lynce's house to pick up my camera cuz i forgot it the last time i was there.  i wanted it so that we can take pictures at the party i just came from.  i was even able to pick up a 128mb memory stick from fry's for 49.99.  now that we switched memory sticks from 64mb to 128mb, we should be more motivated to take more pics.  but what happened?  our battery died.  we were only able to take 3 shots.  oh well.    now i'm just watching pretty woman (fav. movie) and about to rearrange the presents under the tree.  it has to be rearranged cuz we gave some gifts out at the party.  coach even got a gift!  you can totally tell that there's treats in the bag cuz she can sniff it up really good.  i had to raise it up!  hehe.  my dog is so cute!  :D

      i  love  christmas!  this year, andy and i will be busy!    usually, andy and i are with my family.  first we go to my aunt's house in long beach.  after that, we go to one of my other cousin's house for a more intimate gathering.  that is where we open all gifts...gift exchanges, gifts from coworkers, friends, etc.  however, this year, we will be going to 3 different places.        1.  auntie's house in long beach      2.  andy's parent's house in anaheim hills      3.  back to long beach (my bro's house) for a more intimate gathering i don't mind going to all these places!  i just feel bad leaving a party when everyone else is staying.    now i feel like having a christmas eve party?!!  is anyone having a party that they want to invite me to?  hehe.

      i just moved offices yesterday!  we actually just moved to the arco building next door in long beach.  it's pretty nice over there!  everyone was pretty skeptical about moving that it also made me not look forward to the moving and the packing...and the unpacking!  well, monday was our first day there.  i didn't really know where to go so luckily i found one of my coworkers and we were both exploring together.  i finally got to my cubical and decided to just familiarize myself with the floor and where other departments of molina were located.  when i went to my desk, i finally noticed a vase with flowers!  i was like...aww...how cute!  everyone got one.  the vase is pretty too!

      still at work.  i'm actually waiting for my coworker to finish doing her business.  she's breast pumping right now (or whatever you call it) and she doesn't feel comfortable pumping when she's alone.  did that sound right?  she has her own office so she pumps behind close doors but her and i are the only ones left in the department for the day.  when i leave, she'll have the whole building to herself and she just felt uncomfortable being alone!  get it?  hehe.  well, i have a head ache!

      this weekend, we took on the responsibility to babysit my neice and nephew (kayla and justin).  actually, i found out that saturday morning, kayla had this christmas dance performance in torrance memorial hospital.  andy and i wanted to go.  the thing was that it was so freakin' early in the morning.  well, my cousin told me that kayla was gonna line up at 8:30am so it can actually be anytime before that.  ...and the night before, i stayed at my brother's house in long beach till around 2am so i knew i was gonna have a hard time getting up.  well, thanks to andy, i woke up on time and we made it to her performance.  my brother ended up coming late and missed her first performance.  my auntie and my other cousins came after everything was done.  oh well.  after that, we had brunch at king's hawaiian.  the kids asked if they can spend the night at our place so they asked their parents and that's how we had them for the weekend.  we had so much fun.  it was really nice cuz the kids are growing up so fast.  everyone's busy...they're always busy with school, dance lessons, karate, etc. so we rarely get to see them now-a-days!  so yeah, we were happy that we spent time with them and knowing that they wanted to spend the night and want to come again, made us feel good!  :)  we watched lilo and stitch, ice age, and took them to watch harry potter--the chamber of secrets.  i only went cuz of the kids.  otherwise, i wouldn't watch that movie.  i didn't even watch the first one nor have i watched lord of the rings.  these are the kinds of movies that andy loves.  i, on the other hand, was falling asleep...yawning...or being restless in my seat.  finally, andy asked me to go buy a drink for the kids so i was happy that i got to get out of my seat and take a little walk.  hehe.  oh well.  oh yeah, we also made christmas stockings and ornaments.  yup, it's time to get crafty!    happy anniversary andy!

      andy and i got our christmas tree!  it's actually our first real tree together!  we went to home depot on saturday to check a few trees out.  it seems we only liked the trees that other people were holding up!  i hated that.  my eyes were probably just playing tricks on me.  well, after a while, we finally found "the one!"  unfortunately, i couldn't help andy bring the tree up cuz i had two parties to go to that night.  andy was supposed to go w/ me but then he got sick.    so, yeah, i had to go to jemeline's house in alhambra.  she now lives with jamie so they just wanted to have a little get-together with their friends.  the thing that sucked was that both jem and lynce planned a party for the same day so not that many showed up to jem's place!  among my close friends, the only person that went was jason.  so, after a while, we both left the party and went to lynce's party in carson.  she mostly invited her coworkers and some friends.  before i left jem's place, i called grace to make sure she was still there cuz then otherwise, i wouldn't really know anyone else there!  well, when we got there, grace and tony were still there and i was also able to see lynette and her family there.  she wasn't sure if she was gonna make it so i was sorta surprised to see them there!  it was cool.  tony (grace's bf) was so drunk and he made me laugh so much!  haha.    dang...i had to do a lot of driving that saturday.  in the morning, i had to drive to carson to drop something off to my cousin.  after carson, i drove back to anaheim hills (making a few stops in between...running errands).  for jem's party, i drove from anaheim hills to alhambra and then from there to carson and then from carson back to anaheim hills.  and this was all by myself since andy was sick.  i finally got home around 2:30am.  at least i had a fun night.  andy told me to wake him up when i get home so we can decorate the tree together.  so i did.  he was putting up the lights on the tree when he realized he didn't have enough to go around the tree.  so we just went to sleep and i had to get more lights the following day.

      hehe...another entry at around 3am!  =)    when i was younger, my brother and i used to be in recitals.  we both used to play the organ!  freaky, i know.  but i've never gone to a recital where younger kids (ages 4 and higher) play.  actually, i've only seen it on tv shoes.  an example would be the cosby show.  i remember seeing an episode where vanessa was playing so the whole family went to the recital.  however, everybody pretty much sucked so a lot of parents were dosing off and going to sleep. it sorta felt like that today.  today they played mostly the violin and piano.  they were all so cute but when i look at andy, i could tell, he's wanting to fall asleep.  but when my neice kalea went up for her turn, we both were wide awake to watch her.  after that, we were just waiting for the whole thing to finish!  hehe.  i guess that's mean but all we cared about was seeing my neice perform.  hehe.    after the recital, my cousin had some food catered from the loft and we were just supposed eat it and hang out at my cousin's house.  before it was time, andy and i decided to go to marukai just to check it out in gardena.  it's pretty cool.  too bad we're broke.  i just wanted to go cuz i've never been to that one before.  they have a lot of cute stuff.  also, cute stuff no one really needs but it's just cool to have!  haha.    so, we had lunch at my cousin's house.  we were there for a while.  my nephew justin kept trying to ask us if he can come over again and spend the night!  we would've loved to but we also had suzette's baby shower to go to and didn't know what time we'd be back home.  besides, he has open house for his school (on a sunday?) around lunch time.  it was funny cuz he kept trying to go up to uncle andy to ask him again and again if he can spend the night with us.  oh well.  we ended up going to suzette's baby shower.  we were super late.  it started at 2pm and we got there around 5pm.  it's cool though cuz we spent a good amount of time there.  it was nice seeing some familiar faces again.    after that, we finally got to my bro's house.  we went there cuz he was giving us a fish tank and we wanted to pick it up.  we ended up staying there a bit longer than planned.  i sorta helped my bro clean cuz he's having a super bowl party tomorrow with our cousins.  i hate football.  i'm not even looking forward to tomorrow.  my cousin's not into it either and she was saying that there's a good sale in robinsons-may.  i would go but andy and i are broke right now.  i guess i'm really tight with my money knowing that i lost in the casino.  but every freakin' weekend, there's something going on.  it's not like i'm mad or anything.  i'm happy that i get invited to these parties.  cuz before, i guess i sorta disappeared.  i didn't keep in touch with my friends as much as i do now.  therefore, i wasn't invited to certain parties.  oh well.  i guess now it's different.  i'm happy but that just means that we have to spend money on gifts.  hehe.  so, yeah, next weekend, it's marissa's kid's birthday.  ooops...i just remembered right now too....that my bro is also having a party that same day.  he's having a house warming party.  i hope i can make it to both.  of course my first priority would be my bro and sis n law's housewarming party.  we'll see what happens.    i'm sleepy but andy wants me to clean and i have to make chilli for tomorrow's get together.  i better start cleaning my room. hehe...good nite!

      geez...i'm still awake?  well, i got back from pala casino about an hour ago.  andy and i wanted to go just to go...plus we met up with grace, tony, and james.  james really came up.  tony did too.  i, on the other hand did not win.  i lost.  andy and i had a set budget to play with and i lost mine.  oh yeah...i lost more cuz i spent a little more than my set budget...but andy doesn't need to know about that!  hehe.  it was fun though.  i love that casino!  one of these days, i wanna take my parents there.  i think they would have fun.  anyway, while i was at the casino, some filipino guy started to talk to me in filipino.  i told him i didn't understand.  after that, he asked if i had any spare change.  he doesn't look poor or anything.  i think he was just too addicted to gambling.  being addicted to gambling can be so freakin' scary.  there are so many things that can happen.  i don't even wanna go there!  oh well.

      well, i just woke up a few hours ago after taking a nap.  haha...i wonder what time i shall go back to bed!?  =)    my parents finally got back from the philippines on monday.  for some reason, i was excited when they got back.  it's not like i was expecting them to bring me back anything special from there.  cuz honestly, i don't like anything she brings...i don't like the food, candy, snacks, etc.  i tried em before but never liked it at all!    so, anyway, my mom wanted to have dinner with the family so we all went to thai barbecue in carson.  it was good...i just haven't been there in a long time.  andy and i even decided to order thai iced tea with boba.  the sucky thing is that i barely drank it cuz i wanted it as a dessert.  but i guess i was in a hurry to leave and i forgot it.  sucks.  that's why i'm craving for it again.  well, after dinner, we had a family meeting.  i felt sorry for andy cuz he had to go to work the following day (well, we both did) but he stayed.  he ended up taking a nap in one of the rooms in my bro's house.  hehe.

      boy am i tired!!!  having kids for the weekend takes a lot out of you.  hehe.  well, we got them probably around 4ish.  after that, we went to king's hawaiian to order his birthday cake...after that, we also went to fry's to check out some tv's.  in my condo, there's a built in entertainment center...a place to put your tv, vcr, dvd player, etc.  well, there's a huge slot for the tv but all we had was a 19 inch!  we've always been contemplating whether or not we should get a new and bigger tv but we just haven't had money to do so.  anyway, andy bought the paper which had the fry's ad and we were checking tv's out.  we weren't planning on buying a big screen tv or anything.  we would be happy with just a 27 inch.  well, there happened to be a sale on a 27 inch flat screen.  so, we checked it out and it was some off-brand.  we just looked more and more and we ended up settling with a sharp 32 inch.  just a regular tv...no, we didn't go with the flat screen.  i really wanted a sony but we figured that we'd get a really nice tv when we move into a house or something.  the condo that we're living in is basically just a temporary fix.  we're either gonna get a house or find another condo/townhouse.  oh well.    okay, i better get some rest.

      i had such a long day today.  the problem is that i have a sleeping problem.  i have problems sleeping when i know i'm off the following day.  and then...i'd have problems sleeping the night before i have to go to work.  that's how i was when i was in school.  knowing that i'd have to study for a test or whatever it may be...just made me sleepy.  it sucks!  hehe.    well, since i missed work on monday, i decided that i wanted to go into work a little earlier today so that i can have more hours.  but what happened?  i couldn't sleep the night before.  haha...i ended up waking up late in the morning.  i had a lot of errands and appointments to go to so i decided to go in super late.  i only worked 2 hours today.  i couldn't stay late cuz it was jemeline's birthday and we were getting together for dinner.  so yeah, i ended up meeting andy there since we had to drive separately.  we stayed there so long.  the laker game was on so you can hear everyone yell.  a few times, we'd notice some people missing (andy being one of em)...and it's cuz they went to watch the game on the tv.  haha.  it was funny.  i don't care for it so it didn't matter to me.  i heard it was a good game though!  :)    anyway, so now i'm home.  i'm tired and sleepy.  but now it's the weekend.  i'm gonna start playing kingdom hearts again!  hehe.  i actually forgot about it until now!  yay for the weekend! :)   tomorrow, andy and i get to babysit my neice and nephew.  actually my nephew justin called andy's cell and left a message asking if he's available and if he can spend the night with us!  it was so cute.  he's 6 years old and he found andy's phone number and my phone number using his mom's cell  phone.  kinda scary...but cute!  it's so cute...andy really gets along with them.  it's like, he's their favorite!  when we'd go visit them and they'd see us together, they run straight to uncle andy and pass auntie trina up!  hehe.  it's funny!  i have to say, "hey, where's my hug?"  andy's basically the cool uncle cuz he plays with them (including the game yu-gi-oh) or whatever else is the latest trend...pokemon, etc.  they can get away with a lot of things cuz andy lets them.  i actually have to act like an adult.  sometimes when we're all together and we're playing with the kids, i'm the one who has to keep track of time.  i think andy loses track of time when he's with the kids!  it's funny.  the kids are so fun to be with!  they're growing up so fast!  andy and i were sorta sad cuz as time goes by, we don't keep in touch as often as we'd like.  we just enjoy the fact that they still think of us and actually called to ask if they can spend the night with us!  isn't that cute?!  hehe...yeah, so i'm excited for tomorrow.  we're going to pick them up sometime in the afternoon.  hmm...that'll probably be when i wake up!  hehe.

      today i just played kingdom hearts...but didn't really get anywhere!  oh well.  andy and i also had dinner with his family.  it was his sister's birthday so we celebrated there!  since wal mart was just around the way, we decided to check it out.  i don't go to wal mart as much as when i lived in fullerton cuz there's not one as close as it used to be.  for some reason, we wanted to buy dvd's.  so, we were looking.  there are so many that i wanna get.  signs was on sale for 14.79.  everywhere else i've seen it was 17 or 20.  i've always wanted to watch it but unfortunately i never did.  i still wanna watch that movie but i don't know if i'd like it enough to buy it.  it's a sci-fi and it's not the same watching it over and over than another comedy or whatever.  ie.  i can watch a walk to remember over and over but i can't watch the sixth sense over and over.  did that make sense?  so, instead we got barbershop.  i also wanted to get gi jane.  i've always wanted to get that movie for years but i just never did.  well, since that was 8 bucks (reg. price) and barbershop was on sale, i decided to get what's on sale and get gi jane later.  yup...just putting it off again!  hehe.    now i just got done watching real world!  this is the only real world that i've got stuck on!  hehe.  good nite!  :)

      friday night, i felt like learning how to cook a new dish.  i'm someone who barely knows how to cook....and i don't like touching raw meat...but i'm trying to get over it or just get used to it.  well, i felt like chilli.  so, when i got home from work, i picked andy up and we both went grocery shopping so i can get the ingredients.  when we got back home, i was doing everything to make the chilli.  it took nearly 2 hours to cook.  surprisingly, it was good!  at least it was to me and andy.  towards the end of my chilli cook off, andy started making some spam masubi.  it was good too!  i haven't had that for a long time.    later, my brother called me with some interesting news.  he wanted to come over and talk about it.  so, he did and since he didn't eat dinner, he ate some of my chilli.  i was happy that someone else was able to try it too!  hehe.  well, he brought some home!   now i'm home alone cuz andy went out to help a friend of his move offices.  now i'm planning to clean for today! haha yeah right!

      i just got back from having dinner at joe's crab shack!  i guess that's a popular place to have a birthday dinner/lunch!  they usually make the birthday celebrant do some wacky stuff.  so, we were there for maureen's birthday.  they put a mustard uniform on her and she had to give mustard to whoever asked for it!  weird...but it was cool!    well, yeah it was cool to see my friends again!  :)  when jason invited me to this thing, he said that he had a special surprise for everyone!  well, the news is that maureen's pregnant!  yay!  i bet they're so excited!  after dinner, we (me, andy, lynce, jack, jem, grace, and tony) went to starbucks to just talk and hang out!  that was nice.  i had to leave a little early cuz i had to go to my brother's house since my mom was gonna be calling from philippines.  well, by the time we got there, we missed their phone call by 10 minutes!  oh well.  i think they'll be back sometime next week.  oh yeah...happy birthday to maureen and to vanessa!  :)

       happy belated new year!   i always start off late!  hehe.    these days i've been so busy...with work and the holidays.  since it's the beginning of the year, things will probably calm down.  andy and i just got back from spending a night in san clemente.  andy's friend's mom owns a time share right by the beach so a few of his friends came by.  i had a great time.  the food was so yummy!  thanks kristina!    the guys were out in the balcony gambling and andy ended up winning 10 bucks.  he went back inside to tell me the great news and i said..."oh...you can treat me to ice cream with that."  well, joey heard and he said that they had ice cream in the freezer.  it was mochi ice cream.  at that time, i've never heard of it or tasted it ever in life.  he told me to give it a try but i didn't really want to cuz i thought it was like a cream puff.  ....and i don't really like those.  well, the ice cream flavor was coffee so i tried it!  it was the best thing ever!  hehe.  on our way home from san clemente, andy and i went to murukai and bought 3 boxes.  now...we are officially members of that store.  that store is pretty cool!  i've always heard about that place but i've never actually gone there!  so yeah, this was my first time and it was cool!  we bought some unnecessary stuff but it was cool.  we also decided to get some dinner from there.  we got food from L&L's.  yay!

      well, i just got back from jem's house.  we had a  urlLink surprise baby shower  for grace!  i got to jem's house around 2pm to help her out with decorations and last minute stuff...while i sent andy out to pick up our food orders!  =)   i think the party went pretty well.  it actually got crowded cuz we were worried that not too many people would show up.  grace was really surprised.  she knew something was up but thank god for lynce...she made it seem that there was something going on for her but during jack's graduation party.  she didn't really say it out loud but hinting that there's something going on during his party which is next saturday!  hehe...that's why it threw her off and she ended up being really surprised at her shower!  it was cool.  there was so much food!  my mom is so nice!  well, basically 5 girls hosted the party and each girl had to bring 2 main dishes.  well, andy cooked salmon and i asked my mom to cook palabok.  around 4pm, i was ready to pick it up so i walked from jem's house to my parent's house to pick up the food and i basically hitched a ride back with georgia.  georgia came with me inside my house and i saw my mom cooking a bunch of lumpia!  i was curious as to why she was cooking that!  hehe...she's nice cuz she made it for the party!  she's all like..."i like grace...she's a nice girl so i'm making this for the party!"  how sweet!    we had a few games.  the beer drinking one was funny.  we filled a bunch of baby bottles up with beer and had the guys drink it.  whoever finished first was the winner.  well, janzen (suzette's bf) won!  other people cheated...hehe but they didn't win!  the prize was a huge coffee mug filled with condoms!    anyway, i'm so glad that this surprise shower is over!  it was so much work!  besides...i'm also helping with grace's other (women only) shower next sunday!  poor grace was worried that no one was gonna show up to her shower next week.  we told her that we'd all still be there!  i know she wanted her "real" shower to be a big one but for some reason decided to only make it women only.  we just thought it would be nice to invite some old high school friends, "the guys," etc.  yeah...so it was nice seeing some old faces!    tomorrow (today), andy actually wants to go to a bridal show!  we might go with some of his friends.  how weird huh?  well, i told him that i'm not really into it anymore cuz i don't have any use for that crap!  hehe...that was supposed to be a big hint!  haha!  but he still said he wanted to go.  we'll see.  it's already late and i don't know if i would wake up on time.

      happy belated valentine's day!  i've been meaning to blog but i just haven't!    anyway, for valentine's day andy and i worked but we both got off early.  we decided that we wanted to try out that buffet at pala casino.  well, on my way home from work, grace called me and asked what i was doing.  she was actually thinking of going to vegas that weekend since she got a newer car.  i just told her that andy and i are going to pala so she decided that she wanted to go as well.  since we were doing other stuff, we just met grace and tony up there.  the last two times i went there (w/ grace) i've done really bad....LOST!  well, since i was gonna see grace, i brought the sample of the baby shower invitation as well as the favor labels.    after we got back from the casino, andy and i received a message from my nephew justin!  he was basically asking if he and kayla can spend the weekend with us.  well, how can we say no to that?!  hehe...so we ended up picking them up!  since we had to go to carson to drop it off, i passed by grace's house to drop off the invitations for her to send out.  oh yeah...andy bought the big fat greek wedding dvd.  i've never actually seen it before but it's so funny.  it sorta reminds me of my family!  i really wanna watch it with my parents too!  hehe!  oops..but they dont have a dvd player yet!  oh well.

      i had a busy weekend.  friday, i stayed at work longer than expected!  they're asking me to conduct a survey to provider offices today so instead, i asked if i can just make the calls at home rather than driving to long beach.  so, that's why i'm here at home now!    after work, i just stayed home and cleaned up a bit!  andy was at his friends house playing mordheim!    the following day (saturday) was andy's friend's (joey) birthday.  we had dinner at a japanese restaurant in pasadena.  actually, we ate there cuz his girlfriend's parents own that restaurant.  it was so good!  after dinner, we all drove to burbank to go to some bar/club/restaurant.  it was only a $5 cover charge but that place sucked bad.  we just left so we ended up wasting some money.  no big deal though!  haha.  since that didn't work out, we just walked around for a bit!  there was nothing else to do so we ended up just going home.  i was sad cuz originally, we were supposed to go to cues after dinner but one of his friends had so many bad memories in that place that he didn't wanna go there!  oh well!    sunday, i went out with my girl friends.  i finally gave lynette's kids their christmas gifts!  hehe...so late!  it's cuz i haven't seen lynette for such a long time now!  anyway, the girls just went shopping together!  it was fun but tiring!  it was worth it though!  after that, i just went to work to finish up one of my boring projects/tasks!  haha.

      yipee!  i just woke up!  yesterday it was my bro's housewarming party!  i didn't really know what time it was.  i heard it was at 1pm and/or at 11am.  but i guess it didn't matter cuz andy and i got there almost at 2pm.  i felt bad but honestly, i didn't know what time it started.  i didn't get an invitation (saving money) but i saw it & i guess i forgot!  oh well.    well, when we got there, there was so much drama...probably more for me than any other.  just to let ya know, i have a phobia with birds and feathers.  as andy was parking the car, we saw a huge hawk take one of those black crows down.  well, all those hawks were mad so they were making all sorts of noises.  the crows even came as close as going on the curb instead of just the trees.  i was so scared.  i screamed and one of the neighbors heard.  i wanted to just stay in the car and wait but i figured that i shouldn't.  so, i was holding on to andy (looking down the whole time so i wouldn't see the birds) and i was walking really fast to my bro's house.  everybody was pretty much hanging out in the back yard and that's where we entered from..........well, i was upset, scared, and i felt like i was gonna cry!  when i entered the backyard, i just talked bout how the hawk took down a crow...blablabla---i didn't even really say hi to everyone.  but when they heard crow, everyone went to the front to watch.  there were so many people watching...not just people from our party but the neighbors as well.  it was cute too, cuz a lot of people ended up meeting each other.  well, the hawk was in the middle of the street with the crow for about 45 minutes.  some cars were able to fit through the street without hitting the birds.  however, there was a school bus that tried to go through the street and it couldn't fit.  he had to reverse to get out!  hehe.  even if i hate birds, it was so sad to see that crow suffer like that.  we all just saw the hawk eat at that other bird.  that hawk was huge.  my bro took some cool pics that i should eventually post up.  well, 2 cops ended up coming as well as animal control.  my cousin wanted to call the news but abc7 was closed!  hehe.  oh yeah...there was this old lady riding her bike and she was brave enough to ride through the street!  being in a car is one thing.  it's not bad cuz you're protected by a hunk of metal.  but the bike?  you're not really protected...and imagine if the hawk was upset that she passed through.  geez!  scary dude!  =0  so, yeah that was my drama!  i couldn't eat for a while.  i try not to make a big deal out of it but i can't help it!  i'm just a little kid.  my cousins kept asking if i was okay...and even asking why i'm watching.  i always try to push myself (when i'm not in danger) just so i can attempt to face my fear!    after that whole drama, we got back to the party.  my friend lynce ended up coming over to pick something up.  andy ended up leaving early cuz it was one of his friends' birthday and they were meeting at some chinese restaurant.  i didn't wanna go cuz there was food at the party and i just wanted to save money.  besides, the plan was to go to yankee doodle after dinner.  so, andy was gone for a while and when he got back he had another bird story!  hehe.  well, they ordered 2 fried chickens at the chinese place.  when they received it, the heads were still on!  has anyone seen such a thing?  that is so nasty...with the beak and eye sockets?  yuck!  i'm so glad i wasn't there.  his friends ended up taking the two heads on chop sticks and pretended to cock fight!  i've only seen that happen on a talk show.  some family ordered a bucket of fried chicken and when they got home, they found the chicken head fried and everything!  well, that traumatized that family!  YUCK!    after andy's dinner, he went back to my bro's house to pick me up.  we also wanted to take my cousin steve (from chicago) cuz last night was his last night here.  so, we were also asking other people to come along with us.  my bro ended up coming with his friend ritchie.  i had 2 drinks and i had a good buzz!  i haven't had any alcohol in me for a long time now.  i was a happy camper!  hehe.    so, everyone wanted to eat out but we had a hard time figuring out where to go.  instead, we were gonna go to the grocery store and buy ingredients to make a pizza.  well, everything was closed.  andy and ritchie ended up staying in the house so it was just me, my bro, and cousin steve that went back out for the pizza.  steve was all like...it's been a long time since just 3 of us went out for a drive late at night!  hehe...we used to always do that whenever steve was in town.  i even mentioned that in my speech that i said for my bro's wedding.  ---that i'll miss those late night drives that we take...even with our cousin steve!  haha...so, last night, i said my speech was true!    okay, well, i better go!  i'm going back to my bro's house cuz steve is leaving today!

      last friday i was gonna have lunch at my mom's house in carson.  on my way there, there was a one-laner construction zone on willow/sepulveda.  all of a sudden, i hear a noise.  i actually thought it was the crane outside.  but my car started to feel a little weird so i turned off my radio.  haha...it was my car!!!  i was able to make a right on main street and when i stepped on the gas, my car just died.  i had enough momentum to pull myself over to the curb!  phew!!!!  i ended up calling my parents house hoping that my dad would be there so he could pick me up but he wasn't home....as always.  so, i called my aunt's house (who lives across the street) and she ended up waking my cousin up.  i was so lucky that he was there.  i also called andy and he was actually on his way!  haha.  during this whole thing, i was calm.  there's something about getting stuck in a neighborhood that you're familiar with.  i would've been so stressed out if i got stuck elsewhere.  so...thank you god!  i ended up calling my work just to let them know what's up.  they were fine with it and just wanted me to take care of my car.  so, the tow truck finally got there and we got it towed to an auto shop.  we're kinda scared of what the outcome will be...price-wise.  the car is still there and wont be ready until tomorrow.  that's why i decided to work yesterday (sunday).  i'm out of a car so i had andy drop me off yesterday...and for tomorrow, my bro is letting me borrow his car.  yippee.  anyway, after we left the autoshop, we decided to go to delamo mall.  it's been so long since i last went there.  since it was payday for me, i wanted to buy myself some stuff.  since my car was in the back of my mind, i only ended up spending $30.  hehe.  so, after the mall, where did we decide to go?  we ended up going to disneyland!  yay.    the following day...saterday we were supposed to go to an engagement/housewarming party all the way in lancaster.  i ended up not going cuz i was just worried about my car.  saturday night, we ended up going to HB (huntington beach) for a barbecue.  supposedly it was to discuss the wedding with the whole group but i don't know if that ever happened??  hmm.     i made home-made chocolate chip cookies!  hehe...it kinda got burned!

      sometimes when i'm at work, i'll call andy.  he usually gets home way before i do.  anyway, we'll just talk on the phone or whatever and i would ask what coach is doing.  and then i ask him if he can put her on the phone.  hehe...andy will just tell her to speak and she'll bark!  haha...i think that is so cute!  =)

      i forgot to mention something.  once in a while, i'll visit genesis's website.  people still would leave their guestbook entries every so often.  the last two that i've seen were from gen's mom.  she is so cute and it was so touching!!!  the first entry went something like this:  we are now in war w/ iraq and i heard a few of your friends are in the military.  will you please be their angel...guide them, protect them.  the second entry went something like this:  i know that you used to teach me how to use the computer but for some reason, i was scared.  now i'm able to go on the computer and chat with other people.  the chat room that i go to is angels of the bereaved parents.  awwww...i think those two entries were so touching!  these probably weren't the exact words but that's basically what she said.  i told my bro and he got goose bumps.  i told andy and he kinda talked about wedding dresses.  what a change in subjects?!  i was disappointed (sometimes i think he doesn't have emotions--he's a robot!)  however, he did talk about wedding dresses since that was what we were talking about before i changed the subject!  but still...does my boyfriend really have feelings?  cuz i was really touched with what gen's mom said.  oh well!!!

      saturday i met up with mary and kristina to search for a wedding dress!  it was pretty fun...even though we got lost!  searching for a dress is so freakin' tiring!  we went to a few places, tried on many dresses...and i think mary found "the one!"  she put it on hold so she can show it to her mom before she orders it!  how cute!  we were out for so long...at least it felt long cuz we were tired and hungry!  after everything, we decided to meet the guys and a few other people for dinner at red robin!  finally...we get to eat!  hehe.  well, the girls decided to play a little trick on some of the guys (besides ross since he's not supposed to see the dress).  we picked out the ugliest dress from the catalog and told them that that's the dress she got.  she pretended that she ordered it and had already put a down payment!  hehe.  it was so funny cuz andy and some of the other guys were actually saying that dress was pretty!  HAHAHA!  omg...was that a total lie or what?  i hope he didn't think it was nice!  hehe.  after dinner, we just went back to mary's apt. in HB to hang out!  kristina made creme-bru-lay!  haha...i have no idea how to spell that.  i ended up missing it though cuz my parents and brother were going to pechanga and i wanted to go with them.  they ended up picking me up from HB so andy can just drive my car back home.  did i win at the casino?  nope.  at least i didn't put in that much money.  i'm just broke right now.  after the casino, my bro was going to drop me off at my condo in anaheim hills.  when we got there, i took out my keys to open up the door and what do ya know?  andy ended up giving me the wrong keys.  i also have keys to andy's parent's house and it looks very similar to our condo keys.  we just don't normally use keys since we go through the garage.  i kept ringing the door bell...hoping andy would wake up but he didn't!  i ended up having to spend the night at my bro's house in LB.  i was very dissapointed.  i didn't think i was going to sleep very good--but i did!  i guess i was really tired.  my carson dog (maX) is now staying with my bro and sis in law.  i was excited to finally see him!  hehe.  so, when i woke up, the first thing i did, was go outside to visit max.  after that, i called andy asking him to pick me up and bring coach as well.  it was so scary to see those two dogs together at the beginning.  they just had to get used to each other and they were kinda fine!  hehe...it's just that max hasn't been neutered and he's always wanting to hump coach.  it's funny...cute!  haha.    for lunch we all decided to eat at ports o call.  it was so yummy.  everything was fresh.  we bought some shrimp and they cooked it with some vegetables and potatoes right in front of us.  it was yummy.  we ended up taking that "to go" so we can just have a picnic at the park.  it was cool.  it's a nice thing to do once in a while.  however, my meal would've been better if i could eat some rice.  hehe.  the rest of the guys were making me jeolous but i'm strong...i still haven't given up!  haha.    that was pretty much my weekend.  it was cool cuz i was able to hang out with some friends AND hang out with my family!  hehe.  man...tomorrow...back to work again!  good nite (to no one that reads this blog!  haha).

      tuesday march 18, 2003, coach turned 1 year old!  tuesday march 18, 2003 marked the year anniversary of andy and i living in this condo.  what a coincidence huh?  we moved in anaheim hills the same day that coach was born!!!!!  it was meant to be!  haha.    so, tuesday, we decided to feed coach with her "wet" dog food.  she usually gets so excited when she's having that food...but we never let her eat until we say "GO!"  so, we wanted her to stay for a bit while we sang "happy birthday" to her!  hehe...i know, corny!  well, we sang to her and it's like she was singing with us.  but in actuality, she was whining and barking cuz she wanted to get to her food!  i just thought it was cute cuz it was like she was joining in on her song!    today (friday), andy and i decided to work only half of the day.  actually, i had to prepare and go to a meeting all the way in san bernardino.  that meeting ended at 2pm and i wasn't about to drive all the way back to long beach.  so, andy also decided to work half day so we can go to disneyland.  we met joey and kristina over there.  kristina had to leave early cuz she had to work that night but joey wanted to stay with us cuz he wanted to watch the aladdin show.  so, we watched it and i really liked it!  it's probably cuz i've always liked that movie to begin with!  if you're not really into it, then it might not be worth the wait.  yes...there's a wait to watch that show...in fact the line gets so long!  also, you have to get the tix in advance!  if not, you're screwed!  hehe.    after disney, we went to sam woo's for dinner.  i kinda got grossed out again cuz i saw chickens and ducks already cooked with their heads still on!  i saw that when we first got in that place and already got grossed out!  it was already fried and everything!  well, when we were leaving, i decided to look at it again and i saw another one at the bottom!  it was even more scarier to me because it didn't looked cooked!  i took one look at it and i had to turn my head and look the other way cuz it was disgusting...only cuz i'm really sensitive to that (and YES, i hate it when people mock me even more when i'm in that situation!)  so, being grossed out and kinda scared, all 3 of us walked out of the door.  as i was walking out, i had my phone in my hand and it vibrated!  i got so scared...but at the same time...it was funny!  hahaha.    last night, i bought 8 mile uncensored at best buy!  i actually bought it the day it came out (tuesday) but i didn't know they had 2 versions.  so, now i have to return the regular one at wal mart.  oh well.  i've never actually seen that movie in the theaters but i still decided to buy it cuz i love eminem.  there's something about him that i like so much.  i've never actually bought (only burned) his cd's.  when he first became popular, i knew his lyrics by searching for them online--and then eventually i would memorize it.  hehe.  andy was so surprised cuz i normally wouldn't listen to rap!  anyway, last night, i tried to watch it.  i was really tired so i didn't fully get into it!  i'll have to watch it again.    today, the kids were supposed to spend the night.  they asked us last week and of course we said "yes!"  so, we called them but no one was home!  haha...they stood us up!  oh well.  it's okay...at least i'll have more rest this weekend.  besides...tomorrow i'm supposed to go with mary and kristina to a few bridal salons to check out some wedding dresses!  how fun!  i can't wait till i get engaged...dragging along some of my friends to help me find the perfect dress....in my new mercedes!  hahahaha...only in my dreams...as real as it may seem!  (hehe...debbie gibson).    good nite!

      yes we ended up getting our disney passes.  we went to south coast plaza on saturday to get our passes at the disney store.  i kinda feel guilty but we'll see if we can make it worth it!!!  after get our passes, we decided to eat at (the fast food version of) lawrey's.  it was alright but i guess i was expecting better!  oh well.  anyway, the following day (sunday), we went to disneyland.   urlLink (see pictures)   i kinda felt like a little kid.  i wanted a balloon, churros, popcorn, cotton candy, etc.  of course i didn't get them all...only a churro but it was still fun.  when we got there, we met all my cousins at it's a small world.  there ended up to be 13 of us.  my aunt (mom's sister) even went!  so, we just hung out for a while...waiting for kayla's parade!  so, it finally started!  dang...kayla dances too sexy for her age!  hehe...it was cute!  after the parade, all the dancers were going to do another routine on a stage!  that show was pretty long!  we were just waiting for kayla to go on...but it felt like forever!  the whole show ended up to be around 2 hours!  so, after that, kayla was able to stay with us and go on rides!    i guess we're all spoiled with the "fast pass."  i think that's a good idea.  i actually didn't know about it until yesterday.  that just makes me feel even better that we got the pass.  hehe!  anyway, andy's friends has passes too so they decided to come by during the night.  we met right when we got off the space mountain ride.  they wanted to get on it too so andy went with them while i stayed w/ my cousins.  it didn't take long for them though.  since joey has leukemia (well, he's in remission), he gets to have a special assistance pass...which means he has to hardly ever wait in line!  cool huH?    anyway, we were trying to figure out where we should go for dinner.  we finally decided on rain forest cafe in downtown disney...but the wait was about an hour.  some of them wanted to eat at sam woo's in long beach but andy and i didn't wanna go far from home.  so, we just stayed w/ andy's friends.  we ended up eating dinner at disney california!  i was kinda excited since that was my first time over there.  i finally got to ride that mickey mouse roller coaster!  i liked it so much that we went on it twice.  after that, we decided to call it a night since we all had to work the following day!  but did i go to work today?  nope!  i called in sick cuz i woke up with bad stomach cramps.  ummm...yup that time of month again!

      hehe...it feels so nice to sleep in!  yesterday i stayed at work till almost 7pm helping out with a project.  i was in a hurry cuz i was supposed to meet everyone in huntington beach for dinner at andy's friend's house.  so...i finally left work and i still had to get gas.  i ended up taking the side streets over there.  it wasn't bad..considering that i didn't really know where i was going!  i was just following the directions that i got.  when we got there, all the girls were just looking through the bridal magazines!  hehe it was pretty fun!  after a while, we had dinner.  they had pretty good food...and there wasn't even any meat!  hehe.  and yes...i still haven't had rice!  i'm so proud of myself.  i'm not sure if i mentioned it in this freakin' blog, but i gave up rice for lent!  =D    after a while, ross started to show us the slideshow that he did during his engagement...plus the video of the actual event and everyone's reactions!  it was pretty cool.  he's very talented!  i eventually wanna learn how to use those programs!  we'll see.  anyway, the reason they asked us to come over for dinner was because they asked us to be in their wedding!  i was so shocked.  when andy told me that we're supposed to go to mary's house for dinner, i asked him if he's sure?  i would think that they're only inviting those that they are gonna ask...but ross said me too!  still not really expecting anything...i went.  so, yes, they asked andy to be a groomsman and me a bridesmaid!  yay...another wedding to be in!  they are going to have 6 couples in the bridal entourage including the best man and maid of honor.  yay...time to start planning.  i might go with mary to a bridal salon to look for her dress.    anyway, later today, andy and i might go to the mall.  we'll see if we can get our passes at the disney store.  bye for now!

      wow...i can't believe i'm still working full-time!  hehe!  i didn't think i'd last cuz lately i've been tired.  but i guess i'm pretty good! yay!  and tomorrow is pay day!  =D    anyway, i haven't been up to anything lately!  i just found out that my neice kayla is going to be dancing in a parade in disneyland on sunday.  i wanna go...but it's so freakin' expensive to get in.  andy has always wanted an annual pass there!  it's really expensive but after a while, it's worth it!  besides...we are really close to disney!  we always held off on getting the passes cuz it's just so much money to put out at one time!  i'd rather use that money to start building another computer!  but now that kayla's gonna perform, i figure that since we're going, we have to make a decision...whether we want the passes or just pay for a day thing.  grrrr...what shall we do?

      right now i'm just uploading pics to ofoto.com.  in the meantime.........  andy and i just got back from san clemente.  we spent a night over there!  nothing was really planned.  we were originally supposed to go to san diego zoo but we didn't think it was worth it since they close early.  we ended up just driving around locally.  we stopped by the tidepool exhibit?  it was pretty cool.  we stayed there for a while.  it's a nice place to go to...only 5 bucks to get in!  =)  after that, we went to the mission in san juan capistrano.  that was my first time going to one of those places.  it was very beautiful.  i wanna take my mom there sometime!  andy and i ended up buying a small cross to hang at our house and an angel to put on my car visor.  i wanted to light a candle for my uncle but we couldn't find their little candles.  oh well...it's the thought that counts right?!  =)  anyway, i was kinda disappointed since we didn't go to san diego.  i wanted to at least walk around down town area...get some drinks...just hang out!  it seemed like everyone was tired.  after the mission, we went back to the timeshare, hung out some more and started cooking for dinner.  i was asking andy if we can leave a little earlier so we can at least stop by san diego area.  he said, "okay."  but did that happen?  he was playing mordheim and gambeboy advance!  i was getting kinda irritated but that was already expected.  it's always the same thing!  blablabla!    later, the girls were just hanging out together and we got to talk to mary about her wedding.  they're planning to have their "big" wedding this year!  whoa...everything is happening so soon!  while we were talking about that stuff, the guys were upstairs cooking and playing their freakin' games!  hehe.  right before andy and i were getting ready to leave, we also got to talk to ross (his perspective) about the wedding.  i'm so happy for them!  =)  so, we finally left and i asked andy if we were still gonna stop by san diego.  of course...knowing him, he would say no.  he felt bad so he's all like since we still have sunday, we can go to the outlet or something!  hehe...i'm not complaining about that!  yay!  =)  we'll see!    now i'm home and uploading more pics online!  bye for now!

      today was ash wednesday.  i really wanted to go to church.  it didn't really matter where as long as i went.  well, since i was working late tonight, i asked andy if we can just meet at st. philomena since i also had to drop something off at my parent's house.  i ended up leaving work a little late (6:45pm).  i thought we had enough time but by the time we got there, the church was packed!  when we got closer to the door, we read a little sign and it said that mass started at 7pm!  oops.  i didn't even feel like it was church cuz it was so crowded that we couldn't even get in the door!  ........not to mention, everyone was loud!  we had to just stay outside in the cold air!  we ended up bumping into grace and tony over there!  we hung out by the fountain and when they came out to give the ashes, we got the ashes, and we were just on our merry way to our cars!  i feel bad.  well, we couldn't really do anything since it was too crowded to even get inside.  oh well.  after that, we went to seafood city to buy some asian food!  hehe.    my mom bought me some plants for my house!  they're probably gonna die!  so sad!  =l

      i'm at work right now just wasting my time away!  hehe.  anyway, i haven't blogged for a while cuz i've been busy.  the day after jack's graduation party was a 2nd baby shower for grace.  this time the sisters were in on it...and so was i.  hehe...thank goodness the party planning is over!  it was worth it!  grace's shower this past sunday was cool.  it was girls only...which is the first i've been to.  the rest of those showers were co-ed.  it was quite an experience.  =)  once again, grace and tony got a lot of gifts for their baby.  probably too much where they have to return a few items.  oh well.  that's what always happens.  hehe.  well, in this case, having too much is better than not having enough.  at least they're getting prepared for when baby gavin arrives!  =)  anyway, when i was driving on monday, i was listening to one of the cd's i made.  the song that was playing was "a moment like this" by kelly clarkson...former american idol.  when that song was on, it totally reminded me of ross, mary, and their whole proposal/engagement thing!  it was so beautiful!  hehe.  i think that song will forever remind me of those two!    this weekend, we're supposed to go to san clemente again cuz joey has a timeshare over there.  ross and mary will be there too so maybe i can find out what their wedding plans are!  hehe...i'm probably too ahead of myself.  oh well.

      today (well, saturday) was such a good day!  andy and i had two parties to go to.  one was his friend's cousin's baby shower and the other was jack's graduation party.  we basically took our time.  we just hung out at home for a while.  i wanted to make sure we got to his friend's house on time cuz we still had to go to jack's in buena park.  so yeah, we got to the first party.  people were there already but it was mostly family.  the rest of andy's friends came shortly after.  time was passing by so we had to get going!  we ended up missing the games and the gift opening.  when we were leaving and already in the car, andy said that we have to come back.  i didn't really know why but i told him that i didn't want to.  he just kept trying to convince me.  i sorta got upset but he said that we can go to jack's party for a while, go back to ross's, and then back to jack's AGAIN!  he wouldn't exactly tell me why...just that there was gonna be a special prize given out at the end of the baby shower.  i didn't really care for that but by that time...i was just like..."whatever!"    so we finally got to jack's party.  after being there for only 10 minutes, andy gets a phone call and he says that we have to go back to ross's house now.  yup...we ended up leaving jack's party but told everyone that we'd only be gone for about an hour or so.  when we got back to the baby shower, they were just finishing up opening the gifts.  ross has a digital camera so he was showing all the pictures that was taken throughout the shower on the tv.  they even played baby music in the background.  it was basically a slide show.  it was so cute!  anyway, after the baby shower slide show was done, it continued onto another screen that said something like this..."mary jocelyn somera, please turn around..."  so, mary turned around (wondering what was going on...like everyone else) and ross was right behind her.  he was holding her hands and made some kind of speech!  very romantic!  i got so emotional!  ...and then he got down on one knee and popped the question!  it was so romantic.  we were all screaming and cheering!  it was such a beautiful moment!  now i know why andy wanted to go back to the party.  he knew about it cuz we told them that we had another party to go to.  so, basically in order to convince andy to come back, he was let in on the secret!  it was so worth it!    he told me that he was so excited that he had butterflies in his stomach!  how cute!  hehe.  after mary said "yes," ross announced that he had another slide show for us to watch.  it was basically pictures of them together, family, and friends.  i felt so special to be in their little slide show!  hehe.  after that was done, there were a few kids that came out of some room.  one kid had a bouquet of roses, another kid had "congratulations on your engagement" balloons, and the other kid had a cake!  it was so cute!  i didn't know ross could be that romantic!!!!!!   job well done!  =)  hehe.  that was actually my first time to witness a proposal!  it was nice to have all his family and friends there to witness that special moment including her parents!  YAY!  i think sometimes i get jeolous of couples who are getting married.  one of my coworkers (from another department) just got engaged on valentine's day and i straight out said..."wow...i'm jeolous!"  right after i said that, i was like..."oops...did i say that out loud?"  i felt so dumb!  but when ross and mary got engaged today, there was no ounce of jeolousy in me!  i was and am genuienly (sp) happy for them!  i guess it depends on if i know the person or not.  i don't really know that coworker well enough to really care for her and be happy for her!  hehe..cruel huh?  however, i do know ross and mary and i know that they deserve all the happiness in the world.  therefore, i am so happy for them!  i can't wait...i wanna help out with their wedding plans!  hehe...more bridal shows to go to?  hehe............i had such a great feeling today!  they both made me feel good!  i'm happy that one of our friends is finally getting married.  i've never actually gone to a "friend's" wedding before.  hopefully i'll be invited to this one!  hehe!  i found it funny cuz earlier during the baby shower, mary and i were talking about weddings/bridal shows without having a clue about the proposal!  that was the best...  so, after that romantic event, andy and i went back to jack's party.  i got there happy cuz of the proposal!  jack was so out of it!  yes...the alcohol!  =)  he ended up leaving the party to go to sleep!  poor him!  we just hung out at the party for a while and now i'm home.  YAY!  it was such a great night!  i know...i'm too corny!

      so...i got my first bonus check the other day!  =)  i actually didn't think i was gonna get one just because i'm only working part time!  well, i'm not complaining!  starting monday, i will be  temporarily  working full time!  finally huh?  it's because some of the educators will either be out for surgery or because of pregnancy.  it's still only on a temporary basis--probably for a month but at least i'll be getting more on my paycheck!

      snowball just died today!  =(  for those of you that don't know (which is probably everyone), i had a best friend named voneta.  we were best friends ever since we were born (practically).  well, eventually, we faded and we rarely ever talk and see each other.  well, when we were still in elementary school, her aunt was giving away a white dog!  i thought that was the coolest dog ever!  i didn't think that i was allowed to get that dog since my mom isn't that much of a dog lover.  eventually, she broke down & let me have snowball...but i was the one that was responsible!  i didn't really wanna ask anything of my parents cuz i guess that was a bad time in our lives.  both my parents got laid off around the same time!  soon after, my dad had a stroke and ended up in a county hospital!  ....which also left them with thousands of dollars worth of hospital bills.    so, yeah, i had snowball for a while until.....one day i was walking him with voneta and all of a sudden, 2 pit bulls came running out and just attacked snowball.  voneta and i were so scared and until this day, i feel guilty cuz i was too scared to get snowball out!  those dogs really had him!  i remember one of the pit bulls lifting snowball up with his mouth!  finally, the owners came out and kicked the other 2 dogs.  poor snowy was covered up with blood.  at that time, we had to take him to the emergency clinic.  ummm...what does that mean for a little girl like me?  i didn't have money to pay for all the treatment he needed.  my cousin basically took over the ownership.  i was fine with that.  my cousin and i were very very close.  in fact, she lived across the street and i used to label her as my "favorite" cousin!  i was even her maid of honor @ her wedding.  well.........i remember when snowball's tag used to have my name and my cousin's name...but eventually my name came off!  i was sad but that's what i had to do!    well, ever since that experience w/ the pit bulls, i got traumatized.  i will never walk coach or any other dog by myself.  and when i'm with someone, i will never hold the leash!  i told andy that before we got coach.  so, he totally understands.  that experience really changed me cuz i was never as scared before.  well, to paint another picture, i think that experience traumatized snowball as well.  he kinda got mean.  he had a hard time trusting people!  since he knew me before that accident, he was never mean to me.  it was just the people he didn't really know....like andy!  one time he snapped at him!  hehe.      i remember when my uncle died (oct. 13, 1999).  i went out to the backyard for some time to myself and to see snowball.  well, my cousin was out there too and we had a little talk.  we were just wondering if snowy knows that my uncle had passed away.  i guess we both agreed that he probably had a sense!  for some reason, i remember that.  ....and now to think that this day has come!    anyway, here's what happened.  snowy was crying sometime during the night but my aunt was too scared to go outside.  around 4am, he was crying even more so my auntie went to check up on him.  when she saw him, she noticed that he was different.  he wasn't able to walk on his 2 front paws.  my cousin came over and they brought him to the doctor.  the reason why he couldn't walk was cuz he was paralyzed.  he had a stroke!!!  the doctor said that he was in so much pain and suggested that they put him to sleep.  after all, he was old.  so, yeah that's what happened.  they put him to sleep around 11am.  i found out cuz during lunch, i wanted to visit my parents.  well, when i got there, no one was there so i got stuck eating in my car.  my aunt lives across the street and i decided to call her to ask if she knows where everyone's at.  at that time, she told me that she had bad news....that snowball died!  i was so shocked...but in a way i was dreading/expecting the day to come since he's so old and he's been getting sick.  my aunt was sad!  =(  well, after i got off the phone w/ her, i called andy.  i told him the news and all of a sudden i just started crying!  so, i was crying while driving back to work.  it's a little hard.  things will be different.  i will surely miss him!    hehe...i can sure remember a lot of moments w/ that dog!  when he was a house dog a long time ago, he had a poop accident.  my aunt got mad and ever since then, when we would point and ask him "what's that?" he would look away and walk away slowly.  hehe...so cute.  at one point, he got spoiled and he wouldn't eat his food unless it had barbecue sauce on it.  so, yeah...i can't believe he's gone!  bye snowy!

      hehe...can you believe i'm still up?  man...i'm not blogging as much as i'd like.  still haven't had enough time.   anyway, i guess i'll just blog about this weekend.  well, first on friday, andy and i decided to go to pala.  i had fun!  we won just a little so i was glad!  hehe.  andy and i have been looking around for steam vacs and we finally found one.  andy went to go pick it up saturday morning at best buy.  we already started to use it.  we just steam vac'd one section of our condo!  hehe.  we didn't get to do much since we had things to do that day.  well, for some reason, andy decided to get coach groomed at petsmart (for the first time).  when we dropped her off, we decided to look at the fish tanks over there.  they were on the pricey side to we decided to check out a fish store that was pretty close to our house.  i found a nice tank w/ a cute stand.  andy decided to get it since he just received a bonus from work not to mention his nice tax return!  hehe.  yeah....he deserves it.  he's been wanting a tank for so long.  we picked up all the accessories but we weren't able to pick up the actual tank and stand until later today (this morning).  we had to go to andy's friend's house for a lil get-together.  well, yeah, we're just trying to purchase things for our house just to make it nicer.  we also finally got plants (umm...i don't know if i ever mentioned that in my previous blog).  oh well.  anyway, i know i'm just blabbing away with some nonsense!  i'm sleepy.

      lately i haven't had time to blog! :(    okay, if i can remember...  friday i met andy at the auto shop.  i was bringing in my car to get something fixed so basically he was picking me up.  we ended up going to disneyland and disney california!  it was fun!  we stayed there till it closed.  the following morning, andy brought his car to the auto shop to swap cars.  he needed to get his car fixed.  i guess we realized that it was important to maintain our cars so it'll last longer and so we don't have to pay as much money to get it fixed later on.  haha!  well, later on we went to ikea just to look around.  and what happened?  we see this patio set furniture thing that'll be perfect in our balcony area.  it was on sale too.  haha...we ended up getting it.  after we got back, andy went to coldstone w/ kristina and joey.  they ended up bringing back 1 pint for me!  how sweet!  well, it was a good thing they went cuz they had an anniversary sale.  everything was half off!!!  what a deal.  sunday...such a relaxing day!  i got to hang out on our new patio set!  hehe.  monday...such a rainy day.  i had a bad day at work.  i had to drop andy off at his work since his car was still being worked on.  anyway, i basically had a confrontation with my boss that day.  actually, she called me while i was driving on my way to pick andy up.  anyway, whenever i try to explain myself, she hardly ever gives me the chance.  she always interrupts...and that frustrates me cuz i can never get my point across.  that's not right cuz otherwise, she'll always think she's right...and that's not always true!  anyway, monday when (again) i was trying to explain myself, she interrupts!  i finally say something like, can you let me finish cuz you always interrupt me and i can never get my point across!  well, the only thing she probably heard was, can you let me finish?  cuz right after that, she got so upset!  well, after a while, we finally got off the phone and i was so upset...i started crying!  yup, that's good, driving and crying in the rain!  she just kept talking and talking and i just chose to not say anything anymore.  i wasn't sure if it wasn't worth it.  she knew i was mad though.  at least i would acknowledge what she was saying but i didn't that day.    the following day, we had a long talk!  it was a good one i guess.  i felt good to be able to tell her the way i felt.  but at the beginning, she was just doing all the talking and i wasn't saying much.  i wouldn't want her to interrupt me again.  the whole time she was talking, i was still upset from the day before.  i was teary eyed but i didn't really wanna give her the satisfaction in knowing that she made me cry.  so, after a while, she said that she was able to say whatever she needed and she doesn't want me to leave until i say some things!  well, at that moment, i just broke down and cried in front of her.  i could tell she felt bad for me and i guess a little surprised!  i told her mostly everything.  how she frustrates me, is rude, never lets me explain myself...blablabla.  well, she admitted that she gets frustrated and she wants to be able to let things out especially after coming out of meetings with the president....or other high people w/in the company.  doesn't that mean she's just trying to be a big wig?  since she's my boss, she thinks she's able to say whatever she wants to say just cuz she's one of the highest people in the department?  but when she's with "the other" high people, she's quiet?  that's not right!  well, i was bringing up some instances and she realized she was on the wrong!  i was surprised.  she promised that she'll be more cautious of what she's doing!  apparently, i wasn't the only one to bring this up to her!  well, i left her office...feeling better about the situation but yearning more and more to find a different job!  i kinda have a different attitude about this job now!  i'm not really looking at both the director and manager the same.  i think they are backstabbers.  i've been here for a while and whenever there's drama going on (about a staff's performance) or whatever, pretty much everyone knows about it.  it's not like they go around to tell everyone but they are so loud that we can't help it.  so, yeah, i feel sorry for the people that they talk about.  i've never said anything but i don't think that's right!  that's something that should be kept private!  so, therefore, i think everyone knows that there was something up between me and the manager!  i guess that's also a reason why i feel uncomfortable.  but maybe i'm just sensitive!  who knows?!  so, that's it for my job at the moment.  currently looking for jobs!  any hookups?!  so, after work, i kinda felt like going out!  and what do you know?!  andy asked if i wanted to go to hooters with his friends to watch the laker game!  i met everyone up at the new hooters near disneyland!  it was cool.  i had fun...even though i had to ask andy who won!  hehe...yeah i didn't really watch the game...not into it!  i just wanted to go cuz i've never gone there before!  besides, i hear a lot of people talking about the chicken wings!  the first batch that we got weren't really good!  but by the time everyone else got there, we ordered 50 pieces...and that was yummy!  i would go there just for that!  hehe...and their drinks aren't that pricey either!  yay...i found a hangout!    well, i guess this will be all for now.  i'm at work right now and i can't wait to get home.  actually, i've been blogging on and off today.  so, don't worry...i'm not blogging the whole time i'm at work!  hehe.

      wow...i just did my first free and clear (smoking cessation) 4 month follow-up call and this person was actually smoke-free!  i've never had that.  the rest of my follow-up's never quit and they would be so rude on the phone with me!  well, this one was different.  she was so nice to me but she kept talking on and on and on!  hehe...it's cool though.  at least she's doing good now!  =)

      i don't think it's really an excuse but i haven't had time to look for a job!  by the time i get home, i'm tired and i end up going to sleep early.  ya...i don't work till 9am but i'm not much of a morning person.  i can't wake up just to look for a job or do my errands or even clean up my house.  i'm the type of person who wakes up, gets ready, and goes to work.  i feel guilty cuz i seem to do my work here pretty fast and i realize i have to pace myself.  if not, i'll just get bored and get even more depressed about not having a "real" full-time job.  well, i'm poor now cuz of my stupid car.  it basically/practically took over my whole paycheck.  i was thinking of going across the street to the post office to pick up a stamp booklet!  haha...i decided not to cuz i don't want any of my checks to bounce!  hehe...yup...i have it bad right now.  at least i get paid this friday!  yipee!  we're planning to go to disneyland w/ my brother.  oh yeah...another reason i guess i'm depressed is cuz my sis-n-law just got her job.  she's been working as a nurse at ucla (not harbor-ucla) but she went back to school to get her master's.  after searching for a while, she finally found her nurse practitioner job!  i've always looked up to her...all the good grades/good jobs!  but i guess i'm not like her!  oh well.  i asked her for interview tips.  i've had a few interviews already and whenever i leave, i feel good!  i usually feel that i answered the questions right--whatever they wanted to hear!  i would think i made myself look good.  i guess not!  oh well.  anyway, i gotta go.  my mommy asked me to go to her house for lunch!  hehe...let's just hope/pray that i don't get stuck like last time.  i better make it back to work!  hehe.

      so, jaedine was born yesterday (april 6, 2003).  she's another pretty baby! hehe.  she ended up giving birth around 4am.    we finally were able to get our oil changed!  hehe...it's been a while...considering the amount of driving that i do!  after that, we just went to wal-mart and had lunch at mcdonalds.  so, we called to see if the baby was born and sure enough, she was born.  andy and i decided to visit again.  this time i didn't hold the baby.  his friend joey kept asking me why not and i just didn't feel like it!  he kept thinking that i was scared but i told him that even if i was scared, i'd still hold the baby even if...just like what i did with grace's baby.  well, he just kept pushing the idea and he was kinda getting on my nerves.  i guess it's cuz since i kept saying no so many times, the mom might think i didn't like her baby.  hehe...that was just my theory!  well, that's not the case cuz i think she's cute!  after a while, i was all like, "how many times do i have to tell you?  do you NOT get it?"  hehe.  after a while, we just went home and just hung out!  yay!!!  well, supposedly mommy and baby will get to go home today.  yay for that too!

      friday it was andy's friend's mom's bday!  well, they invited us to go out to dinner with them.  i ended up meeting them there since i came straight from work.  i figured that i wouldn't enjoy the food since we couldn't eat meat that day!  but the food was so good.  we ate at a chinese restaurant called ten-ten.  after dinner, we just went home.  i kinda wanted to watch a movie since the idea came up...but i guess no one else wanted to go.  well, it was still cool seeing everyone!  i haven't even seen melinda (who moved to arizona) for a long time!  oh yeah...we just went to cold stone!  yummy...but i can never finish those things!  hehe.  the following day, saturday, i had to go to a bridal shower.  it was kinda weird cuz we were invited but we didn't even know the bride-to-be.  that's the only reason why we didn't think we should go but my mom wanted us to.  so, i went to melani's house and from there, we picked up my cousins (melody and darlene).  when we got there, we got worried cuz we were late and it seemed like there wasn't that many people over there!  hmm...also when we got there, the celebrant wasn't even there.  hehe...another thing was that i don't know if they were prepared with bridal shower games cuz they went up to one of my cousins and asked her to be in charge of it!  WHAT?  at least they gave her some notice...NOT!  hehe.  well, she just figured out what games to do and told another person to do it cuz we had to leave.  it was kinda sad...but they started the party late and melani had another party to go to the same night.  so, we just had to go!  oh well.    we got back to my bro's house and from there i went to visit another friend at the hospital in anaheim.  she's there cuz she's trying to have her baby.  yup...another pregnant girl.  her due date was the end of march or april 2.  she has 2 due dates cuz she had one in san jose and another due date from southern cali.  hehe.  she was with us last night at the restaurant and i would just be talking to one of the other girls, and i would just see her pass us up.  she was such a fast walker.  i guess she really wanted to get the baby outta her!  hehe.  well, last night she said that she started to have contractions.  she didn't get to the hospital until sometime this afternoon.  unfortunately, the baby hasn't come out yet.  when i got there, everything was calm!  i was all like...no baby yet?  she ended up having an epidural!  hehe . poor thing cuz she was so hungry but she couldn't eat anything.  well, we were also hungry so we told her that we'd be back after getting something to eat.  so, she asked us to get her a popsicle for her if we find one.  hehe.  well, by the time we got back to her room, they gave her oxygen.  apparently, while we were gone, they broke her water!  at that time, she was 7...but it still didn't seem like she was gonna have it soon.  she was so tired so we just left to let her get some sleep.  she'll probably end up having the baby early this morning.  oh well.  i was kinda sad cuz i was hoping i'd see another newborn baby!  hehe...maybe tomorrow.  YAY!    so, we just got home and i finished the rest of my cold stone icecream!  good nite!

       happy birthday to  baby gavin!!!   yup...grace and tony's baby boy was born today at 10:20am!  haha...at first i wasn't sure it was true!  that's cuz about a week ago, grace called and just said she gave birth!  i got so excited but of course she was kidding.  and then on april fool's day, she text me saying she gave birth!  of course i didn't fall for that but that's why i had to basically question today!  hehe.  lynce told me that grace was in the hospital but also didn't know if it was true.  so, i called tony to see what's going on!  sure enough...he told me the time, length, and weight of baby gavin!  hehe.  so, we wanted to go visit them at the hospital.  after work, i went to my parent's house for a bit and then andy and i headed to the hospital.  no one was there except for tony at the time we got there.  the baby was just sleeping but i wanted him to wake up!  grace was asking if i wanted to hold the baby but i was a little scared.  so, we just talked about what happened and everything!  and then tony's sister called saying that she's on her way.  at that time, i wanted to hold gavin cuz once a lot of people get there, i would probably lose my opportunity!  so, yup, i got to hold the precious baby!  he's so cute!  i know we always say that every baby is cute but in reality, they are just babies who are wrinkled or whatever!  well, gavin is honestly a cutie!  i'm so freakin' happy for them!  i can't wait to see the baby more and more!  hehe.  so, yeah that's my story for today.

      FUCK FUCK FUCK!  just had to let that out!  yesterday andy and i went to pick up my car.  i drove my bro's car while he was test-driving my car.  well, andy's a laid-back kind of guy so if he says that it's kinda hard to turn the steering wheel...then that basically translates to "you can't turn the damn thing!"  so, ya that scared me and i got more stressed out.  i already spent almost $800 and we probably got ripped off!!!  andy still ended up going to the clippers game w/ my bro, cousin and dad.  i was supposed to take my mom to work but i didn't want to anymore since i wouldn't feel safe in my car.  i almost cried!!!  well, my cousin ended up coming home and he was able to take my mom to work.  he also took a look at my car and he said that if i left my car at the house, he would take it to other mechanics.  the previous person that we went to said that i needed to replace my steering pump.  so, that's what they did but my cousin said that he wasn't going to pay him until the car works better.  so, what happened?  they replaced the pump and it was still doing the same thing!  thank god we didn't have to pay!  basically, my car still isn't working.  my cousin is probably gonna take it to the mazda dealer or specialist to figure out what's wrong.  so sad!!!  andy's gonna have to take me to work tomorrow.  that means, we have to leave here by 5am.  yuck!  anyway, the person i report to at work called me today to ask me a few questions.  the previous person that had the position that i'm at right now told me that she didn't like m__a.  i've always wondered why cuz she seemed so nice.  well, gloria told me that she's really nice on the outside but when she puts you behind closed doors, she basically makes you feel dumb.  hmm..i couldn't picture that.  she may seem like a ditz, a baby, and an airhead but she never made me feel dumb.  hehe.  whoops...i hope no one from work will read this.  hehe.  well, after being at this position for a while, i see all that.  i really don't like her anymore.  she's so freakin' irritating.  she's not fat or anything but for some reason, she's always running around in the office and she stomps her feet so loud and basically causes an earthquake.  i'm like..."calm down!"  haha.  well, the big reason i don't like her anymore is cuz when she talks to you about an issue or whatever, she'll talk OVER you.  i've had to raise my voice a few times just so she can hear me.  it just frustrates me!  well, today during our conversation, she did the same thing.  i would try to talk and she'd listen maybe a fraction of a second and then she'll say her crap again.  so, i tried to do the same thing but i guess she always over-powers me.  anyway, when she was talking, i was trying to talk at the same time (just like what she does) so basically we never hear each other.  also, when she was talking, i still attempted to try to get my point across...still at the same time she was talking but i would kinda lose track of what i was saying cuz her voice was so freakin' loud.  i ended up just saying "blablablablablablablablablablablabla" while she was talking and of course since she doesn't really listen to the other side, she didn't hear me!  haha.  well, i don't like her and everytime i see her, i wanna leave more and more.  so what did i do today?  i updated my resume and i created about 10 cover letters.  it probably wont do any good since i've been having bad luck on my job searches.  oh well

      i broke down!!!  yesterday, i ended up eating rice!  i guess i gave in cuz of all the stress!  i even ate at L&L's last night in cypress.  yummy!  andy is still going strong with not eating meat during lent.  oh well.  i'm weak and he's strong!    anyway, today i get to pick up my car.  there's still work that needs to be done.  however, it takes 2 more days to special order that piece of crap!  i just can't afford not having a car.  the guy said that the car will still be okay...except that the steering will be just a bit harder.  that's why we're planning on bringing it back this weekend.  at least i'll still have a car for work.  i'm kinda scared but we'll see what happens.  andy says that i probably wont even notice because it's only harder to steer when you're not stepping on the gas.  i know..weird!    today my bro let me take his car to work so i ended up spending the night at LB.  before andy dropped me off, we stopped by target.  we wanted to try to exchange some dvd's.  andy ended up getting saving private ryan and i got brown sugar.  i kinda wanted to wait until today since it's tuesday and that's when they come out with new releases.  but andy didn't want to.  so, last night, my bro and i watched brown sugar.  i guess the first half was good but the last half was so dragging!  i should've just gotten maid in manhatten.  oh well.    today i can't wait to pick up my car and go home.  andy will be going out with my brother to a clippers game.  also, tonight is the last episode of real world...las vegas!  haha...yup i got so into that show!  i'm kinda sad that the show will be over!  =(  i'm gonna miss it!  there's so much to watch today!  real world and american idol.  well, i'm not into american idol as much as mtv.  but i still enjoy them performing as well as hearing the judges' comments.    well, i'm here at work right now so i better get going!

      oh yeah, i forgot to mention something.  on sunday, we had a get together for my cousins' birthday.  my auntie mentioned that andy and i should get married in hawaii.  i dunno why...but a lot of my relatives say that to us.  another thing is that when andy and i went to hawaii a while back, his family said the same thing!  they also want us to get married in hawaii....i can understand his side of the family cuz his family is huge over there...but why would my relatives say that from cali?  hehe...it's cuz they wanna have an excuse to go to hawaii!  well, i told my auntie (sarcastically) that i would be happy to get married over there!  they were asking when and i just said next year!  i was telling everyone that i'll have it next year since a lot of my relatives have to go to hawaii next year anyway for a family reunion!  that'll cut the cost cuz they'd only have to pay for their tickets once!  hehe...everyone started laughing and thanking me for being considerate in cutting the costs!  hehe...it was just all funny.  andy was hanging out with my other cousins so he didn't hear the conversation.  when he came into the area i was at, my cousins told him that he needs to be informed that he's getting married next year!  i even had volunteers in helping me with the wedding favors and my cousin said he'd even do my invitation!  hehe.  whoa....what a dream!  =D

      finally...i'm back!  hehe...well, i just haven't been in the mood to blog lately!  oh well.  andy and i actually had our own barbecue on memorial day!  hehe.  we were actually supposed to watch a movie w/ his friends but just decided to stay home instead and have a barbecue.  so, andy did his marinade thing and i decided to make some tempura mix for the shrimp, mushrooms, and zucchini!  it actually turned out to be really good!  not just the tempura but the barbecue that andy did!  oh ya, we had some corn too!  i think that was the best barbecue we've ever had!  actually this would be the first one we've had alone!  we usually have a barbecue with other friends.  too bad our barbecue's with people never turned out as good as this one did!  hehe.    a few days ago, andy and i went on a spontaneous run to fry's electronics.  it was okay though cuz i really needed some ink for my printer.  i also needed some paper cuz i was making my nephew's invitation.  well, we got there and we ended up buying some of the components needed to build another computer!  all we need to buy is the memory and case!  i finally got a bigger hard drive!  hehe.  so, we went on looking for my ink and decided to look at printers.  andy fell in love with the canon i950.  i didn't really wanna spend that much on a printer but he thinks it's really worth it!  the printer that i have right now is an epson but i'm leaning toward getting a canon.  did you know that the black ink cartridge is around 6 bucks?  the colored ones come separately so you don't have to replace the whole cartridge and that costs about 11 bucks.  we will probably end up getting a new printer but i was looking at the model lower than the one andy wants.  andy can't really justify his reason for getting the expensive one cuz i'm the one that usually prints.  i used my epson a lot for printing out my pictures!  and it works really well!  oh ya, i'm making invitations for my nephews birthday so i printed out about 24.  well, remember when i said i bought a new ink cartridge?  well, after printing out those invitations, my cartridge became empty!  that has never happened that fast before.  the invitation was basically a larger yu-gi-oh card with the informaton!  i didn't think it should've used up that much ink!  oh well.  i ended up just forwarding the file to my cousin...who is a graphic artist.  he'll be able to print it out...probably with better quality.   oh well.  anyway, i'm tired so i gotta go now.

      last week i was looking for some recipes (alohaworld.com) and i found mochi balls.  so, one night i decided to make it.  it said salt-optional so i decided to still put in some salt.  well, when i tasted it, it was yucky!  the following day, i asked andy if he can give it a try.  so, he did except he made the mixture a little more drier than i made mine.  i put it in the oil to fry and after a while, i decided to flip em over.  well, it kinda exploded and i got scared so i didn't wanna do it anymore.  hehe...i get sensitive in the kitchen cuz i get scared easily.  so, andy went over to the pot and when he got there, there was a super large explosion and what happen?  a big glob of hot oil went all over andy's forearm.  he screamed and immediately put it under running cold water.  while he was doing that, the explosions were still going on!  the balls were popping out of the pot and onto the floor!  it was crazy.  i felt like we were in an i love lucy episode.  one of the balls actually exploded on top of our "overhead" microwave.  well, andy's arm was red but we were just hoping that it wouldn't get all blistery!  i asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital but he didn't want to.  the next morning, andy woke up with little blisters all over his arm.  he said it wasn't that bad.  he still went to work and apparently when he got there, the blisters turned into 1 or 2 BIG blisters!  he ended up going to the hospital.  so, now he has to wear gauze and dressing to protect it.  he also has to put on some kind of cream.  when i was watching him change his dressing, i finally had the courage to look at his arm.  it was so nasty.  it looked like a huge tumor that we see in our anatomy or science books.  i felt so bad for him...and to think...that could've been me!  i don't think i'd be able to handle the pain as well as he does.  he didn't even have to get pain medication even if they prescribed it to him.  haha.  well, finally yesterday and today the blisters popped.  i think he's more in pain right now cuz the wound is fresh and open.  poor him...he ended up going to sleep early.  well, hopefully it'll heal soon.  he's supposed to be paintballing this saturday but i don't know if it'll heal in time.  we don't want his arm to get any worse or infected!

      may 1st was andy's 27th birthday!  =)  after work, his family took us all out to dinner at todai!  did you know that if it's your birthday, they'll give you a free lunch/dinner on your next visit within the next 3 months?  that's pretty cool!  hehe.    may 2nd we decided to have a little get together for d's bday with some friends.  it actually turned out to be bigger than we expected.  i didn't know some of my cousins were coming.  heck, i didn't even know my mom was coming!  since my mom was there, andy called his parents to come over too!  so yeah, my friends were there too.  hehe... i didn't even know jason and maureen were coming!  but everything was cool.  btw, thanks jason and maureen for the cake!  without them, andy wouldn't have had a birthday cake!  =D  i just didn't have time since i was working that day.  oh well.  coach was actually pretty good with everyone.  i'm always afraid to have coach around whenever we have some kind of party.  this was the first time she was around so many people!  she did very good and i'm so proud of her.  hehe.  after a while, my friends left and that's when i went outside to hang out with andy's friends.  they were just hanging out...drinking!  i had fun.  there are too many stories of the guys getting drunk but i was never there to experience it!  hehe...but last night it was close!  that's why i had so much fun just watching them and talking about the weirdest things!  i actually wanted andy to get drunk since i've never seen him drunk before.  but it didn't really happen!  oh well.  anyway, i thought that night was cool.  i wanna have more parties more often...hehe.    may 3rd it was jared's baptism (lynette's kid).  they had a party for him at lyn's parent's house.  so, ya, we got to see everyone again.  andy and i just coudn't stay that long since we had a family party to go to.  the other party we went to was my mom's godfather = ninong.  it was his 80th birthday.  it was at veteran's park in long beach.  it was kind of a comedy/american idol show.  hehe.  all i can say was that that party was very interesting!  the dj sucked ass!  it was some old lady.  haha...i'm just so used to seeing younger guys doing that kind of thing!  but the weird thing w/ this lady was that, she'd put on a waltz song and then she'd walk up to the microphone to say "waltz."  after the song is over, she would play an additional 30 seconds to a minute of that song from the very beginning and then stops it!  weird?  she couldn't even mix in the songs.  another example was that an nsync song came on and then she walked up to the mic. again and said "pop."  hehe...so funny!

NO!  oh well...that's okay.

      okay...i guess i got addicted to friendster! hehe...it's just so cool to run into people that you went to jr. high/high school with!  :)  last night, i had a last minute slumber party!  hehe.  ya, vanessa was upset about something and just didn't feel like going home.  so, she came over.  i had 2 fast 2 furious on my computer so we watched it.  it was alright!  the rest of the time, we just talked, download albums, and played pacman on my ps2 till like 8 in the morning!  it was fun...i haven't done anything like that for a long time!  i felt like a kid again!  hehe.  so, we finally fell asleep on the couch.  we were actually supposed to sleep upstairs at the loft.  i even brought up the air mattress...but i guess pacman pooped us out!  i woke up at 9am and went into the room to sleep.  i didn't wanna wake vanessa up so i left her on the couch!  hehe.  well, she probably woke up around 9:30 with coach sleeping on top of her!  she came into my room...we talked a little...and still we fell asleep again!  haha...it wasn't till around 1pm, that we actually got up.  she had an appointment to go somewhere so i suggested she should leave asap so she doesn't run into any traffic.  so, yeah, that was my night last night and part of my day today!  i had fun.

       wednesday  wow...gavin is so big now!  anyway, i had a nice day just hanging out with grace and baby gavin!  just visited her kids and coworkers at her school, went out to lunch, hung out at her house, and then went to the mall!  after that, i visited my mom for a bit!  i kinda got bored cuz all she was doing was cleaning, so i decided to drive back home.    thursday  andy and i decided to go out on a little date to disneyland california!  after he got off of work, we had dinner and then went over there!  that was actually the longest we stayed at that park and yet, we only rode one ride...twice!  it's not like we had to wait in line for a long time...(the longest we waited was about 10 min.) but we walked around the park...strolled along the park!  hehe...ya we just took our time cuz we're usually walking fast for some reason.  andy's cousin, mona was raving about their corn dogs so we decided to give it a try!  it was pretty good...and BIG!  oh, and of course expensive!     today, friday  i didn't do much.  i woke up early and decided to go to mcdonalds cuz i've been craving that new mcgriddle sausage sandwich thingy.  that turned me on cuz i like eating certain things, ie. sausages with syrup!  andy gets grossed out but i really like it.  anyway, that sandwich turned out to be good!  after that, i did a lot of chores.  i did the laundry, cleaned, cleaned, cleaned!  hehe.  i also went to target to look for jason's gift!  after that, i went grocery shopping!  i got some pretty good deals.  haha.  i also finally decided to clean out my car.  it's been a long time...oh well.  the last thing i did was clean up the garage.  i  wanted it to be more organized!  joey, andy's friend, will be borrowing our refrigerator for a while so i had to make sure the area was clear for them to take.  anyway, now i wanna watch the hulk!

      i had a long day driving in traffic!  i went to check out the job fair at the LA convention center today and boy...the roads were so crowded!  oh well.  it really wasn't worth all the driving cuz they didn't have as many health organizations that i was hoping for.  oh well.  as i was driving, i decided to call my parent's house to see what they were doing.  they seemed tired so i didn't bother going over there.    oh ya...jason and maureen got married last friday (friday the 13th!)  congrats you guys!  i ended up not going to their dinner thingy since i didn't know about it till an hour before he was gettin' married!  besides, i was preparing for our camping trip!  oh well...i'm still happy for them!  ;)  hehe.  ya, i was able to finally talk to the married man today on my way home in traffic.  haha.    so, ya, that's all i have to blog about!  nothing that exciting!  tomorrow i'll be helping grace at her school so i get to see gavin again!  yay!

      our camping trip turned out to be fun!  we didn't get to do a lot of activities but it was just fun hanging out in nature.  haha.  we ended up leaving our town pretty late.  besides...it was traffic a majority of the time we drove there so we didn't get there till like 4:30pm.  andy and i didn't really know where to go so we ended up just going to santa barbara @ lake cachuma.  that's actually where i went camping with my friends a few years ago.  that's the only reason why i know of that place!  anyway, on our little journey to the lake, i was just reminiscing (sp) about my camping trip with my friends.  i remember having so much fun!!!  aww...i still miss everyone!  i remember kinda being scared cuz those guys can drive so fast and crazy!  i remember that night where everyone was just drinking and having a good time!---everyone was just havin' some fun and hanging out!  then i started to think about genesis again since he came along on that trip a long time ago.  awww...i still can't believe that he isn't here anymore!  well, i know i'll see him again eventually!  well, when we went before, i thought it was a very pretty site to go to!  andy and i went camping last year with my cousins and neice/nephew...and it sucked!  it was just all dry air and dirt.  not many trees and just uncomfortable for you to have a picnic or something.  that's why i suggested lake cachuma.  i remember it having a lot of grass with a nice view of the lake.  well, since we got to the lake kinda late, we didn't have a choice.  we were still close to the lake but there wasn't that much grass.  there were lots of trees and basically dead grass!  hehe...it was still cool.  it still was a lot better than when we went w/ my cousins.  so, yeah, we had a good time!  we even brought my dog coach!  we just took some walks along some of their trails, ate, hung out, and talked!  we ended up leaving around 11am.  but before we left, we just looked around the other camp sites to see which ones were pretty!  andy's friends wanted to come but for some reason, i just wanted to be alone with andy this one time...esp. since i've been stressed lately about my job!!!  i felt bad and that's why we were looking at the other camp sites so that we can reserve our spot.  we're only able to reserve a spot if we have 8 or more people.  hopefully, we'll have enough people to make a reservation.  so, yeah, andy and i definetely wanna go back one of these days!    when we were leaving the park, andy read a street sign that had an arrow to the left going to santa barbara and another arrow pointing to the right to go to solvang!  since it was only 18 miles down, andy decided to drive over there!  hehe.  it was fun.  we just walked around downtown solvang for a bit!  andy said that they were famous for their danish breads!  i kinda wanted one only for that reason but i didn't feel like eating it at the time.  so, he ended up just buying one thing and we were going to eat it later.  the reason why i didn't feel like the bread/pastry thing is cuz i wanted ice cream!  hehe...so, we were just walking around and i finally found an ice cream shop!  that snacked felt so good!  hehe.  we ended up having that pastry thing after dinner and boy...was it good?!  coach had a good time and also got so much attention from a lot of people that were just walkin around!  hehe.  while we were headed home, andy decided to take a break so we ended up going to the camarillo outlets!  hehe.  well, since i don't have a job at the moment, i couldn't or wont go shopping like i normally would want to.  instead, i decided to walk through really fast.  i ended up going into the ann taylor outlet and found shoes.  i've been needing shoes to go with my business suits so i thought this would be a good investment...only $29.  after that, i refused to look in any other stores so we just left!  i was so proud of myself cuz i wasn't as tempted as i normally would be just to go into another store!  hehe.  yippee!  =)  well, we finally got home.  we both felt bad cuz we didn't see both our daddies on father's day!  we were just so tired.  i will probably visit tomorrow!  coach is so tired too!  she's more tired than andy and i are!  well, i'm happy with my weekend!  had a good time!

      a lot of things have been bothering me lately!  i don't like my boss and it seems like we've been at each other's throats.  well, i mentioned before that we had a little situation that happened between us.  she said she would change but ever since then, things have been different.  i know i would be fake around her cuz i still don't like that little witch.  i've been feeling like she's always watching me to find something wrong with what i'm doing.  so, after a while, she decided to pull a report on me regarding internet usage.  well, she says that it shows that i've been going on the net excessively.  i made a point to her that regardless if i go online or not, i always get my work done.  besides...a lot of people in my department do the same things.  i didn't wanna mention any names but we know we go online to sometimes pay our bills, etc.  we never go into inappropriate websites.  well, even if i say i always get my work done, that was still a stupid answer to her.  she just kept talking and talking!  i really felt bad!  i felt like she was just out to get me.  the things that she was saying to me were so degrading.  the way she talks to me is a parent-child relationship.  we are both supposed to be professionals so treat me like one!  basically, i've had 2 bosses while i was at molina.  my first boss is really tough and if you are a sensitive person, you can't work for her.  well, i've been abe to work with her!  she can also make you feel dumb at times but it's always a lesson learned.  she definetely treats you like a professional cuz she wants you to keep learning.  i've always liked that about her.  on the other hand, the 2nd boss makes you feel so dumb and low!  the reason why i switched bosses was because i worked closely with the 2nd boss regarding our health education programs.  that's the only reason and ever since then, things haven't been the same for me.    so, after being in the office with her for a long time, i finally was able to leave.  she sooooooooooo didn't make me feel good so i decided to go to lunch super-early!  when i left, i was crying up a storm.  i called andy and told him that i wanted to quit.  i've been telling him that i've wanted to quit for quite some time now.  i didn't wanna stay there too long where the situation will get worse as time goes by.  well, i believe that situation made it happen!  so, andy, being the supportive bf that i have, said that he'll support my decision no matter what it is.  he knew how upset i was and realized that it has been getting worse!  so, after talking to andy, i called my boss and asked her if i can talk to her in her office again.  when i got back to the office, i told her that i've been thinking.......about giving my 2 weeks notice.  it seemed like she was shocked and asked me to reconsider.  i was confused and she asked me if i just wanted some time to think about it.  i ended up crying in front of her.  soon after, the first boss came into the office and was telling me that she could tell i'm a hard worker....blablabla.  she said many things that made me feel better.  she also suggested that maybe i needed some time to search within myself to see if i wanted to stay w/ molina.  the first boss wasn't able to stay that long cuz she had to go to another meeting.  so, she left and i was telling meda (my 2nd boss) that i guess i misunderstood something she said.  right after that, she kinda blew up on me.  she didn't wanna be blamed for something she didn't have control of and she didn't want me to bring her into it!  i was shocked with what she said cuz i told her that i guess i misunderstood you!!  what the hell?  again, she made me feel so low but that was it!  my two weeks became two days!  the only reason why i stayed for those two days was cuz i wanted to try to do as much work as i can so i don't have to dump it all on my other coworkers.  most likely, my boss wont do any of it.  she only likes to delegate!  as i was leaving her office, i told her that i'd think about how long i wanna stay and state it in my resignation letter.  since i was crying so much, she just let me go home for the day.    after that, i felt so down and low!  i left work without saying anything to my coworkers.  i ended up going to my mom's house.  she could tell that i was crying and i told her what happened!  surprisingly, she understood.  i was explaining to her that it wasn't just today's incident but everything has been adding up.  i told her that she never lets me get my point across and one day i decided to tell her that.......that's when we had our first situation.  she said that i had a verbal warning at that time.  but who cares?!  i had to tell her somehow that it's important for her to hear the othe side of the story!  she's not always right!  at the end, she apologized cuz she realized what she was doing.  oh well.  so, my mommy made me feel better!  hehe.  after a while, i just went back home and i worked on my resignation letter.  my coworker ended up calling me to find out what happened.  well, i told her what happened and she was shocked.  she was surprised that meda pulled that internet report on me!  she was saying that she should know that practically everyone in the dept. uses the internet for personal reasons as well.  an example would be...my 1st boss.  she is a divorced woman trying to find mr. right.  well, she decided to try out the online dating service and she's always showing us their pictures..."online!"    the following day, i went into work.  both bosses weren't going to be in the office that long cuz they both had to go to meetings.  i had to make sure to give my resignation letter to meda before she took off again.  before she got in, i was able to talk to my coworkers.  i couldn't believe how much they were on my side.  i guess i didn't expect that much support from them.  i just thought they were going to say things like, "that's just meda! but we can't do anything about it!"  well, a few of my coworkers ended up going to meda's office to talk to her.  they were basically telling her to look at the big picture!  is this situation worth it to lose another employee?  she also told her that if she pulled out an internet report on her, she might as well get her purse now and leave cuz you'd also consider that excessive!  my coworker also mentioned that she noticed that there is a lack of respect for those that don't have their master's degrees.  she believes that i'm educated and that we all deserve the same respect you give everyone else. i was so shocked and thankful for what she said.  the following day she brought someone else into her office and she asked my coworker if everyone thinks she's a bitch cuz she could sense that everyone was giving her an evil look!  hehe...isn't that funny?  i don't know exactly with what her response was for that question but she basically said the same thing as that other person did the day before!  i have...actually had such great coworkers.  they even took me out to lunch!    my last day was friday.  i was scheduled to work until 4pm but it felt as if meda was kicking me out.  she kept bugging me about what time i was leaving.  it was around 12:45pm and i finally said, "do you want me to go now or something?"  then she said that she'd clock me out at 1pm.  that's 15 freakin minutes!  i was so mad at her but sad for leaving.  i was really tearing.  i was so mad at her...i decided to delete all my emails and more importantly, i deleted everything off of my personal drive.  i remember them saying that when someone leaves, they have the right to take whatever they leave behind.  we usually save a lot of work on our personal drive.  the kind of things that they would need in the future!  so, yeah, i deleted everything.  actually, if they're smart enough, they can back it up but i don't know if they'll do that.  so, i was getting ready to leave and i went into the lunch room since my coworkers were eating lunch at the time.  i decided to hang out with them for a bit and i told them that i gotta go now since meda is kicking me out!  they all thought that she would want me there longer so i can inform them of the things i'm leaving behind so they wont get lost when i'm gone.  but nope!  i don't know if meda was thinking clearly!  i was so sad!  we finally said our good-bye's!  i hugged everyone except for meda.  we didn't really talk much that day and i could tell that there was tension between us. i didn't want that to happen cuz the day before, she was nice to me and asked me if i made my decision.  i guess since she had those talks w/ my other coworkers and since she knows how everyone feels, she was kinda taking it out on me and just wanted me to leave!  oh well.  i had an appt. with human resources at 1:30pm.  i wanted to let them know about how meda was treating me and possibly others.  i told them everything!  and what happened?  nothing!  she said that if i were to say something before i resigned, then they couldve done something!!!  blablabla!  actually the HR person understood what i was talking about.  she said that from personal experience, she could definetely picture meda being the way i'm describing her.  i guess she's had a hard time with her before too.  oh well.  she "indirectly" told me to write a letter to the director of the department just to inform how and what i've been feeling with meda    after that, i finally left.  i felt very sad to leave my coworkers.  but happy to leave meda.  i ended up calling my coworkers on my way home to ask them if meda said anything bout my empty z drive.  she said they were looking at it and just locked herself and the other boss in the office.    so, a few days passes by and i get a call.  it was my coworker pshyra.  she had some questions regarding my process in the work i did.  she even said, that if meda let me stay longer, all the questions could've been answered and they wouldn't have to call me again.  so, yeah, they had a meeting and they didn't even know some of the things i did.  meda said that she would call me but pshyra suggested that she shouldn't and that's how i got to talk to pshyra again.  hehe.  i told them that it was fine for them to call if they have additional questions!    so, yeah, lately i've been stressed.  i told andy that i just wanted to get away for a bit!  so, this weekend we're going camping.  today, we put up the tent just to test it out!  hehe.  i'm sure i'll need this little vacation.  i've been so depressed that i didn't go to some of my family parties last week.    now i have a head ache.  earlier today, we found out that andy's friend from arizona is in town so we all went out to dinner with her.  after dinner, i got a head ache.  i don't know if it's the food or boba i had!  oh ya, we discovered a boba place in my area!  hehe.  we tried it out and it was so good!

      my cousin from chicago has been in town for the last 9 days!  yup, he just left today!  i was finally able to hang out with him this past weekend.  he actually came over my house a few times during the week but andy and i were both at work.  basically, he would just come over to sleep.  he went to vegas and on his way back from vegas, my brother dropped him off at my place.  after that, his friend picked him up and they went to palm springs for a few days.  so, he dropped him back off at our place again.  that was friday so both me and andy were finally off of work and able to hang out with this guy!  hehe.  so, we just had dinner at wood ranch and decided to watch bruce almighty.  i liked that movie...it even made me cry!  when we got home, we just hung out, talked for a while, and andy and steve were just playing w/ the ps2.  the following day was andy's sister's graduation.  andy kinda wanted to go to the ceremony but at the last minute, his dad calls and asks if we can barbecue some of the meat for her party!  so, we ended up not going!  not that i wanted to miss her graduation or anything, but i would've been so hot!  hehe...i just remember when i graduated and i felt so sorry for the people that came to the ceremony.  everyone got burned!  hehe.  so, yeah, christine graduated yesterday from the same school i grauduated from...csuf!  so, we went to the party!  i kinda felt bad for steve cuz i figured that he would be bored.  i told him that we're not as close to andy's cousins (from his mom's side), so a lot of times, we end up getting bored.  but anyway, this party was okay!  some of his cousins from his dad's side were actually there.  i haven't seen them for so long!  but anyway, it was fun to hang out with them again!  oh yeah, ritche was there too and i finally got to hang out with him too.  it was weird cuz andy had to do so many errands that i didn't really hang out with him.  that's why i'm so glad that some of his cousins that i talk to were there!  hehe.  my dad and aunt also went...they were the first ones there and andy and i were kinda late!  hehe.    after the party, we went over to my bro's house so we all can go out to dinner or something.  well, we ended up hanging out at the yard house in long beach.  it was pretty cool.  i ended up telling them some stories about myself that i never told anyone...besides andy!  it was funny cuz i was kinda nervous telling my brother.  hehe...he was just laughing.  so, we had a few beers.  the alcohol was kinda getting to me but i just felt really good.  we didn't eat anything over there so we decided to just cruise hollywood and look for a place to eat.  we ended up eating at pinks.  it was andy's first time over there.  i was so happy that andy came along cuz he's never stayed up that late with us before.  we ended up getting home around 5am.  anyway, i had a lot of fun!  a lot of times when my cousin is here, we go out for long drives late at night!  getting home at 5am is a usual thing for us.  after that, i was so tired that i knocked out on our way back.  we finally got to my bro's house and andy and i decide to leave right after.  yup, i had to drive home.  then today, sunday, we just met my bro, sis, and steve, at todai to have lunch together...then he was off to the airport!  that's it!

      so, i just got back from my camping trip!  it was an alright trip!  it was only "alright" cuz some of andy's friends are just soooo obnoxious!  on top of that, andy was getting on my nerves too!  maybe i was just pms'ing!  anyway, there's no need to post the details of this trip...considering i didn't have a good time!  hehe.  oh well.  on another note, while i was camping, jason text me!  yup, jason and maureen have their new baby girl...melia joie.  she was born on saturday july 27, 2003!  congrats!

      friday night, andy and i decided to go grunion running! (i know how to spell it now...hehe).  so, we went...and lynce wanted to go so we picked her up!  joey and kristina also went but we just met them over there.  haha...i also ran into my dad at the beach!  cool!  what sucked was...there were no fish comin' out!  oh well.  it was still cool...cuz i got to hang out with lynce and the other peeps!  hehe.  the following night, we all went to dinner for andy's 2 friends' birthdays!  we went to a really nice restaurant right by laguna beach!  it was nice to see everyone...no one was missing--FINALLY!  hehe.  anyway, we had a nice dinner and then the two celebrants opened up their gifts in the restaurant.  after that, miles got up and said there was one more gift for patty.  he asked her to get up...and then it happened!!!  he got down on his knee and proposed...with a nice ring!  it was beautiful!  i kinda had a feeling but never really knew for sure!  so yeah....another friend of ours just got engaged! how exciting!  i kinda feel special or fortunate that i've witnessed two proposals this year! wow.  on the other hand, i keep getting the comment,  "don't worry, you'll be next!"   umm...sometimes i can get really tired of it.  this time, i got really sad.  i was (trying) to hide it from andy!  so, yeah, i'm really happy for them but at the same time, sad for me...or dissapointed...or is it scared? i just don't wanna settle for "this" the rest of my life!  i still have my dream...and i'm anxiously waiting to move on with my life!  how long does a girl have to wait?!  we've already been together for almost 12 freakin' years!  a girl can only wait so long!  besides...if we don't have the same goals in life, then what's the point of staying together?!  i don't wanna waste my time!  hehe...okay okay...i'm being a little too harsh!  i know i wanna spend my life with andy!  i guess a part of it is that the people get to me!  people always asking when we're gonna get married, when we're gonna have a baby, etc.  at the end, i get this feeling and i ask myself..."does andy  NOT  want to spend the rest of his life with me?"  he says he does but i know other people may think otherwise.  i guess that's why i get scared and/or sad.  oh well....we'll see what happens in the future!  don't get me wrong...i am still happy with this guy...i guess i just want my life to move forward!  i know that wont happen though until i find a full time job!  my day will (eventually) come!

      yes...i'm still awake?!  actually, i just got home.    yesterday was gavin's baptism.  it's kinda funny...he got baptised in the same church i was baptised in.  hehe.  anyway, it was nice.  the priest was pretty strict.  he made some points though...some i never really thought of...or didn't think of it as being so extreme.  he was strict but somehow he kinda inspired me?    anyway, we had dinner afterwards at naga's restaurant in long beach.  another funny thing is that i went clubbing with grace at this place.....and this is the same place gavin is having his baptism celebration!  hehe.  anyway, that restaurant was really nice.  we had such a pretty view!  i want someone to have a wedding reception there!  hehe.  so, yeah, i had a good time...hanging out with my girls! :)  for gavin's gift, i ended up getting him a white gold bracelet with his name!  i thought it was pretty cute!  my mom wanted me to get the yellow gold just to be traditional but i liked the look of the white gold better!  hehe.    after the reception, andy and i were going to try to make it to my neice's (kayla's) dance performance.  however, we kinda got into a bind!  joey's garage got broken into and he needed andy's help to figure out what to do.  so, instead of going to kayla's thing, andy just dropped me off at my mom's house.  everyone was at the performace and no one was home.  i didn't have the key so i had to break into the house.  hehe....i climbed through the window.  so, andy left to go to his friend's house and i was left alone.  i ended up calling vanessa in the meantime!  eventually, my bro came over to pick me up and we all went to a late dinner at norms.  so, i'm still happy cuz even if i missed the performace, i saw all the people that counted!  hehe.  awww...poor kayla though!  she did 4 different performances and on the ballet performance, she was supposed to run through the stage and make a flying leap!  well, she slipped and fell.  but she was able to get herself back up and get right with the beat again!  haha.  that was so cool!  anyway, andy was kinda sad he didn't get to see her!  after all, andy is kayla's ninang!  oh well.  she's going to have many more performances in the future!  :)    okay, i guess i'm feeling it!  i need to get some sleep.  good night/morning!

      happy belated 4th of july!  andy and i didn't do much.  we usually do a picnic at shoreline park but we didn't go this year.  we were just indecisive!  we couldn't decide whether we should go to shoreline, to andy's friend's house, or my cousin's house!  haha...so, we ended up staying home!  it was cool though cuz we were able to get a lot of things done!  at around 9pm, andy and i decided that we wanted to go grunyun (sp?) running!  well, in order to do that, you're "supposed" to have a fishing license.  we were driving all over town to find a place that was open but we were unsuccessful.  on the other hand, it felt like we were on an episode on  girls gone wild!  we basically got stuck in traffic at newport beach for about 3 hours.  it was funny though...very entertaining!  so, after all that traffic, we finally made it to the beach...cabrillo beach.  it was kinda crowded there and there and a lot of people were flashing their flashlights in the water.  so, we didn't get to get any fish.  i don't know if they were just scared.......or what.  oh well.  we brought coach with us and i still had fun.    saturday, we just visited andy's friends at their new house in long beach.  that's it...kicked back.  sunday, we went to carson for frolyn's baby shower.  it was kinda fun and yippee...andy won 2 games!  hehe.  after that, we visited vanessa for a bit and then finally visited my parents.  umm...they kinda gave me a hard time today!  my mom kept saying that she misses me and that she's lonely...blablabla.  well, i hardly ever go there nowadays... so, we finally got home!  =)  i was kinda falling asleep and then andy came home from his parent's house!  i guess his relatives that were here from hawaii gave some snacks!  yummy!  i finally have picked mango!  i haven't had that for ages!  yum...  so, andy got an invitation for his cousin jackie's wedding in hawaii.  i would've liked to go but we can't really afford it!  i just wish we knew about it earlier so we could've saved up our money for that trip!  oh well.    anyway, i'm tired!

      lately, andy has been helping joey with his new house that i barely got to see my boyfriend! hehe.  it's cool though!  so, last saturday, he went over to joey's again and i was bored.  i wanted to see his new house but i didn't wana stay there the whole day.  so, i was supposed to go separately.  anyway, first i went to cerritos mall just to look around. after that, i decided to visit my brother since i haven't seen him in a long time!  i ended up hanging out there too long that i didn't even go to joey's.  oh well.  andy ended up coming over and we just had dinner together.  after dinner, we got some boba!  hehe.  so, sunday came.  we ended up going to LA just because......and we found one of those game thingies...where you can play 70,000 different games.  it's pretty cool...very old school.    after LA, we went over to d's cousin's house in diamond bar.  there was a get together since a few of andy's relatives from hawaii are in town.  they make me wanna go back so bad!  oh well...no money!  now i'm working on a few scrapbook pages for my ex-boss.  the director of the health ed. dept. is leaving and they asked if i wanted to participate in this project.  since i never had anything against her, i decided to participate.

      so, friday i went to disneyland with my cousins, nieces, and nephew.  andy and i got there around 4:30pm.  surprisingly, it wasn't as crowded as i thought it would be.  the kids had fun...as alwayz.  after that, we had dinner at thai barbecue in carson.  andy and i weren't planning on going to carson but we did anyway.  the kids were so tired and of course they knocked out--before dinner!  hehe.  after dinner, i just went over to my cousin's house to hang out.  after a while, the adult cousins decided to go to hermosa beach to hit up a bar.  we went to the same area as sharkees or whatever that's called.  but instead of going there, we went to the lighthouse.  we just had a few drinks, talked, and then left.  supposedly, that was our last night with them...but we were just asking what their plans were for saturday.  i know that they were going to the in-laws' home and then go back to chicago from there.  they didn't have to be there till like 6pm so they asked us if we can take them to a water park.  of course we didn't refuse...so saturday afternoon, we headed over to wild rivers in irvine.  it was okay.  we were supposed to leave at 11am but we were 30 minutes late.  we were so tired from the night before.  well, we figured that since they had to leave the park by 3:30pm, once we get to the house, we would take off and leave.  but instead, they wanted to eat out.  i kinda felt bummed cuz i knew they had to leave the park early...so we wouldn't have that much time over there.  we probably didn't get there till close to 2pm.  oh well.  it was still a fun day.  it was scary cuz we fit 7 people in my car.  not only that, but some of the kids were supposed to have car seats but the "adults...or my elders" said that it would be okay!  so, andy and jt sat in the front.  lily (3 years old) was the only one with a car seat.  jane and i also sat in the back.  additionally, justin (7 years old) and kayla (6 years old) sat on our laps.  isn't that scary.  just so anyone knows...i would never do that to any of my kids.  oh well.    after the chicago people left, justin and kayla wanted to spend the weekend with me and andy.  when i see andy with the kids, i can tell that he's going to be such a good dad!  the kids get along with him so well!  they like him more than they like me.  hehe.  before we got to our house, we had to go to joey's house.  andy and i are part of ross's wedding so the whole bridal entourage will be throwing them a wedding shower.  so, the planning committee met at joey's house.  it was cool cuz we got a few things accomplished.  hehe.  so, we finally got to my house, watched tv, and then slept.  today, we spent a good portion of the day at the pool.  i didn't realized how dark justin and kayla are!  they are already pretty good at swimming and i don't even know how to float!  hehe...they wanna teach me!  we had breakfast, went to the pool (for like 3 hours), ate lunch, watched tv, watched freaky friday, went to the pool, took a bubble bath, eat dinner, watch tv, and now they're finally sleeping!  andy is too...he's going to work tomorrow.  i will be dropping the kids off to carson sometime tomorrow.  oh ya, i also have to go to andy's parent's house to let their dog go pee-pee.  hehe.

      i just had an interview yesterday.  i'm not sure if it went well though.  first of all, i was about 40 minutes late.  it wasn't completely my fault since i received the wrong directions from one of the people who interviewed me.  she felt bad and kept apologizing.  geez...you don't know how stressed i was looking for the place and knowing that i was going to be late.  i've never been late to an interview before.  in fact, i'm always there super early!  anyway, i finally found the place and i was still stressed out.  that's the bad part.  i think me being stressed kind of showed during the interview.  so, first, i met with one lady.  she decided to get the interview started and asked me a few questions regarding the work i did at molina.  in actuality, we were kind of waiting for the director of the dept. to get in but for some reason, she was taking a long time.  basically, i was in with the first lady (about 15-20 minutes).  that's when i felt like i didn't do too well simply because i was stressed out.  so, finally, the director joined us and somehow i snapped out of my "stressness."  i just became more calm and was able to answer all their questions without any problems.  after the interview, i thanked them for having me...blablabla-----esp. even after i was late.  i didn't mean to make that other lady feel bad but after i said that, she apologized again!  hehe.  actually, the director told the vice president that i was running late since someone gave me the wrong directions.  hehe.  the vice president said that it was okay...that it'll add additional stress on top of the interview process and we'll just see how she does!  apparently, the director thought i did pretty well even with the amount of stress i was going through!  she didn't see the first half of it though!  at least, i'm not the one who totally looks bad since everyone knows the directions i received were wrong!  hehe.  oh well.  i kinda doubt i'll get this job.  we'll see.    the other day, i accidentally left my car door kind of open...which made the inside light stay on the whole night.  ever since then, the car would have a hard time starting.  i'm poor so i'm trying to just drive around...recharging the battery!  i don't know if that's working cuz after driving around, i went grocery shopping and the car had a hard time starting again.  hopefully, it'll start again today.  i'm supposed to be driving my cousin jane (from chicago) around and to pick up her husband from the airport.  i will probably have to go to costco with my dad to get a new battery.  oh well.  another thing planned for the night is dinner...at a hawaiian place.  most likely the loft AGAIN!  hehe.    friday, we are all going to disneyland!  i wont be there until towards the night.  after disney, the kids will be spending the night at our place!  so fun!  hehe.

      i borrowed a book from vanessa called, "memoirs of a geisha."  i decided to give it a try.  she gave it to me when she went to my brother's house on monday.  i started reading it that night...and discovered that it was really interesting!  and tonight...i finished the book!  how exciting!  it took me a week to read it!  i'm so proud of myself considering that i never like to read books.  so, yeah, this is my first book that i've read on my own...for my own pleasure and not for school.  hehe.  it's a different feeling when you're not reading for an english class or whatever...and you don't have to concentrate on little details.  so, this is such an accomplishment!!!  now i wanna get another book that is similar to "memoirs of a geisha."  any suggestions?    anyway, friday, andy and i did a lot of errands together.  well, we just bought stuff we needed...and stuff for my dog, coach.  that night, andy and i spent some time in the pool.    the following day, saturday, we had to go to carson for my cousin's 40th birthday party.  it was a luau so we were supposed to dress in our hawaiian gear.  i didn't have anything except for shorts and i didn't feel like wearing shorts.  instead, i just wore a white top with jeans, and my puka (sp?) shell necklace.  andy had a hawaiian print shirt that we got when we went to hawaii a while back.  so, anyway, my cousin and her daughter are in town from chicago.  i was excited to see them.  my other cousin finally got to the party and asked why me and the chicago cousin weren't in our hawaiian gear.  she asked if she wanted her to drive back home (about 5 min away) to pick up some materials she had to make a lau lau.  haha...i don't know how to spell that either.  well, i didn't even know what a lau lau was but i found out it was just a piece of material you wrap around your waist...like a skirt i guess.  well, my cousin was there the whole time so i didn't think we had to use the lau lau.  it turned out that the husband and my bro went to pick up the material!  haha.  we couldn't say "no" so that's what we wore.  i felt uncomfortable cuz the material i had was so long that when we double knotted it, there was a huge bulge that was unattractive!  hehe.  so instead, i just tied it once!  i was uncomfortable for a while cuz i didn't want it to untie and have me exposed at a party!  haha...that wouldn't be good.  after a while, i asked andy if he knew how to tie a lau lau and surprisingly, he said he knew how.  so, we went to the bathroom and he fixed it for me.  he was able to wrap the material around me twice instead of once!  that was good so i would have a smaller knot...that would be double knotted.  haha...so complicated.  anyway, andy was kinda dissappointed cuz he thought that since it was a luau, hawaiian food would be served.  haha..but it was the same food that they usually serve at a party.  oh well.  what was different about this party was that they hired a belly dancer for the birthday celebrant.  it was quite entertaining!  it was very cool.....  also, my cute neices and nephew performed a few hula dances.  it was a fun party!  we were the last ones to leave.  oh yeah...that day was also frolyn's kid's birthday but we didn't get to go obviously cuz of my cousin's thing.  oh well.    tomorrow i'm supposed to go to california adventure.....and have dinner at "ariel's grotto" or something like that.

      i've been contemplating on whether or not i should go back to school...whether or not i should get my masters or another degree in a different field.  no matter what, the degree that i "may" get will coincide with the degree i already have.  that way, i didn't get my bachelor's for nothing.  so, yeah...i still have some contemplating to do!  hehe.  i just don't like the pressure that i get from some people.  oh well.  the past 2 days, i've been staying at my brother's house in long beach.  my bro and sis n law went to cancun for their first year wedding anniversary so i decided to just hang out at their house...feed the dog, water the grass/plants, and feed the fish.  i had a good time even if i didn't do much.  it was just my "alone" time which is cool.  actually, vanessa came and visited me.  since it wasn't my house, i didn't want her to spend the night, (and i told her that), but what did she do?  she spent the night.  haha...i didn't want to be mean but i kinda was just waiting for her to leave.  well, we didn't sleep until around 5am and she didn't leave until around 7:30am.  oh well...i just thought it would be nice of her to acknowledge that i didn't want her to spend the night but she didn't say one word about it.  whenever she comes to my anaheim hills condo, it's kind of a "given" that she will spend the night...at least most of the time.  i guess since we were at my bro's house, i didn't think it was right--------but unfortunately, she didn't care or she forgot???  hmm...  so, anyway, i'm home now.  i came home just in time for dinner.  now my skin is peeling.  it has to deal with when i went fishing 11 days ago.  i just don't know why i started to peel NOW.  wasn't i supposed to peel right after the fishing trip?  oh well.

      andy and i had a great weekend!  we had some stimulating conversations!  actually, we were discussing life...our goals and what we want in life!  so, what did we do?  we ended up looking for homes.  it was FUN and exciting!  hehe...at the same time, scary...and made me somewhat worried!  i'm just afraid i want all these things and wont even get it!  well, i guess that's why i gotta work hard NOW!  ya...good luck trina!  we'll see what happens.

      i just got back from fishing with andy, lynce, and jemeline!  i had sooo much fun!  we went on a boat called "nautilis" which went off from newport beach.  i caught a total of around 7 fishes.  all of us pretty much caught the same amount!  i've gone fishing with andy before but i never wanted to touch the live bait!  this time i decided to get down and dirrrty!  hehe.  i was so proud of myself cuz i got my own bait and put it on the hook!  yay for me!  i really enjoyed myself!  everyone on the boat was so nice.  everyone would get excited to see someone else catch a huge fish!  the "deck-hands" would always be watching out for us and remind us to change our bait every minute or so!  also, whenever we would catch a fish, they would be the ones to take the fish off the hook!  i really appreciated them being there!  haha...well, that's their job!  :)  hmm...what else?  now i'm just tired and kinda red!  i couldn't find my sun lotion so i wasn't being protected!  anyway, after our fishing trip, andy and i went to carson to drop some of the fish off to my parent's house.  we also stopped by my brother's house in long beach....and then finally to get something to eat.  and now i'm home.  i just got out of the shower and while i was taking a shower, i kinda felt like i was still on the boat!  hehe.  what a fun day!

      saturday we were supposed to go to a friend's baptism/birthday party but we just didn't.  andy ended up getting fitted for the tux for ross's wedding.  after that, we went over to laguna bach (?) to check out their reception site.  they told us that it was at a park right next to the ritz carlton.  for some reason, either i thought it was ghetto or i just couldn't picture it.  they said that they were going to have a huge tent.  well, when we got there, the view just took my breath away.  i told andy before that i liked a tent reception.....the ones that i saw in movies like best friend's wedding.  i never ever saw one in person though...that was my first time and i guess i thought they only do those tent receptions in the movies!  haha...i was wrong!  that place is so beautiful!!!!  i can't wait! =)  after that, andy and i just went back home and hung out at the pool.  the following day, sunday, we stopped by my parents house.  since no one was there at the time, we decided to visit justin and kayla.  after that, we visited my other neice, kalea.  we ended up taking justin and kayla w/ us since they wanted to see their cousin.  it was cool hanging out with my cousins.  they gave us 3 boxes filled with stuff!  hehe.  but stuff i don't know what to do with!  oh well.  our last stop for the night was my brother's house.  we had to drop off the stuff that my mom got for him when she went to hawaii.  now i'm home.  i'm supposed to be doing my homework but i guess i can just do it all tomorrow.

      hehe....it seems like i only blog about my weekends.  oh well...it's not like i have anything to say.  friday andy spent the day fishing with his coworkers while i hung out with andy's friends, joey and kristina.  actually, they're my friends too but i guess that's just my way of differentiating between them and my carson friends.  hehe.  anyway, i went to their house in long beach early afternoon.  we had to run some errands and prepare for the wedding shower we were throwing ross and mary the day after (saturday).  we bought a bunch of stuff...from party city to michaels....we went everywhere.  it took us longer than expected to buy all that stuff.  we got so tired.  when we got back, we just wrapped up all the prizes and made favors.  talk about last minute!!!  doing everything the night before is not a good idea.  oh well....on to the more important topic...bachelorette party!  haha.  so, yesterday (saturday) was the wedding shower.  since this was kinda a last minute thing, we weren't able to make invitations.  it was basically just word of mouth & there were actually a lot of people there.  good turn out!  the games were just a little too un-organized.  we had a few prizes left, so they had a contest on the magic mic (karaoke) and whoever got the highest score wins a prize.  they were having fun w/ that.  hehe.    ross and mary got back from hawaii about a week ago and they brought me some li hui mui seeds and li hui mui covered strawberries.  the strawberries were in a huge tub.  they brought it to the party and it was a hit!  everybody liked it.  haha...but no more for trina!  hehe.  actually, my parents are in hawaii right now and i called my aunt to ask my parents to get that for me.  hopefully they can find it...haha.

      so, friday andy wanted to go to carson to hang out with my neice and nephew.  before that, we had dinner at 3 brothers in harbor city or whatever city that was.  when we got to my cousin's house, kayla was there but justin went out with my bro to a dodger's baseball game.  since it was kayla's birthday the following day, we decided to take her out to the mall to see what she wanted as a present.  she ended up picking out an outfit from old navy! that was easy...hehe.  after that, we just hung out at her house and waited for justin to get back.    the following day was kayla's birthday party...so we were off to carson again.  the party was pretty fun!  we stayed there for a long time.  i also went to my other cousin's house to pick something up.  when we got there, she showed me some stuff and asked me if i could use it!  i'm not going to mention what it is...at least not yet but it kinda got me excited!  we got some hook ups.  hehe.  so, sometime next week, i'm gonna go there with andy and show him all the stuff!  =)  on sunday, we had more family get-togethers.  my auntie is visiting from the philippines so there was a party for her.  it was at my cousin's house (dad's side) and i haven't been there for AGES!  it was nice to see my cousin's on my dad's side.  those are the relatives that i hardly ever see.  now a lot of people have kids...and now they're going through school fund raisers.  haha...that was the most i've "donated."  hehe.    today i had to go to one of those usc buildings.  i wanted boba since i was near alhambra...too bad i didn't know the exact location.  oh well.

       happy anniversary to me and andy!!    :) 12 YEARS!   we didn't really plan on doing anything really...(saving money).  we are probably just going to go out to dinner.    anyway, there were two nights in a row when andy and i were at the pool...hearing howling noises.  at first, i thought a siren (ambulance or fire truck) was passing by...so i thought the howling sounds were dogs.  my old dog, max used to do that whenever he heard a siren.  but that wasn't it!  it was coyotes!  the night after, we heard it again!  this time it was so freakin' loud!  i felt so bad for whatever the coyotes got!!!    so, sometime during the weekend, andy was walking coach.  he ran into a lady that lived in the same complex we did.  she has a poodle named angel.  basically, that lady (dorothy), was telling andy what has been happening lately with the coyotes.  about a week or 2 ago, there was someone who let their dog go potty.  he's trained to do that so basically, he just takes care of his business on the grass closest to their door...without a leash.  so, once again, the lady let the dog out.  after a few seconds or whatever, she heard some screams and yelps.  that lady saw her dog in the coyote's mouth!  soooo scary!  i don't know what that lady did but somehow the coyote just let that dog go!  there was blood all over his neck area!  they took him to the emergency vet.  thankfully, the dog was okay.  the following morning, that same lady just opened her front door and saw a coyote...waiting!  i guess that coyote just wanted to finish off his business!   I HATE COYOTES!!!   another incident that happened...  there was someone walking their dog (on a leash), and a coyote came running by and grabbed the dog!  once again...   I HATE COYOTES!     basically, whoever was walking the dog, chased and yelled at the coyote!  eventually, he let go of the dog!   I HATE COYOTES!   andy's sister's dog died cuz of those freakin' coyotes!!!  :(   now i'm scared to walk coach.  before we even got coach, i told andy that i wont walk coach by myself.  i got traumatized when i was younger.  i was walking my old dog, snowball, and while we were passing by a house, 2 pitbulls just ran out of the house and grabbed snowball by the mouth!  my dog almost died!  i was so scared.  me and my old friend jumped on top of a car!  thank god the owners came out and kicked the pitbulls off!  so, that's why i can't walk dogs anymore...at least by myself.  and if i do walk a dog, it'll be late at night when there's no other dogs around!  so, i started to do that more often...walking coach later at night...when it was dark!  now they say that we shouldn't do that cuz the coyotes may be around!  they also say to especially watch out for white dogs!  OH NO!    I HATE COYOTES!

      friday, andy and i went to california adventure!  we just went on two rides and was already on our way home.  as we were leaving, we ran into my old jr. high/high school friend...ralph fontela.    i kinda know how to swim now! :) andy and i have been hanging out at the pool 4 nights in a row!  i used to be scared.  i always wanted to stay next to the wall of the pool.  so, andy decided to get me a boogie board.  hehe.  i think that's what helped me get over my fear cuz i was able to hang out in the middle of the pool.  on saturday, i wanted to get goggles so i can keep my eyes open under water.  we went to chics in yorba linda.  that place is really an outlet...w/ really CHEAP stuff.  unfortunately, they didn't have goggles.  the good part is...i bought a ROXY bikini bottom for $1.97.  how cool is that?  hehe.  we ended up getting my goggles at sportmart.  after that, we decided to check out the filipino fair in san pedro.  it was pretty cool.  we didn't get to stay that long cuz we had to go to my bro's house for a birthday party.  anyway, we wanted to get my neice, kayla one of those pinay shirts for her birthday.  too bad i forgot my wallet.  hehe.  so, we were off to my bro's house.  they had some pretty good food!  my brother is having fun with his barbecue grill!  so yummy.  after the party, we went home and then went back to the pool.  hehe.    sunday (today) we woke up late.  i'm taking a computer class and a spanish class so i wanted to check borders out to see if the books were cheaper there (plus i had a gift card).  i found it on their website but i didn't find it at the actual store.  i also had to go to the bank to deposit some money...and what happened?  the freakin' atm ate my card!  i have to go to that bank to see if i can get it back.  so sad.  since the bank was at the same plaza as chicks, i decided to check it out again!  hehe....i ended up buying a ralph lauren suit for $6.  now i'm home and andy and i are going to have a barbecue!   yay.

      thank goodness for the labor weekend.  andy and i had a relaxing time.  we didn't do anything but hang out at home and just go out for random drives late at night!  we also got to hang out at the pool.    well, friday we went out to dinner cuz it was kristina and miles' birthday.  we celebrated at todai.  the following day was jaedine's baptism party.  i ended up not going cuz i haven't spent time with my parent's in a long time.  how weird.  i skipped a party just to spend time with mom and dad!  hehe.  oh well.  andy still went to the baptism while i was headed off to carson.  i went to costco with my parents and they took me grocery shopping! yay!  after that, we just had dinner at one of those chinese buffets on hawthorne.  while we were there, i ran into my ninang!  i haven't seen her for many years.  less than a month ago, her husband died.  i remember cuz my parents went to the funeral.  i was surprised to see my ninang there.  she seems to be doing pretty good for being a widow!  she's a cool and cute person!  the things she would say would seem so cute to me!  anyway, i guess i was expecting my ninang to be all sad and everything but it seems like she just accepts it!  i admire that.  i was also surprised cuz she's so different than how my aunt was doing when my uncle died.  oh well...everyone deals their own way.  after carson, i went to my bro's house to drop some stuff off.  i didn't even get home till like 2am.  i actually had a fun day!  hehe.  sunday and monday were the relaxing days spent with my boyfriend.  hehe.    i know i had more to blog about but i can't remember!  oh yeah, today is lynette's birthday and i didn't even get a chance to call her.  well, she had a funeral to go to today.  i just found out that my other friend's dad passed away and that's the funeral that lynette went to.  i wonder what happened.

      i had fun yesterday.  andy took the day off.  i woke up...felt better (as usual).  but again, as usual, as the day goes by, my cough comes back.  since i've been sick, i called my dad and asked him if he can make me arroz caldo.  umm...don't know if that's the correct spelling.  anyway, so i was kinda excited to go to carson just for that.  andy and i got there and we had that for lunch.  it was so yummy!  =)  after our lunch, we went across the street to my auntie's house cuz i wanted to see how she was doing on my dress.  if i didn't mention it earlier, she is making a bridesmaid's dress since i'll be in ross and mary's wedding.  well, she hasn't even started and the wedding is on november 15th.  hehe.  she's aware of that and sure she'll finish.  we'll see!  haha.  so, we were finally off to the wayne brady show.  we had to wait outside for a bit.  eventually we were able to go inside.  we got a pretty good seat (2nd row) but we were off to the side...so we weren't on tv as much.  oh well.  it was pretty fun.  they just want you to be loud and look happy.  i was kinda having a hard time since i have a cough.  i made sure that each time we taped a segment that i had a cough drop in my mouth.  hehe.  anyway, between the breaks, the "audience warmer-upper" wanted to play games.  he divided the audience into two groups and picked 4 people from each group.  if the people from my section win, our section will get candy.  well, he had these spoons tied to ropes.  they were supposed to put it down their shirt, down their pants, and then up the other person's pants and up their shirt...and so on....isn't that gross?  what if the spoon touched their private parts or if a pube falls out.  it was kinda hard esp. since a lot of girls wear tight jeans.  one of the guys ended up just taking his pants off...and we saw his boxers.  thank god nothing was exposed.  hehe.  well, eventually both sections got candy.  oh well.  anyway, vanna white was there.  she was actually wearing jeans and a nice top.  very casual.  she looks good like that instead of wearing all those fancy gowns.  she's promoting or endorsing these hanes sweats.  supposedly you can wipe off any stain so they squirted her w/ cranberry juice.  she just wiped off a part of it.  haha...don't know if it's all that good but she gave a sweater to everyone in the audience.  i wanted to hooded one but for some reason they didn't give it to me.  i just got a regular purple sweater...and i gave it to my mom.  the micro machine kids were there.  they were talking so freakin' fast.  i guess since they were there, they gave us a few micromachine toys.  it's pretty big.  and finally, mandy moore was there.  she's pretty.  she also performed.  i was kinda disappointed.  i was hoping she's give us a cd!  haha...i know i was expecting too much.  i just figured... since we got all this free stuff, why not add a cd?  hehe...only kidding.  well, we ended up staying there for 2.5 hours.  it wasn't too bad.  we went back to my parent's house and had dinner there.  my dad packed the arroz caldo for me!  =)  that'll last me a few days.  hehe.  so, now i'm back home and i'm still freakin' sick.  help me.

      wow...it's been the longest time ever since i last blogged.  i kinda have been busy AND SICK!  i've been sick for a while.  it started off with a cold.  i tried to take care of myself but there were a few activities that i couldn't get away from.  by this time, i should be better but my throat is killin' me.  and these damn ashes aren't helping.  my mom is kinda concerned cuz she always said that i have weak lungs.  oh well.  at least i'm not a smoker!  hehe.  so anyway, i've been busy doing lots of stuff but i can't really blog about it...mostly cuz i can't remember everything.  this past weekend (saturday), i went to a family-friend's wedding!  it was alright...  when i went up to do the bouquet toss, i ran into my old high school friend...michelle.  we ended up talking and kinda didn't realize that the bride had already tossed the bouquet!  hehe.  we both just looked at each other...knowing we looked familiar but kinda had a hard time remembering.  at the end, we remembered!  haha.    i can't believe it's almost november!  the time is going by so fast and then 2004 will just pop up!  how sad!  it's going to fast for me.  hehe.  i'm excited for this month since a friend of mine will be getting married!  till then, we're off clubbing this weekend before the big day!  i was actually supposed to clubbing w/ her last weekend, but i was sick!  =(  well, besides, trina is poor!  oh ya, this weekend should be exciting for me but i can't say yet!  ;)  hmm...what else?  wednesday andy took the day off.  we are going to the wayne brady show!  mandy moore and vanna white will be there.  hehe.  since it's free...why not?!  we might also go to a taping of that new show, coupling.  i really like that show.  i just don't know how long we'd have to stay there!    okay...well, i'm tired and i really need my rest!  i hope it stops raining ashes soon!

      so, yeah, we ended up picking up the kids to go to chuckee cheese for ritche's kid's bday.  since we brought some kids with us, we decided to get there early and order our own pizza.  well, lynette and her kids were also in town so i asked them if they wanted to go to chuckee cheese.  of course the kids wanted to go...so i got to see them!  yay! ;)  lynce also came along!  it was cool to see everyone.  at one point, i kinda felt weird since lynette and them weren't really invited...but it's not like we crashed their party...i ended up asking andy if he thought it was rude how we "invited" other people to chuckee cheese.  he said it wasn't....esp. since we had our own stuff...(pizza/tokens).  oh well.

      it's like christmas came early this year!  a lot of people probably already started their christmas shopping.  anyway, a few years ago, my family started a tradition for thanksgiving.  every year we vote on a theme.  so far we've done the country theme, the pajama theme, the patriotic theme, and this year is the college sweatshirt theme.  i have a csuf sweater but for some reason, i don't wanna wear it.  i actually wanted either pepperdine or ucla since those were the schools i wanted to go to.  i'll probably have to settle for csuf.  i have no clue with what andy will be wearing.  i'm sure the majority of sweatshirts worn will be from csulb.  that's where all my cousins went.  hehe.    saturday i went to dayton's baptism party...(jackie's son).  he got baptised here instead of new york.  i just saw jackie and her son about a month ago....they will be back again around christmas time!  wow...lotsa traveling!  andy couldn't go to the party cuz he had to help his friend move into his new house.  so, i ended up going with grace.  poor grace, she gets frustrated and stressed out with her son gavin!  at times, he seems very fussy so she gets frustrated.  i finally was able to see jason and maureen's kid, melia.  she's so cute.  it's funny...a lot of people who have a baby together would ask the other person to hold the baby.  with this couple, i could hear them kinda fight over who's gonna hold melia.  so beautiful!  hehe.  anyway, i have witnessed yet another proposal!   MINE!   yeah right!  anyway, they wanted all the ninangs/ninongs to take a group picture together.  eventually the crowd slowly vanished and the only two people who were left at the spot where they were taking pics were jackie's cousin, aimee and g.  i guess they planned that all out.  he gave her roses and talked about the symbolism of unity...and two families uniting.  he had a beautiful speech.  and then....he went down on his knee and popped the question!  it was so cool.  but you know me, i became very bitter!  haha...just kidding.  lynce and i were just asking each other, why can't our guys do that for us?  hehe.  oh well.  so, after that i stopped by grace's house and was on my way home.  i called andy to find out if he was done helping out his friend.  they were actually on their way out to dinner so i decided to tag along!  hehe.  we ended up going to todai in orange!  so, andy's friends (miles and patty) just got a new house.  it's a huge 5 bedroom house.  i haven't been there yet but it's really far...in corona.  i heard that you can smell the cows over there but supposedly they will be eventually moving em.  hmm...i wonder if that's where we'll end up moving!  hehe.  i guess i wouldn't mind.  i just dont wanna drive in traffic all the time, i don't want that stinky smell, and i just don't like being that far away from everyone!  corona's not actually far from where i am but it gets really trafficy on the freeway.    today (sunday) was jack's birthday!  we went out to dinner at joe's crab shack.  i pretty much saw everyone that i saw yesterday...except for lynette.  i barely see that girl so it was nice to see her.  her kids are so CUTE!  anyway, that was pretty much my day!  now i gotta do the laundry.  laterz...

      warning!  long blog!  hehe.  i've been so busy the past few days.     thursday:  was rehearsal dinner for ross and mary's wedding.  did i ever mention how many sponsors they have?  they have about 26!  isn't that crazy?  well, i think that's a lot!  after the rehearsal, we ate at a chinese restaurant.  they gave out gifts to those in the wedding party.  they got me pearl earrings, necklace, and a bracelet!  it was really nice.  the only problem was that my mom just bought me these dangling diamond white gold earrings...and i wasn't gonna wear em anymore....just cuz mary got us the pearls.  andy got a gift certificate to fry's!  good gifts!  hehe.  after dinner, we actually went clubbing.  yeah, my cousins throw this club in long beach.  he gave me a few free passes so there was about 11 of us that tried it out.  that club was empty!  they said it's cuz they didn't really do any promotions that week.  after some time, more people started to show up.  the first drink we had were tequila shots.  everyone did a toast for ross and mary.  it was kinda nasty...but then again, i'm very weak at taking shots.  i can never swallow the whole shot.  i have to take 2 shots...or shall i saw 2 sips.  hehe.  after that, andy kept getting us a few more drinks.  i was starting to feel really good!  everyone had fun.  i was so glad...esp. since we took em out.  andy and i just wanted to party with the bride and groom before the actual wedding.  also, because mary has been stressing lately and she deserved to relax!  after a while, she got really messed up.  she closed her eyes, and then there was a downfall!!  she threw up at the patio section of the club.  afterwards, mary mentioned that she was hungry and she wanted to go out.  we ended up going to denny's but everyone fell asleep on the ride there.  so, basically, the only people who ate out was me, andy, joey, and kristina.  oh ya, before we even got to the restaurant, I ended up throwing up!  yUCK!  oh well...it was a FUN night and i'm glad that the bride and groom had a great time as well.   friday  i woke up really early with a bad head ache.  i felt like i wanted to throw up again but it just wouldn't come out.  i was feeling nasty...i just wanted to go back to sleep so i wouldn't feel the pain.  i ended up taking tylenol and thank god, i was able to get back to sleep.  after a while, i woke up feeling refreshed!  yay.  so, after that, andy and i went to the mall to finally get a wedding gift for ross and mary.  we then had to rush home cuz andy hasn't even gotten his tux yet!  i also had to meet up with the girls cuz mary wanted us to get our nails done together.  we got it done at some place called arlene's beauty salon in huntington beach.  i've never gotten my nails done before so i was kinda nervous!  hehe.  the place looked very trendy!  you get to sit in a comfortable chair and have your feet soaked.  i wouldn't mind getting my nails done more often.  they clean up your nails, cuticles, etc.  i just wanna find out more details on the cleanliness!  hehe.  they looked pretty clean but i guess you'll never know!  ya, eventually i wanna go with my mom or something.  i ended up getting the french manicure.  mary also wanted the guys to get their nails done too but i guess they were too MAN about it!  hehe.  i had fun though!  a lot of us were still tired since we went clubbing the night before.  so, i was waiting to find out how much it was but mary paid for EVERYONE!  thanks mary!  =)  after getting nails done, i went to get some food and then was on my way home.  while i was getting my nails done, andy went out with the groom to run a few errands.  ross wasn't even done with the slide show!  talk about last minute!  hehe.  the wedding stuff was supposed to be done by thursday night...and that's why ross was able to go clubbing w/ us.  hehe.  apparently, he wasn't done yet and finished the morning of the wedding.  isn't that crazy?  anyway, mary and ross got hotel rooms.  one for the guys and one for the girls.  mary wanted all the girls to be together.  that's why i kind of got worried that there wouldn't be much room for me.  kristina and i decided to just stay at my place.  when we visited mary at the hotel, it was just her and her cousin?  what happened to her other bridesmaids...her maid of honor?  they ended up getting another room!  so, i kinda felt bad or wondered if she was sad that no one was there!  but i think she was good!  we spent time with her and kept telling her to just get some rest.  since only two people spent the night, she was able to fully relax...i guess.  so, yeah, joey and kristina ended up spending the night with us since they live in long beach.  we were getting our hair and make up done on the wedding day so i had to wash my hair at night.  i ended up going to sleep around 4am.     saturday  we all got our hair and make up done at a salon called alexander's in anaheim hills.  i've never been there before but the place is great!  it's a huge place...along with a coffee place.  i usually never know where to get my hair/make up done but this will probably be the place.  they do everything in that salon.  i don't know how much they charge though (since mary paid for it again) but i heard that they were kinda pricey!  one of the girls used to go there before she moved to arizona and said that they do a really great job!  it might be kinda pricey (like regis) but it's worth it!  i actually didn't want an up-do because of my fat face but i heard that mary wanted our hair to be up!  but they did a good job...both with my hair and make up.  yay...i finally didn't look like a transvestite!  these people are young and trendy so they know what's in!  hehe.  thanks again mary!  =)  after getting all pampered up, kristina and i went back home to get dressed.  we had to meet everyone in the hotel cuz the limo was gonna pick us up.  we got an excursion!  it was pretty cool.  all the girls were so excited!!!  when we got there, we went into the bride's room.  the church coordinator was kinda mean but mary asked if she can have a moment with the bridesmaids.  she said beautiful words...how thankful she is, etc.  it lasted for just a few seconds cuz we had to get out of there.  haha...but we kept telling her to stop because we were all teary eyed!  but those were nice words to say.  it's always nice to say those kinds of things especially since during the whole preparation of the wedding, she's busy and focused on what she needs to do.  it's nice to know she really appreciates us!  the ceremony was beautiful.  it makes me so excited for mine...but still don't know when that'll ever be.     reception  was next to ritz carlton in laguna.  it was actually really close to the beach.  a while ago, we went to their reception site to check it out.  it was breath taking...but i wouldn't recommend doing that in november.  it was so freakin' cold!  not only that, it's so close to the beach that the shuttle has to take you there.  the wait was kinda long esp. since it was cold.  they had an open bar but i didn't want to drink because the bathrooms were so nasty!  oh well.  a few things weren't as organized as it should be but through it all, when i look at the bride and groom, it wasn't about the whole reception...it was about them two.  they weren't worried that something was out of place.  they were into each other!  that just melts my heart!  that's what makes the whole wedding beautiful...to me at least.  anyway, the money dance was coming up and we got change at the bar.  andy was busy getting the slide show ready but i wanted me and andy to dance with both the bride and groom since we're close to both of em.  melinda (the sister) was wondering what we were doing so she wanted all the friends to dance with the groom.  so, we pinned some money on ross and then another song came on...it was "that's what friend's are for!"  PERFECT SONG!  we formed a huge circle and danced with each other.  the bride came in too!  it was so cool.  hehe...we all started singing that song.   i thought that was a beautiful moment too!  so, the reception was over and we needed a ride since we all took the limo.  mary's parents has a 15 seat van so they said we can go with them.  they had to carry a few things so it took longer than expected.  it was cold and after the reception, it was raining so freakin' hard!  thank god it wasn't during the reception.  everyone was so tired!  the trip back home seemed like forever.  now the wedding is over...i'm tired but it was still beautiful!   sunday  we went to ross's house for the gift opening.  i thought they were gonna have a lot of food but they didn't.  actually, they had a lot of pig and i don't eat that.  hehe.  after ross's, we went to trader joe's and then went back home.  i slept earlier...and that's why i'm still awake now.  oh well.

      hello again.  i'm doing pretty good with my daily posts huh?  it's cuz i did a lot and i guess i just don't wanna forget it.  that's pretty much why i blog in the first place.  i basically don't talk about what i think about certain things as much as what i do...when i do anything at all.  hehe.    saturday, andy and i went to LA with my aunt and my mom.  we just wanted to check a few places out.  my aunt wanted to go shopping for something she needed while i wanted to look for shoes for the wedding next week.  well, she wanted to go on her own...and it took us a while to find her!!!  geez...it was so freakin' irritating.  and that place was so crowded!  we were also kind of in a rush cuz we were gonna go to my nephew's birthday party with my brother.  eventually, we got home and i had to wrap the gift i got for jason.  the party was at carriage crest park so it wasn't too bad from my parent's house.  so, we got to hang out with my family (dad's side).  we hardly ever get to spend time w/ that side of the family.  basically, i think my mom kind of brain washed me and my brother.  but now that we're older, we are trying on our own to be closer to that side of the family.  after that party, we had another family party to go to.  it was for my aunt and uncle (on my dad's side).  one person was retiring and it was the other person's birthday!  it was pretty cool.  there was a lot of people.  of course, it's always nice to run into family!  =)  one of my  urlLink cousins  from san francisco was also here so we were able to hang out with him.  the party was good...they had a lot of entertainment and got the crowd involved.  they also had a pretty cool center piece.  they had a bowl with a beta fish and on top of that, they had orchids.  basically, the whole thing just looked like a vase with orchids...until you look closer and find the fish.  hehe.  they also had give aways with the small cute martenilli apple ciders with a small glass.  and then they put it in this cute little silver pail.  we kind of took more than what we were supposed to.  oh well...those were left overs anyway.    since we  NEVER  really hang out with the "de los reyes" cousins, we decided to do more hanging that saturday night.  michael (the guy from frisco) actually stayed an extra day just so we can all hang out.  so, after the retirement/birthday party, we were gonna meet up to figure out what we were gonna do.  meeting time was 11:30pm.  andy wanted to go home so we can change and walk the dog.  first, we met up with my brother and he drove us to my cousin's house.  we then hopped into the expedition and was off to some bar in hollywood!!!  one other thing to remember...i was the only girl!  6 guys and 1 girl!  it was kinda weird...esp. since i don't really hang out with these guys.    when i was younger, they were the "bad" cousins...the bad influences.  and that's why my mom didn't want us to hang out together.  hehe.  anyway, michael met some girl at the party we just came from and she met us at the bar.  we were on our way in but then the security or bouncer (whoever that is) saw how many guys were with us and he just wouldn't let us in.  so, basically that girl decided to take us to another bar that was walking distance.  we walked into an alley that smelled like PEE!  we walked in where there were tables that were filled and then walked into the bar/club area where it was freakin' hot.  it was so crowded in there so we decided to just hang outside.  hehe.  no one drank...we were basically just there for my cousin...that wanted to get hooked up.  hehe.  so, he was the only one inside while the rest of us were just talking outside.  back in the day, some of the cousins that i was with that night were gangsters.  it was actually the first time andy got the chance to really talk to these guys.  andy ended up saying something like...when we first got together and we would see you around, trina would hide because she was scared of you and that you would do something to me!!!  hehe.  i kinda got embarrassed when andy told him that cuz i didn't want him to know that i was scared of him.  but ya, he said that he wouldn't have done anything to andy!  hehe...sounds funny.  but andy got mixed up.  i was kinda scared of my other cousin (who already passed away).  i was scared of him because a long time ago (sometime in junior high) when i wasn't with andy yet, i was walking home from school.  i was walking home with some friends--crystal, leonard, and rafael.  well, they were walking too slow so i decided to just walk ahead of em and go on my merry way HOME!  so, they were walking behind me and those guys decided to just kick some small rocks towards me to get my attention or something.  i guess i was tired  cuz i just felt like ignoring them.  it's not like they were hurting me or anything...we just play around and do stupid stuff.  so, yeah, they knew i was just ignoring them.  as i was walking, i was passing by my cousin's house.  even at that time, i already started to fade away from my cousins cuz my mom didn't want me to be involved in gangster $hit!  when i was walking passed their house, i saw my cousin with a brown towel but for some reason (mostly cuz i was scared of him), i decided to not look at him, not say hi to him, & to just pretend that i didn't see him at all.  i guess my cousin saw those guys kicking rocks towards me and i guess he was mad.  from what i heard, he grabbed those guys, pushed them down, and was threatening them with the towel around their neck.  it's not like he punched em or anything...but basically he said to watch out if they were to ever hurt me!  umm...i guess that was a threat?  i didn't know this was going on because i had already turned the corner and didn't even hear anything.  this is probably mean, but i guess i'm glad that i didn't see my cousin with those guys.  would i have been traumatized?  the following day i saw those guys, rafael and leonard.  he told me what happened and i was so freakin' scared.  i was scared cuz my cousin was a gangster and so was rafael!  i was in the middle.  luckily rafael was nice about it.  it's not like he threated me or anything.  i basically apologized about my cousin since he shouldn't have gotten into my business like that...and it's not like rafael and them were being mean.  oh, by the way, rafael was my boyfriend...in elementary school that is.  hehe...i don't really count him as a real boyfriend though.  my first boyfriend was DON!  hehe.  okay, back to that other subject....i was so thankful that rafael was still cool about it.  i wonder what he's up to these days.  i know that when we got into highschool, he became more of a hardcore gangster.  anyway, ever since my cousin got into gangs, i was scared of him...maybe it's cuz of my mom and i was just too young to even have my own opinion about it...but i was scared of him that i've never even confronted him or asked about what happened or what he did with my friends.  so sad...so sad especially knowing that he died around the time of 9-11-01.  he died right before 9-11.  i was surprised to hear of his death, yet at the same time, i wasn't surprised.  it's the kind of lifestyle he lived.  another thing i was sad about was that, he died and then right after that, the terrorist attacks happened.  i didn't have time to really grieve for my first cousin...because the attacks already gave me a horrific and terrible feeling inside of me.    anyway, we're all grown up now and my other cousins grew out of the gangster phase...at least i hope so!!!  that night out with the guyz was crazy.  my cousins can be so blunt.  even if the way they were talking was rude, it was kind of cool.  i was able to see how guys really talk!  basically michael didn't put a move on that girl he wanted to hook up with.  he didn't want anything to happen.......cuz he didn't wanna leave her hanging!  after all, what's he supposed to do?  F- HER and then go back home to frisco?  a lot of guyz would say yeah but he didn't wanna be rude like that.  i guess that's why my cousins were making fun of him.  they were making fun of him so BAD!  it was funny though!  it was a night to remember.  we ended up getting home at around 5:30am.  hopefully, we'll have more opportunities to hang out with that side of the family!    today, sunday we went to csuf titan student union.  it was my cousin's mom's first year death anniversary!  andy and i were so tired!  hehe...my brother was tired too.  after that, we went home and just hung out the rest of the day.  now i'm done!  =)

      today, andy and i did some chores and ran a few errands.  i actually wanted to go to disneyland but we just didn't.  we went this past wednesday and i had so much fun.  mostly because it wasn't too crowded...we were able to go on all the rides we wanted to without getting a fast pass.  they already decorated the disney resort all "christmas-y."  it makes me so excited that christmas is just around the corner....but then...i don't have money!  oh well.  and finally i was able to check out the haunted mansion!  i guess every year at this time, they decorate it to make it look like a scary christmas....and based on the movie, nightmare before christmas.  (is that the movie?)  it was pretty cool...it's nice to see a change!  =)  so, today, andy and i were supposed to buy a few frames for our house @ ikea.  at the end, we decided not to---$ave money!  we met up with andy's friend's at chili's for dinner before our movie--(matrix) started.  well, if you ask me, i'm not a big fan of the matrix.  actually, i've never watched matrix 1, 2, or 3.  but i still decided to go just to go out with the gang.  so, andy and joey decided to go to the car to put our left over food away while we already go to the theater.  so, we wait for awhile.  and finally they get there.  they took awhile because they ran into a few friends--melinda and ronald.  we're also close friends with them and didn't even know they were going out to a movie.  they were gonna watch love actually.  apparently, ronald didn't really wanna watch love actually and would rather watch the matrix.  so, what do ya know?  ronald and i just swapped ticket stubs.  ross and mary also joined us!  that movie was really good!  go watch it!  hehe.  by the time we got out of watching love actually, andy and ronald have been waiting for about 45 minutes!  poor babies.  they were actually kinda disappointed in the matrix...but do i care?  hehe.    there seems to be a lot of events for tomorrow!!  in the morning, my mom wants me and andy to take her to LA.  since i'll be there, i wanted to just check out if they have any nice shoes for the wedding that's coming up.  after that, we gotta go to a birthday party for my nephew.  after that, there's another party for my auntie and uncle (a retirement party and a birthday party), and now, we just got a message on our machine saying it's andy's little neice's birthday and they're having a surprise birthday party!  i don't know how old she'll be (5 years old?) but it's so cute to just imagine having a surprise party for a little girl!  hehe.  i hope we can pack all this in for tomorrow.  oh yeah, i also want to go to pala.  =)

      yesterday i had another interview.  i, again, have a lot to compete with...one position against several other people!  i was supposed to have the interview last friday (halloween) but my throat was still hurting pretty bad and i didn't wanna cough that much during the interview.  hehe.  thank god, she let me reschedule for yesterday (tuesday).  for the interview, the lady asked me to do a presentation on whatever topic i wanted.  well, when i was in school, i did a whole curriculum on asthma for senior citizens.  i was thinking of doing it on asthma but then i didn't want my presentation to be boring.  i decided to do car seat safety.  i did my research...mostly online.  it was actually really interesting.  so, i did my presentation on my laptop...using powerpoint.  and i also brought in a car seat with a bear inside to do a little demonstration.  yup, i actually went to target to buy a car seat.  i guess i could've borrowed it from one of my cousins but i just didn't.  at least i am gonna return my car seat today.  hehe.  on my way up to the building, i felt weird.  i could just feel the people looking at me with a car seat and a bear inside...all buckled up.  haha.  did you know that 8 out of 10 kids restrained in car seats are not buckled in correctly?  just thought i'd throw that in.  hehe.  after my presentation, she said that i did really well, that i presented the material really well, and that i seemed very comfortable with the topic.  she was also asking me questions  while  i was in the middle of my presentation.  luckily i was able to answer her questions.  that made me look like i really knew what i was talking about.  hehe.  after the presentation, we went on with our interview.  i thought i did alright....it's just the thought of having a competition against more people for just ONE freakin' position.  well, we'll see.

       happy belated halloween!   i was still kinda sick but we still went to my cousin's house in carson.  we usually go there every year.  it's kinda funny cuz we're probably the only BIG group that goes trick or treating with just 3 little kids.  it's just fun going with the kids while all of my cousins just go walking together and talk.  hehe.  well, this year, i went for about half a block but then i was getting too cold and i didn't want to get sick even more.  i just decided to go back to the house.  oh well.  anyway, i read on another blog about how good wingstop in carson was.  i've been wanting to give it a try but never had a chance until halloween.  i just wanted to bring some food to my cousin's house so we ordered a few pieces for everyone!  it was really good.  thanx fellow blogger.  haha.  so, saturday i was having a surprise bachelorette party at my place for mary.  andy and the other guys were also having a bachelor party in a hotel.  mary was so freakin' surprised!  she came over cuz we were "supposedly" going clubbing that night.  she was also surprised since her sister (who lives in chicago) was there!  the surprise didn't get ruined....it's just that the pizza delivery guy and mary came at the same time!!!!  okay...am i ghetto?  each girl that was a bridesmaid had to bring a dish.  well, the cousin brought lumpia but then by the time they cooked it at my house, it was too defrosted.  when they put it in the oil, it just broke apart.  they decided to just go ahead and order pizza.  so, she called and ordered the pizza.  finally, the pizza arrived...and the cousin didn't even offer the money.  i'm probably just ghetto just cuz i don't have that much money.   well, i ended up asking them if they were gonna pay for it.  hehe......so, they ended up paying for it.   geez...what a ghetto trina.  i guess i would've paid for it if i HAD to.  no big deal!!!  anyway, mary was so surprised.  she had no clue!  thank god for ross for helping me out in getting her to my place.  at the end, it all worked out nicely.  we were all trying to get her drunk really fast but she drinks really slow.  hehe.  i guess shots would've been better.  we wanted her to be relaxed by the time the stripper got there!  hehe.  eventually the stripper got there.  he was alright.  he did his show...but he just talked too much and was being sarcastic.  my dollar bills left my pocket so fast---too fast that i actually ran out.  don't worry...it's not cuz i spent a lot.  before the party, andy and i decided to have $50 each...in single dollar bills.  he went to the bank and got some change.  i wasn't planning on using the 50 singles---we wanted to have that much just in case some of the girls didn't have any change.  so yeah, i was the change lady.  i totally ran out of singles after that first stripper!!!  and i thougt it was a rip off.  nope...i didn't like him too much.  mary was a little nervous but she still had fun!!!  well, we had an hour time lapse when the SECOND stripper would come.  mary didn't even know that a second stripper was coming.  hehe.  i was kinda nervous cuz i didn't even have anymore single bills.  i ended up going to ralps (yay ralphs) for change.  by the time i got back, the second stripper just arrived.  perfect timing!  hehe.  the second stripper was so much better!!!  he got the crowd more into it.  when he got there, i just gave mary a shot to loosen her up!  IT WORKED!  she had so much fun!  i had so much fun!!!  my gosh...what a crowd pleaser.  he ended up coming as a cop!  so, he kinda did a little skit...trying to arrest and search!  hehe.  he wanted us to do put a dollar bill over whoever so that they can get a dance.  it was so funny.  a lot of these girls were shy.  they were laughing so hard...sometimes even saying...ewwww gross!  haha.  anyway, someone put a dollar over me so it was my turn.  he was actually doing motions as if we were having sex.  i was kinda embarrassed w/ the first stripper but since i liked this stripper a lot more, i decided to kinda act the part.  i was moaning/laughing...saying yeah baby!  hehe.  it was fun.  the stripper was ending his show and said that he also does private shows...one on one.  and to give him a call and everything.  so he was about to leave........but one of the girls asked if he can give mary a private show NOW!  it cost 20 bucks!  haha...so they went into the bedroom and did their thing!  i'm pretty sure the stripper was happy!  more money!  he finally was ready to leave....he was thirsty too so we offered him a drink.  he eventually left!  boy oh boy was mary surprised.  she totally didn't see that second stripper coming.  but everyone was happy just cuz he was so much better than the first one.  haha.  after a few people left, some of the other girls actually wanted to go to the bachelor party.  i didn't really wanna take any part of that cuz i didn't wanna be rude.  i didn't wanna ruin the guys' party.  but everyone got drunk too fast.  they had their strippers earlier than we had ours so their party was kinda over...esp. since everyone was messed up.  that's when i decided to go.  the girls were actually not planning on ruining their party but we were just gonna hang out some more and get our own room.  well, we saw the guys and everyone was knocked out.  after some rest, the girls were pretty much sober.  andy was actually supposed to spend the night in the hotel but too many guys threw up and it smelled so bad.  not only did they throw up but they threw up on the floor.  and one of the guys kept spittling on the floor.  so, it worked out good ......no one stayed at the hotel except the really drunk ones.  haha.    oh yeah....for the bachelorette party we had a few games.  kinda ghetto but i had A LOT of prizes to give away.  it was so fun.  a lot of people didn't know what certain things were and we were just looking at em trying to figure out what it does and where it goes.  they were thinking that i was kinky when in fact, i had no idea what a lot of things were!!!!  ya, my cousin hooked me up with a lot of stuff.  he gave me 3 boxes filled with stuff that i gave away at the party!  i was actually considering selling em on ebay but i just never did.  some of those prizes were worth $100!  i also made these goodie bags filled with condoms, keychain, lubricants, lotions, massage oils...blablabla.  each girl probably took home at 3 or 4 prizes and they were trading things that they got in the goodie bags.  it was so funny.    so, back to the guys' party!  andy and i were on our way home and he was telling me what happened at their party.  some people get jeolous but i guess i'm different.  we're able to be open about it.  but OH MY GOSH!  i can't say anything specific in here.....all i can say is....really expensive.  =)    man, this blog is so long and i still have to talk about sunday!  hehe.    sunday, we ended up waking up around 10am.  for the party, we put coach in one of those dog hotels.  haha...i think she was at a vet that lets pets stay overnight.  so, when we woke up, andy went to go pick her up.  i missed her so much!  hehe.  i'm so glad she's back!!!!  anyway, there was some talk about having a barbecue at my house and then we all go to church together.  well, no one was able to get a hold of mary.  we were thinking that she was just sleeping or she was mad @ ross.  so, we ended up not having anything!  andy and i just ate the left overs for lunch.  after that, we were watching how to lose a guy in 10 days...but fell asleep in the middle.  we were just tired!!  by the time i woke up, i had to get ready for the 5pm mass.  andy and i are usually about 90% late.  we don't mean to but it just ends up that way.  i don't like to be late cuz i wanna be able to sit!  hehe.  but yeah, we were late again and we didn't get a seat.  but then we saw ronald and told us to come his way.  everyone was actually there!  we didn't even plan to go but i guess since there was some talk about it, we all decided to go even if it wasn't definite.  did that not make sense?  who cares.  mary made it sound like the priest that was marrying them wanted us to go to mass together so that he can talk to all of us.  but it wasn't even like that.  he just wanted us to go to church together...just because---spiritual bonding!  when we found that out, we all did a group hug.  isn't that just priceless?  haha...it was cute!  after mass, ross and mary took us out to dinner at pho 99.  i've never been there.  andy got the pho (which is something i've never had) and i got a beef rice plate.  mine was pretty good.  the pho was good too but i don't like the noodles.  so, we finally got home and rested again.  actually, i fell asleep at 9pm but i wanted to wake up cuz i have to prepare for something that's due on tuesday.  and now i'm just blogging when i'm supposed to be working on my stuff.  ok...i'll stop now.

      the morning started with us going to church at the 8:30am mass.  i was actually proud of all of us cuz we all got ready on time...including justin!  we just told him how much time he had to get ready and he timed himself well!  hehe.  i just felt bad for him cuz we probably woke him up too early.  while everyone was asleep, he played playstation till 1am or 2am.  crazy huh?  anyway, andy and i have never been to mass that early.  we ran into andy's parents at church.  they were only sitting a few pews away from us.  after mass, they took all 3 of us to breakfast @ denny's.  justin was actually talking up a storm....after he ate his breakfast.  i was surprised cuz a lot of times he wont finish his food if he either drinks too much or cuz he just talks too much.  this time he actually finished his food without talking as much.  but after he was done eating, that's when it started!  hehe.  we already wanted to leave but then he kept telling us more stories.  we probably left like 10 minutes after we initially wanted to leave!  anyway, justin is just a comedian.  i had fun with justin this weekend.  i was telling andy that he was kinda different than he normally would be.  i couldn't actually put my finger on it.  so, we think it's cuz he was without his sister.  he was more mellowed out...just a cool person to hang out with...and most of all, he didn't really have to ask or fight for attention.  he usually would have to fight for attention when he's with sister kayla.    after church, we went to my parent's house cuz it was my dad's birthday.  my dad actually asked if he can have a birthday get together with the family including cousins.  after all these years, he has never had a birthday celebration.  the most he'd probably get is my mom cooking pancit.  i just thought it was cute how my dad wanted a party.  hehe.  at the same time, i was kinda nervous.  i wasn't sure if he wanted to have a get together cuz he had some news....good or bad.  my dad is unpredictable so that's the only reason, i was nervous.  so, he really just wanted to have it to get everyone together and be happy together.  hehe...at least that's what he told me.  when we all sang happy birthday to him, he got so emotional...but at the same time laughing!  it was funny.  afterwards, he opened his gifts and he got all emotional again!  thank god he was laughing at the same time!  i didn't want him to cry too hard.    overall, the party was fun.  the cousins basically played video games.  we played both old school and new school games! =)  we played the old video games w/ like 72,000 games.  and we also played with the ps2.  my cousin got that new game called eye toy.  it's where you hook up a camera and play games.  it's really cool.  i got a best buy gift card so i'm thinking of picking that up.

      pretty good, eh?  i've been blogging more often!  hehe.  anyway, on friday, andy and i went to carson to pick up my nephew, justin.  he's been wanting to spend the night at our place!  so, we get justin while my other cousin gets sister kayla!  hehe.  like i said before, kayla and kalea got a lot of their bratz stuff so they wanted to play with it together.  usually kayla would spend the night at our place but i guess she just wanted to be w/ the "girls."  hehe.  so, before we got to anaheim hills, justin wanted to stop by a few stores.  we ended up going to main place mall.  he ended up buying himself a toy at kay bee's.  he was so excited to buy something for himself with his own money.  it was his first time!  hehe.  he also had a $20 gift card to target so we took him there as well.  we kept telling him that just cuz he has some money and a gift card doesn't mean he has to spend it all at once.  he can just save it for something better in the future.  well, he wanted to go shopping.  he spent a majority of his money.  he got some pokemon toys from target.  at least he still has money left in his gift card.  hehe.    the following day, saturday we went to brea mall.  at carlton cards, a lot of their precious moments are 50% off!  we wanted this cute one, "we've got this plan down right!"  it was so cute.  it was their last one but we just decided not to and just save our money!  the disney store was having a sale on their dvd's.  they were selling ALL their dvd's (new and old releases) for $14.99.  we thought that was a good deal since pirates of the carribean at walmart is almost $19.00.  finding nemo is $23.00 at target but when it's on sale, it's $19.99.  so, we ended up getting pirates...., stitch--the movie, & two lion kings.  oh well.  the reason why we got two lion kings is cuz my bro and i are gonna trade lion king for finding nemo since he got two of em for christmas!  hehe.  oh ya, before we got to the mall, we had lunch at costco.  they have churros now...@ least at the one in fullerton.  it was so good.    for dinner, andy picked up pizza at costco.  it was then that we found out that ronald was having a surprise get together.  originally, andy and justin were gonna go golfing but ronald's birthday thing was at that new bowling alley at the block.  i haven't gone to the block for probably a year and so i've never seen that place.  bowling is actually FUN!  i'd like to do it more often.  it's just that it's expensive over there.  oh well.  justin also played!  he's so cute when he throws the ball down the alley!  anyway, it's been ages (practically since jr. high/high school) since i last bowled!  thank god we found out about the birthday thing!!  =)  thanks guys for all the fun.

      christmas is over!  yup...i'm still awake.  i got home from all the christmas parties about an hour ago.  it was good.  this year, we slept in longer than we normally do on christmas day.  my old friend don (all the way in japan) gave me a surprise call to wish me a merry christmas and a happy belated birthday.  sweet huh?  anyway, we got to andy's parent's house kinda early.  we hung out for a bit.  the thing i dislike about going to different family parties on the same day is that i always feel guilty leaving.  it's also kinda weird too cuz we left after the majority of people arrived!  it was raining so hard.  after hanging out there for a while, we were off to my auntie's house in long beach.  it was funny cuz the kids were so excited that we FINALLY arrived.  we usually get there around 1 or 2pm but this year we got there at like 6pm.  anyway, they weren't as excited to see us cuz they were MORE excited that we were there cuz they couldn't open their gifts until we were there!  hehe.  so, we had the kids open their gifts first.  the girls got A LOT of bratz gifts!  after the kids, the cousins did a gift exchange.  i told andy that i had melani when in fact, i had HIM!  hehe.  i guess i tricked him good.  i ended up getting him a kenneth cole brief case.    after auntie nora's, we were off to another party.  actually, it's not necessarily "another" party.  it's basically a continuation of the last except it's just with my carson cousins.  so, we're still spending time with the same people.  my parents and my aunt (across the street) are included in this party...since they don't really go to auntie nora's place.  sounds weird, i know but this is just the way it is!  =)  there were so many freakin' presents!  it seems like there are more and more gifts each year!  haha.  well, if you can guess....it's all mainly for the kids.  i was actually surprised at all the gifts my mom gave out.  she usually doesn't have that much money....oh well.  it was fun.  we had another gift exchange w/ the cousins.  andy had the same person from auntie nora's and for this party.  my bro ended up having me.    when we finally got to the last party, it was so windy.  we saw a few sparks and we thought it was fire works.  well, we looked at it for a while longer and andy noticed that it was the electrical wires that's connected to some kind of box.  sparks were flying and it was so bright.  we didn't know who to call so andy decided to just call 911.  within 2 minutes, they arrived.  fast service!!  after he made that call, his cell phone said "emergency mode."  has anyone ever seen that?  does that automatically happen when you make an emergency call?  or am i just being ignorant/dumb?  =)  oh yeah...andy and i decided to open our gifts to each other on christmas eve.  i got him season 5 of friends and he got me the sephora make up case that i've wanted.  the only thing is that i attempted to put my make up in it and it was too small!  we're gonna have to exchange it to get the biggest one!  yay!  hehe.  also, on christmas eve, andy and i went to midnight mass with my parents.  of course, we didn't get seats again.  but that's okay.  after mass, my parents took us out for an early breakfast at norms.  i think we do that every year.

      so, we came back from another christmas party yesterday.  andy and i were kinda bored.  none of his cousins made it to the party.  oh well.    christmas day is coming by so fast!  i love christmas so much!!!  i'm actually getting kind of sad because christmas is coming and it'll just be over........just like that!!!  corny huh?  i just enjoy the whole season.  it's not really about the gifts...i can't really explain it.  a lot of people think gifts are really important but i don't think so.  some people (adults) even tell each other what they want for christmas just so they can be sure they get what they want.  there's nothing wrong with that but i guess i'm just different.  i just think it's pretty cool when you get a gift for someone (like for a gift exchange), you try to be creative and just think of what they would want.  yeah, i know it gets hard to think of what to get certain people but i think part of the fun is just trying to figure out their personality to see what they'd want or like for christmas.  did any of that make sense?  hehe.   sometimes i get gifts that would make me say, "what the heck?"  haha...it's the thought that counts.  all i know is that this christmas will be sooo freakin' exhausting for me and andy.  at least he got the day off the day after christmas.  he was originally supposed to work but he worked it out to where he'll just work jan. 2nd instead.  no big deal...we don't do much for new year's anyway.     happy birthday don!

        GAG GAG GAG!    hehe!  last night we had a christmas party at miles and patty's new house in corona.  omg...when i was little, my family and i would go to lancaster almost every week because one of my uncles owned a chicken farm and my cousin and my other uncle would stay there to take care of the chickens.  so, on our weekly visits going to lancaster, it would smell.  not a good smell either!  hehe.  i guess eventually i kINDA got used to it.  but anyway, andy and i were on our way to miles' place and the smell reminded me of lancaster!  we passed by so many cows!  the drive there with the one-lane streets and all the farms right next to you was sooooo lancaster!  haha.  andy made sure to keep the windows up and to keep the air circulated.  when we FINALLY arrived, i got out of the car and i said, "it stinks!"  at least you don't really smell anything when inside the house.    they have a HUGE house!  it's gonna take them a while to fill that place up!  it's really nice but i don't think i can live in that area.  haha...but you never know.  i never thought i'd end up here in anaheim hills.  at first, i wasn't sure if they'd get mad if they kept hearing people say how bad the smell was.  but they were kinda doing it themselves.  the reason why they're taking that smell is cuz the cows will eventually be moving.  it'll take between 5-10 years.    anyway, the party was fun.  i haven't actually seen these guys for a while now.  i was able to hang out with mary and melinda a little more at this party.  i rarely ever see those girls.  pretty much all of andy's close friends are couples so instead of picking individual names for our gift exchange, we did it by couples.  and what do ya know?  everyone (except for me and andy) gave domesticated gifts...home gifts!  hehe.  miles and patty gave me and andy and they got us a nice crock pot!  we've always needed that!  hehe.  andy and i had marlo and myna and we got them nike sweaters!  hehe....we didn't know what else to get them.  ya...but it was so funny that everyone else got domesticated home gifts!    last weekend, andy and i bought a new ps2 game.  it's called karaoke revolution (very similar to dance dance revolution...w/ the dance pads).  this game comes with a mic. and you have to sing on pitch in order to get the points.  it's pretty fun!  we brought that game to the party and everyone (except for me) was singing!  it was hilarious!  i think they were so loud that they blew out the mic. cuz at the end it wasn't picking up as well as it normally does!  we probably have to get a new one.  by the time they were done playing, it was around 2:30am.  that's when the rest of us decided to leave.  omg...when we got out, the smell was so BAD!  kristina and i were actually gagging!  i just wanted to get into the car so i wouldn't have to smell it and i was still gagging!  YUCK!  one of these days, i wanna go there during the day so i can actually see all the cows and whatever animals were there.  it was hard to see esp. since it was dark.

      i think i lost my tiffany bracelet!  i got that as a gift and i'd feel so bad if i really did lose that bracelet.  i'll try looking for it again!  i think i only misplaced it somewhere in my house...at least hopefully.    anyway, wednesday (my birthday), andy and i kinda started our day off late.  he woke up kinda late since he watched lord of the rings the night before.  around noon time, we headed over to disney.  we had lunch at the rain forest cafe.  after that, we walked around downtown disney for a while.  he wanted to buy me something from sephora but surprisingly i didn't find anything i really liked.  i guess that's a good thing!  hehe.  we finally headed over to disneyland.  we didn't even ride on any rides...except for the monorail.  there was this one girl i saw that had a pink santa hat!  i just had a glimpse of it and i thought it was really cute!!!  i thought it was like their red one with the mickey ears!  anyway, it was sold out @ pretty much all the stores in the park.  they said that they might have some at one of the hotels.  so, andy and i actually went.  we finally found it and it wasn't really what i was expecting.  yeah, it was pink but it said princess and there was a crown on top of it.  sometimes i can be like a princess (i guess) but i don't like showing that off.  hehe.  so, i ended up not getting it.  by that time, we had to leave cuz we were meeting my family for dinner at tokyo lobby.  i was kinda surprised cuz my parents never really take me out for dinner.  my dad gave me $27.  hehe...i know that's not much but i thought it was cute...since i just turned 27 yrs. old.  =)  anyway, the food at tokyo lobby was so good.  we ordered two boats filled with stuff.  it was actually too much food.  it was so pretty.  hehe.  all 7 of us were able to bring a box of food home.  that's A LOT!  so, after dinner, andy was tired so i just dropped him off and headed over to brea mall.  i wanted to go since they closed at midnight and everything at robinsons may was an additional 20% off.  i ended up buying two things at a really good price.    i'm pretty much done with my christmas shopping.  actually, i have one more thing to get.  there are so many christmas parties to go to.  tomorrow andy's friend is having a party (at his new house).  saturday, my friends are having a party at jason's house.  we usually have it at lynce's house but they're remodeling their house right now.  and finally, sunday we're going to andy's auntie's christmas party.    oh yeah...today (thursday), andy's parents took us out to dinner for my birthday!  we ended up going to red lobster.  it was so sweet of them to take me out.  i didn't even expect that.  everytime it's someone's birthday in andy's family, they go out to dinner.  i'm not even part of their family and they took me out!  how nice!  =)

       happy birthday to ME!  happy birthday to ME!  happy birthday dear TRINA!  happy birthday to ME!   hehe.  yup...i'm now 27!  geez...that's gettin' old!  luckily everyone around me is a lot older than i am!  =)  anyway, i've been meaning to blog but i just haven't gotten to it.  now i don't remember what i was supposed to talk about.  oh well.  right now andy is out with his friends watching lord of the rings.  i didn't go simply cuz i don't like that movie!  i tried it last year and i didn't enjoy it.  that's why i just decided to just stay home and wrap gifts.  hehe.  oh yeah, we got a tree.  we weren't really planning to this year but i guess we just changed our minds.  it just wouldn't be the same without a christmas tree.  this year my parents didn't get a tree and that kinda made me sad.  i actually wanted to buy them one but i don't have money.  =(

      i'm  SICK AGAIN!  goshdarnit!  andy got sick on wednesday.  poor andy, i dragged him with me after he got off of work to find a nice christmas wreath.  he didn't tell me he wasn't feeling good.  i didn't know so it wasn't my fault!  hehe.  well, we were unsuccessful at finding a wreath.  oh well.  i don't think we're gonna get a tree this year.  my condo is an okay size but the way they designed it, there's no place to put a tree.  that's why i just wanna get a huge christmas wreath instead.  okay...back to my other story----  andy got sick on wednesday.  he ended up calling in sick the following day.  that's when i realized, he was really sick.  andy's the type of guy who tries to act like a "man!" he pretends he's fine when he's not.  oh well.  thursday we went over to his parent's house to watch their dog.  we stayed there for a bit.  we were thinking of spending the night there but andy didn't wanna spread his germs over there.  by the time we got home, i noticed that my throat started hurting and i was coughin up a storm.  friday was when it hit me hard.  my body was aching, my chest was hurting, head was hurting.  i think i had the flu.  my temp. went up to 103.3 and that was just earlier today.  andy kept telling me to just rest.  but i guess to stop myself from feeling the pain, i would put myself to sleep.  and then i'd just wake up with the pain again!!!  i actually got bored of sleeping!  i told andy that i wanted to go out somewhere.  so, we took a little walk with coach.  that didn't really help.  a few hours later, we went to rite-aid cuz i've been wanting ice cream.  the ride there and back felt so good.  i haven't (pretty much) eaten anything the past two days.  i just haven't had the appetite.  but the ice cream that i had felt so good.  buy the time we got home, i pretty much finished the scoop of ice cream (before i got to the cone).  i was already full.  i ended up giving it to andy.  now i feel so much better.  i still feel kinda sick but at least i can do things.  my temp. is also back down to 99.  YAY!  so yeah, that was pretty much my weekend.  i was supposed to go to torrance tomorrow for kayla's dance performance.  i don't really wanna get anyone sick so i'm choosing not to go.  i might just visit my mom.  she's kinda sick too so that's okay right?  hopefully she'll take me out to lunch.  hehe.  i'm sleepy now.  bye.

      i kinda find it hard to believe if anyone ever reads my boring ass posts!  i don't even give out my web address.  i guess sometimes i get uncomfortable knowing that people i actually know is reading this.  hopefully more strangers are reading this rather than people i personally know.  haha...who cares right?  anyway, i had a very relaxing thanksgiving break!  my cousin is a dj and he was throwing a club in hollywood (citywalk).  andy and i tried to get all our friends together to go to this club.  unfortunately, i was unsuccessful with my friends.  they are hardcore clubbers so they wanted to go to mayan.  well, it didn't happen and they just ended up going to a few clubs in hermosa beach.  ya, they didn't wanna go where i was going because they didn't feel like driving in traffic!  boooo!!  it wasn't even that trafficy!  fortunately, andy was able to get a majority of his close friends to go.  we probably brought around 15 people.  my brother and sister were there as well.  they also brought a few people.  yup...just trying to help a cousin out!  he wanted the place to be crowded.  not only that, we all got in for free!  yay!  anyway, it was time for the security people to check our id's.  andy was before me and they wouldn't let him in.  i didn't even notice but andy was wearing nikes!  no wonder why my brother and a few other people asked if we had to get dressed up.  i was wearing jeans but at least i dressed it up a little.  andy was wearing jeans and nikes!  geez.  so, they wouldn't let him in and told him to buy shoes at one of the stores!  so, i asked if he wanted me to go with him but he didn't want me to.  he just walked on his merry way!  i ran into my dj cousin and he said to switch shoes with someone!  so, joey met up with andy out in the smoking lounge and they switched shoes.  when andy was finally able to get into the club, andy got his nikes back.  haha.  at least he got in.  i guess that's all that matters!  the club was pretty fun.  for the most part, the place was packed!  i had a few drinks.  their drinks were so strong.  the music was alright.  they actually played new and old stuff.  it looked like the crowd was pleased.  andy and i stayed until they actually closed.  after, i kinda got hungry so we stopped by albertos to get nachos.  so, we finally got home and i had a few chips.  after that, i decided to go upstairs to check my email.  then i said, "i'm not feeling good!"  ummm...let's just say i didn't make it to the bathroom!  hehe.  after that mess, i ran to the bathroom and let a lot more out!  YUCK.     thanksgiving day,  i woke up so freakin' early with a head ache!  i just took tylenol and forced myself to go back to sleep.  anyway, andy left the nachos we had out on the coffee table.  i guess after i threw up he decided he didn't want nachos!  haha...understandable.   when i woke up, i heard a weird sound.  i went to check up on it in the living room.  coach was freakin' eating up the nachos!  from the looks of it, she ate A LOT!  it was funny but i was mad at the same time.  i also felt sorry for her cuz i had a feeling that she wasn't gonna feel good.  thank god she had no accidents.  we had to leave to go to our family parties!  first we went to andy's auntie's house in lakewood.  then it was off to my auntie nora's house.  we ended up staying there till around midnight!     friday  was our shopping day!  i decided not to sleep since we were gonna leave the house really early!  so, we finally left the house.  i thought radio shack was gonna open at 5:30am or 6 but i was wrong.  we ended up just going to cabazon!  they had a few good stores there.  a lot of places had sales on certain items and then they give you an additional 20% or whatever it may be off your total purchase.  it was so crowded.  the line for gap was the longest.  it actually went out the door.  same thing with tommy.  after the outlet, we just stopped by circuit city, radio shack, and target.  since we were late, we weren't able to get a lot of the cheap stuff that were advertised.  oh well.  i think i wanna go to the outlet every year!  hehe.  by the time we got home, i was so tired.  every year, ross (andy's friend) has a "day after thanksgiving" dinner.  this year i didn't make it cuz i was so freakin' tired!     saturday and sunday  was when we were finally able to relax.  it felt so good.  the only thing we did on saturday was go to ross's parent's house in anaheim hills.  the whole family went to san jose so they wanted us to house sit and watch their dog.  oh yeah, that night andy made the best baked chicken ever!  i hope he remembers how he did it.  he's the type of guy who experiments.  but yeah, it was yummy!

      hello.  i spent yesterday at the dmv!  haha...not really.  well, i spent almost 3 hours there.  i have to renew my drivers license cuz it expired back in december.  i admit...i sent in the form a little late but i know that they cashed in my check and i still haven't received anything.  so...i waited and waited for my number to be called.  finally it was my turn!  i thought everything would be done and over with once i made this visit...but NO!!!  the reason why i didn't get my license yet is cuz social security put a hold on it.  it looks like they got mixed up with my last name!  it shows that it's reyes and not de los reyes!  geez...my last name is so complicated.  i can't wait to give it up!  hehe.  so, now i gotta get my birth certificate and social security card.  i just don't have time to spend hours and hours at the dmv.  i wanted to schedule an appointment but the next time they'll be available is the middle of february.  oh well...i MUST deal with it.  i added a class last night.  i'm just taking classes so i don't forget what i've learned in health education.  no big deal!  today, i might add another class!  we'll see.  besides...if i take a class, i get to put off paying my student loan!  =)  after my class last night, my brother called me asking if andy can do a notary.  so, my bro and cousin came over and andy got to do another notary!  hehe...if anyone needs something notarized, give andy a call!

      i'm at an all-time LOW!  i had an interview a few weeks ago and i just found out that i didn't get hired!  freakin' AAAAAA!  to be honest, i think i did really well at that interview.  i had to do another presentation.  not only that, i brought in real examples and also made a pamphlet/brochure to go along with the presentation.  at first, i was fine doing the presentation...but then the lady was making these facial expressions that made me so nervous.  i was just losing hope and thinking.......am i giving out the wrong information or something?  it was on std's and i just thought i was screwing up all the information i was giving out.  at the end, she said that she was surprised at the information i included in the pamphlet.  she said that it basically answered a lot of the questions that the kids usually have!  not only that, she was also impressed with the pamphlet itself, the magazine i brought in, and the presentation itself.  i got really nervous...esp. when she was making those expressions but at the end, she said that i proved to her that i am comfortable in presenting this information.  well, then why wasn't i hired damn it??!!  she originally called me regarding a health educator position for high school kids and their parents.  unfortunately, i'm not bilingual (spanish) so that plan didn't work.  she still wanted me to come in for an interview because she was thinking that she can promote one of the other girls to the high school program while i go to the junior high program...which doesn't require me to be bilingual.  at the end, the other girl didn't go to the high school program because she wasn't ready.  that just means...i'm out of that position!  i was so depressed yesterday!  i was just crying and crying!  it's been months since i left molina healthcare.  i feel so low, disappointed, and so dumb that i haven't even been able to get a job yet!  i've also been going to church more often.  i usually hardly ever go!  i'm still thankful for everything i have but i'm just so depressed.....even kinda embarrassed that i don't have a job.  so, for now, i'm just volunteering in the meantime!  geez....this was not part of my plan.  people ask me why i don't go back to school.  it's cuz i'm not positively sure what path to take.  i've always wanted a full time job cuz that'll help me see which way i should go.  did that make sense?  i'm supposed to have a full time job so i can save money with andy for a house.  we've been at this condo for almost two years.  i feel guilty cuz his parents don't want us to stay here forever.  the plan was for us to save during those two years so by that time, we can have our OWN house!  i feel bad!  i wanna save money cuz i want my own house......and by the way...i wanna get married!  my dreams aren't coming true!  =(

      yesterday, andy and i went to church.  they were giving out these baby feet pins to try to stop abortions.  the paper that the pin was attached to said something like... this is the size of baby's feet 12 weeks after conception.   it was pretty cool.    anyway, some of my friends came over yesterday.  it was supposed to be a lunch thing but they didn't leave till around 10pm...goshdarnthosepeople!  hehe...jk.  i had fun.  we ended up putting the two dogs in the garage.  it was a potluck thing so andy and i had salad and korean bbq.  lynce brought popeyes chicken.  lynette and keith cooked something up at my house.  it was so good.  i don't even know what it's called...i think it's a guamanian dish.  YUMMY!  hehe.  the girls basically hung out together while the guys were gambling!  after a while, we decided to go bowling.  the more i go bowling, the more i want my own PINK ball.  haha...we'll see.  i'm not even good at bowling.  by the time our time was up, everyone was hungry again.  so, we headed over to the house again to eat more.  oh yeah, yesterday was the first time i got to really hang out with little keith.  usually, he would be with other kids or whatever but i guess it was different since there wasn't that many people around!  i have to admit...i kinda got attached to him.  he's so cute and loving!  =)

      yesterday i went to the dmv to try to get my license renewed.  by the time i got there, it was so freakin' tired.  i couldn't even find parking.  i kinda gave up and just pulled out of the parking lot...........then i realized that i came all that way and i wasn't gonna give up that easily.  i ended up parking next door at smart n final.  hehe.  anyway, that place was so crowded!  at the end, i decided not to wait!  haha...what a waste of time.  it's okay...i was kind of in a rush cuz i had to pick andy up from work...since his car was at the shop.    at night, we went to dinner for jemeline's birthday at elephant bar.  it was alright!  the drinks were good but the food wasn't as great as i thought it would be.  oh well.  it was fun...i got to see the old gang again.  after dinner, we went to my friend's (james) house as a meeting place cuz we were all going bowling at pikes place in long beach.  so, we were there for a while since we wouldn't be able to get a lane for like 2 or 3 hours. that's so long.  we drank a little more.  some people were gambling.  james has a poker table and a roulet (sp) table as well.  lynce and i were so tired.  we wanted to visit grace since she lives really close to james. ... but by that time, she was sleeping.  oh well.  so, we finally got to the bowling alley.  it was my first time there...it looked really cool.  the place where we went bowling at has a bunch of arcade games.  we still had to wait a while till we got our lanes.  it was okay cuz we were able to get some drinks.  their fuzzy wuzzy is good!  hehe...it's cheap too!    we decided to play girls against the boys.  there were a lot more girls than guyz so it took our game a LOOOONG time!  i'll never do that again!  hehe.  to me, it's not as fun if you have so many people on the same lane.  the game will just seem so long!  i guess that's why it's worth it just to pay a little more to get another lane.  oh well.    anyway, i had a fun night.  however, i like the bowling alley at the block a lot more than the one in long beach.  it's just more of a relaxing atmosphere.  well, maybe it was just the night.  i ran into a few people i used to go to school with.  one of em, i never really talked to.  i only knew him cuz we had a few classes together...but still never talked.  hehe.  i was surprised that he went up to me!  haha...=)  tomorrow, some of my friends are coming over.  jack had the day off so he and some people just wanted to come by and visit.  we'll probably just have lunch or something.  no big deal.  good nite!  =)

      andy had the day off on monday and he spent most of his time helping his friends move.  i was gonna help but the stuff that they were moving were all the big stuff...bed, sofa, etc.  yeah, so i stayed home for a bit.  a friend of mine wanted me to go to a  urlLink world works seminar.   actually, this person has actually been in the seminar for the past few days.  i guess they wanted people to bring guest(s) to try to sell their product to us.  it's so freakin' expensive!  well, andy and i were debating whether or not we should go.  andy already wanted to go to a different seminar.  we just didn't know where to go...actually, we didn't know if we would even go anywhere cuz the move was taking andy longer than expected.  the seminar started at 7pm and andy got home at 6:50pm.  not only that, his friend came inside and it's not like we wanted to kick him out!  hehe.  well, i couldn't make up my mind.  i wanted to go to my friend's thing but at the same time, i didn't wanna go alone.  well, she called me again...asking if i can go.  all she said was...i just wanted your support!  ummm....i guess that got to me so i was gonna go w/ or without andy.  well, he thought he was gonna make it on time but it was traffic??  so, yeah, it started at 7 and we didn't get there till like 8.  it was in a hotel and we were trying to find out which banquet room it was in.  we finally found it and we had to check in.  after staying there for like 15 minutes, she asked everyone to do some kind of exercise.  i think this seminar or this company helps you find yourself and to work on your self esteem.  so, we got up and we were doing the exercise.   my friend found us and i finally got to meet her boyfriend.  well, her boyfriend had to leave.  we asked my friend what time the seminar was gonna last.  it turned out to be longer than we expected.  after my friend and the bf went out of the room, andy asked if we can just leave too cuz he didn't wanna stay that long!  it was kinda hard cuz the people who were working the seminar would stand so close to you to listen to your conversation.  i just said that i had to go to the restroom and my plan was just to meet andy out there.  hehe.  so, we were finally out of the hotel.  i had to call my friend to tell her that we couldn't stay cuz andy has to get up like at 4am.  and what did she say?  she said...can you take me home?  first of all, you live in carson and we live in anaheim hills.  hehe...i think if we had to, we'd do it.  i guess she was having problems with her bf and he's the one who took her there.  we were supposed to meet up at the front of the hotel and on our way there, we ran into her bf.  she wanted to also leave since there was no way she can get home.  but i was proud of her cuz going home or leaving would be the thing she'd normally do.  this time she decided to stay strong and keep her word and her commitment to stay.  her bf wanted to talk to us so we were supposed to go to starbucks.  by the time we got there, it was closed so we stayed outside for about 30 minutes talking in the parking lot.  i was glad i got to know the bf a little more.    after that, we had to make another stop.  we had to go to andy's friend's house.  well, his friend is getting married in philippines so he asked us if we can dogsit for him.  so, now we have a little pomerianian with coach!  hehe...he's cute.  he's a tanned version of my old dog snowball!  we stayed at their house for a bit to make sure the two dogs got along.  by the time we got home, it was 11pm.  andy was getting frustrated.  i kinda got frustrated too cuz i've never had to watch two dogs at once by myself.  if i don't know a dog, i kinda get scared.  yeah, i was traumatized when i was a kid.  well, it's been 3 days since skippy has been here and i'm getting the hang of it.  at times, i feel bad cuz i let coach do certain things that i don't want skippy to do.  i.e. i let coach on the bed but i don't let skippy.  in the beginning, they would both jump on the bed.  hehe...i get grossed out with two dogs on the bed.  i don't want this place to be a zoo.  hehe.

      hello.  yesterday (saturday), we went to my brother's house for his 30th birthday!  it was pretty fun.  my cousins (mom's side), neices, nephew, friends, and other relatives from mel's side were there.  my bro also invited our other cousins from my dad's side.  he just told them to come later.  they ended up getting there at like 9pm.  geez.  hehe.  yeah...surprisingly, the party lasted that long.  people were even playing mahjong.    anyway, that night made me realize how people can be so immature.  they can tell you one thing but mean another.  such hippocrites.  hehe.  i'm not gonna mention any names but it's several people who let pride get in the way.  pride is a sin.  hehe.  yeah, yeah, i know about that respect thing but it's not like there was no disrespect.  it just makes me realize that i'm growing up and i'm noticing the importance of family...immediate or not.  i think family should be there and give support to each other...even if some family members may not agree with you.  but i guess that's my opinion...and that doesn't really count cuz i'm the youngest.  hehe.  =)    anyway, when my cousins on my dad's side came, i hung out with them for a while in the garage.  my brother has 3 rooms and the third room has a sliding door that goes right into the backyard.  well, my mom was hanging out in that room w/ my other aunties and they can basically see outside and right into the garage.  some cousins were having a corona so i decided to have one too.  my mom is funny cuz I KNOW she knows that i would occassionally drink but she always tells me not to...same with my bro.  so, as i was having my corona, sitting in the garage, i see my mom looking!  hehe.  i looked at her and raised the bottle to her!  she was kinda laughing and then she blew a kiss to me and i caught it!  haha...everyone was laughing.  my bro also bought a nice bottle of tequilla.  some people did shots (including andy).  rod had some but instead of having it in shots, he had half a cup...twice.  so, he had a FULL cup of tequilla.  DANG!  i kinda forgot that he was drinking but he got up to get something, and he kinda tripped over my legs.  he's all like, dang...seriously, i could've tripped and fell!  he even said that he was trying to walk straight towards mom and then he tripped.  hehe.  it was funny.  that's when i noticed that he was kinda drunk or buzzed.    some things were said that i never thought would be discussed.  let's just say that a few years ago, something happened to andy.  andy and i never really talk about it cuz it's something that he wants to keep in the past...which i understand.  but saturday night, my brother brought it up!  andy didn't mind but it was just something we never openly talked about...esp. in front of other people.  at least i got to know how he felt about it.  i guess i always knew but it's different to talk about it in a different time in life...instead of that moment in the past.  did that make sense?  i can't really mention what happened or be too descriptive but my brother remembered a lot more about the situation than i did.  i was surprised.  i was just glad to know that andy wasn't uncomfortable talking about it.  it kinda showed how much my brother cared about me AND andy...which was nice.  rod even mentioned how brave andy was and is.  i guess even if that whole situation was brought up, it was nice to hear those words from my brother.    on another note, my dad doesn't really drink.  but that night, he decided to have a beer.  it was kinda cool cuz we were all drinking together...which is something we've never done.  so, we were having whatever conversations we were having.  he was done with his beer and he decided to have another one.  i just let it go but i told my brother.  rod didn't want him to drink anymore cuz he still had to drive home...but my dad didn't give in.  i was getting kinda nervous cuz honestly, i get scared of my dad when he's drunk.  thank god, he didn't drink too much.  i don't really see him get drunk anymore but he definetely used to scare me when i was a kid.    i don't know if i mentioned it before in any of my blog entries but the day after my brother got married in 2002, there was a party at my parent's house for their gift opening.  my dad made a promise to my brother to not get drunk on his wedding day but that he can drink the following day at the gift opening party.  so, yeah, my dad drank.  my auntie (across the street) and my mom were getting fed up at how much he was drinking.  it's not like he was causing any trouble to anyone.  he was basically just hanging out in a certain spot in the backyard w/ some of his friends and relatives.  everyone was drinking.  and then my aunt decided to go outside and take away all the drinks that my dad was drinking.  that was kinda disrespectful cuz my aunt (who doesn't even live there) took away my dad's stuff in his own house.  at first it was quiet.  my dad didn't say anything but all of a sudden, he started yelling.  he basically couldn't believe that he was treated like a kid in his own house.  he was yelling and crying for a while.  (yeah, my dad gets very emotional).  anyway, my dad and aunt (who lives across the street) didn't talk for like 6 months.  that's why i don't like it when he gets drunk.  he can cause major drama!!!  i just wish he can be more of a calm drunk.  hehe.

       thursday:  we went to chuckee cheese in lakewood cuz it was my neice's (christina) 1st birthday.  it was fun.  we got to hang out with the de los reyes cousins.  hehe.  i was playing ski ball and there was some little girl that was climbing on the alley or whatever you call it right next to me.  she kept taking my balls!  (sounds nasty huh?)  how rude.  i was asking her where her mom was and i don't know if she understood me.  hehe.  i ended up having to carry my balls in my hands so she wouldn't take it.  =)  YUCK!   friday:  i woke up late!  i had to run a few errands...post office, home depot, grocery store, and aaa.  andy came home from work earlier so we can get some stuff done.  after that, we went to cal state long beach to watch a basketball game.  my brother was supposed to go but he's having a birthday party tomorrow so he needed to clean and i guess prep the food.  instead, we invited joey and kristina.  it was fun.  we went because dennise rodman was playing for the long beach team and we wanted to see him.  andy went a few weeks ago with my brother (before rodman was officially on the team).  he had fun but he said it was probably 8 times more crowded tonight than it was a few weeks ago w/out rodman.  it was just so cool to see rodman play.  he basically got demoted from the nba to the aba!  nontheless, everyone was still cheering for him.  i guess he's still working his way up to the nba and just proving himself right now...to be serious instead of just goofin' off like he normally does.  hehe.  hulk hogan was also there!  he was dressed the same as how i'd see him on tv.  a lot of people were trying to get his attention and his autograph.  at times, people would yell out his name and when he looked, he took his leather jacket off and RIPPED his tank top off!  hehe ...it was funny.  after a while, people were trying to get his attention AGAIN!  he was like...what else am i supposed to take off...my pants??  hehe.  after the game, we hung out at joe's house for a while.  and now i'm home.

      today is christine's birthday (andy's sis)------- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!   =)  we had dinner at todai with the family.  as always the food was pretty good but i got so full from the soda.  oh well.  after that, we decided to go to the mall to walk around!  we ended up splitting up...me w/ andy; andy's mom w/ dad; & christine w/ her friend sherrie.  we also ended up going to walmart since it was around the corner.    anyway, my mom bought me diamond earring studs.  i've been wanting those for a long time.  actually my mom bought me one a year or two ago but i gave it back to her cuz i wanted a screw on backing.  so, i gave it to her a WHILE ago and i think she lost it!  i've never seen em ever since.  well, i bought these cute diamond dangling earrings to use for ross and mary's wedding.  unfortunately, i ended up not using em because mary gave all the girls pearls (bracelet, earrings, and neclace) to use on the wedding day.  i ended up asking my mom to return my earrings for me and what did she come back with?  diamond studs!  yay!  hehe.  i was supposed to wear em today but i lost the backing.  getting a "screw on" was supposed to solve my problems but it didn't.  since i can't just slide it off, i had to unscrew it and by the time it was about to come off, it fell.  it's somewhere on our carpet but i can't find it!  ooops.

      on sunday, after church, andy and i went to borders cuz i needed a magazine.  i saw my old friend (from junior high) on a magazine cover!  i've seen it before but it's just so weird to see someone you know on the newstand.  that's all.  hehe.

      last night andy went out to a basketball game with my brother while i stayed home and cleaned!  hehe...i just didn't wanna go.  i was actually supposed to be doing some "homework" but procrastination got in the way.    hmm...what else?  andy bought me some stuff from sephora at downtown disney for christmas.  he ended up losing his disney pass over there.  thank god for nice people cuz the pass came back to us in the mail!  it was a surprise to me cuz i thought andy just misplaced it somewhere at home.  all i can say is that he's lucky.  =)  it's not like we couldn't get it replaced but andy was just trying to deny that he lost it.  and what does that mean?  i won and he lost!  hehe...jk.    i forgot to mention something about the time when justin was with us.  well, he's starting to talk like his friends...or shall i say...cool people.  whenever he sees something neat or cool, he'll say, "that's tight!"  i was kinda shocked!  so, while he was with us for the weekend, i would say that at times.  he'd say, "auntie, stop saying that...you don't know how to say it right!"  whoa...make me feel old huh?  hehe.  i'd still say it every once and a while and he finally said, "stop it...you're giving me a headache!"  haha...i thought that was so funny.  he really thinks i can't say it in the right context.  ya ya...i guess i'm not cool anymore.  the weird thing is that when andy says it, it's right!  geez!  =)

      happy new year everyone!    this year, andy and i didn't have any definite plans.  actually...no one we were close to had a party so we just decided to stay home.  i kinda feel guilty cuz for a long time, my mom always wanted me home for new year's.  either that, or be with family.  my cousin usually throws a new year's eve party...so lately, that's where i've been.  there's only been 2 times when andy and i were alone on new year's eve.  i called my parents sometime in the evening just to find out what they're doing.  they asked if i was gonna go over there.  all i said was that there is a lot of drunk drivers out there!  hehe...they didn't argue!  YAY!    oh yeah, andy's friend was having a kick-back kind of party for new years.  to be honest, i didn't wanna go.  i dread the smell!  hehe.  andy's parent's called us and asked us if we wanted to go out to dinner.  they had a card to "be our guest" at a steakhouse called morton's steakhouse of chicago in costa mesa.  the card was gonna expire 12/31/03 so they just decided to give it to us.  they couldn't make it cuz they were doing last minute stuff before the new year came around.  i heard that place was really expensive but other than that, i knew nothing about that restaurant.  i called the place to ask what time they closed and to see if they were still accepting reservations.  they said that they were all booked up for the night and even if it was two of us, we still couldn't get in.  so, we gave up on that idea for about 5 minutes.  i just told andy that it was still worth a shot to try.  if not, we'll just have dinner somewhere else.  so, we just got ready really quick.  we stopped by andy's parent's place to pick up the card.  we got to the restaurant and it's true they were all booked...but they were still able to get us in!  we didn't even have to wait.  i was kinda nervous when we got to our table.  i wasn't sure exactly what we'd be able to get with that card.  it's not like there was a specific amount of money listed or anything at all.  it basically just says "be our guest."  oh yeah, another thing i was nervous about was if that card was good for only one person.  andy's parents already told us that they used that card before and it was good for everything.  i guess since it was written on the card, i still wasn't sure.  so, our waiter came by and andy asked if the card was good.  he then said just tell me what you want and i'll take care of you.  hehe...i still didn't get all the questions answered.  i was just thinking that we'll just have to pay for just one person if the card wouldn't cover both of us.  hehe.  i kinda felt ghetto too.  the one thing i didn't find too attractive was that before you order, you get a menu and also the waiter would show you all the things on the menu.  therefore, you see the raw meat.  it's not a big deal but it just didn't do anything for me.  haha.    so, for an appetizer we had scallops wrapped in bacon.  we also had salad.  for our main entre, we both had a huge porterhouse steak.  i had my meat cooked well-done.  andy was dissappointed that i did that.  hehe.  i guess i shouldn't have done that cuz they kinda burned it.  oh well.  the inside was REALLY GOOD!  our waiter asked if we wanted lobster to go with our steak, and we were kinda hesitant.  i guess cuz i didn't know what we were covered for.  the waiter just told us that we might as well!!  so, then we went for it.  when he said that, it made me feel better.  andy and i split one 3 pound lobster.  guess how much that costs?  $78.00.  geez!  and for dessert, we had a godiva chocolate cake w/ ice cream!   OH MY GOSH...it was so good!  i'd actually go there just for that!  hehe.   we were both so surprised at how good it was.  everything was actually really good but the dessert blew me away.  so, we finally got the bill.   GRAND TOTAL: $233.00.   that was the most expensive meal i've ever had.  hehe...i'm just a ghetto girl i guess.  the waiter came back and we just wanted to make sure that we were on the clear.  he said that everything was taken care of except for tip.  and then i went on to say that i'll have another porterhouse steak!  haha.  oh yeah...he took our plates.  andy and i didn't finish our steaks.  i didn't even finish my lobster.  i probably ate only half of it!  i was so full.  anyway, he took our plates to put it in a box.  i assummed that everything was in there.  when we opened up the box today, it was only the steaks.  MY LOBSTER WAS GONE!  that was probably worth $20!  geez...what a waste.  hehe.  oh well.  it was quite an experience to go there.  it was fun.

      today we had a baby shower for my bro and sisnlaw at my parent's house.  overall, it was pretty good.  i was just not feeling that well cuz of my cold.  oh well.  i was actually surprised by the amount of people that showed up.  my cousins did the games for the shower...and it was so fun!  i didn't play all of em but it was even funny to watch everyone play...the young people and old people.  hehe.    i've been so tired lately just doing last minute stuff for the party.  i didn't finish the favors till about 30 minutes before the party.  hehe.  well, it looks like they got a lot of good stuff for the baby!  CUTE STUFF!  hehe.  me, andy, and my aunt ended up getting them a car seat and my parents got them a stroller that also goes with the car seat we got!  yeah....that's what the registered for.  hehe.    a lot of people are starting to say that she's gonna have a boy!  is she getting ugly or what? =)  andy's sister first told me that if the girl starts to get ugly during her pregnancy, she'll have a boy!  my aunt said the same thing last night.  she said something like.....yeah, she's gonna have a boy cuz she's getting uglier!  hehe.  isn't that mean?  hehe.  we'll see if it's really true cuz i also think it'll be a boy.  2 more months....

      andy and i decided to watch passions on ash wednesday.  he ended up taking a half day and got off of work around 10am.  so, we watched it sometime in the afternoon.  when we got out of the theater, some guy approached us, asking us questions about the movie.  it turns out that he was from the oc register newspaper.  hehe.  i didn't put in as much input as andy did so his name ended up being in the paper.  andy bought....i mean, took a few extra newspapers!  hehe...so lame!  after that, we went back home.  i was and still am sick so i ended up falling asleep when i got home...when i was supposed to be studying.  oh well.  we also went to church after my class!  what a religious day right!  =)    on friday, i spent the night at my parent's house!  isn't that amazing?  hehe...it's cuz i haven't spent the night over there ever since i moved into the condo in anaheim hills!  i basically stayed there to help out with the party!

      on friday, i went to carson to run some errands with my mom.  she wore me out!  hehe.  we had to go to all these places to go shopping for the baby shower.  finally, we were off to the mall cuz she needed to return something.  well, we found some clothes (for me) and she bought em for me.  i got 3 pairs of pants and 1 top!  =)  i haven't gone shopping for a while!!  or have i?!  hehe.    anyway, i was hungry so i picked some food up from thai barbecue.  we just went home and ate it.  my aunt came over and we were just talking.  i ended up seeing georgia cuz i had to give her an invitation to the party.  nothing too interesting to blog about huh?!  hehe.    on the weekend, andy and i just stayed home.  either that, or i just don't remember what we did!  hehe.    yesterday (monday), i had to go to carson again cuz my mom asked me to take her to see someone regarding her work related injury.  she had to get her wrist operated on.  well, she gave me the directions and i had a feeling it was at or pretty close to where i used to work at molina.  and what do ya know?  i turned into the exact parking lot!  i was in awe!  hehe...i kept saying things like, awww...this is where i used to park...blablabla!  hehe...i know it's pathetic.  when we got into the building, i had a blank mind and totally forgot what floor i used to work on!  well, my mom's paper said to go on the second floor so off we went.  when we got out of the elevator, i saw molina signs.  that's when i realized that that's the floor i used to work on.  hehe.  i got kinda nervous cuz i didn't want anyone to spot me.  we went downstairs and realized we went into the wrong tower.  we finally got to the right place on time!  i guess it takes a while to pull a file out so the attorney said to meet in another hour.  so, me, my mom, and aunt decided to just hang out outside.  i decided to call my old coworker, malia.  she kept asking me to visit but i just wasn't sure if that was a good idea.  i finally found out that my old boss (my enemy) is no longer there!  i guess after hearing that, i decided to just go up and visit them!  hehe.  it was so nice to see everyone again.  i saw my enemie's office EMPTY!  =)  i stayed there for about an hour just talking to malia and pshyra.  i told them that i was still jobless and that i saw a few positions open up for the department...but i didn't do anything about it cuz i had my pride!  i had no clue if meda, my old boss was still there.  they made me feel good cuz it's like they totally understood me and they know why i did what i had to do.....LEAVE!  let's just say that that department kind of looks too empty!  other people got into it and fought with meda!  can you believe that?  i wasn't sure if the director understood what i was going through.  according to pshyra, she said that she probably didn't know at the time i left but it's likely that she knows now.  anyway, that visit made me feel good.  andy was surprised that i actually had the guts to visit.  well, i did but that's cuz meda isn't there anymore.  she now works for kaiser and after being there for a few weeks, she asked the director if she can come back.  so, she was gonna try to pull some strings to get meda back in.  i guess marian, the director told the rest of the team and everyone was disappointed.  marian wondered why and that's when it all came out.  so, she never came back.    after the visit, we went out to lunch at a chinese buffet.  i felt like it was a waste cuz i wasn't even hungry!  after that, i went home and studied for the test i'm gonna be having tomorrow!

      happy belated valentine's day!  andy and i decided to go out and celebrate valentine's day friday instead of saturday...which was friday, the 13th.  hehe.  we just had dinner at that buffet at pala casino.  after that, we decided to gamble a bit!  i lost!  thank god i usually don't gamble with a lot of money!  =)  i really just don't want to be like me dad!  he's a gambling addict!  sometimes my friends would ask me if i want to play cards or whatever and usually i don't!  if i do, i feel weird!    the following day, saturday, andy went to his parent's house to help his dad work on their backyard.  i basically stayed home.  i'm working on the favors and invitations for my bro's baby shower.  after andy got back, we went to carson to visit my parents and my other cousins.  my cousin and i were talking for a while about the shower while the other kids were watching lion king 1.5.  after our talk, i was able to watch the movie...at least parts of it!  it was so funny!  i wasn't that much of a big fan when the first lion king came out.  that's why i was so surprised at how funny i thought 1.5 was!  i wanna get that movie.  it's on sale right now at walmart...but they were sold out at the one i went to.  =(

      andy had the day off today!  sometimes i go on those websites to try to get tickets to a talk show.  so far, i went to wayne brady's show with vanna white and mandy moore.  well, i noticed that britney spears was going to be on the ryan seacrest show.  so, i printed out the ticket and andy happened to have the day off...so off we went!  the paper said to be there by 10:30am.  we ended up leaving the house around 8:15am.  it was traffic---y but we still made it in time!  well, the whole area was crowded.  even if i had a reservation, we still weren't able to get in.  i was kinda sad but i was just trying to figure out a way to just stay in the outdoor courtyard since that is a public place.  people go shopping there.  it's not like they're gonna shut the stores down just cuz britney spears was there!  there were so many security people there making sure you're just not standing around...unless you're in a designated place.  we were even thinking of just having coffee at starbucks for a few hours!  hehe.  basically, i just didn't wanna feel like we went there for nothing.  we were able to kind of watch the band and the dancers rehearse.  well, andy and i decided to just walk around hollywood.  kiisfm was also there.  after about 15-20 minutes of not knowing what to do with the situation, i decided to just pass by the main stage and then just leave after that.  so, we were walking on our merry way.  we started to hear the band play again...but this time i noticed that the crowd was a little more louder.  all of a sudden, we heard britney's voice.  she performed the whole toxic song and we were able to see it........well, sort of.  it was just really crowded.  she was doing a sound check.  who would've known you have to basically camp out the night before just to see britney.  i certainly didn't...and i don't know if i'll ever do that.  at least we were able to see her rehearse!  hehe.    after that, andy and i just went driving around in hollywood.  we also had lunch at todai.  it was yucky.  a lot of things were cold!  oh well.  i still had a fun day!  =)

      saturday, i went to a volunteer training thingy for the organization that i will probably volunteer for.  it was from 1pm to 5pm.  i was dreading just thinking about going but it was actually fun!  and i learned a lot!!  before i left for the training, justin called us to ask us if we can go to his basketball game.  actually, we weren't home at the time so he left a message on the machine.  afterwards, he talked to andy and i guess andy couldn't go cuz he had to do some stuff.......andy said that justin seemed disappointed.  =(  but i guess that's where we're going next saturday.    on sunday, my brother had a little get together at his house for superbowl.  did i watch the game???  NO!  haha...i'm not into it.  i didn't even watch the commericals.  the only thing i saw was the half time show with janet jackson's boob!  haha.  otherwise, i was just busy playing with the kids.  they are so much fun!  we were also able to discuss the baby shower for my bro and sis.  we had to either have it a little earlier or really really close to her due date because my mom will be in philippines for a while.  so, yeah, it'll be feb. 29.  she's not even due till may.  oh well.    well, there's nothing really to blog about....bye!

      how dumb am i?  i went to santa ana college to go to class today!  oops...it was tuesday and my class was on monday.  that means i missed it!  so dumb.  oh well.    since i was in santa ana, i decided to go to my bro's house to drop off the invitations.  that was by-far the most complicated invitations i've ever worked on.  there's just a lot of cutting and glue-ing involved.  but i guess i like it.  it's a diaper shaped invitation.  anyway, i called melani to ask if i can come over but they were on their way out to lamaze class.  she said that i can come over anyway to just hang out since i have the key to their house.  so, that's what i did.  i had to run a few errands on the way over there and even got food from the loft.  i got there right before 8pm...right on time for american idol!  hehe.  vanessa ended up calling me so she told me about her drama...until my brother came home.  i actually stayed there till midnight.  we were just talking...which is good cuz i haven't talked to them for a while.

      I havent blogged for a while now.  Hmmmlets see what I can remember.  Last week, Andy and I went to Vegas!  We went cuz I read on his cousins blog that they got a room for 10 bucks!    Since I love bargains, I checked out their website, and there it was!  We went there on a Sunday morning and left Monday afternoon.  If you ask me, the room was well worth the $10.  Yeahits not the best but its a lot cleaner and better looking than wild wild west---and probably a lot of other hotels out there.  Anyway, we had a lot of fun.  We even took a side trip to Hoover Dam.  To be honest, that place was boring.  I was so freakin sleepy during the tour.  On the other hand, Andy enjoyed it..even if he lost our new camera bag with a new $60 or $70 battery!  Oh well.  We finally had a late lunch at some Hawaiian buffet in downtown Vegas.  Weve gone there before and I think I remember liking it.  But this time was different!  It was nasty!  So we went to the casinos for a bit!  Those 99 cent margaritas made me feel better!  Hehe.  After downtown, we went back to the strip and just walked around.  The following day was the same!  We had breakfast at the Excalibur hotel!  It was so good.  We stopped by State Line on our way home.  I won but then lost it again.  At least we didnt lose too much money.  Well, thats why we didnt buy anything at the outlet.    We havent cut Coachs nails for monthsmaybe even a year.  We dont know for sure but we think Coach bites her nails.  HahaI know that sounds dumb but its not like she has the luxury of running around on cement to file her nails down.  We dont walk her every single day either.  Well, a few days ago, Coach was on top of Andys lap and its like she was trying to bite her nails.  Hehe.  I just thought that was funny.    Oh yeah, on Friday, Andy and I watched Jersey Girl.  I thought it was a good movie!  That little girl kind of reminds me of the way I used to be with my parents!  So Mean!    On Saturday, we helped Andys sister Christine and her friend Sherrie move.  They moved out of the apartment that we used to stay in.  That place looks a lot worse than when I was living there.  Either that or we just never noticed it.  People actually left their food outside.  Isnt that nasty and rude?  Im sure theyre glad to be outta there.    Tomorrow, Andy wants us to hang out at his friends house.  Im not sure if Im going cuz I actually just wanna stay home!  I have to work on another baby shower invitation.  Melanis parents are also throwing a shower for them.

      i'm still awake!  anyway, yesterday, sunday, andy and i went to disneyland....actually california adventure.  we went with a few friends.  our annual pass is going to expire tomorrow!  andy really wants to renew it but i think it's just so freakin' expensive!  we were originally supposed to renew it at disneyland but the line was too long...and we didn't wanna wait.  we MIGHT just send the form in to renew it.  we'll see.    since the line was long (and the whole park very crowded), andy and i went over to california adventure.  we met up w/ andy's friends.  we actually stayed at the park for a long time.  we usually just spend an hour or two over there but this time we stayed longer than we normally do.  it's probably because one of our friends' cousins came along and she's from japan!  we had a lot of fun!  their "who wants to be a millionaire" show was cool.  you actually have a chance to be in the "hot seat" and win prizes.  if you get a million points, you win a disney cruise!  so, we watched a few shows and went on a few rides.  we went on that one water rapids ride.  we saw how soaked a lot of people were from that ride so someone came up with the idea to pay whoever gets wet the most $1 each.  (there were a total of 7 people in our group).  well, guess who won that money?!  I DID!  haha...i was soaking!  it was fun though.

      last sunday, andy and i went to carson AGAIN to give my mom something.  well, my mom has been wanted to watch the passions of christ but i guess never found the time or never had anyone to go with or just didn't have a ride.  ya, my mom doesn't drive.  so, andy and i decided to invite my parents and my aunt to watch it.  since it was already a few weeks after it originally came out, i assummed that it wouldn't be as crowded...but i was wrong.  we were supposed to go to the 6:30pm or 7:00pm show at rolling hills but by the time we got there, it was all sold out till around 9:30pm.  so, we went to the galleria to see if we can get tickets there for the same time...but again, it was sold out!  apparently, my mom really wanted to watch it.  andy was supposed to take my dad home so that he'll pick the ladies up after the movie but andy....NICE ANDY...said that we ALL should watch it & that he will just go to my parent's house to sleep.  he couldn't stay up and watch the movie w/ us cuz he had work the following day.  so, yeah, we ended up watch it at 9:40pm.  i was so surprised that my mom wanted to watch it that bad.  well, everyone liked the movie...cried like babies!

      i'm going to carson too many times.  i went there on monday to pick my driver's license and some other stuff up and i went there on friday to take my mom to the mall.  and later on today, i will be going there AGAIN!  i just have to give my mom some paperwork before she leaves for philippines.  i think she'll be leaving on tuesday or wednesday.  oh well.  apparently, a few days ago was girl's day!  so, my girlfriends and i got together to hang out yesterday!  these girls are actually andy's guy friends' girlfriends!  hehe...did that make sense?  i knew that since the girls were gonna hang out, the guys wanted to do the same thing!  so, we met up at joey & kristina's house in long beach.  the girls went out to lunch at some restaurant in long beach (2nd street) while the guys went to the gun range.  =)  anyway, it was fun hangin' w/ the girls.  after lunch, we walked for a bit and looked into a few stores.  at one of the stores, i ended up going to the baby section and eventually everyone else came.  there were some cute things.  there was a tiny ceramic container for baby's first tooth and baby's first curl!  all of a sudden, mary said, "you can buy that for my baby!"  hehe...that was her way of telling us that she's pregnant!  so yeah, she's 3 months pregnant!  we were so happy for her!  i guess she didn't want to say anything till after she was 3 months pregnant...just incase anything were to happen!!  that's also what my brother did.  after that, we hung out at the house for a while...then we were off to dinner!  we were supposed to eat at some japanese restaurant in torrance/gardena but they only had one room big enough for the 10 of us & it was pretty much reserved.  we wanted to go into that room because you take off your shoes & sit on the floor just like in the tatami room in memoirs of a geisha.  i even saw some of the workers (girls) wear slippers that reminded me of the slippers from that book!  hehe.  so, eventually i wanna go back over there and try it out.  i went to a restaurant that was similar 2 that in canada but now that i saw this restaurant, it seems like it was more of an authentic japanese cuisine.  anyway, we ended up going to a korean bbq place in torrance.  it was alright.  after dinner, we went to yankee doodle's in long beach to play pool.  and that was the end of our night!    i was actually supposed to go to carson last night but we left after midnight...which means that my mom was sleeping.

      i just bought my first issue of playboy!  hehe.  no, i'm not turning lesbo!  i just wanted to support an old friend,  urlLink kay sivilay , since she has a hot 4 page layout in that magazine!  =)  i haven't seen that girl for a LONG time.  if it wasn't for friendster or myspace.com, i wouldn't have known about her modeling success.  what's funny is that recently i was cleaning out my closet at my parent's house and found a box filled with letters from my friends back in jr. high/high school.  i felt like reminiscing and went through a lot of those letters.  and what did i find?  i found letters from karouna!  hehe...i wont even mention what those letters were about.  it's just funny reading my old letters...even embarassing!  =)  she even remembers writing those letters to me!  haha...too funny!

      yesterday, andy and i were walking coach to a park close to our place until a lady pulled her car over and said that there was a coyote down the hill.  so, we just walked in the opposite direction back home.  i hate coyotes!  on friday, we went over to national's with my friends to watch the laker game!  i'm not into basketball but i just wanted to go to hang out w/ my friends.  we went to the one in torrance.  i know those places are usually loud but there were these 2 people who kept going at it.  one of the guys were for the lakers and the other guy was for the other team (i forgot who they were).  it was so irritating and they were even putting each other down.  one of em wanted to bet but the other didn't so he just kept making fun of him.  haha...so stupid.  thank goodness one of the guys left after halftime!  anyway, i just liked that place because we went during happy hour...which means half off appetizers and $3 martini's!  their martini's were good!  after that, we went to my aunt's house to drop off these baby shower things that i made for my cousin's coworker's shower.  i'm starting to have a business.  hehe.    saturday, i decided to get a haircut.  i'm not as happy with it cuz it's too short.  i just didn't expect that much to be chopped off.  i guess i'm just not used to it.  oh well.   while i was getting my haircut, andy went to long beach to help his friend move.  i ended up staying at that hair place longer than expected cuz the person i had an appt. with was running late.  the girl that was before me got her hair colored and after she got her hair rinsed, she left cuz she didn't know it was gonna take that long.  she didn't even get a hair cut or have her hair blow dried!  i was also in a hurry but i still wanted her to fix my hair.  =)  by the time i got out of there, it was around 5:30pm.  melani had another baby shower at her parent's house and it started at 4pm.  so, we were late.  and besides, they wanted us to pick chinese chicken salad up at the loft which made us even more late.    i think melani knows the sex of her baby.  before she got the 4d sonogram done, she had a feeling what the baby's sex was going to be.  i thought that same thing too until after the sonogram.  hehe.  so, me, my brother, mel's immediate family, andy, and my immediate family were the only ones who supposedly knew the sex of the baby.  well, someone leaked that information out to some coworkers.  hehe.  so, when they were opening the gifts from the baby shower, they got some clothes that were specific to the baby's sex.  most of the other people (who don't know) gave neutral gifts that are good for either a boy or girl.  that's why they got a lot of yellow stuff.  hehe.  so, i think mel and my brother knew that someone told their coworkers and now melani may have an idea of what it is.  also, my brother and melani were shopping at potterybarnkids and mel noticed that my brother kept looking at the ********** section.  oh well.    my parents should be coming back from philippines tomorrow!  i'm actually excited.  hehe.  they've been gone for so long!  i think this is the longest vacation they've ever taken.  how weird.    now i have to finish up my paper that's due tomorrow.  yuck!

      today my class got cancelled!  YAY!  since i had some extra time, i decided to go to fry's electronics to buy some stuff.    last weekend, andy and i were supposed to go camping in malibu.  it didn't happen cuz we found out that it was supposed to rain (which it did) and we totally forgot that we had a family party to go to.  oops.  i kinda wanna go now before it gets too hot.  also, it looks a lot prettier now during spring than it does during summer.  since we didn't go, andy got off work a little early and we went to that seafood place in san pedro again.  we also walked along the beach!  we haven't done that in a long time.  all the beaches here are just so freakin' far to just go walking.  anyway, on saturday, we went to that one family party.  it was my aunt and uncle's birthday and my cousin also got a promotion.  she works at csulb doing stuff with their graduate programs...(or something like that) so andy was trying to see if he can get a degree!  haha...yeah right.  after that party, we went to target to buy stuff we needed.  then we were off to andy's friend's house to watch the laker game!  i'm not really into the lakers or watching basketball itself (unless i watch it in person) but i just go along with the ride!    yesterday, (tuesday), andy and i went to LA cuz we were supposed to watch the sharon osbourne show!  hehe.  he kinda got home later than expected...but we still decided to give it a try.  well, we probably would've made it on time but we couldn't find the street it was on!  haha.  we weren't too disappointed since we didn't even know who was gonna be on the show.  instead, we just drove around for a bit and we went towards beverly center.  i haven't been there in so long.  andy was really hungry so we had dinner at grand lux cafe!  melani told me about that place so we gave it a try.  i thought it was gonna be like a regular cafe but it was a really nice restaurant w/ really good food.  the owner of that restaurant also owns cheesecake factory.  i would go there again!  by the time we finished dinner, the mall was closed so we didn't get to walk around.  instead, we just went back home.

      my easter weekend was kinda hectic!    friday: i woke up early and bought a few things at michaels.  they had a sale where you get 50% off of anything regular price.  i bought some cardstock, scrapbook paper....a few crafty stuff.  my brother and melani came over.  we just hung out for a bit-- andy also had to help my bro with his computer.  we just talked for a while.  we also had dinner.  we had dinner at a place called california fish and grill.  we've passed by that place more than a few times and have always wanted to try it.  i thought it was more of a restaurant but it's more laid back.  i liked it.  their calimari is good!  they probably left our place around midnight so after that, andy wanted me to go with him to ronald's house.  he had to just check up on their house and feed the dog since they were out of town that weekend.    saturday:  urlLink we had a little picnic with andy's friends.   we all met up at joey's house and headed over to san pedro (ports o call).  you basically buy whatever seafood you want (buy by the lb.) you then take your raw food to another station and they cook it up.  they add vegetables and potatoes.  it's so yummy!  the place we got that food at is ghetto though!  that's why we had a picnic.  i didn't wanna eat in that area.  it kinda looks like a swapmeet.  hehe.  we went over to some park.  i forgot what it's called but they usually have those filipino fairs over there.  we had a table right by the ocean.  it was so NICE and the food was so GOOD!  andy and i basically brought the rice, drinks, and whatever else we needed.  we knew what we needed cuz we did the same thing with my brother and melani a while back.  after our picnic, we headed over to joey's and hung out for a bit.  we decided to call justin and kayla to see if they wanted to spend the night with us.  they did so we picked them up.  my brother asked if we can visit since they wanted to see the kids.  we didn't stay that long cuz andy forgot his keys at joey's place.  we ended up meeting up at an ice cream place.  it's kind of like coldstone.  it was so good.  i couldn't believe that me and kayla got the same size ice cream (in a waffle cone) and she finished it.  i only ate about half of it.  i had to get a cup so i can put it in the freezer to eat it again later.  haha.  so, we finally got home and of course we slept late.  they were busy either playing with coach or painting.  it was fun but we were tired.    sunday: all 4 of us went to the 8am mass.  i was surprised at how well they are in waking up in the morning.  i thought they'd have a hard time!  after mass, we had breakfast at denny's.  then we just played games at the house.  we were just waiting for time to pass by before we had to go to our next outting.  we were going to their uncle's house (maria's side) who happens to live in yorba linda.  their house is so nice and huge!  i wanna house sit for them one day.  hehe.  they also have a nice and BIG backyard w/ a NICE view.  the kids had a great time with their easter egg hung in their yard.  hehe.  so, we finally left that party and the kids to go to andy's aunt's house in lakewood.  we kinda stayed their longer than expected (since we watched pirates of the carribbean).  after that, we went to my brother's house to drop some stuff off.  after all that...and all that food, i was so freakin' tired!  we finally made it home to watch nick and jessica's variety show...which wasn't all that.  i just liked the performance w/ babyface.  hehe.

      i forgot to post this but last weekend, andy and i went to the pet expo.  i actually didn't wanna go but andy did.  i was kind of bored but it was alright!  hehe!  on our way there, i got a text message from my mom!  i was like...who the heck is this?  i wasn't sure...but it really was my mom.  i just thought that was cute.  she even asked about coach!

      earlier this afternoon, i talked to my brother.  he asked if i wanted to go out with him and melani to get their 4D ultrasound done!  talk about last minute...their appointment was at 5pm and he told me about an hour and a half before-hand.  thanks bro!  hehe...well, i still wanted to go.  one of my friends got one done and it was quite amazing!  so, i guess i wanted to go in for that experience.  well, mel's mom got off work early so she was also able to go.  since her house was on my way, i picked her up.  there was so much traffic!  ya, we were late but luckily the people at  urlLink first look sonogram  were willing to move one of their appointments up.  so, we didn't miss anything.  we all went into a room with a plasma tv, speakers and a comfortable couch!  melani still didn't wanna know the sex of the baby but said it was okay for me, her mom, and my bro to find out...she would just cover her eyes!  so, basically the person doing the ultrasound focused a lot more on the baby's face!  to me, he/she is already cute!  i think most of the time, the baby was sleeping but at one point, he/she stuck his/her tongue out!  i just couldn't believe how clear the baby looked!  you can even see the baby's movement.  so, it was time for melani to close her eyes (put her jacket over her eyes) so that lady can look at the other parts!  she basically moved the pointer thingy to show us things and then she typed the sex of the baby on the screen!  i kinda got too excited that i made a noise!  it didn't really matter what the sex was...i guess i just felt amazed that this thing inside of melani is just so real that i can't wait to meet him/her!  anyway, i can't say what the sex of the baby is to anyone...except my parents but they wont be back from philippines till the end of the month!    after the sonogram thing, we went to my cousin's house to pick more bottles up (for the other baby shower)!.  on our way there, mel's mom was in the car with me and we were just talking about how hard it might be to not say anything about the baby's sex.  it's not like we're gonna blab our mouths to anyone...(cuz no one is supposed to know except for immediate family).  the reason for that is if we were to tell anyone, melani will be bound to hear it from someone else!  that's why they just want the circle to be small so it wont get out!  it's just that people like to buy things esp. when they know the sex of the baby!  haha...oh well.  no point...i guess.

      i actually have ONE friend that i've known since jr. high that talks the same and does the same things that we used to do in jr. high.  a few months ago, i found all my old letters and read some letters that she wrote to me and realized that even today, she still writes the same as she did in jr. high.  i'm not talking about the pitch in her voice or the way she writes.  i guess i'm just talking about her attitude.  it's like the rest of the people i know...whether it's friends, family, aquaintances, she's the only one that didn't grow up.  isn't that sad?  well, i guess i should give her a little credit.  but still, half the time, i can't believe certain things she does.

      on wednesday, i had a test and forgot about it until tuesday night!  so, i was studying and readng sooo last minute!  hehe...i think i did pretty well!    yesterday, the weather was so weird!  i remember it was kinda cloudy but didn't even think it was going to rain.  i ran a few errands and then i met andy at the house cuz i wanted him to go with me to henry's market.  we just wanted to try that place out.  so, we went grocery shopping...and when we went out, it was raining so freakin' hard!  i was wearing slippers that get VERY slippery when wet so i was holding on to andy.  hehe.  i need to buy new slippers that don't get slippery!  my other slippers that i normally wear (another slippery pair) broke when we went to vegas!    oh yeah, i just found out that we may be going to vegas again in two weeks.  my friend has been wanting to go (i guess since she hardly has time to go out since she had her baby).  so, andy and i might tag-along!  our other friend also has a comp'd room!  YAY!  well, it depends on andy cuz he's still thinking about it.  i guess i can still go w/ out him!  i would probably just babysit the baby anyway!  haha.  all i know is that i gotta save my money whether or not we go to vegas.

      Looks like I'm going to be a biter because I'm thinking of joining  urlLink imagestation Hehe. I was reading Andy's cousin's blog and I guess that's where she stores her pictures.  I usually keep my pictures on  urlLink ofoto  but I might change it because it seems like with  urlLink imagestation , you can store the pictures at the original resolution.

      Looks like I'll be a busy bee this weekend. Tomorrow I'll probably be going to Carson to visit my parents.  She's been wanting us to go over there to help her look around for a cell phone. After that, we're headed over to Dolphin Park for Gavin's (Grace's kid's) 1st birthday party. He turned one on April 3 and he's barely having his party now! Oh well. He's growing up so fast! The following day, we're headed over to Andy's cousin's graduation party! And on top of that......I'm still waiting for Melani to have her baby! Hehe. Okay, so I have two parties to go to (one on saturday and one on sunday). It doesn't sound like much but I guess I'm thinking that I'll be super busy because I'm just HOPING that the baby will be coming this weekend.  Ever since that false alarm, Melani hasn't been going to work and has been walking a lot.  That's why she thought she'd give birth by now.  Apparantly not!  Oh yeah, I want to go out to Coldstone right now! Yummy! =)

      So far, we've had one false alarm! Hehe...Melani thought her water broke.  They ended up going to the hospital and sure enough, it was a false alarm! Oh well.  I've been kind of eager and excited because their due date is this Thursday!   It's been almost a month since my car broke down. It's very depressing not having a car...not being able to go out whenever you want.  At times, I feel like a kid.  Heck, I feel like my mom and aunt too!  They both have to rely on someone to drive them around! Well, we haven't gotten the car done for 2 reasons...    1) Ever since we got our transmission flushed at EZ LUBE, the car (transmission) has been acting up & the transmission light would come on.  We've gone back there a few times to tell them what's been going on and they told us (several times) to restart the car whenever the transmission light goes on.  It resets the sensor in the transmission. He also said that you should restart the engine about 25 times.  So, we did what they said.  At first the car was fine but I guess the transmission just gave out at the end. We're just waiting to see if they MAY be responsible for the damage and who knows...maybe they'll pay for it...at least some of it!    2) MONEY! I have enough money for what we "think" the problem is but again, we're just waiting to see what EZ LUBE has to say about it.    So, for the past few weeks, I haven't been going anywhere since I don't have a car.  Andy has just been taking me to school...and the semester just finished last week! =)  I'm looking into going back to school for real since no one wants to hire me! =( I'm just worried about money and I guess worried about where to live.  I hope that I'll still be qualified for some kind of financial aid.    On Friday, my neice, Kalea did a performance at her school.  She's so cute.  She just turned 6 that same day.  She did a performance with her class singing and dancing to a few songs (which included the "chicken dance") and she also did the hula with a different group!  That performance was soooo good!  After that, we went over to their house for dinner.  They just moved into that house so they were happy to have their first guests! =)    Anyway, after my brother and Melani left the hospital the day they had their false alarm, my brother called me.  I guess he wanted to make sure I was going to be there at the hospital when the baby's born.  I already had that on my mind.  Heck, I check the answering machine, my voice mail, caller id (almost) constantly!  I asked Andy what would happen if Melani was already having the baby...while he was at work.  Hehe...he already told his work about it and they're letting him go whenever that time comes...except for Thursday (which is the due date).  Haha. Well, at this stage, my brother and Melani are always together.  They even carpool to work together.  Since they're only using one car, my brother is letting me use his car till the baby comes.  It's also so I can run some errands for him while he's in the hospital.  Isn't that nice?  So, yeah, Andy and I went over to their house tonight so I can pick the car up.  Andy ended up leaving Long Beach earlier than I did.  I just hung out with my brother for a bit.  We even put the carseat in the car.  Ummm...I just want someone else to check if we did it right! =)

      For the past two days, Andy has been going to the E3 gaming convention at the LA convention center.  When he comes home, he's like a little kid that just got back from trick-or-treating on halloween...sorting out his candy!  =)  He got a lot of goodies and is just so excited!  How cute is that?!  HeHe!

      It was my mom's birthday today.  The night before, my brother called me to help him figure out where we should have dinner.  Somehow we were on the phone for over an hour! I'm not used to talking to my brother that long!  The weird thing is that, when we got off the phone, we still couldn't decide on a specific place!  We had a few places in mind but nothing definite.  We met with my family at my brother's house in long beach and we were kind of late because Andy was in heavy traffic on his way back from the E3 convention.  So, when we got there, I found out that we are eating at a totally different place!  We were going to a Filipino restaurant!  For some reason, I hate eating at Filipino restaurants!  I think it's because I know my mom can cook most of the food...and I guess, I just don't like a majority of Filipino foods...at least at the restaurant!  Oh well.  It was still a fun dinner but of course, I still didn't like the food (except for the barbecue stick)! I know a lot of people probably think I'm weird for not liking Filipino food...esp. since I'm Filipino!  I think the only Filipino foods I like are the certain ones my parents cook!  I think it also has to deal with comfort food.  For example, Andy can make chicken adobe but it's not as good as when my mom makes it!  Weird, I know.    Anyway, Melani already packed her suitcase for the hospital.  She couldn't decide which outfit the baby should wear on his/her way home. Since she doesn't know the sex of her baby, I told her that I will go ahead and buy the baby his/her first outfit (pink for a girl/blue for a boy)!  She didn't want the baby's first outfit just a neutral color (since that's all they have), so I'm kind of excited to buy the baby's first outfit!  Did any of that make sense? =)  She has about 14 days until her due date!

       A video posted Tuesday on an Islamic militant Web site showed the beheading of an American civilian, who identified himself as Nick Berg, in Iraq, and said the execution was carried out by an al-Qaida affiliated group to avenge the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers. (AP Photo/Jacqueline Larma).   i just saw the entire video of the decapitation of nick berg.  it was so disturbing, disgusting, and just plain sad! i haven't really paid much attention to the news lately but i saw a few video stills on tv earlier tonight and andy told me that they beheaded that guy! at first, i couldn't believe it. that is just soooo cruel!  andy was trying to look for the video on the net but couldn't find it.  so, he was on his way to go to sleep.  i decided to look for the video and i found it.  andy wanted to check it out too (and i guess i'm glad he was with me) so we watched it.  oh gosh, i just felt sick to my stomach but i was still watching it!  andy wanted to just close it out but i wouldn't let him.  i don't know why...it's really not a good thing to see!  and to think....i've been feeling bad for whoever leaves american idol!  obviously, there are a lot more bigger and important things to think about in this world!

      i just did a blog but somehow it got erased.  oh well.  anywayz, andy and i ended up getting tickets to the jay leno show w/ the friends cast on the friends set.  a few weeks ago, i was on some website and found out that they were giving a certain amount of tickets away on a certain day at a certain time.  so, i made sure to be at that website at the right time and that's how i got it.  i was only able to get two tix...because they sold out in less than 5 minutes...at least that's what they said!  so, andy took a half day so we can go to the show.  we got there around 11:30am.  when we got there, we had to show them our print out so they can give us the real tickets (it has a # on it so it'll hold our place in line)...and i was surprised cuz no one was there yet.  so, we got our tickets and we went out to lunch.  we went to a place called dalt's grill.  it was so good.  we went there at the right time cuz by the time we left, that place was packed!  also, when we got back to the place where we got our tickets, there was a huge line.  thank goodness our tickets had numbers on it to hold our place in line!  i thought that was a good idea so you don't have to always stay in one spot the whole time.  anyway, it was so hot that day!!  we had to wait a while to get to the studio cuz the shuttles were taking us over there.  they basically take you into the studio in sections.  on our way there & while we were waiting, we saw nancy o'dell from extra or access.  (don't remember).  the camera was looking towards us but i don't know if we ended up being on camera though cuz i didn't see the show.  did anyone see us?  hehe.  so, we finally got into the studio!  we were finally out of the hot sun!  hehe.  andy and i got pretty good seats.  we were right in the middle!  there was a warm up guy giving out friends stuff/tonight show stuff for doing silly things.  he wanted people to dance from the back of the audience section to the front.  they ended up having a contest and there was this one girl who seemed like she enjoys dancing with poles!  haha.  it was kinda nasty!  also, b4 we even got into the studio, there was this girl w/ huge boobs but for some reason, they were so freakin' low!  well, she wanted one of those baby doll shirts and the guy who was giving em out wanted to make sure it fits on whoever he was giving em to.  well, that girl wanted it and went to the front (where he was)...she took off her sweater and was just wearing her bra!  that was the same girl with the big and low boobs!  that was also nasty!  i don't mean to be mean but i can't help it.  hehe.  anyway, b4 the show, jay leno came out for a bit to talk to us.  after that, we were able to watch the last episode of friends.  i was so sad just cuz they were ending!  ya, i guess at times some of the shows from this season and maybe a few others would drag but i was still sad!  haha...corny i know.  i thought the season finale was pretty good.  it was good that everyone was just going on with their lives!  there's no need to have a cliff hanger because they're never coming back!  =(  i wonder if joey's show is gonna be any good.  so, the jay leno show was starting and andy and i were on tv for a fraction of a second!  did anyone see?  haha.  after the show, they gave everyone the friends book that's coming out in a few days!  it was a long but fun day!    friday, andy took the day off.  we hung out at the pool for a bit and we went to south coast plaza cuz he had a gift certificate.  can you believe we stayed at the mall for 6 hours?  andy thinks we were there for 8 hours but i really think it was 6 hours.  we hardly ever go to the mall and i guess that's why we took a long time.  we were so tired.  we were supposed to just stop by the mall to look around really quick and then go to long beach cuz my cousin just got a house over there.  well, we didn't get to do that!  after the mall, we just had dinner at tokyo lobby!  oh well.

      geez...i haven't blogged for a while.  i guess i've been busy...doing who knows what?  last wednesday, after my class, i was on my way to my parent's house to visit...since they just got back from philippines.  on my way there, i noticed that something was wrong with my car.  so, i decided to pull over and not go to carson anymore.  i called andy and (poor him), he left the sports bar (he was watching the laker game) to rescue me!  hehe.  we ended up just calling AAA to get it towed.  so, i didn't get to visit my parents that night.  i was kinda sad...can u believe that?  so, on thursday morning (around 5am), andy took me to carson b4 he went to work.  i basically slept some more when i got there...then hung out w/ my parents.  it was cool.  andy picked me up with just enough time to go to the asian store, trader joes, kfc, and home for friends!  haha...i ended up crying.    last friday, andy's friends came over to celebrate his 28th birthday.  it was fun.  it was cool.  hehe...i don't really know what to say about it cuz it's been a while.  it was a fun get-together w/ some food and cake! =)    saturday was andy's actual birthday.  his friends didn't leave till around 3am the night before, so we just slept in and just relaxed most of the time.  for dinner, we met up with his family at black angus.  after dinner, we went to ikea w/ his family.  it was cool.  i finally got to ride in their new lexus...hehe.  sunday was justin's 1st communion @ st. philomena.  i am still SO NOT used to that church...at least the new church.  it feels too much like a hall and not a church.  i guess it's just not traditional...which is what i miss.  the priest talks forever...and when he was announcing the kids' names, a majority of the people at that mass stood up and left.  the priest hasn't even ended the mass and blessed everyone.  uhh...oh well...that mass took almost 2 hours!  we were all starving!  and when we got out of the church, it kind of felt like a swap meet.  we bought churros!  hehe.  i know when i was little, the nuns used to sell churros in their garage.  i think these are just regular people.    monday, tuesday, and wednesday came...and i still have no car.  i know it's gonna be really expensive and i don't have that much money.  my mom owes me some money, so maybe that'll help me.  hehe.  i haven't been going anywhere since i have no car.  andy just takes me to school.

      I just had a looong weekend! First of all, I've been sick for the past few days. On Saturday, Andy was so excited to buy his halo edition xbox! We picked it up that morning at a wherehouse for  urlLink mwave.com . Andy also picked up an xbox for my cousin so we also went to Carson. First we stopped by my parent's house but no one was home. We just decided to watch 50 first dates and hang out over there. We were watching the deleted scenes on the dvd and I really really really think my old best friend's dad was in that particular scene (as an extra). I know he was in how stella got her groove back, a home depot commercial, and a popeye's commercial. Well, I'll find out soon enough.   Anyway, my throat was killin' me and I wanted a smoothie to soothe my throat, so Andy went to get boba at Tapioca Express while I stayed at the house. Apparently, Andy ran into my parents because the clinic they were at was near Tapioca Express. How weird! My parents were there for a long time! I thought they were just going through a regular check-up. On Friday, my dad started to have chest pains and was sweating really bad. My mom wanted to call 911 but my dad didn't want her too. He just kept saying he was fine. That's why they just decided to go to the clinic. They did an EKG on him and the doctor said it was abnormal and to go to the emergency room. So, they came home and they asked if I can take them to the hospital. I ended up taking them to the hospital while Andy stayed behind for a while because he had to visit my cousin, Glenn.   My dad seemed fine.....he was laughing and talking! He seemed normal. When we got to the ER, they took him in right away! They also did an EKG over there and they said that it was 99% abnormal and something needs to be done soon. Apparantly, the doctor said he had a mild heart attack. The next step was to do an  urlLink angiogram . Check out the angiogram movie thingy! That's exactly what the doctor told us. There are 3 different ways to fix my dad's heart problem...depending on what the angiogram test tell us. The best and easiest is medication therapy, the middle is the balloon angioplasty/stenting, or the worst case scenario...which is open heart surgery (bypass surgery). Well, he had a blockage on a huge artery! If it were clogged just a little more, he would have a major heart attack! So, yeah, my dad had to have the bypass surgery!   This is how it happened! I was in the ER room with my parents when the doctor was telling us all about the angiogram and the 3 different treatments after the test was conducted. I just put it in my head that there were 3 different treatments and I wont think about it until the doctor tells us the results. Keep in mind...I was sick. I was wearing a tank top and a skirt and I was cold! Andy went to Target to buy me some exercise pants & my mom gave me her sweater! The doctor finally came to get my mom and my brother but I didn't go because I happened to be in the bathroom changing!! After a few minutes, they came back out telling us the news...that he has to have bypass surgery. To be honest, I was kind of shocked! I don't know what the risks are but I could tell that my brother was scared! From that moment, I was feeling worse! I was shivering A LOT! They let us see my dad before he was off to surgery. I really don't know what was happening to me. I knew I was sick to begin with but for some reason, it all just got worse! I had to go to the side to catch my breath, to try to stop shaking, and I was actually trying to hold my tears back. It was scary. So, my dad was off to surgery while we stayed in the waiting room. The surgery wouldn't be done for at least 5 hours and I was debating what to do. I was so cold and I was shivering so much. My aunt wrapped me in a blanket! I was not feeling well. So, Andy and I decided to go back home to get just a few hours of sleep! I took my temp. and it was 103! I was drinking lots of fluids and TRYING to get some sleep! Coach was sleeping with me and I think she was dreaming! She was whimpering a lot & for a long period of time! That's how I woke up! I was kind of scared because I thought that was a sign...that my dad's surgery is not going too well! Well, my brother called me around 2:45am telling me that my dad's surgery went well! I felt so much better. I woke Andy up asking him if we can go back.   So, we were off to the hospital again. We were able to see my dad and he just looked so uncomfortable. He had stuff going through his body and a tube down his throat. My mom felt so bad for him that she started to cry. I think my dad could sense how nervous my mom was...so my dad kept moving when the nurses didn't want him too! My mom ended up going back to the waiting room and we were just trying to calm my dad down. We all ended up falling asleep in the waiting room. Around 7:30am, my family left while Andy and I stayed behind to see my dad while he was awake. We didn't get to see him until around 9:30am and I was so surprised at how alert he was. He said that he already feels better and stronger! That made me feel good. So, we stayed with him for a while and then we finally went home to Anaheim Hills.

      I had a goooood and loooong nap earlier tonight! Andy called in sick today since he's still sick.  I went to class this morning and after that, Andy wanted both of us to work on my aunt and uncle's anniversary video.  So, we were basically in front of the computer for a looong time!! We promised ourselves to really work at it and if we do a good job, we would reward ourselves with going out to dinner at tokyo lobby! I love that place! =) So, after we met our goal, we were off to dinner. It was so good...but on our way home, I was so tired! Both of us were! We ended up falling asleep.  The difference is that I'm awake now while he's still sleeping! I had about 5 hours sleep! That's a lot! My throat is starting to hurt so I'll probably end up getting sick too! On Thursday, we were thinking of going to my cousin's club in Long Beach's Cohiba because Jon B. will be performing! If anyone is interested in going, the info. is below! So, if we're both sick, I don't know if we'll be able to make it! =( I'm not much of a clubbing type of girl but going once or twice a year isn't bad, right? Hehe!  Sequence Events presents...

      Happy belated Father's day!   Last night, a friend emailed me through friendster asking me if I had a baby! Haha...nope! That's just my neice! Maya definetely has my brother's color! She's kind of dark! Hehe.   On Sunday, Father's day, I went to my brother's house. Andy dropped me off and couldn't stay because he had a cold.  He didn't want to get anyone sick especially Maya. So, I was able to hang out with family...mostly cousins!  My cousins and I ended up window shopping at Long Beach Towne Center. It was fun. I was trying to look for something cute for baby Maya but couldn't find anything. Oh well.   While we were at the house, my cousin called my brother on his cell phone but I decided to pick up the phone.  So, we started to chat. He also hasn't been able to find a job for a long time...longer than me!  In a few days, he'll be going to Alaska for a month with a few of his friends and he's actually going to try to look for a job there! If he doesn't find anything, he'll be going back home to Chicago in time for "east coast Maya's" first birthday and in September, he's going to drive here and just stay here! He's so brave.  My cousins, and Andy are trying to look out for positions for him. Later, my dad asked me if I was still looking for a job.  I said yeah, but I might move to Chicago to look for a job over there.  He just laughed and said, you move to Chicago while Steve moves here?! =) I actually would. I'm the type of person that would "probably" move as long as I find a good job...even if it was in Chicago. But in my case, I feel STUCK! It's not like I can go out of the state for months at a time to look for a job. I don't have that kind of money...my parent's don't either! Oh well. I'm still trying to figure myself out! But for now, I'm still a loser who wants to go back to school but wants all the financial aid in the world!

      Last weekend was Justin's 8th birthday. Andy has been wanting to get him a left handed golf club set for a while now...it's just that, it's too darn expensive! Well, my brother and Melani thought it was also a good idea.......so we split the cost! =) Now, Justin has his own set and Andy can play with him. I know Andy enjoys the sport but I don't know if he's actually good at it! Hehe. Needless to say, he's going to have to give Justin (and my brother) some lessons! =) So, Justin's party was on Saturday and it was the first time Maya spent some time at someone else's house.  They weren't even planning on staying at the party for a long time because they thought it was gonna be really crowded.  Apparently, it wasn't crowded at all.  They practically stayed the whole night...but most of their time was spent upstairs.   Right before we left for Justin's party, Andy and I heard the news about Reagan's death. I was kind of shocked.  So sad. I'm not much of a politics girl (had to take that class twice...hehe) but Reagan was my first president. I know Carter was the president when I was born, but Reagan was the first president I ever knew.   Sunday, Andy went to Corona to help his friend with some landscaping...in his backyard.  The following day, Monday, I woke up around 9am and Andy was still home. He usually leaves for work by 5:30am. He ended up calling in sick because his hands were hurting from working in the backyard!  So, we were just watching the news regarding Reagan's death...(bringing his body from the mortuary to his presidential library). I mentioned that we should go to his library or visit his star in Hollywood...but he just laughed! hehe. I also mentioned that I wanted to go to some craft store in LA. He said that he'd rather go to Simi Valley to see Reagan! So, we were off! First, we had lunch around 3:30pm at Black Angus in Cerritos. After that, we were off to Simi Valley. The traffic wasn't too bad until we got really close to the exit! It felt like forever! So, we parked at Moorpark College and saw A LOT of people! I had to use the restroom really bad and when we pulled into the parking lot, I saw A LOT of portopotties! I was scared because I've never used one of those things and I didn't intend to. I knew there were other restrooms because we were in a school! So, I went and the next obstacle was to find the end of the line! It took us a while...it was so freakin' long! It was at the back of the school and the line snakes around several times! When we got in line, we noticed it was moving pretty fast. But then there was a lady that was passing by that just came from the library and she was estimating our wait to be about 7 hours! We didn't really believe it because the line was moving fast! But boy...was she right! The line was still moving in a steady pace and that's why, at first, it didn't seem like we were waiting for a long time! That changed when we got closer to the front of the school. That felt SOOOO long and by that time, it was around midnight, and it was getting so cold. When Andy and I planned on going out there, we were estimating our wait to be around 3 hours! haha. So WRONG! We were so anxious when we were going through security and getting on the bus! We probably didn't get to the library till around 2:45am. Once we got to the library, everyting was moving pretty fast!   It was an experience I'll never forget! On our way to the library (on the bus), we passed by a HUGE memorial for Reagan that just gave me chills. It was beautiful! I couldn't believe that we were able to get so close to him! We were a lot closer than the people at Washington DC. I don't know if I'll say it was worth the wait...but I don't regret it! It's a cool thing to experience...and you get to meet people! We were so tired! Andy wanted me to drive home but I asked him if he can just drive just out of the traffic zone because I didn't want to be directed by those people on the street! I'm always afraid I'm not gonna see them and run them over! hehe. Well, that almost happened when Andy was driving. The guy was telling him to stop and Andy had to stop really hard! We didn't even say anything to each other. We were just zombies. We talked about it later. So, after the traffic zone, he pulled over so I can drive. I was eating candy and singing! =) We finally got home around 5:30am! We couldn't bring any cameras in the library so I was planning on taking some pictures at the school. They had a few memorials that I wanted to take pictures of. But by the time we got back, I forgot! Let me say it again...we were so tired! hehe. Andy ended up calling in sick again!

      I'm back from my busy weekend! =)   Saturday:  On Saturday morning, my brother called telling us that they're in the hospital & asked if we can get there soon because Mel was already dilated at 9 sonometers (usually 10 sonometers is when birth occurs). So, I had to get ready really fast.  Andy was walking Coach so that kind of held us back.  Luckily, I had everything that I needed to take (baby's clothes, gifts, camera, etc.) ready the night before so all we had to do was take a shower, get ready, and leave!  On our way to the hospital, I called Grace because her son was having a party and I was supposed to be there early to help out.  I just told her that I probably wont make it but that I'll try! When we got to the hospital, my parents, Justin, Kayla, & their parents, and Mel's mom and brother were already there! My cousin ended up staying in the delivery room to help out since she's a nurse that delivers babies!  From what I hear, Mel was so thankful to have her there because she just helped make things easier.  Otherwise, she probably would've killed my brother.  Hehe.  So, they had a baby girl.  Mel said she honestly thought she was having a boy! They named her Maya. She was born at 10:44am weighing 6 lbs 12 oz. and is 20 inches.  Mel asked if I wanted to hold her, so I did.  I was kind of scared at first but I did hold her.  I held her a few times and I was playing with my mom because I wouldn't give Maya to her.  Hehe.    Anyway, we decided to leave the hospital to give the new parents some rest. We had to run some errands for my brother and after that, we decided to go to Gavin's birthday party! It was cool to hang out with my friends.  Poor Gavin was sick so he didn't look happy.  There was a clown that looked so creapy and had a bad accent.  She was talking to the kids and at times, it seemed like they weren't paying attention! The clown even asked, "Hey, do you hear me?" Haha. It was funny.  She did a bad job with painting faces and making those balloon animals.  I don't know how they ended up with that clown!  Oh well. =) We pretty much stayed there until they were putting the tables away.  Grace's dad gave me so much cake...supposedly for me and my dad!  (my dad and Grace's dad are friends too). The party had a sports theme....and it was pretty much LAKER'd out! So, Grace gave me a few purple and yellow balloons to bring to the hospital! =)    After the party, we went to the store to buy some flowers and one of those "it's a girl" mylar balloons.  We went back to the hospital to drop it off but they didn't let us take in the purple/yellow balloons because they were latex! Oh well.    Sunday:  We stopped by the hospital (again) for about 30 minutes. We dropped off those miniature hershey chocolates because I made a "birth announcement" label for the candies! Apparently, it was a big hit because the grandparents are asking me to make more. After our short visit, we headed over to BJ's in Cerritos for Andy's cousins' graduation party! That place was pretty cool! It was huge! So, we stayed there for a while.  After that, I think we went to the hospital again.  We try to stay there in 30 minute increments because if you're there for    Monday: Maya's first day at home  We went over to Rod and Mel's house in Long Beach because some people were coming over and my dad was going to have a barbecue. We hung out there for a while.  I was feeling so bad for Melani and Maya. The baby was crying a lot and the grandmas were just trying to tell Melani what to do....things that she's not supposed to do. So, when cousin Maria (the nurse who delivers babies) came over, my brother was telling her to reinforce some of the things she should and shouldn't do. But did that work? NO! It's like the grandmas don't like to hear anything! Oh well. Poor Melani. If I were in Melani's position, I would probably be crying. Anyway, I helped clean everything up so we can all leave and let the new family get their rest. And that was that!

      hello ya'll! thank goodness the weekend is here! yesterday was my coworker's last day at work.  he's leaving because he's going to be going to school and playing college basketball in south dakota! he might actually get into the nba. haha...we'll see.  since it was his last day yesterday, we decided to go out. no one else was available so it was just us two. we just hung out at the beach for a while and headed over to the block and had a few drinks. i had fun. he's a really nice guy. he actually made me more comfortable at work...regarding the work i'm doing.  i guess he helped me realize how to do what i'm doing to its full potential.  at first i was scared...he helped me out a bit. i can't believe he's leaving.  oh well.  next friday, the whole staff will be having dinner at TGIFriday's.  that should be fun! i'm going to my first outting with coworkers! =)  tonight, andy and i might be going to my cousin's club in OC.  he's having an open bar from 9-10pm so we'll probably check that out! haha...we're so ghetto.  earlier this morning, andy went paintballing with his coworkers. he got some pretty bad bruises! that's it for now.

      My life is finally getting back to normal!&nbsp; Isn't that just greaaat?! Hehe.&nbsp; Well, last Saturday (after my uncle's funeral), Andy and I decided to renew our annual pass to Disneyland!&nbsp; The reason why we got it that day was because my neice, Kayla had a performance.&nbsp; Well, we ended up missing the performance but we still got to hang out with my cousins, neices, and my nephew!&nbsp; The following day (sunday), Kayla had another performance.&nbsp; Andy and I were supposed to go again but we ended up not going because I was so exhausted with everything!&nbsp;   Kayla's parents stayed at a Disneyland hotel for that weekend since Kayla had to perform for two days.&nbsp; They ended up giving us their key to their house just in case we wanted to spend the night over there.&nbsp; Well, when we got there that Saturday, Justin asked if he can go home with us so he can play with his xbox!&nbsp; I couldn't believe my ears!&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; An 8 year old child wants to leave DISNEYLAND so he can play with his xbox?&nbsp; That just sounds weird!&nbsp; =)&nbsp; He's so ADDICTED!&nbsp;   So, all I did during the week was work.  So far, I'm liking my new job but I sure would like to get paid more!  Oh well...at least it's something.  My new job is just so different compared to when I was at Molina Healthcare!  At Molina, it was an office job so, sometimes my day would go by so slow!  I was busy (most of the time) but a lot of times, I kind of worked too fast that at the end of the day, I'd try hard to find something else to do.  With my new job, I'm just constantly busy.  My day goes by so fast!    This past Friday, we met up with Andy's friends to eat at Greenfields.  I hate that place because I'm not much of a meat eater!  I just went since it was our friend's birthday!  I haven't seen them for so long since I've been out of the picture...spending time with my dad.  My neice (16 years old) came from New York that same day.  She's attending some kind of Youth for Christ conference in Riverside.  She's spending most of her time with family but she's also leaving for about 3 days for the conference.  It's really nice to see her again.  She has grown up so much!  Friday, I went to my brother's house just so I can spend time with her.  On Saturday, Andy and I went to the OC fair with his friends.  It was pretty fun.  All we did there was EAT! Andy and I had to leave early to run errands for my mom.  So, we also went to Carson.  We had dinner with all my cousins and parents (since my NY neice was there). It was cool.    On Monday, my neice's friend was arriving from NY. My brother was supposed to drive them around Hollywood, etc.  Anyway, my brother wanted me to go along with them.  I didn't have a problem with that as long as we don't get home too late.  I used to be a night person but ever since I got this job, I don't have a choice. I have to be a morning person!  Hehe.  I was very irritated because we didn't leave my bro's house till around 9:30pm.  We were supposed to leave at 7pm (when traffic sorta dies out).  I didn't get home till around 3am! My brother is such a night person...even if he works at 9am.  I had fun that night but I was also kind of irritated at the same time! Last night, my brother and neice came over to pick up his computer.  Andy fixed his work computer because a virus kind of messed it up.  So, I was expecting him to come over sometime in the evening.  I finally called him asking if he already left but he didn't get here till midnight!  I asked him if I can just go to sleep and leave the door unlocked for him so he can pick up the computer.  He agreed to it but then at the last moment...he asked for me to stay up for them!  So, I did! Geez...I can't believe I DON'T WANT TO stay up so late anymore! =) Oh yeah, since I work in Garden Grove, (which is not far from Long Beach), I asked him to just pick it up before he goes to work.  He didn't want to because he DOESN'T WANT to wake up early!  Selfish bastard!  Haha...only kidding!  We're opposites now! Oh well.

      Okay...I'm finally back! &nbsp; I just posted an entry from July 9, 2004. I've been going through a lot, so my entries are kinda too LONG!&nbsp; That's just a little warning for you! &nbsp; So, on Monday, July 12th, I started my new job! I still need to get used to the idea that I'm a full time worker now!&nbsp; With everything's that's been going on, I've been so tired! Also, on Monday, my dad FINALLY left the hospital to go back home! He's been in the hospital for 17 days.&nbsp; Anyway, we were all shocked when we found out that they were going to release him on Monday.&nbsp; We were just waiting for the time when they would move him on to another floor for rehab and therapy.&nbsp; I guess they thought he was doing well enough to go home and just get therapy at home!&nbsp; Since we knew he was going home, we decided that it was time to break the news to my dad...regarding his brother's death.&nbsp; The doctor suggested to tell him in the hospital just in case anything were to happen.&nbsp; My dad can be a very emotional and dramatic person so we were all kind of nervous.&nbsp; Before he was going to receive the bad news, we made sure to give him a sedative to relax him.&nbsp; My dad's relatives visited him in the hospital (both local and from san francisco, etc.)&nbsp; My brother and I weren't there because we were at work!&nbsp; We just thought it would be important for his relatives to tell him.&nbsp; So, his other brother (with other relatives) told him the news!&nbsp; He was crying but was also kind of mellow at the same time!&nbsp; I felt so much better just knowing he knew!&nbsp; After work, I went to visit him at the hospital and to take him home from the hospital.&nbsp; He was so happy to be home.&nbsp; I don't blame him!&nbsp; That same night that I saw him, he never mentioned anything regarding my uncle.&nbsp; I wonder what he's been thinking about.&nbsp;  &nbsp; On Wednesday, I went to my uncle's viewing with my brother.&nbsp; I just met him at his house in Long Beach so we can go together.&nbsp; I saw a lot of relatives that I haven't seen in a looong time!&nbsp; My uncle looked very peaceful and just looked like he was sleeping.&nbsp; I'm so used to seeing dead people look scary and puffy....But I thought my uncle looked pretty good!&nbsp; After the viewing, we decided to visit my parents.&nbsp; My dad can't drive right now so he asked if I can spend the night.&nbsp; I couldn't because I had work!&nbsp; He basically wanted me to stay there over night so I can take him to his friend's flower shop and order flowers for my uncle.&nbsp; Since I couldn't stay, I told him that I'd just order it for him but for some reason, he really wanted to get it himself!&nbsp; Well, the following day, my cousin ended up taking him to the flower shop.&nbsp; They ordered a huge flower arrangement with a stand!&nbsp; It was really nice!&nbsp; Anyway, my mom didn't even want my dad to go to the viewing and the funeral but my brother and I thought it would be better for my dad to go only&nbsp;if he really wanted to....and of course, he did.&nbsp; We just told him that he should go to the viewing once and we'll see how he handles it.&nbsp; If he handles it pretty well, he'll also go to the funeral.&nbsp; He ended up borrowing my uncle's wheelchair.&nbsp; We gave him a sedative before the viewing and the funeral.&nbsp; When we went to the viewing on Friday, he did pretty good.&nbsp; He was sad but he didn't even cry.&nbsp; Today, during the funeral, he let out a good cry!&nbsp; My aunt was worried but he still needed to get it out somehow.&nbsp; I know that if he didn't have the medication, he'd be more dramatic!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Now that my dad is back home and the funeral is done and over with, our lives can slowly get back to normal.&nbsp; I've been so tired and stressed lately!&nbsp; I'm pretty sure my whole family feels that way.&nbsp; My brother's wife feels like a single mommy now but at the same time, she understands!&nbsp; Since I haven't spent much time with Andy in a while, I was looking forward to spending time with him after the funeral and on Sunday.&nbsp; Little did I know that he already made plans to go to his friend's house to work on his backyard.&nbsp; I was sooo sad!&nbsp; I ended up just crying and telling him that after all the stressful things I've been going through, I was sooo looking forward to just spending time with him!&nbsp; He didn't know it was that big of a deal to me so he cancelled with his friend, and now we finally get to have a whole day together!&nbsp; I'm such a baby huh?! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

        (June 9, 2004...typing this entry in the hospital)   &nbsp; things that i (and/or) my family has been going through:  1. my dad had a heart attack  2. i had an interview scheduled (finally)  3. we took my dad to the ER  4. he went through open heart surgery (2 bypasses)  5. i had my interview and was offered the job!  6. my dad seemed like he was getting better but then he always had a high fever at night  7. at times, my dad seemed so confused and talked about the WEIRDEST things  8. they decided to get some testing done so he did a CT scan and it came out negative  9. i was already supposed to start working but didn't go in yet because my mom needs to be with him 24/7. (he's not happy here so he always tries to get up and leave. we also can't leave him because if he gets up, he might fall. my boss was pretty nice about it and even said that if i needed to take more time off to just let her know.  10. the confusion continues....doctors decided to have my dad do an MRI! the results came back as positive. it showed that my dad had TWO STROKES DURING HIS SURGERY!  11. we find out that despite the strokes, my dad is getting better and was going to move to the second floor for rehab and therapy.  12. his move was delayed because he had a high fever...again.  13. my dad got upset because he's so bored here!  14. he had another blood transfusion because his hemoglobin was so low.  15. they're not moving him to the rehab floor until he's more stable.  16. not only that....we received TERRIBLE news yesterday regarding my dad's brother (my uncle)....who he's close to! he passed away yesterday suddenly and my dad doesn't even know!  my family and i are going through a lot!  this has all been so physically and mentally exhausting for me and my family. my mom and i basically work in 12 hour shifts. she usually stays at the hospital during the night and i come in duirng the day. my brother also comes in between. he can't stay as long because he already has a family and a baby who's only one month old. sometimes i get so stressed, tired, and emotional. last monday, i just broke down in tears. i didn't want anyone to see but andy noticed. he really wanted me to go home and get some rest...but that didn't happen.  anyway, my family and i are trying to figure out how and when we should break the news to my dad...regarding my uncle's death. so, earlier today, i was alone with my dad and the doctor (surgeon) came in to see how he was doing. he did what he had to do and then he walked out of the room. i told my dad that i had to go to the restroom when i really wanted to talk to the doctor. i told him the situation about my dad's brother's sudden passing. he basically said that his heart should handle it...esp. since it has been fixed. he, of course might be really upset but that he's physically able to handle it. he just suggested to give him a little more time before we break the news to him....at least till monday. so, if my dad ends up going to the funeral, he'll most likely be in a wheelchair. i just hope he gets released by that time. so, right now, we're telling all of his relatives that visit him to not say anything regarding the death. thankfully, everyone has been so understanding. this just feels so weird....to keep this big secret. my mom was hesitant w/ telling him. she didn't want to tell him at all. i understand her point....cuz she's worried about his health. but my suggestion was just to see what the doctor says. it would be so weird for my dad to go back home and then all of a sudden, his brother isn't around. he'll probably never forgive us if we never tell him. omg...so stressful.  earlier this evening, my brother and i went to my uncel's house for the prayer. i wasn't planning on going cuz there was no one else around to watch my dad. andy was coming over but i didn't want to leave him alone with my dad. but since i have such a great bf, he was really understanding and wanted me to attend the prayer. so, that's what happened. my brother picked me up while andy stayed in the hospital to watch my dad. while andy was there, he pulled out his IV! my dad is just so irritated! poor him. so, we got to the house for the prayer and saw all my cousins! i'm still so much in shock. as i was telling the doctor, my voice was shaky cuz i almost cried. i feel bad for both sides. i feel bad...obviously, cuz my uncle died and i feel bad for my dad...for keeping this big secret from him.  this weekend is my cousin's wedding in san francisco. before my brother had his baby, he was so excited because he was thinking that they can take their first road trip and show their baby to the rest of the family. that's not happening because maya hasn't gotten all her shots yet and she hasn't even been baptized. so, my mom was thinking that andy, my mom, dad, and i will go. well, obviously, that's not happening! also, my dad's side of the family was going. they were supposed to leave tonight....but that's not happening either!  my uncle was so excited to go to the wedding. he was so excited to see all of his relatives. he wanted to get his watch fixed before they leave for the wedding, so he went to a jewelry shop somewhere in carson. i guess next door, there was a fish market and he gave his friend some money to buy fish while he gets his watch fixed in the jewelry store. all of a sudden, his friend heard a loud noise and saw my uncle on the floor. the people at the store immediately called 911 but they weren't able to revive him. he was gone so fast!! =(  so, that's what has been going on with me. andy is also sad...cuz he misses me...at least that's what he says. he's been so supportive during this time! i haven't spent time with him in a loooong time. i've been spending most of my time in the hospital or in carson...sleeping. he came to the hospital today but i still didn't spend that much time with him since we went to the prayer. his parents also came to the hospital to visit today but i didn't get to see them.

      So, I've been going back and forth to visit my dad at the hospital everyday. I feel like I should be there...not only for my dad but for my mom! For the past few days, I've been feeling bad because I'm not there as often as I'd like. My brother is there more often and he has a new family. My situation is kind of different. My car is working now (for the most part) but for some reason, we can't get it to pass smog. I've already paid for the registration but in order to get my stickers, I need to pass freakin' smog! So, on Monday, my brother picked me up and dropped me off just so I can see my dad. On Tuesday, I waited for Andy to come home so we both can visit. Today (Wednesday), I drove my car & dropped it off at my parent's house so I can drive my dad's camry to the hospital. I might be doing the same thing again tomorrow. Thank goodness my mom feels strong enough to spend the night at home. Otherwise, she'd probably be so weak by now! Also, thank goodness my aunt is with her. They've been sleeping @ my mom's house and going to the hospital in the mornings together! But tomorrow my aunt wont be able to go with her in the morning because she has to babysit Justin and Kayla. So, after my doctor's appointment tomorrow, I'll be going to the hospital (again) to keep my mom company.   My dad seems to be doing better for the most part. They say that he does pretty good during the mornings and throughout the afternoon but after that, it's a different story. For some reason, he gets confused. At times, he'll even think he's at the gas station. He can make the most funniest comments though! Hehe. Poor dad! But anyway, I don't know when they'll release him. They're still doing tests on him because he's been having a high temp. ever since his surgery. It's never gone down and they can't figure it out. They do think that he may be confused because of his high temp.! Who knows? They're also supposed to be doing a CT scan and an MRI just to make sure nothing happened in his brain and also to make sure that he didn't have a stroke while he was going through surgery. On another note, at times, I don't think my parents get along that great but ever since this incident, I can't believe how much love I see between my parents. It makes me wanna cry!

      This will probably sound weird but I miss Andy.  We haven't had time to ourselves for a while!  We have just been busy with everything and everyone else, I guess.  This past Wednesday, Andy took a half-day just so he can take my NY neice to the airport.  Isn't that nice?  Hehe.  I was supposed to take her but it's much easier for Andy to leave work earlier than it is for me!  If I did, I'd have some MAJOR catching up to do.    The little outting with my coworkers didn't happen last night.  Everyone was planning on going but for some reason, at the last minute, a majority of the staff had something else to do.  Isn't that sad?  They planned a goodbye/goodluck dinner for that guy and that didn't even happen.  Actually, yesterday was probably a bad night, even for Tony because something's wrong with his knee.  Apparently, he went to get it checked out that night and it just took longer than expected.  We ended up still going out around midnight with that guy that left and two other coworkers.  It was alright!   Anyway, I just got back from spending the day with my friend, Grace.  Andy went to work today so I went to Carson by myself.  I had to go there because it was Jackie's son's 1st birthday.  I ended up just tagging along with Grace, Tony, and Gavin!  After that party, Grace and I went to Lynce's grandma's birthday.  It was cool...esp. since we got to see Lynette and her kids!  I haven't seen them for so long!  I'm also excited because I get to see them again tomorrow.  My friends are having a bon-fire so that's my plan for tomorrow.  Andy wont be able to go because he already made plans to go to his friend's house to work on some landscaping in the backyard.  Oh well.  I'm sleepy so GOOD NIGHT! =)
